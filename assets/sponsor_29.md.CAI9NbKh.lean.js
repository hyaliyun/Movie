The Betaproteobacteria are a class comprising over 75 genera and 400 species of bacteria. Together, the Betaproteobacteria represent a broad variety of metabolic strategies and occupy diverse environments from obligate pathogens living within host organisms to oligotrophic groundwater ecosystems. Whilst most members of the Betaproteobacteria are heterotrophic, deriving both their carbon and electrons from organocarbon sources, some are photoheterotrophic, deriving energy from light and carbon from organocarbon sources. Other genera are autotrophic, deriving their carbon from bicarbonate or carbon dioxide and their electrons from reduced inorganic ions such as nitrite, ammonium, thiosulfate or sulfide ‚Äî many of these chemolithoautotrophic. Betaproteobacteria are economically important, with roles in maintaining soil pH and in elementary cycling. Other economically important members of the Betaproteobacteria are able to use nitrate as their terminal electron acceptor and can be used industrially to remove nitrate from wastewater by denitrification. A number of Betaproteobacteria are diazotrophs, meaning that they can fix molecular nitrogen from the air as their nitrogen source for growth - this is important to the farming industry as it is a primary means of ammonium levels in soils rising without the presence of leguminous plants. Phylogeny The Betaproteobacteria are one of the eight classes that make up the \\"Proteobacteria\\". The Betaproteobacteria are most closely related to the Gammaproteobacteria, Acidithiobacillia and Hydrogenophilalia, and together they make up a taxon which has previously been called \\"Chromatibacteria\\". Four orders of Betaproteobacteria are currently recognised ‚Äî the Burkholderiales, the Neisseriales, the Nitrosomonadales and the Rhodocyclales. The name \\"Procabacteriales\\" was also proposed for an order of endosymbionts of Acanthamoeba, but since they cannot be grown in culture and studies have been limited, the name has never been validly or effectively published, and thus is no more than a nickname without any standing in nomenclature. An extensive reclassification of families and orders of the class based on a polyphasic analysis (including 16S rRNA gene analyses and 53-protein ribosomal protein concatamer analyses using the rMLST Multilocus sequence typing system) was published in 2017, that removed the order Hydrogenophilales from the class and into a novel class of the \\"Proteobacteria\\", the Hydrogenophilalia. The same study also merged the former order Methylophilales into the Nitrosomonadales. The four orders of the Betaproteobactera are sub-divided into families: Burkholderiales (type order) comprises the families Burkholderiacae (type family), Alcaliginaceae, Commamonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae and Sutterellaceae. The order Burkholderiales comprises a range of morphologies, including rods, curved rods, cocci, spirillae and multicellular 'tablets'. Both heterotrophs and photoheterotrophs are found along with some facultative autotrophs. Neisseriales comprises the families Neisseriaceae (type family) and Chromobacteriaceae. The order Neisseriales comprises morphologies including cocci, curved rods, spirillae, rods, multicellular ribbons and filaments. Most organisms are heterotrophs with some facultative methylotrophs and chemolithoheterotrophs. Nitrosomonadales comprises the families Nitrosomonadaceae (type family), Methylophilacae, Thiobacillaceae, Sterolibacteriacae, Spirillaceae and Gallionellaceae. The order comprises morphologies including rods, spirillae and curved rods. Most organisms are chemolithoautotrophs with some methylotrophs and heterotrophs Rhodocyclales comprises the families Rhodocyclaceae (type family), Azonexaceae and Zoogloeaceae. Morphologies include rods, curved rods, rings, spirillae and cocci. Most species in this order are heterotrophs with some photoheterotrophs and chemolithoautotrophs. Role in disease Some members of the Betaproteobacteria can cause disease in various eukaryotic organisms, including in humans, such as members of the genus Neisseria: N. gonorrhoeae and N. meninngitides being primary examples, which cause gonorrhea and meningitis respectively, as well as Bordetella pertussis which causes whooping cough. Other members of the class can infect plants, such as Burkholderia cepacia which causes bulb rot in onions as well as Xylophilus ampelinus which causes necrosis of grapevines. Economic Importance Various human activities, such as fertilizer production and chemical plant usage, release significant amounts of ammonium ions into rivers and oceans. Ammonium buildup in aquatic environments is potentially dangerous because high ammonium content can lead to eutrophication. Biological wastewater treatment systems, as well as other biological ammonium-removing methods, depend on the metabolism of various Bacteria including members of the Nitrosomonadales of the Betaproteobacteria that undergo nitrification and a wide range of organisms capable of denitrification to remove excessive ammonia from wastewater by first oxidation into nitrate and then nitrite and then reduction into molecular nitrogen gas, which leaves the ecosystem and is carried into the atmosphere.

Its members are highly diverse and possess few commonalities, but nevertheless share a common ancestor. Like all Proteobacteria, its members are gram-negative and some of its intracellular parasitic members lack peptidoglycan and are consequently gram variable. Characteristics The Alphaproteobacteria are a diverse taxon and comprises several phototrophic genera, several genera metabolising C1-compounds (e.g., Methylobacterium spp.), symbionts of plants (e.g., Rhizobium spp.), endosymbionts of arthropods (Wolbachia) and intracellular pathogens (e.g. Rickettsia). Moreover, the class includes (as an extinct member) the protomitochondrion, the bacterium that was engulfed by the eukaryotic ancestor and gave rise to the mitochondria, which are organelles in eukaryotic cells (See endosymbiotic theory). A species of technological interest is Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens): scientists often use this species to transfer foreign DNA into plant genomes. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, such as Pelagibacter ubique, are alphaproteobacteria that are a widely distributed and may constitute over 10% of the open ocean microbial community. Evolution and genomics There is some disagreement on the phylogeny of the orders, especially for the location of the Pelagibacterales, but overall there is some consensus. The discord stems from the large difference in gene content (e.g. genome streamlining in Pelagibacter ubique) and the large difference in GC-richness between members of several orders. Specifically, Pelagibacterales, Rickettsiales and Holosporales contain species with AT-rich genomes. It has been argued that it could be a case of convergent evolution that would result in an artefactual clustering. However, several studies disagree. Furthermore, it has been found that the GC-content of ribosomal RNA (the traditional phylogenetic marker for prokaryotes) little reflects the GC-content of the genome. One example of this atypical decorrelation of ribosomal GC-content with phylogeny is that members of the Holosporales have a much higher ribosomal GC-content than members of the Pelagibacterales and Rickettsiales, even though they are more closely related to species with high genomic GC-contents than to members of the latter two orders. The Class Alphaproteobacteria is divided into three subclasses Magnetococcidae, Rickettsidae and Caulobacteridae. The basal group is Magnetococcidae, which is composed by a large diversity of magnetotactic bacteria, but only one is described, Magnetococcus marinus. The Rickettsidae is composed of the intracellular Rickettsiales and the free-living Pelagibacterales. The Caulobacteridae is composed of the Holosporales, Rhodospirillales, Sphingomonadales, Rhodobacterales, Caulobacterales, Kiloniellales, Kordiimonadales, Parvularculales and Sneathiellales. Comparative analyses of the sequenced genomes have also led to discovery of many conserved insertion-deletions (indels) in widely distributed proteins and whole proteins (i.e. signature proteins) that are distinctive characteristics of either all Alphaproteobacteria, or their different main orders (viz. Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rickettsiales, Sphingomonadales and Caulobacterales) and families (viz. Rickettsiaceae, Anaplasmataceae, Rhodospirillaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Bradyrhiozobiaceae, Brucellaceae and Bartonellaceae). These molecular signatures provide novel means for the circumscription of these taxonomic groups and for identification/assignment of new species into these groups. Phylogenetic analyses and conserved indels in large numbers of other proteins provide evidence that Alphaproteobacteria have branched off later than most other phyla and Classes of Bacteria except Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Phylogeny The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 106 by 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project. Notes: ‚ô† Strains found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) but not listed in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LSPN). Aquaspirillum is now regarded to belong to Betaproteobacteria. A newer tree based on 16S and 23S rRNA (and other data) is given by Ferla et al. (2013) as follows: Natural genetic transformation Although only a few studies have been reported on natural genetic transformation in the Alphaproteobacteria, this process has been described in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Methylobacterium organophilum, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Natural genetic transformation is a sexual process involving DNA transfer from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium, and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination.

They contained boilers that provided the power to pumps that created the partial vacuum to move the trains. Three of them still stand largely intact alongside the line.  History  The South Devon Railway was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel who proposed moving the trains by atmospheric power. Brunel and other engineers travelled to Dalkey in Ireland in 1843 to view such a system undergoing tests on the Dublin and Kingstown Railway. There, Brunel's engineer of locomotives for the GWR, Daniel Gooch, calculated that conventional locomotives could work the proposed line at lower cost, but Brunel's concerns about the heavy grades led him to try the system regardless. The South Devon Railway directors agreed on 28 August 1844 to Brunel's proposal to use atmospheric power on their line. Brunel estimated that by reducing the double-track locomotive worked line to a single track atmospheric line a saving of ¬£8,000 per year could be made. Double track lines were favoured at that time even for lightly worked lines as this reduced the chances of a collision between trains, but the atmospheric system precludes the possibility of two trains travelling in opposite directions on the same section of track. The pipes were ordered from George Hennet, an engineering contractor who worked on many of Brunel's lines. He established a factory at Bridgwater, Somerset, to make them. The line opened with conventional steam locomotives to Teignmouth on 30 May 1846 and was extended to Newton on 30 December 1846. The first piston carriage (which connected the train to the pipe) was delivered on 25 February 1847 and experimental running with atmospheric power started immediately. Public services were run to Teignmouth from 13 September 1847 and extended to Newton from 10 January 1848. At this time some trains were still worked by locomotives, but from 23 February 1848 all scheduled trains were powered by the atmospheric system. The leather valve along the top of the pipe tended to dry out and air could then leak in, but this was mitigated slightly by the passing trains spraying water on the leather. The harsh environment of the line, which runs adjacent to the sea for much of its length and is often soaked with salt spray, presented difficulties in maintaining the leather flaps provided to seal the vacuum pipes, which had to be kept supple by being greased with tallow; even so, air leaked in, reducing the pressure difference. Many trains arrived at Exeter from the Bristol and Exeter Railway very late. Because the South Devon line was only equipped with a telegraph that linked the stations, the engines had to start pumping for when the timetable said that the trains were due to enter their section and then keep pumping until the train eventually passed. This meant that the engines pumped for twice as long as was necessary and meant that much more coke was consumed than would have been the case if pumping had only been undertaken when the train was actually ready to be run. The engine houses were connected to the telegraph system on 2 August 1848 but a lack of trained staff meant that it was not fully used. The railway company had set up a committee to investigate the efficiency of atmospheric working on 23 May 1848. In August Brunel gave a lengthy report on the system, and discussions with Joseph Samuda were held with a view to making repairs to the valve and guaranteeing its operation. On 29 August 1848 the directors, following Brunel's advice, recommended to the shareholders the suspension of atmospheric working. Atmospheric-powered service thus lasted less than a year, to 9 September 1848; the last engine pumping was at Exeter, where an up goods train arrived in the early hours of 10 September. The engines and buildings were sold to other users, and most of the pipes were sold back to George Hennet for scrap. The atmospheric had cost the railway over ¬£433,000 and about ¬£81,000 was raised from the sales of redundant materials. (Reprinted by Alan Sutton Publishing, 1985 () Despite the building of engine houses on towards Plymouth and on the Torquay branch the system never expanded beyond Newton. Similarly, the proposal to use the same system on Brunel's Cornwall Railway between Plymouth, Falmouth and Padstow was not pursued. Three of the engine houses (Starcross, Torquay and Totnes) are still standing and the location of two others (Turf and Dawlish) are clearly visible. A section of the pipe, without the leather covers, is preserved at Didcot Railway Centre mounted on a short section of track which is inclined to show the gradient of the line from Newton to Dainton. Technical details A reconstructed section of atmospheric track at Didcot Railway Centre The system was designed and patented by the Samuda Brothers. The pipe was laid in sections between the broad gauge rails with a continuous slot along the top that was sealed by a leather valve. The buildings that housed the boilers and engines were built in a decorative Italianate style with square chimneys and spaced at around intervals. The 1845 contract for 24 engines comprised sixteen of 33 inch cylinder diameter (approx 45HP), and eight of 12HP, and was split between Boulton and Watt and 'Messrs Rennie',Atmospheric Railway Engines, The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's magazine, February 1845, p139 probably J. and G. Rennie. The engine that pumped each section was the one towards which the train was travelling, for example a train leaving Exeter was powered by the Countess Wear engine creating a partial vacuum in the pipe in front of the train which was then propelled forward by the normal atmospheric pressure in the pipe behind the train's piston. Pumping started up to eight minutes before the scheduled departure of the train so as to build up a sufficient vacuum. At stations a smaller pipe was laid alongside the track and a piston in this was connected to the train by a rope to start it moving. On arrival at the next station it was up to the driver to bring the train to a stop using its brakes. Engine houses were situated at every station except Exeter St Thomas where the driver had to hold the train against the atmospheric pressure with the brakes. The level portions used pipes but the steeper gradients west of Newton were to have used pipes. It is not clear how the change between the two pipe sizes would have been achieved unless the piston carriages were changed at Newton. It is also unclear how the level crossing at Turf was operated as the pipe projected some way above the rails. Speeds of up to 70 mph (112 km/h) were achieved, but service speeds were usually around 40 mph (64 km/h). The timetable allowed 55 minutes for the journey, but records show that 36% of trains arrived more than five minutes early, some by more than ten minutes. Engine house remains =Turf= The remains of Turf engine house can be seen on the river side of the line just where the railway comes alongside the River Exe near Turf Lock, the entrance to the Exeter Canal. The square pond surrounded by trees on the river side of the line was the main water reservoir. Just to the south of this, the foundations of some buildings can be seen. This was where the engine house itself was built, although some of the foundations are from later alterations. The building was demolished about 1860 and the stone used in a nearby farm. =Starcross= Starcross The most familiar engine house, and the most intact one which actually saw service, is situated on the landward side of the line at the south end of Starcross railway station. The chimney, reduced in height for safety many years ago, had for a while a new pitched roof, but it has since been removed. Unlike the other engine houses this one is built of Heavitree stone from Exeter, a coarse red sandstone that has not weathered well. The accompanying photograph from 2007 shows the original wall along the narrow street called The Strand, but within the next decade it had to be rebuilt with a concrete surface painted to resemble stones. After the engines ceased work, the boiler house was used by coal merchants until 1981. The engine area was used as a Wesleyan Church from 1867 to 1958, after which it was used as a youth club for a few years. The whole building was sold and reopened as a museum for the atmospheric railway in 1982. This has since closed and the building was developed internally for use by the local Starcross Fishing and Cruising Club. =Dawlish= Although largely demolished in 1873, part of the engine house wall can be seen at the back of Dawlish railway station car park. =Torquay= Torquay By the time the railway opened to Torquay the decision had already been made to abandon atmospheric working, so this engine house was never used. However it was completed and is the surviving example with the least amount of exterior modification. It is also the one least easy to see from trains; it is about on the side of (on the right hand side of the line approaching from Newton Abbot) but is on a higher level above the line. It can be more easily viewed from a supermarket car park in Newton Road. The location so far from the terminal but uphill from it shows that southbound trains were intended to run the last mile by gravity. =Totnes= Totnes The engine house adjacent to Totnes railway station was never brought into use. It was converted for use as a milk processing plant for Dairy Crest but this has since closed. The original chimney, still present in a photograph of 1925, was removed many years ago.

The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20), NY 5, and NY 21 just south of downtown Canandaigua. Its northern terminus is located at the toll barrier preceding New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90) exit 44 in Farmington. NY 332 is the primary route for travelers destined for Canandaigua from locales such as Rochester and Victor to the northwest of the city. Within the Canandaigua city limits, NY 332 is Main Street, a major arterial through downtown lined with numerous shops, stores and points of interest. At the city line, the route becomes Rochester Road and the surroundings become more rural, with the number of businesses continually decreasing to where no structures are present on the road. Farther north in Farmington, a small cluster of establishments centered on the intersection with NY 96 represents the last major commercial location on NY 332 before it ends at the Thruway. The route is four lanes wide along its entire length. NY 332 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, originally beginning at West Avenue (then part of US 20 and NY 5) in Canandaigua and ending at NY 96 in Farmington. The route was extended north to meet the New York State Thruway in 1954 and extended south to its current terminus following the completion of the Western Bypass around Canandaigua in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Route description =Canandaigua= Although NY 332 begins at the intersection of South Main Street and US 20 and NY 5 in Canandaigua, state maintenance of Main Street begins south of Routes 5 and 20 at Lakeshore Drive, where Main Street becomes NY 942T, an unsigned reference route. Main Street, a two-lane road providing access to the Canandaigua Lake boat launch south of this point, widens to four lanes in preparation for the junction with NY 5, US 20 and NY 21 immediately south of downtown. At the intersection, South Main Street loses the NY 942T designation and becomes NY 332\\\\. NY 21, concurrent with Routes 5 and 20 west of Main Street, separates from NY 5 and US 20 and turns north onto Main Street, joining NY 332 to form an overlap northward through downtown Canandaigua. alt=A wide street with two-lane roadways in either direction and older commercial buildings on either side, seen from a grassy median with the American flag flying from a low post in the center Near the city center, NY 21 and NY 332 intersect Bristol Street, the former path of NY 21 out of the city. Four blocks north, the overlap passes West Avenue, the former routing of NY 5 and US 20 into Canandaigua. This junction was also once the southern terminus of NY 88; however, the route has since been truncated to Phelps. After traversing another three blocks, the concurrency with NY 21 splits at Gibson Street as NY 21 follows Gibson out of Canandaigua towards Manchester and Palmyra. Route 332, which changes from South Main Street to North Main Street at West Avenue, continues north through the city, becoming a four-lane divided highway and passing into the town of Canandaigua at North Road. =Canandaigua to Farmington= The level of development along NY 332 begins to decline as the roadway heads north from Canandaigua. The road winds to the northwest, traversing the rural northern portion of Canandaigua before passing seamlessly into the town of Farmington. Upon crossing the town line, development along the road rises once more, increasing in density as NY 332 approaches NY 96\\\\. The two routes meet roughly from the Canandaigua‚ÄìFarmington line at an intersection near the Finger Lakes Gaming and Race Track, situated to the southeast, and East Victor, a hamlet located on NY 96 to the west. Past the bustling intersection, the landscape surrounding NY 332 reverts to a rural setting as the road continues to the northwest. NY 332 southbound at NY 96 in Farmington Less than a mile from the Thruway, NY 332 intersects Collett Road, the final roadway to cross the median of NY 332, at a four-way signalized intersection prior to crossing over the Ontario Central Railroad via an overpass. Midway between the Thruway toll barrier and the railroad, NY 332 north intersects Loomis Road while NY 332 south meets Gateway Drive. Due to the closed median, only right turns are permitted, both from NY 332 and the intersecting roads. In the north of the junction, the divided highway, in place from the Canandaigua city line northward, comes to an end, briefly making NY 332 a six-lane undivided highway before the designation terminates at the toll plaza for exit 44 of the New York State Thruway. The connection to the Thruway makes NY 332 the primary route for travelers destined for Canandaigua from locales to the northwest such as Rochester and Victor. History NY 332 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a north-south connector between US 20 and NY 5 (West Avenue) in Canandaigua and NY 15 (now NY 96) in Farmington. South of West Avenue, Main Street carried US 20 and NY 5 to Lakeshore Drive, where the two routes veered eastward. Between Gibson Street and Bristol Street, NY 332 and US 20 / NY 5 were concurrent to NY 21.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering When the portion of the Thruway from Rochester east to the Westmoreland hamlet of Lowell opened on June 24, 1954, NY 332 was extended north to its present northern terminus, meeting the Thruway at exit 44. Northern terminus of NY 332 at the New York State Thruway in Farmington In the mid-1950s, a new bypass (known as the Eastern Bypass) was built north of Lakeshore Drive from South Main Street to Hopewell. The highway became part of a rerouted US 20 and NY 5 by 1956. A continuation of the bypass (named the Western Bypass) around the southwestern portion of Canandaigua between West Avenue Extension and South Main Street was built in the late 1970s and opened to traffic as a realignment of US 20 and NY 5 by 1981. Following its completion, NY 21 was realigned onto the bypass between Bristol and South Main Streets. NY 21 turned north onto South Main Street, rejoining its previous alignment at Bristol Street. Additionally, NY 332 was extended southward from West Avenue to its present southern terminus at the Western/Eastern Bypass connection point, prolonging the already-existing overlap with NY 21 in the process. The former routing of US 20 / NY 5 on South Main Street south of NY 332 remains state maintained as unsigned NY 942T. The portion of NY 332 from the Canandaigua city line north to the Thruway toll barrier for exit 44 was originally a two-lane undivided roadway. Due to commercial and residential growth along the corridor, improvements were necessary to increase the capacity of the route. In 1994, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) initiated a project to double the width of NY 332, turning the route into a four-lane divided highway with a restrictive median. Construction was completed eight years later. The restrictive median in place on NY 332 enables the existence of center turning lanes for each road the route intersects; however, the median prevents access to businesses on the opposite side of the road.

He attempted to introduce reforms based on the practices of the British Royal Navy, and led raids on Moorish targets along the Barbary Coast in retaliation for corsair attacks on Venetian-flagged shipping. Biography =Early life and career= Angelo Emo was born in Venice on 3 January 1731, to a distinguished aristocratic family. His father was Giovanni di Gabriele and his mother was Lucia Lombardo. He was educated at the Jesuit college in Brescia, before returning to Vencie, where which his father chose as his tutors the scholars , Jacopo Stellini, and Carlo Lodoli. In 1751 he entered service in the Venetian navy as a nobile di nave (gentleman cadet), going on his first sea voyage in the same year. Already in 1755 he was captain of a warship, distinguishing himself in convoy escort duties against the attacks of pirates. In 1758 he was charged to lead an expedition to the Atlantic Ocean in order to escort home Venetian merchant vessels and conclude a new trade agreement with Portugal. During this mission he encountered a tempest that lasted for two months and confined his ship, the San Carlo, to the coasts; during this storm he narrowly escaped shipwreck and gave proof of his seamanship and command skills, earning universal acclaim on his return to Venice in August 1759. =Rise to high command and state offices= Bust of Angelo Emo, by Pietro Zandomeneghi (1862-1863) In 1760 he was Provvedditore della Sanit√† (health commissioner), but in the next year he was commander of a squadron of one ship of the line and two frigates, sent against the Barbary pirates praying on Venetian shipping. Until 1767 he alternated between anti- piracy commands and public office in Venice. As Savio ed Esecutore alle Acque (water commissioner) in 1761‚Äì62, he commissioned a plan of the Venetian Lagoon, which was completed in six months. In 1763 he was elected to the higher command rank of Patron delle Navi (rear admiral of the sailing fleet) and patrolled the Adriatic Sea. In 1765 he was promoted to Almirante (vice admiral of the sailing fleet), and in 1767‚Äì68 he forced the Dey of Algiers to conclude a favourable peace treaty with the Republic of Venice. During this campaign, he again narrowly escaped shipwreck due to a storm aboard the 74-gun ship Ercole. On 12 June 1768, he was raised to Capitano delle Navi, full admiral of the sailing fleet. When the Russian fleet under Alexei Orlov arrived in the Mediterranean in 1770 as part of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774, Emo led a Venetian squadron to a cruise in the Aegean, to protect Venetian and French subjects and commercial interests in the area. The conflict also saw raids by the Dulcigno pirates, ostensibly acting as subjects of the Sultan, in the Venetian Ionian Islands. Emo sailed against them, but his fleet suffered heavy losses when it was caught by a storm near Cape Matapan on 19 December 1771: half his squadron, the 74-gun ship Corriera and the frigate Tolleranza, foundered, the former with almost all hands; Emo's own flagship, the Ercole, only survived by cutting her masts. In 1772 he departed his naval duties and entered the Venetian Senate. Elected several times as censor, he worked to revive the manufacture of Murano glass. In 1776‚Äì1778, as a Savio alle Acque, he was responsible for several maintenance works around the Lagoon, on the Brenta River, the Terraglio road, and the canal of Cava. On 18 July 1778 Emo was again elected Capitano delle Navi, hoisting his flag on the heavy frigate Sirena, to deal with the provocations of the Pashalik of Tripolitania, which tried to exploit the \\"right of earch\\" accorded to them by treaty on Venetian shipping beyond the agreed-upon limits. Emo led his fleet in a demonstration of force in front of Tripoli, forcing the pasha to conclude a new peace agreement with the Republic. Emo's appointment was renewed for the year after, but no actions took place. In 1779 he was a Savio alla Mercanzia (trade commissioner) he promoted reforms such as the reduction of tax on silk, the opening of new shops at Sebenico, and the transfer of the Venetian consulate in Egypt from Cairo to the port city of Alexandria. In 1780 he was a Provveditore ai Beni Inculti (commissioner on uncultivated lands) and laid out plans for the draining of the Adige marshlands around Verona, a project begun already by Zaccaria Betti. However, once again due to lack of funds, the plans were not carried out. In 1782‚Äì1784 he served as director of the Venetian Arsenal (Inquisitore all'Arsenale), which he restored and reformed, beginning construction of new models of ships, imported from England and France, introducing copper sheathing, improved the methods for the manufacture of hawsers and rigging, and increased the salaries of non-noble officers. In 1783 he led the negotiations with the Habsburg envoy Ludwig von Cobenzl on freedom of navigation in Istria and Dalmatia. =High command against Tunis and death= Angelo Emo bombards the city of Sfax, from a drawing by Giuseppe Gatteri On 6 March 1784 he was elected as Capitano Straordinario delle Navi (commander-in-chief of the sailing fleet) against the Beylik of Tunis, which had declared war on the Republic after a Venetian ship laden with goods from the Barbary coast was burned by the authorities in Malta due to it being infected with the plague. On 21 June, Emo sailed from Venice for Corfu at the head of a squadron composed of the ships of the line Fama, Forza, and Palma, the frigates Concordia, Sirena, Brillante, Pallade, and Venere, the xebec Triton, the bombards Distruzione and Polonia, the galiot Esploratore, and the hospital ship Kav. Angelo. The fleet was soon joined by the ship of the line Concordia and the xebecs Cupido and Nettuno, but left Triton behind when it sailed for Tunisia on 12 August. On 1 September 1784, his squadron anchored at Cap Carthage, five miles from Tunis. In a series of expeditions over the next three years, he repeatedly bombarded Sousse (5 October 1784, for three nights in April 1785, and in 26 September‚Äì6 October 1787), Biserte (30 May to 10 August 1787), Sfax (15‚Äì17 August 1785, and 6, 18, and 22 March 30 April and 4 May 1786), and La Goulette (on 1, 3, 5, 9 October 1758), where he utilized floating batteries of his own invention. These operations not only caused great damage and casualties in these cities, but also confined the Tunisian fleet to its harbours. The Senate rejected his requests of a 10,000-man expeditionary force with which to assault and capture Tunis, however. Instead, in 1787, the Bey of Tunis was forced to sign a treaty with the Republic of Venice, granting it favourable trade terms: the tax rate for goods carried on Venetian merchant ships fell from 7% to 4%, although for its part the Republic was obliged to pay a lump sum of 40,000 sequins. In the meantime, on 28 May 1786, Emo had been elected Procuratore de Ultra of St Mark's Basilica. The treaty did not last long, however, before the Tunisians resumed their raids. Emo led a squadron to the Aegean against them, but lost two ships in a storm. The government of the Republic confiscated his possessions to repay the lost ships. In late 1790, the Senate named him Provveditore Generale da Mar, but did not entrust him with leading the fleet against the Tunisian coast. With the French Revolution under way in Europe, the Senate was loath to become embroiled in a prolonged conflict, and preferred peace. The Senate feared that Emo's aggressive nature would hamper these efforts, and instead placed the Almirante Tommaso Condulmer, promoted to Capitano delle Navi, in charge of the naval blockade and the peace negotiations. While waiting to join with the rest of the fleet at Malta, Emo died on 1 March 1792, reportedly from a bilious attack after learning that a peace, mostly disadvantageous to Venice, had been concluded with Tunis without his being consulted. Celebrated as a great naval hero, his body was embalmed and carried to Venice on board his flagship, the ship of the line Fama. The sculptor Antonio Canova was charged with erecting a monument to Emo. Completed in 1794, it is in the second armoury of the Venetian Arsenal. Canova was honoured by the Republic with a medal for this monument, the last such medal issued by the Republic before its end. His funeral took place at St Mark's on 17 April, and he was buried at the church of Santa Maria dei Servi. A funerary monument was erected over his tomb by Canova's teacher, Giovanni Ferrari, initially at Santa Maria dei Servi, then moved to San Martino, and finally, from 1817, to San Biagio. Legacy Following the death of his older brother, Alviso Emo, in 1790, Angelo Emo's death also meant the end of the San Simeon Piccolo branch of the Emo family. Already at the time of his death, his loss was seen as a heavy blow and symptom of the Republic's decline. Emo's reputation was enhanced further by 19th-century historians of Venice, keen on romanticizing the final decades of the Republic: Girolamo Dandolo calls him \\"the last roar issued by the Lion of St. Mark on the sea\\", while for Samuele Romanin he might have been able to \\"shake [the Republic] from the disastrous abandonment\\" and \\"inspire in her the strength and energy\\" that she sorely lacked in the final years of its existence. For Romanin, Emo was the last of the great captains of the Venetian navy, and indeed of the Republic, which \\"may indeed be said to have herself descended with him into the sepulchre\\". After him, the Venetian navy would no longer be called upon to fight. His sudden death also led to rumours that he had been poisoned. Girolamo Dandolo insisted that this was the case, and identified his deputy Tommaso Condulmer, ambitious not only to succeed him, but also to conclude a peace treaty with the Barbary states. This has been convincingly disproved by modern historians.

The term is sometimes roughly translated as science, although Wissenschaft is much broader and includes every systematic academic study of any area, for example, humanities like art or religion. Wissenschaft incorporates scientific and non-scientific inquiry, learning, knowledge, scholarship and implies that knowledge is a dynamic process discoverable for oneself, rather than something that is handed down. It did not necessarily imply empirical research. Wissenschaft was the official ideology of German universities during the 19th century, and it led to the development of the modern research university. It emphasized the unity of teaching and individual research or discovery by the student, the Einheit von Lehre und Forschung. It suggests that education is a process of growing and becoming. Some 19th- century Americans visiting German universities interpreted Wissenschaft as meaning \\"pure science,\\" untainted by social purposes and opposed to the liberal arts. Some contemporary scientists and philosophers interpret Wissenschaft as meaning any true knowledge or successful method, including philosophical, mathematical, and logical knowledge and methods.  History  Before Immanuel Kant published his Critique of Judgment in 1790, the \\"sch√∂ne Wissenschaft\\" (roughly, \\"fine sciences\\") were highly regarded. The \\"sch√∂ne Wissenschaft\\" included poetry, rhetoric, and other subjects that were meant to promote an understanding of truth, beauty, and goodness. Kant argued that aesthetic judgments were not an area of systematic knowledge, and therefore were outside the realm of Wissenschaft.  Compared to science  Although Wissenschaft and science were roughly comparable words in previous centuries, the word science in English \\"has narrowed its meaning incomparably, whereas Wissenschaft...has retained its broad meaning\\". In modern English, the word science refers to systematically acquired, objective knowledge that is about a particular subject (the workings of the natural world, including the people in it) and produced through a particular methodology (the scientific method), in a progressive, iterative process that builds on previous knowledge. Wissenschaft, by contrast, encompasses knowledge of objects as well as truths, such as what it means to be good. The difficulties of being precise about knowledge are one reason why English is not considered well-suited for discussions about epistemology, and terms from other languages, notably Latin and German, are commonly used.  See also  Phrases employing this term include the following: *Wissenschaft des Judentums, the \\"science of Judaism,\\" a 19th-century scholarly movement. *Die fr√∂hliche Wissenschaft, the title of a book written by Friedrich Nietzsche and first published in 1882. *Bildwissenschaft, an academic discipline in the German-speaking world associated with visual studies and art history References External links * Philosophy is Science Epistemology de:Wissenschaft no:Vitenskap nn:Vitskap ","title":"Wissenschaft"},{"id":"5742523","text":"Church of San Juan Bautista.

History The moving industry in the United States was deregulated with the Household Goods Transportation Act of 1980. This act allowed interstate movers to issue binding or fixed estimates for the first time. Doing so opened the door to hundreds of new moving companies to enter the industry. This led to an increase in competition and soon movers were no longer competing on services but on price. As competition drove prices lower and decreased what were already slim profit margins, \\"rogue\\" movers began hijacking personal property as part of a new scam. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) enforces Federal consumer protection regulations related to the interstate shipment of household goods (i.e., household moves that cross State lines). FMCSA has held this responsibility since 1999, and the Department of Transportation has held this responsibility since 1995 (the Interstate Commerce Commission held this authority prior to its termination in 1995). Scam There are many versions to the moving scam, but the basic scam begins with a prospective client contacting a purported licensed moving company and requesting a cost estimate. In today's market this often happens online via moving company marketing websites. These moving companies can be prone to quoting sometimes too low, but usually reasonable prices with no room for the movers to provide a gratuity incentive to provide quality service without upselling packing services. Once the moving company has secured a move by providing a non- binding or binding estimate, they arrive to pack and deliver the goods and the foreman, a trained loading professional performs a visual estimate. Often the scam movers use deceptive pricing or weight (which is not based on actual weight, figure of cubic footage) measurements including prices based on the gross weight of the moving vehicle. After packing and loading, the client is informed that their goods went over the expected weight estimate and the additional weight will be charged at a substantially higher rate (often double the original price per pound). Rogue movers will not inform a client of these discrepancies until the client's goods have been weighed at a certifiable scale, far from the client's original pickup location. The new price may be four or five times higher than the original estimate. The scam movers know that most people will be forced to pay these exorbitant rates based on their need for the personal effects. Regulation The interstate moving industry in America is regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), part of the United States Department of Transportation. Only a small staff (fewer than 20 people) is available to patrol hundreds of moving companies, making enforcement difficult. Furthermore, in the United States, there are in most cases no regulations that clearly qualify moving companies as \\"reliable\\", and thus such scams are relatively common. Moving companies can provide and often display a Department of Transportation (DOT) license. Moving companies that operate within the borders of a particular state are usually regulated by the state department of transportation or the public utilities commission or another in that state. This applies to some of the US states like in California (California Public Utilities Commission) and Texas (Texas Department of Motor Vehicles). On the other hand, there are some US federal laws which govern moving cost estimates. For instance, in the case of out-of- state moves, movers must perform an in-person survey of a client's goods before giving an estimate unless a physical survey waiver agreement is signed; furthermore, this estimate must be in writing. In addition, estimates can be either binding (a set fee, regardless of weight), binding not-to-exceed (based on weight but with a maximum fee), or non-binding (based on weight).

She achieved her legendary status as a film thespian during her film career that spanned from the 1950s up to the 1970s. During the height of her fame, she was one of the most bankable stars of Sampaguita Pictures, which used to be one of the leading Philippine movie studios of the era. Born to a Spanish-Irish father and a Spanish mother, Marlene graduated from Saint Scholastica's College in Le√≥n Guinto Street, Malate, Manila. In the beginning, she was entirely a stranger to Tagalog, then the main language used for mainstream Filipino movies because Marlene only spoke English at school and Spanish at home. When she was discovered, this proved to be the one hurdle she had to overcome before becoming a bankable star. Nevertheless, with the help of Rosa M√≠a and her sacrifices from attending social functions while memorizing her Tagalog lines in between filming sessions, she was able to ace her acting career. Marlene started out doing bit parts until she was cast in heavy supporting roles such as the black sheep sister of Paraluman in Anino ni Bathala in 1958, where she won her first the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) Award. With her newfound popularity and her recent FAMAS victory, she was then cast as the lead star in her first leading role in the movie Rosa Rossini. After Sampaguita Pictures declined in the 1960s, she became a freelance actress, giving her more freedom to choose more challenging dramatic roles and winning awards in the process. Marlene will forever be remembered in Philippine film history as the first Filipina thespian ever to win five acting awards from the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS), which was the only film award-giving body in the Philippines during her time. She won Best Supporting Actress for her roles in the films Anino ni Bathala, Kamandag, and Sapagkat Kami'y Tao Lamang. She also won two Best Actress awards for the films Sa Bawat Pintig ng Puso and Kapag Puso'y Sinugatan. She was also nominated by the FAMAS for an additional time: Best Actress for Mila Rosa, which she won. She was nominated for Best Actress in Alipin ng Busabos and Babae, Ikaw ang Dahilan, which she won again. Marlene made her last film in 1978 entitled Kung Kaya Mo, Kaya Ko Rin with Christopher de Leon, after which she went home to the United States. She also appeared in Combat Killers with Leopoldo Salcedo and the film was released as a class B movie in the United States. She is currently married to former De La Salle Green Archer basketball star Ernesto \\"Nonggoy\\" Hernaez, with whom she has three children. They now reside in California. Her granddaughter Ciera Mertens is a former beauty queen.

Fernandez was a two-time CFL All-Star (1984-1985) and is a member of the BC Lions Wall of Fame. In 2003, Fernandez was voted a member of the BC Lions All- Time Dream Team, at the wide receiver position, as part of the club's 50-year anniversary celebration. In 2006, Fernandez was voted one of the CFL's Top 50 players (#42) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. High school & college career Fernandez was a standout wide receiver for Andrew Hill High School in San Jose, California, where he picked up his famous nickname \\"Swervin' Mervyn\\" from the team's quarterback. Following high school, Fernandez played at DeAnza Junior College in Cupertino, California, before finishing his college career at nearby San Jos√© State University. It was at San Jos√© State that the Los Angeles Raiders staff members took notice of the 6‚Ä≤3‚Ä≥, 205 pound, speedy wide receiver, and the Raiders eventually made Fernandez their 10th round pick in the 1983 NFL Draft. Canadian Football League career Fernandez spent his entire six-year CFL career (1982-1986, 1994) with the BC Lions. Fernandez joined the Lions in 1982, and made an immediate impact, finishing his rookie season with over 1,000 receiving yards (1,046), and helping his team to 9‚Äì7 record. Fernandez won the CFL Western Division Most Outstanding Rookie award, and was a finalist for the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie award as well. After two 1,000-yard seasons, Fernandez was a key component in the BC Lions Grey Cup championship season of 1985. Fernandez finished the season with 95 catches and 1,727 yards for an 18.2 yards per reception average, along with 15 touchdowns. Despite being injured and not playing in the game, following the Lions' 37‚Äì24 triumph over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 73rd Grey Cup, Fernandez became the first Lion to win the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. Fernandez, a two-time CFL All- Star (1984-1985) and member of the BC Lions Wall of Fame, was finally persuaded by Al Davis and the Raiders to head south and join the NFL, following the 1986 CFL season. In 2003, Fernandez was voted a member of the BC Lions All-Time Dream Team, at the wide receiver position, as part of the club's 50-year anniversary celebration. In November 2006, Fernandez was voted one of the CFL's top 50 players (#42) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN. National Football League career Fernandez spent his entire 6-year NFL career (1987-1992) with one team: the Los Angeles Raiders. During that span, Fernandez played in 86 games and amassed 209 catches for 3,764 yards and 19 touchdowns. While Fernandez never made the Pro Bowl, he did leave his mark on the Raiders‚Äô record books. His 209 career catches are 10th most by any receiver in Raiders‚Äô history. His 3,764 career receiving yards ranks him number 8 all-time. His 18.01 average yards per catch for his career is first among any receiver to wear the Raiders' Silver and Black. In 1988, Fernandez led NFL receivers in average yards per catch (26.0). Arguably, Fernandez's finest year was 1989, when he made 57 catches for 1,069 yards and 9 touchdowns, leading all Raiders‚Äô receivers in almost every major category, and becoming only the sixth Raider to gain over 1,000 receiving yards in a season. Post-football life Fernandez currently lives in Morgan Hill, California and works as a sales representative. He is also an avid sport fisherman.

He had a season-high tackle performance with four each vs. Maryland and Clemson. After Augustin's graduation, McGrew and Buster Davis battled to replace him as starting middle linebacker. McGrew played in all 12 games, and was seventh on the team in tackles with 44 on the season. He had eight tackles against North Carolina. Still a back-up to Davis in his senior year, McGrew finished the year with 54 tackles, which ranked first among players not in the regular starting lineup. In his final college career game, the Orange Bowl vs. Penn State, McGrew recorded a career-high 11 tackles (1.5 for loss).

The rivalry is one of the oldest in the nation, dating back to 1894 when the two universities' football teams first met. Although the college football game is the most popular rivalry, the two universities have Civil War games in every sport that both sponsor. There is also an academic rivalry between the schools on occasion, and competitions for community services such as blood drives take place often.

The intersection was originally constructed as a traffic circle in 1930 and reconstructed as a modern roundabout in 1993.  History  In 1930, German engineer Werner Ruchti was contracted to design the traffic circle, which was to be based on European models. Construction was expedited in order to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic that was expected with the 1932 Summer Olympics, held in Los Angeles, as many of the aquatic and rowing events were to be held in Long Beach. The Los Alamitos Traffic Circle was one of the first of its kind to be constructed in the United States, and prior to their truncation, was also an end point of US 6 (which connects Provincetown, Massachusetts some to the east) and US 91. = Reclassification = In 1993, the circle was converted from an old-style traffic circle to a modern roundabout by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). This was the first such conversion in the United States. Yield signs replaced Stop signs, giving drivers inside the circle the right of way, which increased traffic flow efficiency. PCH (the main thoroughfare) was given an additional entry lane at both north and south bound routes. Also added were widened feeder lanes, and dedicated lanes for traffic traveling only 90 of the 360 degrees of the circle - the equivalent of a right turn at a traditional American traffic light. After the conversion, both the total auto accident and the injury rate significantly dropped, making the circle one of the safest statistically in the nation. The aforementioned modifications ran a cost of $350,000. In 2020, lane controls and shoulder striping were added to the roundabout to change it from being unmarked inside the roundabout to a maximum two-lane roundabout with lane controls for entering and exiting the roundabout. The west side of the roundabout (adjacent to the eastbound entrance from and westbound exit to Pacific Coast Highway) was reduced to one lane inside the roundabout through the installation of asphalt truck apron at that section. The Los Alamitos Traffic Circle was very similar to the 1932 Garces Memorial Circle located in Bakersfield, though the Bakersfield circle has not undergone modernization to roundabout standards. = Present day = Today the circle handles over 60,000 vehicles a day, mostly commuters from Orange County in the south heading to jobs in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County. The roadway is now owned by the State of California but managed by the City of Long Beach in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The city provides landscaping and traffic code enforcement, while the state provides road maintenance. In addition to the main traffic circle, there is also an Outer Traffic Circle that is concentric with the main roundabout. The artery Atherton Street ends at the Outer Traffic Circle and does not continue toward the main roundabout See also * References * \\"Drivers experience fewer crashes at L.B.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Biography O'Doherty was born in Dublin on 7 September 1823, although other sources including the Dictionary of Australasian Biography indicate he was born in June 1824. Charles Gavan Duffy, in his My Life in Two Hemispheres, states that O'Doherty was still under age when he was arrested in July 1848; however, Gavan Duffy was writing 50 years later. O'Doherty received a good education and studied medicine, but before he was qualified, joined the Young Ireland party and in June 1848, together with Thomas Antisell and Richard D'Alton Williams, established The Irish Tribune. Only five editions were issued, the first being on 10 June 1848. On 10 July 1848, when the fifth edition was issued, O'Doherty was arrested and charged with treason-felony. At the first and second trials the juries disagreed, but at the third trial he was found guilty and sentenced to transportation for 10 years. O'Doherty arrived in Tasmania in November 1849, was at once released on parole to reside at Oatlands, and his professional services were utilised at St. Mary's Hospital, Hobart. The other Irish prisoners nicknamed him 'St Kevin'.(see, Christine Kinealy, 'Repeal and Revolution. 1848 in Ireland', Manchester, 2009)(see, Christine Kinealy, 'Repeal and Revolution. 1848 in Ireland', Manchester, 2009). In 1854 received a pardon with the condition that he must not reside in Great Britain or Ireland. He went to Paris and carried on his medical studies, making one secret visit to Ireland to marry Mary Eva Kelly, to whom he was affianced before leaving Ireland. He received an unconditional pardon in 1856, and completed his studies in Dublin, graduating FRCS in 1857. He practised in Dublin successfully, and in 1862 went to Brisbane, Australia and became well known as one of its leading physicians.M. Cusack, Kevin Izod O'Doherty and the Roman Catholic Bishops of Hobart and Brisbane, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 22 (2001), 59-70. Kevin Izod O'Doherty O'Doherty was elected a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1867, in 1872 was responsible for a health act being passed, and was also one of the early opponents of the traffic in kanakas. In 1877 he transferred to the Queensland Legislative Council, and in 1885 resigned as he intended to settle in Europe. In Ireland O'Doherty was cordially welcomed, and was returned unopposed as Irish Parliamentary Party MP for North MeathTHE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONSTITUENCIES BEGINNING WITH \\"M\\" -- Leigh Rayment's Peerage Page. Retrieved 21 February 2015. to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in the November 1885 general election; but finding the climate did not suit him he did not seek re-election in 1886, and returned to Brisbane in that year. He attempted to take up his medical practice again but was not successful, and he died in poor circumstances on 15 July 1905. His wife and a daughter survived him. A fund was raised by public subscription to provide for his widow, Mary Eva (1826‚Äì1910), a poet, who in her early days was well known as the author of Irish patriotic verse in The Nation under the soubriqet \\"Eva\\". In Australia she occasionally contributed to Queensland journals, and one of her poems is included in A Book of Queensland Verse. She died at Brisbane on 21 May 1910.

The game has a cast that includes celebrities such as Christopher Walken, Paul Giamatti, Karen Allen, Burgess Meredith (in his final performance before his death the following year) and John Rhys-Davies. It also featured the Blue √ñyster Cult song \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\". There is no definite canonical answer on who the villain of the game is, since this is decided by the game at random, out of four main characters. A limited number of the clues and puzzles, plus a single line of dialogue in the ending, change according to the villain's identity. In 1996 home ports for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation were announced, but both were eventually cancelled. Plot synopsis Ripper takes place in New York City in the year 2040. It opens with the investigation of the recent murder of Renee Stein, the third victim of a serial killer known as \\"The Ripper\\", largely out of the modus operandi similarity to Jack the Ripper. The player assumes the role of Jake Quinlan, a reporter for the Virtual Herald, whom The Ripper sends messages to detailing his murders (an act attributed to Jack the Ripper, although no letters have been proven to come from him). Along with the police (whose investigation is headed by Detective Vincent Magnotta), Quinlan is seeking The Ripper's true identity. After investigating Renee Stein's murder, Quinlan receives a message from The Ripper, who warns Quinlan that his girlfriend, Catherine Powell, will be the next victim, as she has gotten too close to discovering his identity. Quinlan manages to find Powell still alive, but in a coma \\"deeper than anyone thought possible.\\" Cybersurgeon Claire Burton at the Meta-Cognition Center of the Tribeca Center Hospital manages to retrieve a distorted image of Powell's attacker, but requires additional information from Quinlan to make it clearer. (This is also a reference to Jack the Ripper, as the police hypothesized that they might be able to get an image of the killer from the retinas of the victims.) He provides this through investigating into what Powell was on to in her investigation and homes in on three possible suspects for The Ripper's murders. In order to transmit this information into Powell's brain directly, he enlists the help of Joey Falconetti, a hacker who specializes in interfacing directly with the human brain. Quinlan's investigation leads him to discover that all of The Ripper's victims and all of those associated with the investigation of The Ripper (except Quinlan himself) were involved with an old gaming group known as the Web Runners, who played a game based on the Jack the Ripper mystery. The last session of this game somehow caused one of the players to die in real life. The player that died happened to be Catherine Powell's mother. Assistance from a pathologist named Vic Farley reveals that The Ripper's murders were done by placing a code into a victim's brain while in cyberspace that caused their internal body pressure to rise to a point of explosion, which Farley experiences immediately after providing his explanation. Quinlan also finds a cyberspace weapon developed by a murdered cyberarchitect named Hamilton Wofford, designed specifically to kill The Ripper inside a virtual recreation of the historic Whitechapel district of London, where the Jack the Ripper murders took place. After assembling the weapon and gathering the necessary protection from The Ripper's weapon, Quinlan enters cyberspace, kills The Ripper, and manages to escape the virtual Whitechapel in time to escape its destruction. The Ripper can be one of four possible suspects: Joey Falconetti, Claire Burton, Vincent Magnotta, or Catherine Powell. With each play-through, certain clues and actual identity of The Ripper vary, though the bulk of the story is unchanged, and clues indicating the guilt of all four suspects will appear regardless of who the killer is. For instance, Catherine Powell experiences mysterious surges in brain wave activity that coincide with all the Ripper's murders regardless of whether or not she actually is the Ripper, and no alternative explanation for these surges is provided. However, the changes in the game's story and puzzles are limited to the game's third act- after Farley's death. Cast * Christopher Walken as Detective Vince Magnotta; a violent police officer with a romantic interest in Clare Burton and a vendetta against Falconetti. When Catherine's mother died during their last Ripper game, Magnotta arrested Falconetti for the murder. Magnotta is convinced that Falconetti is the Ripper, but his obsession may simply be a ruse to cover the fact that Magnotta himself is the Ripper. Magnotta may also be eager to frame Falconetti as the Ripper so that he can collect a large bounty for solving the case. Over the course of the investigation, Magnotta becomes increasingly more hostile towards Quinlan, believing him to be the Ripper due to the circumstances of Quinlan's encounters with the Ripper and their victims. * Burgess Meredith as Hamilton Wofford / Covington Wofford; two brothers that live on the outskirts of New York City. Hamilton was a Cyber-Architect who built virtual worlds based on historic locations. Hamilton was hired by the Ripper to build a replica of Whitechapel. Hamilton is murdered prior to the start of the game, but Quinlan eventually finds an AI created by Hamilton that provides him with critical information. Covington- in his brother's absence- is a recluse and seems to have gradually lost his grip on sanity. * Karen Allen as Doctor Clare Burton; a brilliant, but seemingly cold and distant doctor that specializes in the human brain. Burton is the object of affection of both Magnotta and Falconetti, both of whom have made Burton's life chaotic. Burton arouses suspicion of being the Ripper when she appears to stall treating Catherine- the only surviving Ripper victim. It is later revealed that Burton invented the weapon that the Ripper uses in his murders. Burton claims that the weapon was stolen, but whether this is true depends on whether Burton is the Ripper or not. * David Patrick Kelly as Joey Falconetti; a brilliant, though seemingly violent and disturbed computer hacker. Falconetti immediately draws suspicion of being the Ripper with his fascination with knife collecting and his fascination with the Ripper himself. Falconetti was married to Clare Burton, but the two divorced after Magnotta arrested Falconetti. Joey now has a vendetta for Magnotta and Burton, though he still has feelings for the latter. * Scott Cohen as Jake Quinlan; an investigative reporter who is investigating and writing about the Ripper murders. Quinlan regularly receives letters and messages from the Ripper, and Quinlan is forced into chasing the Ripper when his assistant and lover- Catherine Powell- is attacked by the Ripper. Quinlan is not well versed in the workings of cyberspace; thus the player must learn how the technology of the game world works as Quinlan learns it himself. * Ossie Davis as Ben Dodds; the editor of the Virtual Herald whom Quinlan confides in. * John Rhys-Davies as Vigo Haman; a mobster that has valuable information regarding Clare Burton. * Tahnee Welch as Catherine Powell; Quinlan's co-worker and lover. Powell begins investigating the Ripper behind Quinlan's back, hoping to take the story and launch her own career as a reporter. Powell is comatose for most of the game, but it is discovered late in the game that her brain activity spikes each day that the Ripper kills; making Catherine a viable suspect. The suspicion that Catherine may be the Ripper is heightened when it's discovered that her mother was killed in the last Ripper Web Runners game, and Catherine was aware of this fact. * Jimmie Walker as Soap Beatty; a computer hacker who is one of Catherine's primary sources in her investigation of the Ripper. He gives the player much insight into the computer technology of the game. * Steven Randazzo as Sgt. Lou Brannon; a rare non-corrupt cop that gives the player information about Magnotta's suspicious activities. * Peter Boyden as Vic Farley; a friendly pathologist who is trying to figure out how the Ripper commits his murders. * Paul Giamatti as Doctor Bud Cable; a doctor tending to Catherine Powell who keeps the player up to date about Catherine's condition when Doctor Burton stalls treating her. * MacIntyre Dixon as Gambit Nelson; a cyberspace entrepreneur who gives the player critical information about Falconetti. * Lianna Pai as Kashi Yamamoto; A current Web Runner who gives the player information about the Runners' history. * David Thornton as Twig; an assistant that maintains Falconetti's computer hacking equipment. * Kira Arne as Vivien Santiago; the receptionist at the hospital who flirts with Quinlan and informs Quinlan of suspicious activities at the hospital. * William Seymour as Bob Eppels; a pathologist who replaces Farley after Farley is fired. Suspiciously, Eppels is seemingly under instruction not to give Quinlan any information, though he slips up and tells Quinlan secrets about the hospital. * Richard Bright as Dr. Karl Stasiak; a forensic photographer who is a trusted source of Quinlan's. Unfortunately Karl gets freaked out by the Ripper's attacks and leaves New York, depriving Quinlan of a trusted source in the police department. * Phyllis Bash as Prof. Lillian Bech; a Professor who sheds some light on Clare Burton's past. She first informs Quinlan of the Web Runners' existence. Development Though full motion video-based games (also called interactive movies) had already become a subject of ridicule by the time Ripper began development, considerable effort was focused on the game's full motion video sequences. Paying the game's slew of big-name actors cost nearly 25% of the game's entire budget, and Phil Parmet was brought on to direct the video segments. By late November 1995, its budget had reached roughly $4 million.https://archive.is/HgoEb Writer/lead designer F. J. Lennon commented, \\"The whole industry wants to crucify FMV, people claim FMV doesn't belong in game, but if it's done professionally, I think it can work.\\" The game engine was created from scratch, and was designed with the ability to change resolution between 640x480 and 320x200 on the fly. Ripper was launched in February 1996. Reception =Sales= For the launch of Ripper, Take 2 announced shipments of 160,000 copies to retailers during the game's debut week, and called it \\"our biggest game to date\\". According to Take 2, the game sold above 150,000 units by the end of October 1996 and earned 28.7% of all company revenue during that fiscal year, the total of which was $12.5 million. The company's income in that period was $349,074. Arinn Dembo of CNET Gamecenter wrote, \\"[S]low sales, unfortunately, quickly knocked [Ripper] off retail shelves.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/19970720002032/http://www.gamecenter.com:80/Features/Exclusives/Halloween/ss01g.html =Critical reviews= The game received an average score of 71.50% at GameRankings, based on an aggregate of 4 reviews. A reviewer for Next Generation commented, \\"One minute the game believes it's a graphic adventure, the next it's a movie, and the next it's a puzzle game. If any one of these aspects would be perfected, it could be a gamer's delight.

It has traditionally been described as \\"the oldest dated Hebrew Codex of the Bible which has come down to us\\", but modern research seems to indicate an 11th-century date rather than the 895 CE date written into its colophon. It contains the books of the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) and Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the book of the Twelve Minor Prophets). It comprises 575 pages including 13 carpet pages.The City and the Book I History According to its colophon, it was written complete with punctuation by Moses ben Asher in Tiberias \\"at the end of the year 827 after the destruction of the second temple\\" (this corresponds to the year 895 CE, during the reign of Al- Mu'tadid). It was given as a present to the Karaite community in Jerusalem, and taken as booty by the Crusaders in 1099. Later it was redeemed and came into the possession of the Karaite community in Cairo. When the Karaite Jews left Egypt they deposited the codex in 1983, in the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, with document to prove it, where it is kept in a secure room on the floor below the Hebrew Manuscript collection.column by Jerusalem Post columnist and editor J. Zel Lurie. The Codex was brought back to Jerusalem by a committee of six persons. Scientific evaluation Although according to its colophon the codex was written by a member of the Ben Asher family, Lazar Lipsch√ºtz and others observed that, within the masoretic tradition, Codex Cairensis seems to be closer to Ben Naphtali than to Ben Asher. While some scholars consider this to be an argument against its authenticity, Moshe Goshen-Gottstein assumed that Ben Naphtali stuck more faithfully to the system of Moses ben Asher than the latter's own son Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, who corrected the Aleppo Codex and added its punctuation. More recently, further doubts on its authenticity have been cast by radiocarbon dating and other scientific techniques. It was stated, after scientific investigation, that the scribe must have been a different person from the vocaliser, and the manuscript must be dated to the 11th century, not the 9th.The Hebrew University Bible Project: Ezekiel, p.xli, note 116: \\"It was recently proven that the scribe and the naqdan (vocaliser) of the Cairo Prophets codex cannot be identified as Moshe Ben-Asher, and cannot be dated to 895 but rather to the 11th century CE. Cf. M. Beit-Ari√© et al., Codices Hebraicis litteris exarati quo tempore scripti fuerint exhibentes (Monumenta palaeographica medii aevi. Series Hebraica; Paris/Jerusalem: Brepols, 1997) 25-29; D. Lyons, The Cumulative Masora: Text, Form and Transmission (Beer-Sheva: Ben-Gurion University Press, 1999 [4]-7 (Hebrew). Umberto Cassuto relied heavily on this codex when producing his edition of the Masoretic Text, which means that in the prophets his edition is closer to the ben Naphtali tradition than in the Torah or Writings. Between 1979 and 1992 an editio princeps of the codex (text and masorahs) was published by a team of Spanish scholars. See F.

The band themselves opened their shows claiming \\"we play pop\\", but others described their music as synthpop, EBM and electro-industrial. Advanced Art were one of the very few Finnish bands at the time to appear on MTV Europe. The band never toured extensively but concentrated on one-off performances, sometimes in unusual locations.  History  In 1985, Pasi Janhunen, Petri Huttunen, and Petja Valasvaara formed a music project named Authorized Version in Tampere, Finland. After producing a couple of demos, the band changed their name in 1988 to \\"Advanced Art\\" when it became apparent that local media could not spell the English name \\"Authorized Version\\" correctly. The band's early sound was decidedly synthpop in nature, but by the 90s the band honed a style of EBM that was characterized by fast sequences and \\"unpolished\\" percussion. The band brought on additional members during live shows for percussion using various metal objects specifically to achieve a \\"harsher\\" sound. After the band's demo and indie vinyl stage Poko Rekords signed Advanced Art in 1991. The collaboration resulted in two maxi singles and two albums. After the release of their second CD, Force, the band embarked on a limited promotional tour in Sweden. Prior to that tour the band had played more than 50 shows, but not as part of an organized tour. In 1995, VUZ Records released a retrospective compilation including early demo material alongside material from fellow Finnish band Two Witches. The band effectively ceased activity thereafter. In 2015, the band released a pair of anthologies: Darkhive - The Tape And Vinyl Years containing demo material from their pre-Poko Records releases as well as their first 12\\" \\"Scar\\", and a 2 CD set entitled Archive containing 37 live and demo tracks dating back as far as 1987.

Life and career Born into a working class household, he studied at the Danish Conservatory of Music.Cane, A. Thomas Jensen and the Nielsen tradition. Classical Recordings Quarterly. Autumn 2014, No 78, p12-18. Jensen led several Danish ensembles, including the Danish National Symphony Orchestra (from 1957) and the Aarhus Symphony Orchestra (then known as the Aarhus Civic Orchestra). In Aarhus he built the small orchestra up through broadcasts and tours within Denmark and later to Germany and the Netherlands. He also conducted the Tivoli Concert Hall Orchestra. Jensen is best remembered (with Erik Tuxen and Launy Gr√∏ndahl) as one of the pioneers of the music of Carl Nielsen. He studied cello at the Royal Danish Academy of Music, where his harmony teacher was Nielsen. As an orchestral cellist he took part in the first performances of Nielsen's 4th and 5th symphonies, and also sat in on many rehearsals of Nielsen. Nielsen's daughters held that Jensen was the conductor whose performances came closest to Nielsen's own. He also played in the orchestra when Sibelius conducted his own music in the Danish capital in 1924 and 1926. Jensen made his recording debut in 1937 with lighter music by Knud√•ge Riisager and the year later led Svendsen's Romance, with Carlo Andersen playing the solo violin part. From 1937 to 1943 Jensen recorded over 60 sides of music for HMV, Odeon and Tono. In Aarhus he recorded works by Kuhlau, Tarp, Elgar, Massenet, M√∏ller, Debussy, Tchaikovsky and Smetana. His first recordings of Nielsen date from 1941 (the Suite for String Orchestra) with the Helios overture and orchestral opera extracts in the following year. Many of Jensens classical pieces were inspired from the greats before him such as Mozart and his personal favourite, Ludwig von Beethoven. He received his vision for each piece through his many walks through nature and his travels throughout Europe. Once, he stated in a diary uncovered by close friends, he had gone to the Country of England in a date not written. He visited the town of Slough and said it was one of the most incredible and horrible experiences of his life. The chaos and Industriales of the town made it seem dirty and too fast-paced. He stated that he much rather enjoyed the quietness and tranquillity of Denmark. In his travels through Slough, he once said that he met the love of his life, or at least the kindest and most beautiful woman he had ever met, Alison Oxley. In 1952 he received the Ingenio et Arti award from Fredrik IX.List of recipients of Ingenio et Arti accessed 25 January 2015.

It finished filming in March 2006. It premiered at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival, and opened in limited release in the United States on February 8, 2008. The film is about a man who gets caught in the middle of a bank robbery, ending up in the vault with one of the robbers he then treats as a hostage. After grossing $1,006 in the domestic market, the film was released on DVD on September 2, 2008. The film makes many references to the famous British pop band Duran Duran.  Plot  As he tries to access an ATM to retrieve his last twenty bucks, Jason ‚ÄúJINX‚Äù Taylor runs into a snag ‚Äì the transaction fee will overdraw him, and he cannot get his money out of the bank. Jinx fumes about this and other hidden charges which complicate his life‚Ä¶as we realize that he is locked in a bank vault‚Ä¶with the beautiful but tied-up Jessica, her apparently a hostage. Jessica is kept gagged with tape on her mouth. But, as Jinx rails against corporations and how they stack the deck, we realize that the situation is very different from what it appears: in fact, it is Jessica, not Jinx, who is robbing the bank. She is aligned with Simon, who leads an armed team inside the branch. However, Jinx‚Äôs entry into the scenario upsets the heist, leading him and Jessica to be inadvertently locked inside the vault. In addition, Jinx has called the cops, who, led by Officer De Gepse, have surrounded the bank. Jinx makes contact with Simon by cell phone, and the situation becomes clearer, as he realizes Jessica has access to a special inside-the-vault computer and its codes‚Ä¶she and only she can open the vault door. Simon becomes increasingly upset when he is unable to strong-talk Jinx into getting the vault open (so the robbers can clear out the safe deposit boxes). And De Gepse is equally frustrated by the standoff, particularly when it is Jinx, not he, who seems to gain control over the situation. As things progress, Jinx realizes that he and Jessica actually think very much alike ‚Äì they both feel used ‚Äì and this new kinship leads them to plot an escape. A call comes in from Nick, the true mastermind of the robbery, and Jinx and Jessica realize that Nick needs them to issue a PIN for him to access funds which have been skimmed (from fees, of course) over the course of years. With Simon increasingly unstable, Jinx is able to manipulate both him and De Gepse while also making a deal with Nick to provide a PIN (controlled by Jinx and Jessica) to go with Nick‚Äôs account information. Jinx manages to talk both cops and robbers into letting Jessica and him out, as freed hostages, and in the ensuing chaos, they slip away, to meet Nick and escape with their cut of the cash‚Ä¶  Cast  * Nick Stahl as Jason Taylor, or Jinx, The Innocent Civilian. * Erika Christensen as Jessica, The Hostage. * Gavin Rossdale as Simon, The Leader of the Bank Robbers and the main antagonist of the film. * Terry Crews as Officer Degepse, in charge of the negotiations. * Leo Fitzpatrick as Gunman, a henchman. * Adriano Aragon as Officer Linstrom, Degepse's partner. * David Carradine as Nick, the mastermind and main villain of the film.

The story takes place in Bourke, and concerns the burial of an anonymous union labourer, who had drowned the previous day \\"while trying to swim some horses across a billabong of the Darling.\\" The narrator, possibly Lawson himself, examines the level of respect the Bushfolk have for the dead, supplementing the story with his trademark dry, sardonic humour. Plot summary The story opens with the unnamed narrator and his party, boating on the Darling River, coming across a young man on horseback driving some horses along the bank. The young man asks if the water is too deep to cross, to which a joker in the party replies that it is deep enough to drown him. The young man continues up the river. The following day, a funeral gathers at a corner pub, the deceased being the young horsemen encountered the previous day. The anonymous man is a union member, however, little more is known about him. Though the \\"defunct\\" is of a different religion to the majority of the town, they, nonetheless, organise a respectful burial as \\"unionism is stronger than creed.\\" \\"Drink, however, is stronger than unionism,\\" and, by the time the hearse passes by the pub, \\"more than two- thirds of the funeral were unable to follow.\\" The narrator and his party respectfully follow the dwindling funeral procession, observing the conflict between the Bushfolks' respect for the dead, and their own personal comfort. The burial itself is sombre, yet emotionless. Nobody actually knew the deceased, and so it is impossible to feel sad for him. It is heard that the young man's name is James Tyson, though this is \\"simply the name he went by.\\" The narrator does eventually hear the man's real name, but he has already forgotten it. Characters \\"The Union Buries Its Dead\\" dedicates very few words to describing any one character in detail; this effectively creates a sense of detachment from everyone, especially the deceased union member. *Narrator: **He respectfully follows the funeral procession, despite feeling no emotional attachment to the deceased. The narrator is often taken to be Lawson himself. *James Tyson: **The \\"defunct.\\" J.T. wasn't his real name- \\"only 'the name he went by.'\\" He was a 'Roman,' and a young union labourer, of about twenty-five years. He had drowned while trying to swim his horses across a billabong of the Darling River. The story was adapted for the first part of the trilogy film Three in One produced by Cecil Holmes and released in 1957. The screenplay by Rex Rienits is called Joe Wilson's Mates. No, the dead man was known by nobody in town, but here his only possession, a union membership card, shows his name. Support for unionism is depicted by an increasing number of town and farm folk falling in behind the hearse as it moves to the cemetery. Edmund Allison strongly plays a union loyalist who emerges as leader. Lawson's avoidance of stock conventions Lawson also takes time, nearing the end of the sketch, to draw attention to his own avoidance of the usual stock conventions. :\\"I have left out the wattle- because it wasn't there. I have also neglected to mention the heart-broken old mate, with his grizzled head bowed and great pearly drops streaming down his rugged cheeks. He was absent- he was probably 'Out Back.' For similar reasons I have omitted reference to the suspicious moisture in the eyes of a bearded bush ruffian named Bill. Bill failed to turn up, and the only moisture was that which was induced by the heat. I have left out the 'sad Australian sunset' because the sun was not going down at the time. The burial took place exactly at mid-day.\\" \\"The Union Buries Its Dead\\", The Country I Come From, Edinburgh and London, Blackwood, 1901 In many of his weaker stories, Lawson himself falls back upon the stock emotive devices he quite obviously disdained when he wrote this particular sketch. It is this attitude towards the romanticisation of Bushlife that ultimately lead to the Bulletin Debate, during which the two popular poets, Lawson and Andrew Barton \\"Banjo\\" Paterson engaged in verse controversy by publishing numerous poems in the weekly Bulletin in 1892-93. Factual basis of story In 1902 Lawson wrote: '\\"The Union Buries Its Dead\\" is simply an unornimented (sic) description of a funeral I took part in Bourk (sic) N.S.W.- it is true in every detail- even to the paragraph re the drowning of a man named Tyson having appeared in a Sydney Daily.'Letter to Edward Garnett, 27th (or 28th) Feb 1902The Penguin Henry Lawson Short Stories (First published 1986) Edited with an introduction by John Barnes - Introduction William Wood, writing from Paraguay in 1931, recalled knowing Lawson during his stay in Bourke: 'I was present, with other Union officials, at the funeral described by Henry in \\"The Union Buries Its Dead\\" and still remember many of the details so humorously described... The cemetery was a good step from town and many of the mourners developed a strong thirst long before the first pub was met on the way back.'.

He is also remembered as the lover of the English novelist Nancy Mitford, and appears in a fictionalised form in two of her novels. Biography Palewski was born in Paris into a Jewish family, the son of an industrialist Maurice Serge Mo√Øse Herch Palewski (b. 1867 in Kobry≈Ñ, then in Russian Empire, now in Belarus - d. 1938) and his wife Rose n√©e Diamant-Berger (b. 1869 in BuzƒÉu, Romania - d. 1954)(https://gw.geneanet.org/spalewski?lang=fr&pz;=stanislas+thibaut+marie+marcel&nz;=palewski&ocz;=0&p;=maurice+serge+moise+herch&n;=palewski)http://old.palevsky.org/trees/pa.html. Gaston Palewski was educated at the Sorbonne, at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques and at Oxford University‚Äîhe spoke excellent English and was a convinced Anglophile. Using family connections, he obtained a post with Marshal Hubert Lyautey, the French Resident-General in Morocco. In 1928 he became principal private secretary to Paul Reynaud, a leading politician who was then Minister for Finances and who became Prime Minister of France in March 1940. Through Reynaud, in 1934, he first met Charles de Gaulle, and became a supporter of his political and military views. On the outbreak of war in 1939 Palewski was commissioned as a lieutenant in the French Air Force, and saw action following the German invasion of France in May 1940. He was in French North Africa at the time of the armistice of June 1940. Refusing to accept France's defeat, he reached London at the end of August and joined de Gaulle's Free French Forces. De Gaulle appointed him Director of Political Affairs of the Free French movement, and he played a leading role in negotiations between de Gaulle and the British government, which at first regarded de Gaulle with scepticism. In March 1941 he was given the rank of lieutenant-colonel and command of the Free French Army in East Africa, leading it against the Italian forces during the recapture of French Somaliland (now Djibouti). In September 1942, he was recalled to London to become de Gaulle's Directeur du Cabinet, a post in which he followed de Gaulle from London to Algiers in 1943 and then in August 1944 to liberated Paris. He became known as de Gaulle's homme de confiance (right-hand man), and his diplomatic skills and knowledge of the British made him invaluable to de Gaulle, who neither understood the British nor trusted them.Selina Hastings, Nancy Mitford (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1985) chap. 7. Palewski remained director of de Gaulle's cabinet (that is, his private office) until de Gaulle's resignation as head of the Provisional Government in January 1946. He then became a leading proponent of Gaullism and one of the founders of the first Gaullist party, the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran√ßais (Rally of the French People, or RPF) in 1947. In 1951 he was elected to the National Assembly as an RPF deputy for the Department of the Seine (Paris). From 1953 to 1955 he was vice- president of the National Assembly. Following the failure of the RPF, however, he withdrew from politics. In 1957, at de Gaulle's request, he was appointed Ambassador to Italy, a post he held until 1962. In 1962 Palewski was appointed by Prime Minister Georges Pompidou as Minister of State in charge of Scientific Research, Atomic Energy and Space Questions, the first French minister with specific responsibility for such matters. On 1 May 1962 Palewski witnessed the French underground nuclear test codenamed \\"Beryl\\" in Algeria. The test shaft failed to contain the blast and he was exposed to radiation as result of a leak of radioactive lava and dust into the atmosphere. He believed that the leukemia which he contracted later in life was caused by this accident.http://www.lefigaro.fr/sciences/20070320.FIG000000056_le_bilan_des_essais_nucleaires_francais_en_algerie.html From 1965 to 1974 he was President of the Constitutional Council of France. Palewski died of leukemia in 1984, aged 83. Decorations and honorary positions Palewski's decorations. The Compagnon de la Lib√©ration, Croix de Guerre with star, Croix du combattant volontaire, M√©daille Coloniale with bar \\"√âthiopie\\" and the stars of the two grand-crosses After 1974 he held a number of honorary posts. An amateur painter of some talent, he was a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. Because of his high office and his record in the war Palewski was awarded several French decorations. After his term as an ambassador to the Italian government, not to the Holy See, he was awarded an Italian Grand Cross. *The Grand Croix of the L√©gion d'Honneur, *The title and cross of a Compagnon de la Lib√©ration, *The Croix de Guerre (twice), *The M√©daille Coloniale, with a bar *The Croix du combattant volontaire 1939‚Äì1945. *The Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic Character In his personal life, Palewski was a notorious and reckless womaniser, and this earned him a reputation for frivolity that damaged his prospects for a serious political career. Only his standing with de Gaulle, to whom he was devoted and totally loyal, enabled him to hold high office. During the war in London he met the English writer and society figure Nancy Mitford, and began with her a long, passionate but intermittent affair. They were separated during the latter part of the war, but in 1946 she moved permanently to Paris, and their relationship, though never public, lasted until her death in 1973. This did not prevent him becoming involved with many other women. In 1969, without formally ending his affair with Mitford‚Äîhe was with her when she died‚Äîhe married Helen-Violette de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (1915‚Äì2003), duchesse de Sagan, the daughter of the seventh duc de Talleyrand and his wife Anna Gould. The two had been having a long affair prior to the duchess's divorce from her first husband and had had a son out of wedlock. In the English-speaking world Palewski is known chiefly through his appearance as Fabrice, duc de Sauveterre, in two of Nancy Mitford's novels, The Pursuit of Love (1945) and Love in a Cold Climate (1949). The first of these contains a fairly accurate portrayal of their relationship, although it is moved from postwar to prewar Paris. Despite Mitford's love for Palewski, she depicted him in a very clear- eyed way in these novels, with no attempt to disguise his many infidelities. He took no offence at this, and when Mitford proposed to dedicate The Pursuit of Love to \\"The Colonel\\", he insisted on his real name being used.

It was broadcast on the Free FM brand radio stations (usually) live, with theme music by Mike Jones.  Format  The show dealt with topics in the news regarding science, skepticism, religion, entertainment and politics. Jillette promoted his libertarian and atheist perspectives from the \\"nut point of view\\" to encourage listeners to call and email with their stories and opinions about the topic. Early shows tended to be without structure, with Jillette and Goudeau talking about whatever came to mind, taking the occasional caller and reading the occasional email. Later shows had tended to formalize around a current topic and a call- in talk show format. Jillette and Goudeau would usually broadcast from Jillette's Vegas area home (\\"The Slammer\\"). The broadcast was done from Jillette's personal recording studio, Vintage Nudes Studio. Celebrity guests, usually friends of Penn, often featured on the show. Guests included Criss Angel, James Randi (often with Paul Provenza), Mac King, Gilbert Gottfried, Trey Parker, Joe Rogan, Dennis Miller, Lisa Lampanelli, and Lawrence O'Donnell (nicknamed L.O.D. by Jillette). Penn Radio was well known for its special feature \\"Monkey Tuesday\\", which was discontinued in January 2007 (soon superseded by \\"Pull of the Weasel Friday\\"). = Regular features = Monkey Tuesday: Hosts Penn Jillette and Michael Goudeau read emails and took calls from listeners with stories about chimpanzees, orangutans and other primates, yet because monkey is a \\"funnier\\" word, all were referred to as monkeys. Monkey Tuesday originated when Penn told a story of a party held at his house where he had invited Tarzan, a performing chimpanzee and Arturo, a dwarf, forgetting that chimpanzees fight for dominance with people of small stature. Goudeau had expressed surprise at Penn's naivety. \\"I thought you were circus,\\" he criticized, informing Penn regarding the dangers of having both a dwarf and a chimp at the same party. After phoning Arturo to uninvite him but not having the heart to follow through, Penn worked out a compromise: Tarzan and Arturo could both be at the party as long as they were in separate rooms. As an added measure of security, Penn and a posse of trusted party attendees armed themselves with knives. However, Tarzan and Arturo met poolside and predictably, Tarzan charged Arturo. Rather than jump into the swimming pool as planned as chimps hate water (Chimps, lacking buoyant body fat, sink like rocks in water), Arturo \\"hauled ass\\" into Penn's house. Tarzan pursued Arturo but got distracted by the other guests. The guests shuttled the chimp into various rooms to allow Arturo to move around, and later found Arturo a tall bar stool to stand on. Tarzan, confused, decided not to challenge. On April 18, 2006, the first show where the phrase Monkey Tuesday was used, Penn read an email from a fan describing a childhood trip through a wildlife park where the fan and his brothers fed monkeys Certs through a car window. When the Certs ran out, the monkeys reached into the car and grabbed his brother. His mother sped up in an attempt to shake off the monkeys while at the same time his grandmother rolled up the back window, trapping the monkeys' hands. The window was lowered with the car still traveling at high speed, causing the monkeys to fall off the car and spit out mouthfuls of Certs as they hit the ground. The tradition continued on May 9 when Penn read several letters and listeners called in with amusing monkey stories. There were enough monkey- related stories from listeners that one show a week could be devoted to them. Since both of the original stories were told on a Tuesday, Penn quipped they had inadvertently invented \\"Monkey Tuesday\\". The name and day stuck. Layperson Penn: Penn Radio had occasional days called \\"Ask Layperson Penn\\" where Jillette and Goudeau provided advice and answers on any topic to callers, although the hosts constantly reiterated their complete lack of qualification and title. This feature was partially a jab at radio hosts such as Laura Schlessinger (who offers psychological advice as \\"Dr. Laura\\" though her doctorate is actually in physiology, not psychology) who give advice on topics outside their range of expertise. However callers were instructed by the call screener to address Jillette as Doctor Penn, and were invariably corrected by Jillette. In one show Patrick can be heard yelling into the studio \\"it's Doctor Penn!\\" At times, when Penn and Goudeau needed a pre-recorded show to cover a vacation day, they would record an extended \\"Ask Layperson Penn\\" off air for later broadcast. Libel Wednesday: On Wednesday, November 8, 2006 Penn asked listeners to call in and tell their \\"swear-to-god true stories\\" about their experiences hanging out with former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. After stressing to his listeners that their stories must be true, Penn and Goudeau proceeded to tell wildly fictional accounts of times they had spent with \\"Rummy\\" and listeners understood the cue to do the same. On the January 10, 2007 episode (also a Wednesday), Penn asked that anybody with advance knowledge of the 2007 State of the Union Address President Bush was to give that night to call in and let them know what it will contain, again stressing that the information must be true. Listeners called in and gave their own fabricated accounts of what would be in Bush's speech. The term \\"Libel Wednesday\\" was coined in an email by frequent emailer Christian (the Skeptical Atheist) and was an occasional feature on the show. Pull of the Weasel Friday: The February 2, 2007 show featured a new Friday segment called \\"Pull of the Weasel\\". Listeners called or emailed Penn and Goudeau with stories where they successfully or unsuccessfully fought the \\"pull of the weasel\\". Penn describes the pull of the weasel as \\"You know something is wrong, but somewhere in your gut a little weasel is telling you to do it.\\" The term came from the January 29, 2007 episode where Penn commented that his wife sometimes succumbs to the \\"pull of the weasel\\" and claims high value items in the lost and found that are not technically hers. On the January 29 show, Goudeau mistakenly referred to it as the \\"call of the weasel\\" and this seems to have become an alternative term/title, especially among the show's Goudeau- sympathizing faction. = Repeats = Penn and Goudeau turned down offers by CBS to run repeats to cover their vacation days. Typically Penn tried to do a remote broadcast if he was away from Las Vegas on business. Alternatively, Penn and Goudeau prerecorded interviews with comics headlining in Vegas and did extended \\"Lay Person Penns\\" for later broadcast. = Contests = *John Lennon Seance Contest: Penn preferred if listeners did not watch the pay-per- view John Lennon s√©ance which aired April 2006. However he recognized this event would probably attract many viewers who simply wanted to jeer at the broadcast. To prevent this money from going to unscrupulous s√©ance promoters, Penn had a contest wherein one listener would watch the show for the rest of the Penn Radio audience and then give a report. To be considered as a candidate, one had to be in Las Vegas when the TV show was airing, had to be a fan of The Beatles, had to have a knowledge of skepticism and parapsychology, and, most importantly, had to have a shapely buttocks that qualified as a \\"honky tonk badonkadonk\\". Many candidates with extensive knowledge of the Fab Four and parapsychology were, by their own admission, flat-assed and thereby disqualified themselves. Eventually Penn picked listener Garrett from San Diego to watch the John Lennon s√©ance and recount the program on the April 25, 2006 radio show. Garrett's bid avoided any mention of his posterior but played up his ability to make light of the seance in song. For his efforts, Garrett was given a tour of Jillette's home, tickets to both the Penn and Teller and Lance Burton Vegas shows, $20 in gambling money, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts. *Penn's 24 Marathon: Penn offered to let a listener join him and his friends at The Slammer for a marathon viewing of the fifth season of the TV show 24. Listeners had to write in and explain why they should be allowed into Penn's home and watch the show with him and his friends. Out of fear the guest would ruin the show's many suspenseful moments, candidates had to swear they had not actually watched any part of season five during its broadcast run. Unfortunately, Penn announced on the November 10, 2006 show that the contest was canceled when \\"the party fell apart\\" and a new financially lucrative network TV project (later revealed to be hosting the game show Identity) required Penn's attention. Two candidates in the running were an FBI agent and a Canadian who submitted his bid in verse accompanied by piano (\\"Penn Jillette won't you let me / watch 24 with you / Mike Goudeau don't you know / how much I love that show\\").  Memorable Penn Radio moments  *Penn recounting the story of inviting a Chimpanzee and a dwarf to the same party, and the creation of Monkey Tuesday. *Penn being called away from the May 22, 2006 show because his wife was going into labor with their second child (Zolten Penn), and continuing the rest of the show from his cell phone while in traffic. *Penn claiming Mother Teresa had a sexual kink for death and suffering. KIFR radio personality John London, whose show followed Penn Radio, offered to pay a listener to murder Penn. He was fired by CBS Radio CEO Joel Hollander after making on-air prank calls to Penn Jillette and Hollander. This, and other legal complications, were never discussed on Penn Radio. Fans have commented on the similarities between this chain of events and the storyline to Penn and Teller's 1989 movie, Penn & Teller Get Killed. *During Lent, Penn requested his listeners go to McDonald's restaurants on Friday morning and purchase all the Filet-O-Fish sandwiches, thus forcing Catholic families with screaming children to eat beef. Penn hoped that the children would realize that eating meat would not send them to hell. More than a few involved with the show got sick after eating those fish filets. * Comedians from The Aristocrats who have been guests on Penn Radio: Lewis Black, David Brenner, Drew Carey, Carrot Top, Phyllis Diller, Judy Gold, Gilbert Gottfried, Lisa Lampanelli, Wendy Liebman, Howie Mandel (set a record for use of the c word), Merrill Markoe, Jackie Martling, Trey Parker, Matt Stone, The Passing Zone, Kevin Pollak, Paul Provenza, Bob Saget, Bobby Slayton, Doug Stanhope, and Fred Willard. *Penn interviewing his hero Norman Borlaug on August 9, 2006. *A September 11 anniversary episode conducted in a somber fashion without Michael Goudeau. *The October 18, 2006 show featured the first time Penn ever purposely hung up on a caller. Penn asked caller Mike (not to be confused with regular caller President Mike) to demonstrate his Spanish fluency. After a very hesitant start, Mike began speaking in Spanish only to have Penn dump his call after a few words. The hang up was meant only as a joke on Penn's part and not intended to be rude to Mike. On January 16, 2007, Penn hung up on Bill, who was attempting to abide by the topic of \\"mandatory false dichotomies\\" by stating that \\"Monkeys are just not funny, man.\\" During a later show Bill called in to complain about a radio show that dumped his call. Penn and Goudeau incorrectly claimed on air that Bill was the first person Penn had ever hung up on. *On the December 19, 2006 show while Goudeau was on a ski vacation, Penn revealed on air the password to their Gmail account (dawkins) and followed this with \\"Goudeau uses that password for everything.\\" Later in the day, Penn found out that fans of the shows had logged on and started getting e-mail addresses from the account. Before much damage was done, one teenage fan stepped up, changed the password, and then got in touch with Penn, thus saving the day. The teen suggested, with no sarcasm, that the new password should not be borlaug. *On the January 3, 2007 show (the show's one- year anniversary) Penn, as promised, told his \\"Blow-Dryer Story\\". This involved Penn burning his penis (Penn uses the euphemism Little Houdini throughout) on a blow dryer element during an attempt to win back an ex- girlfriend. The show featured a live audience which included Mike Jones. Penn first mentioned the \\"Blow-Dryer Story\\" on the January 27, 2006 broadcast. *On the January 4, 2007 show Goudeau treated a deep cut to Penn's left thumb (caused the evening before while Penn was juggling broken bottles on-stage at the Rio), trying twice to cover the v-shaped injury with a Krazy Glue pen. This happened live on air with callers phoning in advice. *Penn-brand Viagra: on the February 1, 2007 show, a listener alerted Penn to a strange photo of him gracing the cover of a Chinese herbal \\"Viagra\\". The Chinese box copy claims the box contains fast acting pills that will increase a man's stamina, increase the volume of his semen, and win him respect among other men. The box depicts an illustration of a man that looks disquietingly like Penn Jillette (complete with his signature one painted fingernail) choking a woman during intercourse. The product does not identify Penn by name but seems to label him as the \\"impetuous man\\". It was later revealed the art work was of Penn. The artwork accompanied an interview with Penn in an American magazine. It is unknown how the art made its way to Asia. *Two full episodes on February 5 and February 23, 2007 devoted to a debate between comedian Joe Rogan and Phil Plait of BadAstronomy.com about moon landing conspiracies. *Penn Jillette announced on March 2, 2007 that the show would be his last on Free FM. He said multiple times that he will be back elsewhere.  Themes  = Penn utterances = * For a time Penn would wish Lance Burton a good morning and Goudeau would wish Teller a good morning. Both Burton and Teller, late risers, claimed one day they would set their alarm clocks and listen to the radio show. *Penn usually answered \\"How are you?\\" with \\"Never better, boss.\\" Callers were not encouraged to echo this line back at him. *When referring to his Showtime show Bullshit!, Penn got around the censors by saying \\"Bulls (hand clap) hit\\". He started doing this (without the hand clap) on the February 13, 2006 show. Previous to the February 13 show, Penn would refer to the show as \\"Bull shot\\". The January 30, 2006 show a caller suggested \\"Bull's Stuff\\", which Penn used before \\"Bulls hit\\". Penn got the idea of parsing the show as \\"bulls hit\\" when he noticed iCal (a Mac calendar program) hyphenated \\"bullshit\\" as \\"bulls-hit\\". The hand clap between \\"bulls\\" and \\"hit\\" was first added during the tail end of the April 3, 2006 show. Penn did frequently tip his magician's top hat to Criss Angel for calling his A&E; show Mindfreak, knowing everyone understands the show name to mean \\"mind fuck\\". * Penn said \\"Mother Hubbard\\" as a substitute for motherfucker. He usually used it to stress something was happening to a great degree. \\"The engine was running like a Mother Hubbard.\\" * Penn made frequent references to his Newfoundland heritage (his mother and father were from Newfoundland). He used the term \\"maggoty\\" a lot to imply an excess of something. He picked this phrase up while vacationing in Newfoundland. A pair of Newfoundland TV show hosts described Penn & Teller as being \\"maggoty with magic tricks\\". Previous to the March 28, 2006 show, he would use the term lousy to imply an excess. *Whenever Penn mentioned Howard Stern, he would burp and ask, \\"What's in the news, Robin?\\", a homage to The Howard Stern Show. *Part of the May 9, 2006 radio show was cut after a caller began to tell a story of visiting a zoo and seeing an orangutan masturbating while watching a good looking female schoolteacher. The young man remarked to his father \\"You know, they're so much like us!!\\", a line which Penn and Goudeau would quote in later shows as \\"Pops, they're so much like us!\\" Penn subsequently described this story as \\"probably the best story in the history of mankind\\" and promised a rebroadcast. * Penn used Lisa Lampanelli terms Slurpee Indian to refer to Indians from South Asia and Casino Indian to refer to American Indians. * Sometimes Penn referred to something, usually a sexual kink, as being a \\"woman puking on a monkey\\" case. The phrase was coined during the September 19, 2006 Monkey Tuesday show, regarding an attractive blond woman who accidentally vomited on a baby monkey. During the September 22, 2006 show, listener Steve submitted to Penn and Goudeau a Photoshop creation of a woman throwing up on a primate. Penn's exclamation \\"Jesus Christ puking on a monkey!\\" also takes the September 19 show as the phrase's origin. * When Penn did not care about something or an issue, he would say \\"I don't give a good goddamn.\\" He noted that he abides by CBS's obscenity policy but did not necessarily follow CBS's blasphemy policy. * When Penn thought someone was holding out on him or trying to dupe him in some way, he called the person \\"you rat bastard\\" in a slow, methodical manner. * When Penn wanted to stress a very large number he sometimes said \\"Sagan billions\\", implying the figure is into the \\"billions and billions\\". The reference was to Carl Sagan who had a unique way of saying \\"billions\\". Johnny Carson popularized the idea Sagan would say \\"billions and billions\\" frequently, although there is no record of Sagan ever using the exact \\"billions and billions\\" phrase. * Monkey C: On the January 10, 2007 episode, Penn asked for listeners who had worked on the Bush speech about his new plan for Iraq to call or email in and reveal the speech's contents. One listener claimed she had proofread the speech and part of Bush's plan was to send three monkey troops to Iraq. One group called \\"Monkey C\\" was the most elite. Its motto was \\"Monkey C, monkey do!\\" Penn found this play on words very funny and made several follow-on references to it. = Show closers = At the end of each show, Penn often recited some recurring phrases. These included: * \\"It frightens me the awful truth of how sweet life can be.\\" This is a line from the Bob Dylan song \\"Up to Me\\", a previously unreleased outtake from the 1974 album Blood on the Tracks which can be found on his 1985 album Biograph. * \\"We'll be back tomorrow if the creek don't rise.\\" * \\"I'd chime in with a 'Haven't you people ever heard of closing the god damn door?!'\\" presumably from Panic! At The Disco's \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" for several shows. = Media and music references = * Penn made frequent references to Elvis Presley, often using the phrase \\"Elvis didn't do no drugs!\\" Penn believed Elvis did not know a lot but he knew how to eat. * Bad grammar in song lyrics enraged Penn. \\"Live and Let Die\\" and the theme from \\"Shaft\\" were examples Penn used a lot, through \\"Frosty the Snowman\\" once provoked a memorable discussion between Penn and Goudeau: \\"There must have been some magic / In that old silk hat they found\\". Also Penn seems disturbed by the lyrics to the Wayne Newton standard \\"Danke Schoen\\". \\"I recall / Central Park in fall / how you tore your dress / what a mess / I confess / that's not all\\" sounds to Penn like a celebration of date rape, mostly due to his mis-remembering part of the line into \\"how I tore your dress.\\" * Oft-mentioned Penn and Goudeau heroes: Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the creators of South Park), Richard Dawkins, and Norman Borlaug. * Penn made frequent references to his favorite novel Moby- Dick. * Penn had a pretend feud with the guys from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. Bullshit! and the Queer Eye show were both nominated in the same categories for various TV award shows. Queer Eye typically won over Bullshit!. * Penn thought Ron Jeremy is living the American dream: He's an unattractive man getting paid to have sex. * Penn frequently expressed his like for Bob Dylan and Lou Reed. Penn thought it was very cool Dylan kept his Oscar statue on his amp and had said, \\"I won't let anyone bring alcohol into my house unless they're as cool as Lou Reed.\\" * Penn does not like the work of Michael Moore, but loves the fact that his films are shown and not censored. * If anyone mentioned the Ringling Brothers circus, Penn reflexively corrected them by saying \\"Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey The Greatest Show On Earth!\\" During his time at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College, he was taught never to shorten the name of the circus or even refer to it by a pronoun. You were, at all times, to refer to the circus by its full and complete name. * Odd phrases caused Penn to interrupt and note the odd phrase would make an excellent band name or album title. \\"Asian Earwax? That's an excellent name for a band.\\" * Penn made a lot of fun about Goudeau's poor knowledge of popular music and jazz. Goudeau compared any piece of jazz music to Vince Guaraldi. Penn explained his irritation stems from him growing up in a very musical household while Goudeau's family did not even own a radio until he was older. He referred to a fast-tempo section of Mike Jones's Pull of the Weasel theme as \\"jumpy\\". * Regarding the notion all publicity is ultimately good publicity, Penn would jokingly ascribe that quote to Lee Harvey Oswald. * Goudeau sometimes referred to circular reasoning as a \\"robot killer\\", in reference to a couple of episodes of Star Trek where Kirk talks a robot or computer into self-destructing by positing it a self-contradicting proposition. Goudeau claims that this idea was originally Dean Cameron's. = Penn and Penn Radio philosophy = * Penn liked to refer to his view point as \\"the nut point of view\\". * Penn stated interest in starting a \\"bacon and a kiss\\" airline. He theorized that you can avoid invasive airport security by requiring eating bacon and kissing someone of the same gender on the genitals, and therefore screening out religious fundamentalists. Apart from those restrictions, you can carry anything you feel like onto the plane without any other security checks. Penn has also added that another way to weed out fundamentalist Muslims was to have them pray to another deity, or to draw a picture and label it Mohammad. * Penn and Goudeau believed their listeners were a) the most intellectual audience in morning radio, and b) kind enough to hang up after they've stated their piece. In fact, many times callers would say \\"goodbye\\" and hang up before Penn was finished talking to them. * During the \\"Ask Layperson Penn\\" shows, callers usually addressed Penn as \\"Doctor Penn\\", (at the behest of the call screener) to which Penn responded \\"it's actually layperson Penn\\". * Penn often made the point that you can break the rules of an organization you do not belong to. Non-freemason members are not allowed to wear the Mason ring according to the Masonic rules, but these rules do not apply to non-Masons so they can wear the ring anyway. = Penn Radio politics = * Penn did not generally view hypocrisy as a problem. If a person was saying one thing and doing another, Penn believed he would at least agree with either what the person was saying or with what the person was doing. * Penn referred to the Democrats and Republicans as the Crips and the Bloods. * Penn had a theory that all laws should have a one-year expiration date and have to be re-passed every year. This will ensure politicians only re-pass the really important laws. = Personal Penn references = * Penn claimed that any role that required him to do more than getting shot in the face was a stretch for his acting talents. Many of his earlier acting jobs in TV seemed to be as an extra who gets shot in the head. * A New York Times article by Alex Williams accused Penn's child Moxie CrimeFighter of having the worst celebrity baby name. Penn believed names like David and Alex were for losers. A seemingly high proportion of Penn Radio show callers and e-mail writers were named Dave or David. * Penn made the occasional reference to Magic and Mystery Tour, a Canadian CBC documentary he and Teller made on magic in China, India, and Egypt. Penn usually did not have very pleasant things to say about his travels in China, et al., or the Canadian crew he worked with. * Penn would note frequently he is not an educated man. He \\"got out of high school on a plea bargain\\". * When the subject of luck came up, Penn would sometimes refer to a famous quote that frequently gets mis-attributed to him: \\"Luck is probability taken personally\\". The quote is properly attributed to Chip Denman (manager of the Statistics Laboratory at the University of Maryland). = On religion = * Penn frequently referenced the Scientology \\"devil\\", Xenu, usually as a substitute for the word god (e.g., \\"hail Xenu\\"). * Penn liked to argue that most religious advocacy groups, like the Catholic League for Decency, amounted to one loud guy working out of his house. Penn argued a religion like Catholicism already has an official spokesperson ‚Äì the Pope. * Penn did not usually have a personal problem with religious people. Many come up to him after his show and he felt they have congenial conversations. He did mention, however, he was struck once by a drunk Christian woman. The woman told Penn her pastor said there are no such thing as atheists, to which Penn responded, \\"That's two things your pastor is wrong about.\\" The woman proceeded to slap Penn. * Penn dubbed Ash Wednesday as Chiquita Banana Wednesday. He encouraged listeners to wear a banana sticker on their forehead instead of a palm ash cross. = On magic and juggling = * Penn and Goudeau usually claimed the only thing they really knew and understood is juggling. * Penn noted that good magicians and jugglers get to where they are because they literally practice the basic moves of their craft 12 hours a day, every day, in their bedroom. = Recurring goofs = * The show's phone operators were instructed that when Penn said \\"Thanks for calling\\", that was their cue to hang up on the caller. More often than not, Penn had a follow-up question for the caller only to find out the caller has been dumped. After the phone lines were placed in his home (no longer redirected from the New York call center), Penn acquired the ability to hang up the phones himself and often still used the code phrase while he did it. The use of this code phrase was mentioned twice by Penn on the June 12, 2006 show, a couple of times by Goudeau on the July 11, 2006 Monkey Tuesday and a few more times on the August 21, 2006 show, \\"Does Anybody Watch Award Shows? (featuring Kathy Griffin's brother (Twice)\\". * During a segment known as \\"Ask Layperson Penn\\" where callers can ask for advice or an opinion on anything, callers would address Penn as \\"Dr. Penn,\\" which Penn would insist it's \\"actually layperson Penn.\\" * When a caller or guest was telling a particularly funny story, Penn urged the story teller, in a phone sex voice, \\"tell it slow\\". This sometimes backfired as they ran out of time before the story actually was finished. * When a caller mentioned a URL, Penn sometimes shouted at the listener if he or she used \\"www\\". Penn noted, forcefully, that everyone knows that it's the World Wide Web, despite not all websites starting with www. * Sometimes Penn got the sex of the caller incorrect based on the name. When this happened Penn apologized and noted that for much of his life, people have always assumed \\"Penn\\" was short for \\"Penny\\" and addressed him believing he was female. * Penn was bothered by his callers misusing the subjunctive. If a caller said \\"If I was x, I would...\\", Penn would remind the caller that he/she was using the subjunctive and must use were (\\"If I were a rich man...\\") instead of was. * Up until the February 1, 2007 show, Penn always had to read the show's phone number (1-866-570-PENN) from his computer screen. He's never been able to commit it to memory. The February 1, 2007 show marked the first time Penn was able to recite the phone number from memory. However, Penn was unable to remember the numerical expansion of \\"PENN\\". * Up until the phone lines were connected directly to Penn's house there would be a significant delay between the time Penn said the caller's name and when the caller would respond, this would sometimes result in the caller being dropped just after they said hello. There was also many times when the caller would be dropped completely and Penn would have to pick another caller from the list.  Music  The Monkey Tuesday theme, composed by Penn & Teller's band leader Mike Jones, debuted on the April 25, 2006 show. It quickly became the most requested piece of music in Jones' repertoire. Despite having published seven albums, he was asked three or four times a night by Penn Radio listeners at the Penn & Teller show to play the Monkey Tuesday theme. The theme was played at the top of a Monkey Tuesday show. Also, whenever either Penn Jillette or a caller said \\"Monkey Tuesday\\" the board operator (Patrick) would play the theme. Penn sometimes would say \\"the Tuesday of Monkeys\\" to not invoke the music. The music was, however, not to be played for Michael Goudeau, although while he was away fill-in co-hosts such as Mac King were allowed to trigger the music.  Frequent callers/e-mailers  *President Mike: President Mike, a frequent caller, planned to one day run for president. He asked Penn to help him by mailing a postcard to every American stating his platform. Although a refreshing plan in a milieu of TV attack ads, Penn calculated the costs of mailing 300 million postcards would prove prohibitive.http://www.pennfans.net/component/option,com_joomlaboard/func,view/id,2398/catid,3/ President Mike *Vlad the Impala: Vlad was a regular emailer to the show; Penn frequently read his commentaries on the day's topic. Vlad was (as of 2007) a 40-something male who lived in Staffordshire, England and worked for Cadbury. Vlad was credited with suggesting the format for \\"Layperson Penn\\" (on the July 14, 2006 episode \\"Cancer Therapy Turndown Friday\\"). *Bob the Skeptical Christian: Bob was a regular emailer. He was a Christian although he was highly skeptical of many of the claims made by his Christian family and friends. There was also a frequent emailer who called himself Christian the Skeptical Atheist. *Renee: Renee was Ren√©e French, a comic book author who lived in Australia. She was a personal friend of Penn.Renee French: Works of Catharsis and Laughter: Interviews & Features Archive ‚Äì Comics Bulletin She frequently bombarded Penn with multiple emails regarding the topic of the day. *Natasha: There were three Natashas who regularly called in and emailed. Penn and Goudeau numbered them Natasha 1.0, Natasha 2.0, Natasha 3.0. Natasha 1.0 was known to be a skeptic and attended Randi's yearly The Amazing Meeting in Las Vegas. Penn had said that Natasha 1.0 was his favorite. *Big Frankie: Big Frankie, as Penn dubbed him, was a young man in Portland, Oregon who had weighed over (with a 64-inch waist) and was taking a year off from work to exercise 8 hours a day. Big Frankie listened to Penn Radio between two 4-hour work outs and called in, giving updates on his weight loss progress. As of April 28, 2007, he reported via the Penn & Teller message board he was down to and a 38\\" waist.

It is in front of (but does not include) the mouth, being usually a small shelf- or lip-like extension over the dorsal side of the mouth. The prostomium together with the peristomium, which includes the mouth and pharynx, make up the annelid head. Scanning electron micrograph of a newly hatched European nightcrawler (Eisenia hortensis) showing the prostomium  Description  The prostomium is part of the head and holds at least part of the brain and often bears sensory structures such as the eyes, antennae and palps. It may function like a kind of overlip when the animal is feeding. The prostomium bears many important taxonomic characters and its shape and composition are important for annelid systematics. In addition to the eyes, antennae and palps, the prostomium can possess appendages such as tentacles or cirri. Moreover, some polychaete prostomia have a posterior extension or ridge with sensory function, called a caruncle. Another sensory organ, the nuchal organ (or a variation, the nuchal epaulette), is a chemosensory, ciliated pit or groove at the posterior end of the prostomium.  Appendages  There may be three antennae present: a pair of lateral antennae and one median antennae. These are most commonly simple, tapering structures, but they may also be articulated or ornamented. There are different arrangements of insertion of the lateral and median antennae, with the lateral antenna sometimes inserted ventrally to the median antennae or vice versa, or they may be inserted on the same plane. In some taxa, the lateral antennae may be missing, leaving only a lone median antenna. The palps are paired and innervated structures that tend to be located ventrally and laterally. They are often associated with the mouth and may have a feeding or sensory function. Tentacular cirri can be any sort of elongated, forward (anterior) facing cirri and can occasionally be found on the prostomium.

It is affiliated to the Scottish Trades Union Congress, and party to the Theatrical Management Association playwright's agreement. History The Scottish Society of Playwrights was founded at a meeting of Scotland's playwrights held in the Netherbow Theatre in September 1973, at the instigation of Hector MacMillan, Ena Lamont Stewart, and John Hall. It was established in response to a need for a co-ordinated voice for playwrights to be heard in Scottish theatre and to act as a playwriting development and promotional agency. It was formally established, after its constitution was drafted by Ian Brown, its first Chair, Hector MacMillan and Ada F Kay in November 1973.Ian Brown, 'More to Come', Edinburgh Review 137, 2013, pp. 90-99. In the first twelve years of its existence the SSP received funding from the Scottish Arts Council. This meant that, besides such tasks as negotiating the first national contract for playwrights with the Federation of Scottish Theatre and representing playwrights in dispute with theatre managements, the Society was able to act as a major development agency for playwrights. During this period, based on the work of the US National Playwrights' Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Center, it developed the model of playwrights' workshops that is now recognised and used throughout the UK by such institutions as North West Playwrights Workshop and the Performing Arts Lab.Ian Brown, 'Playwrights' workshops of the Scottish Society of Playwrights, the Eugene O'Neill Center and their long term impact in the UK', International Journal of Scottish Theatre and Screen, 4.2 (2011) pp. 35-50. It also published important, but neglected, texts, offered members at-cost copying and published a Newsletter which developed in time into Scottish Theatre News. It appointed administrators, firstly Linda Haase and later Charles Hart, who provided outstanding service, Linda Haase going on to help found the Tron Theatre and Charles Hart to be New Writing Officer of the Arts Council in England. In the mid-eighties, the Scottish Arts Council rethought its funding priorities and decided to withdraw funding from what it called 'support services' in favour of 'direct provision'. It was impervious to the fact that support for playwrights through the SSP was in fact direct provision. In 1985, the SSP had to close down its lively and wide-ranging workshop, publishing and copying activities and concentrate on its primary role representing the playwrights of Scotland. In 1986, with the Writers Guild and Theatre Writers Union, it negotiated its agreement with the Theatrical Management Association for the benefit of Scottish playwrights presenting work in England and Wales. Since then, it has represented the interests of playwrights throughout Scotland and abroad, leading a successful playwrights' strike in the early nineties and yet maintaining positive relations with theatre management organisations, north and south of the Border. The SSP continues to be more than simply a negotiating body. In recent years, it has, for example, held a conference in Inverness for northern based playwrights (1999) and produced the first authoritative directory of Scottish playwrights (2001).

It is the highest point in Negros, as well as the whole Visayas Region, with an elevation of above sea level. The volcano straddles the provinces of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental, approximately southeast of Bacolod, the capital and most populous city of Negros Occidental and of the whole island. It is one of the active volcanoes in the Philippines and part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Physical features Kanlaon has a peak elevation of at its highest point, although it is in some sources, with a base diameter of and is dotted with pyroclastic cones and extinct craters lining to the north-northwest. Just below and north of the summit is the active Lugud crater. North of Lugud is a caldera known as Margaja Valley, with a small, often seasonal crater lake.\\"Kanlaon Volcano Page\\" . Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. The volcano has three hot springs on its slopes: Mambukal Hot Springs on the northwest, Bucalan Hot Spring and Bungol Hot Spring. Its adjacent volcanic edifices are Mount Silay and Mount Mandalagan, north of Kanlaon. Canlaon, the component city that has jurisdiction on the Negros Oriental side of the volcano, lies on its lower slope about ESE of the summit. Hiking Destination and Trails The volcano is a favorite spot for mountain climbers and is the centerpiece of Mount Kanlaon Natural Park, a national park originally established on August 8, 1934.\\"NIPAS's 202 Initial list of components\\" .

The hiking trails usually start in the center of the Guintubdan village. Locals have been active in international cooperation working with several European institutions to introduce the pioneering Unified Hiking Marker System as the first inland tourist location in the Philippines. The system is unified across a number of countries. This makes the mountain more attractive for tourists in an ecologically responsible way. =Trails & Hiking Markers System = Basic Marker ‚Äì Red color used for difficult or summit trailsleftIn 2016, first three hiking trails have been marked, with additional and more extensive trails added in 2017 from the center of the Guintubdan village including a trail to the top.

The volunteers marking these trails usually prepare sheet metal or cardboard matrices to keep the signs uniform in size. Any change of direction is marked with arrows of the same color and similar design. Eruptions The most active volcano in central Philippines, Kanlaon has erupted 30 times since 1819. Eruptions are typically phreatic of small-to-moderate size that produce minor ash falls around the volcano. In 1902, the eruption was classified as Strombolian, typified by the ejection of incandescent cinders, lapilli, lava bombs and gas fumes. However, its eruptive history has not yet been recorded and larger Vesuvian eruptions generated by this stratovolcano has not yet been known. Volcanic activity at Kanlaon is continuously monitored by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), the government's bureau that monitors the volcanoes and earthquakes in the nation, although unlike Mayon and Pinatubo, the volcano has never been studied in- depth and its age is not yet accurately calculated. Kanlaon Volcano Observatory is located at the campus of La Carlota City College in the barangay of Cubay, La Carlota City in Negros Occidental. = 1996 Kanlaon Incident = On August 10, 1996, 24 mountain climbers hiked the volcano when Kanlaon erupted without warning, killing British student Julian Green and Filipinos Jamrain Tragico and Neil Perez, who were trapped near the summit close to the crater. The local authorities rescued 17 others, including 10 Belgians, another British climber and six Filipinos while Edwin Ematong, a member of the Negros Mountaineering Club Inc. and who, along with his cousin Neil Perez, guided the British Nationals survived this eruption. He descended the volcano ahead of his group that fateful day. One of the rescued Belgians, Caroline Verlinde, said she and her group were about to leave a site near the crater rim when suddenly the volcano ejected ash, stones and hot gas. She ran to a tree for cover and saw her friends being hit by falling hot tephra. She said their Filipino guide told them the smoke billowing out from the crater \\"was just ordinary.\\"  Recent volcanic activity  = 2001 = PHIVOLCS noted in a March 22, 2001 report that since January 2001, earthquake clusters or occurrences had been recorded by the seismic monitoring network around the volcano. These earthquakes might had signified a reactivation of the volcanic system at depth and could be a precursor to more vigorous activity, such as ash explosions. This interpretation was based on similar earthquake clusters manifested prior to the August 10, 1996 phreatic explosion from the active summit crater of the volcano. In view of the possibility of a sudden ash ejection, PHIVOLCS recommended the immediate suspension of all treks to the summit crater until further notice. As an additional precaution, the pre- defined 4 kilometer radius permanent danger zone (PDZ) should be avoided at all times. = 2002 = An increase in seismic activity during February to April 2002 was followed by raising alert on the volcano. An ash eruption occurred on November 28, 2002. = 2003 = On March 17, 2003, a gray plume was observed above Kanlaon Volcano. Small eruptions produced plumes that rose above the crater of the volcano. A total of 46 minor ash ejections were recorded. After July 23, 2003, only weak emission was noted and seismic activity returned to normal. = 2005 = A brief phreatic ash eruption occurred in the volcano on January 21, 2005, producing a high ash plume. A fine layer of ash fell on the town of Cabagnaan SW of the crater. Ash emissions began again on March 20 and caused minor ash fall in the municipality of Guintubdan W of the volcano. Until April 4, occasional ash eruptions reached 1 km above the volcano, and small ash fall was reported in the municipalities of La Castellana ( SW of the crater), Upper Sag-ang, Yubo ( SW), and Guintubdan ( WNW). Ash eruptions stopped after May 25, 2005. = 2006 = On June 3, 2006, Kanlaon again exhibited restiveness and spewed steam and ash. Alert Level 1 was issued on June 12, 2006. Until July 25, a total of 23 ash eruptions were reported. All eruptions were phreatic (i.e. no fresh magma was ejected), and ejected ash and steam up to above the crater. No significant seismic activity had occurred before or after the ash emissions, indicating the explosions were near surface hydrothermal events. = 2008 = On February 10, 2008, PHIVOLCS issued an alert stating that the seismic network at Kanlaon Volcano recorded a total of 21 low frequency volcanic earthquakes (LFVQ) during the past 24 hours. Due to the increasing number of recorded volcanic earthquakes, PHIVOLCS raised Kanlaon Volcano's alert status from Alert Level 0 to Alert Level 1, which means the volcano is at slightly elevated unrest and volcanic activity could lead to steam and ash ejections.Phivolcs Kanlaon Update A Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ) was maintained around the volcano, as sudden explosions may occur without warning, but no eruptions occurred. = 2009 = In the 8 days from August 23 to September 1, 257 volcanic earthquakes were recorded. Usual seismic activity during quiet periods is 0 to 4 quakes in any 24-hour period. Epicenters of the recorded quakes were clustered at the north-west slope which may indicate movement of an active local fault at the slope induced by pressure beneath the volcano. Surface observations did not show any significant change in the steam emission from the crater. PHIVOLCS maintained the alert status at Level 0.PHIVOLCS = 2015 = On November 23, Kanlaon had a small, steam-driven explosion. PHIVOLCS raised the alert level to 1 (mild restiveness). On December 12, 2015, Kanlaon had two low energy ash eruption. The volcano is still in the state of unrest. The minor ash eruption of the volcano reached as high as . On December 27, 2015, an ash eruption occurred at Kanlaon's active crater. The eruption plume reached as high as . Light ashfall were reported in some barangays near Kanlaon Volcano. On January 2, people in Hinigaran got sick. Many suffered from a respiratory illness with cough and flu-like symptoms. = 2016 = On March 29 at 6:20 pm, Kanlaon erupted for 12 minutes which produced a volcanic plume above the crater and a \\"booming sound\\" was heard in some barangays near the volcano. According to the police department of Canlaon City, several fire balls, which were coming from the crater of the volcano, started to flow following a booming sound and causing a bush fire. PHIVOLCS issued alert level number 1. No casualties were reported. = 2020 = On March 11, 2020, PHIVOLCS raised the volcano's alert level from 0 to 1 due to its abnormal activities since March 9, 2020. 80 volcanic earthquakes has been plotted since then.https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/index.php/kanlaon-volcano-bulletin- menu/9844-kanlaon-volcano-bulletin-11-march-2020-10-00-a-m-alert- level-0-normal-to-alert-level-1-abnormal On June 21, 2020, the Kanlaon volcano showed some signs of increased unrest. By June 22, 2020, the Kanlaon volcano's activity continued, with a series of tectonic earthquakes ranging from M3.2 to M4.7. A total of 278 earthquakes was observed for a 72-hour period (from June 21, 8AM - June 24, 8AM), possibly related to the magmatic activity underneath the volcano. Earthquakes continued, with steam and fumarolic activity rising 200‚Äì300 meters above. PHIVOLCS reminded the public to stay away to the 4-km PDZ (Permanent Danger Zone) around the volcano, as abnormal conditions and sudden phreatic explosions might occur. https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/index.php/kanlaon-volcano-bulletin- menu/10194-kanlaon-volcano-bulletin-22-june-2020-08-00-a-m https://m.facebook.com/PHIVOLCS/photos/a.285127764929462/2874610672647812/?type=3&source;=48 https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/index.php/kanlaon-volcano-bulletin- menu/10200-kanlaon-volcano-bulletin-24-june-2020-08-00-a-m Mythology Mount Kanlaon is surrounded by a variety of myths. A story states that its vicinity was home to a nation ruled by a datu (king or leader) named Laon. The volcano was said to be a former home to a dragon-like monster which was slain by the youthful epic hero, Kan, who was an intimate friend and lover of Laon. Together, Kan and Laon defeated the monster, utilizing strength and wit and Laon's magic birang, which can produce anything the wielder wants. In another story, after many years since the event of Kan and Laon, a king of smallfolk named Harisab√≥qued (Hiligaynon: Hari-sa-Bukid) was said to have ruled Mount Kanlaon. Harisab√≥qued is said to have an army of smallfolk, who aids him in tending a huge tobacco plantation around Mount Kanlaon. He also established the boundaries between the humans and the smallfolk, of which the sacred realms constitute the entire circumference of Mount Kanlaon. The king would eventually retreat himself inside the volcano after a series of events where the humans failed to keep their sacred vows. In another story, after the two events mentioned, the supreme goddess of the Hiligaynon people, Kanlaon (not to be confused with the names of the epic heroes Kan and Laon), chose to change her abode from Mount Madia-as into Mount Kanlaon. The goddess is said to come out from the mountain before, however, due to mankind's dreadful attitude towards the environment, she closed the divine portals which were the entrances of the volcano. She is believed to still reside within Kanlaon Volcano. In another account which combined the stories of Harisab√≥qued and Kanlaon, it is said that Kanlaon, who was depicted in the particular version as male, ruled over the smallfolk and set the boundaries between the volcano and the people. The people eventually disregarded the boundary and their sacred vow, which led to Kanlaon to withdraw himself inside the volcano. Since then, the volcano was protected by the magkupo, a huge serpent with a rooster's crown and powerful crow.

Two Federal Bureau of Prisons officers‚ÄîWilliam A. Miller and Harold Stites‚Äîwere killed along with three of the perpetrators. Fourteen other officers and one uninvolved convict were also injured. Two of the surviving perpetrators were later executed in 1948 for their roles. Alcatraz Alcatraz was a maximum high-security federal prison located on Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco bay. It operated from 1934 to 1963, and had a reputation for being impossible to escape from. As a result, it housed some of the most notorious and high-profile prisoners, in particular ones who had a history of escape attempts. Convicts The escape attempt was planned by Bernard Coy. Three other convicts were involved in the main plan: Marvin Hubbard, Joseph Cretzer and Clarence Carnes. Sam Shockley and Miran Thompson joined the escapees after the attempt had begun. Coy was a depression-era criminal who, in 1937, was sentenced to 25 years for bank robbery. He was moved to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in 1938 from Atlanta, and was soon given the job of cell- house orderly which gave him a relative amount of freedom around the main cellblock. Joe Cretzer was a West Coast gangster and member of the Cretzer- Kyle Gang. In 1940 he was sentenced to 25 years for murder. After two escape attempts in the first months of his incarceration, one of which resulted in another murder charge, he was transferred to Alcatraz. In May 1941, Cretzer, Shockley and two other convicts made an escape attempt from one of the prison's workshops. Carnes was the youngest prisoner to reside at Alcatraz, having been convicted of murder in 1943 at the age of 16. He made a number of escape attempts and by 1946, when he was transferred to Alcatraz, had accumulated both a life sentence and 99 years for kidnapping. Planning Through his role as a cell-house orderly, Coy noticed flaws in the prison's security: firstly, that the gun-gallery at the west end of the cell-house was protected by bars, with no additional mesh or barriers; secondly, that a Federal Bureau of Prisons officer in the gallery had set routines that allowed the convicts to predict when the main cellblock, and when the gallery, would be unobserved.  Takeover  On May 2, 1946, while most convicts and corrections officers were in outside workshops, Coy was in the main cellhouse sweeping the floor around C Block when kitchen orderly Marvin Hubbard called on officer William Miller to let him in as he had just finished cleaning the kitchen. As Miller was frisking Hubbard for any stolen articles, Coy attacked him from behind, and the two men overpowered the officer. They then released Joseph Cretzer and Clarence Carnes from their cells. Bernard Coy, Marvin Hubbard and Joe Cretzer Sam Shockley Miran Thompson The cellhouse had an elevated gun gallery that was regularly patrolled by an armed officer. The officer, Burt Burch, had a set routine, and the convicts had attacked Miller while Burch was away. Coy, as a cellhouse orderly, had over the years spotted a flaw in the bars protecting the gun gallery, which allowed them to be widened using a bar-spreading device consisting of a nut and bolt with client metal sleeve that moved when the nut was turned by a small wrench. Coy thus managed to spread the bars and squeeze through the widened gap (Coy starved himself in order to fit through the space between the widened bars, which was still relatively narrow) into the temporarily vacant gallery and to overpower and bind Burch on his return. Coy kept the Springfield rifle in the gallery and lowered an M1911 pistol, keys, a number of clubs, and gas grenades to his accomplices below. Continuing along the gun gallery, Coy then entered D Block, which was separated from the main cellhouse by a concrete wall and was used for prisoners kept in isolation. There, he used the rifle to force officer Cecil Corwin to open the door to the main cellhouse and let the others in. They then released about a dozen convicts including Sam Shockley and Miran Thompson. Shockley and Thompson joined Coy, Carnes, Hubbard, and Cretzer in the main cellhouse. The other prisoners returned to their cells. Miller and Corwin were placed in a cell in C Block. The escapees now needed to secure the key to the yard door of the prison from which they expected to make their way to the island's dock to seize the prison's launch. The boat docked daily between 14:10 and 14:30. The plan was to use the hostage officers as cover as the prisoners made their way to the dock, then San Francisco and freedom.  Failed escape attempt  Miller had held on to the yard door key (against regulations), so that he could let out kitchen staff without having to disturb the gallery officer at lunch. Although they eventually found the key by searching the captive officers and the cell in which the prisoners had placed them, the door would not open because the lock had jammed as the prisoners had tried several other keys while searching for the correct one. The escape attempt was thus inadvertently foiled from the outset as the prisoners were trapped in the cellhouse. Meanwhile, additional officers who entered the cellhouse as part of their routine were seized along with others sent to investigate when the former officer failed to report in. The prisoners were soon holding nine officers in two separate cells, but with nowhere to go, despair set in among the would-be escapees. Having failed on their initial plan, the prisoners decided toSix Against the Rock by Clark Howard, published in 1978 shoot it out. At 14:35 Coy took the rifle and fired at the officers in some neighboring watchtowers, wounding one of them. Associate warden Ed Miller went to the cellhouse to investigate, armed with a gas billy club. He came across Coy, who shot at him. Miller retreated. By now, the alarm had been raised. Their plan having failed, Shockley and Thompson urged Cretzer, who had one of the guns, to kill the hostages in case they testified against them. Cretzer opened fire on the officers, wounding five, three seriously, including Bill Miller, who later died of his wounds. Carnes, Shockley, and Thompson then returned to their cells, but Coy, Hubbard, and Cretzer decided they were not going to surrender.Alcatraz: The Gangster Years by David Ward, published in 2009 Meanwhile, one of the hostages discreetly wrote down the names of the convicts involved, circling the names of the ringleaders. At about 18:00, a squad of armed officers entering the gun cage were shot at by the convicts. One officer, Harold Stites, was killed, and four other officers were wounded. Prison officials then cut the electricity and put on hold all further attempts to regain control of the cellhouse until darkness. Warden James A. Johnston asked for federal troops from nearby Naval Station Treasure Island to help deal with the situation. Two platoons of Marines under the direction of Generals \\"Vinegar\\" Joe Stilwell and Frank Merrill were dispatched to the island in guarding the general population of convicts and taking the cellhouse from the outside.The Encyclopedia of American Prisons by Carl Sifakis, pg. 9 After night fell, two squads of officers entered the prison to locate and rescue the captive officers. There was a long-standing rule at Alcatraz that no guns were allowed in the cellhouse, and the prison officials did not want more officers injured or killed. The convicts' position on the top of a cell block provided a nearly impregnable firing position as they were out of range of the officers in the gun cages. At 20:00, unarmed officers entered the cellhouse, covered by armed officers in the two gun galleries overhead. They found the hostages; however, one officer was wounded by a gunshot fired from the roof of one of the cell blocks. They locked the open door to D Block. When the last officer reached safety, the officers opened a massive barrage from machine guns, mortars, and grenades on the prisoners within D Block, where the prison authorities erroneously thought one of the armed convicts was holed up. They eventually figured out that the rebellious prisoners were confined to the main cellhouse and ceased their attack until further tactics were worked out. Coy (center), and Cretzer (right) in San Francisco morgue The Marines, led by World War II Veteran, Warrant Officer Charles Lafayette Buckner, IX implemented a plan to drive the armed convicts into a corner with tactics they had perfected against entrenched Japanese resistance during the Pacific War. They drilled holes in the prison roof and dropped grenades into areas where they believed the convicts were to force them into a utility corridor where they could be cornered. On May 3, at about 12:00, the convicts phoned Johnston to try to discuss a deal. Johnston would only accept their surrender. Later that day, a shot was fired at an officer as he checked out C Block's utility corridor. That night, a constant fusillade was fired at the cell block until about 21:00. The following morning, squads of armed officers periodically rushed into the cellhouse firing repeatedly into the narrow corridor. At 09:40 on May 4, they finally entered the corridor and found the bodies of Cretzer, Coy, and Hubbard.  Aftermath  Clarence Carnes (left), Sam Shockley (center), and Miran Thompson (right) on their way to court Before the escape attempt, Hubbard had petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that his confession had been beaten out of him; he had produced hospital records to back up his claims. A federal hearing into the matter had been scheduled for the Monday after he died. The case was dismissed on a motion filed by prosecutor Joseph Karesh, who is quoted as saying that had it gone through, Hubbard would have had \\"a fair chance\\" of being released.Escape from Alcatraz by J. Campbell Bruce, published in 1963 Miran Thompson and Sam Shockley were executed simultaneously in the gas chamber at San Quentin on December 3, 1948, for their roles in the Battle of Alcatraz. Carnes was given an additional life sentence but was eventually released from prison in 1973. However, he breached his parole conditions, was sent back to prison and died there from complications from AIDS in 1988. Increased security measures ensured that there were no more escape attempts until 1956. In total, Prison Guard Harold P. Stites was shot and killed during the rescue attempt while Prison Guard William A. Miller died of his injuries the following day in the cell. 14 others prison guards were wounded in the battle: 8 Prison guards who were taken as a hostages and locked in the cell (Lieutenant Joseph H. Simpson, was shot twice in the stomach. Captain Henry H. Weinhold, was shot twice in the stomach and chest. Prison Guard Cecil D. Corwin, was shot through the face below his left eye. Prison Guard Robert R. Baker, was shot twice in leg and arm. Prison Guard Carl \\"Sunny\\" Sundstrom, was shot twice in the stomach. Prison Guard Joseph Burdette, was wounded in the chest.

Film depictions  Several versions of the events of the Battle of Alcatraz have been depicted on film: * Brute Force (1947), starring Burt Lancaster. Although inspired by the events, this is a highly fictionalized account of an attempted prison break. It was unusual at the time for the level of violence it portrayed. * Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), again starring Burt Lancaster, this film briefly depicts a largely fictional version of the battle which, from the start, is portrayed as a full-scale riot rather than a discrete escape attempt. Lancaster's character, Robert Stroud, the \\"Birdman of Alcatraz\\", is given unwarranted credit for ending the conflict. * Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story (1980), a factually based TV drama of the events incorporated into a larger narrative of the history of Alcatraz as seen through the eyes of its youngest prisoner, Clarence Carnes. * Six Against the Rock (1987), starring David Carradine as Bernard Coy, based on the semi- fictional book by Clark Howard. *Alcatraz (2018), an independent film depicting the events.

Glassing is a physical attack using a glass or bottle as a weapon. Glassings can occur at bars or pubs where alcohol is served and such items are readily available. The most common method of glassing involves the attacker smashing an intact glass in the face of the victim. However, the glass may be smashed before the attack, and then gripped by the remaining base of the glass or neck of the bottle with the broken shards protruding outwards. Glassing is easily prevented by using containers made from plastic or tempered glass instead, but they suffer from unpleasant feel (plastic) and higher expense (for tempered glass). These alternative containers are slowly being adopted in areas with a high frequency of glassing, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. In New Zealand, a similar phenomenon is referred to as \\"bottling\\". Common injuries resulting from glassings are heavy blood loss, permanent scarring, disfigurement and loss of sight through ocular injury. In the United Kingdom, there are over 5,000 injuries per year.

Western Australia  In response to glassing violence, the government of Western Australia in 2011 made recommendations to the state hospitality industry on the use of tempered glass in hotels. The state government and the Australian Hotels Association created a self-regulatory program on the rollout of tempered glass in pubs, with most hotels and bars expected to change over to tempered beer glasses in six to 12 months. Royal Perth Hospital's head of plastic surgery Mark Duncan-Smith described it as an important step in protecting the public.

Owing to rapid economic recovery in the post-World War II period (aided by the American Marshall plan) there were many more job vacancies than people who were available or becoming available in the workforce to fill them. To resolve this situation the countries decided to \\"import\\" workers from the southern Mediterranean basin (including North Africa) on a temporary capacity to fill this labour shortfall. These workers were invitees of the governments and came to Europe initially on the understanding that they could at any point in time in the future be repatriated if and when economic circumstances changed. These Gastarbeiter as they became known in Germany were mainly young unskilled males who very often left their families behind in their country of origin and migrated alone as 'economic migrants'. They worked predominantly in certain areas of the economy where working conditions were poorer than those of indigenous Germans and where the rates of pay were considerably lower. Ultimately they came to predominate in low-paid service-rated employment. The situation remained unchanged until the 1970s economic recession. Jobs were being lost in manufacturing and industry in particular but not necessarily in the occupational types in which the migrants worked. In 1974 the then West German government imposed a ban restricting any future economic migrants and offered the possibility of returning to their country of origin to many others; few migrants took up the offer and they stayed at their jobs or began to receive unemployment assistance from the state. This led to increased tensions and feelings of resentment from many German people. Second wave of migration Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s family reunification took place between Turkish migrants workers and their families. This reunification however took place in Germany rather than in Turkey. In a difficult economic climate after the 1973 oil crisis it was generally believed by most Turks already in Germany that their economic circumstances would be measurably better there than back in Turkey at such a difficult time. The welfare state offered considerable financial support to all people within Germany including immigrants communities. The number of foreign residents therefore increased in absolute terms during this time period. The German government's offer to repatriate people back to their home country was not very successful. This created a difficult situation for the German government which became increasingly worse as the number of immigrants swelled to their highest levels ever. Any resentment, hostility and bitterness already present between indigenous Germans and the Turkish community became progressively worse. This often culminated in physical attacks on immigrants, arson and overt racial discrimination. There was a feeling amongst Germans that \\"they have taken our jobs\\", but this situation only arose because of Germans themselves losing their jobs in industry and manufacturing in particular in the difficult economic situation post 1973. (NB This 'family reunification' corresponds with the second wave on the Everett S. Lee model of migration). Third wave of migration Dates to the period from 1989 onwards with the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the communist regimes in Eastern Europe. East Germans flooded into West Germany along with many ethnic Germans from central and eastern Europe. Germany accepted them as they were political refugees and very often asylum seekers.

Siting of the plant  THEMIS solar power tower, owned by the General Council of the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, was strategically located in the region of Cerdanya, in the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, because the conditions are excellent for solar energy. First, Cerdanya has almost 2400 hours of sunshine a year; second, there is a very low wind limiting the time of disruption of the plant; third, the site is at a high elevation providing stronger sunlight. The land chosen for the plant is on a slope between 6¬∞ and 18¬∞, which is suitable for a power tower.Website on the history of Roussillon  THEMIS research and development centre  thumb Research and development is focused on solar energy, and THEMIS is a research facility as well as a photovoltaic power facility and a solar thermal energy plant. = THEMIS solar thermal energy = The plant had a power output of 2 MW in 1983. It was based on an array of 201 mirrors which heated a cavity receiver (a cavity lined with coolant tubes) at the top of a 100 m tower where the coolant (molten salts) carried the thermal energy to a steam generator, itself powering an electric turbine. The molten salts were potassium nitrate (53%), sodium nitrite (40%) and sodium nitrate (7%). The coolant entry temperature was 250 ¬∞C and the exit temperature 450 ¬∞C. Steam was produced in the generator at a pressure of 50 bar and a temperature of 430 ¬∞C.  History  The cavity receiver used in Th√©mis The first THEMIS solar plant, was an experimental solar facility which produced power between 1983 and 1986, and then closed in part due to the difficulty of managing the cooling system, and in part due to a lack of political and financial support. Construction started in 1979 at a cost of 300 million French francs (about 45 million euros), and was operated and managed by √âlectricit√© de France (EDF). The plant went into hibernation for more than twenty years, and turned into a scientific facility of the CERN, and the Commissariat √† l'√©nergie atomique focusing on astrophysics, with an open air Cherenkov Telescope, measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere (see IACT). In 2004, a rehabilitation program was devised by the General Council of the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, to produce power, and create a research and development centre on solar energy with the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), and Tecsol, a local engineering office. THEMIS still has its 201 sun- following devices called heliostats, most of them still equipped with mirrors (53.70 m¬≤ each) covering an area of 11,800 m¬≤ in total, able to send the solar energy towards the hot spot at the top of the 104 m central tower, where the receiver was originally placed (which is now part of the exhibition outside the Odeillo solar furnace). The heliostats are, however, no longer operational. The three rows of heliostats furthest away from the tower are having their mirrors replaced by solar cells.

The company owner and head luthier, Steve Wishnevsky, specializes in making unorthodox bass guitars out of both exotic and domestic woods. Overview Wishbass are hand-crafted electric basses made from both domestic and exotic woods, although recent designs have favored domestic. They are generally inexpensive due to their simple electronics, design and lack of finish. Wishnevsky is known for what might be considered radical body shapes and for his trademark open headstock, which he claims adds sustain.http://www.wishbass.com Wishnevsky focuses attention on using minimal metal in the construction of his basses, which he claims improves tone. He often features many different wood laminates to make up the bodies of his bass guitars, as do many of his contemporary hobbyists. The nuts and bridges on his basses are usually made of Corian, a plastic material commonly suggested for use as an alternative to bone, suitable for vegans and used by notable guitarmakers such as Gibson and Martin. Wishnevsky builds mainly fretless basses with no trussrods for cheaper construction costs. It is notable that although he is emphatic in using minimal amounts of metal in his basses, most of them feature an aluminum control cavity cover plate. Wishbasses are mainly built with passive electronics, and tone controls are not standard on Wishnevsky's basses. The lack of a tone control limits the player's ability to manipulate the tonal qualities of the bass guitar by electrical means. Most Wishbasses are characterized by a rather large headstock and a thick neck that is more characteristic of an upright bass than as electric bass. This also lessens the need for a truss rod (which can be added upon request). There are eleven basic models or styles listed on the Wishbass website. The names listed below are templates and the similarities end there, as every Wishbass is different. The styles listed on Wishnevsky's site are the Stude, Hipper, Peanut, Scroll, Standard, JB, Arrow, Swirl, Kewel, Fantasy and Scarab. At the time of this writing. Steve Wishnevsky has handmade over 1,500 Wishbasses. Wishbass Modifications While many Wishbass owners keep their basses as they came from Wishnevsky, there is a large Wishbass fan base that views Wishbasses as the raw materials for a more sophisticated bass. They begin with a stock, but often rather crude (but usually playable) Wishbass and modify according to their own requirements. Typically this involves refinishing Steve's minimal finish (\\"just enough lacquer to keep the beer from soaking through\\") with many coats of TruOil or the like, replacing the aluminum cavity covers with wood ones that match or complement the natural woods of the bass and even reshaping the body and/or headstock. Minimal electronics are expanded with stacked pots, varitones, pre-amps or by changing or adding pickups. The end result is a stunning, unusual bass that in a sense becomes a sort of a creative collaboration between Steve and the owner. (See the Wishbass threads on the Talkbass Forum for more details.) This results are one way to deal with some of the criticisms of Steve's instruments while keeping the tone and other features inherent in his designs. Fire On the early morning of February 17, 2015, the Wishbass workshop & about 30 commissioned instruments were lost by fire.http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/winston-salem-musician-loses- workshop-to-fire-tuesday- morning/article_211d5018-b6c1-11e4-87ea-17e5efaaa34d.html Since then, a fundraiser was started & he will be working again as 'Wishbass 2.0'.

Playing career =Wests Tigers= Gibbs made his NRL debut against Penrith in August 2003, scoring a try with his first touch of the ball. \\"I came off the bench for the Tigers against Penrith at Penrith. I got the ball and scored and thought 'how good‚Äôs this',\\" Gibbs later said.

However, by the middle of 2011, Wests Tigers had released Gibbs in order to make room for Adam Blair, and he signed a three-year contract with the Cronulla Sharks from the start of 2012. Gibbs later said of his release, \\"I found out they didn't want me when I picked up the paper. The paper report said the club was punting me, Liam Fulton and Chris Heighington, but I didn't know what was going on. I can remember walking into the weights room and all the boys started laughing and saying, 'You are gone.' It wasn't a joke though because it was true. It was pretty embarrassing and devastating.\\" By the time Gibbs left the Wests Tigers, he had been a regular in the starting team for a number of years, and was one of the club's most experienced players, having played in 155 games.

Midway through 2012, having yet to score since the 2005 Grand Final, Gibbs declared he would not cut his hair until he had another try. He said, \\"my kids have actually never even seen me score.

It is located on ulica Piwna (\\"Beer Street\\") in the Polish capital's Old Town. History It was established in 1353 together with the adjacent Augustinians cloister and a hospital of the Holy Spirit intra muros by Siemowit III duke of Masovia and his wife Eufemia. In 1571 the famous Wojciech Oczko was made a hospital doctor. The church itself, which was a stone, gothic building, was erected at the turn of 14th and 15th century. Its entrance was located from the side of the town walls, not from Piwna street where it is today. The temple had three altars: the main altar of St. Martin and side altars of the Holy Ghost and of St. Dorothy. The interior before 1939. In the 17th century in the churchyard of the Augustinians' Monastery sessions of local Mazovian parliament were organised. After some fires, which destroyed the church in the 15th and 17th centuries, it was converted in baroque style by Giovanni Spinola from Italy. Also at that time the church was reoriented, the main entrance was changed to Piwna Street, and the altar was moved to the south-western side (to the side of the town walls). In the 17th century, a good standard orchestra was maintained by the Augustinians, which performed in the church. Inside, Adam Jarzƒôbski was buried, a musician and composer that worked for the kings of the Vasa Dynasty. The monastery courtyard. The church was reconstructed in about 1744 according to Karol Bay's design, and resembles the architecture of Bay's Church of Order of the Visitation. The main fa√ßade of waved lines represent so-called Melted Sugar style in rococo architecture. The central altar was also changed according to Karol Bay's design with sculptures by Jan Jerzy Plersch in 1751. Interior The facade is baroque, although the interior is completely modern. The profuse early baroque furnishings, created in the 1630s by Jan Henel (sculptor of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa) together with the rococo decorations done in the 1750s, were destroyed by German bombing during the Warsaw Uprising. The church was ruined. It was reconstructed after World War II. Inside the church, at the end of the right nave, there is a chapel of Our Lady of Consolation with a copy of a painting from the 15th century, and at the end of the left one - there is the chapel of Jesus Christ. Next to the sanctuary there is a chapel of St. Francis with the most valuable element of the church's furnishing - a polychromed figure of the Virgin Mary with the Child.

It is located in the fertile agricultural belt of Northern India and is 300 km from Delhi and 200 km from Lucknow. History Sometime after 1250 AD, one branch of Gaur Rajputs established kingdoms at Chandra, Maholi and Katesar in Sitapur in present Uttar Pradesh. A daughter of Chandra House of Gaurs was married to Rao Gopal Singh, the Katehria chieftain of Nahil. Rao Gopal Singh was killed in a battle by Rohilla Pathans and his widow sought the aid of her Gaur kinsmen on behalf her two infant sons. Thereupon Bhupat Singh and Himmat Singh of Chandra led a force into the district to re-establish the Katehrias at Nahil. Repeated attacks and disputes with the pathans compelled Bhupat Singh to send his son, Raja Udai Singh to Nahil's aid. Raja Udai Singh defeated the pathans at Deokali and established his estate at Pawayan. He established a Fortress at Pawayan around 1705 AD and there after his descendants established Pawayan as the largest Rajput Estate in Rohilkhand area. Legend goes that Pawayan was established originally from east of Nahil or formed the Poorvaiyan chowk. Poorvaiyan over passage of time got distorted to Pawayan or Powayan. With time the estate of Nahil lost luster and Puwayan flourished under the Gaur rulers. The title of ‚ÄòRaja‚Äô is hereditary and was recognized by the colonial British in subsequent years. The estate of the Tilakdhari Rajas of Powayan had 537 villages in Parganas of Pawayan, Baragaon and Khutar. The Pawayan Tahsil is bounded on the south-west by Tilhar and Shajahanpur, south and east by Kheri district, north and west by Puranpur & Bisalpur tahsils of Pilibhit district.

He first appeared in Keen Detective Funnies #23 (Aug. 1940), in a story by artist Harry Sahle and an unconfirmed writer, generally credited as George Kapitan. Keen Detective Funnies was cancelled after issue #24, but Centaur published two more stories in Detective Eye Comics #1 and 2 (Nov-Dec 1940) before pulling the plug on the character. After Centaur Publications went out of business, Airman lapsed into the public domain. In the early 1990s, he was revived by Malibu Comics as a character in the series Protectors, and starred in a namesake, one-shot spin- off. An Airman story from Keen Detective Funnies #24 has been reprinted in Men of Mystery Comics #63 by AC Comics.  Centaur Comics  The original Air Man is Drake Stevens, son of Claude Stevens, a renowned ornithologist. When his father is senselessly murdered, the police are unable to bring the killer to justice. Outraged, Drake puts together a costume consisting of a pair of gas- filled wings and a jet-pack, establishing the crime-fighting identity of Airman. He also utilizes guns and bombs in his quest for justice. In one story, he fights pirates aboard a \\"Ghost Ship\\".  Malibu Comics  Malibu Comics' version: Airman #1 (Jan. 1993). Cover art by Thomas Derenick. The new version of Airman debuted in contemporary times. His origin is nearly identical to the original incarnation, except in this version, his father is named Edward and the murderer is revealed to be a supervillain named Captain Klegg. His suit is also different from the original. In addition to a jet pack and the wings on the old suit, the new suit boasts motorized talons in the boots and gloves, as well as a utility belt and a specially designed cowl that gives him telescopic vision. In the Protectors universe, the heroes have gone into hiding following a disastrous battle at the town of Brinkston. They are drawn together to face Mr Monday, and the Protectors are formed. While on the team, Drake is often insecure because of his relative inexperience. He is a friend and an ally of Thresher, the son of Neptune and a mermaid. He rescues the hero in the pages of his own series from the clutches of the Conqueror, a supervillain minion of major Protectors foe the Great Question.  Dynamite Entertainment  In 2008, the character was brought back by Dynamite Entertainment as part of their Project Superpowers storyline. This version of the character matches the original Golden Age version, but is brought from the World War II‚Äìera into modern times as part of the storyline.

Her paternal grandparents were Antoine, Duke of Lorraine and Ren√©e of Bourbon-Montpensier and her maternal grandparents were Christian II of Denmark and Isabella of Austria. Life Renata was described as a beauty and a desirable match. In 1558, after the death of his first wife Prince William of Orange expressed a desire to marry Renata. Her mother, Christina, liked the idea, and it was further cemented after the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis. This match was however prevented by King Philip of Spain.Cartwright, Julia. Christina of Denmark: Duchess of Milan and Lorraine 1522‚Äì1590.

Christina of Denmark: Duchess of Milan and Lorraine 1522‚Äì1590. New York, 1913 In 1561, Renata's mother planned to marry her to king Frederick II of Denmark. However, the outbreak of the Nordic Seven Years' War between Denmark and Sweden in 1563, interrupted these plans. From 1565 to 1567, Christina negotiated with King Eric XIV of Sweden to create an alliance between Sweden and Denmark through his marriage to Renata. The plan was for Christina to conquer Denmark with the support of Sweden, a plan Eric supported.Cartwright, Julia. Christina of Denmark: Duchess of Milan and Lorraine 1522‚Äì1590. New York, 1913 However, Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand opposed the plan due to the destructive effect it could have on the balance of power among the German nations, if Saxony (being strongly allied with Denmark) opposed Christina's claims. Neither did she manage to acquire the support of Philip of Spain. The planned marriage alliance between Lorraine and Sweden was finally ended when Eric XIV married his non-noble lover Karin M√•nsdotter in 1567.Cartwright, Julia. Christina of Denmark: Duchess of Milan and Lorraine 1522‚Äì1590.

The event was described in detail by Massimo Troiano in his Dialoghi (1569). Approximately 5,000 riders took part in it, and the music was composed by Orlande de Lassus. Despite their large wedding and status, Renata, along with her husband, led a life of charity and humility. They left the Munich Residenz and lived in the Jesuit Kollegienbau west of Munich. Renata took care of the sick, the poor and religious pilgrims. In this task, she was completely supported by her husband. After he inherited the duchy in 1579 as William V of Bavaria, Renata spent much of her time in the Herzogspitalkirche in Munich, founded in 1555 by her father-in-law. Renata died in Munich, aged 58. Her grave is located in the St. Michael's Church in Munich, the consecration of which was the last high point in both her and her husband's lives.

To establish Birgunj Bazar in a forest covered area, Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana appointed his trusted duo Siddhvir Mathema and Dhadjavir Mathema (two brothers) respectively in Birgunj as the ruler of Mal Ada and Kath Mal Ada. In this connection, Siddhvir Mathema distributed free land and timber and provided cash assistance to the homeowners in Birgunj. The act had subsequently required Siddhvir Mathema to pay the death penalty. After the death of Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, Dev Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana became Prime Minister, but within three months Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana had driven Dev Shamsher and made himself Prime Minister. The people of Late Bir Shamsher Rana and Dev Shamsher Rana did not tolerate Chandra Shamsher Rana. Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana'special man Siddhivir Mathema, was accused of conducting an inspection of a reservoir treaty and carrying out three lakh irregularities on his forehead. When Siddhivir showed the calculations he had spent on setting up Birganj Bazar, he was declared invalid and an order was issued to pay the money immediately. After answering that he could not pay for what he did, As a punishment, the signboard was stick on his chest and move it around the market. The verbal verdict of the death sentence was decided to cut off and kill. After hearing about verbal of death sentence to Mathema who worked day and night without eating to establish Birgunj Bazar, Late Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana's wife has paid 3 lakh and rescued Mathema from the death penalty. Chandra Shamsher also wanted to displace Birgunj Bazar, which his brother had established. He wanted to remove the Birgunj bazaar from there and set it in Rautahat. According to the move to displace the market, In 1959, it raided the main market from Raxaul to Birgunj and extended the rail line service to Amalekhganj. From the link, the train used to run around the houses, exploding and terrorizing the residents. Later, the rail link was moved to the east of the market (outside the market). The Raxaul city in India, which is currently connected to Birgunj as the main gateway to Nepal, was not established. At that time Indian trains operated only till Sugauli. =Modern= On 18 May 2006, the parliament of Nepal declared that the country would become a secular state.

Birgunj railway station is connected by the Nepal Government Railway (NGR) to Raxaul Junction railway station in Bihar across the border with India. The railway extends north to Amlekhganj in Nepal. It was built in 1927 by the British but discontinued beyond Birgunj in December 1965.[3] The 6 km (3.7 mi) railway track from Raxaul to Birgunj was converted to broad gauge two years after the Indian railways converted the track to Raxaul inside India to broad gauge.

There is a bus terminal from where buses are available for most of cities in Bihar & Jharkhand. =Airlines and destinations= Raxaul Airport (ICAO: VERL) is located at Ekderwa Raxaul in the state of Bihar, India. It was established after the Sino-Indian War of 1962, when it served as an emergency landing ground for the Indian Army. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) that owns the airport has undertaken a pre- feasibility study at the airport to upgrade the airport to handle ATR-72 aircraft. A draft Master Plan highlighting a requirement of an additional 121 acres of land has been submitted to the State Government. Now, there is currently no scheduled commercial air service. Raxaul can be reached by flying to Simara in Nepal. That airport is 27 km from Raxaul and has direct flights to Kathmandu.

It flows southwards from the place of its origin for about 15 km in Nepal and then enters India at Raxaul. From here, the river flows about 20 km in India and joins Burhi Gandak near Sugauli in East Champaran district. The water is pure in its contents and have full of medicinal values like other Himalayan rivers. It maintains its valuable contents till Parwanipur. But after it, unrestrained untreated wastes are being dumped by the 46 factories situated at Birgunj (Nepal) which make this river contaminated. The colour of the river turned into black besides, emanating foul smell has made the life of the people, who dwell near the river, a nightmare.

Welsh Water uses the resurgence at the Schwyll Spring near Ewenny in the Vale of Glamorgan as the main source of water for the Bridgend area. Now functioning as a backup supply, it has a number of associated source protection zones policed by Natural Resources Wales. The aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock. In this case, it consists of an underground waterway in the carboniferous limestone. Due to the delay between local heavy rain and discoloration of the water at the spring, it is believed that the origination is 20 miles away. This would locate the main source in the limestone of the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons. The lack of an access at the rising hinders exploration of the cave system. The only known point of access is at the pumping shaft of the extraction plant at Schwyll. The system was explored by cave divers in 1998 to 440 metres from the shaft. At 400 metres, a large cavern was discovered containing bones which were identified as horse. The bones were submitted for dating.

He was the first superhero published by Centaur Publications. The character first appeared in 1938 in Funny Pages #21 (numbered vol. 2, #10; dated September 1938). He continued in the comic until issue #42 (Oct 1940), and then had his own series, The Arrow, which lasted for three issues from Oct 1940 to Oct 1941. The Arrow is actually Ralph Payne, a military intelligence agent who uses his archery skills to fight crime. He delivers messages via arrow, both to criminals and the police, and uses his bow to kill the evildoers. Today, the Arrow is mostly remembered for being the first American superhero to rely on archery as a primary gimmick. Centaur Publications The character was created for Centaur Publications by Paul Gustavson. After Gustavson's departure from the company, Bob Lubbers took over the strip. During Lubbers' tenure, the character's true identity was revealed for the first time: he was a military intelligence agent named Ralph Payne. Malibu Comics Malibu Comics' version of the Arrow. After Centaur Publications went out of business in 1942, the Arrow, along with most other company properties, lapsed into public domain. The Arrow was briefly revived by Malibu Comics, appearing as part of their Protectors/Genesis imprint. He starred in the Protectors series and the Arrow one-shot. The character has been dormant after Marvel Comics acquired Malibu Comics, although some of his Golden Age adventures were reprinted by AC Comics. In Malibu Comics' Protectors/Genesis universe, the Arrow is a former intelligence agent named Rick Palmer. Born somewhere in Texas, he grew up to become an avid hunter. His weapon of choice is the bow and arrow, because he feels that said weapons represent the greatest challenge and give the prey the fairest chance. Following a stint with the military, Rick is recruited into one of the intelligence branches of the US government. He is posted in a small, struggling Latin American country caught in the throes of civil war. While there, he witnesses the massacre of an entire village by the modernized forces loyal to that country's government. He eventually learns the country is being funded by the US government. Sickened by what he learned, Rick resigns. He decides to use his archery skills to fight for justice, adopting the crime-fighting identity of the Arrow, the hunter of men. The Arrow primarily operates alone. At one point, he teams up with a number of heroes during a battle in Brinkston ‚Äî an event whose ultimate outcome convinces him to retire. When the members of the Protectors are asked to face Mr. Monday and re-form the superhero team, the Arrow requests to join his former comrades, but is refused due to his violent approach. Dynamite Entertainment The Arrow is one of the many public domain Golden Age characters appearing in Project Superpowers, a 2008 miniseries released by Dynamite Entertainment. He made several short appearances in the series. He also appears in Dynamite's series, The Death- Defying 'Devil and Black Terror.

It was discovered 29 July 1960, by German astronomer Joachim Schubart at Sonneberg Observatory in eastern Germany. The S-type asteroid has a long rotation period of 130 hours. It was named after astronomer William Herschel.  Orbit and classification  Herschel is a member of the Phocaea family (), a large family of stony asteroids with nearly two thousand known members. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7‚Äì3.1 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,341 days; semi-major axis of 2.38 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.30 and an inclination of 23¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Johannesburg Observatory in 1934, extending the body's observation arc by 26 years prior to its official discovery observation at Sonneberg. The relatively high orbital eccentricity of this object causes it to come close to the orbit of the planet Mars. This means there is a chance it will eventually collide with the planet, with the odds of a collision estimated at 18% per billion orbits.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honour of the English astronomer of German origin William Herschel (1738‚Äì1822), who discovered what he called Georgium Sidus (aka Uranus). The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 October 1977 (). While the minor planet with number \\"1000\\", 1000 Piazzia, honors the discoverer of the first minor planet, Giuseppe Piazzi, number \\"2000\\" does so for Herschel, discoverer of the first telescopic major planet. The asteroid is one of several early \\"kilo-numbered\\" minor planets that were dedicated to renowned scientists or institutions including: * 1000 Piazzia named for Giuseppe Piazzi, discoverer of Ceres * 2000 Herschel for William Herschel who discovered Uranus * 3000 Leonardo for the Italian polymath of the Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci * 4000 Hipparchus for ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus The sequence continues with the asteroids 5000 IAU (for the International Astronomical Union), 6000 United Nations (for the United Nations), 7000 Curie (for the pioneers on radioactivity, Marie and Pierre Curie), and (for Isaac Newton), while 9000 Hal (after HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey) and 10000 Myriostos (after the Greek word for ten-thousandth, which is meant to honor all astronomers) were named based on their direct numeric accordance.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Herschel is a common S-type asteroid. = Slow rotator and tumbler = Analysis of the lightcurve for this object appears to show that it is tumbling, with rotation occurring about the non-principal axis. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a high brightness variation of magnitude (). This makes it a slow rotator. = Diameter and albedo = The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a stony asteroid of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 16.71 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.25. According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Herschel measures between 14.768 and 17.385 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1870 and 0.256.

It Located just 75 km west of Kathmandu, known as historic town which was the capital of the Valley in the days before the unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah, and for more than 1,000 years the hilltop had served as a lookout and fort (kot) guarding the western entrance to Kathmandu Valley. Nuwakot served as an important trading hub for the Malla kings of the Valley, and was along a major transit route used for trade between India and Tibet (via Kerung). Making the Nuwakot hill as main forts including other eight forts: Malakot, Simalkot, Bhairabkot, Belkot, Kalikot, Salyankot, Dhuwankot and Pyaskot in its surrounding area, collectively named as 'Nawakotta'(Nine forts). Because of its significance, the fort was a target for conquest by neighboring kingdoms, including the Kingdom of Gorkha. The founder of modern Nepal, Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked and finally captured the hill fort in a surprise attack on September 26, 1744. The Malla king Jaya Prakash Malla made one final attempt to get victory over Nuwakot the following year after Malla forces under Kasi Ram Thapa had defeated the Gorkha army at Naldum. However, the Gorkha army was able to repel the attack and secured Nuwakot as a permanent fort under Gorkha control. Nuwakot would afterwards serve as one of the key staging grounds for the eventual conquest of all three Malla kingdoms in the Kathmandu Valley (Kathmandu, Patan, Bhadgaon), which fell between 1768 and 1769 to Prithvi Narayan Shah. Nuwakot has featured in several prominent moments of Nepali history. Chinese forces under General Fu-k'ang-an nearly captured Nuwakot during the Nepal-China conflict in 1792. It was also the location of the first meeting between the British envoy Captain William J. Kirkpatrick and the acting Regent Bahadur Shah in 1793, shortly after the war with China ended. The current seven-story Nuwakot Durbar and surrounding complex was expanded in the 18th Century by Prithvi Narayan Shah to support the growing trade routes linking Kathmandu with India and Tibet.Nuwakot Palace Complex - UNESCO World Heritage Centre Built in the Malla style, the architecture of the complex is divided into the main palace, the Bhairab Temple, as well as other temples and shrines.

It is one of the oldest acting schools and theatres in Los Angeles County, California. It is located at 254 South Robertson Boulevard in Beverly Hills. The early years The location was originally home to the respected Bliss-Hayden School of Acting run by a husband and wife team of motion picture actors‚Äîactress Lela Bliss with over 45 credits stretching from 1915 to 1965, and her husband actor Harry Hayden with over 260 credits from 1936 to 1955. Veronica Lake, Mamie Van Doren and many other professional actors studied there. In 1954, the Bliss-Hayden Theatre was acquired by Douglas Frank Bank and Jay Manford, and renamed The Beverly Hills Playhouse. This was a showcase for many productions written by Douglas Bank (The Preacher, and Journey to a Lonely Star) as well as well-known plays of the time including Jenny Kissed Me, Room Service, The Lawyer, Harvey, and The Second Man. Many actors had performed there including Stanley Adams, Anne Baxter, Ken Mayer, Michael Fox and Louella Parsons, and directors Larry Stewart and Arthur M. Lowe, Jr., as well as others. They owned the theatre until 1959. Modern era In 1978, Milton Katselas, the noted director and acting teacher, moved his already established and renowned acting classes to the location. For the next 30 years he taught such stars as George Clooney,George Clooney, YouTube Lana Parrilla, Alec Baldwin, Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Selleck, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ted Danson, Tony Danza, Jeffrey Tambor, Gene Reynolds, Tyne Daly, Mel Harris, Catherine Bell, Sofia Milos, Christy Carlson Romano, Jenna Elfman, Doris Roberts, Patrick Swayze, Miguel Ferrer, James Cromwell, Anne Archer, Larry Miller, John Glover, James Wilder, Jennifer Aspen, Jorge Garcia. The Beverly Hills Playhouse (BHP) Acting School The Beverly Hills Playhouse is one of the city's oldest and most respected. The BHP is one of only a few schools that not only teaches the craft of acting, but also attitude and administration. With regard to acting technique, the BHP uses Katselas' approach, which is decidedly independent of the major acting philosophies of Stanislavski, Strasberg, Adler, Meisner, Hagen, etc. His experience as a director led him to a highly individual and adaptive way of training actors, mostly based in the simple observation and recreation of human behavior, along with an understanding of what's happening in the story. It is a down-to-earth training, with vastly reduced emphasis on exercises, and with techniques to create full, believable performances that enlighten and entertain. There has been some controversy regarding the BHP and Scientology. This was because Milton Katselas was a well-known Scientologist, and as such drew the favor of Scientologist actors such as Anne Archer, Giovanni Ribisi, Marisol Nichols, Catherine Bell, Jenna Elfman and others who were his students as well. Some of the teachers on the staff of the school were Scientologists. During Milton's life there were persistent rumors that he was trying to proselytize his religion through his teaching - but the total percentage of students who had any connection with Scientology was never more than 10%, and in 2004 Katselas in fact fell out of favor with Scientologist celebrities. By 2007, almost all those involved with the movement left the school. Also, as Katselas was highly respected by countless non-Scientologist actors such as Doris Roberts and John Glover, his reputation remained primarily that of a first rate teacher above all else. Since Katselas' death in 2008, the BHP has been run by his longtime administrators Allen Barton, Gary Grossman and Art Cohan - longtime teachers in their own right at the school, and the BHP's connection with Scientology appears currently to be zero. The BHP operates out of its headquarters in Beverly Hills, but also has a satellite operation in Los Feliz at the Skylight Theatre, as well as programs in San Francisco and New York City. Since 1984, it has also had an in-house non-profit theatre company (currently called The Skylight Theatre Company), which has produced hundreds of theatre productions, largely originated and fulfilled by the talent and interests of the BHP students. Its current focus under the leadership of Gary Grossman is the development of new plays, using the full array of talent available in the Los Angeles theatre community.

The asteroid has a rotation period of 6.8 hours and measures approximately in diameter  Classification and orbit  Leverrier is an S-type asteroid and member of the Flora family, one of the largest families of stony asteroids. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.7 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,199 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first observed as at the Abastuman Observatory in Georgia on 28 September 1940. Its first used observation was made at Palomar Observatory in 1950, extending the body's observation arc by 13 years prior to the official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named after French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier (1811‚Äì1877). In 1846, he predicted the existence and position of the planet Neptune by applying the mathematics of celestial mechanics. The Martian and lunar craters Le Verrier are also named in his honor. Its name was suggested by MPC-director Brian G. Marsden, after whom the minor planet 1877 Marsden is named. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 October 1977 ().  Physical characteristics  In March 2016, a modeled rotation period for Leverrier was published using data from the Lowell Photometric Database (LPD). Using lightcurve inversion and convex shape models, as well as distributed computing power and the help of individual volunteers, a period of 8.015 hours could be obtained for this asteroid from the LPD's sparse-in-time photometry data (). According to the survey carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, Leverrier measures 6.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.166. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.181 and a concurring diameter of 6.8 kilometers, with an absolute magnitude of 13.3. When using a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, its mean diameter is between 6 and 14 kilometers for an assumed albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25.

Additional synods were held in 394, 397, 401 and 426. Some were attended by Augustine of Hippo. The synod of 393 is best known for two distinct acts. First, for the first time a council of bishops listed and approved a Christian Biblical canon that corresponds closely to the modern Catholic canon while falling short of the Orthodox canon. The canon list approved at Hippo included six books later classed by Catholics as deuterocanonical books and by Protestants as Apocrypha; but also included, as 'two books of Ezra', the Old Latin books First Ezra and Second Ezra, of which only the latter would subsequently be found in the Catholic canon. The canon list was later approved at the Council of Carthage (397) pending ratification by the \\"Church across the sea\\", that is, the See of Rome. Previous councils had approved similar, but slightly different, canons. The council also reaffirmed the apostolic origin of the requirement of clerical continence and reasserted it as a requirement for all the ordained, in addition requiring that all members of a person's household must be Christian before that person can be ordained. Rules regarding clerical succession were also clarified at the Synod, as well as certain liturgical considerations.  Canonical scriptures  The canonical scriptures are listed in Canon xxxvi as follows: The \\"five books of Solomon\\", according to Augustine, were Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus.http://www.bible-researcher.com/carthage.html In the De doctrina christiana, Augustine explains the relation between the two books of Ezra/Esdras and its separation with the Chronicles (partly included in the Septuagint's 1 Esdras): \\"... and the two of Ezra, which last look more like a sequel to the continuous regular history which terminates with the books of Kings and Chronicles.\\"Augustine of Hippo.

Their primary role is to set up a safe system of work to protect staff from trains and trains from staff and activities. The preferred safe systems of working where the staff are protected from line open to train movements, either by blocking some or all lines to traffic or controlling the distance the group is from the track (called Safeguarded / Fenced / Separated areas in order of consideration). This method was formerly called a Green Zone. This is the safest way of working due to the higher risks with trains moving at speed, although many incidents still happen within blocks. Open Line working (formerly known as Red Zone) means the lines are open to train movements; this is seen as more risky than Safeguarded / Fenced / Separated areas, and is avoided in the rail industry where practicable. The COSS is responsible for the safety of the entire group and is subject to prosecution should someone be killed or injured by their negligence. To become a COSS someone should have served a suitable period of time on the railways and undertake a five-day course. This is then followed by a period of mentoring by an experienced COSS and then independent regular assessments to ensure that the subject is competent to undertake their role safely and effectively. The rules around performing the role of a COSS are stated in the Rule Book a set of documents issued to track staff detailing their duties. A COSS is distinguishable on site by wearing a blue armlet with white lettering the word \\"COSS\\". Previously, the COSS was known as the Person In Charge Of Work/Possession, or PICOW/PICOP.

A Last Train bid is typically made in a bidding sequence in which one of the partners has already indicated slam interest. A survey in the magazine The Bridge World showed a strong consensus approving the Last Train convention, with the following definition: The convention was both devised by Jeff Meckstroth and named by him after the Monkees song \\"Last Train to Clarksville\\". Because Last Train is a bidding convention with a special meaning under a partnership agreement, subject to National Regulatory Authority rules it must be . In the absence of any partnership agreement, most players would interpret the Last Train bid as a control bid, showing a high card value in the suit named. Examples 1 - 3 4 - 4 The 4 bid shows a club control and slam interest. If the partnership has agreed to use Last Train, the 4 bid indicates extra values (i.e., responder's hand is at the upper end of the strength range indicated by the 3 bid), and invites partner to continue exploring slam. 4 does not show a diamond control, although of course responder might have one. 1 - 4 4 The 4 bid asks responder to consider bidding slam with values beyond those already shown (4 is a splinter bid showing at least four spades and a singleton diamond).

In the nineteenth century an industrial community lived here working at the brickworks and tinplate works that occupied the site. When the industrial activity ceased in the mid-twentieth century, the buildings were demolished and the site lay derelict. It has now been redeveloped as a golf course as part of the Llanelli Waterside regeneration plan. History Machynys translates from the Welsh as \\"Monk's Island\\", and thus, local legend holds that the area was home to a monastery built by Saint Pyr in 513, although there is no concrete evidence of its existence. Another meaning of the name's origin is that it was Calle \\"Bach ynys\\" meaning \\"small island\\", and the \\"b\\" turned into an \\"m\\" (Bachynys- Machynys). It is further assumed from its name that Machynys was once an island, at least at high tide. It was shown as an island on a map of the Stepney Estate as late as 1761. Until the mid-nineteenth century a single farm occupied the site, but after the Enclosure Acts enabled common land to be developed, industrial development began at Machynys with the digging of clay and the opening of the first of three brickworks. The row of cottages known as \\"Brick Row\\" was probably built then. After the tinplate industry got underway at Kidwelly and Llanelli, a tinplate works was built at Machynys in 1872 that became known as the \\"South Wales Works\\". Two other tinplate works opened on the peninsular in 1910 and 1912 and workers housing was built. The tinplate was mostly exported to America. Machynys Peninsula Golf Country Club In 1951, a huge new tinplate factory was opened at Trostre on the other side of Llanelli. The Machynys factories could not compete and closed by 1961. Many of the workers moved to Trostre, their houses and the tinplate works were demolished. For many years the site remained largely derelict awaiting abortive regeneration plans. The site has been transformed beyond recognition since 1960. It is now home to the Machynys Peninsula Golf Country Club which hosted the Wales Ladies Championship of Europe from 2005-2008. To the west of the golf course lies a recent development, Nicklaus Village (), that consists of 175 New England style homes. Machynys is part of the Welsh Assembly Government's Llanelli Waterside regeneration plan. The Llanelli Millennium Coastal Park, which includes National Cycle Network route 4, runs along the coast of Machynys. There are scenic views of the Gower Peninsula and the Bury Estuary from along the coast.

(ICTSI) () is a global port management company headquartered in Manila, Philippines. Established December 24, 1987, ICTSI is the Philippines' largest multinational and transnational company, having established operations in both developed and emerging market economies in Asia Pacific, the Americas, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The company is ranked the eighth largest container terminal operator, according to TEU equity volume. History ICTSI was established by Spanish- Filipino businessman Enrique K. Razon Jr., whose family has been managing harbors in the Philippines for three generations, in connection with the bidding for the privatization of the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT). In 2019, Forbes named Razon the fourth richest Filipino and the 379th richest individual in the world, with a personal wealth of $5.1 billion. In May 1988, the Philippine Ports Authority awarded the MICT contract to ICTSI, which started its operations of MICT on June 12, 1988. In March 1992, ICTSI's shares were listed on the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges (now the Philippine Stock Exchange) following the initial public offering of its shares. ICTSI is an international operator of common user container terminals serving the global container shipping industry. Its business is the acquisition, development, operation and management of container terminals focusing on facilities with total annual throughputs ranging from 50,000 to 3,000,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). It also handles break bulk cargoes and provides a number of ancillary services such as storage, container packing and unpacking, inspection, weighing, and services for refrigerated containers or reefers. ICTSI is an independent port operator with no vested interests in shipping line activity. It is, therefore, looked upon as a neutral operator that can offer an equal standard of service to all shipping line clients. ICTSI management is known throughout the world for the development and management of highly efficient and operationally effective container terminals and ports, in both developing and developed political and economic environments. Asia Pacific Manila International Container Terminal, Manila, Philippines In 1988, ICTSI won in an international tender a 25+25-year concession to manage, operate and develop the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT), ICTSI's flagship operation and the Philippines‚Äô leading international trading gateway.

It is close to the villages of Legacy, Pentre Bychan and Johnstown and is overlooked by Ruabon Mountain. The village name is also applied to a larger electoral ward, whose population at the 2011 Census was 4,842. History The Welsh word ponc, plural ponciau, means \\"bank\\" or \\"hillock\\", and the village probably takes its name from the large number of spoil tips which formerly covered the area. The village name was spelt using the form \\"Ponkey\\" until 1932, when the villagers convened a meeting to petition for its change to Ponciau, feeling the earlier spelling to be ugly in addition to inaccurately representing Welsh language phonetics.Rhos Herald, 13 Sep 1932Wrexham Leader, 30 Sep 1932 While this was based on a belief that \\"Ponkey\\" was an anglicised spelling, it in fact probably reflected a local pronunciation of the word in the dialect of Denbighshire, where the word ending -au was pronounced -e or -ey.Owen, H. and Gruffydd, K. (2017) Place-Names of Flintshire, p.182 Ponciau grew up around coal and iron ore mining and ironfounding. Iron ore was mined nearby at Llwyneinion. A coal pit was recorded here in 1757, with a lease on land being taken out by the great industrialist John Wilkinson, while the Ponciau ironworks is thought to have been started in 1807 by Thomas Jones of Gardden.Transactions of the Denbighshire Historical Society, vol 14, 173 A second ironworks was commenced nearby at Aberderfyn in the same period. Houses were built nearby, with little regard for planning, to house the workers. At Brynydd, close to the Royal Oak public house, was the former site of typical very basic, one room, terraced, workers' houses. Nonconformist chapels, some built in the distinctive 'Ruabon Red' brick. Ponciau and Rhosllanerchrugog previously had more than 150 public houses but the majority of those have closed. The Colliers Arms and Horse & Jockey still remain. One of the main streets in Ponciau is Chapel Street, which once contained a large number of nonconformist chapels: the Ponciau area had been one of the main centres of the 1859 and 1904-5 Welsh religious revivals. Several chapels remain in use. Many of the old buildings in the village are made from distinctive 'Ruabon Red' bricks, the product of local clays from the Ruabon Brick and Terracotta Company. Ponciau ward has one of the largest populations (4,486) of Wrexham County Borough. The ward is described as \\"The Ponciau North, Ponciau South and Rhos wards of the Community of Rhosllanerchrugog and the Aberoer and Pentrebychan wards of the Community of Esclusham\\" in the OPSI document Statutory Instrument 1998 No. 3142. 29% of households do not own a car. A section of the ward boundary follows the path of the River Clywedog. The Ponciau Banks The Ponciau Banks, earlier known as the Ponkey Banks, were an area of old coal spoil heaps covering around 18 acres adjacent to the village.Holland, Youth in European Labour Camps, 1939, p.30 In the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century, the area was used for unofficial 'outcropping' by local miners. These workings were opened particularly during the miners' strike in 1921 and the 1926 lockout, when as many as 50 such pits were operating, to the concern of local union officials.McIlroy, Campbell and Gildart, Industrial Politics and the 1926 Mining Lockout, 2004, p.164 These pits were later capped by the National Coal Board to leave of land being sold in 1932 for the sum of ¬£500 to be re- developed as a park. Much of the landscaping of the park to the form that can be seen today was organised by the Miner's Institute Committee. The first sod was cut in June 1932, with the work being carried out by 50 local volunteers along with international students. Ruabon Mountain behind. Edward, Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Ponciau Banks in May 1934 to view the progress. In 1935 the laying of the football pitch was completed and the local team, Rhos Aelwyd, have used this pitch for a number of years. The Second World War temporarily halted the reclamation works but in 1950 the works re-commenced. In the interim, the Ponciau Banks were used as the site of the \\"austerity\\" National Eisteddfod of 1945. The park has been the site of many events, including the Gorsedd stone circle from the 1961 Eisteddfod. The Ponciau Banks park was refurbished by Wrexham County Borough Council in 2009 using National Lottery funding. The development added a user centre and improved recreational and sports facilities, including tennis courts, bowling greens, skateboarding facilities, a BMX cycle track and a children's play area. Ponciau Park, WCBC Transport In 1861 the Great Western Railway constructed an industrial branch line from Garden Lodge Junction, north of Ruabon, to the furnaces at Ponciau and Aberderfyn, which was later extended to Legacy. By 1901 this branch had been connected to the newly extended branch line from Froncysyllte via Acrefair, Plasbennion, Wynn Hall and Rhosllannerchrugog to Legacy. The Ponkey Branch, as it was then known, had a short lived passenger service between 1905 and 1915 with halts at Fennant Road, Aberderfyn and Ponkey (Ponciau) Crossing. Since the closure of passenger services on this lines the village has relied on road transport. Language 37% of the population of Ponciau speak Welsh (per the 2001 Census).

Note that there are two archers riding in the chariot, one of them having the reins tied around his body to free his hands. Archers in a chariot could use strong infantry bows, but while moving the undamped shaking lessened the ability to aim at specific targets The first depictions of four- wheeled wagons pulled by semi-domesticated onagers and other available animals come from the Sumerians. Against infantry these fast chariots used tactics of wearing down the enemy by missile fire, deploying heavy troops and running down enemies. The next step was towards faster chariots with spoke-wheels. Lighter wheels made lighter constructions possible. This made it feasible to outrun light infantry and other chariots. Additionally, the development of short composite bows made it a devastating weapon.Bronze Age War Chariots By Nic Fields, Brian Delf Slingers and javeliners, who could counterattack and protect the other troops, had no armor protection or shield discipline. They were skirmishers, keeping out of enemy range. But the moving chariots showering them with arrows were difficult to hit so they were rendered helpless against these. The role and tactics of war chariots are often compared to tanks in modern warfare but this is disputed with scholars pointing out that chariots were vulnerable and fragile, required a level terrain while tanks are all-terrain vehicles, and thus not suitable for use in the way modern tanks have been used as a physical shock force. Chariots, carts and wagons still had the disadvantage of using more than one horse per transported soldier. Riders achieved supremacy through greater manoeuvreability than chariots in the 1st millennium BCE, as soon as the domesticated horse had been bred large enough to carry an armed man. Chariot and elephant warfare The chariot was restricted to terrains with level ground and plenty of space. It was the core of most cavalries, and developed into shock-troops and commanding centers. Then it was replaced by the war elephant with its supreme abilities in mel√©e. Agile infantry and early troops on horseback provided them protection and additional fighting power. =Light and medium chariots= There were two different ways for light chariots to operate on the battlefield. One was to have on each chariot one warrior/archer and one driver/shieldbearer. Apart from the shield, both crewmen were fully armored and their horses were barded. The archer used a composite bow, of superior power and range, shooting heavy bronze-pointed arrows which were capable of piercing armor and transfixing a man. Disciplined companies of chariots used hit-and-run tactics to wear down enemy forces, pulling into range, stopping to shoot a volley or three, then wheeling away before the enemy could retaliate. The other method was using melee weapons. Chariots could terrorize and scatter an enemy force by charging, threatening to run over enemy foot soldiers and attacking them with a variety of short range weapons, such as javelin, spear and axe. Light chariots could be dismantled and carried across unfavorable terrain which heavier types could not, which enhanced their efficiency for warfare. The Celtic chariot (essedum) was the longest lasting to be used in battles. It had a light and agile structure. A heavily armoured warrior stood on a small platform with two independent- running spoked wheels. His charioteer sat on a thick rope net connecting the platform to the horses. It could quickly carry the nobleman into battle and evacuate him in case of trouble. His preferred way of fighting was close combat. It was used on the Continent from the 700 BCE to 100 BCE and in Britain and Ireland until the year 200 CE. This tactic is similar to the dismounted men-at-arms or modern mechanized infantry today. =Heavy chariots for shock-troops= These were, until the advent of the war elephant, the only cavalry shock-troops available. Usually they were employed beside troops on horseback. Up to four men stood on a chariot, wielding polearms and close combat weapons. Javelins and bows were employed for range fighting. This chariot was a heavy construction and moved relatively slowly. Light infantry could keep up with them. The momentum of this heavy chariot was sufficient to break through enemy formations, causing an effect similar to heavy cavalry with lances. Some generals, such as Cyrus II and Darius III of Persia and Mithridates of Pontus attached scythes to their chariot forces' wheels, in the further hope of breaking up enemy formations. Historically, however, this tactic had at best mixed success, either because the horses would not charge directly into closely packed formations or because the opposing force would simply stand far enough apart from each other to avoid the scythes and then pull out the drivers as they rode through the gaps created. =Indian chariots and war elephants= Indian chariots combined the security of a chariot with the impact of a war elephant. By this time, infantry had learned to avoid chariots by forming passages and then attacking them in the back. The elephant introduced a new danger to an enemy formation, being equally dangerous for the infantry from the front or behind. The chariots could relatively securely follow the elephants and assist with arrowfire into the gaps. After the Greeks had their first contact in the battle of Gaugamela, this new tactic soon totally substituted chariots among shock-troops around the Mediterranean. Polybius tells that the Asian elephant \\"Suru\\" was the last one surviving after Hannibal\`s passage over the Alps. The Indian chariots were supplanted by skirmishers with range weapons. The higher density of shots and better aiming of infantry upgraded this weapon system. Elephants were used for frontal assaults against heavy infantry and for massive flanking maneuvers. They could reach a top speed of 30 km/h. Depending on the grade of their equipment it was now possible for cheaper light infantry to stand their ground against their heavy counterpart. The moving of an elephant through most battle formations seemed at first unstoppable.

Population: It was previously known as Porechye (until 1918). History The area was settled in the prehistory, and, as the Western Dvina always has been an important waterway, there are multiple archaeological sites in the district. The fortress of Porechye () is first mentioned in 1499, and since 1514 it belonged to the Grand Duchy of Moscow, at the border with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1580, after the Livonian War, the area was transferred to Poland, where it was included into Vitebsk Voivodeship. In 1667, according to the Truce of Andrusovo, it was transferred back to Russia. Subsequently Porechye developed as an important trading post since it was located at the intersection of roads connecting Saint Petersburg with Kiev and Moscow with Riga. The Kasplya was navigable until mid-19th century, and Porechye sent ships to Riga. Later, it lost its trade important, since the Kasplya became more shallow, and the railway between Moscow and Riga went via Velikiye Luki, far from Porechye. Porechye in 1858 In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Smolensk Governorate and remained there until 1929, with the exception of the brief periods between 1713 and 1726, when it belonged to Riga Governorate, and between 1775 and 1796, when Smolensk Governorate was transformed into Smolensk Viceroyalty. In 1776, Porechye was granted a town status, and Porechsky Uyezd with the center in Porechye was established. On 19 November 1918, Porechye was renamed Demidov, to commemorate the bolshevik Yakov Demidov, who was the chairman of the Uyezd Communist Party Committee and was killed during the Russian Civil War. Porechsky Uyezd was renamed Demidovsky Uyezd. In 1927, Demidovsky Uyezd was abolished. On 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Demidovsky District with the administrative center in Demidov was established. The district belonged to Smolensk Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 27 September 1937 Western Oblast was abolished and split between Oryol and Smolensk Oblasts. Demidovsky District was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. Between 1941 and September 1943, during WWII, the district was occupied by German troops. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Demidov serves as the administrative center of Demidovsky District.Resolution #261 As an administrative division, it is, together with four rural localities, incorporated within Demidovsky District as Demidovskoye Urban Settlement. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Demidovsky Municipal District.Law #131-z Economy =Industry= In Demidov, there are enterprises of timber and construction industries. =Transportation= Paved roads connect Demidov with Smolensk, with Nevel via Velizh, and with Rudnya. There are also local roads with bus traffic originating from Demidov. The closest railway station is in Rudnya, on the railway connecting Smolensk with Vitebsk. Culture and recreation A couple of dozens of 18-19th century buildings survived; they are designated cultural monuments. One of them is the Dormition Church, built between 1852 and 1861. Several monuments to soldiers and civilians killed during the Russian Civil war and during WWII has been also designated historic monuments. References =Notes= =Sources=  External links *Mojgorod.ru.

The line was the first significant railway in Australia, and was opened by the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company, to carry passengers arriving in Victoria at Station Pier, and to alleviate the high cost of shipping goods using small vessels up the Yarra River to Melbourne. In 1987, the line was converted to light rail, and it is now served by tram route 109. Construction Work began on laying the railway in March 1853, under the supervision of the company's Engineer-in-Chief James Moore. Trains were ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company, of the United Kingdom, but the first train was locally built by Robertson, Martin & Smith, because of shipping delays. Australia's first steam locomotive was built in ten weeks and cost ¬£2,700. Opening The line was opened in September 1854 (three years after the discovery of gold at Ballarat) and ran for 4 km from the Melbourne (or City) Terminus (on the site of modern-day Flinders Street station), crossing the Yarra River via the Sandridge Bridge, to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne). The opening of the line occurred during the period of the Victorian gold rush - a time when both Melbourne and Victoria undertook massive capital works, each with its own gala opening. The inaugural journey on the Sandridge line was no exception. According to the Argus newspaper's report of the next day: \\"Long before the hour appointed ... a great crowd assembled round the station at the Melbourne terminus, lining the whole of Flinders Street\\". Lieutenant-Governor Charles Hotham and Lady Hotham were aboard the train - which consisted of two first class and one second class carriages - and were presented with satin copies of the railway's timetable and bylaws. The trip took 10 minutes, none of the later stations along the line having been built. On arriving at Station Pier (onto which the tracks extended), it was hailed with gun-salutes by the warships HMS Electra and HMS Fantome. Subsequent history By March 1855, the four engines ordered from the UK were all in service, with trains running every half-hour. They were named Melbourne, Sandridge, Victoria, and Yarra. The line was taken over by the Government of Victoria in 1878, to become part of Victorian Railways. The line was electrified in the 20th century. Closure Looking towards Port Melbourne from the Swallow Street level crossing, the railway signals have been removed and have been replaced with signals resembling traffic signals for the trams Along with the St Kilda railway line, the conversion the line to light rail was first announced on 13 January 1983, by the Victorian state government, with cost estimates at the time of around $6 million. The line was closed on 10 October 1987, three months after the closure of the St Kilda railway line. The last service departed the station at 18.03, with freight services to Montague continuing until 16 October of the same year. The line reopened as part of the Melbourne tram network on 18 December 1987. Melbourne tram route 109 now operates on the converted track. The section from Southbank Junction to Port Melbourne was converted to light rail, requiring the conversion from broad gauge used by the Melbourne rail network to tram track, as well as reducing the overhead voltage from 1,500 V DC to 600 V DC required for the trams. Additionally, low level platforms were built on the sites of the former stations to accommodate the trams which contained steps to street level. Low floor trams have since been introduced to the route. Line guide Bold stations are termini.

History According to Malone (Life of Dryden, Prose Work. i - p. 484) this drink was invented by Col. Francis Negus (d.1732), a British courtier (commissioner for executing the office of Master of the Horse from 1717 to 1727, then Master of the Buckhounds). James Boswell refers to it repeatedly in his London Journal. Negus is also referred to in Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront√´, when Jane drinks it on arrival at Thornfield Hall. Jane Austen mentions it as part of the fare at a ball in Mansfield Park. In Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront√´, Catherine is given it at Thrushcross Grange by the Lintons; it appears in several works by Charles Dickens, namely Sketches by Boz, The Pickwick Papers, A Christmas Carol (during the party at Fezziwig's), Dombey and Son, David Copperfield and Bleak House; in Harriette Wilson's Memoirs and Grace Dalrymple Elliott's Journal of My Life During the French Revolution; and in John Buchan's Midwinter. Anthony Trollope in The Small House at Allington portrays the rustic Earl de Guest's violent disgust at the thought of the drink. Negus makes a number of appearances as a tonic in The Forsyte Saga by John Galsworthy and in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels and a similar reference is made in Written in My Own Heart's Blood by Diana Gabaldon. In Death Comes to Pemberley by P.D. James, it is said to be added to a white soup.

It is also an electoral ward to Conwy County Borough Council and Llandudno Town Council. It is also part of the parish of Llanrhos. History Land near Craig-y-Don was owned by the Mostyn family who built a manor house in Gloddaeth (now St David‚Äôs College). The present house dates from the 16th century. The Mostyns also built a windmill at Hen Dwr, which later became the Bodafon Mountain Beacon, used as part of a warning system in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1848, landowner Thomas Williams named Craig-y-Don after his home at Beaumaris. From 1850 to 1880, the area was used for sand and clay mining with lime kilns on Nant y Gamar. The first modern house in Craig- y-Don was Ascot House built in 1870 on the eastern corner of what is now Carmen Sylva Road. From 1885, the area was developed as a suburb of LLandudno.  Amenities  The suburb includes the eastern half of Llandudno Bay and its promenade starting at the roundabout on the Parade and comprising: East Parade, Craig-y-Don Parade, Bedford Crescent and the Colwyn Road through to the Little Orme to Penrhyn Bay. Properties on the Parade include hotels and residential or retirement flats beyond which on Colwyn Road are Bodafon Fields and the Craigside residential district. Opposite Bodafon Fields at the end of the promenade is a large paddling pool for children with a beach cafe and public facilities. The parade is paralleled by Mostyn Broadway and Mostyn Avenue, the latter with Queen's Road forms the local shopping centre. Queen's Road (named in honour of Queen Victoria) leads from the promenade through to the pleasant residential area of Craig-y-Don where Roumania Drive and several other streets are named in memory of the visit to Llandudno in 1890 of Carmen Sylva (Queen Elisabeth of Romania). On the hillside above Queen's Road is the North Wales Medical Centre, built in 1902 as Lady Forester's Convalescent Home (in memory of the 3rd Baron Forester) and since 1977 offering private medical treatment. Queen's Road continues to join Conway Road (leading to Llanrhos church) and Wormhout Way the A470 road leading to Llandudno Junction and the A55 road to Holyhead and Chester. The Church in Wales parish church of St. Paul on Mostyn Broadway was built in 1893/95 as a memorial to Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence on the corner of Clarence Road, which forms a junction with Mostyn Avenue. Other churches include Saint David's English Methodist church and Bethania Welsh Presbyterian church, both on Mostyn Avenue. Governance Craig-y-Don was an electoral ward to Gwynedd County Council, in the Borough of Aberconwy, between 1989 and 1996. Since 1995 the Craig-y-Don ward has elected two county councillors to Conwy County Borough Council. At the 1995 and 1999 elections the ward elected a Liberal Democrat and a Conservative Party councillor, though subsequently elected Independent candidates. and four town councillors to Llandudno Town Council. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 3,424. References *Ivor Wynne Jones. Llandudno Queen of Welsh Resorts Landmark, Ashbourne Derbyshire 2002 .

Early career He began his career as an apprentice with Bournemouth, turning professional and making his league debut in the 1980‚Äì81 season. After only one further league appearance for Bournemouth, he dropped out of league football, joining Dagenham. He later joined Walthamstow Avenue, from whom he joined Torquay United on a free transfer in March 1984. His only league appearance for the Gulls came during the 1983‚Äì84 season, a 2‚Äì1 defeat away to Hartlepool United on 17 March. Later career In 1984, Bailey moved to Grays Athletic. He subsequently joined Wealdstone from Wembley and in August 1989, returned to league football with Exeter City, again on a free transfer. His career took off, quickly establishing himself in the side, and after 64 league games, in which he scored two goals, he moved to Reading in December 1990 for a fee of ¬£50,000 as the first signing under new owner John Madejski. In his first season and a half at Reading, he played 50 league games, scoring twice. However, out of the first team at the beginning of the 1992‚Äì93 season, he was loaned to Fulham making three league appearances. Still unable to break back into the Reading line-up, he returned to Exeter City on a free transfer in December 1992, and quickly re-established himself at St. James Park. In the summer of 1997, he was released after 152 further league appearances in which he scored four goals. He joined Farnborough Town, beginning a journey around various non-league sides, quickly moving on to Slough Town in the 1997 close season. He remained at Slough until the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season, scoring one goal in the FA Trophy, but was one of many players sacked during a summer that saw Slough in deep financial trouble and eventually voted out of the Conference. He joined Telford United on a short- term contract on 21 August 1998, with the emphasis on the short-term. He moved to Forest Green Rovers in September 1998, playing in the 1999 FA Trophy final, at which time \\"Non-League on the Net\\" reported that he was based in London, where he owned his own fitness centre. In the close-season of 1999 he was released by Forest Green, joining Welling United on 29 July 1999. \\"The Kentish Times\\" linked him with moves to Basingstoke Town in December 1999, and Crawley Town in January 2000, however he remained at Welling and was released in the summer of 2000. In September 2000 he returned on a free transfer to play for Forest Green Rovers. In December 2000, he left Forest Green for a second time, moving to Aylesbury United, though he stayed only a few months at Aylesbury, moving to Grays Athletic in February 2001. He later played for Weston-super- Mare before joining Bath City in March 2002. He was released at the end of the season and joined Redbridge from where he joined Weymouth in November 2002, playing regularly until the end of the season. He was without a club from August 2003 to November 2003 when he joined Chippenham Town. He later played for Stansted from where he joined Chesham United in December 2005, playing nine times until mid-February. He later joined Ware. In March 2008 he was coach at Potters Bar Town.

New Institute building in G√∂ttingen, built in 2013 and occupied in 2014. MPS is a part of the Max Planck Society, which operates 80 research facilities in Germany. Over the last five years, members of the Institute have each year published about 270 articles in international journals and books and given 360 conference presentations.  Research  MPS is organised in three departments: * Sun and Heliosphere * Planets and Comets * Solar and Stellar Interiors In addition, since 2002 there is also an International Max Planck Research School. Subjects of research at the Institute are the various objects within the solar system. A major area of study concerns the Sun, its atmosphere, the interplanetary medium as influenced by the solar wind, as well as the impact of solar particles and radiation on the planets. The second area of research involves the interiors, surfaces, atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres of the planets and their moons, as well as of comets and asteroids. A further essential part of the activities at the Institute is the development and construction of instruments for space missions. The analysis and interpretation of the acquired datasets are accompanied by intensive theoretical work. Physical models are proposed and then tested and further developed with the aid of computer simulations. = The Sun and Heliosphere = The researchers at the MPS are studying the complete range of dynamic and often spectacular processes occurring on the Sun ‚Äì from the interior to the outer heliosphere. At the heart of this research is the magnetic field, which plays a decisive role in these processes. It is generated by gas currents in the interior of the Sun and causes, among other things, dark spots on the surface. Answers to the following questions are being sought: Why does the magnetic field change with an eleven-year cycle? How does the magnetic field produce the various structures on the Sun? How is the corona heated to many millions of degrees? Instruments developed by MPS aboard the space- craft SOHO and Ulysses have provided fundamentally new insights: Measurements of the ultraviolet spectrometer SUMER on board SOHO played a decisive role in recognising the significance of the magnetic field for dynamic processes and Ulysses measured the three-dimensional structure of the solar wind for the first time. Another important research topic at \\"The Sun and Heliosphere\\" department is the influence on the Earth due to the Sun's variable activity. Scientists are working intensively on the project STEREO, in which two identical spacecraft trace disturbances from the Sun to the Earth from different observational points, permitting predictions of potentially dangerous events. The physical processes involved in the origin and development of magnetic fields on the Sun take place on very small scales and therefore require measurements with very high spatial resolution. The balloon- borne telescope Sunrise, built under Institute leadership and flown in June 2009, was able to make out structures on the Sun's surface as small as 100 kilometers. Future projects will stress research into the physical causes of the Sun's variations. The ambitious Solar Orbiter Mission, based on a suggestion from the Institute, will see a probe approach our star to within a fifth of the Earth-Sun distance in order to investigate the magnetic field and its effects in the various layers of the solar atmosphere. = Planets and Comets = The Institute develops scientific instruments that fly with spacecraft to other planets. Highly specialized cameras have investigated the Saturn moon Titan, analyse the surface of Mars, and probe the clouds and winds of Venus. Microwave instruments determine the composition of atmospheres while infrared spectrometers examine surface rocks. A novel laser altimeter on board BepiColumbo will survey the topography of Mercury to within a meter. Further MPS instruments identify the atoms, electrons, and dust that move around the planets and impact their moons. Here the influence of the solar wind on the atmospheric gases is of particular interest. Theoretical studies and intensive computer simulations help to understand the processes both inside and surrounding the planets and to interpret the measured data. Models developed at MPS can describe, for example, interactions with the solar wind, the atmospheric dynamics, or the generation of the terrestrial magnetic field by means of currents deep in the iron core of our planet. In addition, the Institute has along tradition in cometary research. A major highlight was the camera developed at the Institute for the ESA spacecraft Giotto which delivered the first photographs ever of a comet's nucleus in 1986. A particular challenge was the development of numerous scientific instruments for the ESA Mission Rosetta, such as cameras, chemical analyzers, and essential components for the landing module Philae. Rosetta was launched in 2004, and matched orbits with the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014; a few months later, Philae landed on the comet's surface. The Institute has also provided the cameras for the NASA Dawn Mission, launched in 2007, to study two of the largest asteroids, Ceres and Vesta. = Helio- and Asteroseismology = The MPS is hosting the German Data Centre for the NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which has provided improved data on small scales of space and time to study the connections between the solar interior and magnetic activity in the solar atmosphere. A particularly exciting research activity at the MPS is the study of seismic waves in the vicinity of sunspots. The goal is to probe the subsurface structure of sunspots in three dimensions. Sunspot helioseismology is a challenging science as it requires modelling of the propagation of waves through magnetic structures; this can only be achieved by numerical simulations.  Scientific Projects  The institute has led, or been involved with, several international scientific projects such as: Solar Orbiter, SDO, Sunrise, STEREO, SOHO, Ulysses, BepiColombo, Exomars, Chandrayaan, Phoenix, Herschel, Dawn, Venus Express, SMART-1, SOFIA, Rosetta, Mars Express, Mars DFG, Cassini, Cluster, Helios, Galileo and Giotto. These contributions consist developing of the instruments and/or scientific research activities.  Degree programme  The MPI for Solar System Research offers the PhD programme \\"International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Solar System Science\\" together with the University of G√∂ttingen. The Solar System School offers a three-year course of study emphasizing actual research. The curriculum covers the entire area of the solar system from small bodies to the planets and the Sun. The goal is a broad, interdisciplinary, and solid scientific education, extended with courses in numerical physics, space technology, project management, scientific writing, and presentation techniques. There are always about 50 graduate students studying at the Solar System School. Two thirds are from abroad from over 30 different countries. About 30 percent are women.  History  Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research ‚Äì April 2006 The institute was founded by Walter Dieminger, who was head of the Luftwaffe test center at Rechlin at the M√ºritz from 1934 onwards. Erich Regener was cofounder. After being renamed to the \\"Centre for Radio Transmission\\" in 1943 and moving to Leobersdorf in 1944, the institute was united with the Fraunhofer institute from Freiburg at Ried in the Innkreis. After the war an Allied commission decided to move the institute to Lindau am Harz, where buildings of the Technical University of Hannover already existed. The convoy arrived on the 2nd and 3 March 1946. During 1948 the radio institute of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society was transferred from the Fraunhofer Society to the Max Planck Society and renamed \\"Institute for Ionosphere Research\\" in 1949. In 1950 the US Air Force paid for the construction of an ionospheric echolot system. The full transfer from Fraunhofer to Max Planck Society and the appointment of W. Dieminger as Director followed by the transfer of the Max Planck Institute of Stratosphere Research from Weisenau near Ravensburg to Lindau and another renaming to \\"Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy\\" completed the built up. Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Lindau, about a year before relocating ‚Äì March 2013. Erhard Keppler became the science lead in the first German satellite Azur (in cooperation with NASA) and with him a small group of scientists dedicated to work with satellites was established in Lindau. The institute was selected to build part of the instrumentation of the satellite which was launched in November 1969. Instruments of the Helios probes another German NASA cooperation were also built by the institute. After the retirement of W. Dieminger in 1974 the focus changed from atmospheric research to space research. The Institute participated in a long series of space missions like Galileo, Ulysses, Cluster, SOHO, Cassini-Huygens, Rosetta, Mars Express Venus Express and was responsible for most of the camera system of the Giotto mission to Comet Halley. The framing camera on board of the NASA mission Dawn to the asteroid belt was built at the institute. The institute was leading organization in the development, construction and scientific analysis of the sunrise (telescope). The telescope is solar telescope in the ultraviolet, that hangs from a high-altitude balloon. The five-day maiden flight was conducted in June 2009. The biggest changes to the Institute resulted from German unification with the retraction of two of the four directors of the institute in 1998 and 2004 after the retirement of Hagfors and Rosenbauer. The institute was renamed \\"Max Planck Institute of Solar System Research\\" in 2004 after the last director concerned with Ionosphere and Stratosphere research retired. The two remaining groups, of director S. Solanki dedicated to the sun and heliosphere and of U. Christensen dedicated to planets and comets form the present-day Institute. Since 2004, the institute has published the open access review journal Living Reviews in Solar Physics. The Max Planck Society decided to move the institute closer to the University of G√∂ttingen. In 2010, it was planned to relocate it to a new building next to the University's Faculty of Physics by April 2014. The move was completed in February 2014 and the opening ceremony held on 21 May of the same year.

Operation The line was opened by the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company in 1857. It ran for 4.5 kilometres from the Melbourne (or City) Terminus (on the site of modern-day Flinders Street station), crossing the Yarra River via the Sandridge Bridge, to branch off from the Port Melbourne line and after stopping at three stations along the line ‚Äî South Melbourne, Albert Park, Middle Park ‚Äî ending at St Kilda. For a short time early in the line's history, there was a short connection provided to the then Brighton line at Windsor, however this link was removed shortly after the direct link was provided to Bay Street from Richmond. The line was taken over by the Government of Victoria in 1878, to become part of Victorian Railways. The line was electrified in 1919. Closure B-class Melbourne tram on route 96 The line was originally to be closed in 1981, and replaced with buses as recommended in the Lonie Report. Plans were sufficiently advanced for Melbourne-Brighton Bus Lines to have taken delivery of six Volgren bodied Volvo B10M buses before it was decided to retain the rail service after much opposition.\\"Victorian Buses in the Eighties\\" Australian Bus Panorama 6/1 July 1990 page 13\\"Melbourne - Brighton Bus Lines\\" Australian Bus Panorama 8/4 December 1992 page 10 Along with the Port Melbourne line, the conversion the line to light rail was first announced on 13 January 1983, by the Victorian state government. Cost estimates at the time was of around $6 million. The line was officially closed on 31 July 1987, and reopened as part of the Melbourne tram network on 21 November 1987. Melbourne tram route 96 now operates on the converted track. The section from Southbank Junction to St Kilda was converted to light rail, requiring the conversion from broad gauge used by the Melbourne rail network to tram track as well as reducing the overhead voltage from 1,500 V DC to 600 V DC required for the trams.

Schm√∂kel and his crimes have inspired national discussions of reforming the German justice system.  Early life  Schm√∂kel was born on August 19, 1962 in Strausberg, a suburb of what was then East Berlin, and was the son of a police officer. Schm√∂kel was known to practice zoophilia. He had been a psychiatric patient since early childhood, claims his grandparents are holocaust survivors, and has argued numerous times in court that he is entitled to rape and murder Germans, especially German children. Crimes and escapes In 1988 Schm√∂kel was sentenced to one and a half years imprisonment for the attempted rape of a 13-year-old. After escaping custody for a short time, he was sentenced to an additional ten months. In 1989, Schm√∂kel was released early as part of a partial amnesty. After his release, Schm√∂kel committed further crimes, including the rape of an eight-year-old. In 1993 he was convicted of four counts of sexual abuse by the district court of Frankfurt (Oder) for sexual abuse, and sentenced to five and a half years imprisonment in a psychiatric facility (Ger: Asklepios Klinikum Brandenburg). In 1994, Schm√∂kel escaped from the psychiatric facility; he then raped an eleven-year-old girl in Quitzerow and tried to kill her. For this Schm√∂kel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. In 1995, Schm√∂kel escaped again, but was arrested after one day. In 1996, he escaped again was arrested again three days later. In the spring of 1997, he escaped for a fifth time, but caught after a week police and relocated to the Neurippin State Clinic. There he broke out of prison again after six months, but was arrested the next day. As part of his therapy, Schm√∂kel was given the opportunity in April 2000 to move freely outside the detention center, accompanied by carers. On October 25, 2000, he was allowed a visit to his mother in Strausberg, and took the opportunity to escape, severely injuring his mother and accompanying guardian with knife wounds. On November 2, 2000, he killed a 60-year-old pensioner in a Strausberg colony in which he was hiding, and stole the victim's car. Hundreds of police in Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland searched for the fugitive, and successfully located Schm√∂kel's escape vehicle and hideout in Bautzen. Schm√∂kel was apprehended in the town of Saritsch near Bautzen, East Saxony on November 6 and sentenced to life in prison to be followed by indefinite security detention (Sicherheitsverwahrung) in 2002.\\"Der Mordprozess gegen Frank Schm√∂kel beginnt\\" Welt OnlineSpiegel Online A final appeal was denied by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany in 2003.Pressemitteilung des BGH vom 20.

It is named in honor of Audrey and Theodor Seuss Geisel. Theodor is better known as children's author Dr. Seuss. The building's distinctive architecture, described as occupying \\"a fascinating nexus between brutalism and futurism\\", has resulted in its being featured in the UC San Diego logo and becoming the most recognizable building on campus. The library was designed by William Pereira and opened in 1970 as the Central Library. It was renovated in 1993 and rededicated as the University Library Building, and renamed Geisel Library in 1995. The UC San Diego Library consists of Geisel Library and the Biomedical Library Building, with off-campus locations at Scripps Archives and Library Annex, the Trade Street Storage Annex, and the UC Southern Regional Library Facility. Geisel Library is located in the center of the UC San Diego campus. It houses over 7 million volumes to support the educational and research objectives of the university. It also contains the Mandeville Special Collections and Archives, which houses the Dr. Seuss Collection, which contains original drawings, sketches, proofs, notebooks, manuscript drafts, books, audio and videotapes, photographs, and memorabilia. The approximately 8,500 items in the collection document the full range of Dr. Seuss's creative achievements, beginning in 1919 with his high school activities and ending with his death in 1991. The head of the library system is designated the Audrey Geisel University Librarian, currently Erik T. Mitchell.  History  In 1958, Roger Revelle's efforts to establish an Institute of Science and Engineering adjacent to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography were spearheaded by his desire to immediately construct a science and library building on the present Revelle College site. When the university was eventually constructed, university librarian Melvin Voigt devised a plan to purchase books for the three new UC campuses: UC San Diego, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Irvine. The first Science and Engineering Library in Urey Hall satisfied the science-focused school's needs. However, as faculty recruits began to found social science and humanities departments, it became clear to Chancellor John Semple Galbraith that the time had come to establish the campus's main library collections. One of the conditions of Galbraith's acceptance of the UCSD chancellorship had been that UCSD would house one of the three great libraries of the UC system. To accomplish this end, he formed a committee which commissioned architect William L. Pereira to prepare a master plan for the University Center and its focal point, the Central Library. Pereira's plan called for the University Center to be moved north and east, along with the proposed library building. This resulted in a revision of the campus long- range development plan: the three \\"clusters\\" of four colleges each would be more compact, allowing for an auxiliary library in each cluster. The proposed building was designed around a spheroidal tower, to maximize the stacks area that could be accessed in a given time from the center. This tower was to be situated atop a main level containing the staff and public areas of the library. The chosen site allowed for future expansions to step downwards into the canyon. Construction of the first of three increments began in July 1968; the two main floors were constructed first to form the base of the structure. This allowed for the placement of scaffolding to support construction of the tower. The Central University Library building's topping-out ceremony took place in December 1969 and its formal dedication was in March 1971. Central Library, combined with the original Scripps Library, the Humanities-Library building (now Galbraith Hall) in Revelle College, and the Biomedical Library (built in 1969), was able to support and represent the growing university for years. In 1990, construction began on a two-story, 136,850 square foot subterranean expansion of the main level. The project included renovation of the existing facility to comply with safety standards and cost $38 million, provided by California's 1988 Proposition 78. The expansion, designed by Gunnar Birkerts, was completed in February 1993. In 1995, La Jolla resident Audrey Geisel donated $20 million to the UCSD Library, supplementing her 1991 donation of $2.3 million worth of her husband Theodor Seuss Geisel's original works. In exchange, the library was renamed Geisel Library. Between the first and second renovations of Geisel Library, several other UCSD library facilities were also renovated or closed. The biomedical library received a $17 million, 43,454 square foot expansion in 2006. In 2011, the SIO library, the IR/PS library, the Hillcrest Medical Center library, and the Center for Library Instruction and Computing Services (CLICS) were closed and their collections consolidated into Geisel Library due systemwide budget cuts. In 2015, university officials announced that Geisel Library would begin to undergo its second renovation. This renovation includes construction of a caf√© named Audrey's on the main level of the library. However, Geisel Library's current name has come under increasing criticism over the last few years due to increasing awareness of Theodor Geisel's own expression of anti-Blackness, Orientalism, and other racially-charged beliefs through cartoons and other work that he produced throughout the majority of his career. Although Theodor Geisel did come to renounce his more racially offensive characterizations during an interview for his alma mater of Dartmouth College, there has been no official response by UC San Diego to students requesting a name change.  Design  Geisel Library seen from the canyon The distinctive original building was designed in the late 1960s by William Pereira to sit at the head of a canyon. The building's arches, in combination with the design of the individual floors, are intended to look like hands holding up a stack of books. William Pereira & Associates prepared a detailed report in 1969. Pereira originally conceived a steel-framed building, but this was changed to reinforced concrete to save on construction and maintenance costs. This change of material presented an opportunity for a more sculptural design. It was envisioned that future additions to the original building would form terraced levels around the tower base descending into the canyon. In keeping with the original master plan, these are \\"deliberately designed to be subordinated to the strong, geometrical form of the existing library.\\"Link text , additional text. Within its two subterranean levels are the other library sections as well as study spaces and computer labs. The building has been described by Architecture Daily as occupying \\"a fascinating nexus between brutalism and futurism\\". Its tower rises 8 stories to a height of 110 ft (33.5 m). The five upper stories of the tower house collections, individual study space, and group study rooms. READ/WRITE/THINK/DREAM seen from the library interior The library entrance is marked by John Baldessari's READ/WRITE/THINK/DREAM, an artwork which is part of the Stuart Collection. Geisel Library also features a life-size bronze statue of its namesake and his most famous character, The Cat in the Hat, on the forum level. = Snake Path = Snake Path as seen from Geisel The east side of the Geisel forum is literally and symbolically connected to Warren Mall by the Stuart Collection work Snake Path, Alexis Smith's 560-foot-long slate tile path that winds towards the library. Its route passes a giant granite Paradise Lost and a small garden of fruit trees. The granite book is engraved with the excerpt \\"Then Wilt Thou Not Be Loth To Leave This Paradise, But Shall Possess A Paradise Within Thee, Happier Far.\\" = Third floor = One unusual feature of the library is that the lower levels are numbered 1 and 2, and the upper floors numbered 4 to 8. That has given rise to several fanciful explanations for why the third floor is apparently sealed off and not accessible from elevators or steps. One of the more popular stories is that the building's design had not taken into account the eventual weight of books in the library, so the third floor has of necessity been left empty, a common urban legend, associated at different times with many other university libraries. In reality, the \\"missing\\" third floor is actually the open/outside forum. There is no other third floor, blocked off or otherwise. It is simply reinforced concrete and an emergency exit that helps students from the 4-8 floors get out without having to go to the second floor. The \\"third floor\\" is actually two separate levels. The third floor landings in the public stairwells open to the concrete platform outside the library which was originally intended to be used for sculpture displays, acoustic music, impromptu outdoor conversations, an open public meeting area and poetry readings. Potential theft of library materials and the risks attributed to the potential theft of UCSD's rare private collections of literature and art caused the doors to third floor to be protected, to be used only in emergencies or by building personnel to conduct transfer of equipment to the central core directly to avoid disrupting library operations. The \\"second\\" third floor's landing is numbered as floor \\"3.5\\" and consists of utility connections and wiring to the upper levels. There are no accessways beyond the stairwell doors of floor 3.5; they are locked utility rooms, essentially for maintenance and repair. The doors to the 3rd floor open outwards from the stairwells, and the 3.5 floor doors open inwards towards the central core. The Central Forum, the 3rd floor, was originally intended to be a formal area of the library but outside the interior to avoid disturbing library patrons or library operations.  Collections  The UC San Diego Library provides access to over 7 million digital and print works. Most of its works are organized into collections by subject, but the library also maintains some special collections and collections of distinction. The Mandeville Special Collections and Archives include: *American Institute of Wine & Food Culinary Collection *Archive for New Poetry *Baja California Collection *California, San Diego, & the History of the West *Don Cameron Allen Renaissance Collection *Dr. Seuss Collection: The Dr. Seuss Collection comprises the work of Theodor Seuss Geisel, otherwise known as Dr. Seuss. The collection contains roughly 8,500 items which include: \\"original drawings, sketches, proofs, notebooks, manuscript drafts, books, audio- and videotapes, photographs, and memorabilia\\". The Dr. Seuss collection is considered too fragile to be easily accessible. The collection is only open to researchers who have received permission from the director of special collections. *East Asia Collection *Hill Collection of Pacific Voyages: The Hill Collection of Pacific Voyages was donated to the University of California, San Diego in 1974 by Kenneth E. and Dorothy V. Hill. The collection is considered to be one of the finest for early voyages and discovery in the Pacific. It contains more than 2,000 items that date from the 16th to the mid-19th century. Some of the more interesting items include ship logs from whaling expeditions and records from botanists who made sea voyages. *The San Diego Technology Archive *Scripps Institution of Oceanography Collections *Southworth Spanish Civil War Collection *Tuzin Archive for Melanesian Anthropology *Twentieth-Century Science & Public Policy *UC San Diego Archives  Other library buildings  The southwest corner of the biomedical library The 2011 consolidation of the UC San Diego Library resulted in Geisel Library and the Biomedical Library building in the School of Medicine becoming the only remaining library buildings on campus.

Maxwell is credited with the introduction of the scavenger hunt and treasure hunt for use as party games in the modern era. Her radio program, Elsa Maxwell‚Äôs Party Line, began in 1942; she also wrote a syndicated gossip column. She appeared as herself in the films Stage Door Canteen (1943) and Rhapsody in Blue (1945), as well as co-starring in the film Hotel for Women (1939), for which she wrote the screenplay and a song. Biography In spite of the persistent rumor that Elsa Maxwell was born at a theater in Keokuk, Iowa, during a performance of the opera Mignon, she actually admitted late in life that the outlandish story was a fabrication that she went along with, since she was actually born at her maternal grandmother's home in the same town. Elsa was raised in San Francisco, where her father sold insurance and did freelance writing for the New York Dramatic Mirror. Maxwell never completed grammar school because her father did not believe in formal education; as a result, he tutored his daughter at home. Her interest in parties began when she was 12 years old and was told she would not be invited to a party because her family was poor. She developed a gift for staging games and diversions at parties for the rich, and began making a living devising treasure-hunt parties, come-as-your-opposite parties and other sorts, including a scavenger hunt in Paris in 1927 that inadvertently created disturbances all over the city. In Venice in the early 1920s, Maxwell attracted stars like Cole Porter, Tallulah Bankhead, No√´l Coward and Fanny Brice to Venice's Lido shoreline to enjoy its daytime amenities and nightly parties. Later, the principality of Monaco employed Maxwell's services to put it on the map as a tourist destination as she had done for the Lido. Maxwell and Porter were lifelong friends, and he mentioned her in several of his songs, including \\"I'm Throwing a Ball Tonight\\" from Panama Hattie (sung by Ethel Merman) and \\"I'm Dining with Elsa (and her ninety-nine most intimate friends).\\" She is also mentioned in Rodgers and Hart's \\"I Like to Recognize the Tune\\" from Too Many Girls, Irving Berlin's \\"The Hostess With the Mostes' on the Ball\\" from Call Me Madam and in \\"Listen, Cosette!\\" from Sherry! Elsa Maxwell, 1933 Returning to the U.S., Maxwell worked on movie shorts during the Depression, unsuccessfully. \\"Her imprimatur of social acceptability carried so much weight that the Waldorf Astoria gave her a suite rent-free when it opened in New York in 1931 at the height of the depression, hoping to attract rich clients because of her.\\" Following World War II, she gained an audience of millions as a newspaper gossip columnist. Beginning in 1942 she also hosted a radio program, Elsa Maxwell‚Äôs Party Line, for which Esther Bradford Aresty was a writer and producer. Maxwell was responsible for the success of ventriloquist Edgar Bergen. Bergen had been playing small theaters for 17 years; when he decided to ask for Maxwell's help, he was persistent enough in his telephone calls that Maxwell agreed to meet with him. When Bergen arrived, Maxwell asked him if he was a singer; Bergen replied that he was a ventriloquist and told her he wanted her to meet Charlie McCarthy. Charlie's meeting with Maxwell was an instant success; Maxwell asked crooner Rudy Vall√©e to find him a place on his radio program. Maxwell was a closeted lesbian who publicly condemned same-sex love despite enjoying an almost 50-year partnership with the Scottish singer Dorothy Fellowes-Gordon (\\"Dickie\\"). The two met in 1912 and remained together until death.The Spectator Magazine, December 2012 Maxwell took credit for introducing Rita Hayworth to Prince Aly Khan in the summer of 1948.Adrienne McLean Being Rita Hayworth, p. 91, Rutgers University Press, 2004 In 1953, Maxwell published a single issue of her magazine, Elsa Maxwell's Caf√© Society, which had a portrait of Zsa Zsa Gabor on the cover. Anne Edwards's biography of Maria Callas (Callas, 2001) and Peter Evans's biography of Aristotle Onassis both claim that Maxwell introduced Callas to Onassis.Peter Evans Nemesis, p. 44, Harper Collins, 2004 Edwards also claims that Maxwell fell obsessively in love with Callas, 40 years Maxwell's junior.Edwards, p. 159 Callas biographer Stelios Galatopoulos produced love letters from Maxwell written to Callas, who was less than receptive.Stelios Galatopoulos Maria Callas, Simon & Schuster, 1998 Maxwell told interviewer Mike Wallace in 1957: She died of heart failure in a Manhattan hospital. Maxwell's last public appearance came a week before her death. She attended the annual April in Paris Ball, which she had helped found, in a wheelchair. Fellowes-Gordon was Maxwell's sole heir.Time, November 22, 1963. \\"Only 100 gathered to say a final goodbye to the woman who had given thousands of parties for thousands of people, and few of the glittering names she had called 'dear' and 'darling' were on hand. One mourner there who didn't get much society-gossip-column attention was Dorothy Fellowes-Gordon. And to this longtime friend, the international party giver left her entire estate. It amounted to less than $10,000.\\" She is buried at Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, New York.Wilson, Scott.

Lyricist Tom Adair referenced Maxwell in the song \\"Will You Still Be Mine\\" (first recorded by Tommy Dorsey in 1941). The song's fourth chorus has the following lines: ‚ÄúWhen Elsa's parties are no fun / When FDR declines to run / When Eleanor of ‚ÄòMy Day‚Äô is done / Will you still be mine?‚Äù In The Second Confession by Rex Stout, published in September 1949, Nero Wolfe's assistant Archie Goodwin references Elsa Maxwell after being congratulated for helping a more slender woman out of the pool. Elsa Maxwell was the name of Higa Jiga's goat that was used to test the sweet potato brandy in the 1956 movie Teahouse of the August Moon, starring Marlon Brando and Glenn Ford. In an episode of I Love Lucy titled \\"Housewarming\\", which originally aired on April 1, 1957, Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) derisively refers to Betty Ramsey (Mary Jane Croft) as \\"the Elsa Maxwell of Westport\\". In The Spy Went Dancing by Aline, Countess of Romanones (1991), Elsa Maxwell is mentioned as being a society hostess who held \\"fabulous parties\\" in 1947 New York. Elsa Maxwell was also referred to by JFK impersonator Vaughn Meader on The First Family LP (1962). On Track 15, \\"Saturday Night, Sunday Morning,\\" Maxwell calls President Kennedy (Meader) to see if he and Jackie (Naomi Brossart) would be interested in going to a party she was hosting that evening. The President, however, politely declines because he is too embarrassed to admit that he and the First Lady have not already made Saturday night plans themselves.

The original Gaelic form was written as √ì Duirn√≠n or √ì Dorn√°in, possibly derived from the word dorn, which means fist. According to tracit.com, the Durnan family can trace their ancestors back to the ancient territories of Ireland between the 11th and 12th centuries, first appearing in ancient medieval records in Antrim. In Britain, the largest concentrations of people with this surname are around Argyll in Scotland and North West England. New world settlers include Nicholas Durnan who settled in Virginia in 1734; Charles Durnin, who settled in Newcastle in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1827; John Durnin arrived in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1868. The Durnan crest is a blue demi antelope; the coat of arms features a blue shield, with a silver chevron between three silver antelopes. Durnans in the United States The greatest concentrations of Durnans found today in the U.S. are located in Iowa and the Great Northwestern areas of Washington and Oregon. Durnans are found to lesser amounts in the Southwest, such as in and around Globe and Mesa, Arizona. There are some found in Upson county, Georgia. Many Durnans call parts of Canada home. Many Durnans in the U.S. can trace their roots back to a Stephen and Bridget Durnan. Stephen and Bridget are buried at Fairbank, Iowa. Many of their 14 children spread across the country and into Canada, most notably, two brothers, Ed and Bill, who left their boarding school in Chicago and followed the threshing crews out towards the Great Northwest. Many of the Durnans in Iowa are descended from Stephen and Bridget's son Charles who lived and farmed near Fairbank. His son Leo went on to have 19 children and these children have spread to Arizona, Illinois, and Georgia, as well as staying in Iowa. Thomas Durnan, Stephen's son, farmed near Oran for many years and is the father of Phil, Jim, Harry and Nellie Durnan. First cousins to Leo, Phil Durnan settled in the Ossian, Iowa area, Jim Durnan settled in Oelwein, Iowa and Harry settled in Gibbon, Minn. Regarding the Durnin variation, a story passed down is that Stephen arrived in America during the Great Famine of Ireland with a brother and that Stephen took the vowel A and the brother took the vowel I. There is a tombstone near the one for Stephen and Bridget that is shared and on it contains both the A and I variations of the name. The earliest Durnans known are the brothers Stephen (1833‚Äì1888) and Charles (1835‚Äì1881) they are believed to have had a sister married to a British soldier. It is also believed that the two brothers migrated to the United States (cir 1862) since their sister had inherited the family estate due to the restrictive English inheritance laws. Family tradition says they were from the town of Armagh in the county of Armagh in Ireland. Their parents are believed to have been Thomas Durnan and Kary McGan. Stephan and Charles emigrated from the port of Killybegs, County Donegal, Ireland. Charles' wife Ellen and their son Stephen accompanied them to the U.S., stopping in or near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where Thomas and Margaret Durnan lived with their 9 children. It is believed that Stephen and Charles entered the U.S. through the Port of Boston Massachusetts, although this cannot be confirmed as the records were destroyed by fire in 1894. Although the record and names of their children, taken from the will of Stephen Durnan dated July 7, 1888 shows the 12 children listed, at the gravesite in Immaculate Conception Cemetery, Fairbank, Iowa.

Early life and career Blake was one of four siblings born to a nurse and a soldier who fought in both world wars, ultimately becoming a major. His father suffered a significant financial setback by the time his son was ten. Blake left school at the age of 17 and gained employment at the Hackney Gazette. Further jobs at an evening newspaper in Luton and a news agency followed. Beginning as a pop columnist for the London Evening News in the early 1970s, his journalism developed into a column titled \\"Ad Lib\\", a gossip column and lifestyle guide. It survived the merger of the Evening News with the Evening Standard. In 1976, he co-wrote the book Up and Down with the Rolling Stones, the memoirs of 'Spanish Tony' Sanchez, friend of and assistant to Keith Richards. Blake was the first editor of 'Bizarre', a column in The Sun launched in May 1982 concentrating on celebrity gossip. Launched when Kelvin MacKenzie was editor of The Sun, his immediate successor in the post was Piers Morgan. Blake moved to the Daily Mirror and launched a pop column called \\"White Hot Club\\". He was the newspaper's Assistant Editor between 1984 and 1988. In 1988, Blake became editor of the Sunday People. It was a position he quickly came to dislike. \\"I had to wear a suit and I was stuck in an office on my own with a secretary outside\\", he told Emine Saner in 2004. In his first discussion with the Peoples owner, Robert Maxwell, he was told to cut costs: \\"So the very first job I did wasn't some great creative story or hiring a columnist, it was to make a hit list of people I was supposed to fire\\". Blake's post as editor of the Sunday People was short-lived. Maxwell hastily announced Blake was being appointed as president of the Mirror Group in the US during the period in 1989 when it was anticipated he would purchase the National Enquirer which lasted until the deal collapsed. In a 2004 interview he said he lost his job and Maxwell hid from him, but did receive a payoff equivalent to two years of his salary. Briefly, in 1990, Blake was a producer for Sky TV. John Blake Publishing He founded Blake Publishing in 1991 with his brother, David Blake. After an acrimonious dissolution of the original partnership in March 2002, John Blake went solo and founded John Blake Publishing. Six months later, he was joined by journalist Rosie Ries (later Virgo), who became the company's managing director. In 1998, the company published autobiographies by bareknuckle fighters Lenny McLean and Roy \\"Pretty Boy\\" Shaw. In 2004, Being Jordan by Katie Price was published by Blake after larger firms had rejected the book. While the advance to Price was ¬£10,000, the book, ghost written by Rebecca Farnworth, sold a million copies. \\"It's the kind of book bought by people who would find going into Hatchards or Waterstone's rather intimidating\\", Blake said in 2007. A scoop in a book entitled Dead Lucky, purporting to have discovered the missing (now presumed deceased) Lord Lucan had lived in Goa, India, quickly collapsed. The Sunday Telegraph editor Dominic Lawson published the story in September 2003, believing it to be \\"a rattling good yarn\\", but \\"inherently improbable\\". The dead \\"Jungly Barry\\" turned out to be one-time Northern folk singer named Barry Halpin. Blake initially stood by the book but, while it sold 20,000 copies, the remainder of the 60,000 print run were destroyed. Blake the following year described the incident as being his biggest error. In August 2008, On Her Majesty's Service a book that was about to be published by John Blake Publishing under the name of Ronald Evans, a former bodyguard of Sir Salman Rushdie, had a Declaration of Falsity made against it by a Judge in the High Court for the inclusion of 11 \\"serious falsehoods\\" defaming Rushdie. Rushdie did not seek any damages in his legal action. The first version of the book, which was serialised in The Mail on Sunday informing Rushdie of its existence, was rewritten and the original version's 4,000 print run was pulped. The company also publishes memoirs of football hooligans, including Cass by Cass Pennant, Massive Attack by Trevor Tanner and Undesirables by Manchester United hooligan Colin Blaney. Delays in paying royalties, apparently in breach of an obligation in 2,000 contracts, caused the publisher's authors to complain in the spring of 2016, Blamed on problems with a new computerised system intended to increase efficiency. Blake told The Bookseller that after \\"a slight hiccup\\", \\"virtually all\\" outstanding fees had been paid. The company was acquired by Bonnier Publishing in May 2016; the purchase price was not disclosed. The company published 110 books in 2015 and turnover was ¬£2,2 million. Blake remained in charge of the division. Both Blake and Virgo, plus their staff, left JBP in 2018 and joined Bonnier's Kings Road Publishing division whose list includes Blink Publishing, Lagom and 535, all of which issue adult non-fiction titles. Awards In 2005, the company received a 'Nibbie' national book award as Small Publisher of the Year. In 2010, the company won a second 'Nibbie' as well as the IPA Award for Independent Publisher of the Year.

Mineral rights can be separate from property ownership (see Split estate). Mineral rights can refer to sedentary minerals that do not move below the Earth's surface or fluid minerals such as oil or natural gas. There are three major types of mineral property; unified estate, severed or split estate, and fractional ownership of minerals.  Mineral estate  Owning mineral rights (often referred to as a \\"mineral interest\\" or a \\"mineral estate\\") gives the owner the right to exploit, mine, and/or produce any or all minerals they own. Minerals can refer to oil, gas, coal, metal ores, stones, sands, or salts. An owner of mineral rights may sell, lease, or donate those minerals to any person or company as they see fit. Mineral interests can be owned by private landowners, private companies, or federal, state or local governments. Sorting these rights are a large part of mineral exploration. A brief outline of rights and responsibilities of parties involved can be found here.  Types of mineral estate  = Unified estate = Unified estates, sometimes referred to as \\"fee simple\\" or \\"unified tenure\\" mean that the surface and mineral rights are not severed. = Severed/split estate = This type of estate occurs when mineral and surface ownership are separated. This can occur from prior ownership of mineral rights or is commonly performed when land is passed between family generations. Today corporations own a significant portion of mineral rights beneath private individuals. = Fractional ownership = Here a percentage of the mineral property is owned by two or more entities. This can occur when owners leave fractions of the rights to multiple children or grandchildren.  Severed/split estate  Mineral estates can be severed, or separated, from surface estates. There are two main avenues to mineral rights severance: the surface property may be sold and the minerals retained, or the minerals may be sold and the surface property retained, though the former is more common.Fambrough, J., 2009. Minerals, surface rights and royalty payments. Real Estate Center, Texas A&M; University, Technical Report 840 When mineral rights have been severed from the surface rights (or property rights), it is referred to as a \\"split estate.\\" In a split estate, the owner of the mineral rights has the right to develop those minerals, regardless of who owns the surface rights. This is because in United States law, mineral rights trump surface rights. The U.S. historical precedent for this severance roots from western expansion and The Land Ordinance Act of 1785 and The Northwest Ordinance Act of 1789 at the cost of dispossessed Natives. Severability was further reinforced by the Homestead Act of 1862 (OHA) and the 1862 Railroad Act. Agricultural patents and the California gold rush of 1848 began placing lands that were mineral abundant into private hands and furthered the precedent of mineral rights outweighing surface rights. This was a crucial step in the development of an economic system based largely on private incentives and market transactions. An early case involving a property dispute between a father and son involving ownership of coal veins in Pennsylvania is cited stating; ‚ÄúOne who has the exclusive right to mine coal upon a tract of land has the right of possession even as against the owner of the soil, so far as it is necessary to carry on mining operations.‚Äù (Turner v. Reynolds, 1854). A later case in Texas in 1862 set precedent by stating ‚Äúit is a well-established doctrine from the earliest days of the common law, that the right to the minerals thus reserved carries with it the right to enter, dig and carry them away.\\" (Cowan v. Hardeman, 1862). Some may argue that the U.S. justice system's enabling of this precedent is further exacerbated by industry lobbying which enables the status quo of favoring oil and gas development vs other innovations. This severability can create tension between mineral rights owners and surface rights owners if the surface rights owners do not want to allow the mineral rights owners to use their property to access their minerals. This is becoming ever more present in the light of recent unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) such as hydraulic fracturing due to technological advancement. Problems include water pollution, fluid storage issues and surface damages. These are especially common in the West Virginia gas wells of the Marcellus Shale. Often, companies will offer a surface rights owner a surface use agreement, which can provide financial compensation to the surface owner, or more commonly, offer some concessions on how the minerals are accessed. For example, some surface use agreements require the company to access the property from specific roads or points on the property. A major issue that involves fluid mineral rights include the \\"rule of capture\\" where minerals that can migrate beneath the Earth's surface can be extracted, even if the source was another person's mineral property. This claim is protected by the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation (BOGC) whose broader mandate is to promote conservation and prevent conflicts between mineral owners.  Major elements  The five elements of a mineral right are: # The right to use as much of the surface as is reasonably necessary to access the minerals # The right to further convey rights # The right to receive bonus consideration # The right to receive delay rentals # The right to receive royalties The owner of a mineral interest may separately convey any or all of the above-listed interests. Minerals may be possessed as a life estate, which does not permit a person to sell them, but merely that they own the minerals so long as they live. After this, the rights revert to a predesignated entity, such as a specific organization or person. It is possible for a mineral right owner to sever and sell an oil and gas royalty interest, while keeping the other mineral rights. In such case, if the oil lease expires, the royalty interest is extinguished, its purchaser has nothing, and the mineral owner still owns the minerals.  Mineral rights leasing  An owner of mineral rights may choose to lease those mineral rights to a company for development at any point. Signing a lease signals that both parties agree to the terms laid out in the lease. Lease terms typically include a price to be paid to the mineral rights owner for the minerals to be extracted, and a set of circumstances under which those minerals are to be extracted. For instance, a mineral rights owner might request that the company minimize any noise and light pollution when extracting the minerals. Leases are usually term-limited, meaning the company has a limited amount of time to develop the resources; if they do not begin development within that time-frame they forfeit their right to extract those minerals. The four components of mineral rights leasing are: # Ownership # Leasing # The Division Order # The Royalty Check = Ownership = There are three distinct but related aspects of ownership. They are: * Legal description * Net mineral acres * Ownership type = Ownership Types = Ownership of oil and gas interest are a bit more complicated than other types of real property, as there 4 main types, with different obligations to the owner of the interest. The four common types of mineral interest ownership in a well are: #Royalty Interest (RI): A percentage of production value that the mineral owner receives from oil & gas production as stated in the lease agreement. The royalty is paid by the lessee (producer) to the lessor (property owner) once the well is producing. Generally, the royalty interest owner is not required to pay costs to drill or operate the well, this is a major advantage over a \\"Working Interest\\". However, depending on the lease terms there may be post-production charges applied to the royalty interest for the royalty owner‚Äôs share of getting the hydrocarbons from the wellhead to a buyer. These post-production charges are applied as deductions (negative values) in the royalty statement details and you can often see the aggregated amount of deductions at the bottom of the royalty statement. #Overriding Royalty Interest (ORRI): A royalty in excess of the royalty provided to the mineral owners in an oil and gas lease. These do not affect the mineral owners. An example could be a geologist or a landman given a 1% ORRI by the operator in exchange for subsurface analysis or title work. #Working Interest (WI): A type of ownership where both costs and revenue are shared based on the percentage of ownership. Costs include drilling, prepping the well for production (completion), and ongoing operating expenses. Often the percentage of shared costs is higher than the percentage of shared revenue for WI owners. This is because of the need to pay royalty interests that don‚Äôt also bear the drilling and operating costs. #Non-Participating Royalty Interest (NPRI): This interest type is similar to a normal royalty interest in that these interest types do not bear costs to drill or operate a well. However, the interest owner does not have executive rights to make decisions such as leasing and they typically do not receive lease bonuses. NPRI‚Äôs are often created when a mineral owner wants maintain the ability to make decisions regarding their mineral rights and royalty interests while monetizing part of their royalties or leveraging a portion of the interest in negotiations. = Leasing = To bring oil and gas reserves to market, minerals are conveyed for a specified time to oil companies through a legally binding contract known as a lease. This arrangement between individual mineral owners and oil companies began prior to 1900 and still thrives today. Before exploration can begin, the mineral owner (lessor) and the oil company (lessee) must agree to certain terms regarding the rights, privileges and obligations of the respective parties during the exploration and possible production stages. Although there are numerous other important details, the basic structure of the lease is straightforward: in exchange for an up-front lease bonus payment, plus a royalty percentage of the value of any production, the mineral owner grants the oil company the right to drill for a period of time, known as the primary term. If the term of the oil or gas lease extends beyond the primary term, and a well was not drilled, then the Lessee is required to pay the lessor a delay rental. This delay rental could be $1 or more per acre. In some cases, no drilling occurs and the lease simply expires. The duration of the lease may be extended when drilling or production starts. This enters into the period of time known as the secondary term, which applies for as long as oil and gas is produced in paying quantities. = The division order = A division order is not a contract. It is a stipulation, derived from the lease agreement and other agreements, as to what the Operator of a well or an oil and/or gas purchaser will disburse in terms of revenue to the mineral owner and others. The purpose of the division order is to show how the mineral revenues are divided up between the oil company, the owners of the mineral rights (royalty owners) and the overriding royalty interest owners. The Division Order needs a signature, a current address and social security number for individual royalty owners or tax identification number for companies. =Oil and gas lease= An oil and gas lease is a contract because it contains consideration, consent, legal tangible items and competency. *The term of the lease. Usually there is a primary term and a secondary term. Each term has conditions set up either by the lessor or lessee to fulfill. *The royalty rate. This is how the rates are divided and how it is calculated from the revenues produced from the mineral rights. *If the lessor receives a bonus *If there is a delay rental agreement‚Äîany delay in production by the lessee for a negotiated period, the lessee can pay the lessor a negotiated amount of money per year to keep the contract active *If there is a \\"shut-in royalty\\" agreement‚Äîroyalties are paid at a negotiated rate per acre, only while the well is not producing oil or gas Many other line items can be negotiated by the time the contract is complete. The rights of all parties are defined in agreements; and, when mineral production begins, the division order states how much revenue goes to each party involved. = Royalty check = Mineral owners may receive a monthly royalty check if oil, gas, or any other substances of value are extracted from below the surface and either sold or used by an oil and gas operating company. Royalty statements include the production and revenue figures for both the individual owner and the entire well. The royalty paid is a function of the net value of the proceeds from the sale of the oil, gas, or other substance, multiplied by the owner's revenue interest decimal, less any amounts deducted for taxes or other deductions. The revenue decimal used to calculate the amount of an owner's royalty check is calculated with the following equation: * A = Net Mineral Acres owned * U = Number of Mineral Acres in the oil and gas drilling unit or pool * R = The Royalty assigned to the mineral right owner by the oil and gas lease covering his or her minerals * P = Participation Factor assigned to the tracts owned by the mineral owner as described in a unit agreement * Y = Additional Ownership Factor assigned to the owner's mineral rights by any other arrangement or agreement * D = Deductions Revenue interest decimal = (A / U) * R * (P * Y - D) It is common for royalty checks to fluctuate between pay periods due to monthly changes in oil or gas prices, or changes in the volumes produced by the associated oil or gas wells. Additionally, royalties may cease altogether if the associated wells quit producing marketable quantities of oil or gas, if the operating company has changed hands and the new operator has not yet established a new payment account for the owner, or if the operating company or product purchaser is missing appropriate paperwork or proper documentation of changes in ownership or contact information. Surface use agreement A surface use agreement (SUA) is a contract between a property owner and a mineral rights holder that dictates how the mineral rights are to be developed. Meaning, when mineral rights are extracted by a company that does not own the property above where the minerals are located, the company has the legal right to extract those minerals regardless. However, companies will often enter into voluntary negotiations with the surface rights owner to ensure that the operations all go smoothly. In such cases, the company will offer a SUA, in which property owners may ask for financial compensation or other concessions regarding how the minerals are extracted. See sample.

The hilly and winding section between Whaley Bridge and Macclesfield is often called 'The Highwayman' after a prominent roadside pub, now closed. Much of the route follows former turnpike roads through a scenic area of the Peak District National Park. Route The B5470 starts in Town End on the eastern side of Chapel-en-le-Frith at a junction with the A624, which connects it to the A6. It then runs westwards, forming the main street of Chapel-en-le-Frith. It then continues to the hamlet of Tunstead Milton after which it runs along the valley of the Randall Carr in a series of sweeping bends to Whaley Bridge. This length of the road is generally level and prone to flooding in wet weather. In Whaley Bridge the B5470 crosses the A5004 at the Horwich End traffic lights. It then climbs rapidly out of Whaley Bridge to the village of Kettleshulme, Cheshire. From Kettleshulme it descends into the valley of the Todd Brook before climbing via a sharp hairpin bend to its highest point of at Charles Head. The descent from Charles Head to the Harrop Brook is one of the few straight portions of the road. It then climbs again to the former Highwayman Inn on a section that is particularly prone to accidents due to misjudged overtaking. From the Highwayman the road descends through the village of Rainow, Cheshire, and then climbs the south edge of Kerridge Hill before beginning its final descent to Macclesfield, where it terminates at a junction with the A523. Use The B5470 is one of only two routes entering Macclesfield from the east. As well as being used as a main commuter route from the towns of northwest Derbyshire it also carries a high number of heavy goods vehicles and tourist traffic into the Peak District National Park, the last including cyclists and walkers. The road also forms part of the well-known 'Cat And Fiddle ‚Äì Long Hill ‚Äì Highwayman' triangle, which is particularly attractive to motorcyclists because of the frequency and severity of the bends. Given this mix of usage, the number and sharpness of the bends and the fact that it is not uncommon to encounter straying livestock on the road it is necessary to employ a great deal of caution. Severe winter weather can also make the road extremely hazardous. History The road follows former turnpike roads from Chapel-en- le-Frith to Whaley Bridge, built in 1727, and from Whaley Bridge to Macclesfield, built in 1770. There were toll bars at Hurdsfield, Rainow and Fernilee, and in 1825‚Äì26 the tolls raised a total of ¬£580 (modern equivalent ¬£). Several original milestones along the route are designated Listed Buildings. Responsibility for maintenance of turnpike roads was transferred to the county councils on their formation in 1888.

The investigation was conducted by the FBI and the Toledo Joint Terrorism Task Force, with the cooperation of an informant called 'The Trainer' who has a U.S. military background in security. The Cleveland FBI Special Agent in Charge C. Frank Figliuzzi and the U.S. attorney's general office credited the local Muslim and Arab-American community for passing along the information that lead to the arrest of the three terror suspects. During a February 2006 press briefing in Washington, DC, in the presence of the Deputy Director of the FBI John Pistole, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales accused the men of educating themselves on how to make and use explosives and suicide bomb vests by downloading videos off the internet, seeking firearm training, conspiring to provide terrorist funds abroad by using Mazloum's car dealership as a cover for traveling to and from Iraq, and making verbal threats against the President of the United States. This plot was mentioned as one of three examples of homegrown terrorism in a speech by the director of the FBI Robert Mueller on 23 June 2006 on the morning that the Miami bomb plot to attack the Sears Tower was announced. On 15 December 2007 Mohammad Zaki and two cousins Zubair Ahmed, Khaleel Ahmed, received indictments on further terrorism charges of conspiring to kill, kidnap or maim persons outside of the United States, including US military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, including taking weapons training, doing bodybuilding exercises and taking steroids, allegedly to prepare for attacks.

The volcano and the island is within the jurisdiction of the municipality of Calayan, in the province of Cagayan. Physical features The well-forested Mount Camiguin or Camiguin de Babuyanes, to distinguish it from Camiguin of Mindanao, has an elevation of asl, and a base diameter of . It occupies the SW tip of long Camiguin Island. Fumaroles are found on the southwest, west, and east flanks of the volcano and a boiling spring is located near sea level on the western flank of the volcano (magas-asok). The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOCS) lists Camiguin de Babuyanes as one of the active volcanoes in the Philippines. All volcanoes in the Philippines are part of the Pacific ring of fire. Eruptions An eruption was recorded around 1857. It was reported as phreatic and possibly partly submarine. In 1991, there were reports of volcanic activity but instrumental investigations showed no sign of unusual volcanic activity, such as intense fumarolic activity, felt earthquakes, fissuring at the volcano's slopes, or smell of sulphur. Another report of volcanic unrest was reported in 1993 but an aerial survey of the volcano proved no signs of activity.\\"Camiguin de Babuyanes \\".

Three local branches of the museum have been established since the 1970s: the Julian Fa≈Çat Museum, the Museum of Technology and Textile Industry, and the Weaver's House Museum. History of the Museum A historic stained- glass window with heraldic symbols inside the castle The Bielsko-Bia≈Ça Museum, with its main location in the historical Bielsko Castle has maintained museum traditions conceived at the beginning of the 20th century, when the local government of Silesian Bielsko and Galician Bia≈Ça founded two separate museums. The older Bia≈Ça Municipal Museum was set up upon the initiative of Bielsko Gymnasium (lower secondary school) teacher Erwin Hanslik by virtue of the City Council Resolution of 19 December 1902. At the same time, in a forum of the City Council of neighbouring Bielsko, similar initiative was taken by Arthur Schmidt, a protestant vicar of that town. In the months that followed, by his application, in 1903 there was undertaken in Bielsko and its surroundings a splendid action of collecting artefacts of museum-value. Its outcome was shown in June 1903 at Bielsko Shooting Gallery at a display of local antiquities. A few months later Bielsko City Council called into being Municipal Museum in Bielsko. Some time passed, however, before both museum opened to the public. The Bia≈Ça Museum was opened on 3 December 1904 in the City Hall, where it functioned until 1920. Then the activities of the Museum were suspended, its exhibits stored in one room and the facility changed its purpose. It was not until 1932 that the Museum was reopened, this time in the basement of the building, where it functioned until the outbreak of World War II when the Museum closed down. The Bielsko Museum was opened to the general public on 25 February 1906 in the building of Old Town Hall at 9 Rynek, where it operated without a closure until 1941. During the inter-war period, thanks to the endeavours of its curator, Edward Schnack, the exposition significantly grew in number. At that time it was one of the largest regional museums in Poland and the third in Silesia, preceded by those functioning in Katowice and Cieszyn. In 1941, the Nazi authorities joined the two municipal museums in the so-called Heimatmuseum, which was housed in Bia≈Ça in the former guild house. There it survived until the end of World War II. In 1945 a decision was passed to revive the museum. The Municipal Museum in Bielsko opened to the public on 14 February 1947. Since the seventies of the 20th century, several local branches have been established: the Julian Fa≈Çat Museum (1973), The \\"Museum of Textile Technology\\" ‚Äì at present the Museum of Technology and Textile Industry (1979) and the Weaver's House Museum (1992). Since 2001 the museum has been called the Bielsko-Bia≈Ça Museum and since 2013 the Bielsko-Bia≈Ça Historical Museum. The Castle Towering in the Bielsko-Bia≈Ça city centre, the Castle is the oldest and largest construction of historical importance, erected in the old town of Bielsko. A legend says that in its place there used to be a settlement of robbers who attacked travelling merchants. The Opole Prince, Casimir (1229/30) of the Piasts is said to have conquered that fortalice, wiped out the robbers and had the hunting palace erected in that place, which over the years grew into a magnificent castle around which the city of Bielsko developed. The oldest part of the Castle dates back to 14th century. Over the next centuries the Castle gradually developed and transformed. It is a city castle in its nature, incorporated into the system of Bielsko fortifications from the beginning, at the same time providing their strongest section. Over the centuries it performed the function of a Silesian border-stronghold, first guarding the borders of Cieszyn and O≈õwiƒôcim district duchies and then in the second half of the 15th century it protected the Czech and Polish state border and from 1526 - the Austrian-Polish border. Starting from the close of the 16th century, its defensive role was declining and the Castle gradually transformed into a nobleman‚Äôs mansion. The present appearance of the castle dates back to the last, thorough reconstruction undertaken in the second half of the 19th century, which entirely wiped out its previous characteristics of style. During the years 1899-1973, in place of brick breast wall presently seen on the east part of the Castle, there used to be a parade of bazaars, constituting an attractive architectural foundation for the body of the Castle. The bazaars were pulled down in connection with widening of Zamkowa Street. The Castle erected by Piasts ruling over the Cieszyn Dutchy was one of their residences for over two centuries. From 1572 it was the administrative and commercial centre of the independent class-based Bielsko state, governed by representatives of nobleman‚Äôs families of the Promnitzes, Schaffgotsches, Sunneghs, Solmses and Haugwitzes. In 1752, the position of that state was raised to the position of duchies which went into the rule of the Su≈Çkowskis family. The Bielsko Dutchy existed until 1849, when Austria introduced modern administrative division, thus doing away with old feudal structures and was incorporated into Bielsko District Starosty. The Castle itself and numerous estates in the vicinity of the city remained in the possession of the Su≈Çkowskis until 1945. After World War II the Castle was taken over by the Polish State as the property left by the Germans and was facilitated as the seat of many cultural institutions. Since 1983 the Castle sole usufructary has been the national Museum in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, subordinated to Silesian local government in Katowice. =Permanent exhibition= \\"Blue salon\\" with art gallery. The permanent exhibition in the Castle encompasses a number of rooms on the first floor. The accession to it runs along the 19th century vestibule, restored in 2001. In the west wing of the building the hunting room and armoury are located. The next two rooms display three centuries of art history from the 15th to the 17th century. Neighbouring with these rooms are a rococo concert hall and a Biedermeier room. The Castle's east wing contains a gallery of the 19th and 20th century painting and graphic art. Following rooms located in the north wing display an exhibition devoted to the history of the city and Castle, as well as craftsman traditions of old Bielsko and Bia≈Ça. The east wing of the castle is occupied by art gallery. The 19th paintings displayed here include works of art representing realism and academism, M≈Çoda Polska (Young Poland) paintings, works of artists connected with Bielsko-Bia≈Ça during the twenty years of independence after World War I and during the modern times. Along the courtyard-facing vestibule there has been displayed a collection of graphic art produced by artists of the early 20th century as well as portraits showing inhabitants of Bielsko and Bia≈Ça in the 19th and 20th century. Furthermore, on the ground floor of the Castle there are three other rooms housing museum's temporary exhibitions. Museum of Technology and Textile Industry Machines at the preliminary section in the Museum of Technology The Museum preserves traditions of the wool industry in Bielsko- Bia≈Ça, by means of collecting machines, equipment and documents related to this field of manufacturing. The exhibits are stored in four rooms. Each of them is commensurate with division of old textile factory ‚Äì preliminary treatment mill, weaving mill and finishing mill. A separate unit consists of machines for making hats. The display is complemented by exhibition devoted to the history of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça fire brigade and of municipal water supply system. There is also a little printing office and a so-called museum granary, where all the historical household equipments, radio sets, typewriters etc., are being stored. The historical lathe, drilling machines and locksmith tools remind of the traditions of metal processing industry in Bielsko. The Weaver‚Äôs House Fragment of the workshop in the Weaver's House Reconstruction of the interior of a weaver‚Äôs house and workshop owned by a guild master underlies the exhibition housed in the Weaver‚Äôs House. Its arrangement is an attempt to bring closer the living and working conditions in a house of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. A hall splits the house into two major sections ‚Äì workshop on the left of the entrance and living quarters on the right, with a kitchen and a bedroom. The Weaver‚Äôs House reveals an original example of the former wooden town housing. It is a unique attempt to show craftsman‚Äôs work, fully shaped by strong guild‚Äôs position. Julian Fa≈Çat‚Äôs Villa Julian Fa≈Çat‚Äôs Villa The museum of Julian Fa≈Çat in Bystra ≈ölƒÖska is housed in a historical villa of the artist, called ‚ÄúFa≈Çat√≥wka‚Äù and its visitors are introduced to the art and some biographical details of the artist. This is the house where the artists lived upon retirement from the position of a rector of the Cracow Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition presents oil paintings and watercolours: self-portraits, portraits of his family and friends, landscapes from his numerous travels and hunting-related works. The exhibition is enriched with archival material devoted to the life artistic output and social activities for the benefits of society. Exhibits include School Certificates, photographs of Fa≈Çat with his family and friends, diplomas, honorary mentions, distinctions, letters and souvenirs related to his travels around the world.

History Officially formed on 14 March 1950 and registered as the \\"Canberra Orchestral Society\\" (COS), rehearsals were originally held in the ante-room of Albert Hall under the baton of conductor Pieter Kruithof, a Dutch migrant with organ and choral background who was being employed as a cleaner. Concerts were also held in school halls and the Childers Street Hall of the Australian National University. Wilfred Holland from England, with his strong conducting and performance background, led the orchestra for much of the 60‚Äôs. He also guided the Canberra Choral Society and the two organisations held joint performances of many early choral masterpieces. In 1965 Ernest Llewellyn, former concertmaster of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra arrived in Canberra to take up the position of Director of the newly formed Canberra School of Music. He also was invited to the role of conductor of the Canberra Symphony. Llewellyn‚Äôs tremendous reputation made it possible for him to recruit top professional players to teach at the School and to join the orchestra. In no time the CSO was flourishing with sold-out performances at the newly opened Canberra Theatre. Ernest Llewellyn continued to strengthen and extend the orchestra until his retirement in 1980, at which time the new School of Music auditorium was officially named Llewellyn Hall in his honour. The CSO was lucky to secure Leonard Dommett as the new Conductor and Musical Director in 1982. As the former Concertmaster of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Dommett brought an impressive network of national and international artists to the CSO stage. Throughout the 80‚Äôs the orchestra continued to expand and artistic achievement was continually evolving. Dommett retired in 1991 and the ensuing decade brought further change to the orchestra, including the implementation of fully professional status in 1994. Large opera gala concerts featured celebrity conductors such as Richard Bonynge and Isaiah Jackson. When Richard Gill joined the CSO as Chief Conductor and Artistic Director in 2001, the organisation was going through difficult times. He brought much needed consistency and stability to the orchestra ‚Äì and within a couple of years after his arrival, the CSO was back on a solid financial footing. Dr Nicholas Milton took up the baton as Chief Conductor and Artistic Director in 2007 and his passion, vision and expertise has inspired players and audiences alike. Milton is a rising Australian conductor now based in Germany who was also a former violinist with the Macquarie Trio. Also in 2007 the CSO received Commonwealth Government funding for the first time which has allowed for additional rehearsals and larger orchestras on stage. For the Canberra Centenary season of 2013, the ACT Government enlisted the CSO to perform the World Premiere of a commissioned work by Andrew Schultz, Symphony No. 3 ‚Äì Century, as a feature of the official Canberra Day celebrations in March 2013.

The method of lines (MOL, NMOL, NUMOL) is a technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in which all but one dimension is discretized. MOL allows standard, general-purpose methods and software, developed for the numerical integration of ODEs and DAEs, to be used. Many integration routines have been developed over the years in many different programming languages, and some have been published as open source resources. The method of lines most often refers to the construction or analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations that proceeds by first discretizing the spatial derivatives only and leaving the time variable continuous. This leads to a system of ordinary differential equations to which a numerical method for initial value ordinary equations can be applied. The method of lines in this context dates back to at least the early 1960s. Many papers discussing the accuracy and stability of the method of lines for various types of partial differential equations have appeared since.  Application to elliptical equations  MOL requires that the PDE problem is well-posed as an initial value (Cauchy) problem in at least one dimension, because ODE and DAE integrators are initial value problem (IVP) solvers. Thus it cannot be used directly on purely elliptic partial differential equations, such as Laplace's equation. However, MOL has been used to solve Laplace's equation by using the method of false transients. In this method, a time derivative of the dependent variable is added to Laplace‚Äôs equation. Finite differences are then used to approximate the spatial derivatives, and the resulting system of equations is solved by MOL. It is also possible to solve elliptical problems by a semi- analytical method of lines. In this method, the discretization process results in a set of ODE's that are solved by exploiting properties of the associated exponential matrix. Recently, to overcome the stability issues associated with the method of false transients, a perturbation approach was proposed which was found to be more robust than standard method of false transients for a wide range of elliptic PDEs.

It means to read a text as it was not meant to be read; in fact reading the text against itself. Textual example By way of illustration, consider Andrew Marvell's poem To His Coy Mistress. A resistant reading may develop from an alternative reading, pointing out how the representation of gender in the poem furthers the notion of gender as binary oppositions, the male is active and powerful, the female is passive and marginalized. As such, it will be read by readers who share feminist views of the world as gender inequality and discrimination against women. For example, Marvell's representation of heterosexuality in the poem may be read as being exploitative, based as it is on the persona psychologically terrorizing the woman. Marvell depicts his persona as attempting to have the woman submit as a result of the fear he seeks to instill within her; Marvell's vivid and confronting imagery is most significant and not accidental: > Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound / My echoing song: then worms shall > try / That long preserved virginity... Importance Resistant reading is an important element of our critical and interpretive repertoire. It is worth considering whether diegetic border crossing always strengthens the potential for resistant reading (as might seem intuitively likely, given that readers are moving in and out of the story), or whether on some occasions it might trigger the reverse effect.Journal of Literacy Research, Spring 2003 by Mackey, Margaret See also * Judith Fetterley * The Resisting Reader (1977), by Judith Fetterley * Robert Belton, Sights of Resistance: Approaches to Canadian Visual Culture (Calgary: University of Calgary Press, 2001). *Postcritique References Literary criticism ","title":"Resistant reading"},{"id":"5744157","text":"Yakov Timofeyevich Cherevichenko (; 12 October 1894 - 4 July 1976) was a Soviet military leader. Biography =First World War and Civil War= Yakov Cherevichenko was born to peasant parents in the village of Novosyolovka in the Russian Empire (now in Rostov Oblast, Russian Federation). He was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army at the beginning of the First World War in 1914 and was a senior NCO by the time of the October Revolution in 1917. Cherevichenko returned to his native region to organize a partisan group to defend the newly formed Bolshevik government against the anti-Bolshevik White movement after the Revolution, and this group became part of the Red Army in October 1918. Cherevichenko joined the Bolshevik Party at the height of the Russian Civil War in 1919 and served in the 1st Cavalry Army. =Between the wars= Cherevichenko attended the Red Army's Higher Cavalry School in 1924 and graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1935. He was awarded the rank of lieutenant-general when the traditional general officer ranks were introduced in the Red Army and served as commander of the Odessa Military District from 1940 to 1941. He was promoted to colonel-general in February 1941. =World War II= Cherevichenko was the commanding officer of the 9th Army from June to September 1941 and the 2nd Army from 29 September to 4 October 1941. He assumed command of the Southern Front (Army Group) from Lieutenant-General Dmitry Ryabyshev on 5 October 1941. With the majority of Ukraine already in German hands by October 1941, Kleist's Panzers advanced across the Mius River to Russia's Rostov Oblast and had occupied the city of Taganrog by November 4, preparing to move further for an attack on Rostov.Glantz, David M. (1989). Soviet Military Deception in the Second World War. Totowa: Frank Cass. pp. 42-47. . Cherevichenko and the Army's commander for the Southwestern Direction, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, prepared to attempt a counterattack. Timoshenko later shifted two rifle divisions and a tank brigade from the Southwestern Front to prepare a Southern Front reserve and settled on a plan worked out with his chief of staff, Major-General Alexey Antonov, and Stavka also provided the 37th Army to reinforce the operation on Timoshenko's request. Though preferring to delay the counterattack because of the delays needed in assembling some of his units, Cherevichenko was pressed to commence the operation by Stavka and had the attack begin on November 17 with just four rifle divisions and one tank brigade, but only one day late. Though able to capture Rostov, Kleist's Panzer Army was caught by surprise in the counterattack and was compelled to abandon the city by the end of the month. On November 30, Pravda published a photograph of Cherevichenko alongside Marshal Stalin's praise of the Rostov defenders.Mawdsley, Evan (2011). December 1941: Twelve Days That Began a World War. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 41. . On December 2, the German rode their tanks back to the Mius River. Credited for his successful work at Rostov, Cherevichenko was made commander of the Bryansk Frontformed for the second time from the 3rd Army from the Central Front, the 13th Army from the Southwestern Front, and the 61st Army from the reserveon 24 December 1941. This Front would take part in the last phase of the Battle of Moscow in conjunction with the adjacent Western Front of Army General Georgy Zhukov and the Kalinin Front of Colonel- General Ivan Konev.Rzheshevsky, Oleg A.

New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 41. . Relieved as commander of the Bryansk Front by Lieutenant-General Filipp Golikov in April 1942, Cherevichenko was made deputy commander of the North Caucasus Front, subordinated to Front Commander Marshal Semyon Budyonny, who had been Cherevichenko's commanding officer in the 1st Cavalry Army in the Civil War. In August 1942, Budyonny named Cherevichenko commander of the Black Sea Group of Forces, whose responsibility included the defense of the port city of Novorossiysk and its Black Sea Fleet naval base, which fell to the Germans in the course of Operation Blue in the fall of 1942. No longer as esteemed as previously by superior officers in the high command, Cherevichenko was made commander of the 5th Army of the Soviet Western Front in October 1942, replacing Lieutenant-General Ivan Fedyuninsky upon his promotion to deputy commander of the Volkhov Front. Relieved of this command in favor of Lieutenant-General Vitaly Polenov, Cherevichenko was left at the disposal of Stavka without commander's responsibility until April 1943, when he was made an assistant of the commander of the Northern Caucasus Front (Colonel-General Ivan Maslennikov until May, then Colonel-General Ivan Petrov). Cherevichenko held the position of commanding officer of the Kharkov Military District upon its recreation in September 1944 until January 1944, then served at the disposal of Stavka and the military councils of the 2nd and 1st Belorussian Fronts.

Naomi Watts, Tim Roth, Michael Pitt, and Brady Corbet star in the main roles. The film is a shot-for-shot remake of the 1997 film, albeit in English and set in the United States with different actors. Like the original, the film follows a middle class family as they encountered two young men on their vacation. The family was subsequently captured and tortured by them, giving them until the next day to survive. Exterior scenes were filmed on Long Island. The film is an international co-production of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. Haneke has stated that the film is a reflection and criticism of violence used in media. Plot George and Ann Farber, their son Georgie, and their dog Lucky arrive at their lake house. Their next-door neighbour, Fred, is seen with two young men, Peter and Paul. They find Fred reacting somewhat awkwardly. Fred and Paul come over to help put the boat into the lake. After they leave, George and Georgie stay outside by the lake, tending to their boat. Georgie asks his father why Fred was behaving so strangely. While Ann is in the kitchen cooking, Peter visits and asks to borrow some eggs. Ann gives him the eggs but Peter clumsily drops them. Feeling a little annoyed after Peter accidentally knocks her phone into the sink filled with water, Ann gives him another four eggs and he leaves. Soon afterwards she hears Lucky barking and finds Peter and Paul inside together. Lucky had jumped on Peter, causing him to break the second batch of eggs. Paul asks her to try out one of the golf clubs outside, and she begrudgingly agrees. In the boat, George and Georgie hear Lucky barking hysterically when suddenly the barking stops. Peter and Paul request more eggs, and Ann becomes frustrated, but George arrives and tries to force the men to leave, slapping Paul. In retaliation, Peter breaks one of George's legs with the golf club. The two young men then take the family hostage. Paul guides Ann on a hunt to find the family's dog, which he had killed with George's golf club. When their neighbors, the Thompsons, visit, Ann passes the two men off as friends. After returning to the house, the Farbers are forced to participate in a number of sadistic games in order to stay alive. Paul asks if George or Ann wants to bet that they will be alive by 9:00 in the morning, and says that he and Peter are betting they will not be. Paul frequently ridicules Peter's weight and lack of intelligence, and describes a number of contradicting stories of Peter's past, although no definitive explanation is ever presented as to the men's origins or motives. During the \\"games\\", Peter and Paul put Georgie's head in a bag and ask Ann to strip naked. Georgie is nearly suffocated until George asks Ann to follow the men's instructions. When released from the bag, Georgie escapes the house with the help of his parents. He goes to the neighbors', where he discovers their bloody corpses. Meanwhile, Paul pushes Ann, whose hands have been tied with tape behind her back, onto a sofa that is some space away from George, and ties her ankles with tape before going out to search for Georgie, leaving Peter to watch over the Farbers. Ann asks why they do not directly kill them, and Peter answers that they should not forget the fun of the games. When Peter goes to kitchen to get eggs, Ann jumps to George but George fails to untie her before Peter comes back, and Peter beats her and breaks the eggs again. Ann begs Peter to let them go, but he refuses. Georgie finds a shotgun in the neighbors' house and Paul tells him to go ahead and shoot him with it, but the gun fails to go off. Paul returns him to the living room, and gives the shotgun to Peter. The men play a new game, saying whoever gets counted out will be shot. While Paul is in the kitchen getting something to eat, Georgie panics and runs, which results in Peter shooting and killing him. Paul berates Peter for being trigger-happy, and the two men decide to briefly leave. George and Ann are grief-stricken over their loss, but they eventually resolve to survive. Ann is able to free herself and flee the house while George desperately tries to make a call on the malfunctioning phone. Ann fails to find help, only to be re-captured by Peter and Paul, who bring her back to the house. After stabbing George, they tell Ann to say a prayer before making a choice for her husband; a painful and prolonged death with the \\"little\\" knife, or a quick and brutal death with the \\"big\\" shotgun. While Paul is talking, Ann seizes the shotgun on the table in front of her and kills Peter. An enraged Paul grabs the shotgun and starts looking for the television remote. Upon finding it, he rewinds the last occurrences back to a moment before Ann grabs the shotgun, breaking the fourth wall. On the \\"do over\\", Paul snatches the shotgun away before she can grab it and admonishes her, saying she is not allowed to break the rules. Peter and Paul kill George and take Ann, bound and gagged, out onto the family's boat. Ann tries to free herself, but is caught by Paul and Peter. Around eight o'clock in the morning, they nonchalantly throw her into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. They knock on the door of the Thompsons' house and request some eggs. The film ends with Paul glancing at the camera with a smirk.

Development Michael Haneke wanted to make a film set in the United States, but for practical reasons he had to set the original 1997 film in Austria.Koehler, Robert. \\"Funny Games.\\" (Archive) Cineaste. Retrieved on 12 October 2013. After the 2007 film used the same house including props and tones, Robert Koehler of Cineaste wrote that this \\"proves for certain that‚Äîwhether he uses the great cinematographer Jurgen Jurges (for the 1997 version) or the great Darius Khondji (for the new film)‚ÄîHaneke is fundamentally his own cinematographer exercising considerable control over the entire look of his films.\\" Release The film made its British premiere at the London Film Festival on 20 October 2007. Its United States premiere was at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival on 19 January 2008. It began a limited release in the United States and Canada on 14 March 2008, distributed by Warner Independent. A wider release to more theaters came on 8 April 2008. The film was shown at the Istanbul Film Festival in April 2008. It did not receive a wide theatrical release in the United States before coming out on DVD. Funny Games was a box office failure, grossing a little more than half of its $15 million budget. Guardian writer Geoffrey Macnab included Funny Gamess lack of success among the reasons for the closure of Tartan Films, which co-produced the film and released it in the United Kingdom. In Germany, the film was released under the title \\"Funny Games U.S.\\".Funny Games U.S. - moviepilot.de. Retrieved 16 November 2009. The film's poster, done by Akiko Stehrenberger, is considered by professional poster designer Adrian Curry to be his favorite film poster of the 2000s. =Home media= The DVD was released on 10 June 2008, in the US. The DVD does not contain any extra material but instead it includes both widescreen and full screen editions on one disc. In the UK, the DVD and Blu-ray were released on 28 July with the extra material being the original theatrical trailer, Q&A; with producers Hamish McAlpine and Chris Coen, interviews with the cast, viral video clips and film notes. Themes Haneke states that the entire film was not intended to be a horror film. He says he wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless movie. He had written a short essay revealing how he felt on the issue, called \\"Violence + Media.\\" The essay is included as a chapter in the book A Companion to Michael Haneke.Haneke, Michael (2010). \\"Violence and the Media\\". In Roy Grundmann (Ed.), A Companion to Michael Hankek, pp. 575‚Äì579. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 51% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 142 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though made with great skill, Funny Games is nevertheless a sadistic exercise in chastising the audience.\\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 44 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Todd Gilchrist from IGN called the film \\"Unrelenting and brilliant, Funny Games is a truly great film ‚Äì an incisive, artistic triumph that doubles as a remarkably thrilling and unique cinematic experience.\\" Conversely, Joshua Rothkopf from Time Out New York called the film \\"a sour project that defines anti-imaginative.\\" A.O. Scott of the New York Times wrote: \\"At least with the remake Funny Games, Mr. Haneke shows a certain kinship with someone like Eli Roth, whose Hostel movies have brought nothing but scorn from responsible critics.\\" The Chicago Sun-Times review of 14 March 2008 gave the film a mere half-star out of a possible four. The Times of London ranked it #25 on its 100 Worst Films of 2008 list, calling it \\"art- house torture porn.\\" () Soundtrack The music in the introduction and the closing credits is \\"Bonehead\\" by Naked City from the album Torture Garden.

Mark Oliver Everett wrote the song after finishing writing the album, and the record company insisted he put it on the album as well. He was against this idea, considering it a disruption of the album's flow, but made the compromise by putting it in as a bonus track.  Release  The single reached No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart.  Legacy  The song features prominently in the 2000 film Road Trip, and is used in part in the 2008 film Charlie Bartlett. In his autobiography, Everett states that letting the song be used for Road Trip is one of the few real regrets he has ever had. He only agreed to it because the record company threatened to not release the album if he did not go along with the recording of the video clip, and at this point the album had been on hold for over 7 months.

They incorporate various styles such as punk, pop, alternative rock, and folk in their music. They are best known for their 2007 single \\"Same Jeans\\" which reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. The band is currently signed to Cooking Vinyl and have released five studio albums since their platinum selling debut Hats Off to the Buskers, which topped the UK Albums Chart in January 2007 and was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Music Prize. Despite never matching this early success, they enjoy a large fanbase in their native Scotland with albums regularly topping the Scottish Albums Chart. The band also hold a reputation for their live performances with regularly sold out tours in Scotland. The View are also regular fixtures at music festivals throughout the UK; they have played at Scotland's largest festival‚ÄîT in the Park‚Äîa record eight times, with organiser Geoff Ellis saying, \\"The View can play every year under my watch, if they want to.\\" History =Formation and early touring (2005-2006)= The View initially formed around a cover band at school, playing their own versions of bands such as Squeeze and the Sex Pistols. Lead singer Kyle Falconer, guitarist Peter Reilly, bassist Kieren Webster and original drummer Michael Annable all attended St John's RC High School, They began by performing a number of their own songs and cover versions at school talent contests. The deputy head teacher of St John's stated that he knew the band would go far and he told them to push for a record deal. The View entered the school talent contest four times but were only successful twice. Following this, the band set up base to write their own material in a back room of The Bayview Pub, a bar owned by Falconer's cousin. They progressed to play more cover gigs and weddings around the Dundee area, including the Centenary Bar in Central Dundee and a caravan park in Arbroath. The band were later ejected from their base in The Bayview, following singer Kyle Falconer reportedly riding a scooter along the bar. The band continued to tour small venues around their hometown, and after their second billed gig at The Doghouse, they were signed to local independent Dundee record label Two Thumbs, and released the self-titled The View EP in early 2006. Alongside the EP, the band recorded a complete demo album at T-Pot studios in Perthshire and this was made available for download from the band's Two Thumbs management website. Videos were also made available to accompany some of the recordings. During this period the band came to the attention of BBC Radio 1 presenters Zane Lowe, Edith Bowman and Jo Whiley as well as BBC Radio 2 presenter Dermot O'Leary who gave them airplay nine months before the album hit number one. The band's live performance of \\"Wasted Little DJs\\" (later to be their first single) featured on Zane's show of 8 February 2006, alongside established acts The Kooks and Be Your Own Pet. Soon after, tracks from the debut EP began to be played on Radio 1 and other local and national stations. In particular, Jim Gellatly, at Xfm Scotland, featured the band heavily on X-Posure Scotland, his new music show. A live acoustic session was recorded for the show broadcast 3 May 2006. On 26 and 27 August 2006, the View were a last-minute addition to the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The NME reported the fans' chant of \\"The View, the View are on fire\\" could be heard ringing loudly around the packed tent. They also played both festivals in 2007. In mid-2006 the band began a UK wide headline tour. During this tour the band played their first headline show in Scotland at the Liquid Room on 1 September 2006, they then went on to play dates with other major acts and feature in the MTV2 Gonzo tour. Documenting this, a half-hour-long special On Tour With The View was broadcast on MTV2 on 18 November 2006. In December 2006, the band played gigs in Tokyo, Japan and made their first trip to the United States, in January 2007, playing dates in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. =Hats Off to the Buskers (2006-2008)= In mid-2006, they began to record their debut album, with Owen Morris, who had previously produced albums by Oasis and The Verve. During the production of the album, co-writer and bassist Kieren Webster was voted as number six on the NME Cool List 2006 Top 50. Titled Hats Off to the Buskers, the album was released on 22 January 2007 and entered the UK album chart at No. 1 on 28 January. Following the album's release, the band took part in the NME Awards Tour 2007, alongside acts such as The Automatic, The Horrors and Mumm-Ra and \\"Wasted Little DJs\\" was voted Best Track of the year at the annual NME Awards 2007. The View announced their \\"Rocket to Russia\\" tour which visited many countries around Europe such as Holland, Russia and Germany. During the tour, the View played with the Underground Heroes at the Tap'n'Tin in Chatham. At the end of the night, the View and Underground Heroes joined forces on a version of \\"Same Jeans\\". The union prompted the band to be called 'The Underground View'. In 2007, the band performed shows in Australia and performed \\"Same Jeans\\" on the talk show Rove Live. Instead of waiting on-stage to shake hands with the host, the band immediately left the stage, leaving Rove McManus with a simple pat on the back from Steven Morrison. Taken from the album, their first single, \\"Wasted Little DJs\\", was released 7 August 2006. The single is dedicated to a pair of blonde hairdressers from Dundee who go by the name \\"wasted little DJs\\". The girls set the trend for hairstyles in Dundee, and many of the band's female fans sport the same unique hairstyle. The first single entered the UK top 75 at No. 73 on the week before full release, due to download sales alone, and climbed to No. 15 the following week. Four weeks prior to release, on 9 July 2006, the single entered the UK MTV/NME video charts at Number 9, climbing to Number 1 on 13 August 2006. The single was the BBC Radio 1 Colin and Edith show's record of the week for week commencing Monday, 10 July 2006 and entered the BBC Radio 1 daytime playlist on 12 July 2006. The band followed up with their second single \\"Superstar Tradesman\\", released 23 October 2006, also reaching No. 15 in the UK. \\"Same Jeans\\", the third single from the album, was released 15 January 2007. It became their most successful single to date, reaching No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart and becoming a major hit for the band. Subsequent singles however, a double a-side of \\"The Don\\"/\\"Skag Trendy\\" and \\"Face for the Radio\\", failed to receive such chart success, reaching only No. 33 and No. 69 respectively in the UK Singles Chart. \\"The Don\\"/\\"Skag Trendy\\" is to date the View's last single to chart in the UK top 40. In early 2006, the band signed to James Endeacott's new record label 1965 Records, part of the Sony BMG group and linked to Columbia Records. A rare live version of \\"Screamin' n Shoutin'\\", recorded at the University of Abertay Dundee, headlined the NME/1965 Records cover CD featured with the NME issue dated 25 November 2006. The band announced a national tour in April 2007 to mark the album release. Tickets for the entire UK tour sold out within 1 hour. In August, they headlined the NME/Radio 1 stage at the Carling: Reading and Leeds festival. The band announced a six-date national tour for December 2007 to support their new album due out in 2008. =Which Bitch? (2009-2011)= The View appeared at Reading and Leeds Festival in August and at the Isle of Wight Festival on 12 June 2009. They also performed on King Tut's Wah Wah Hut Tent stage at T in The Park on 10 July 2009. They supported Mando Diao through Europe in summer and fall. Prior to this they played a sell out tour of Britain including Newcastle University. They played in the Falls Festival Australia December 2009. The band released their second album Which Bitch? on Monday 2 February 2009. In its initial week of release it debuted at No. 4 in the UK albums chart, but fell to No. 27 the following week and was out of the top 40 another week later. The first single from the album, \\"5 Rebbecca's\\" did poorly in the UK charts peaking at just No. 57\\\\. It was followed by \\"Shock Horror\\", which despite having significantly greater airplay charted even lower at No. 64\\\\. The album's third and last single \\"Temptation Dice\\" missed the top 100 altogether. Michael Annable leaves band. Limited Edition copies of the album featured a DVD containing their full-length documentary, Dryburgh Style, a gig from the Glasgow Barrowlands and all music videos released up to \\"Shock Horror\\". The View toured in early March 2010, visiting Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh. The tour showcased new material from their upcoming album. In addition to this, Kyle Falconer played an acoustic, charity solo show in Liverpool on 27 February. On 23 February 2010, it was announced that the band will play at T in the Park 2010 on the Main stage. The band have also been confirmed for Maynooth university festival, The Gathering. The View played an intimate venue tour during November and December 2010 playing material from the new album. The tour began in Scotland in Aberdeen, then proceeded in England, before finishing back in Scotland at Velocity in Dunfermline. =Bread and Circuses (2011-2012)= The third album was rumoured to be completed in April 2010. The View have since cancelled a live performance at Delamere Forest due to 'recording commitments'. In an interview with Scottish newspaper The Daily Record, bassist Kieren Webster said the album is being produced by Youth, who has worked with the likes of The Verve and Primal Scream.Dingwall, John. \\"The View recruit legendary producer Youth to help create third album \\", Daily Record. 21 June 2010 They produced \\"Sunday\\", a track from the forthcoming album, available as a free download from their website, on 1 November.The View's website, post from 1 Nov 2010 On 17 December 2010, the View informed on their website that the album's name would be The Best Lasts Forever and it would be released on 14 March 2011; however, on 13 January 2011, they announced the album would instead be called Bread and Circuses. They also announced that they would release the first single from the album on 6 March, and that it would be entitled 'Grace'.The View's website, post from 17 Dec 2010 The song charted outside the UK top 100. Afterwards, the already downloadable \\"Sunday\\" was rereleased in June 2011 as part of the Cutting Corners EP which also included album track \\"Happy\\" along with two new tracks, \\"Sideways\\" and \\"Alone\\", which both have had positive reviews from fans. The EP also includes the Tim Hutton remix of \\"Sunday\\". =Cheeky for a Reason (2012-2013)= In an interview with NME after T in the Park 2011, frontman Kyle Falconer said that they had begun to write songs for the fourth album, and that it could be out by Christmas. However, he later admitted that these comments were rather over- enthusiastic, and the album would be ready around the summer of 2012. In autumn 2011, their website announced they were going to record demos in T Pot studios, the same studio they recorded the demos for Hats Off To The Buskers. Speaking about the album's sound, Kyle Falconer said it was \\"Fleetwood Mac's Rumours done by The Clash.\\" A free download of the album track, \\"Hold On Now\\" was available for a limited period in May 2012 to give fans a taster of the new album. This went down well and the band have since announced that their first single from the album will be \\"How Long\\", which was released on 9 July 2012. The first gigs that the View played in 2011 were at King Tut's in Glasgow, on 25 and 26 January. They were both sold out. A tour to promote the new album was announced on 31 January, and will begin on 4 April. It will involve three Scottish gigs: the Caird Hall in Dundee, Aberdeen Music Hall and Barrowlands in Glasgow. On 21 March 2011, it was announced they would attend the Reading and Leeds festival. On 8 July, they played on the main stage at T in the Park. After the release of \\"Cheeky for a Reason\\", the View announced it would begin touring in November and December. They kicked off the tour at Stoke Sugarmill on 28 November. The tours stops included, Bournemouth, London, Sunderland, Derby, Norwich, Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow and ended with a homecoming show at Dundee on 19 December. They headlined the Saturday of RockNess festival however this was abandoned after three songs due to over- crowding and rescheduled to the Sunday. They also played Main stage at T in the Park 2012 under the guise of The Dryburgh Soul Band. =Seven Year Setlist (2013-2015)= On 10 April 2013, the View announced they would be releasing a compilation album called Seven Year Setlist. The album has been named this due to the fact that the track listing features songs that are most commonly played in the set-lists at the band's concerts (excluding the new tracks). The compilation features several of the band's singles mixed with a couple of album tracks which feature heavily in the band's usual setlist. The album has been rumored to release around September, the time Kyle reminds us when he \\"Was attacked by the geese at camper down zoo\\" In a new interview with Clash Music. It is to includes 3 brand new unheard tracks: \\"Kill Kyle\\", \\"Dirty Magazine\\", and \\"Standard\\". The View are due to play several gigs in support of the release of the compilation, including a string of performances at the Propaganda Indie Club nights across the UK, an intimate gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut, they also supported The Stone Roses at their Glasgow Green concert on 15 June 2013. The band announced unplugged show scheduled for June in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and three dates at Oran Mor in Glasgow. All shows sold-out within hours of going on general sale. A special one-off show was scheduled for Shetland, their second on the island, with the previous gig being in December 2012. =Ropewalk (2015-present)= The View's fifth studio album was produced by Albert Hammond Jr. and is entitled Ropewalk after the Hamburg Reeperbahn district where it was recorded. The album was due to be released on 8 June 2015 with a UK tour held throughout March and April 2015. However, on 13 May 2015 it was announced that the album release will be postponed until 11 September 2015, due to Kyle receiving treatment for an unspecified but ongoing illness. Release was then brought forward to 4 September 2015. To coincide with the release the View played in-store performances at music stores throughout Scottish cities as well as a one-off exclusive gig in their hometown of Dundee. The band played a number of festivals throughout 2015 including the main stage at T in the Park and supported Paolo Nutini at Glasgow Summer Sessions at Bellahouston Park in August 2015. They played a further UK tour throughout September and October culminating in three sold-out appearances at Edinburgh's Liquid Rooms. After this tour, festive dates in Dundee and Glasgow were announced along with a Hogmanay headline show in Glasgow's King Tut's Wah Wah Hut and Edinburgh. The Ropewalk tour will continue throughout January and February 2016 with gigs throughout various European cities before a further UK-wide tour in March and April. In February 2017, the band celebrated their 10th anniversary by playing a record-breaking run of six shows at Glasgow's King Tut's Wah Wah Hut. Tickets for these six shows sold-out in 20 minutes. This was followed by a full UK tour throughout May 2017 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the release of their debut album and also saw the band inducted into the Barrowland Ballroom Hall of Fame. During 2017, the band announced they would be taking a one year hiatus in order to pursue other projects including singer Kyle Falconer's debut solo album. The band played their last show of 2017 on 1 December, to a sold-out crowd, in their hometown of Dundee.

Tietkens was second in command to Ernest Giles on expeditions to Central Australia in 1873 and on a journey from Beltana, South Australia to Perth, Western Australia in 1875. In 1889 Tietkens led his own expedition west of Alice Springs to the vicinity of the Western Australian border. This expedition discovered Lake Macdonald, the Kintore Range, Mount Leisler, Mount Rennie, the Cleland Hills, defined the western borders of Lake Amadeus, and photographed Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (Mount Olga) for the first time. The expedition collected new species of plants and rock samples allowing the South Australian government geologist to compile a 'geological sketch' of the country traversed. Tietkens was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society on his return. Specimens of 250 plant species were collected, although only 8 were new to science, and in 1890, Ferdinand von Mueller and Ralph Tate named Eremophila tietkensii in his honour.

He was an early leader in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Woodson started and helped to build other institutions within the free African-American communities in Ohio and western Pennsylvania prior to the American Civil War. Woodson was among the original 24 trustees to found Wilberforce University in Ohio in 1856, in a collaboration between the AME and the Cincinnati Methodist Council. When the college faced financial difficulties during the American Civil War, the AME Church bought it from the Methodist Church in 1863, making it the first historically black college to be owned and operated by African Americans. Birth and early life Lewis Woodson was the oldest of eleven children born to Thomas and Jemima Woodson, both mixed-race slaves who had gained their freedom. He was born in January 1806 in Greenbrier County, Virginia (now part of West Virginia). Woodson family oral history, dating to the early nineteenth century, has claimed that Thomas Woodson was the eldest child of Sally Hemings and her master President Thomas Jefferson.Byron W. Woodson, Sr., A President in The Family, (Westport CT, Praeger, 2001), 61 That account has been disputed by Jeffersonian historians. Birth certificates were not common until 100 years after Thomas Woodson was born and they were never issued for the birth of slave children. There is no surviving record of Sally Hemings' having given birth to a surviving child before 1795. Professional historians have ignored the erasure of a name of a male slave born in 1790, written into Jefferson's Farm Book by Thomas Jefferson. One letter of the name of the mother of the child survived the erasure. Historians also ignore the newspaper articles of James Callender and others in 1802 and/or the content of articles that are acknowledged. Thomas Woodson was not named Thomas Woodson at birth. Slaves usually did not have a surname.\\"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\\", Plantation & Slvery, Monticello, Quote: \\"The DNA study found no link between the descendants of Field Jefferson [tested because Thomas Jefferson had no direct male descendants] and Thomas C. Woodson... But there is no indication in Jefferson's records of a child born to Hemings before 1795, and there are no known documents to support that Thomas Woodson was Hemings' first child.\\", accessed 6 March 2011. Erasure, Woodson, A President in the Family, 215-17. In addition, results of a 1998 Jefferson DNA study conclusively showed that there was no genetic link between the Jefferson male line and the Woodson male line. The study's major findings were that the Y chromosome of the Jefferson male line matched that of Sally Hemings' son Eston's descendant. The Woodson Y chromosome did show northern European ancestry. The body of the 3rd President, Thomas Jefferson, was not exhumed, thus his DNA (sample) was not tested. Move to Ohio and later to Pittsburgh The Woodson family moved from Virginia to Chillicothe, Ohio about 1821. Chillicothe had a strong community of numerous free blacks, a center of abolitionist activity, and a station on the Underground Railroad. Soon the Woodsons helped establish a black Methodist Episcopal congregation there, the first west of the Allegheny Mountains. Lewis and two brothers, Thomas and John, became ministers in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME),Foner, Phillip and Branham, Robert (eds.), Lift Every Voice: African American Oratory, 1787‚Äì1900 Univ. of Alabama Press, 1997, pp. 384-385 a new, independent, African-American denomination started in Philadelphia in 1816. The Woodsons helped establish new congregations in what was then thought of as the western United States. Lewis Woodson moved with his family to Pittsburgh, PA in 1830/1. Marriage and family In Chillicothe, Lewis Woodson married Caroline Robinson, also born in Virginia. The Woodsons had ten surviving children, many of whom followed their models in gaining education and contributing to their communities. One of the ten Woodson children married a member of the Tanner family and another married a member of the Highgate family, who had lived in Pennsylvania since well before the American Revolution as free black Americans.This is the Tanner family, that produced Henry O. Tanner, who was born in Pittsburgh. Woodson, A President in the Family, 127-8. A son of Lewis and Carline Woodson, Granville S. Woodson served on the Executive Committee of the National Equal Rights League.Samuel W. Black, Jubilee of Freedom, Western Pennsylvania History Winter 2015-16,18-19. https://journals.psu.edu/wph/article/viewFile/60212/60161 Their grandson George Frederick Woodson earned degrees from Drew University and Morris Brown University. He served as Dean of the Payne Theological Seminary at Wilberforce for over three decades, ending in 1937. Their grandson Howard D. Woodson earned a degree in civil engineering from what is now the University of Pittsburgh in 1899. He contributed to the design of Union Station in Washington, D.C. and also became a civic activist. H.D. Woodson High School is named in his honor. Greenwood-Praeger published a highly acclaimed non-fiction best seller in 2001, written by a great-great grandson of Lewis and Carline Woodson. C- Span aired this video of one of the author's presentations. The book covered Woodson family genealogy and history. https://www.c-span.org/video/?165070-1/a-president-family A great-great-great grandson of Lewis and Carline Woodson, Timothy K. Lewis, became a United States District Judge in Pittsburgh in 1991 and became a United States Circuit Judge in 1992.  AME conferences  In 1829 Woodson began an active life of writing to influence public policy, with a letter published by Freedom's Journal, an early African-American newspaper. He denounced proposals for expatriation or colonization of black Americans to Africa, as supported by the American Colonization Society. He advocated separate black communities in the United States. Reverend Lewis Woodson served as secretary for an AME Conference in Hillsborough, Ohio (near Cincinnati) while Bishop Morris Brown presided. The riots of 1829 in Cincinnati had driven out much of the African- American population. Labor competition had led to whites' attacking blacks, who had been establishing a thriving free black community. Nearly 1200 blacks left Cincinnati for Canada as a result.Carter G. Woodson, Charles Harris Wesley, The Negro in Our History, Associated Publishers, 1922, p. 140 (digitized from original at University of Michigan Library), accessed 13 Jan 2009 In Pittsburgh, Woodson joined with John B. Vashon to establish the African Education Society. One of the students in Woodson's school was George Vashon, who was taught by Woodson until black students were allowed to attend publicly financed schools. George Vashon was the first African American to graduate from Oberlin College. Oberlin graduated 23 blacks before the Civil War, making a significant contribution to the uplift of the Antebellum African American community. Martin Delany was also one of Woodson's students. Woodsn's one teacher school was one of the first to be operated by an African American. As Secretary to the AME Ohio Conference of 1833, Woodson advanced a resolution urging the AME to establish or assist \\"...common schools, Sunday Schools and temperance societies...\\" It was the first such resolution to urge the AME denomination to support education. Lewis Woodson filled a key role in the establishment of the Third, or Ohio District, of the AME denomination. The AME Church founded Union Seminary near Columbus, Ohio in 1847. A few years after arriving in Pittsburgh, Lewis Woodson opened a barbershop. He operated the business at the same time he pursued his ministry and major civic interests. Vashon and Woodson befriended the young Martin Delany, and acted as his teachers and mentors. Delany became a spokesman for blacks during the Civil War and helped them to be accepted as soldiers on the Union side. In 1837 Lewis Woodson served as secretary for a group of African Americans who created the \\"Pittsburgh Memorial\\", a document asserting that free blacks should retain the voting right in Pennsylvania. Following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion in Virginia and the growth of the free population in Pennsylvania, fears contributed to support among whites to restrict the rights of free blacks.Eric Ledell Smith, \\"The Pittsburgh Memorial\\", Pittsburgh History, vol. 80, no. 3 (Fall 1997), 106-7 While the legislature deprived free blacks of the right to vote in the Commonwealth for some years, Woodson was instrumental in securing public funding for black education. He joined the Western District of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and worked for abolition. \\"Augustine\\" and the father of Black nationalism The historian Floyd Miller documented that Woodson wrote under the pen name \\"Augustine\\" (the name of an early Christian bishop and theologian from north Africa, who is honored as a saint in the Catholic Church). Miller suggested that in this role, Woodson could be called the \\"Father of Black Nationalism\\".Floyd Miller, \\"The Father of Black Nationalism\\", Civil War History, vol. 17, no. 4 (December 1971) From 1837 to 1841, Woodson published numerous letters as \\"Augustine\\" in The Colored American (New York City) newspaper. He advocated black initiatives to create institutions independent of whites, including churches, newspapers, and schools. Woodson advocated preparing for when the multitudes of American slaves would gain freedom, and require social, organizational, and financial assistance. Woodson attended and organized national and state conventions of black American abolitionists. He attended at least one national convention and spoke there. He helped to organize and lead conventions targeted toward Pennsylvania. One such convention took place in Pittsburgh in August 1841. John B. Vashon and Rev. Samuel Williams also served on the organizing committee for that convention.coloredconventions.org/items/show/240 Woodson also served as one of the secretaries for that convention. He attended conventions where black and white abolitionists gathered, including one in Cincinnati in 1850. Lewis Woodson engaged in debates and ideological clashes with other black American leaders. Woodson joined the American Moral Reform Society (AMRS), but his contribution was that of dissent. AMRS leader William Whipper vehemently opposed the naming of and constitution of organizations and churches on the basis of color and race. Whipper, for instance, did not approve of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the church to which Reverend Woodson was attached. The letters Woodson wrote to the Colored American newspaper were, in part, meant to oppose Whipper's views. Woodson clashed with Frederick Douglass because of Woodson's opposition to Garrisonism. Douglass sent a scathing letter to The Anti-Slavery Bugle wherein Douglass likened Woodson to \\"Judas Iscariot.\\" The Anti Slavery Bugle 24 Aug 1850, accessed newspaper.com 23 June 2018. Douglass' letter exposes several complexities and mixed messages. One lesson the letter exposes is that the Douglass-Garrison split was a process, as the letter seems to find Douglass still in the Garrison camp, though many accounts report 1848 as the beginning of the split. The letter gives further insight into Woodson's life, including corroboration of other evidence, which indicates that Woodson at some point left the A.M.E. for the Wesleyan church, then returned to the A.M.E. This may be the reason why the very prominent minister did not become an A.M.E. bishop. The letter was written before Douglass' split with William Lloyd Garrison was complete. Said another way, after the Douglass/Woodson clash, Douglass' stance came closer to Woodson's (not directly as result of the clash). David Walker's Appeal is a maze of sometimes conflicting ideological statements.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/triumphnationalism/cman/text5/walker.pdf Douglass not only started his own newspaper, but changed his stance and split away for Garrison's ideology. Delany promoted the emigration of black Americans, but did not himself emigrate. Part of Woodson's mark is that he was unwavering; the ideological stances he adopted over 40 years of activism did not change. Woodson never called for a slave uprising, he never supported black American emigration to Africa, and he never supported Garrisonism. It would be a stretch, of course, to claim that the black American ethnicity followed, directly, Woodson, even though his stance and the stance of the majority of black Americans was, over time, consistent. Yet, there is something to that correlation, which can not be easily be captured and stated with assurance.  Establishing Wilberforce University  Along with Bishop Daniel Payne, Woodson was among the four black Americans representing the AME Church; when the 24-member founding Board of Trustees of Wilberforce College first convened in Ohio. They created a collaborative venture with white representatives of the Cincinnati Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which provided the first major funding.Daniel A. Payne, Recollections of Seventy Years, Salem, NH: Ayer Co. Publishers Inc., 1991), 226 The university was opened in 1856 to provide collegiate education to African Americans. Among the trustees was Salmon P. Chase, a strong supporter of abolition and then Governor of Ohio.Horace Talbert, The Sons of Allen: Together with a Sketch of the Rise and Progress of Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio', 1906, p.264-265, Documenting the American South, 2000, University of North Carolina, accessed 25 Jul 2008 The AME representatives were the first African Americans to participate in establishing a historically black college. (The first college for black students, now Lincoln University, was established by Presbyterians, who were aligned with the goals of the American Colonization Society, in Pennsylvania in 1854. No African Americans participated in its founding.) In 1858 Woodson's youngest sister, Sarah Jane Woodson, a graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio, was hired as the first woman to teach at Wilberforce. She became the first African-American woman to teach at any college. The outbreak of the American Civil War cut off paying students from the South, who had comprised a majority of the 200 students at Wilberforce. Most were mixed race; their tuition was paid by their wealthy white planter fathers.James T. Campbell, Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 259-260, accessed 13 Jan 2009 The war also diverted Methodist Church resources, and it was unable to fully fund the school. In 1862 the Board of Trustees temporarily closed Wilberforce University because of financial problems. In 1863 the AME Church purchased the university and assumed full responsibility for it. They selected Bishop Daniel Payne as president, the first African-American college president in the United States. To help raise money for the purchase, the AME Church sold the property used by Union Seminary to put its resources into Wilberforce University. Death, legacy and honors Lewis Woodson died in January 1878. He was buried in the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh, PA. Caroline Woodson, who died after her husband, is buried next to him. One of his obituaries reported his work on the Underground Railroad. Wilberforce University has a strong tradition of teaching the history of its establishment, including the contributions of Lewis Woodson and Daniel A. Payne. The John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh has, since its inception, included the contributions of John B. Vashon, Lewis Woodson and Martin Delany in its exhibition.

He was confronted by a distinct lack of case work. The number of cases handled by the Office had fallen from 1,120 in 1968 to just 548 in 1971. Marre considered that it could be necessary to see if the Office could think of any new way of stimulating some publicity. Marre determined to bring the work of the Office more fully into the public eye and made efforts to respond positively to requests from the press, radio and television for interviews and participation in programmes. Meetings of interested people were addressed by both Marre and his officers. Consequently, there was a growth in case work for the Office.The Ombudsman, Citizen and Parliament, Gregory and Giddings (London, 2002), pp. 173-174. Marre made greater use of his powers under s10(4) Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 to issue special reports. Two instances where such powers were used were in the reports issued into complaints concerning overlapping television licences and the collapse of the Court Line group of companies. Many complaints were made by people who had obtained television licences before the fee was due to be increased on 1 April 1975. The Home Office decided to offer the holders of such 'overlapping' licences a choice between paying the difference between the old and the new licence fee and having their new licences revoked after they had received their money's worth at the old rate. In his investigation, Marre did not feel entitled to question the merits of the decision reached by the Home Office, but did criticise the inefficiency and lack of foresight shown by the Home Office prior to the decision being made. The Home Office accepted Marre's findings and the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, expressed regret for the distress and confusion that had been caused.The Ombudsman, Citizen and Parliament, Gregory and Giddings (London, 2002), pp. 190-191 The report paved the way for a challenge in the Court of Appeal where it was held that the Home Office had acted unlawfully.Congreve v Home Office [1976] QB 629 The Home Office subsequently paid refunds to holders of overlapping licences who had already paid the difference in fees. When the Court Line group collapsed in August 1974, complaints were made to the Ombudsman about statements made in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Industry, Tony Benn. Marre investigated whether the statements by Benn had misled holidaymakers about the safety of their bookings with Court Line when there were rumours that the company was imperilled. This was a reversal of the decision by Sir Edmund Compton in the earlier Duccio case that a ministerial statement was not an instance of administration open to investigation. Marre concluded carefully that in the absence of a qualification to the statements made, the statements were bound to leave a misleading impression with the public and that the Government could not be absolved of all responsibility for losses insured by holidaymakers. Supporters of the Government were critical of the report, arguing that Marre had exceeded his remit as Ombudsman by criticising 'policy' instead of 'administration'. The Government rejected Marre's findings and, in the subsequent debate, the House of Commons split on party lines. The Government won the debate, but the Office enhanced its credibility in demonstrating both its independence and its ability to criticise a Minister.The Ombudsman, Citizen and Parliament, Gregory and Giddings (London, 2002), pp. 191-198. Marre was also appointed as the first Health Service Commissioner for England, Scotland and Wales when the National Health Service Reorganisation Act 1973 came into force. This followed pressure from within Parliament from those who had sought to include health matters within the remit of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 and from those members of the public who were dissatisfied with the existing complaints handling procedure. Marre assumed this new post in October 1973 and was empowered to investigate maladministration and service failures by hospitals. Matters of clinical judgment were noticeably outside his remit. Marre recruited a mixture of civil servants and medical staff for the new posts created for the Health Ombudsman. He also sought publicity for his new responsibilities but still observed that his functions were still not widely enough known and understood.Health Service Commissioner, 1973-1974 Annual Report, p. 10. Marre instituted a two-stage procedure for health investigations: a screening stage and a subsequent stage where the Ombudsman would determine the form of the investigation. By the end of his tenure as Ombudsman, Marre had firmly established the Office as a fundamental feature of complaints about the National Health Service. Retirement In retirement, Marre engaged in a number of charitable and public activities. He served as the Chairman of Age Concern England between 1977 and 1980 and of the British Nutritional Foundation between 1981 and 1990. He was also a trustee of the Whitechapel Art Gallery between 1977 and 1983. Although Marre had not been a practising Jew, he gave some of his time to Jewish social and cultural causes, becoming President of the Maccabaeans in 1982. Sir Alan Marre died in 1990.

The collection exhibited is part of the Dal√≠ Universe collection, curated by Beniamino Levi, Italian gallerist and collector. Sculptures such as Space Elephant and Alice in Wonderland are presented, and the visitor can also see other aspects such as Moses and monotheism, Memories of Surrealism, Don Quixote, etc. Music plays in the background, and there are creative workshops for children to give them the opportunity to become familiar with Dal√≠'s art. Adjacent to the museum are two art galleries: the Galerie Dal√≠ which presents a selection of some of the artist's works (sculptures, engravings and lithographs), and the Galerie Montmartre, which shows the works of several contemporary artists.

Beyond the creative process, what brings these creators close to one another is their unique way of revealing the world: provocative, iconoclastic and wild. Just like Dal√≠, street artists are limitless when it comes to their sources of inspiration and convictions, the materiel and the mediums they use. About twenty urban artists have met the challenge. In dialogue with the works exhibited at Espace Dal√≠, each of them created an artwork which dares to confront the surrealist universe with the vocabulary and the codes of urban art: painting, stencil, design, light painting, sound and installation.http://daliparis.com/fr/expositions/exposition/1/Dali-fait-le-mur *2015 : Daum, Variations d'Artistes - Who could bring together in the same exhibition the following artists: Arman, Ben, C√©sar, Paella Chimicos, Louis Derbr√©, Etienne, Carlos Mata, Hilton McConnico, J√©r√¥me Mesnager, Alain S√©chas, Richard Texier‚Ä¶ and Salvador Dal√≠?

It was the first British biotech company to be publicly listed when it was floated on 1 July 1992. Controversy In 1996, despite having no compounds on or near the market, the company was temporarily valued at nearly $2.5 billion, largely on the basis of its two main development drugs: marimastat (a novel matrix metalloprotease inhibitor for cancer treatment) and zacutex (for pancreatitis). Batimastat (codename BB94) progressed as far as stage 3 in its clinical trial, although not orally bioavailable, there are other methods of administration, including transdermal. In February 1998, Dr Andrew Millar was dismissed as Head of Clinical Research and went on to make allegations that \\"the Board were running a business plan consistent only with extreme and unfounded optimism\\". For example, the eponym Batimastat, \\"batty\\" means a crazy/eccentric person. Not a good selection. These events were the subject of an inquiry by the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology in August 1998 which absolved Dr Millar of any responsibility for the company's problems. Subsequent investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Food and Drug Administration, London Stock Exchange and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency found that British Biotech had wilfully misled the public about the progress of marimastat and that unblinding data before the end of clinical trials does not necessarily invalidate the results. Marimastat underwent Phase III trials in collaboration with Schering-Plough Corporation. Further development of zacutex was abandoned due to poor clinical trial results. The corporate politics behind the downfall of British Biotech was later recorded for a BBC2 Series Blood on the Carpet.  Disappearance  In 2003, British Biotech merged with RiboTargets and then into Vernalis Group. The British Biotech company name disappeared after this merger and remaining staff integrated into the new Vernalis plc organisation in Winnersh, Berkshire.

Drafted into the Red Army in 1919, Shafranov fought in the Russian Civil War as an infantryman. During the 1920s he became a junior commander in artillery units and served in artillery staff positions during the late 1930s. After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, he was sent to command an artillery regiment and in late 1941 became commander of the artillery of the 249th Rifle Division, which became the 16th Guards Rifle Division. Shafranov commanded the latter between 1942 and 1943, the 36th Guards Rifle Corps from 1943 to 1944, the 5th Army for a brief period in late 1944, and the 31st Army from January 1945. For his leadership of the 31st Army in the East Prussian Offensive, Shafranov was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. Postwar, he served in command positions in the National Air Defense Forces and ended his career as representative of the Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization to the Hungarian People's Republic, retiring in 1965.  Early life, Russian Civil War, and interwar period  Shafranov was born on in the village of Bolshoye Frolovoye, Tetyushsky Uyezd, Kazan Governorate (now in Buinsky District, Tatarstan) to a peasant family. He attended primary school in Tetyushi and left for Tsaritsyn in 1914, where he worked until 1917 as a sailor and helmsman. During the Russian Civil War, he was drafted into the Red Army in October 1919 and was initially sent to the 4th Reserve Rifle Regiment in Kazan as a Red Army man. Shafranov was transferred to the 112th Rifle Regiment of the 13th Rifle Division, with which he fought on the Western Front against Latvian and Finnish troops. From July 1920, he served as a squad leader in the 131st Rifle Regiment of the 15th Rifle Division. With the latter, Shafranov fought against the Army of Wrangel in the Kakhovka bridgehead, the Northern Taurida Offensive, and the Perekop‚ÄìChongar Operation. After the defeat of Wrangel, Shafranov became a Red Army man in a lettered company of the 15th Rifle Division in May 1921. Entering the 6th Saratov Artillery Courses in September 1921, he fought as a squad leader on the Turkestan Front against the Basmachi movement between May and November 1922 with a student detachment. Upon graduation from the courses in February 1923, Shafranov became a gun commander and assistant platoon commander in the artillery battalion of the 44th Rifle Division, stationed at Zhytomyr. He became a platoon commander and assistant battery commander in the 99th Artillery Regiment at Cherkasy in October of that year. Shafranov studied at the Kiev Artillery School from October 1926, before being transferred to the Sumy Artillery School, where he served as starshina of the cadet battery. Upon graduation in March 1928, he was sent to the 56th Artillery Regiment of the Leningrad Military District in Pskov, serving as a battery commander and head of the regimental school. Shafranov studied at the F.E. Dzerzhinsky Military-Technical Academy of the Red Army (renamed the F.E. Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy of the Red Army in 1932) from June 1930, and after graduation in November 1934 became an adjunct (graduate student) at the academy. From May 1935 he served in the Main Artillery Directorate of the Red Army as an engineer of the highest qualification before becoming a department head at the directorate in September 1937. Shafranov served as a head of a sector and department at the Defense Committee of the Council of People's Commissars from July 1938.  World War II  After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, in June 1941, Shafranov was given command of the 778th Artillery Regiment of the 247th Rifle Division of the 31st Army of the Reserve Front in July. From October he was chief of artillery of the 249th Rifle Division, fighting with the 22nd and 4th Shock Armies on the Kalinin and Northwestern Fronts. In fighting for Peno, Andreapol, Toropets, and Velizh during January and February 1942, Shafranov was credited with \\"skillfully organizing artillery-infantry cooperation and artillery fire support\\", for which he received the Order of the Red Banner on 31 January 1942. He continued in his position after the 249th was converted into the 16th Guards Rifle Division in March. Shafranov, by this time a colonel, became commander of the division on 16 August, and was promoted to major general on 27 November. He led the division in defensive battles in the Staritsa area as part of the 30th Army of the Western Front until February 1943. During March, in the Rzhev‚ÄìVyazma Strategic Offensive, Shafranov, promoted to major general, \\"skillfully organized the breakthrough of forward enemy defenses\\" before the division crossed the Volga and captured Rzhev. Subsequently, with the 11th Guards Army of the Bryansk Front, he led the division in Operation Kutuzov and the battles for Karachev and Gorodok in mid-1943. For the \\"successful performance of combat missions\\" in Operation Kutuzov, Shafranov was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class. Appointed commander of the 36th Guards Rifle Corps in early September, Shafranov led the latter as part of the 11th Guards Army with the Bryansk, 2nd and 1st Baltic, and 3rd Belorussian Fronts during the offensives of 1943 and 1944. For his \\"skillful leadership\\" of the corps in the late June 1944 Vitebsk‚ÄìOrsha Offensive of Operation Bagration, during which it made a flank maneuver and captured the rail junction of Orsha, he was awarded the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd class. During the July Kaunas Offensive, the corps crossed the Neman and advanced in three days, capturing Kalvarija. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 13 September. Given command of the 5th Army of the 3rd Belorussian Front on 16 October, Shafranov transferred to command the 31st Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front on 15 December, leading the latter for the rest of the war. Under his command, the army fought in the East Prussian Offensive, capturing Schirwindt, Labiau, Wehlau, and Tapiau, which covered the approaches to K√∂nigsberg. Continuing the offensive, the army captured Heiligenbeil, the last German stronghold on the coast of the Frisches Haff to the south of K√∂nigsberg, and completed the destruction of the surrounded German troops in East Prussia during March. For his \\"skillful leadership\\", Shafranov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 19 April 1945. He ended the war in the Prague Offensive in early May.  Postwar  After the end of the war, Shafranov continued to command the army. In August 1948, he graduated from Higher Academic Courses at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy and became commander of the troops of the Donbass Air Defense Region. After successively commanding the Baku Air Defense Region from June 1952 and the Ural Air Defense Region from April 1954, Shafranov commanded the Ural Air Defense Army between 1954 and 1955, while simultaneously serving as deputy commander of the troops of the Ural Military District for air defense. From May 1955 he served as deputy commander of the troops of the Transcaucasian Military District for air defense before becoming head of the air defense department of the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy in July 1956. Transferred to become head of the Military Command Academy of the Air Defense Forces in December of that year, Shafranov was promoted to colonel general in 1958. He became chief military advisor to the Hungarian People's Army in November 1959.

It shares the common name 'barbel' with its many relatives in the genus Barbus, of which it is the type species. In Great Britain it is usually referred to simply as the barbel; similar names are used elsewhere in Europe, such as barbeau in France and flodbarb in Sweden. The name derives from the four whiskerlike structures located at the corners of the fish's mouth, which it uses to locate food. Distribution and habitat B. barbus is native throughout northern and eastern Europe, ranging north and east from the Pyr√©n√©es and Alps to Lithuania, Russia and the northern Black Sea basin. It is an adaptable fish which transplants well between waterways, and has become established as an introduced species in several countries including Scotland, Morocco and Italy. Although barbel are native to eastern flowing rivers in England, they have historically been translocated to western flowing rivers, such as the River Severn. Its favoured habitats are the so- called barbel zones in fast-flowing rivers with gravel or stone bottoms, although it regularly occurs in slower rivers and has been successfully stocked in stillwaters. Barbel are very abundant in some rivers, often seen in large shoals on rivers such as the Wye. Izaak Walton reported that there were once so many barbel in the Danube that they could be caught by hand, 'eight or ten load at a time' .  Ecology  Juvenile barbel Adult B. barbus specimens can reach 1.2 m (4 ft) in length and 12 kg (26 lb) in weight, although it is typically found at smaller sizes (50‚Äì100 cm length, weight 1‚Äì3 kg). Adult barbel can live to over 20 years of age. Their sloping foreheads, flattened undersides, slender bodies and horizontally oriented pectoral fins are all adaptations for their life in swift, deep rivers, helping to keep them close to the riverbed in very strong flows. Juvenile fish are usually grey and mottled in appearance; adults are typically dark brown, bronze or grey in colour with a pale underside, with distinctively reddish or orange-tinged fins. The lobes of the tail are asymmetrical, the lower lobe being rounded and slightly shorter than the pointed upper lobe. Barbel are active fish and often travel long distances in quite short time periods. Individuals can move between 16 and 68 km in a year, with mean (average) daily movement between 26 and 139m. Adults commonly feed at night, although they may feed during the daytime in the safety of deeper water or near bankside cover and underwater obstructions. Their underslung mouths make them especially well adapted for feeding on benthic organisms, including crustaceans, insect larvae and mollusks, which they root out from the gravel and stones of the riverbed. Barbel diets change as the fish develop from fry to juveniles and then to adults. Diatoms that cover rocks and the larvae of non-biting midges (Chironomidae) are particularly important foods for young fish. Males become mature after three to four years, females after five to eight years. Spawning occurs between May and late June on most rivers, when groups of males assemble in shallow water in pursuit of mates. Upstream migration to reach spawning grounds typically occurs between March and May, depending on water temperature. Like many fish species, male barbel develop distinctive tubercles on their heads prior to spawning. Females produce between 8,000 and 12,000 eggs per kilogram of bodyweight, which are fertilised by males as they are released and deposited in shallow excavations in the gravel of the riverbed. Parasites of Barbus barbus include Aspidogaster limacoides, a trematode flatworm;Schludermann C., Laimgruber S., Konecny R. & Schabuss M. (2005). \\"Aspidogaster limacoides DIESING, 1835 (Trematoda, Aspidogastridae): A new parasite of Barbus barbus (L.) (Pisces, Cyprinidae) in Austria\\". Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien 106B: 141-144 Eustrongylides sp, a nematode; and Pomphorhynchus laevis, an acanthocephalan worm. As food Many authors have noted the highly toxic nature of barbel roe when eaten by humans, including Dame Juliana Berners and Charles David Badham. Badham relates the experience of Italian physician Antonio Gazius, who, he says, \\"took two boluses, and thus describes his sensations: 'At first I felt no inconvenience, but some hours having elapsed, I began to be disagreeably affected, and as my stomach swelled, and could not be brought down again by anise or carminatives, I was soon in a state of great depression and distress.' His countenance was pallid, like a man in a swoon, deadly coldness ensued, violent cholera and vomiting came after until the roe was passed, and then he became all right.\\" Despite the risks associated with eating barbel and its roe during the spawning season, several notable cookery authors have included recipes for barbel in their books. Mrs Beeton, for example, writes that they are in season in the winter months, and suggests simmering them with port and herbs.  Recreational importance  A specimen barbel from the River Wye, England. The common barbel is a popular sport fish throughout its range, long prized by anglers for its power and stamina. Izaak Walton noted that \\"he will often break both rod and line if he proves to be a big one ... the Barbel affords an angler choice sport, being a lusty and a cunning fish; so lusty and cunning as to endanger the breaking of the angler's line, by running his head forcibly towards any covert, or hole, or bank, and then striking at the line, to break it off, with his tail\\". Barbel fishing is especially popular in the UK, where it reaches a weight of over . A fish of more than is considered to be of specimen size. Famous UK barbel rivers include the Hampshire Avon, Dorset Stour, Trent, Kennet, Wye, Severn, and Great Ouse. Several angling societies exist in the UK which specifically promote the pursuit and conservation of the species, including the Barbel Society and the Barbel Catchers Club. Barbel conservation is important, for although populations appear robust in some larger river systems, localised populations can be vulnerable to environmental factors. For example, the relatively small River Wensum in the county of Norfolk was of national importance to barbel anglers from the 1970s until the early 2000s, at one time producing the British record fish. But in recent years the reintroduction of otters in the river catchment (together with siltation of spawning gravels) has had a devastating effect on the barbel population as they are easy to catch in the shallow, clear river. Now only a fragmented population remains, and barbel may be on their way to local extinction. Baits for catching barbel vary widely according to local practices and conditions. In the UK, popular baits include tinned luncheon meat, fishmeal-based pellets, hemp seed, maggots, and boilies. In areas with high angling activity fishmeal-based pellets could constitute up to 71% of the barbel diet. In France, many anglers still use natural baits, especially caddis larvae, which they collect from the stones and gravel near the fish's feeding areas.

As living so far away from Bengal was bearing upon him he joined Edward College at Pabna as professor of philosophy, before opting to be a missionary of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. As a missionary, he travelled extensively to Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai on lecture tours. He was conferred the title of Vedantabagish for his vast erudition in the Vedas and philosophy. Amongst the books he wrote were: Sanskar O Sanrakshan, Mahapurush Prasanga, Dharmer Tattwa O Sadhan, Maitrupanishad and In Search of Jesus Christ. Later life He settled down at Hazaribagh in later life and followed Mahesh Chandra Ghosh as secretary of Hazaribagh Brahmo Samaj in 1930. After serving for four years, he handed over responsibility of the position to another great missionary, Manmathanath Gupta. In those days, Hazaribagh had a lively Brahmo community with such local devotees as Braja Kumar Niyogi, Kharga Singha Ghosh and Khsitish Chandra Ghosh, and a host of people from Kolkata who went and stayed there or visited regularly.

Similar bans had already been introduced by the rest of the United Kingdom: in Scotland on 26 March 2006, Wales on 2 April 2007 and Northern Ireland on 30 April 2007. Before the smoking ban Before the ban, smoking was commonplace in pubs Before the ban many businesses voluntarily introduced bans on smoking mainly as a result of public feedback. The pub chain Wetherspoons was the first major chain to introduce a complete ban on indoor smoking, doing so in May 2006. Tobacco advertising had been banned in England gradually starting with a ban on television advertising of cigarettes in 1965 to a complete ban on all tobacco advertising in 2005. Passage of the law On 16 November 2004 a Public Health white paper proposed a smoking ban in almost all public places in England and Wales. Smoking restrictions would be phased in, with a ban on smoking in NHS and government buildings by 2006, in enclosed public places by 2007, and pubs, bars and restaurants (except pubs not serving food) by the end of 2008. On 26 October 2005, after external challenge and debates within the Cabinet, the government announced that it would continue with its plans. All workplaces, including restaurants and pubs selling food, would have to comply by summer 2007 However, there was widespread criticism from all sides of the argument on this, with a number of MPs threatening to try to overturn the bill. Many representatives of the licensed trade told the Government that only a total ban would work, and over 90 MPs signed a motion demanding this, with over 100 signing a petition for a free vote on the issue. It was reported on 24 November that Chief Medical Officer Liam Donaldson nearly quit over the partial ban, but decided to stay to champion a total ban. On the same day, the government released the results of the public consultation, after Cancer Research UK demanded them under the Freedom of Information Act, which revealed that nearly 9 out of 10 respondents wanted a total ban. On 11 January 2006, the government further announced that it would give MPs a free vote on an amendment to the Health Bill, submitted by the Health select committee, to instigate a comprehensive smoke-free workplace regulations. Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt voted in favour of the amendment and, in so doing, voted against her own Department's then publicly stated policy (i.e. the proposed partial regulations). All other parties had offered free votes on the issue which was debated on 14 February, with three options: the present compromise, a total ban, or an exemption for members' clubs only. On 14 February 2006, the House of Commons first voted on the amendment to the original compromise plan, to extend the ban to all enclosed public places except private members' clubs. The amendment was carried with a large majority. MPs then voted on a further amendment to ban smoking in all enclosed public places including private members' clubs. Again this amendment gained significant support and was carried with a large majority. This therefore replaced the earlier successful amendment which would have allowed smoking only in private members' clubs. The legislation was passed by the House of Lords, allowing a total smoking ban in enclosed public places to come into force in England. Political opposition did not entirely disappear at this point, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee accused the Government of overreacting to the threat posed by passive smoking and said that the smoking ban was symptomatic of MPs' failure to understand riskhttps://www.webcitation.org/5tkNlefMT?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article672477.ece on 7 June 2006. Implementation The ban came into force at 06:00 BST on 1 July 2007, as announced on 30 November 2006 by former Secretary of State for Health Patricia Hewitt, who called it \\"a huge step forward for public health\\". A legal blunder however by Stoke-on-Trent City Council meant that, while the smoking ban still applied in the city, the council were unable to issue fines to people caught flouting the law until 16 July 2007. The blunder caused the city to briefly be dubbed Smoke-on-Trent. Following the passing of the law Many pubs provide smoking areas outdoors, where smoking remains generally permitted. A smoking shelter outside an office building in England. Since 2007 such shelters have become commonplace at workplaces. On 30 June 2010, the recently formed Coalition Government announced that it would not be reviewing the ban. An attempt in October 2010 by Conservative MP David Nuttall to amend the law to exempt private members' clubs and pubs from the smoking ban was defeated in the House of Commons on its first reading. Exemptions from the law While the ban affects almost all indoor workplaces, some exemptions were provided: * designated hotel rooms * designated rooms in nursing homes * designated rooms in prisons * designated rooms in offshore oil rigs * designated rooms in mental health units (until 1 July 2008) * specialist tobacconists in relation to sampling cigars and/or pipe tobacco. An exemption was also theoretically possible within the Palace of Westminster, as for other Royal Palaces, although members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords agreed to observe the spirit of the ban and restrict any smoking within the grounds of Parliament to four designated outside areas. Smoking is permitted in a private residence, although not in areas used as a shared work-space. In flats with communal entrances or shared corridors, these must be smoke-free. University halls of residence presented some dilemmas in practice as regards defining what is public and private. Several universities have imposed a blanket ban on smoking including halls of residence. Public transport As part of the implementation of the smoking ban, Transport for London announced that smoking would be no longer permitted in taxis, private hire vehicles and all London Buses premises, including all bus stop shelters. The Association of Train Operating Companies and Network Rail introduced an extended ban on smoking covering all railway property including all National Rail station platforms whether enclosed or not. The ban has since been extended to cover the use of Electronic cigarettes. Smoking on board trains was banned in 2005 when both GNER and First Caledonian Sleeper withdrew smoking accommodation from their services. The Tyne and Wear Metro was the first public transport system to ban in its entirety which has been enforced since the system first opened in 1980. Policing of the ban The ban is enforced by Environmental Health Officers in England, who issue warnings and offer advice before resorting to punitive measures and have had to issue a low frequency of fines since the law came into force. However, there were some objectors who generated higher-profile legal cases, for instance Hugh Howitt, also known as Hamish Howitt, the landlord of the Happy Scots Bar in Blackpool who was the first landlord to be prosecuted for permitting smoking in a smoke-free place under his control. On 2 August 2007, Howitt appeared before Blackpool Magistrates' Court and pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of failing to stop people smoking in his pub. On 2 December 2008, Howitt effectively had his premises licence revoked, after an appeal by Blackpool Council was upheld; he was not allowed to appeal, and Howitt had to close the Delboys Bar following the decision. There have been some incidents of violence perpetrated by people refusing to obey the ban, in one of which a former heavyweight boxer, James Oyebola, was shot in the head after he asked patrons at a nightclub to stop smoking and later died of his injuries. However, the view of enforcement authorities is that the smoke-free workplace regulations are simple to understand, popular, and as a result largely 'self-policing'. For a short while, bars in the UK that offered shisha (the smoking of flavoured tobacco through a pipe) were still allowed to provide their services inside the establishment, however the ban covered this area in late 2007 leading to a rapid decline in shisha bars. Reaction to the ban A group calling themselves \\"Freedom To Choose\\" launched a campaign for a judicial review of the smoke-free workplace regulations claiming a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998, as it does not respect the right to privacy of people who wish to smoke in public. Supporters of the regulations put forward counter-arguments positing that the rights of smokers to indulge in their habit cease as soon as it negatively affects other people in the vicinity. In 2010, pub landlord Nick Hogan was briefly jailed for an offence related to the smoking ban. In 2012, it was reported that \\"Five years after the introduction of the smoking ban in England, almost seven out of 10 licensees want the legislation amended to allow for separate smoking rooms in pubs\\". A 2017 YouGov survey indicated growing support for the smoking ban, up to 83% from the 2007 figure of 78%. This was attributed to more smokers supporting the legislation.

Sliding doors can be mounted either on top of a track below or be suspended from a track above and some types 'disappear' in a wall when slid open. There are several types of sliding doors such as pocket doors, Arcadia doors, and bypass doors. Sliding doors are commonly used as shower doors, glass doors, screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans. History Sliding doors were used as early as the first century CE in Roman houses as evidenced by archaeological finds in Pompeii, Italy, but there is no evidence to affirm or deny that the Romans were the first people to have invented or used sliding doors. Sliding door gear The mechanism used to operate a sliding door is called sliding door gear. There are two standard types, top hung or bottom rolling systems. Both types do not have a perfect seal. To reduce air- and smoke-tightness and sound insulation, brush seals are commonly used. =Top hung sliding doors= Some sliding doors run on a wall-mounted rail, like this one Sliding doors in a modern wardrobe The 'top hung' system is most often used. The door is hung by two trolley hangers at the top of the door running in a concealed track; all the weight is taken by the hangers, making the door easier to move. At each end is a track stopper to absorb any impact made if the door is slammed and to hold the door in the open or closed position. All top hung sliding door gear systems have a maximum weight limit per pair of trolley hangers. When specifying a suitable sliding system the estimated weight of the door is a critical factor, although most suppliers of sliding door gear can advise on door weights As the door is hung at the top from two points, it also needs a bottom track/stay roller to prevent it from swinging sideways. The most common type is called 'clear threshold guiding', a floor- fixed plastic guide about 60mm wide which is fixed below the door at the midpoint of its run. A groove is cut into the bottom of the door which runs over this guide, preventing lateral movement of the door. With a glass door the panel runs through the guide as illustrated. Because the door is always engaged in the guide, when the door is open the floor is clear, hence 'clear threshold'. Several examples of free-standing top-hung sliding-door wardrobes can be seen on several websites. The mechanisms are safe, and the bottom of the doors is held in place on tracks. The rollers also have safety locks that prevent the doors from jumping off the tracks. Additional features such as soft closers or dampners can be added to further enhance the feel and usability of these products. A popular top-hung sliding door type is the barn door, inspired from countryside barns, in modern homes of Scandinavian styles. =Bottom rolling door gear= Sometimes a top hung system cannot be used, as the weight of the door cannot be supported from above; in this case a bottom rolling system is recommended. A bottom rolling system consists of two rollers (sometimes called a sheave) at the bottom of the door running on a track and two guides at the top running in a guide channel. As all the weight of the door is concentrated on the two bottom wheels, more force is needed to move the door than on a top hung system.; (cite a reference for this assertion) =Lift-and-slide door gear= A sliding door that is lifted from the frame during opening and closing is called a lift-and-slide door. This allows for a better seal, with less draught and better soundproving. Automatic sliding doors Automatic door in Hong Kong Some sliding doors contain a motor and activation system to open them. These are called sliding door operators. Automatic sliding doors are commonly found in offices and shop entrances. These doors contain a magnetic locking mechanism that automatically unlocks during emergencies. Usage Advantages of sliding doors are that there is almost no room required to open the door, they are relatively easy to automate. The mechanism is also secure, since it cannot be lifted out of its hinges. Sliding doors are commonly found as store-, hotel- and office entrances, elevators, patios doors, closet doors and room dividers. Transport industries also use sliding doors in vans, trains and metro. Volkswagen used these doors in Volkswagen Fridolin produced between 1964 and 1974.

Before the Act, incorporation was possible only by royal charter or private Act and was limited owing to Parliament's protection of the privileges and advantages thereby granted. As a result, many businesses came to be operated as unincorporated associations with possibly thousands of members. Any consequent litigation had to be carried out in the joint names of all the members and was almost impossibly cumbersome. Though Parliament would sometimes grant a private act to allow an individual to represent the whole in legal proceedings, this was a narrow and necessarily costly expedient, allowed only to established companies. The 1844 Act created the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, empowered to register companies by a two-stage process. The first, provisional, stage cost ¬£5 () and did not confer corporate status, which arose after completing the second stage for another ¬£5.Mayson et al. (2005) p. 6.

Biography Decaro's biographical information is sparse, and many canvases refer to painter of Neapolitan origin, active between 1740 and 1761. His name was known only from the autograph on the canvases. Decaro is known to have married the 22-year-old Anna Mariana Bozza on 28 February 1743. The couple had 10 children. According to a ‚Äúcensus‚Äù of the local parish in 1757, the painter‚Äôs studio was in Vicolo della Porta piccola del Rosario, a narrow street between the areas of Chiaia and the Spanish Quarter. Decaro lived and worked at that address, according to recently discovered documentation in the archives of the Banco di Napoli, reflecting the ‚Äúpublic banks of Naples‚Äù. The records of the Banco San Giacomo include receipts of rent payments made by the painter in 1768 and 1769 to his landlord, the Prince of Cannito, for ‚Äútwo rooms and cellar on the ground floor of the house of the aforesaid Prince in the Sant‚ÄôAnna di Palazzo road‚Äù.

Founded in 1982 by British ad men John Bartle, Nigel Bogle, and John Hegarty, BBH has offices in London, New York City, Singapore, Shanghai, Mumbai, Stockholm and Los Angeles and employs more than 1,000 staff worldwide. The company is part of international agency group Publicis. In 2018 BBH was named the IPA Effectiveness Company of the Year. History The agency's first ad was for Levi's and it showed a black sheep going against the herd. It became the agency icon and spawned the phrase, \\"when the world zigs, zag\\". The Levi's black sheep poster was not an easy ad to buy because at the time all jeans ads had people in them, but it proved successful. Over the next 28 years, BBH went on to produce many award-winning films for Levi's. \\"Launderette\\" featured Nick Kamen and was set to Marvin Gaye's recording of 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine'. Levi's sold over 2 million boxer shorts in one year. In 1991, BBH cast the then-unknown Brad Pitt in the Levi's commercial titled \\"Camera.\\" Other classic work includes \\"Drugstore\\", \\"Creek\\", \\"Flatbeat\\" featuring Flat Eric ‚Äì a small yellow puppet, \\"Clayman\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" which was directed by Jonathan Glazer. The 28-year relationship resulted in a total of seven number one singles in Europe. Beyond Levi's, the company been responsible for creating long-running campaigns for other global brands, such as ' for Audi which John Hegarty coined in 1984, \\"The Lynx Effect\\" for Unilever which propelled the male body spray into the number one spot globally and \\"Keep Walking\\" for Johnnie Walker which bought the brand sales up from 13% of the global market when the campaign broke in 2000, to over 20% at the end of 2013 according to IWSR.

Labor disputes On September 20, 2018, the American labor union SAG-AFTRA called a strike against Bartle Bogle Hegarty, and instructed its members not to accept work from the agency. In early September, BBH announced that it had withdrawn from its SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract, first entered into in 1999. BBH had contended that the union's contractual terms, which do not permit the use of non-union actors and provide for compensation minimums and residuals, put the agency at a competitive disadvantage, stating that \\"Many of our peer agencies are not signatories.\\" SAG-AFTRA countered that it had added certain waivers for low-budget commercials, among other provisions, to its contract language, in response to concerns about profitability. The union also said that the strike was against BBH only, and not other subsidiaries of the Publicis Group, including Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, who are themselves signatories of the contract at issue.

The classification is not known to authors before the 18th century. It is part of an effort to create a formal canon for ayurvedic literature. There are older medical encyclopedias than are not included in the B·πõhat-Trayƒ´, for example the Bhe·∏∑a-sa·πÉhitƒÅ. Overview The following three works constitute the B·πõhat-Trayƒ´: * Charaka Samhita (‡§ö‡§∞‡§ï‡§∏‡§Ç‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡§æ) was composed by Agnivesa (‡§Ö‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•á‡§∂) and later edited by Charaka (‡§ö‡§∞‡§ï). * Sushruta Samhita (‡§∏‡•Å‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§§‡§∏‡§Ç‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡§æ) was composed by Sushruta (‡§∏‡•Å‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§§). * Ashtanga Hridayam Samhita (‡§Ö‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§ô‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§Ø‡§∏‡§Ç‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡§æ) was composed by Vagbhata (‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§≠‡§ü) (fl. ca. AD 610, in Sindh). A work called A·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-sa·πÉgraha (‡§Ö‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§ô‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π) is also ascribed to the last author, VƒÅgbha·π≠a ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§≠‡§ü. It is a more diffuse work than the A·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-h·πõdaya-sa·πÉhitƒÅ, and is in mixed prose and verse (the Ashtanga Hridayam is in verse only). These two works are versions of the same material, but their exact relationship, authorship and priority is still debated by scholars. There are thousands of medieval manuscripts of the Ashtanga Hridayam in archives and libraries across India, while the A·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga Sa·πÉgraha is rare, having survived to the 20th century in only a few partial copies. It is thus clear that the Ashtanga Hridayam is the text that was most widely studied in pre-modern times, and was in fact the standard textbook of ayurveda for several hundred years. In spite of this, probably through a misunderstanding some time in the early 20th century, it is the A·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga- sa·πÉgraha that is primarily taught as part of the modern ayurvedic BAMS syllabus at Government ayurvedic colleges. The B·πõhat-Trayƒ´ or \\"Triad of the Great\\" is also sometimes called the V·πõddha-Trayƒ´, which means \\"the triad of the old/mature (classics or authors)\\". All three works have been published in numerous Sanskrit editions, and all have been translated into English more than once. The English translations of P. V. Sharma and of Srikanthamurthy are considered among the better ones. The German translation of the Ashtanga Hridayam by Hilgenberg and Kirfel is widely considered the very best and scholarly translation available. References * G. J.

Organization The council has four districts: *Tamanend District (Lower Bucks County) *Tohickon District (Upper Bucks County) *Hunterdon Arrowhead District (Hunterdon County, NJ) *Mercer Area District (Mercer County, NJ and small portions of Middlesex and Somerset Counties, NJ) Camps =Ockanickon Scout Reservation= Ockanickon Scout Reservation is located in Pipersville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The camp was founded in 1941 and named after a Lenape chief who assisted William Penn in the exploration of the Bucks Country area. The camp is run as a weekend camp during spring, fall and winter, and as a full-time summer camp during the summer. There are fifteen separate camp sites, and a wide range of activities and programs including the first ever Scout Science Center. Camp Ockanickon contains 15 campsites which are available to troops during the summer, and a sixteenth which is occupied by staff during the summer but is available for camping during the off-season. Currently, the camp hosts about five hundred Scouts and adult leaders during each of eight weeks of summer camp. Camp Ockanickon is notable for the GE Betz Science center, its air- conditioned dining hall, and the numerous awards it has received from the BSA National Office for excellence. Facilities ;GE Betz Science Center The GE Betz Science Center , came about when the Betz Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Betz Laboratories, Inc. (later acquired by General Electric), granted Camp Ockanickon money to establish a program in which to teach science merit badges. GE continues to support the science center with annual contributions dedicated to upkeep of the center. Besides being the first of its kind, the science center is notable for: * A room-sized inflatable planetarium for use in merit badges such as Astronomy and Weather * A collection of telescopes, also for merit badges use and open Star Gazing * A real-time weather station * Copious amounts of liquid nitrogen used for demonstrations and merit badge support * \\"The Eagle\\": A tribute to Eagle Scouts, all Eagle Scouts that enter the science center are asked to sign the guest book below the Eagle. The Eagle was a donation from GE Water and Process Technologies to the Science Center. * Amateur Radio Station KB3BOY designed to help Scouts earn Radio Merit Badge and participate in Jamboree On The Air. Future plans for the science center include an observatory with a 19\\" telescope. ;Other departments * The Ecology department offers nature and conservation merit badges. The Ecology lodge is home to the largest turkey ever shot in Bucks County. A hunter who accidentally shot the bird on Ockanickon's property decided to donate it in exchange for dropping poaching charges. A traffic light in the highest window of the lodge shows how many fires are allowed in camp: a red light means a total ban on fires, a yellow light means one small fire per campsite, and a green light (only ever used during heavy rain) means no limit on fires. The rule is not always followed because a lot of times in the summer, two troops will occupy one campsite and each will have their own fire. * Scoutcraft offers programs and merit badges related to camping, wilderness survival, and other wilderness skills. * Dan Beard is a program designed for first year campers, who are focused more on learning the basic Scouting skills required for 1st Class rank than on earning merit badges. The Dan Beard program does offer two merit badges: Swimming and Art to its fit badges which are required for the rank of Eagle Scout, but which do not fit neatly with any other departments at camp. The department is for first year campers. *Located in Memorial Lodge, the Civics department teaches badges such as Citizenship in the Nation, American Heritage, and Entrepreneurship. * The Aquatics department is in charge of the pool, where Swimming and Lifesaving are taught, and the lake, where Canoeing, Kayaking, and Rowing merit badges are taught. Aquatics also offers a Scuba program and moderates the Water Carnival. Because it has multiple areas of responsibility, each of which is very popular on hot summer days, this is the largest department in the camp. * Adventure Sports (formerly Spoke n' Rope) is a high adventure department, and offers mountain biking, mountain boarding, and COPE. COPE, short for Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience, comes in two varieties: High COPE, which focuses on individual feats, and Low COPE, which consists of team-based exercises. In 2008, 'Spoke 'n Rope' was re-branded the 'Adventure Sports' Department, splitting into several crews: Endurance Crew (the climbing department), Nautical Crew (the sailing department), Velocity Crew (mountain biking/boarding), and the Challenge Crew. * Arts teaches art- and craft-based merit badges as well as Indian Lore, Fingerprinting, Textiles, Pottery, and Pulp & Paper *Trading Post is the local store that is run by camp staff. It sells everything a Scout could need including candy, food, drinks, shirts, knives and ropes. It is a very popular hangout for Scouts when they are not getting merit badges. * Shooting Sports offers rifle and shotgun shooting merit badges, as well as archery. It is located at the end of the Ho Chi Mischke Trail, the name of which is a portmanteau of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the camp director's name. Added in 2017, Sporting Arrows is a game where kids and adults can shoot discs launched from a trap with arrows. *The Health & Safety department teaches badges like First Aid and Fire Safety.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxlrmeI72MgWvZcm3uFfTgjySPOLCWhryOYq2wUwAmw/edit#gid=2102849983 *The Field Sports department, created in 2016 by Austin Maloney, offers Personal Fitness, Sports, and the Athletics merit badges.

He was most noted for his role in the 1862 Great Locomotive Chase, a daring sabotage mission and raid conducted by soldiers of the Union Army in northern Georgia. Fuller's determined pursuit prevented the Union agents from driving a captured train north to Tennessee and the Union lines. Early life Fuller was born at Morrow Station in rural Henry County, Georgia, to William Alexander Fuller. He was educated in local schools and married quite young. He began working for the Western & Atlantic Railroad on September 8, 1855, at the age of 19. By the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, Fuller served as a conductor on trains running from Atlanta. Great Locomotive Chase On the morning of April 12, 1862, the locomotive General was stopped at Big Shanty (now Kennesaw, Georgia) so that the crew and passengers could have breakfast. While they were dining in the Lacey Hotel, Federal spy James J. Andrews and his party of Union volunteers commandeered the General, its tender, and a few boxcars and steamed northward. An astonished Fuller chased the stolen train by foot and then by handcar. At Etowah, Fuller commandeered another locomotive, the old Yonah, and took it north to Kingston, Georgia, keeping up the pressure on Andrews. The raiders began raising rails and cutting telegraph wires to delay their pursuers, although an attempt to burn a covered bridge failed. At Kingston, Fuller took command of the newer, faster William R. Smith and headed north to Adairsville. The tracks two miles (3 km) south of Adairsville were broken by the raiders and Fuller had to run the two miles by foot. Once at Adairsville, the determined Fuller appropriated the southbound locomotive Texas and again chased the General, although the Texas was in reverse. Concurrently, Andrews' Raiders were cutting the telegraph wires so no transmissions could go through to Chattanooga. With the Texas still chasing the General in reverse, the pair of trains sped through Dalton and Tunnel Hill, to the surprise of local residents and railroad workers. At milepost 116.3 (north of Ringgold), Andrews' Raiders abandoned the General and scattered from the locomotive just a few miles short of their destination of Chattanooga. Andrews and most of his raiders were soon captured and taken to Atlanta for trial. After they were found guilty of espionage and conspiracy, Andrews and several members of his party were executed by hanging. The Georgia State Assembly later noted that, \\"The conduct of Mr. Fuller, the Conductor, and of some others in the hazardous pursuit, while the spies were in possession of the train, deserves the highest commendation and entitles them to the consideration of the General Assembly.\\"Minutes of the Georgia State Assembly for 1862 Following his successful pursuit of Andrews' Raiders, Fuller was commissioned by Governor Joseph E. Brown on August 3, 1863, for a six-month term as a captain in the Independent State Road Guards. His commission was renewed for another term in February 1864. Fuller hired and trained militia to serve as guards on Georgia's railroads to prevent a recurrence of Andrews' Raid. After the War Following the Civil War, Fuller served as the Chief Marshal for the city of Atlanta from September to October 1865. Fuller resigned from the W&ARR; in January 1870 to take a position with the Macon & Western Railroad for two years. His first wife, Lulu (Asher) Fuller, died in 1872. None of their four children had survived infancy. He remarried in 1874 (to Susan C. Alford, who bore him five children). Fuller returned to work for the Western & Atlantic in 1876. In his later years, he became a merchant in Atlanta. Fuller died in Atlanta and was buried in the city's Oakland Cemetery. His striking monument reads: \\"On April 12, 1862, Captain Fuller pursued and after a race of 80 miles from Big Shanty Northward on the Western & Atlantic railroad, re-captured the historic war-engine General which had been seized by 22 Federal soldiers in disguise, thereby preventing the destruction of the bridges of the railroad and the consequent dismemberment of the Confederacy.\\" In 1950, the state of Georgia commissioned a special gold medal in honor of Fuller's work during the Great Locomotive Chase. It was presented to his son, William Alford Fuller, on May 15.

It stars Lee Van Cleef as Chris Adams, succeeding Yul Brynner and George Kennedy in the role. It was directed by George McCowan. Plot In southern Arizona Territory, hired gun-turned-marshal Chris Adams rescues his old friend, former bounty hunter Jim Mackay, from an ambush. Jim asks Chris to help him defend the Mexican border town of Magdalena from De Toro and his bandits, but Chris is reluctant. Chris refuses his new wife Arrila‚Äôs request to release teenager Shelly Donavan, jailed for robbery. Chris meets with newspaper writer Noah Forbes for a story on Chris' eventful career. The next morning, loading prisoners onto the Tucson prison wagon, Chris decides to free Donavan. Chris meets Noah to discuss his exploits, as Donavan celebrates his release with Hank and Bob Allen. Donavan leads the brothers in a bank robbery just as Arrila meets Chris and Noah outside. Wounding Chris, Donavan abducts Arrila and escapes with the Allens. Revived two days later, Chris sets off in search of Arrila, accompanied by Noah. In the desert, Noah and Chris find Arrila dead. Chris tracks down the Allens and demands Donavan's whereabouts. Confident that Chris will take them back to town for trial, Hank reveals that Donavan has fled to Mexico, and admits Arrila was raped and tortured before her murder. Chris shoots Hank, and Bob pleads for his life, insisting he did not join in the assault, but Chris shoots Bob as Noah looks on in shock. Chris rides to the Mexican border and finds Jim with armed farmers from Magdalena, hoping to ambush De Toro. Jim reveals that Donavan rode by the previous day, and Chris again refuses to join, telling Jim he is badly outnumbered and will be slaughtered. Chris and Noah track Donavan through the desert, only to find themselves circling back toward Jim's location. Hearing distant gunfire, they find the farmers dead with no sign of Jim. Chris assumes the women of Magdalena have been left unprotected and Jim will have returned there, and rides into Mexico with the uncertain Noah. At the mission in Magdalena, Chris kills three bandits and find the townswomen, who have been beaten and raped. Laurie Gunn explains that the women were defenseless against De Toro and his more than forty men who arrived the previous day. Although Laurie and the women plead with Chris to help them escape before De Toro's return, he points out there are no horses and a desert trek would kill them. Realizing that the American Cavalry will not cross the border, Chris and Noah ride to Tucson, promising to return. Not far from Magdalena, the pair come upon the bodies of Jim, Donavan, and the remaining farmers. In Tucson, Chris meets with the governor then travels to the prison, asking the warden to pardon the last five prisoners he arrested: Pepe Carrall, Walt Drummond, Scott Elliott, Mark Skinner, and former Confederate captain Andy Hayes. Chris tells the criminals he will sign their pardons if they join his posse, and they grudgingly agree. Loaded with supplies, the group departs for De Toro's hacienda. The men overcome the guards and loot the home, and Chris takes De Toro's woman captive. Riding to Magdalena, Chris warns the men not to escape. Chris designs an elaborate trap for the bandits. The women and construction worker Elliott help prepare several ditches, barbed wire fences, and hidden barriers. After training the women in reloading the weapons, the town awaits De Toro's arrival. The bandits attack, but the town‚Äôs initial assault with long-range guns sends the outlaws into disarray. The defenders retreat to the second line of defense; protected by Elliott's clever fences, they dynamite many of the bandits. Walt, Hayes and Elliott are killed and Noah wounded as the group retreats behind another rigged barricade. At the mission where De Toro's woman and the town children are hiding, Chris tells Laurie his last resort: they will lure the bandits inside and blow up the church. Pepe is killed in De Toro's renewed assault. Hearing the bandits approach, Laurie prepares to dynamite the mission and frees De Toro's woman, who rushes outside into the gunfight and is accidentally shot by De Toro. Momentarily stunned, De Toro is killed by Chris, and the remaining bandits flee. Chris, Noah, and Skinner decide to start new lives in Magdalena. Cast =The Seven= *Lee Van Cleef as U. S.

Mainly restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, it contains around 46 genera and about 950 species. Genera include Banksia, Grevillea, and Macadamia. Description The Grevilleoideae grow as trees, shrubs, or subshrubs. They are highly variable, making a simple, diagnostic identification key for the subfamily essentially impossible to provide. One common and fairly diagnostic characteristic is the occurrence of flowers in pairs that share a common bract. However, a few Grevilleoideae taxa do not have this property, having solitary flowers or inflorescences of unpaired flowers. In most taxa, the flowers occur in densely packed heads or spikes, and the fruit is a follicle. Distribution and habitat Grevilleoideae are mainly a Southern Hemisphere family. The main centre of diversity is Australia, with around 700 of 950 species occurring there, and South America also contains taxa. However, the Grevilleoideae are barely present in Africa; almost all of the Proteaceae taxa there belong to the subfamily Proteoideae. The Brabejum tree of Cape Town is the exception, and the only grevilleoid in Africa. Taxonomy Stenocarpus sinuatus (firewheel tree) Lomatia silaifolia Telopea oreades, the Gippsland waratah Grevillea banksii Banksia sessilis (parrotbush) The framework for classification of the Proteaceae was laid by L.A.S. Johnson and Barbara Briggs in their 1975 monograph \\"On the Proteaceae: the evolution and classification of a southern family\\". Their classification has been refined somewhat over the ensuing three decades, most notably by Peter H. Weston and Nigel Barker in 2006. The Grevilleoideae are now considered one of five subfamilies of the Proteaceae. The placement and circumscription of the Grevilleoideae according to Weston and Barker can be summarised as: Family Proteaceae Juss. :Subfamily Bellendenoideae P.H.Weston(1 genus) :Subfamily Persoonioideae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs(2 tribes, 5 genera) :Subfamily Symphionematoideae P.H.Weston & N.P.Barker(2 genera) :Subfamily Proteoideae Eaton (4 tribes, 5 subtribes, 25 genera) :Subfamily Grevilleoideae Engl. ::incertae sedis ::::Sphalmium ‚Äî Carnarvonia ::Tribe Roupaleae Meisn. :::incertae sedis ::::Megahertzia ‚Äî Knightia ‚Äî Eucarpha ‚Äî Triunia :::Subtribe Roupalinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Roupala ‚Äî Neorites ‚Äî Orites :::Subtribe Lambertiinae (Venk.Rao) L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Lambertia ‚Äî Xylomelum :::Subtribe Heliciinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Helicia ‚Äî Hollandaea :::Subtribe Floydiinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Darlingia ‚Äî Floydia ::Tribe Banksieae Rchb. :::fossil form genera ::::Banksieaeidites ‚Äî Banksieaeformis ‚Äî Banksieaephyllum :::Subtribe Musgraveinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Musgravea ‚Äî Austromuellera :::Subtribe Banksiinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Banksia ::Tribe Embothrieae Rchb. :::Subtribe Lomatiinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Lomatia :::Subtribe Embothriinae Endl. ::::Embothrium ‚Äî Oreocallis ‚Äî Alloxylon ‚Äî Telopea :::Subtribe Stenocarpinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Stenocarpus ‚Äî Strangea :::Subtribe Hakeinae Endl. ::::Opisthiolepis ‚Äî Buckinghamia ‚Äî Hakea ‚Äî Grevillea ‚Äî Finschia ::Tribe Macadamieae Venk.Rao :::Subtribe Macadamiinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Macadamia ‚Äî Panopsis ‚Äî Brabejum :::Subtribe Malagasiinae P.H.Weston & N.P.Barker ::::Malagasia ‚Äî Catalepidia :::Subtribe Virotiinae P.H.Weston & N.P.Barker ::::Virotia ‚Äî Athertonia ‚Äî Heliciopsis :::Subtribe Gevuininae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Cardwellia ‚Äî Sleumerodendron ‚Äî Euplassa ‚Äî Gevuina ‚Äî Bleasdalea ‚Äî Hicksbeachia ‚Äî Kermadecia ‚Äî Turrillia The tribes of Grevilleoideae given by Weston and Barker are shown below: Uses Edible nuts of Macadamia The nursery industry cultivates many Grevilleoideae species as barrier plants and for their prominent and distinctive flowers and foliage.

The intention was to ensure uniformity and legibility in the handwritten cards of library catalogs. Beginning in September 1885, Melvil Dewey and Thomas Edison developed and perfected the approved library hand to be taught in library school and used in libraries. The penmanship was based on Edison's own handwriting in which he stated that \\"I had perfected a style of handwriting which would allow me to take legibly from the wire, long hand, forty-seven and even fifty-four words a minute\\". The 1903 Handbook of the New York State Library School listed the requirements of library hand. They included legibility, speed, and uniformity. The particular type of ink, inkstands, pens, penholders, and erasers was specified.

Character overview His father Vern Schillinger is an inmate who runs the Aryan Brotherhood within Oz. An amoral drug addict, Hank, like his younger brother Andrew, has been raised on white supremacist ideology by his father and grandfather. Hank was involved in several drug related issues on the outside and even sells out his girlfriend to black pimp Curtis Bennett as a means of paying back a debt. At the request of Tobias Beecher, Hank visits with Vern, who uses him in a revenge scheme to kidnap Beecher's children. The kidnapping results in the death of Beecher's son Gary and prompts Beecher to hire the Italian inmates to exact revenge on Hank. As a result, Hank is killed in Massachusetts by an Italian hitman named Gaetano Cincetta. Season 4 Part I Looking to resolve his guilt for helping cause the death of Andrew Schillinger, Beecher enlists a private investigator to find Hank and reunite him with his father Vern. After Hank is found, Tobias arranges for him to be paid to visit Vern as Hank will only see him if he gets enough money to buy more drugs. Vern is overjoyed to see Hank until he finds out that the visit was arranged by Beecher. Remembering what happened to Andrew, Vern thinks it is another plot by Beecher to turn his last son against him. To prevent this from happening, Vern plots to kidnap Beecher's two children, Gary and Holly. Vern pays Hank to kidnap the two, and then pays him more money to sever Gary's hand and ship it to Oz. To find his children, Beecher enlists FBI Agent Pierce Taylor to investigate the kidnapping; Taylor suspects Chris Keller instead of Vern Schillinger. Beecher is distraught when his son's hand is shipped to Oz and even more distraught after Hank kills Gary. At the urging of Father Mukada, Vern learns that Beecher had no evil intent with Hank and calls off the kidnapping. As Hank releases Holly, the FBI arrests him on the spot. Vern is then concerned that Hank may give him up under interrogation but Hank is then freed on a legal technicality. Infuriated, Beecher goes to Italian inmate Chucky Pancamo and hires him to kill Hank. Hank is killed in Massachusetts by an Italian hitman and his body remains missing for more than six months.

Anti-personnel mines may be classified into blast mines or fragmentation mines, the latter may or may not be a bouncing mine. The mines are often designed to injure, not kill, their victims in order to increase the logistical (mostly medical) support required by enemy forces that encounter them. Some types of anti-personnel mines can also damage the tracks on armoured vehicles or the tires of wheeled vehicles. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has sought to ban mines culminating in the 1997 Ottawa Treaty, although this treaty has not yet been accepted by a number of countries including the United States, Israel, Russia, the People's Republic of China, Pakistan and India.  Use  Italian Valmara 69 bouncing type anti- personnel mine Anti-personnel mines are used in a similar manner to anti-tank mines, in static \\"mine fields\\" along national borders or in defense of strategic positions as described in greater detail in the land mine article. What makes them different from most anti-tank mines, however, is their smaller size, which enables large numbers to be simultaneously deployed over a large area. This process can be done manually, via dispensers on land vehicles, or from helicopters or aircraft. Alternatively, they can be dispensed by cargo- carrying artillery shells. Other uses specific to anti-personnel mines are where they are deployed on an ad hoc basis in the following situations: *When laying an ambush *Protecting a temporary base *To force any attackers to travel through a narrow, cleared path where firepower can be focused on the enemy *To evade pursuit (e.g. M86 Pursuit Deterrent Munition) *To protect equipment by employing the mines as booby traps *To booby trap other mines as a form of anti-handling device  Blast mines  Anti personnel mine in Cambodia Typically, anti-personnel blast mines are triggered when the victim steps on them. Their primary purpose is to blow the victim's foot or leg off, disabling them. Injuring, rather than killing, the victim is viewed as preferable in order to increase the logistical (evacuation, medical) burden on the opposing force. = Effect = When a person steps on a blast mine and activates it, the mine's main charge detonates, creating a blast shock wave consisting of hot gases travelling at extremely high velocity. The shock wave sends a huge compressive force upwards, ejecting the mine casing and any soil covering the mine along with it. When the blast wave hits the surface, it quickly transfers the force into the subject's footwear and foot. This results in a massive compression force being applied. In most cases, the victim's foot is blown off by the blast wave. The resulting injuries to a human body depend on the size of the mine's main charge, the depth, type of soil it was laid in and how the victim contacted it, e.g. stepping on the mine, using all or part of the foot. Different types of soil will result in different amounts of energy being transferred upward into the subject's foot, with saturated \\"clay- like\\" soil transferring the most. Larger main charges result in a release of significantly more energy, driving the blast wave further up a target's foot and leg and causing greater injury, in some cases even described as severe as traumatic amputation of the leg up to the knee. Secondary injuries from a blast mine are often caused by the material that has been torn loose by the mine's explosion. This consists of the soil and stones that were on top of the mine, parts of the victim's footwear and the small bones in the victim's foot. This debris creates wounds typical of similar secondary blast effects or fragmentation. Special footwear, including combat boots or so-called \\"blast boots\\", is only moderately protective against the destructive effects of blast mines, and the loss of a foot is a typical outcome. Blast mines have little effect on armoured vehicles, but can damage a wheeled vehicle if it runs directly over the mine. Small blast mines will severely damage a tire, rendering it irreparable while some types could also damage adjacent running gear. = Components = Typical components of an anti-personnel blast mine  Mine casing  The mine casing houses the components of the mine and protects it from its environment. Early mines, such as the ones used in the World War II era, had casings made of steel or aluminium. However, by the middle of the conflict, the British Army was using the first, practical, portable metal detector‚Äîthe Polish mine detector. The Germans responded with mines that had a wooden or glass casing to make detection harder. Wooden mines had been used by the Russians in 1939, before the appearance of metal detectors, in order to save steel. Some, like the PP Mi-D mine, continued to be used into the 1980s as they were easy to make and hard to detect. Wood has the disadvantage of rotting and splitting, rendering the mine non-functional after a comparatively short time in the ground (or the advantage, in that the mine can be considered self-disabling, and will be less likely to cause unintended injuries years later). Mines manufactured after the 1950s generally use plastic casings to hinder detection by electronic mine detectors. Some, referred to as minimum metal mines, are constructed with as little metal as possible ‚Äì often around ‚Äì to make them difficult to detect. Mines containing absolutely no metal have been produced, but are uncommon. By its nature, a mine without any metal components in it cannot be found using a metal detector.  Pressure plate/fuze mechanism  The fuze mechanism is designed to set off the detonator, either by striking it with a spring-loaded firing pin, compressing a friction sensitive pyrotechnic composition, or by passing an electric charge through it. Most mines employ a spring-loaded striker that hits a stab detonator when activated by the victim. Typically, the detonator contains a tiny pellet of lead azide. The fuze is the most complicated component in any mine, although the amount of effort required to design and manufacture a simple fuze mechanism is quite low, similar to the retraction mechanism in a ballpoint pen. More sophisticated examples, such as the Italian SB-33 mine have a fuze mechanism that detonates the mine if subject to gradual, steady pressure, but locks the fuze if subject to a sudden shock. This defeats one of the main methods of clearing a path through a minefield ‚Äî detonating the mines with explosive devices, such as mine-clearing line charges.  Booster  The booster charge is a highly sensitive explosive that will activate easily when subjected to the shock of the detonator. Typically, a pea-sized pellet of RDX is used. The purpose of the booster is to amplify the shock of the detonator and initiate the main explosive charge.  Main charge  The main charge consists of a stable explosive that is detonated by the booster charge. This is necessary, because making a mine out of a highly sensitive detonator or booster explosive would be more expensive, and make the device more sensitive and thereby susceptible to accidental detonation. In most AP blast mines TNT, Composition B or phlegmatized RDX are used. On a US M14 mine, 29 grams of tetryl is used, while 240 grams of TNT is used in a Russian PMN mine. = Deployment = Anti- personnel blast mines are the most common type and are typically deployed on the surface (hidden by leaves or rocks) or buried under soil at a depth of 10 ‚Äì 20 mm. They are activated by pressure, i.e. when the victim steps on them, but it could also be a vehicle driving over them. They were designed for use as area denial weapons. Weapons of this type are supposed to deny opposing military forces access to a specific area.  Fragmentation mines  Stockmine M43 in a display case surrounded by other less lethal items While blast mines are designed to cause severe injury to one person, fragmentation mines (such as the World War II era German S-mine) are designed to project fragments across a wide area, causing fragmentation wounds to nearby personnel.\\"How Axis Mines Work\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1944, p. 131 Fragmentation mines are generally much larger and heavier than blast mines, and contain a large amount (often several kilograms) of ferrous metal. As such, they are easy to detect if the environment is not too heavily contaminated with iron. = Effect = These mines are deemed to be more efficient than purely \\"blast effect\\" mines, because the shrapnel covers a greater area, potentially injuring more combatants. The shrapnel from these mines can even disable some armoured vehicles, by puncturing their tires and‚Äîin the case of soft-skinned vehicles‚Äîalso penetrating the skin and damaging internal components or injuring personnel. Because fragmentation mines generally contain a much larger charge than blast mines, they can cause severe damage to an unarmoured vehicle which runs directly over one. = Types of fragmentation mine =  Stake  These mines (such as the Russian POMZ) are entirely above ground, having a fragmenting warhead mounted on a stake at a suitable height, concealed by vegetation or rubbish and triggered by one or more tripwires.  Bounding  Bounding mines have a small lifting charge that, when activated, launches the main body of the mine out of the ground before it detonates at around chest height. This produces a more lethal spray of shrapnel over a larger area. One such‚Äîthe US M16 mine‚Äîcan cause injuries up to away. The steel shrapnel makes bounding mines easy to detect, so they may be surrounded by minimum metal mines to make mine clearance harder.  Directional  Directional fragmentation weapons (such as the M18 Claymore) differ from other types in that they are designed to direct their fragments only in a limited arc. They are placed so that the blast will be directed at the target area and away from friendly forces. This design also allows forces to protect themselves by placing these types of mines near their own positions, but facing the enemy. They are triggered in a conventional manner with either tripwire or command detonation. They are generally referred to as claymore mines from the US mine of this type.

These injuries were recently reported in BMJ Open to be far worse than landmines, resulting in multiple limb amputations and lower body mutilation. This combination of injuries has been given the name \\"Dismounted Complex Blast Injury\\" and is thought to be the worst survivable injury ever seen in war.  Other mine types  During World War II, flame mines known as the flame fougasse were produced by the British during the invasion crisis of 1940. Later, the Russians produced a flame-mine, called the FOG-1. This was copied by the Germans to produce the Abwehrflammenwerfer 42, these devices were effectively disposable, trip-wire triggered flamethrowers. Chemical mines have also been made. They were made by Britain, the US and the Soviet Union during World War II, but never deployed. During the Cold War, the US produced the M23 chemical mine containing VX (nerve agent). A small explosive charge burst the mine open and dispersed the chemical when the mine was triggered.  Examples  ;World War II anti-personnel mines *S-mine (Bouncing Betty): infamous German bouncing mine; widely copied after the war. *Glasmine 43: German mine made largely from glass, to make it difficult to detect. *PDM-6 and PMD-7: Russian World War II mines, made from wood. ;Post-War, US anti- personnel mines *Gravel mines, 1960s‚Äì1970s.

Criticism of name  The author Rob Nixon has criticized the use of the adjective \\"anti-personnel\\" to describe mines, noting that the word \\"personnel\\" signifies people engaged in a particular organization, whereas in reality \\"four-fifths of mine casualties are civilians\\", in particular children. Thus, he argues, the name \\"flatters their accuracy by implying that they target an organization, military or otherwise.\\"  See also  *Anti-tank mine *Blast resistant mine *Anti-handling device *Bouncing mine *Demining *Fougasse (weapon) *Handicap International *Mine clearance agencies *Mines Advisory Group *Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction also known as the Ottawa Treaty  References   External links  *\\"Antipersonnel Mines\\" Popular Science, February 1945, p. 71, article for US public about the German Mustard Pot Mine and the Sch-Mine. *Mines Advisory Group *Typical antipersonnel mine injuries.

It was located on the north side of the River Thames near Island Gardens in the east of the city, and is not to be confused with the present-day North Greenwich station on the London Underground's Jubilee line, which is located on the south side of the river, one mile downstream on the Greenwich Peninsula. History Map of North Greenwich station, 1890s North Greenwich was the terminus of the Millwall Extension Railway (MER) branch of the London and Blackwall Railway, down-line from the western terminus at , although services did not operate through to Fenchurch Street but instead connected to the Fenchurch Street-Blackwall service at . was the preceding station along the line. Opened in July 1872 (slightly later than the other stations on the branch) with the official name North Greenwich & Cubitt Town, it connected with a ferry service to Greenwich south of the river. The ferry was later replaced by the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. Traffic at the station was always light and, as with the rest of the MER, it closed to passengers in May 1926, though goods transport continued until the demise of the docks in the 1970s. The area was heavily redeveloped following the Docklands developments of the 1980s, and most of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) between Island Gardens and South Quay utilises the old MER route. The original Island Gardens DLR station (at that time the DLR's southern terminus) was built on the north end of the original North Greenwich station site when the DLR opened in 1987. When the DLR was extended to Lewisham in the 1990s, a new Island Gardens DLR station was built on the opposite side of Manchester Road, and the former site was demolished and replaced by a block of flats.

Located east of Rockville, in the eastern part of Montgomery County, it is situated on Rock Creek. The lake was created by damming Rock Creek in 1965 with the goal of providing flood control and reducing soil erosion.\\"Park's Staff to Run Boat Concession At Maryland's New Lake Needwood\\". The Washington Post. October 6, 1966. p. C16.\\"New Montgomery Dam Creates 72-Acre Lake\\". The Washington Post. October 21, 1966. p. B1. Lake Needwood also protects the water quality of the creek by functioning as a retention basin to trap sediment from storm-water runoff. The lake is part of Rock Creek Regional Park. Visitors can rent pedal boats, rowboats, and canoes, and a flat-bottom pontoon boat, the Needwood Queen, is available for rides. Also, the picnic areas surrounding the lake are popular locations for various events. Other park features include a visitors center and snack bar, hiking and biking trails, playgrounds, an archery range and Needwood Golf Course. About one mile (1.6 km) southeast is Lake Needwood's sister lake, Lake Frank. The Rock Creek Trail begins at Lake Needwood and can be followed along the course of Rock Creek, ending at the Potomac River in Washington, D.C.  Lake Needwood Dam  Lake Needwood is a Rock Creek impoundment formed by an earthen embankment, the Lake Needwood Dam. It is made of a high earthen dam built on a fractured rock foundation formed at the junction of the Boulder Gneiss and Upper Pelitic Schist geological formations. In addition to the Lake Needwood's principle spillway outlet, it has a wide emergency spillway originating between the Westside and the Rock Creek Trails. The dam was designed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. At the time of construction, only the right portion of the dam bottom was treated with grout, likely predisposing the structure to generate a concentrated seepage of water from the left abutment during the 2006 Mid-Atlantic United States Flood. The construction of the Lake Needwood Dam was complete in 1965. The dam is owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. In 2007‚Äì2008, the earthen dam underwent a $3 million repair project to install a grout curtain below the Lake Needwood Dam to decrease seepage through its rock foundation and to upgrade the outlet control tower.  Habitat  Lake waters are inhabited by largemouth bass, catfish, bluegill, crappie, and trout. With a license, fishing is permitted. Lake Needwood serves as a temporary stop for many North American migratory birds. However, the shoreline vegetation and soil integrity have been affected by non-migratory Canada geese prompting efforts to control their population. Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006 Crews shoring up the Needwood Dam thumb There have been several evacuations of downstream residents during periods of heavy rain, due to concerns about the structural integrity of the earthen dam constructed in 1965. The latest evacuation, of approximately 2,400 people, was on June 28, 2006.Aller, Hal Van. \\"Dodging the Bullet: Lessons Learned From Recent Dam Emergencies\\". Maryland Department of the Environment. Communities just south of the lake were evacuated and were housed in temporary shelters at nearby high schools until the lake's level dropped. The evacuees lived in 500 apartments at the Rock Creek Terrace complex on Veirs Mill Road in Rockville and in 700 single family homes in that area. Officials stated that the lake was above its normal level during the flood, and many roads in the surrounding area had been closed down for fear of flooding. As the flood subsided, evacuees returned home on June 29, 2006. Montgomery County Homeland Security director Gordon Aoyagi and County Chief Administrative Officer Bruce Romer estimated that if the dam had broken, areas south of the lake could have flooded up to .\\"Rain Sets Records, Causes Huge Problems\\".

Dredging was then deferred for budgetary reasons. In 2008, the County started preparations to dredge sediment from the lake during 2010-2011. The dredging project aimed to improve water quality, as well as boating and fishing conditions.Gazette Newspapers.\\"Lake Needwood to be lowered.\\" February 13, 2008. In October 2010, the water level was lowered by about six feet to allow more time for the sediment to dry out for dredging. The shallower north end of the lake was deepened from 1‚Äì4 feet deep to 12‚Äì18 feet deep. The lake was reopened in summer 2012. Water quality In 2010, lake waters tested positive for microcystin, a toxin produced by cyanobacteria that can cause liver damage. The toxin was also reported in the water in 2012‚Äì2017 and in 2020. Approximately 50 bright yellow signs are posted along trails around the lake advising patrons to keep pets away from the water. Cyanobacteria develop in the lake due to an overabundance of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in the water. In residential areas, the nutrients are generated by excessive fertilizer use and associated urban runoff, which cause harmful algal blooms (HABs) in water bodies. Higher water temperature and low circulation are contributing factors.

It began as a Native American path called the Minsi Trail which developed into a colonial highway called the King's Road in the 1760s. Most of the route later became part of U.S. Route 309, now Pennsylvania Route 309.  History  = Colonial Age = The Bethlehem Pike originated from a Native American pathway known as the Minsi Trail. Named after the Minsi Indians, the trail was routed between the Blue Mountains and the lands to the south. In December 1740, David Nitschmann and his party went to Bethlehem and Nazareth along this trail. A year later, a second party joined the first, traversing the same pathway. Nicolaus Zinzendorf, was included in the second party who visited the pioneers in the cabin along the banks of the Monocacy Creek. On Christmas Eve, Zinzendorf celebrated a famous love-feast service, during which the new settlement was named Bethlehem. After the founding of Bethlehem, a number of settlements began to rise along the route, causing a constant use of it and the highway to be called King's Road. The first trip made by George Klein was by stage wagon on September 10, 1763. He later made regular trips between Philadelphia and Bethlehem on a weekly basis. He started on Mondays from the Sun Inn in Bethlehem, and returned from the King of Prussia Inn in Philadelphia, on Thursdays. Bethlehem Pike and Germantown Avenue were the first two segments of the King's Highway, the main road carrying passengers and their goods between Philadelphia and the north. In the northern regions of Philadelphia, the pike intersected the Old York Road. According to a legend, Tamanend, the great Indian chief, presented all lands within the young Germans' vision. Following the gift they received from the natives, they concluded the ritual, the sun rose, and the men named the spot Rising Sun. During the American Revolutionary War, British officers gathered near the southern terminus of the modern day pike. They gathered in the days their army faced the Continental Army at Whitemarsh. Further north along the route in the Whitemarsh Valley is the site where George Washington held Howe at bay, thus becoming famous in history as Church Hill. Before heading to Valley Forge, Washington and his army encamped here on December 11, 1777. During the revolution, the pike dealt with a busy time period, for Bethlehem was crowded with officers, prisoners, and soldiers from the war. There was great excitement in Bethlehem on September 13, 1777, when the Patriot Army retreated from Philadelphia. Later, a letter had arrived by express courier from David Rittenhouse, announcing that all the military stores, in 700 wagons, were sent north on the Bethlehem Pike. Even the church and state bells were sent over for safekeeping on the pike. In Quakertown, the wagon carrying the Liberty Bell broke down. The bells had to be unloaded on September 25, 1777. Eventually the wagon was repaired and they were sent to Allentown, where it was hidden from danger on Hamilton Street. The road traverses Rockhill Township, where the New Jersey and Pennsylvania armies listened to Richard Peters in 1799, a member of the Colonial assembly. They camped at Seller's Tavern, today known as Sellersville. = Bethlehem Turnpike = In 1804, the route became a toll road known as the Bethlehem Turnpike. Tolls were voluntary only during morning hours. On March 11, 1834, Pennsylvania governor George Wolf signed a license authorizing the Bethlehem Turnpike Road Company to erect many of its gates. The turnpike was authorized to collect tolls from travelers on horses, cattle, and carriages. In 1904, the Bethlehem Pike became a free road after it was tolled for 100 years. The tolls were removed in 1910. When Pennsylvania signed the Sproul Road Bill on May 31, 1911, the state began taking over the highways across the commonwealth. The bill defined the Bethlehem Pike as Legislative Route 297 (LR 297) in Northampton County and LR 153 in Lehigh County. The pike was defined as LR 153 through the counties of Bucks and Montgomery. = Age of numbered roads = In 1926, when the U.S. Numbered Highway System was established, each designated trail in the United States was given a number and the majority of the Bethlehem Pike was signed as U.S. Route 309 (US 309). During a three-decade period after the system was created, the pike was designated as Pennsylvania Route 12 (PA 12) from Bethlehem to Center Valley. South of Center Valley, the route was known as US 309. By 1960, a portion of the road was designated as Pennsylvania Route 191, when it replaced the entire routing of PA 12. North of Philadelphia, US 309 was designated on the newly built Fort Washington Expressway, east of the original alignment on the Bethlehem Pike. By 1970, US 309 was deleted and replaced by Pennsylvania Route 309. Following the commission of the route, PA 309 was moved to a newly constructed freeway, bypassing Sellersville, and west of the Bethlehem Pike. Six years later, Interstate 378 was deleted and PA 191 was truncated, thus designating their former alignments as Pennsylvania Route 378.  Today  PA 309 (Bethlehem Pike) north of US 202 Bus./PA 463 in Montgomery Township. The modern Bethlehem Pike is mostly designated as Pennsylvania Route 309 in the Lehigh and Delaware Valleys. In Philadelphia, the road is signed as SR 4017, with a daily traffic of 15,000 vehicles. The pike is routed as SR 2018 in Montgomery County, while parallel to PA 309. North of Fort Washington, the road is known as PA 309, with an average of 17,000 to 21,000 vehicles a day. In Sellersville, the pike is signed as SR 4013, south of PA 152, and SR 4085 north of PA 152. From Quakertown to Center Valley, the pike has an old alignment west of the current designation on PA 309. In the Quakertown area, the PA 309 segment of the pike averages a daily traffic of 18,000 vehicles. North of Center Valley, the road is aligned as PA 378, Old Bethlehem Pike, and Old Philadelphia Pike, with an average traffic of 17,000 vehicles a day on PA 378. The northernmost segment of the pike is known as Main Street in Bethlehem. Lower Gwynedd formed a project to improve the Bethlehem Pike within the township and estimated to cost $500,000.

It was the first Cuban film to be awarded the ‚ÄòGrand Prix √âcrans Juniors‚Äô for children's cinema at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.A Film Whose Shining Stars Are Children, L'Humanit√©, October 13, 2006 In Viva Cuba, a road movie fairy tale,Viva Cuba San Francisco International Film Festival. Cremata tackles localized Cuban problems from the literal point of view of the country's children. He lowers the camera to the eye level of the film's protagonists, Mal√∫ (Mal√∫ Tarrau Broche) and Jorgito (Jorgito Mil√≥ √Åvila). Background Viva Cuba is a Cuban independent film that explores emigration and the effects it can have on children who have to leave friends and extended families behind. Youngsters are often uprooted without being consulted and then must contend with their new surroundings. In one scene, Mal√∫ and Jorgito discuss when they might reunite. The best they can hope for is to forget one another as their lives change and they face new pleasures and challenges. The viewer knows they are unlikely to ever see each other again, unless Mal√∫'s mother can be granted re-entry, which is extremely unlikely given the state of Cuban immigration laws.  Plot  Viva Cuba takes place in Cuba and the two main characters are Mal√∫, who comes from a middle-class family and is raised by her single mother, and Jorgito, whose mother is a poor socialist and his father an alcoholic. The film uses the two children from two different backgrounds to show how these children symbolize the people of Cuba and whether or not they can predict the outcomes of the future. What neither woman recognizes is the immense strength of the bond between Mal√∫ and Jorgito. Following the death of Mal√∫'s grandmother, the children find out that Mal√∫'s mother is planning to leave Cuba to go to another country, where she has a boyfriend, Jorgito suggests they run away and travel to the other side of the island to find Mal√∫'s father and persuade him against signing the forms that would allow Mal√∫ and her mother to leave the country, followed by him saying that if they were to hug strongly, they would be inseparable, even if Mal√∫ were to leave Cuba. Both children are seen preparing for the journey as their social statuses are greatly contrasted. Mal√∫'s clean clothes and her plastic drinking cup at breakfast and her toys are compared to Jorgito's uncleaned clothes and the use of a metal cup for breakfast. The two children embark on their journey, avoiding the police sent to search for the two of them. The disappearance of both children bring their mothers closer together in their grief. Jorgito loses the map he brought with him and tensions rise between the two children. Not to mention, Mal√∫ sang on stage at a festival that was broadcast over the air. The kids' parents saw Mal√∫ on TV and had the implication that Mal√∫ and Jorgito were, in fact, traveling towards the lighthouse. Jorgito then becomes infuriated with Mal√∫. They insult each other; Mal√∫ brings up Jorgito's social status, and Jorgito calls Mal√∫'s mother a slut. However, they were stuck with each other for the rest of the journey. One day, Mal√∫ gets hungry, and the two kids find a tent containing tons of food and goods, although they don't know who it belongs to. The kids fight over who gets to eat what food until the owner of the tent arrives asking why they were trespassing. Mal√∫ explains their story, while she and Jorgito also try to explain that they didn't want to be friends anymore. The owner of the tent tells them that true friends always stay friends, even if they fight, causing Mal√∫ and Jorgito's bond to reform. When they reach the lighthouse where Mal√∫'s father works, the forms had already been signed before she could persuade him otherwise. The parents (minus Mal√∫'s father), having reached the lighthouse before the kids got there, begin to beat their children and argue among each other. The two children run away from the fight and console each other by the shore; a silent goodbye.  Analysis  Taking place in Cuba, Mal√∫ is from a middle-class family and her single mother does not want her to play with Jorgito, as she thinks his background is coarse and common-place. Jorgito's mother, a poor socialist proud of her family's social standing, places similar restrictions on her son. What neither women recognize is the immense strength of the bond between Mal√∫ and Jorgito. Following the death of Mal√∫'s grandmother, the children find out that Mal√∫'s mother is planning to leave Cuba to go to another country, where she has a boyfriend, Jorgito suggests they run away and travel to the other side of the island to find Mal√∫'s father and persuade him against signing the forms that would allow Mal√∫ and her mother to leave the country, followed by him saying that if they were to hug strongly, they would be inseparable, even if Mal√∫ were to leave Cuba.

They insult each other; Mal√∫ brings up Jorgito's social status, and Jorgito calls Mal√∫'s mother a slut. However, they were stuck with each other for the rest of the journey. One day, Mal√∫ gets hungry, and the two kids find a tent containing tons of food and goods, although they don't know who it belongs to. The kids fight over who gets to eat what food until the owner of the tent arrives asking why they were trespassing. Mal√∫ explains their story, while she and Jorgito also try to explain that they didn't want to be friends anymore. The owner of the tent tells them that true friends always stay friends, even if they fight, causing Mal√∫ and Jorgito's bond to reform. When they reach the lighthouse where Mal√∫'s father works, the forms had already been signed before she could persuade him otherwise. The parents (minus Mal√∫'s father), having reached the lighthouse before the kids got there, begin to beat their children and argue among each other. The two children run away from the fight and console each other by the shore; a silent goodbye. Mal√∫ and Jorgito head down a cliff where they are in front of wide ocean as they strongly hug, proving Jorgito's words of their friendship being eternal. It is implied that the two children jump off of the cliff, committing suicide, although this is not shown in the movie. It is also arguable that the children have been fantasizing the entire time and the final scene does not actually indicate their corporeal deaths, but the death of their cherished friendship. The films starts out with a few smaller boys who are playing with fake guns. Later on Mal√∫ states that she wants to be the queen of Spain, the children are pretending that they are in the Spanish War, Cuba against Spain. Since the children are playing this as a game, it is interpreted that they do not fully understand the meaning of war and why they exist or what the outcomes are after a war. During the film the parents express how they do not know what Cuba will have for them in the future. When Mal√∫'s grandmother dies, Mal√∫ overhears her mother on the phone talking to her future husband about leaving Cuba because now that her mother has died there is nothing left for them there. Mal√∫ does not want to leave so her and Jorgito take matters into their own hands. As many of the people in Cuba did for their own reasons. Already the film is showing how the children have no say in anything their parents are planning to do, as the people in Cuba have no say in what the future of Cuba holds for them. For the children it is hard when a parent tells them they are going to leave their home, but for some people in Cuba during this time they felt like they had to leave to stay safe. For Mal√∫ she had just lost her grandmother and now her mother was telling her that she was going to have to leave all of her friends too. The children do not exactly understand why they cannot change her mother's mind so they go in search of her father. For the people of Cuba they cannot understand how someone can dictate them the way that they are being treated. When the children finally reach Mal√∫'s father he has already signed the papers and Mal√∫ is devastated. She cries and says how could he sign the papers when no one asked her if she even wanted to leave. All of these actions represent the past and the present of what is happening in Cuba. Mal√∫ and Jorgito's hope is a representation of how the people of Cuba hope their futures will be. It is easily compared to how the two feel about Mal√∫ having to leave. Both of the children are hopeful that they can get her father to not sign the papers, just as the people of Cuba are hopeful that Cuba will become a better place. The children are on a journey to get Mal√∫'s dad to fix the situation, just as the people of Cuba are hopeful and looking for other people to fix the situations that they are currently in. Mal√∫ and Jorgito are fighting for something, that is in comparison to, what the people of Cuba are fighting for.  Conclusion  After this tough and long journey the children realize at the end that they cannot stop what is going to happen, just the same that the people of Cuba can fight for a change and it probably will not happen. The children then run off and stand on top of a cliff, they hug, and the water storms on top of them. It can be implied that they jumped off because they were unhappy with the outcome. This symbolizing that the people of Cuba during this time were also still unhappy with the way things were going and that they cannot change them. Another implied ending is that after the children hug they jump off the cliff and commit suicide. The end of the film is unknown to what exactly happened whether the children lived or died, just as the future of Cuba during that time was unknown as to whether things would become better or worse. The children symbolize how people of Cuba were reacting during that time. They were unaware of what exactly from the past will impact their future and just how drastic those changes will be towards the future of Cuba.  Reception  The film became a box office hit and went on to win many awards nationally and internationally as it was displayed at many film festivals around the world, including 2005 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix Ecrans Juniors Award,Viva Cuba 7th Annual Havana Film Festival in New York City, 2006. plus awards in countries as diverse as Australia, Italy, Guatemala, Germany, France, and Taiwan.Havana Journal Interview January 30, 2006 In 2008, it was shown all over Venezuela.Viva Cuba to Be Played in All Venezuelan Theaters www.cubanews.ain.cu.

It belongs to the third generation of Soviet programmable calculators. Its original selling price was 115 rubles. The functionality of the MK-52 is identical to that of the Elektronika MK-61, except that the MK-52 has an internal non-volatile EEPROM memory module for permanent data storage, a diagnostic slot, and a slot for ROM modules. The programming language and functionality of the MK-52 and MK-61 calculators were extensions of the earlier MK-54, B3-34, and B3-21 Elektronika calculators. The MK-52 is the only calculator known to have internal storage in the form of an EEPROM module. As with many Soviet calculators, the MK-52 has a number of undocumented functions. In November 1988, the MK-52 went into space on the Soyuz TM-7 spacecraft, where it could have been used to calculate the trajectory of landing in the event of an onboard computer failure.  Architecture  The MK-52 has 105 steps of volatile program memory, an internal EEPROM module (with 512 bytes of memory), and 15 7-byte registers. It uses four AA-size battery cells or can be plugged into a power adapter. It has a relatively dim, ten-digit (8 digit mantissa, 2 digit exponent) green vacuum fluorescent display. The MK-52 has an expansion port to which various ROM (Read-only memory) modules could be attached. Its system clock speed is approximately 75 kHz (derived from a phases generator chip), and it weighs approximately 400 grammes. The MK-52 is the first Soviet micro-calculator with non-volatile electrically erasable memory (EEPROM, type KR1601RP1, with a capacity of 4 kilobits, and capable of 10,000 rewrites), ensuring security for programs, and for the clipboard, when the power is turned off. This EEPROM memory is capable of storing up to 512 1-byte program words (or the contents of 72 7-byte registers) and exchanging its contents with the calculator's RAM. The calculator is fully compatible with the second-generation models (B3-34 and MK-54), using the same command system and machine codes. On average, a program that takes all 105 steps of program memory and 15 registers on the MC-52 will be equivalent in capability to approximately 140-150 steps and 18 registers on the B3-34. Additionally, the MC-52 has an extended set of commands that can allocate integer and fractional parts of numbers, search for absolute and maximum values of numbers, and perform certain logical operations. = Electric current requirements = In standby mode (when the screen is illuminated zero) - about 89 mA, In memory mode (execution of the program \`Cx‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë:–í–ü –ö\`, resulting in the indicator showing only the luminous decimal point) - about 84 mA, In counting mode, in accordance with the program - 73 mA. = ROM = In addition, you can connect an external ROM which is a memory expansion unit with stored games and mathematical programs, produced by the manufacturer, that constitute the user library. Manufacturers have produced 4 types of ROM cartridges, three of them containing various mathematical functions, and one, the BRP-4, containing game programs: BRP-2 \\"Astro\\" (Russian: –ë–†–ü-2 \\"–ê—Å—Ç—Ä–æ\\"), with a set of programs for navigational tasks, information about which was published in issue 12, of 1988, of the Russian- language monthly magazine –ú–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–º —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫–µ (Marine Digest); BRP-3 (Russian: –ë–†–ü-3), containing 60 programs for solving mathematical problems. In 1988, 15,200 units of this ROM were manufactured, and were sold at a price of 16 rubles; BRP-4 (Russian: –ë–†–ü-4) was produced in 1989, containing game programs; GRP \\"Geo\\". There is another expansion jack in the MK-52, which serves to run diagnostics on the calculator during its production, and which could connect the calculator to external devices and their controllers, such as an external printer.  Basic operations  The MK-52 has two main modes of operation: automatic mode and programming mode. General calculations and operations are performed in automatic mode, while programs are fed as input in programming mode. The keystroke sequence \`[F]\` \`[CHS]\` (\`[/-/]\` in appearance) switches the MK-52 to automatic mode, while \`[F]\` \`[EE]\` (\`[Bn]\`) switches it to programming mode. Manual calculations in automatic mode are in accordance with Reverse Polish Notation logic. For example, to evaluate 2+3, the following keystrokes are required: \`[2]\` \`[enter]\` (looks like \`[B^]\`) \`[3]\` \`[+]\`. = Bitwise binary operations = The MK-52 is fully capable of performing Boolean operations on binary numbers. The following example demonstrates the OR logical operation on the binary numbers \`111000\` and \`100001\`: Binary numbers are input into the calculator as hexadecimal numbers prepended by an \`8\`. First, the operator must divide the numbers into groups of four digits, adding leading zeros if necessary, e.g. splitting \`111000\` into groups of four gives \`0011\` and \`1000\`. The equivalent hexadecimal values of these two four-digit binary numbers are \`3\` and \`8\`, respectively, which equal hexadecimal \`38\`. Similarly, \`100001\` is equivalent to hexadecimal \`21\`. So, the numbers \`8.38\` and \`8.21\` are entered into the MK-52 and the OR operation is performed on them. The OR operation is achieved by pressing the \`[K]\` key, then \`[CHS]\` (which looks like \`[/-/]\`). The result displayed should be \`8.39\`, which translates into binary \`0011\` and \`1001\`, and, hence, the binary number \`111001\`, which is the result. The following list details the MK-52's graphical representation of hexadecimal numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, -, L, C, –ì, E, (blank). Normal hexadecimal representation is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.  Programming  The MK-52's programming commands are typed into the MK-52 in programming mode and are then executed. The MK-52 is fully capable of being programmed to manage memory and to use both conditional and unconditional branching. In programming mode, the screen displays information about the program in memory, represented by two hexadecimal-digit operation codes. For example, if \`10 01 0E 03\` is displayed, then this means that \`0E\` is stored at program step 00, \`01\` is stored at program step 01, \`10\` is stored at program step 02, and the machine is prompting for data to be input, to be stored at program step 03. = Saving to EEPROM = Before entering a program to volatile memory with the intention of saving this program to EEPROM memory, the EEPROM program space to be saved to must be cleared first, which clears the volatile memory as well as the selected area of the EEPROM memory. Each program step requires 1 byte of memory and each data register requires 7 bytes of memory. When clearing, reading, or writing to the EEPROM memory, the address and range are specified by a six-digit number, preceded by a non-zero number, in automatic mode: e.g. \`1aaaadd\` specifies that \`dd\` bytes are to be stored starting at memory address \`aaaa\`. A two-position data/program switch controls whether data (from the registers) or program memory is transferred; a three-position switch is used to select read, write, and clear operations.  Additional information  = Price = Its original selling price was 115 rubles. = Colours = The MK-52 was made available in a variety of colours, including black and grey, turquoise and blue, white and grey, and orange. = Schematics = In what would be considered an unusual practice today (but was common for Soviet electronics), technical schematics were provided for the MK-52 when it was purchased, facilitating user modification and repair of the machine. Elektronika MK-52 schematics = Error message = MK-52 displaying –ï–ì–ì–û–ì When an error was encountered on the machine, the display produced a message similar to the English word \\"error\\". The word, written in this fashion, cut down on the number of display segments used to display the error message. In Russian, this spelling is not pronounced \\"error\\", but \\"eggog\\". = Games = There is a host of games available for the MK-52. The MK-52's undocumented functions tend to be heavily used in the games due to their ability to make unusual calculations and produce specialised displays. A simple example of the modification of the display is accomplished by the repeated squaring of (and ignoring error messages). = Use in outer space = In November 1988, the MK-52 went into space on the Soyuz TM-7 spacecraft, where it could have been used to calculate the trajectory of landing in the event of an onboard computer failure.  Bugs  There is currently only 1 known bug in the MK-52: that the MAX function gives a result of zero if one of the two arguments of the function is zero.

He was educated at California State University, Chico, California and Central Washington University, Ellensburg, Washington. Career William Morris was first introduced to glass at Pilchuck Glass School, Stanwood, Washington, where he was employed as a bus driver. Early in his career (late 1970s to early 1980s) he was head gaffer for Dale Chihuly. He began making his own work in the 1980s. He relied on the same core team of assistants throughout his career; Karen Willenbrink-Johnsen, Jon Ormbrek, and Randy Walker. Some of the other artists who have worked with his team throughout the years include Blaise Campbell, Ross Richmond, and Trumaine Mason. With the help of Pino signoretto, an Italian glass maestro from Murano, Morris developed new techniques that used oxy/propane torches to spot heat specific sections of a piece allowing for the high level of detail that his work is known for. Morris and his team maintained the William Morris Studio, WA, throughout its duration. Morris' work is an attempt to add to the archeological record of humankind. Instead of focusing on glass's natural beauty, he uses the medium's ability to transform into wood, bone, fiber, and sinew. He is inspired by ancient civilizations, such as Egyptian, Asian, Native American and Latin American. He also draws inspiration from the wilderness and the relationship between man and animal. Morris achieved much success during his career and retired in 2007. He is currently represented at Abmeyer + Wood Fine Art in Seattle, WA. Personal life William Morris grew up in Carmel, California, United States. Later in life while working as a glass artist, he resided in Washington. During breaks from glass making, he spent time in Idaho's Bitterroot Mountains and Pioneer Mountains and Oregon's Wallowa Mountains and Elkhorn Mountains.

From that time Helgemo played with Tor Helness on the open team, which was always strong and won another world silver medal in 2001. Norway finally won the world team championship in 2007, the biennial Bermuda Bowl, with a team of six including Helness‚ÄìHelgemo as anchor pair.

For example, a language contrasting two words * vs. * may evolve historically so that final consonants are dropped, yet the modern language preserves the contrast through the nature of the vowel, as in a pair vs. . Such a situation would be described by saying that a former contrast between oral and nasal consonants has been transphonologized into a contrast between oral vs. nasal vowels. The term transphonologization was coined by Andr√©-Georges Haudricourt.See Haudricourt (1965), Haudricourt (1970). The concept was defined and amply illustrated by Hag√®ge & Haudricourt;Hag√®ge & Haudricourt (1978: 74‚Äì111) it has been mentioned by several followers of Panchronic phonology,E.g. Mazaudon & Lowe (1993); Fran√ßois (2005: 452‚Äì453); Michaud, Jacques & Rankin (2012). and beyond.See Hyman (2013), Kirby (2013). Transphonologization resulting in a new contrast on vowels =Umlaut= A common example of transphonologization is Germanic umlaut. ;Germanic In many Germanic languages around 500‚Äì700 AD, a sound change fronted a back vowel when an or followed in the next syllable. Typically, the or was then lost, leading to a situation where a trace of the original or remains in the fronted quality of the preceding vowel. Alternatively, a distinction formerly expressed through the presence or absence of an or suffix was then re-expressed as a distinction between a front or back vowel. As a specific instance of this, in prehistoric Old English, a certain class of nouns was marked by an suffix in the (nominative) plural, but had no suffix in the (nominative) singular. A word like \\"mouse\\", for example, had a plural \\"mice\\". After umlaut, the plural became pronounced , where the long back vowel was fronted, producing a new subphonemic front-rounded vowel , which serves as a secondary indicator of plurality. Subsequent loss of final , however, made a phoneme and the primary indicator of plurality, leading to a distinction between \\"mouse\\" and \\"mice\\". In this case, the lost sound left a trace in the presence of ; or equivalently, the distinction between singular and plural, formerly expressed through a suffix , has been re-expressed using a different feature, namely the front-back distinction of the main vowel. This distinction survives in the modern forms \\"mouse\\" and \\"mice\\" , although the specifics have been modified by the Great Vowel Shift. ;outside Germanic Similar phenomena have been described in languages outside Germanic. * For example, 17 languages of northern Vanuatu have gone through a process whereby former *CVCV disyllables lost their final vowel, yet preserved their contrast through the creation of new vowels: e.g. *mati vs. *mata vs. *matu transphonologized to vs. vs. .See Fran√ßois (2005), Fran√ßois (2011: 194‚Äì5). This resulted in the expansion of vowel inventories in the region, from an original five-vowel system (*i e a o u) to inventories up to 10 or 11 vowels (depending on the language). =Nasalization of vowels= * In French, a final sound disappeared, but left its trace in the nasalization of the preceding vowel, as in vin blanc , from historical . * In many languages (Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, Oceanic, Celtic‚Ä¶), a vowel was nasalized by the nasal consonant preceding it: this \\"historical transfer of nasality between consonantal onset and vowel\\" is a case of transphonologization.See Michaud, Jacques & Rankin (2012). =Compensatory lengthening= * In American English, the words rider and writer are pronounced with a instead of and as a result of flapping. The distinction between the two words is preserved by (or transferred to) the length of the vowel (or in this case, diphthong), as vowels are pronounced longer before voiced consonants than before voiceless consonants. Before disappearing, a sound may trigger or prevent some phonetic change in its vicinity that would not otherwise have occurred, and which may remain long afterward. For example: * In the English word night, the sound (spelled gh) disappeared, but before, or perhaps as it did so (see \\"compensatory lengthening\\"), it lengthened the vowel , so that the word is pronounced \\"nite\\" rather than the \\"nit\\" that would otherwise be expected for a closed syllable. =Tone languages= *The existence of contrastive tone in modern languages often originates in transphonologization of earlier contrasts between consonants: e.g. a former contrast of consonant voicing (* vs. *) transphonologizes to a tonal contrast (* vs. *) * The tone split of Chinese, where the voiced consonants present in Middle Chinese lowered the tone of a syllable and subsequently lost their voicing in many varieties. * Floating tones are generally the remains of entire disappeared syllables. Transphonologization resulting in a new contrast on consonants * Consonant mutation in Celtic languages (a lost vowel triggered initial consonant lenition, and a lost nasal triggered nasalization). * In Sanskrit, voiced sibilants *z and *≈æ of the Proto-Indo- Iranian language were deleted, which lengthened the preceding vowel. Additionally, the elision of the sound *≈æ resulted in the following voiced dental consonant to become retroflexed, as seen in the development of Proto- Indo-European *nizd√≥s (\\"nest\\") --> Proto-Indo-Iranian *ni≈æd√°s --> Sanskrit nƒ´·∏ç√°·∏•. In case of a plain *z, the preceding vowel was lengthened without causing the retroflexion of the following consonant as seen in Proto-Indo- European *s√≠zdeti (\\"sits down\\") --> Proto-Indo-Iranian *s√≠zdati --> Sanskrit sƒ´ÃÅdati. Other examples * The prevention of sound change by a lost consonant in Lahu; * In Estonian and some other Uralic languages, when case endings are elided, the changed root indicates the presence of the case, see consonant gradation. * In Turkish, ƒü lengthens the preceding vowel, unless when followed by another vowel (which it separates into another syllable) or consonant after or (which becomes pronounced as in such a case. In the Eastern and lower Ankara dialects, it is pronounced as .  Other names  Rephonologization was a term used by Roman Jakobson (1931 [1972]) to refer to essentially the same process but failed to catch on because of its ambiguity. In a 1994 paper, Norman (1994) used it again in the context of a proposed Old Chinese sound change that transferred a distinction formerly expressed through putative pharyngealization of the initial consonant of a syllable to one expressed through presence or absence of a palatal glide before the main vowel of the syllable. Specifically, the glide occurred whenever the initial consonant was not pharyngealized. However, rephonologization is occasionally used with another meaning, referring to changes such as the Germanic sound shift or the Slavic change from to , where the phonological relationships among sounds change but the number of phonemes stays the same. That can be viewed as a special case of the broader process being described here. James Matisoff (1991:443) coined cheshirization as a synonym for transphonologization. The term jokingly refers to the Cheshire Cat, a character in the book Alice in Wonderland, who \\"vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone\\". Cheshirization has been used by some other authors (e.g. John McWhorter in McWhorter 2005, and Hilary Chappell in Chappell 2006).

Global Volcanism Program. Retrieved on March 25, 2012.) is a stratovolcano on Camiguin Island in the Philippines. It is one of the active volcanoes in the country and part of the Pacific ring of fire. Description Volcanologists classify Hibok-Hibok or Catarman Volcano as a stratovolcano and dome complex with an elevation of and a base diameter of . Hibok-Hibok (left) and Mt Vulcan (right), the volcanic cone created in the 1871 flank eruption. It has six hot springs (Ardent Spring, Tangob, Bugong, Tagdo, Naasag and Kiyab), three craters (Kanangkaan Crater, site of the 1948 eruption; Itum Crater, site of 1949 eruption, and Ilihan Crater, site of 1950 eruption). Its adjacent volcanic edifices are Mount Vulcan, high, northwest of Hibok-Hibok; Mount Mambajao, center of Camiguin; Mount Guinsiliban high, southernmost Camiguin; Mount Butay ; and Mount Uhay , N of Mount Guinsiliban. There are also domes and cones at Campana Hill, Minokol Hill, Tres Marias Hill, Mount Carling, Mount Tibane, and Piyakong Hill. Mount Timpoong and Hibok-Hibok form the two major landmarks within the Timpoong and Hibok-Hibok Natural Monument. The natural monument became an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2015. The indigenous Kamigin Manobo are believed to be the original inhabitants of Mount Hibok- Hibok. Eruptions Crater Lake Of Hibok Hibok Volcano Hibok-Hibok has erupted five times in modern history. The first recorded eruption occurred in 1827 and a similar activity followed in 1862. Volcanic activity is currently monitored through solar-powered autonomous stations operated by the Hibok- Hibok Volcano Observatory under the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. =1871 to 1875= On February 16, 1871, earthquakes and subterranean rumblings began to be felt on the island, which increased in severity until April 30 when a volcanic fissure opened up 400 yards southwest of the village of Catarman, on the northwest flank of Hibok-hibok Volcano. From the opening, lava was continuously ejected and poured into the sea for four years, destroying the town. At the same time, the vent built a cone now known as Mt. Vulcan. In 1875, the Challenger expedition visited the area, and described the mountain as a dome, about in height, without any crater, but still smoking and incandescent at the top.Becker, George F. (1901). \\"Report on the Geology of the Philippine Islands\\", p.42-43. Washington Government Printing Office, 1901. The portion of the town containing a cemetery has subsided into the sea and is now marked with a huge white cross off the coast. The settlement was relocated to where the present Catarman town center is now located. The remains of old Catarman, including the ruins of the ancient Spanish church, convent and a bell tower, are now called Gui-ob. =1897 to 1902= In 1897, Hibok-Hibok emitted white sulfurous steam that damaged villages on the island. Solfataric activity continued up to 1902. =1948 to 1951= From 1948 to 1951, Mt. Hibok-Hibok constantly rumbled and smoked. There were also landslides and earthquakes followed by dome building and nuee ardente. The Pel√©an eruption in 1948 from the Kanangkaan crater caused little damage and loss of life. The eruption of 1949, originating from Itum crater caused 79 deaths due to landslides. In the morning of December 4, 1951, the volcano erupted again. This time, however, it unleashed boiling lava, poisonous gases, and landslides enough to destroy nearly of land particularly in Mambajao. All in all, over 3,000 people were killed. Before the eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok in 1951, the population of Camiguin had reached 69,000. After the eruption, the population was reduced to about 34,000 due to massive emigration. Volcanologists observed an eruption pattern observed during the 1948‚Äì1952 eruptions (a cycle of four phases) beginning with a short period of emission of steam from the crater and avalanches of volcanic materials, followed by explosions or steam blast with emission of heavy clouds of steam, ash and other fragmentary volcanic materials with a strong possibility of the development of pyroclastic flows. The third phase involves eruption of incandescent materials, emission of ash and steam in large amounts, formation of flows and occasional minor crater outbursts, and finally a decrease in steam and other ejecta from the crater. Hiking activity Mt. Hibok-Hibok is a popular hiking destination in Camiguin island. A permit from the DENR office in Mambajao is required. It normally takes 3‚Äì5 hours to reach the summit; the usual jump-off is Ardent Hot Springs in Mambajao. Views from the summit include the nearby White Island, Bohol to the north, Eastern Mindanao to the east and the island of Siquijor to the west. The mossy crater of Camiguin's past eruption can also be seen. A solar-powered remote monitoring station located at Hibok-Hibok volcano Mt. Vulcan can be hiked by way of the Stations of the Cross or The Walkway in Bonbon, Catarman. On the trail are the statues depicting the Roman Catholic Stations of the Cross, which are 14 events in the crucifixion of Jesus, at intervals on the climb.

He was a representative to the Congress of Tucum√°n of July 9, 1816, which declared the Independence of Argentina. He was the first rector of the University of Buenos Aires. S√°enz was born in Buenos Aires. He studied at the Real Colegio de San Carlos between 1794 and 1800, gained his degree in 1802, and became a doctor in law in Chuquisaca in 1804, having been ordained as a priest some years before. In 1804, he entered the Academia Carolina as a practising lawyer. He became shortly afterwards a teacher of theology, law and philosophy. In 1805, S√°enz was appointed secretary of the church cabildo, which brought him into the public eye. His appointment was opposed by the Bishop of Buenos Aires, , and they fought publicly, culminating in S√°enz's imprisonment and trial. He was freed thanks to the intervention of the city's cabildo. He took part in the revolutionary events of May 1810 and represented San Luis Province in the 1813 Assembly. Thanks to his profile and links, he was also part of the Lautaro Lodge. In 1812 it was S√°enz that found the dead body of Bishop Lue and suspicion was immediately placed on the younger priest, given the two men's history, an accusation he never shook off. The religious authorities sent him to Luj√°n in a form of exile. He took no further part in church administration.

This may be due to theft, lost documentation, looting, or just information lost to antiquity. In some cases, just the previous or current ownership of the work is disputed, but in other cases the authenticity of the work itself may be thought to be a forgery. During World War II, Nazis stole many works of art from Jewish families, or looted them from cities in the war. Cleveland Museum of Art ‚Äì Apollo Sauroktonos by Praxiteles The Cleveland Museum of Art purchased a bronze sculpture of Apollo Sauroktonos, which some believe to be the only bronze in existence from the original Greek artist Praxiteles. However, the work has an incomplete provenance, and some claim it is a later Roman copy. Louvre ‚Äì Bronze Monkeys Recently there has been debate within the antiques industry regarding a bronze monkey held in the Louvre initially believed to be the work of famous sculptor Giambologna. Following the finding of two other bronze monkeys by British antique dealer Colin Wilson, however, the validity of the monkey held in the Louvre, claimed by 'experts' to be the real work of Giambologna, has been called into question. The Louvre monkey is simply too deep to fit the niche in which it was supposedly situated on the Samson and a Philistine fountain it was originally designed and created for. The quality of the monkey in the Louvre is also up for debate; the form is not lifelike, the fur is not realistic, and the pose does not match the poses of the monkeys in the Uffizi drawing, which is the only evidence for the monkeys being in the niches. Colin Wilson's monkeys, however, do match this drawing, are made of a gunmetal dated to the 16th/17th century, are unrefined, and are of a high lead content, all of which are traits of a work of Giambologna. The debate continues to this day. In July 2008, the Colin Wilson monkeys, along with a newly discovered third, were sold at auction.

An (simple) arc in finite projective geometry is a set of points which satisfies, in an intuitive way, a feature of curved figures in continuous geometries. Loosely speaking, they are sets of points that are far from \\"line-like\\" in a plane or far from \\"plane-like\\" in a three-dimensional space. In this finite setting it is typical to include the number of points in the set in the name, so these simple arcs are called -arcs. An important generalization of the -arc concept, also referred to as arcs in the literature, are the ()-arcs. -arcs in a projective plane In a finite projective plane (not necessarily Desarguesian) a set of points such that no three points of are collinear (on a line) is called a . If the plane has order then , however the maximum value of can only be achieved if is even. In a plane of order , a -arc is called an oval and, if is even, a -arc is called a hyperoval. Every conic in the Desarguesian projective plane PG(2,), i.e., the set of zeros of an irreducible homogeneous quadratic equation, is an oval. A celebrated result of Beniamino Segre states that when is odd, every -arc in PG(2,) is a conic (Segre's theorem). This is one of the pioneering results in finite geometry. If is even and is a -arc in , then it can be shown via combinatorial arguments that there must exist a unique point in (called the nucleus of ) such that the union of and this point is a ( + 2)-arc. Thus, every oval can be uniquely extended to a hyperoval in a finite projective plane of even order. A -arc which can not be extended to a larger arc is called a complete arc. In the Desarguesian projective planes, PG(2,), no -arc is complete, so they may all be extended to ovals. -arcs in a projective space In the finite projective space PG() with , a set of points such that no points lie in a common hyperplane is called a (spatial) -arc.

Croatia is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Croatia is 78. The Croatian rail network carried 19.87 million passengers in 2017. Railway network Croatian railway network. 305x305px The Croatian railway system consists of 2,974 km of rails (of which 248 km is double track). 1,228 km of track (41.3% of the network) is electrified. (End of 2004). There are several major railway routes in the country: * (via Ljubljana, Slovenia) from Dobova via Zagreb, Slavonski Brod and Vinkovci to Tovarnik (and onwards to Belgrade, Serbia), with a connection in Strizivojna- Vrpolje towards Osijek * from Zagreb to Koprivnica * from Zagreb to O≈°tarije and Rijeka * from O≈°tarije to Split * from Zagreb to Sisak (the shortest main route, but highly important) * from Zagreb to Vara≈ædin There are other routes to Slovenia, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, as well as regular overnight trains to Austria and Germany (namely Bavaria). The network enjoyed a limited number of improvements in the 2000s, such as an increase in the maximum speed of the Zagreb-Novska-Vinkovci line: certain sections of the route have had witnessed a rise in maximum speed from 80 km/h to 160 km/h. Railway modernisation is set to be extended further, and a national 'railway investment plan' (with funding totalling over 18 billion HRK through 2012) was announced; following the 2008-09 financial crisis, however, the plan has yet to come to fruition. =Dobova-Tovarnik line (International corridor X)= 305x305px The railway lines M101, M102, M103, M104 and M105 linking Dobova, Zagreb and Tovarnik, operating the length of Croatia east-west via Zagreb, are the country's most important railway line, and part of the Pan-European corridor X. It is also the most advanced and busiest, being completely electrified and consisting mostly of double tracks. It longitudinally crosses Croatia's continental regions Slavonia, Posavina and the Greater Zagreb Region, connecting the most economically developed towns in Croatia with each other. The route is as follows: * Dobova (on the Croatian border with Slovenia) * Zagreb Glavni railway station * Sesvete (track split towards Sisak (electrified)) * Dugo Selo (track split towards Botovo (electrified)) (This is planned as the future corridor 5b) * Ivaniƒá Grad, Kutina * the village of Banova Jaruga (again track split towards Virovitica (non-electrified)) * Novska (track split backwards towards Sisak (electrified)) * Nova Gradi≈°ka * the combined station for the villages Nova Kapela-Batrina (track split towards Po≈æega, and via Pleternica towards Na≈°ice (non-electrified) ) * Slavonski Brod * combined station for the villages Strizivojna-Vrpolje (two track splits: towards Osijek (currently non-electrified) and towards Slavonski ≈†amac (electrified, Croatian border to Bosnia and Herzegovina)) * Vinkovci (four track splits: towards Osijek, Vukovar, ≈Ωupanja and Brƒçko in Bosnia and Herzegovina, before the War of Independence, Vinkovci was a highly important junction station in this part of Europe, both for passengers as well as for freight) * Tovarnik (on the Croatian border with Serbia) At Vinkovci, lines extend towards ≈Ωupanja and Vukovar, both unelectrified. The connection towards Osijek was severely damaged in the Croatian War of Independence. Repairs began in 2003 and in December 2008 the line was fully reopened. = (Zagreb)-Ogulin- Knin-(Split) line = The Ogulin-Knin line, also known as the \\"Liƒçka pruga\\" (en. \\"the Lika line\\") is part of the railway connection between Zagreb and Split. , this line is being heavily upgraded with many sharp bends and grades removed in order to allow tilting trains to travel at nearly full speed on most parts of the track. Reducing travel time from Split to Zagreb by around a third, to 5‚Äì6 hours. This track was not intended as the shortest distance between Zagreb and Split. The line via Martin Brod which forms the border with Bosnia, has been closed to passenger traffic since the wars of the early 1990s. Some of the problems faced include the age of the line; it was constructed 1913-1925 and contained many curves, often in difficult terrain. Services were slow and speeds severely restricted. The modernisation has involved rebuilding entire sections of track, straightening many curvy segments by rerouting portions of the track and renewing the rails, leading to higher operational speeds. The electrification of the line is not scheduled for the near future. Numerous stations along the line that were in the area of Serbian military occupation have been abandoned. Local trains are only functioning between Ogulin-Vrhovine (two per day). From Vrhovine to Knin there is as of 2013 no local passenger transport, even though some stations are in good condition (e.g. Medak, Malovan, Plavno). ICN tilting trains only stop in Gospiƒá and Graƒçac. Some stations are to soon be renovated or rebuilt (Lovinac, Gospic); Croatian Railways, however, currently has no plans to restart local passenger transport. In late September 2014 H≈Ω Putniƒçki prijevoz abandoned the night train 824/825 between Zagreb and Split. = International corridor V = 315x315px The fifth Pan-European corridor has two branches in Croatia, the \\"b\\" and \\"c\\" branch. Corridor Vb enters Croatia in Botovo, and runs to Zagreb. The part from Zagreb to Rijeka should become part of this corridor, as soon as the extension towards Rijeka is built. Corridor Vc is a Pan-European railway line, running north to south within Croatia. It enters Croatia at Beli Manastir on the border with Hungary, and runs through Osijek to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina in Slavonski ≈†amac. It enters Croatia again in Metkoviƒá, in the very south-east of Dalmatia, where it ends at the Ploƒçe harbour. The line crosses the Dobova-Tovarnik line in Strizivojna-Vrpolje. The line is currently being heavily modernised in order to revitalise Ploƒçe's harbour. The part from Strizivojna-Vrpolje towards Slavonski ≈†amac is fully electrified, and recently the modernised catenary has been put into operation. The passenger traffic scheduled from Vinkovci to Slavonski ≈†amac (now performed by electrical power) is still fragmented. The remaining part from Strizivojna-Vrpolje to region of Osijek (heart of the region Slavonia) is scheduled to be electrified, as soon the general overhaul of the line track is completed, after which operating speeds will finally be raised to . The line will stay single track. = The Vinkovci-Osijek line = Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Vinkovci- Osijek line was one of the busiest branch lines of Croatia, linking two regional centres. At the time the line allowed speeds of up to 120 km/h. As a result of the war, only about 10 kilometres of the 35-km line remained intact. Most of the track was dismantled by invading Serb forces, both in the form of vandalism as well as to use the materials in barricades. The reconstruction of this vital route was finally finished in 2008, and today the route is once again fully operational. Test runs with a measuring vehicle were successful, and speeds reaching 80 km/h were attained. The first test train had its maiden voyage along the route on 12 December 2008, and regular revenue service restarted two days later, on 14 December. = The \\"Unska pruga\\" route = The route called Unska pruga (lit. the Una track) that connects Zagreb and Split along the Una river valley was once an integral part of the Yugoslav Railways railway system. Today, this route remains largely unused, since much of the route virtually runs over the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, crossing it multiple times, on the section between Knin and Bihaƒá. Although this route is largely well preserved and electrified at 25 kV/50 Hz (making it compatible with the Croatian electrification system), administrative problems concerning the many border crossings cause this route to be used only for limited freight traffic services. The designated border crossing along the line between the two countries is at the village of Martin Brod. = Network connection problems = There are some rail network connection problems, which have historical causes. When Croatia was part of Yugoslavia, the rail network was consistently connected and managed by Yugoslav Railways. As the Yugoslav constituent states demerged, important rail links were severed.  Istria  Istria has no direct connection through Croatia. Currently, all rail operates through Slovenia, though this is planned to be solved with a tunnel northwestern of Rijeka.  Dubrovnik and Ploƒçe  The Dubrovnik area is again a special case. Dubrovnik and its surrounds are an exclave, divided by the small Neum corridor belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Historically, the Dubrovnik region has been developed through sea travel. There has never been a direct rail link through Croatia to Dubrovnik, and none is planned in the future. A large 760mm narrow-gauge rail network was constructed in the early 20th century, when the Kingdom of Dalmatia as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina were under Austrian control. The rail route to Dubrovnik went from Sarajevo via Mostar and ƒåapljina rather than to Split and Zagreb in Croatia. In 1967 the line from Sarajevo to ƒåapljina was upgraded to standard gauge, and from there extended not to Dubrovnik but to terminate at the nearby Port of Ploƒçe, handling freight via Bosnia. The route from ƒåapljina to Dubrovnik was closed in 1975 by the Yugoslav Government, acting on the advice of foreign transport consultants. This was in spite of the attractive scenery of the route which has been compared to Switzerland's narrow gauge network. Proposals in 1985 to reopen the route were unsuccessful. Direct trains connected Zagreb with Ploƒçe in thirteen hours, via Bosnia and Herzegovina.http://vred.hznet.hr/hzinfo/Default.asp?VL=..397&category;=hzinfo&service;=izvr3&SCREEN;=4&KO;=Zagreb%20Gl.%20Kol.&LANG;=en There are no more passenger trains between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some buses (with H≈Ω-tarification) connect Ploƒçe with Metkoviƒá and stops between both places. The road connection from Ploƒçe to Dubrovnik is and passes through Neum. Zadar From 1966 passenger trains served Zadar and Knin. In around 2013 plans were put forward to upgrade the line so that it could support speeds of up to 120 km/h. However, a Serbian mine was discovered. The project was closed and all rail traffic stopped, and has not begun since. Buses have been introduced to the route, which currently run 3 times in each direction per day. The travel time is roughly the same.  Logo evolution  File:H≈Ω logo.gif25 June 1991‚Äìpresent  Power systems  The original decision in former Yugoslavia was to use 3 kV DC electrification for the railway network. This was performed on the Rijeka‚ÄìZagreb line, which due to the mountainous Gorski kotar region had a need for more powerful trains than the traditional diesel powered ones. Beginning with the modernisation of the Zagreb‚ÄìBelgrade railway line an electrification system of 25 kV/50 Hz was used. Electrification on other lines in Croatia was then made exclusively 25 kV/50 Hz. Later, the majority of the Zagreb-Rijeka line was re-electrified to 25 kV/50 Hz, but until December 2012 there was still a part that under 3 kV DC. Consequentially a power system break existed at Moravice. H≈Ω was considering the purchase of dual-voltage locomotives, as an alternative to full re-electrification of 3 kV DC tracks, but the idea was scrapped for good as all electrified railways in Croatia are now using 25 kV/50 Hz. All railway power systems in Croatia are exclusively of type overhead catenary.  Rolling stock  327x327px Renovated class 1141 built in the 1980s by Konƒçar, Zagreb.

These trains are normally deployed on the mountainous route between the two largest Croatian cities, route Zagreb - Split, but are also sometimes on the InterCity routes in the continental part of the country. In the case of the Zagreb-Split route, this offers passengers a much more comfortable and time-saving journey with regard to previous trains whose journey took 8 hours, whereas the tilting trains take less than 5 and a half hours, and are more quiet and better equipped as well. However, the safety of the tilting trains and their possible technical incompatibility with the conditions of the Croatian railroads are disputed after the 2009 Rudine train derailment, an incident that occurred on 24 July of that year, in which six passengers were killed and 55 were injured in the crash. Approximately 3 years before this fatal derailment, on 24 November 2006, there was another accident in which the train's engineer was killed; the tilting train crashed into a lorry at a railroad crossing that had no ramp or warning lights. Out of eight trainsets that were introduced in 2004, two are therefore out of service. The tilting train services may therefore have to be reduced as there are no longer enough train-sets to serve all scheduled ICN trains and destinations. =Renumbering= In 1993 H≈Ω renumbered all their vehicles. This results in some confusion to the relation to their previous numbers. All other companies, which have been formed after dissolution of J≈Ω have kept the original numbers.  Croatian speed record  The current rail speed record in Croatia is 185 km/h. The record was set on the line between Novska and Nova Gradi≈°ka. The run was performed in order to demonstrate the possibilities offered by the Rade Konƒçar built J≈Ω 442 electric locomotive class (now H≈Ω1142 train class). Despite being over 25 years old the 1 142 remains the fastest locomotive in operation with Croatian railways.  Future developments and projects  * Building a new line between Bjelovar and Zagreb (Railway line Gradec-Sveti Ivan ≈Ωabno). * Suburban rail traffic around Zagreb is to be fully renovated and reorganised. Some local lines previously shut down will be reactivated, and a link to Zagreb Airport has been approved and announced by Zagreb authorities. New EMUs and DMUs have been ordered from Croatian manufacturer Konƒçar KEV. * 2009 or 2010 will see the opening of a newly constructed line to Samobor though following a different route to the previous line. The line will use new rolling stock and help alleviate the trouble currently encountered by those wishing to travel between the two cities * Suburban rail traffic around Split is to begin (has already begun on a small scale). See: Split Suburban Railway * Corridor 5c will be upgraded to allow an operating speed of 160 km/h. This has already been completed between Osijek and Slavonski ≈†amac. * Corridor 5c will be completely electrified (date still unknown) * Dual power engines will be purchased. Some tests with trains from various manufacturers, mostly Siemens Eurosprinter electric engines, have been performed already. * Revitalisation of the Osijek-Vinkovci line recently started, and the line will support maximum speeds of 120 km/h (100 km/h in practice). Since this line was in a badly damaged state the reconstruction will be done in 2 phases. Phase 1 is only the necessary signalling (track crossing signalling through traffic signs only). Due to this fact and the current corresponding Croatian laws, traffic must commence very carefully, and probably trains will have to stop on every crossing and then speed up again. Due to excess costs in phase 1, phase 2 will be deploy automatic track-road protection devices on all crossings, which will finally allow full nominal line speed. = High-speed rail line = A fully electrified line connects Rijeka with Zagreb, onwards towards Koprivnica and the Hungarian border; the railway line forms part of the European 5b corridor. A transportation bill to be passed by the Croatian Parliament will see the start of construction of Croatia's first high-speed rail line along this pan-European corridor, enabling theoretical speeds of between 200 and 250 km/h with an average journey speed of no less than 160 km/h. The plan consists of retrofitting the existing track between the Hungarian border and Karlovac to a double-track configuration, as well as constructing new tracks along an entirely new alignment from Karlovac to Rijeka. The line's complete length will be 269 km, or 61 km shorter than the current line. Construction on the new line was announced to start in the autumn of 2008Kalmeta talks about infrastructural projects in current 4-year plan and was to be completed before the end of 2013. The onset of the economic downturn of the late 2000s has put this project on indefinite hold. The speeds of this line will enable a trip from Rijeka to Zagreb in an hour, as opposed to the current four hours. The initial route plan is described on this link: Initial proposed solution. The line is conceived primarily to better connect the Port of Rijeka to the network of European transport, as the port serves many regions and locales across Central Europe. = Unofficial long term projects= * More usage of the flagship ICN trains (the newest H≈Ω stock acquisition), also on Zagreb-Na≈°ice line (over Nova Kapela-Batrina and Pleternica), additionally to currently running Zagreb- Osijek over Strizivojna-Vrpolje train and to Vara≈ædin. This is the latest news, as announced. Ridership on existing ICN lines proved to be full success. The ICN Zagreb-Osijek, Zagreb-Vara≈ædin and Zagreb-Split ICN lines are almost always at 100% ridership capacity. * Reelectrification and bringing back the destroyed catenary and signals on Novska-Sisak and integration in the full pre-war length and conversion to former known Zagreb-Novska alternative route, also speed increase. * A new, just few kilometers long connection route (branch line) connecting two rail routes around Bjelovar is planned a long time, and, when build, will shorten travel times from Bjelovar to Zagreb (now done over Kri≈æevci). This will be the first entirely original railroad line in Croatia in many years. * Plans to upgrade the Dobova-Tovarnik (Corridor X) to double track at the full length (if the freight traffic increases to pre-war amounts or above that) and higher speeds (above 160 km/h) (talked about since long time). Most of the track damaged sections between Novska and Tovarnik is completely renewed after the Croatian war of independence. This route is the most probable candidate for a track above 200 km/h in the current status, as it is the most modern route, and double track in mostly excellent condition exists currently between shortly before Zagreb and Dugo Selo, and between Novska and Vinkovci. The part of double track existing after Vinkovci to Tovarnik is still being reconstructed, though only one track is currently functioning at reduced speed. This route is protected by security systems (St. Andrew's crosses and ramps) in the whole length. Near Zagreb, and Vinkovci there are even fully separate level crossings with roads. The rest is also mostly separate level crossing. Only the signalling system and overhead catenary would need some adaptations. * The Osijek-Vinkovci line is planned to be electrified after reopening, if justified. Before the war related closure and heavy damage in 1991, it was one of few profitable branch lines. With new changed circumstances (this is now a direct and shortest connection between European corridor Vc and corridor X), it would be economically justified to electrify it, as shortest link between the two corridors towards eastern Europe. * Sisak-Kutina-(Lipovljani), a new short highcapacity railway stretch for the speed of 250 km/h. This will be a link between the corridor X branches over Sisak and Kutina.

His victory put him in the finals of the Olympic trials, where he beat Tolly Thompson 5‚Äì3 and 8‚Äì0 to earn the right to represent the United States again at the 2004 Summer Games. McCoy was a consistent force nationally for a decade, achieving numerous top finishes at the United States National Tournament with a fourth-place finish in 1994; third in 1995; second in 1996 and 1997; fifth in 1998; third in 1999; and first from 2000‚Äì2004. He is a nine-time member of the National Team. In 1998 and 2001, he placed fourth at the World Championships, and he won a silver medal in 2003. In August 2003, McCoy won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games and was honored as the Outstanding Wrestler of the tournament. Coaching career Before his arrival at Lehigh, McCoy served as an assistant at Penn State for three seasons, during which the Nittany Lions posted two fourth-place finishes at the NCAA Tournament and produced 10 All-Americans and two NCAA Champions. McCoy then became an assistant coach with the Lehigh wrestling program in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; in his five seasons there, he coached 14 NCAA All-Americans, including two NCAA Champions, and the program won the EIWA Conference championship four times. McCoy also helped guide Jon Trenge, who weighed to a Lehigh-record 133 victories in his career and three top-three finishes at the NCAA Championships. During his time at Lehigh, McCoy also worked for the Lehigh Valley Athletic Club as a director. In addition, McCoy has served on Athlete Advisory committees for USA Wrestling and the United States Olympic Committee, and has spent multiple seasons on the U.S. Freestyle World Team coaching staff. As head coach of Stanford from 2005 to 2008, McCoy made a strong start with the program, leading the team to a winning record in his first season as a head coach. Under McCoy's guidance, the team finished 2005‚Äì06 with an 8‚Äì7 record in dual meets and improved by two spots at the Pac-10 Championships. In addition, he helped two wrestlers qualify for the NCAA championships and coached Tanner Gardner, a sophomore, to become the 13th All-American in the history of Stanford. During McCoy's second year at the helm of the program, the improvement continued. The Cardinals finished with an 8‚Äì8 dual meet record, and climbed another rung higher, to sixth place, on the Pac-10 ladder. With the help of McCoy, five wrestlers placed in the Pac-10 and Gardner captured the program's first individual Pac-10 title since 2004. All five qualified for the NCAA Championships, one of the highest totals of NCAA qualifiers in Cardinal history. Gardner and Josh Zupancic earned All-America honors, the first Stanford pair to do so in the same season since 1967, while freshman Zack Giesen was named the Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year. In his inaugural season as the head coach of the Terrapins, McCoy led the team to a school-record-tying 10th place NCAA Tournament finish, earning three All-Americans with Steve Bell (133, 6th), Alex Krom (141, 5th) and Hudson Taylor (197, 3rd). McCoy also led the team to an ACC Tournament championship, crowning ACC Champions Brenden Byrne (125), Steve Bell (133), and Alex Krom (141). In the 2009‚Äì10 season, McCoy led the team to a school-record 19 duel meet victories, school-record-breaking career wins and career and season pins for Hudson Taylor, who weighed , McCoy's first regular season conference championship, a runner-up finish at ACC conference championship and a 20th-place finish at the NCAA Championship. Athletes whom McCoy has subsequently coached to All-American status include three-time All American Josh Asper (165), Spencer Myers (285), University World Bronze Medalist Mike Letts (174), and NCAA runner-up Jimmy \\"Headlock\\" Sheptock (174). During the 2014 season, McCoy had the opportunity to coach against the three- time NCAA champion, and fellow Penn State alumni Ed Ruth in the national championship held in Oklahoma City. Personal life McCoy and his wife, Abbie, were married in June in State College, Pennsylvania. The couple resides in College Park, Maryland.

The roadway extends for between the New York Botanical Garden (where its southeast end meets the Bronx River Parkway) and Van Cortlandt Park (where its northwest end meets the Henry Hudson Parkway). The New York City Department of Transportation is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the roadway while the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation is responsible for the surrounding rights-of-way. The parkway is designated as New York State Route 908F (NY 908F), an unsigned reference route, by the New York State Department of Transportation. Route description Mosholu Parkway station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. Mosholu Parkway begins at exit 8E of the Bronx River Parkway. It heads northward as an arterial boulevard through the northern parts of the Bronx. The highway crosses through Bedford Park, passing Bainbridge Avenue. It intersects with the Grand Concourse afterwards, with Jerome Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue and West Gun Hill Road soon after. Within Van Cortlandt Park, the parkway becomes a limited-access freeway, with exits for the southbound Major Deegan Expressway (Interstate 87) and the Henry Hudson Parkway near its northern terminus at the Westchester County line (where it turns into the Saw Mill River Parkway). A bikeway, part of the East Coast Greenway, runs along the northeast side of the parkway from Bronx Park to Van Cortlandt Park, connecting through the park to other trails and playing fields and to Broadway. History = Etymology = There are conflicting accounts as to what \\"Mosholu\\" is derived from. According to one account, \\"Mosholu\\" is an Algonquin word meaning \\"smooth stones\\" or \\"small stones\\", and was first applied to the nearby creek now known as Tibbetts Brook. The southern end of the parkway was once home to another creek called Schuil Brook, running under what is now Middlebrook Road, which supplied water to a British fort located on old Van Cortlandt Avenue East during the American Revolutionary War. According to another etymology, Mosholu is a contraction of the name of the Choctaw chief Mushulatubbee. The Choctaw were not local to New York, but Mushulatubbee was well known for his assistance to the US during the War of 1812. A variant form of the contracted name was given to two ships; the USS Mashula (launched as USS Severn in 1867) and the SS Moshulu. The latter ship was apparently named with the understanding that it was a Seneca word meaning fearless.Robert S. Grumet, Manhattan to Minisink: American Indian Place Names of Greater New York and Vicinity, University of Oklahoma Press, 2013 . p. 219. = Context = In the 1870s, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned a greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align with existing geography. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan. Around the same time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly pushed for the creation of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. There were objections to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the parks' sites. However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house). In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of the park system. The system consisted of three parkways and six parks, with Bronx Park at the center of the system. Bronx Park was connected to Van Cortlandt Park in the northwest via Mosholu Parkway; to Pelham Bay Park in the east via Pelham Parkway; and to Crotona Park in the south via Crotona Parkway. There were no direct connections to Claremont Park and St. Mary's Park, the other two parks in the system. = Reconstruction = The road was reconstructed between 1935 and 1937, including widening the entire parkway, making the section from the Saw Mill to Gun Hill Road, replacing the intersection at Jerome Avenue with an overpass, and installing a wide median between Marion Avenue and Grand Concourse.

Influenced by Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Vernant developed a structuralist approach to Greek myth, tragedy, and society which would itself be influential among classical scholars. He was an honorary professor at the Coll√®ge de France.  Biography  Born in Provins, France, Vernant at first studied philosophy, receiving his agr√©gation in this field in 1937. A member of the Young Communists (Jeunes Communistes), Vernant joined the French Resistance during World War II and was a member of Lib√©ration-sud (founded by Emmanuel d'Astier). He later commanded the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) in Haute-Garonne under the pseudonym of \\"Colonel Berthier.\\" He was a Companion of the Liberation. After the war, he remained a member of the French Communist Party until 1969. He entered the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in 1948 and, under the influence of Louis Gernet, turned to the study of ancient Greek anthropology. Ten years later, he became director of studies at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (EHESS). In 1971 he was professor in the University of S√£o Paulo. Official Webpage of the Faculty of Philosophy (University of S√£o Paulo) This visit was also an act of protest that he made with Fran√ßois Ch√¢telet against the brazilian military government (dictatorship). He was a member of the French sponsorship committee for the Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. He supported the funding organisation Non-Violence XXI. He was awarded the CNRS gold medal in 1984. In 2002, he received an honorary doctorate at the University of Crete. Vernant died a few days after his 93rd birthday in S√®vres. After his death, his name was given to a French highschool in S√®vres, le \\"Lyc√©e Jean-Pierre Vernant\\".  Influence  The structuralist approach pioneered by Vernant has been influential on a wide range of classical scholars. More specifically, Vernant's reading of the myth of Prometheus was an important influence on philosopher Bernard Stiegler's book, Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus.  Criticism  Vernant's approach has been heavily criticized, particularly among Italian philologists, even by those of Marxist tendencies. He has been accused of a fundamentally ahistorical approach, allegedly going as far as to manipulate his sources by describing them in categories which do not apply (polysemy and ambiguity).Vincenzo Di Benedetto, La tragedia greca di Jean-Pierre Vernant, in: Belfagor 32 (1977), p. 461-468; see also Vincenzo Di Benedetto, L'ambiguo nella tragedia greca: una categoria fuorviante, in: Euripide \\"Medea\\", introd. di V.

It received royal assent in 1846 but construction was delayed until 1851 because of the adverse economic conditions existing in the United Kingdom. The railway was built in two phases with the section from Elgin to Lossiemouth completed in 1852. When the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (I&AJR;) reached Keith via Elgin, the Morayshire was able to complete the Speyside second phase by connecting the Craigellachie line at Orton. Initially, the Morayshire ran its own locomotives on the I&AJR; track between Elgin and Orton but this was short-lived and the Morayshire carriages were then hauled to Orton by the I&AJR.; Disagreements with the I&AJR; eventually forced the Morayshire into constructing a new section of track between its stations at Elgin and Rothes; this was completed in 1862. The Morayshire accomplished its final enlargement by connecting to the new Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) Craigellachie station in 1863. Crippling debt forced the company into an arrangement with the GNoSR for it to assume operation of the track in 1866. By 1881, the Morayshire had greatly reduced its debt and its long-sought-after amalgamation with the GNoSR finally took place. Elgin to Lossiemouth =Concept to development= James Grant, an Elgin solicitor, later to become Provost of Elgin, and co-owner with his brother of the Glen Grant distillery at Rothes, first envisaged the construction of a railway between Elgin and Lossiemouth in 1841.Vallance, Great North,p. 37 A ground survey showed that the line was feasible and could be built relatively cheaply but there was little financial support for the enterprise. On 3 February 1844 and still steadfast in his belief in the project, Grant addressed the board of the Elgin and Lossiemouth Harbour Company in an effort to gain their support‚Äîthe board's opinion was that there was little need for railways north of Dundee, let alone one between the two towns.Ross, Travellers Joy, p. 1 Following the harbour company's own investigation, it changed its opinion and gave it their backing.Barclay-Harvey, History of Great North, p. 28 In the mid-1840s, railway mania swept throughout the United Kingdom.Vallance, Great North, p. 19 At a meeting arranged by the supporters of an Inverness to Elgin railway on 19 February 1845, it was generally agreed that such a railway would be beneficial. Grant addressed the meeting stating that he had no objection but warned the people of Elgin that Lossiemouth harbour was important to Elgin and that they should be wary of companies who could interfere with the free trade that came through the port.Ross, Travellers Joy, p. 2 These warnings were heeded and Grant succeeded in resurrecting the scheme as the Morayshire Railway at a meeting held on 3 March 1845.Barclay-Harvey, History of Great North, pp. 28, 29 At a further meeting held on 11 April, it was also decided that the track would extend south to Craigellachie.Ross, Travellers Joy, p. 3 Measures were taken to seek parliamentary authority in 1846 but before the Bill was presented the GNoSR was created. A decision was taken that the two railways would connect at Elgin and the Morayshire Railway would connect its Speyside line to Craigellachie at Orton.Thomas, Forgotten Railways, p. 190 The company's capital was agreed at ¬£50,000.Barclay-Harvey, History of Great North, p. 29¬£50,000 in 1841 was worth around ¬£145,800,000 in 2017 Parliamentary approval for this scheme were obtained on 10 July 1846 but financial panic gripped the United Kingdom in 1847 and the entire project was shelved.Barclay-Harvey, History of Great North, pp. 29, 30 An internal crisis developed within the company following a change of some the directors. The board declared that powers would be requested to abandon plans for the Craigellachie extension as there was no sign of the GNoSR starting their scheme. Some Edinburgh based shareholders‚Äîwith the financial upheaval of the previous few years feared that the entire project was no longer viable‚Äîattempted to get the entire railway cancelled at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held on 24 February 1851 using the Abandonment of Railways Act, 1850. This motion was carried by 1800 shares to 677. Provost Grant suspected that due processes had not been observed and protested to the Railway Commissioners who on 21 March 1851 called for a list of shareholders who had attended the abandonment EGM‚Äîthe Commissioners found that the necessary shares owned by those attending were insufficient for an abandonment.Ross, Travellers Joy, p. 7 The Edinburgh shareholders withdrew their support placing the company in a critical position. The Railway Commissioners granted the abandonment of the Craigellachie section on 10 July and agreed that the capital of the company be reduced to ¬£29,700.¬£29,700 in 1851 was worth around ¬£91,970,000 in 2017Barclay-Harvey, History of Great North, p. 30 However, it was not until Elgin Town Council agreed to invest ¬£1,000¬£1000 in 1851 was worth about ¬£3,930,000 in 2017 in shares and Colonel Brander of Pitgaveny made a large addition to his already substantial holding that the contract for the Elgin to Lossiemouth section was placed.Vallance, The Great North, pp. 37,38 =Construction and opening= Hutchings & Co were awarded the contract and the first sod was cut at Bareflathills just outside Elgin near the River Lossie by the wife of James Grant on Saturday, 30 November 1851. A large cheering crowd witnessed the ceremony amid the firing of cannons.Bartlam, Moray's Railways p.6 This point was chosen because it possessed the three most difficult engineering features to be overcome‚Äîthe bridge over the River Lossie, the road bridge over the track and the very deep cutting. BareflathillsThe contractor switched to two 12-hour shifts and had a workforce of around 300 navvies.Ross, Travellers Joy, p. 11 It was reported at the Board meeting held on 2 April 1852, that although the track was half- finished a strike within the workforce had provoked a serious disturbance. There were two stories in circulation regarding the incident. The first of these was that Irish navvies had come onto the job undercutting the locals‚Äô wages and the other was that the contractor, who was from England, employed English labour and it was they who objected to the Irish.Vallance, The Great North, p. 38 The outcome was that a clash of some sort had taken place and that four of the instigators were arrested and sentenced to various periods of hard labour‚Äîa fifth person was to be sent to the Court of Judiciary for trial after assaulting the Sheriff.Ross, Travellers Joy, pp. 11, 12 The result of all this was that the Morayshire Railway was ordered to pay for ten additional police constables to regulate the workforce. It had been decided that the opening date would be Tuesday 10 August 1852 but at the board meeting on 31 July, it was reported that the locomotives had not arrived from Messrs Neilson & Co of Glasgow‚Äîone day later the boat containing the engines docked at Lossiemouth.Ross, Travellers Joy, p. 13 The two locomotives bought for the line were small 2-2-0 tank engines costing a total of ¬£2622 7s. 8¬Ωd,Barclay- Harvey, History of Great North, p. 31¬£2622 in 1852 was worth about ¬£7,803,000 in 2017 and were named by the company, Elgin and Lossiemouth.Thomas, Forgotten Railways, p. 187 The Board of Trade Engineer inspected the line on 4 August and travelled in a locomotive a day later and declared himself satisfied with the railway and rolling stock.Ross, Travellers Joy, p. 14 On 10 August 1852, a general holiday was declared in Elgin and Lossiemouth and the directors of the company along with other local dignitaries walked at the head of a procession from the town centre, at St Giles Church, to the station where accompanied by celebratory cannon firing, they were given a rousing send-off.Ross, Travellers Joy, pp. 16, 17 Some people instead walked to Lossiemouth to see the train arrive. The board of the Elgin and Lossiemouth Harbour Company met the passengers and escorted them to the recently opened Steamboat and Railway Hotel where they were entertained. They then proceeded to a large marquee erected overlooking the station on top of the quarry cliffs where many people made fine speeches before lunch was served.Ross, Travellers Joy, pp. 17‚Äì20 The celebrations included sports and games. The Board and prominent citizens met later that evening for a commemorative dinner. The trains ran all day until midnight and carried around 3000 passengers. =Operation= The day following the opening event, a regular five return journeys per day, Monday to Saturday, was instituted. Soon after, the frequency was reduced to four return journeys per day but then in 1857, it was increased to six return journeys reflecting the increased use of the harbour for exporting and importing materials. It took the trains 15 minutes to run the 5¬Ω miles including the conditional stops at Linksfield Level Crossing and Greens of Drainie. These stops were abandoned in 1859.Vallance, The Great North, pp. 38, 39 A first and second class service was provided until 1855 then a first and third thereafter, the fares being 1¬Ωd and 1d per mile respectively. There was little difference in the coach seating layouts, only in the quality of the seats. The first year saw the company run a decent profit and the investors were rewarded with a 5% dividend but the dividend in 1858 was halved to 2¬Ω% due to a reduction in revenue because Lossiemouth harbour was closed for four months for basin enlargement.Ross, Travellers Joy, p. 40 This was discussed at the annual general meeting in the following October‚Äîat this meeting the main instigator of the railway, James Grant was elected chairman.Vallance, The Great North, p. 39 Taylor and Cranstoun's coupling device Joseph Taylor and Charles Cranstoun, the company's Engineer and General Manager respectively, designed an ingenious device for the coupling and uncoupling of carriages and locomotives thereby removing a significant hazard that claimed many lives annually across Britain. It operated very successfully on the Morayshire line and was highly regarded by railway experts but faced reluctance by other railway companies for its adoption‚Äîit is unclear if any other railways also used it. The Mechanic's Magazine after having seen the device in operation, wrote: Within a short time of co-designing the coupling device, Joseph Taylor was killed in an accident near Oakenhead Bridge just outside Lossiemouth on 23 April 1857. He was driving a tank locomotive which collided with a ballast train. In the same year also near Lossiemouth, a passenger was killed when a badly secured barrier gave way on a truck.Levi, Annals of British Legislation, Series D - \\"Railways, Shipping &c.;\\", Chap. LXXX 'Railway Accidents' (1857) p.168 The Craigellachie enlargement =Construction and obstruction= By March 1858, the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (I&AJR;) had reached Elgin and completed its junction with GNoSR at Keith on 18 August.Thomas, Forgotten Railways, pp. 189,190 The Morayshire Railway completed the 3¬Ω miles of track from Orton station to Rothes and opened to passenger traffic on 23 August 1858‚Äîthis allowed the Morayshire Railway to resurrect its plans to build a railway between Rothes and Craigellachie and this section was completed on 23 December 1858.Barclay-Harvey, History of Great North, p. 32 It terminated, however, on the west bank of the River Spey so as not to incur the expense of a bridge.The Morayshire company would, under its agreement with the I&AJR;, work its own trains on the Elgin - Orton section but without permission to stop for passengers. The engines used by the Morayshire Railway were small and prone to breakdown and unsuitable for the steeper gradients on this section of track‚Äîtheir use lasted only six weeks.Bartlam, Moray's Railways, p. 15 The I&AJR; blamed the Morayshire for causing delays in its own schedules and insisted on the Morayshire coaches being attached to its own and taken to Orton‚Äîrelations between the two companies deteriorated rapidly and a dispute over charging for line use ensued.Ross, Travellers Joy pp. 68, 69 Matters came to a head when I&AJR; held back the Morayshire Railway goods until the I&AJR; goods were ready to be forwarded either to or from Orton. Birchfield Platform in 1961 This caused difficulties with onward transmission of goods from and to Lossiemouth Harbour. Seemingly deliberate schemes were being devised to obstruct the Morayshire coaches from entering onto the I&AJR; line. The two companies came to an agreement and the Morayshire Railway announced to its long suffering passengers that agreement had been reached and that delays should no longer happen.Ross, Travellers Joy p. 68 Meanwhile, the Morayshire had borrowed to its limit, its shares were not attracting buyers and debt levels were large and growing. Problems with I&AJR; re-surfaced and traffic on the Morayshire line was being severely disrupted‚Äîthe I&AJR; then submitted a bill to the Morayshire Railway for ¬£900 as its share of the construction of Orton station.Ross, Travellers Joy pp. 72, 74 The Morayshire Railway Company decided to free itself from any involvement with I&AJR; and to build a new direct line from Elgin through the Glens of Rothes to meet its own Speyside line.Thomas, Forgotten Railways, p. 192 With the levels of debt carried by company, the brothers James and John Grant loaned the Morayshire ¬£4500 to help fund the new track‚Äîroyal assent was given in 1861 and the work was completed on 1 January 1862.Vallance, The Great North, p. 43¬£4,500 in 1861 was worth about ¬£9,500,000 in 2017 Two more powerful locomotives, 2-4-0 tank engines, would operate this route as the line was steeply graded for the first 6 of its 9 miles. These were named Glen Grant and Lesmurdie.Thomas, Forgotten Railways, p. 193 The effect of the dispute with the I&AJR; was to make the Morayshire Railway open negotiations with the GNoSR who bought ¬£10,000 of shares to help with the building of the direct line to Rothes.Ross, Travellers Joy p. 81¬£10,000 in 1861 was worth about ¬£21,310,000 in 2017 The I&AJR; viewed the involvement of the GNoSR in the Morayshire as a threat to themselves and, in a tit-for-tat fashion, started work on the Burghead branch to take business from Lossiemouth harbour and thus, goods traffic from the Morayshire.Ross, Travellers Joy pp. 85, 89, 100 In October 1860 the I&AJR; made what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to keep the GNoSR out of Elgin by proposing to the Morayshire Board an amalgamation of their two companies. This obligated the Morayshire to put the proposal to the shareholders at a meeting on 31 October‚Äîthe board, with the past record of dealings with the I&AJR;, persuaded the shareholders that independence from them was the best way forward.Ross, Travellers Joy p. 82 The GNoSR agreed to take over the running of the network as soon as the Morayshire constructed a viaduct across the Spey connecting with the GNoSR's Dufftown line. The direct link between Elgin and Rothes opened to passengers on 1 January 1862 (freight traffic had opened a day earlier) while the viaduct over the River Spey‚Äîconstructed at a cost of ¬£12,199 1s 4d‚Äîwas completed on 1 June 1863 joining the GNoSR controlled track at Craigellachie on 1 July.Vallance, The Great North, pp. 44,45 Mills, The Craigellachie Viaduct, p. 236 The original station was now renamed Dandaleith and the new one assumed the Craigellachie name.Barclay-Harvey, History of Great North, p. 35 In 1866 the GNoSR took over the track and without consultation with the Morayshire, closed the Rothes to Orton line to passenger traffic‚Äîmuch to the Morayshire's annoyance.Thomas, Forgotten Railways, p. 197 By a series of small Speyside railways, nominally independent but controlled by the GNoSR, it joined track with the Morayshire Railway at Craigellachie and finally got its independent route to Elgin.Barclay-Harvey, History of Great North, pp. 34, 35 On 30 July 1866, the GNoSR was granted consent to consolidate its series of small Speyside companies and to take the Morayshire Railway under its full ownership when terms and the debt issues had been resolved.Vallance, The Great North, p. 46 Amalgamation Relations between the Morayshire and GNoSR had soured in 1865 when the larger company wanted to take over its smaller partner under very unfavourable terms as a way of recovering the money it was owed‚Äîthe debt carried by the Morayshire had become intolerable and on 14 August 1865, the City of Glasgow Bank refused further loans on top of the ¬£38,172 16s 9d already owed.Ross, The Travellers Joy, pp. 119-125¬£38172 in 1865 was worth about ¬£69,490,000 in 2017 Loans to various lenders included ¬£15211¬£15211 in 1865 was worth about ¬£27,680,000 in 2017 to the Commercial Bank and ¬£12620¬£12620 in 1865 was worth about ¬£22,980,000 in 2017 to the GNoSR. Despite great efforts, no solution to paying off the debt could be found. The relationship between the GNoSR and the Morayshire continued to worsen. In late 1867, James Grant, the Morayshire Chairman made tentative enquiries with The Highland Railway (successor company to I&AJR;) regarding an amalgamation of their two companies and in early 1868 a statement regarding the terms of a possible amalgamation was produced. The GNoSR, when made aware of the statement immediately set about safeguarding its investment in the Morayshire with negotiations between the two big companies eventually leading to the Highland withdrawing the amalgamation terms.Ross, The Travellers Joy, pp. 127‚Äì132 After a short illness, the Morayshire chairman James Grant died on 23 May 1872, aged 70. His public funeral took place on 28 May during which all shops and businesses in Elgin were closed.Young, Annals of Elgin, p. 344 Gradually over the next few years, thanks mainly to the General Manager, Alexander Watt, the Morayshire introduced cost-cutting measures and revenue raising schemes. Rail travel for both goods and passengers increased greatly. The herring fishing at Lossiemouth coupled with such attractions as the public swimming baths at the port attracted visitors in large numbers allowing the Morayshire to pay back outstanding debts to most of its creditors.Ross, Travellers Joy p. 161 The GNoSR acknowledged that the Morayshire was now on a sound footing and so in 1880 negotiations between the companies resumed and the enabling act for the amalgamation was given Royal Assent on 11 August 1881. This ended the Morayshire Railway's 35-year existence. Subsequent history The line from Elgin to Craigellachie was closed in 1968 to all traffic: the section from Elgin to Lossiemouth was closed in 1964 to passengers and 1966 to freight. Most of the Lossiemouth line has been converted to a public footpath. Lossiemouth station is now a leisure area and the platforms are still in existence.

It is a secreted protein that performs many cellular functions, including the control of cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. In humans, TGF-Œ≤1 is encoded by the TGFB1 gene.  Function  TGF-Œ≤ is a multifunctional set of peptides that controls proliferation, differentiation, and other functions in many cell types. TGF-Œ≤ acts synergistically with TGFA in inducing transformation. It also acts as a negative autocrine growth factor. Dysregulation of TGF-Œ≤ activation and signaling may result in apoptosis. Many cells synthesize TGF-Œ≤ and almost all of them have specific receptors for this peptide. TGF-Œ≤1, TGF-Œ≤2, and TGF-Œ≤3 all function through the same receptor signaling systems. TGF-Œ≤1 was first identified in human platelets as a protein with a molecular mass of 25 kilodaltons with a potential role in wound healing. It was later characterized as a large protein precursor (containing 390 amino acids) that was proteolytically processed to produce a mature peptide of 112 amino acids. TGF-Œ≤1 plays an important role in controlling the immune system, and shows different activities on different types of cell, or cells at different developmental stages. Most immune cells (or leukocytes) secrete TGF-Œ≤1. = T cells= Some T cells (e.g. regulatory T cells) release TGF-Œ≤1 to inhibit the actions of other T cells. Interleukin 1- and interleukin 2-dependent proliferation of activated T cells, and the activation of quiescent helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells is prevented by the activity of TGF-Œ≤1. Similarly, TGF-Œ≤1 can inhibit the secretion and activity of many other cytokines including interferon-Œ≥, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) and various interleukins. It can also decrease the expression levels of cytokine receptors, such as the IL-2 receptor to down-regulate the activity of immune cells. However, TGF-Œ≤1 can also increase the expression of certain cytokines in T cells and promote their proliferation, particularly if the cells are immature. = B cells = TGF-Œ≤1 has similar effects on B cells that also vary according to the differentiation state of the cell. It inhibits proliferation and stimulates apoptosis of B cells, and plays a role in controlling the expression of antibody, transferrin and MHC class II proteins on immature and mature B cells. = Myeloid cells = The effects of TGF-Œ≤1 on macrophages and monocytes is predominantly suppressive; this cytokine can inhibit the proliferation of these cells and prevent their production of reactive oxygen (e.g. superoxide (O2‚àí)) and nitrogen (e.g. nitric oxide (NO)) intermediates. However, as with other cell types, TGF-Œ≤1 can also have the opposite effect on cells of myeloid origin. For example, TGF-Œ≤1 acts as a chemoattractant, directing an immune response to some pathogens; macrophages and monocytes respond to low levels of TGF-Œ≤1 in a chemotactic manner. Furthermore, the expression of monocytic cytokines (including interleukin-1(IL-1)-alpha, IL-1-beta, and TNF-Œ±), and phagocytic killing by macrophages can be increased by the action of TGF-Œ≤1. TGF-Œ≤1 reduces the efficacy of the MHC II in astrocytes and dendritic cells, which in turn decreases the activation of appropriate helper T cell populations.

Among his noted contributions to archaeology are his work (including several documentaries) about the Angkor civilization in Cambodia, and his current work in Northeast Thailand. He is a research professor at the University of Otago in Dunedin. Early years and education Higham was educated at Raynes Park County Grammar School in South London. It was here that he developed an interest in archaeology after volunteering to excavate at the Bronze Age site of Snail Down and Arcy sur Cure in France. In 1957, he was offered a place at St Catharine's College, Cambridge to read archaeology and anthropology. However, being too young for National Service, he spent two years at the Institute of Archaeology, London University, specialising in the archaeology of the western Roman provinces under Sheppard Frere. His teachers included Sir Max Mallowan, the husband of Agatha Christie, and Dame Kathleen Kenyon. During his time at the Institute, he excavated at the Roman city of Verulamium, and the Iron Age site of Camp du Charlat in France. In 1959, he went up to Cambridge, and studied the Neolithic Bronze and Iron Ages of Europe. His contemporaries included Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, Sir Barry Cunliffe, Sir Paul Mellars and the Crown Princess of Denmark. He took a double first, was elected a Scholar of his college in 1960, and played for Cambridge University against Oxford in the University rugby matches of 1961-62. He was provided with a State Scholarship in 1962, and embarked on his doctoral research on the prehistoric economic history of Switzerland and Denmark. In 1966 he was awarded his doctorate. During the course of his research he played rugby for Bedford, Eastern Counties and became an England triallist in 1963-64. In 1964, he married Polly Askew. They have two sons and two daughters. Career Following the completion of his doctorate, Higham accepted a lectureship in archaeology at the University of Otago, and in December 1966 he moved to New Zealand with his family. In 1968, he was appointed the foundation professor of anthropology at the University of Otago. Following a visit to the University of Hawaii, he was invited by Professor W.G. Solheim II to undertake research in Thailand, and in 1969, he began his fieldwork with excavations in Roi Et and Khon Kaen Provinces. He joined Chester Gorman between 1972 and 1975 for excavations at Ban Chiang, Pang Mapha District's Banyan Valley Cave, and has subsequently excavated the sites of Ban Na Di (1981‚Äì82), Khok Phanom Di (1984‚Äì85), Nong Nor (1989‚Äì92), Ban Lum Khao (1995‚Äì96), Noen U-Loke (1999-2000), Ban Non Wat (2002-07) and Non Ban Jak (2011‚Äì17). His research at the Bronze Age sites of Ban Non Wat has shown that the initial Bronze Age in this part of Southeast Asia began in the 11th century BCE. With his son, Thomas, professor of archaeological science at Oxford University, he has re-dated the site of Ban Chiang, showing that there too, contrary to claims from the University of Pennsylvania, bronze casting also began in the 11th century BCE. His current research involves excavations at the Iron Age site of Non Ban Jak. There, he has identified for the first time in Thailand, an extensive area comprising the residential quarter of an Iron Age town, complete with houses, a lane, an iron working area and several ceramic kilns. In conjunction with many colleagues, he has linked a period of increased aridity with the start of an agricultural revolution that stimulated the rise of early states. In July 2018, he was a co-author of a pioneering publication on ancient human prehistoric DNA from several sites in Southeast Asia. The result identified a series of population movements beginning with the arrival of anatomically modern humans over 50,000 years ago and involving at a later date, the expansion of rice farmers from the Yangtze Valley. He is now following this up, in conjunction with colleagues in Denmark, with the analysis of aDNA from his most recently excavated site at Non Ban Jak in Northeast Thailand.

History Settlement activity in the Lund area began with the completion of the railway line through the Escalante Valley in the winter of 1898-99, but Lund's population remained extremely small until 1911, when the valley was opened to homestead settlement. The Lund townsite was platted in 1913, beginning a decade of relative activity at the location. The town was named for Robert C. Lund, who was a Utah State legislator, local mine owner, and a director of the Union Pacific Railroad. A population decline began in the 1920s, however, due to the failure of most of the homestead-era farms. Lund's most dramatic event was in February 1922, when a freak flood struck the desert valley and partially inundated the town. Lund gained importance as a railroad junction in 1923, when the Union Pacific constructed a branch line from Lund to Cedar City. The branch was constructed in part to encourage travel to southern Utah's National Parks, and carried passenger trains during the summer months until 1960. At other times, passengers bound for Cedar City would board a railway-operated connecting bus at Lund, which followed State Route 19 (Lund Highway). As part of this construction program, the railroad erected what was the historic town's most prominent building, a stately depot designed by noted architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood. The last passenger trains stopped in Lund in 1969, and the depot building was razed the following year, marking the end of the town's railway prominence. A post office operated at Lund from 1901 to 1967. Its closure reflected years of gradual population decline in the area, and only a handful of people live in the Lund vicinity today.

Finite CA-groups are of historical importance as an early example of the type of classifications that would be used in the Feit‚ÄìThompson theorem and the classification of finite simple groups. Several important infinite groups are CA-groups, such as free groups, Tarski monsters, and some Burnside groups, and the locally finite CA-groups have been classified explicitly. CA-groups are also called commutative-transitive groups (or CT- groups for short) because commutativity is a transitive relation amongst the non-identity elements of a group if and only if the group is a CA-group. History Locally finite CA-groups were classified by several mathematicians from 1925 to 1998. First, finite CA-groups were shown to be simple or solvable in . Then in the Brauer-Suzuki-Wall theorem , finite CA-groups of even order were shown to be Frobenius groups, abelian groups, or two dimensional projective special linear groups over a finite field of even order, PSL(2, 2f) for f ‚â• 2. Finally, finite CA-groups of odd order were shown to be Frobenius groups or abelian groups in , and so in particular, are never non-abelian simple. CA-groups were important in the context of the classification of finite simple groups. Michio Suzuki showed that every finite, simple, non- abelian, CA-group is of even order. This result was first extended to the Feit‚ÄìHall‚ÄìThompson theorem showing that finite, simple, non-abelian, CN-groups had even order, and then to the Feit‚ÄìThompson theorem which states that every finite, simple, non-abelian group is of even order. A textbook exposition of the classification of finite CA-groups is given as example 1 and 2 in . A more detailed description of the Frobenius groups appearing is included in , where it is shown that a finite, solvable CA-group is a semidirect product of an abelian group and a fixed-point-free automorphism, and that conversely every such semidirect product is a finite, solvable CA-group. Wu also extended the classification of Suzuki et al. to locally finite groups. Examples Every abelian group is a CA-group, and a group with a non-trivial center is a CA- group if and only if it is abelian. The finite CA-groups are classified: the solvable ones are semidirect products of abelian groups by cyclic groups such that every non-trivial element acts fixed-point-freely and include groups such as the dihedral groups of order 4k+2, and the alternating group on 4 points of order 12, while the nonsolvable ones are all simple and are the 2-dimensional projective special linear groups PSL(2, 2n) for n ‚â• 2. Infinite CA-groups include free groups, PSL(2, R), and Burnside groups of large prime exponent, . Some more recent results in the infinite case are included in , including a classification of locally finite CA-groups. Wu also observes that Tarski monsters are obvious examples of infinite simple CA-groups.

Early Life and Career Beverly Ashe was born on October 29th, 1941 in Fall River, Nova Scotia, to parents Arthur and Gwendolyn Ashe. The Ashe family moved to Toronto in the early 1950s, when Beverly was a teenager. After completing high school, Beverly Ashe worked as a receptionist at Toronto Barber and Beauty Supply. Within six months she was working as an assistant to the company's president. During this time she quickly noticed a business niche that needed to be filled - black hair-care products were scarce. In 1964 she married Emerson Mascoll, a fellow Nova Scotian who also moved to Toronto. Their son, Eldon Mascoll, was born in 1970.  Mascoll Beauty Supply Ltd.  Beverly Mascoll incorporated her own company, Mascoll Beauty Supply Ltd. in 1970, with only $700. She began selling products out of her truck and home, before flying to Chicago to convince U.S. manufacturer Johnson Products (at the time the largest manufacturer of beauty products) to grant her the rights to be the company's first and only Canadian distributor. By 1971 Mascoll Beauty Supply was the leading distributor of black beauty products in Canada, and went on to become a multi-million dollar business and a major player in the beauty supply industry. In addition to a chain of retail outlets, the company also manufactured and distributed products across the country. By the 1980s the business had expanded to include beauty demonstrations, conferences and professional hair care seminar. In 1984 Mascoll held the first ever Black beauty products trade show in Canada. By 1998 Mascoll's company carried 3,000 beauty care products, and operated a chain of retail outlets. These retail outlets were a hub for many new Black-Canadian immigrants. The stores were a validation of their identity in a new country.  Education and Community Activism  Community activism ran parallel to Mascoll's business endeavors. She was involved with several community organizations including the Harry Jerome Scholarship Fund (awarding excellence to Black-Canadian achievers), Camp Jumoke (a camp for children with Sickle Cell Anemia) and the Ontario Black History Society. Mascoll also led fundraising efforts to establish the first Black Canadian Studies program at Nova Scotia's Dalhousie University. In 1996, she founded the Beverly Mascoll Community Foundation to assist \\"youth, women and people of color\\". Education also played a significant role in Mascoll's life. She was keen on educating her customers, organizing trade events and seminars specific to her clientele. Mascoll was also passionate about her own educational pursuits. Not being able to afford a university education after high-school, Mascoll, at age 55, enrolled full-time in the Women's Studies program at York University. She received her Bachelor of Arts in 2000.  Awards and Achievements  * Received the Governor General's Commemorative Medal * Received the YMCA Women of Distinction Award for Entrepreneurship (1993) * Received the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews Award (1995) * Received the Harry Jerome Award for Achievement in Business. * Co-chair of Toronto‚Äôs fundraising campaign for the James Robinson Johnston Chair in Black Canadian Studies at Dalhousie University * Vice-president of the Canadian Club of Toronto * Trustee for the Harry Jerome Scholarship fund * Director of the Ontario Science Centre In 1999 Beverly Mascoll was granted an honorary Doctor of Laws from Ryerson University. The Beverly Mascoll Award is a scholarship for black female students at the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University. Eldon Mascoll presented the inaugural award, named after his late mother, on March 4, 2019. Beverly Mascoll died from complications due to breast cancer in 2001, aged 59.

After his return to Bulgaria Kanchev started working on a farm near Rousse, but did not give up on his revolutionary ideas. He was appointed deputy of Vasil Levski by the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. In August 1871 Kanchev met with Levski in Lovech and was ordered to start agitating among the people of Northern Bulgaria so that they prepare for a future rebellion. For a relatively short period of time the young revolutionary performed important tasks. However, after an unsuccessful attempt to enter Romania on 5 March 1872, he killed himself to avoid capture by the Ottomans. His last words are: \\"Long live BULGARIA\\".

History Original St. Vincent Hospital building in Portland, 1910. Dedicated on July 19, 1875, it was the state's first permanent hospital, founded in the Northwest district of Portland, Oregon, by the Sisters of Providence, a Roman Catholic sisterhood from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In January 1971, the original campus in northwest Portland was closed and the current facility opened in Washington County. On January 31, 1971, the hospital used in-part large military buses capable of carrying 18 stretchers at a time to transport patients to the new hospital building. The facility at that time had a single, 13-story tower that consisted of seven floors of patient rooms. The new building had 400 hospital beds, while the old hospital had 420 beds. =Post-millennium= In 2004, the hospital was one of three in Oregon named by Solucient as a top 100 hospital in the United States.‚ÄúBusiness Briefs: Providence Milwaukie listed as a top hospital‚Äù, The Oregonian, June 3, 2004, South Zoner, p. 2.

In October 2015, work began on a four-year, $85 million remodeling of the nine-story main hospital building, which was built in 1971. Along with seismic retrofitting and modest expansion, the project will add a new aluminum exterior over the building's existing exposed-concrete surface, greatly changing its appearance when completed. Programs and institutes St. Vincent has specialized programs including Providence Heart and Vascular Institute, Oregon Medical Laser Center, Providence Multiple Sclerosis Center, and Providence Stroke Center. The hospital is licensed for 523 beds, and has over 3,500 employees. There are approximately 1,647 medical staff.

Personal life  He is the youngest of the famous five Sidek brothers. Rashid and his siblings gained exposure to badminton from their father, Mohd Sidek. Under the guidance of his father, Rashid and the rest of his siblings were trained to be champions. Rashid Sidek is an alumnus of Victoria Institution of batch 1981‚Äì1985.  Career  After completing his Sijil Penilaian Menengah (SPM) exam, he was injected into the Project 1988/90 squad with the aim to regain the Thomas Cup. In the 1990 Thomas Cup, Rashid had a strong tournament but Malaysia lost the finals to China 1‚Äì4. He won the Malaysian Open title for three consecutive years in 1990, 1991, and 1992. As a result, he became known by many as ‚Äújaguh kampung‚Äù (literally, \\"local hero\\"). In the Thomas Cup final in 1992, he beat Ardy Wiranata to give Malaysia the first point in a dramatic 3-2 win over rivals Indonesia - the first championship won by Malaysia in 25 years, and the last to this day. Rashid's performance declined in the next three years, but he bounced back in 1996, when he won the Asia Cup and German Open, then reached the finals of the All England before losing to Paul-Erik Hoyer Larsen from Denmark. His ranking rose to among the top three in the world. He won the bronze medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, beating the top seed, Joko Suprianto of Indonesia en route to the semi-finals, where he was beaten by Dong Jiong. However, he beat Indonesia's 1995 world champion, Heryanto Arbi, 5-15, 15-11, 15-6 in the third place playoff. In 1997, Rashid reached the top of the world ranking. He began to make room for players like Wong Choong Hann, Yong Hock Kin and Roslin Hashim to rise up, and retired in 2000.  Coaching  Upon his retirement, Rashid was appointed as national coach by the Badminton Association of Malaysia from 2003 until 2015. He became the instrumental to the success of the new generation badminton players such as Daren Liew and Chong Wei Feng. Apart from that, he was a coach in Nusa Mahsuri, the first professional badminton club in Malaysia from 1996 to 2002. Currently, he acts as the advisor for the club which he has set up with his brother, Jalani.

It is the fifth-largest island of the Croatian coast, and the one with the longest coastline. In the 2011 census, the population of the island was 9,059. There are two towns on the island, Pag and Novalja, as well as many smaller villages and tourist places. Pag is the only Croatian island that is administratively divided between two counties. Its northern part belongs to Lika-Senj County, while the central and southern parts belong to Zadar County. Geography Satellite image of Pag Caska on Pag Pag belongs to the north Dalmatian archipelago and it extends northwest-southeast along the coast, forming the Velebit channel. The island has an area of and the coastline is . It is around long (from northwest to southeast), and between wide. The southwestern coast of the island is low (including the Pag Bay with the large Caska cove), and the northwestern is steep and high (including Stara Novalja Bay). Most of the island is rocky; smaller areas are covered with Mediterranean shrubs. The southeast of the island contains karst lakes Velo Blato and Malo Blato. The island's highest peak, at , is Sveti Vid (St Vitus). Grapes, vegetables and fruit are grown in the valleys and fields. The northern area of the Lun peninsula is mostly under olive groves. Most communities on the island are connected by a road. A -long arch Pag Bridge connects the southern part of the island to the mainland. The Prizna‚Äì≈Ωigljen ferry connects the northern part of the island to the mainland. The island has two towns, Pag and Novalja, and many smaller villages and communities, including Lun, Stara Novalja, Gajac, Kolan, Metajna, Dinji≈°ka, Povljana and others. The island is divided between two counties, with Novalja, Stara Novalja, Lun and Metajna being part of the northern Lika-Senj County, and the remainder of the island south of an isthmus at Gajac, including the town of Pag, being part of the southern Zadar County. History The earliest settlers on the island were an Illyrian tribe that came to the region in the Bronze Age; traces of their settlement can still be seen around Pag. In the 1st century BC, the Romans took possession, and have left numerous archeological and cultural artifacts. The Croats arrived in the 7th century along with the great migration and settled in the area. The island was for some time under the rule of the Croatian kingdom. Yet the island was always fought over, and in the 11th and 12th centuries was divided between the communities of Rab (Arbe) and of Zadar (Zara). From the 12th to 14th centuries, Pag, along with other Dalmatian islands and towns, was fiercely contested between the Republic of Venice and the Croatian-Hungarian rulers. For four centuries from the start of the 15th century, it was held by Venice, until Venice lost its independence in 1797. Austria and France then fought over Dalmatia with victory going to the Austrians. The island passed from Austria-Hungary to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I, and then to the Independent State of Croatia (1941‚Äì45), when the Ustashe set up concentration camps at Slana and Metajna, where they killed thousands of Serbs, Jews and Croatian anti-fascists. After the Second World War it returned to Yugoslavia and, after the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991, the island became part of the Republic of Croatia. Economy The first Croatian wind farm was constructed on Pag island, just northeast of Pag town. The 5.95 MW \\"Vjetroelektrana Ravna 1\\" wind farm is composed of seven Vestas V52 wind turbines and has operated since 2004. Throughout its history, Pag has been connected with salt production, a traditional activity that has been practiced for more than a thousand years. While the earliest historical records of salt production on the island date to 999, it is believed salt was produced on Pag in Roman times. The origin of the town of Pag is connected with the exploitation of natural suitably shallow coves within the closed bay (the so-called Valle di Pago) for salt manufacturing.

Such courses may be general, covering the most common issues parents may encounter, or specific, for infants, toddlers, children and teenagers. These courses may also be geared towards parents who are considering having a child, or adopting one, or are pregnant. Some parent education programs are: * Parent Effectiveness Training is based on person- centered psychotherapy. * Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (STEP) is based on individual psychology.  Development  Parenting education and support has always existed (e.g. through informal kinship and family networks), but formal recognition of the need to support parents was established through the International Year of the Family in 1994.UNESCO, 1995. International Year of the Family: Final Report and Calendar of Events. In understanding the history of parenting programmes, it is necessary to highlight two global shifts. The first relates to significant changes in family structure, where extended, tribal or community family models have given way to more nuclear ‚Äì and, in some societies, absent-parent ‚Äì family models (e.g. due to conflict, disease and natural disasters). The second shift involves demands on families due to societal changes in areas including employment, inequity in incomes, exposure to disease and modern influences such as drug use, technology and urbanization. These changes have made clear the need for support for parents or their surrogates. As traditional structures dissipate and new parenting challenges arise, concerted efforts are required to assist parents in fulfilling their role.  Landscape of parenting programs  There are two broad categories of parenting programmes. Parent education and support programmes not only include services that help parents in their role but may also include information on other aspects (e.g. job training or adult literacy). Parenting support programmes are those that are focused primarily on parenting. These two types are differentiated because of their implications for policy and establishing appropriate entry points for service provision. For example, social protection, health care and cash transfer programmes could provide an entry point for parent education and support programmes. The landscape of parenting programmes is quite complex and can be differentiated on several dimensions that have been associated with child outcomes. The variety and complexity of these services and challenges in the identification of effective parenting models are highlighted below. Some programmes are intended to improve parents‚Äô knowledge and practices related to caregiving, nutrition and child health,Aboud, F. and Akhter, S. 2011. A cluster-randomized evaluation of a responsive stimulation and feeding intervention in Bangladesh. Pediatrics, 127, e1191-e1197. while others focus on early education and learning.Kagitcibasi, C., Sunar, D. and Bekman, S. 2001. Long-term effects of early intervention: Turkish low-income mothers and children. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 22, pp. 333-361. There are also programmes centred around the reduction of harsh parenting and violence at home,Al-Hassan, S. M. and Lansford, J. E. 2011. Evaluation of the better parenting programme in Jordan. Early Child Development and Care, 181(5), pp. 587-598. and a range of programmes that have more comprehensive or integrated designs, for example, the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) ‚Äì Care for Development.World Health Organization. 2012. Care for Development: Improving the Care of Young Children. Geneva, WHO. There is also a set of programmes in which parenting, although addressed, is not the primary focus (e.g. social protection, cash transfer programmes or adult literacy programmes). Programmes can also be differentiated by the number of generations who are the target beneficiaries. Single-generation programmes are designed to directly serve mothers (e.g. breastfeeding programmes) and/or fathers,Cowan, C. P., Cowan, P. A., Pruett, M. K. and Pruett, K. 2007. An approach to preventing co- parenting conflict and divorce in low-income families: Strengthening couple relationships and fostering fathers‚Äô involvement. Family Process, 46(1), pp. 109-121. while multi-generational programmes either serve the parent and the child or the entire family.Wasik, B. H. (ed.) 2012. Handbook of Family Literacy. Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Programmes may also differ in their targeted stage of development. Some focus on parents with children from birth to 3 years old (Hamadani et al., 2006),Hamadani, J. D., et al. 2006. Psychosocial stimulation improves the development of undernourished children in rural Bangladesh. Journal of Nutrition, 136, pp. 2645-2652. but others are designed for parents with children from 3 upwards.Johnson, U. Y., Martinez-Cantu, V., Jacobson, A. L. and Weir, C.

Typically, programmes that focus on the younger age group have a health, nutrition and/or stimulation focus and those for older children have a social, learning and education focus. Programmes also differ based on setting. Some are home-based,Mother Child Education Foundation. 2012. Mother Child Education Program Introduction.

The type of service provider involved in a programme is also a differentiating dimension. Professional service providers include nurses and trained parent educators.Olds, D. 2011. Evidentiary Foundations of Nurse-Family Partnership. Nurse-Family Partnership http://www.nursefamilypartnership.org/about/ program- history However, given issues of low technical capacity and limited resources, most programmes use paraprofessionals or community workers.Daro, D. and Dodge, K. A. 2010. Strengthening home-visiting intervention policy: Expanding reach, building knowledge. In Haskins, R. and Barnett, W. S. (eds). New Directions for America‚Äôs Preschool Policies. Washington, DC, Center on Children and Families - National Institute for Early Education Research Policy Briefs, Brookings Institution. Depending on the type of programme, the credentials and training of the service provider and supervision practices are critical to improving its quality. Another differentiating dimension is the manner in which services are delivered. Some parenting programmes involve a one-to-one teaching or counselling model,Powell, C. 2004. An Evaluation of the Roving Caregivers Programme of the Rural Family Support Organization. Jamaica, UNICEF. while others use a group discussion format.Ko√ßak, A. 2004. Evaluation Report of the Father-Support Program. Istanbul, Mother-Child Education Foundation Publications. They may use one or multiple delivery mechanisms. For example, a very common combination is home-based services and media in the form of posters and brochures or radio announcements.Britto, P. R., Engle, P. and Alderman, H. 2007. Early intervention and caregiving: Evidence from the Uganda nutrition and child development program. Child Health Education, 1(2), pp. 112-133. Programmes can also be differentiated by the degree of standardization within their curriculum. Some follow a very structured curriculum with weekly lessons plans and a detailed script for the service providers, while others are less formal with topics generated based on participant needs and interests. Finally, programmes can be distinguished from one another based on the critical dimension of ‚Äòdose‚Äô which includes the length of the programme from inception to culmination, the periodicity (e.g. daily or weekly) and the length of each session. Programme dosage is important for understanding effectiveness and resource requirements. Also, it has been noted that as programmes get scaled up the dosage is often altered. This complex landscape of parenting programmes is represented across programmatic models as either single site or demonstration interventions or national programmes supported by specific sectors, such as health, education, women‚Äôs affairs or welfare.  Kess-erziehen  Alfred Adlers individual psychology and the work of Rudolf Dreikurs are the scientific foundation of kess- erziehen. In German \\"Kess\\" means breezy or perky. The abbreviation refers to cooperative, encouraging, social and situation-oriented. The goal of the course is to promote a cooperative, democratic educational style through common rules for family life and consensus that is reached in a family council. The course promotes the ability of the participants to understand the social needs of children, the disregard of which can lead to undesirable behaviors. Adults and children are seen as equal and the mutual approval of needs is emphasized. Parents and educators learn to develop cooperation, conflict management and to set borders through logical consequences. Consistent, encouraging action is used to promote independence and to allow children to accept responsibility for their own actions. The participants are guided to act situation-oriented, to offer choices to children and to notice positive behaviors, instead of reacting primarily to undesirable behaviors. Thereby self-esteem and responsible action in partnership are promoted.  Starke Eltern - Starke Kinder  Starke Eltern ‚Äì Starke Kinder is the parent education course of the German Child Protection Alliance (DKSB). The program is based on humanistic psychology. The target audience of the program are all parents but adaption to more specific target audiences, as for instance single parents, stepfamilies, certain age groups or educators is possible. The course uses a model of guided education, which allows the parents to try out what they learned at home. The participants are guided to improve the communication between parents and child, to strengthen the self-esteem of the child, to reflect on educational goals and to recognize and solve problems.  Summary of findings from parenting programs  Findings from a recently published review of eleven effectiveness trials and four scaled-up parenting programmes reflect a range in delivery settings, generation of target beneficiaries, curricula and key messages.Engle, P. L., Fernald, L. C., Alderman, H., Behrman, J., O‚ÄôGara, C., Yousafzai, A., de Mello, M.C., Hidrobo, M., Ulkuer, N., Ertem I., Iltus S., and e Global Child Development Steering Group. 2011. Strategies for reducing inequalities and improving developmental outcomes for young children in low-income and middle-income countries. The Lancet, 378(9799), pp. 1339-1353. All programmes report substantial positive outcomes for children (e.g. cognitive, social and emotional development) and two of the programmes report significant improvements in adult parenting knowledge and the home environment. There are also some interesting patterns to the results that have important implications for future programme design. First, the findings suggest that programmes that employ more than one delivery mechanism are more effective than those that rely on a single mechanism, and programmes that address the parent and child (i.e. two-generation programmes) are more effective than those that only focus on the parent. The effects of the evaluated programmes were also stronger among younger children; this result demonstrates support for the hypothesis that earlier intervention yields better outcomes. Also, results were stronger for poorer children when compared with their wealthier peers; this finding validates previous work on programmes impact and disadvantage. A 2016 Cochrane systematic review of group-based parent training programs for improving emotional and behavioral adjustment in young children found tentative support for their short term effectiveness. Finally, some interventions improve parenting practices even when their primary focus is not parenting. For instance, social protection conditional cash transfer programmes that combine cash and parenting services have demonstrable impact on parenting knowledge and practice.Behrman, J. R. and Hoddinott, J. 2005. Programme evaluation with unobserved heterogeneity and selective implementation: The Mexican PROGRESA impact on child nutrition. Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 67, pp. 547-569.Macours, K., Schady, N. and Vakis, R. 2012. Cash transfer, behavioral changes and cognitive development in early childhood: evidence from a randomized experiment. Applied Economics, 4, pp. 247-272. These evaluations, predominantly from Latin America, are important because they address parenting directly through support and education but also indirectly by altering a family‚Äôs poverty status ‚Äì a contextual influence on parenting. Adult and family literacy programmes have also demonstrated a positive impact on parent and child outcomes.Padak, N. and Rasinski, T. 2003. Family Literacy Programs: Who Benefits? Kent, OH, Ohio Literacy Resource Center, Kent State University. These results are not unexpected given the established link between maternal education and child health and development outcomes. In summary, parenting programmes exist within a complex landscape and represent a myriad of designs, making it difficult to isolate and compare effective mechanisms. In addition, the strong influence of context is important in the interpretation of results. In general, these programmes have been effective in improving parenting practices, knowledge and attitudes and in supporting children‚Äôs positive health, growth, development, learning and protection.  Broadening the focus to include families  It has been speculated that ‚Äòparenting‚Äô is an academic term to represent the reality, which is ‚Äòfamilies‚Äô. The suggested shift in approach from parenting to family might be useful in increasing the impact of the interventions. This recommendation stems not only from the shifting definition of who is a parent because of health, demographic and economic changes in society, but also the recognition that the immediate context of a young child consists of several key individuals who constitute a family. Also, ‚Äòfamily‚Äô as an institution is recognized across sectors, and, particularly in times of conflict and disaster, is often the only institution that is able to support the child. UNESCO‚Äôs report contained an important set of approaches that resonate even today, for example with respect to the Millennium Development Goals.Roylance, S. (ed.) 2012. The Family and the MDGs: Using Family Capital to Achieve the 8 Millennium Development Goals. Doha, Doha Family Institute. The shift will allow for multiple sectors to provide a coordinated focus on the institution of ‚Äòfamily‚Äô in a cohesive manner. Family intervention programmes, although primarily from high-income countries, have been very effective in improving well-being in a service and cost-effective manner.

In professional wrestling, a battle royal (sometimes battle royale; plural battles royal or battle royals) is a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner. Typical battle royals begin with a number of participants in the ring, who are then eliminated by going over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor. Variations =Battlebowl= A two-ring variation on a battle royal, the wrestlers start in one ring and try to throw wrestlers into the second ring, after which they can be eliminated by being thrown out of that ring. The last remaining wrestler in the first ring can rest until only one wrestler is left in the second ring, after which they fight in both rings until one is eliminated and a winner is declared, in similar fashion to a double elimination tournament. This was held by World Championship Wrestling at the 1991 Starrcade event, but future Battlebowl matches were contested under normal battle royal rules. =Battle Zone= Any number of men: One ring- Over the top rope elimination. Typical battle royal, except this one features tables covered with barbed wire, thumbtacks, and light bulbs on the outside of the ring, which may catch wrestlers as they are thrown out of the ring. =Bunkhouse Stampede= The National Wrestling Alliance's (NWA) Bunkhouse Stampede involved wrestlers wearing what was described as \\"bunkhouse gear\\"-- cowboy boots, jeans, T-shirts--instead of their normal wrestling tights and not only allowed but encouraged the bringing of weapons. In 1988 the NWA named a pay-per-view after the Bunkhouse Stampede, headlined by a Bunkhouse Stampede match held inside a cage. =Dynamite Dozen Battle Royale= The Dynamite Dozen Battle Royale is used by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). The match features twelve wrestlers fighting in a standard battle royal, with the final two competitors remaining in the ring going on to face each other at a later date in order to win a special prize. Only one such match type has taken place so far, which was on the November 20, 2019 episode of AEW Dynamite. Adam Page and MJF were the final two combatants; MJF would defeat Page on the following week's episode of Dynamite and was awarded the \\"AEW Dynamite Diamond Ring\\". =Fulfill Your Fantasy battle royal= A WWE women's battle royal with the addition of fetish outfits, such as french maid, lingerie, nurse, schoolgirl, etc. Often the type of outfit is chosen by an audience poll. =Hardcore battle royal= A battle royal with hardcore rules (no disqualifications and no count-outs) involving several competitors in the ring at the same time. The match could last for either 15 or 20 minutes. All participants are not eliminated by being thrown out of the ring and both feet touching the floor. Pinning or forcing to submit whomever was current Hardcore champion would result in the victorious participant becoming the interim champion. Whoever the person held the title at end of the time limit would be declared the winner of the match and the official champion. =Last Blood battle royal= A Last Blood battle royal is essentially a multi-competitor First Blood match. The winner is the last wrestler in the match not bleeding.Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.192-194) =Reverse battle royal= Generally used in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, a reverse battle royal begins with wrestlers surrounding the ring instead of inside it. At the start of the match they battle for half of them to get into the ring, at which point a standard last person standing wins the battle royal. =Thunderbowl= A variation of Battlebowl involves 100 wrestlers split into 50 in two rings. The only way to be eliminated is to be thrown over the ropes. No matter how and where you hit, whether its apron, floor or barricade you are also eliminated. When 25 wrestlers are left in each ring stage 2 begins. This 2nd stage is when all 50 wrestlers get into one ring and there is no elimination. After a 5-minute period, the match turns into a Battle Royal where elimination is gained by throwing your opponent over the ropes and to the floor. When 5 wrestlers remain stage 3 begins. This 3rd stage then turns into a 5-Way match where pinfall and submission will eliminate an opponent. When 2 wrestlers are left, the match turns into a last man standing where KO is legal. =TNA Knockout Makeover Battle Royal= Match will begin as the multi-women over- the-top elimination battle royal. They are eliminated from the match if they are thrown over the top rope and both feet land on the floor, until the final two competitors are left. The final two competitors will face each other in a ladder match, where the winner will receive a TNA Knockout Championship match, while the runner-up will have her head shaved. =Women's battle royal= A women's battle royal is one which features female competitors. This variant may allow women to be eliminated by being thrown through or under the ropes as well as over the top rope, although WWE's first official women's Royal Rumble match in 2018 used the same rules as the men's version. =World War 3= Created by World Championship Wrestling in 1995, the World War 3 battle royal involved a three-ring setup and 60 competitors. 20 wrestlers started in each of the 3 rings in which they would wrestle under regular battle royal rules. Once there were 30 competitors remaining (except in 1997, where the number was 20), all competitors would enter the center ring and continue under regular rules until only one wrestler was left standing. Rumble rules battle royals In this version ‚Äì unlike traditional battle royals where all the wrestlers begin the match in the ring ‚Äì the competitors (after numbers 1 and 2 begin the match) enter at timed intervals in accordance with the number that they have drawn until the entire field has entered. =Royal Rumble= 2010 Royal Rumble match WWE's Royal Rumble is the original battle royal to use this format. It begins with two wrestlers in the ring, with the remaining participants introduced one by one at a set time period, usually 90 seconds or two minutes. Elimination occurs in the normal way with the last person standing as the winner, after all participants (traditionally 30) have entered the ring. There is both a men's and women's Royal Rumble match, with the winners getting a world championship match (in their respective divisions) at that year's WrestleMania, which is WWE's biggest annual show. At the Greatest Royal Rumble in 2018, 50 participants entered the match. =Honor Rumble= Ring of Honor (ROH) also periodically features the \\"Rumble\\" style of battle royal on their shows, billing it as the Honor Rumble. =New Japan Rumble= New Japan Pro-Wrestling's annual \\"Rumble\\" battle royal, takes place on the pre-show of Wrestle Kingdom on January 4. Participants enter at one minute intervals and are eliminated via pinfall, submission or by being thrown over the top rope. Typically leaning towards light comedy, the match includes past stars as surprise entrants. =Gauntlet for the Gold= Gauntlet for the Gold is the \\"Rumble\\" style battle royal used by Impact Wrestling. In this version two wrestlers begin in the ring, with additional wrestlers entering on a set time period. Wrestlers are eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and to the floor until two wrestlers are left, at which point a standard singles match begins. = Square Go! = Square Go! is Insane Championship Wrestling's (ICW) very own hybrid of WWE's Royal Rumble and Money in the Bank matches, and named for the Glaswegian term for a street fight. The competitors will compete in a 30-man over-the-top-rope battle royal, the Square Go!, with the winner earning the Square Go Briefcase. It has mostly the same rules apply as Royal Rumble, two competitors who draw the numbers 1 and 2. The remaining participants which will enter the ring one-by-one at every 2 minute intervals. 5 people have drawn entry numbers that allow them to carry a weapon of their choice into the ring. Participants were eliminated when thrown over the top ropes with both feet landing on the floor. The winner will win a briefcase that will entitle him to a match for the ICW World Championship at any time and anywhere of their choosing for 1 year (similar to Money in the Bank). =Battle Riot= Major League Wrestling's \\"Rumble\\" style battle royal. Participants enter at one minute intervals and are eliminated via pinfall, submission or by being thrown over the top rope. = Aztec Warfare = Aztec Warfare is the Lucha Underground version of the \\"Rumble Rules\\" battle royal. Upwards to 20 participants enter every 90 seconds and elimination occurs by either pinfall or submission and has to take place inside the ring. There are no count-outs and no disqualifications. As of April 2019, four Aztec Warfare matches have occurred‚Äîone in each season of Lucha Underground. =Casino Battle Royale= The Casino Battle Royale is utilized by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It is a modified rumble rules battle royal that features 21 entrants. It begins with a group of five wrestlers, and every three minutes, another group of five wrestlers enter, while the 21st and final entrant enters alone. The wrestlers are grouped based on the suit they drew from a deck of cards ‚Äì spades, diamonds, clubs, or hearts ‚Äì and the order of when each group enters is based on a random draw of the cards. The 21st and final entrant is the wrestler who drew the joker. The winner receives a world championship match of their respective gender's division‚Äîeither the AEW World Championship or the AEW Women's World Championship. The first Casino Battle Royale occurred during the pre-show of AEW's inaugural event, Double or Nothing in 2019, and was a men's match. The winner of the inaugural match was entered into the match to determine the inaugural AEW World Champion at All Out that year. The second Casino Battle Royale was an all-female version and was held during the pre- show of the aforementioned All Out event. Like the first, the winner of this second iteration was entered into the match to determine the inaugural AEW Women's World Champion on the debut episode of AEW's weekly television show, Dynamite. The third Casino Battle Royale‚Äîa men's match‚Äîtook place at All Out in 2020 and the winner received a future AEW World Championship match. Team variations Team variations of battle royals consist of designated tag teams of wrestlers, usually two to a team. There are different types of such matches, and though most follow normal battle royal rules, teams may be eliminated when either one or both partners are eliminated from the ring. One notable version was the battle royal prior to WrestleMania XV, where each wrestler fought as a singles competitor, with the final two in the ring named joint winners, earning the right to challenge for the promotion's tag team championship later that night.

With sufficient pressure, inherited traits that mitigate its effects‚Äîeven if they would be deleterious in other circumstances‚Äîcan become widely spread through a population. It is a quantitative description of the amount of change occurring in processes investigated by evolutionary biology, but the formal concept is often extended to other areas of research. In population genetics, selection pressure is usually expressed as a selection coefficient.  Amino acids selective pressure  It has been shown that putting an amino acid bio-synthesizing gene like HIS4 gene under amino acid selective pressure in yeast causes enhancement of expression of adjacent genes which is due to the transcriptional co- regulation of two adjacent genes in Eukaryota.  Antibiotic resistance  Drug resistance in bacteria is an example of an outcome of natural selection. When a drug is used on a species of bacteria, those that cannot resist die and do not produce offspring, while those that survive potentially pass on the resistance gene to the next generation (vertical gene transmission). The resistance gene can also be passed on to one bacterium by another of a different species (horizontal gene transmission). Because of this, the drug resistance increases over generations. For example, in hospitals, environments are created where pathogens such as C. difficile have developed a resistance to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is made worse by the misuse of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is encouraged when antibiotics are used to treat non-bacterial diseases, and when antibiotics are not used for the prescribed amount of time or in the prescribed dose. Antibiotic resistance may arise out of standing genetic variation in a population or de novo mutations in the population. Either pathway could lead to antibiotic resistance, which may be a form of evolutionary rescue. =Nosocomial infections= Clostridium difficile, gram-positive bacteria species that inhabits the gut of mammals, exemplifies one type of bacteria that is a major cause of death by nosocomial infections. When symbiotic gut flora populations are disrupted (e.g., by antibiotics), one becomes more vulnerable to pathogens. The rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance places an enormous selective pressure on the advantageous alleles of resistance passed down to future generations. The Red Queen hypothesis shows that the evolutionary arms race between pathogenic bacteria and humans is a constant battle for evolutionary advantages in outcompeting each other. The evolutionary arms race between the rapidly evolving virulence factors of the bacteria and the treatment practices of modern medicine requires evolutionary biologists to understand the mechanisms of resistance in these pathogenic bacteria, especially considering the growing number of infected hospitalized patients. The evolved virulence factors pose a threat to patients in hospitals, who are immunocompromised from illness or antibiotic treatment. Virulence factors are the characteristics that the evolved bacteria have developed to increase pathogenicity. One of the virulence factors of C. difficile that largely constitutes its resistance to antibiotics is its toxins: enterotoxin TcdA and cytotoxin TcdB. Toxins produce spores that are difficult to inactivate and remove from the environment. This is especially true in hospitals where an infected patient's room may contain spores for up to 20 weeks. Combating the threat of the rapid spread of CDIs is therefore dependent on hospital sanitation practices removing spores from the environment. A study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology found that to control the spread of CDIs glove use, hand hygiene, disposable thermometers and disinfection of the environment are necessary practices in health facilities. The virulence of this pathogen is remarkable and may take a radical change at sanitation approaches used in hospitals to control CDI outbreaks.  Natural selection in humans  The Malaria parasite can exert a selective pressure on populations. This pressure has led to natural selection for erythrocytes carrying the sickle cell hemoglobin gene mutation (Hb S)‚Äîcausing sickle cell anaemia‚Äîin areas where malaria is a major health concern, because the condition grants some resistance to this infectious disease.  Resistance to herbicides and pesticides  Just as with the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, resistance to pesticides and herbicides has begun to appear with commonly used agricultural chemicals. For example: * In the US, studies have shown that fruit flies that infest orange groves were becoming resistant to malathion, a pesticide used to kill them. * In Hawaii and Japan, the diamondback moth developed a resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis, which is used in several commercial crops including Bt corn, about three years after it began to be used heavily. * In England, rats in certain areas have developed such a strong resistance to rat poison that they can consume up to five times as much of it as normal rats without dying. * DDT is no longer effective in controlling mosquitoes that transmit malaria in some places, a fact that contributed to a resurgence of the disease. * In the southern United States, the weed Amaranthus palmeri, which interferes with production of cotton, has developed widespread resistance to the herbicide glyphosate. * In the Baltic Sea, decreases in salinity has encouraged the emergence of a new species of brown seaweed, Fucus radicans.  Humans exerting evolutionary pressure  Human activity can lead to unintended changes in the environment. The human activity will have a possible negative effect on a certain population, causing many individuals from said population to die due to not being adapted to this new pressure. The individuals that are better adapted to this new pressure will survive and reproduce at a higher rate than those who are at a disadvantage. This occurs over many generations until the population as a whole is better adapted to the pressure. This is natural selection at work, but the pressure is coming from man-made activity such as building roads or hunting. This is seen in the below examples of cliff swallows and elk. However, not all human activity that causes an evolutionary pressure happens unintentionally. This is demonstrated in dog domestication and the subsequent selective breeding that resulted in the various breeds known today. = Rattlesnakes = In more heavily (human) populated and trafficked areas, reports have been increasing of rattlesnakes that do not rattle. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to selective pressure by humans, who often kill the snakes when they are discovered. Non-rattling snakes are more likely to go unnoticed, so survive to reproduce offspring that, like themselves, are less likely to rattle. = Cliff swallows = Populations of cliff swallows in Nebraska have displayed morphological changes in their wings after many years of living next to roads. Collecting data for over 30 years, researchers noticed a decline in wingspan of living swallow populations, while also noting a decrease in the number of cliff swallows killed by passing cars. Those cliff swallows that were killed by passing cars showed a larger wingspan than the population as a whole. Confounding effects such as road usage, car size, and population size were shown to have no impact on the study. = Elk = Evolutionary pressure imposed by humans is also seen in elk populations. These studies do not look at morphological differences, but behavioral differences. Faster and more mobile male elk were shown to be more likely to fall prey to hunters. The hunters create an environment where the more active animals are more likely to succumb to predation than less active animals. Female elk who survived past two years, would decrease their activity as each year passed, leaving more shy female elk that were more likely to survive. Female elk in a separate study also showed behavioral differences, with older females displaying the timid behavior that one would expect from this selection. = Dog domestication = Since the domestication of dogs, they have evolved alongside humans due to pressure from humans and the environment. This began by humans and wolves sharing the same area, with a pressure to coexist eventually leading to their domestication. Evolutionary pressure from humans led to many different breeds that paralleled the needs of the time, whether it was a need for protecting livestock or assisting in the hunt. Hunting and herding were a couple of the first reasons for humans artificially selecting for traits they deemed beneficial. This selective breeding does not stop there, but extends to humans selecting for certain traits deemed desirable in their domesticated dogs, such as size and color, even if they are not necessarily beneficial to the human in a tangible way. An unintended consequence of this selection is that domesticated dogs also tend to have heritable diseases depending on what specific breed they encompass.

Savino (born September 28, 1963) is a Democratic politician representing the 23rd Senate District in the New York State Senate, in northern Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn, including Sunset Park, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach, Brighton Beach, and Coney Island. From January 2011 to April 2018, Savino was a member of the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of eight Democratic state senators who formed a separate conference and allied themselves with Senate Republicans. Savino and her IDC colleagues rejoined the Senate Democratic Conference in April 2018. Savino was one of only two former members of the IDC that survived primary challenges in the 2018 New York Senate elections. Early life and career Savino was born in Astoria, Queens and went on to graduate from Dominican Commercial High School. She has a psychology degree from St. John's University as well as a degree in Industrial and Labor Relations from Cornell. Prior to elected office, Savino began her career in public service as a caseworker for New York City's Administration for Children's Services, providing direct assistance to abused and neglected children. She was an active member of her local labor union, the Social Service Employees Union, Local 371, DC 37 of AFSCME, and became the Vice President for Political Action & Legislative Affairs. State Senate career In 2004, Savino was elected to represent the 23rd Senatorial District. She succeeded longtime Senator Seymour P. Lachman, who had retired. On December 2, 2009, Savino voted for same sex marriage legislation, which failed to pass the Senate. Her speech on same-sex marriage became popular on the Internet. Subsequently, in 2011, the Marriage Equality Act passed the Senate and became law; Savino voted for this bill as well. In 2011, Savino‚Äîtogether with Democratic Sens. Jeffrey D. Klein, David J. Valesky, and David Carlucci‚Äîformed the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC). The IDC caucused separately from the other State Senate Democrats; eventually, in December 2012, the IDC entered into a power-sharing arrangement with Senate Republicans that has lasted ever since. When the Republican Conference won enough seats for outright control of the Senate in 2014, Savino and the rest of the IDC chose to remain aligned with them. As a member of the IDC, Savino was provided with a stipend, known as a \\"lulu\\", worth $13,500 per year that is designated by Legislative Law 5-1 for the Chair of the Senate Codes Committee. Senate Republicans named her Vice Chair of that committee, reserving the chairmanship for a Republican; in order to provide the stipend to Savino, payroll officials falsified state documents. In 2014, medical marijuana was legalized in New York; Savino was the lead sponsor of that legislation. Savino has also sponsored proposed legislation that would legalize physician-assisted suicide. Savino and her IDC colleagues rejoined the Senate Democratic Conference in April 2018. In the 2018 Democratic Primary, Savino defeated Jasmine Robinson, a legal secretary who had been endorsed by the progressive groups Citizen Action of New York and Our Revolution, by a 67-21% margin. Savino was one of only two former IDC members (along with David Carlucci) to win their primary races. In the 2018 general election, Savino defeated her Republican opponent, David Krainert, by a 69-28% margin. =Election results= * Savino was first elected to the State Senate in 2004 with 39,833 votes; her Republican opponent, Al Curtis, received 23,361 votes. * In 2008, Savino was re-elected with 46,386 votes.

Comandante 380, was a Nicaraguan who founded and commanded the Nicaraguan Contras. In this capacity, he became a central global figure in one of the most prominent conflicts of the Cold War. Berm√∫dez founded the largest Contra army in the war against Nicaragua's Sandinista coalition government of Marxists, students, businessmen, and church groups, which received minor support from the Soviet Union, much more from Cuba, and most democratic governments in Latin America such as Costa Rica and Venezuela. From 1979 until the end of the military conflict in 1990, Bermudez was the Contras' top military commander. In addition to being responsible for all of the Contras' military operations, Berm√∫dez ultimately helped manage the Contras' transition to an opposition political party in the early 1990s, after the second election in post-Somoza Nicaragua ended in defeat for the Sandinistas. The first election, held in 1984 with severe irregularities resulted in a victory for the FSLN and its candidate, Daniel Ortega; it was the rejection of this questionable outcome that led the Contras to continue their insurgency until Ortega and the FSLN had been ejected from office. On February 16, 1991, Bermudez was assassinated in Managua. Founding the Nicaraguan contras Berm√∫dez was born on December 11, 1932 in Le√≥n, Nicaragua, the son of a mechanical engineer and a domestic servant. After graduating from the military academy in 1952, he took a commission in the engineer corps of the Nicaraguan Guardia Nacional. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel under former Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza Debayle, and was serving as military attach√© to the United States at the time of the 1979 revolution in Nicaragua by the Sandinistas. Berm√∫dez moved almost immediately into armed opposition against the new government, ultimately becoming one of the most influential leaders in the armed opposition to the Sandinista government. Together with Ricardo Lau, he created the 15th of September Legion, the first armed opposition movement against the Sandinistas. In 1981, Berm√∫dez returned to Tegucigalpa, Honduras, from exile in Miami, United States. He would later become commander of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN), the primary Contra movement. During the Contra war, Berm√∫dez held the nom de guerre Comandante 380. =Role in prominent Cold War conflict= The Contras' guerrilla war against the Sandinista government became one of the most contentious and prominent Cold War conflicts, with the United States supporting the Contras through overt and covert military assistance, and the Soviet Union, Cuba, East Germany and other Eastern Bloc nations supporting the Sandinistas. Under the Reagan Doctrine, through which the U.S. believed it could drive the Soviet Union out of Central America and other regions around the world, the U.S. began supplying Berm√∫dez' Contras with arms and other support. Criticisms Assessments of Berm√∫dez's military and political leadership varied. His supporters believed that he provided stability among the fractious rebels, holding the FDN together while other Contra factions splintered. Critics, however, charged that he failed to provide strategic direction for the FDN's campaigns, and that he hampered the Contras' effectiveness by rewarding loyal cronies and ex-Guardsmen instead of the most able commanders. Discontent finally led to a council of field commanders ousting Berm√∫dez, as well as the purging of the Contras' predominantly Miami-based political leadership. Many of the members of the so-called Council were then suspects in his death, along with the Sandinista government. Critics of the Contras also alleged that Berm√∫dez was one of several figures who had been engaged in cocaine and other drug-running as a Contra commander. =Relations with U.S.= Berm√∫dez, however, was the key military leader behind the Contras' war. He also was a key contact for the Reagan administration, who saw him, along with Adolfo Calero, as their primary contacts within the Contra leadership. Votes on U.S. aid to the Contras were some of the most contentious and close votes in the United States Congress during the 1980s, but the predominant sentiment in Congress was that continued aid to the Contras was critical both to establishing a non-communist government in Nicaragua and driving the Soviet Union from the American hemisphere during the height of the Cold War. Autobiography: The Contras' Valley Forge In the Summer 1988 issue of Policy Review magazine, Berm√∫dez told the most comprehensive account of his life, a lengthy autobiographical essay titled \\"The Contras' Valley Forge: How I View the Nicaraguan Crisis\\", in which the Contra leader chronicled his life from his early career as a military attache to Somoza through the height of the conflict between the Contras and Sandinista government.\\"The Contras' Valley Forge: How I View the Nicaragua Crisis\\", by Enrique Bermudez (with Michael Johns), Policy Review magazine, Heritage Foundation, Summer 1988 In the article, Berm√∫dez staunchly criticized the Sandinistas for their alliances with the Soviet Union and Cuba and for betraying promises they made to establish a representative democracy. However, Berm√∫dez also issued some criticism at U.S. policy, writing that some Democrats, such as Jim Wright, then the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, were appeasing the Sandinista regime in ways that were inhibiting the Contras' in their effort to overthrow the Sandinista government. The article was authored by conservative author and writer (and then Policy Review editor) Michael Johns, who interviewed Berm√∫dez over a series of days in Tegucigalpa, Honduras in May and June 1988.\\"Shultz to Visit Central America on Faltering Talks\\", The New York Times, June 19, 1988\\"For the Record\\" The Washington Post, August 4, 1988 Assassinated in Managua Following the Sandinista defeat in the 1990 elections, Berm√∫dez returned to Managua, only to be gunned down on February 16, 1991 after being lured to a meeting at Managua's InterContinental Hotel. He was shot in the hotel's parking lot as he departed the hotel after those with whom he was meeting failed to show. In 1994, Berm√∫dez' daughter, Claudia Berm√∫dez, told The Miami Herald: \\"There were a lot of people who would have benefited from having my dad put away--the Sandinistas, the Chamorro government, the United States. My dad died with a lot of information.\\" Personal In the last years of the Contra War, Berm√∫dez had taken up reading the works of noted libertarian author Ayn Rand. While serving as commander of the semi-secret Contra headquarters on the Nicaragua-Honduras border code named \\"Aguacate\\" - Spanish for Avocado - he was known for taking solitary walks in the nearby jungle, taking photographs of intricate spiderwebs. The Fort Scott Tribune - Oct 17, 1986 Plane's Crash Revives Contra Support Debate Berm√∫dez is survived by family members, most of whom live in Miami. He was buried in Miami, following a funeral mass that was attended by many of his U.S. and Nicaraguan supporters. In 2002 and 2004, his daughter, Claudia Berm√∫dez, now a resident of the San Francisco area, ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Democrat Barbara Lee for California's 9th congressional district seat. She remains heavily engaged in public policy-related initiatives in the district.

He studied lithography at the Institut Saint-Luc in Tournai, but upon leaving school found that there no jobs available for lithographers.Interview on fan site Last accessed 29 September 2006 He started working at Dupuis in 1960 as a cameraman for the small animation studio the publishing house had started, working on early Smurfs cartoons and other short movies. After a few years, he started writing comics and has since become one of the most prolific Franco-Belgian comics authors, almost always staying true to Dupuis and the weekly Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou. Some of his earliest work was for artists like Claire Bret√©cher, Gennaux and Eddy Ryssack. When Lucky Luke, the successful, long- running Western series, moved from Spirou to rival magazine Pilote magazine, Cauvin came up with Les Tuniques Bleues (French for \\"Blue Coats\\") which is set among the U.S. Cavalry around the time of the American Civil War. It was at first drawn by Louis Salv√©rius who, upon his death, was replaced by Lambil, and has since become a major best-selling comic book series with more than 15 million albums sold. Cauvin added another success in 1972 with Sammy, about bodyguards in Chicago during the Prohibition era, drawn by Berck. A short stint on Spirou and Fantasio (drawn by Nic Broca) was not so successful. Cauvin continued to work for the animation studio as well, writing the scripts for the Musti, Tip and Tap and The Pili's cartoons by Ray Goossens. He has lived in Nivelles since 1991. By November 1999, he had published over 237 albums,Interview from November 1999 Last accessed 28 June 2006 selling over 45 million in total.ActuaBD Comics news Last accessed 29 September 2006 Themes Cauvin's work is almost always humoristic, but he produces both long stories (i.e. 44 pages) and short gags (between half a page and 6 pages). He started mainly with historical series: Les Tuniques Bleues uses the American Civil War as background, while Sammy plays in the time of Al Capone and Eliot Ness, and Les Mousquetaires describes the adventures of three musketeers in the 17th century. But with Agent 212 (French for \\"Officer 212\\"), featuring a rather stupid cop, he started to make his stories more contemporary, and in the 1980s he breached increasingly taboo subjects and introduced more critical views with themes like nursing and hospitals in Les Femmes en Blanc (\\"The Women in White\\") with Philippe Bercovici, Les Paparazzi or gravediggers in Pierre Tombal. Although best known for Les Tuniques Bleues, he and Lambil also worked on a comics series called Pauvre Lampil (\\"Poor Lampil\\"), a semi-autobiographical account of the trials and tribulations of a melancholic comic strip artist and his love-hate relationship with his scriptwriter, caricatures of Lambil and Cauvin themselves. In fact, aside from Lambil (whose name is changed to \\"Lampil\\"), other characters, including their colleagues in the comic book industry, are referred to by their real or pen- names: Cauvin himself, Fournier, Franquin etc. Cauvin has also taken up more fantastic themes like that of a love angel in Cupido or the hard life of a vulture falling in love with an owl in Les Voraces. Other more recent series include C√©dric, a domestic strip surrounding a pre-adolescent schoolboy, and Les Psy (\\"The Shrinks\\") about a psychiatrist whose patients' eccentricities often lead him to question his own sanity. A lot of Cauvin's characters are of the short-tempered sort, easily provoked and exploding in rage when things go wrong. He makes his scripts in the form of a rudimentary comic, suggesting a page lay-out,Image of a Cauvin scenario for Les Femmes en Blanc.

He designed more than 1,000 buildings in the state of Maine. Early life Stevens was the son of Maria Wingate and Leander Stevens, a cabinet maker and builder of fancy carriages. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but when he was two, his family moved to Portland, Maine.Stephen Abbott, John Calvin Stevens, the Early Years, Maine Home & Design 2007 Stevens wanted to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but lacked the money to attend. Instead, he apprenticed in the Portland office of architect Francis H. Fassett, who in 1880 made him a junior partner to open the firm's new Boston office. Another architect working in the same building was William Ralph Emerson, whose historicist aesthetic in the Queen Anne Style had a profound effect on Stevens. He married Martha Louise Waldron in 1877, and they had four children. Stevens opened his own office in Portland in 1884. =Career= In 1888 Stevens formed a partnership with Albert Winslow Cobb. Together they wrote the book Examples of American Domestic Architecture (1889), an early study of the Shingle Style. Cobb wrote the prose and Stevens provided the illustrations. The partnership was dissolved in 1891. Stevens' son, John Howard Stevens, became an architect and joined his father's firm in 1898. John became a full partner in 1904, and the firm was renamed Stevens Architects. His most- acclaimed early house ‚Äî the James Hopkins Smith house in Falmouth Foreside, Maine (1886) ‚Äî was featured in George William Sheldon's Artistic Country Seats (1886‚Äì87).George William Sheldon, Artistic Country Seats I (New York, 1886‚Äì87), pp. 177‚Äì80, plate 41. In The Shingle Style (1955), Vincent Scully described the Smith house as a \\"pi√®ce de r√©sistance\\" and a \\"masterpiece\\", \\"a more sweeping and coherent version of Stevens' own house\\". Sheldon also praised his \\"powerful alterations\\" to a summer hotel called the Poland Springs House.Vincent J. Scully Jr., The Shingle Style (Yale University Press, 1955), p. 118. Houses designed by Stevens can be found along the Maine coast, as well as in Portland (particularly the West End) and its suburbs. He also designed public libraries, municipal buildings, hotels, and churches, as well as nine buildings for the campus of Hebron Academy, including the Psi Upsilon Fraternity House on the Bowdoin College campus. In one of his rare commissions outside of Maine, he created a master plan for and designed a chapel and at least six barracks buildings at the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (Southern Branch) in Hampton, Virginia. =Other interests= Stevens was a landscape painter. He belonged to the Brushians, a Portland art group which went on weekend outings. He exhibited his work with the Boston Art Club, the Portland Society of Art, and elsewhere. His oil painting Delano Park, Cape Elizabeth (1904) is in the collection of Blaine House, the Maine governor's official residence.Friends of the Blaine House, Blainehouse.org He was an avid art collector. He donated Afternoon Fog by Winslow Homer to the L. D. M. Sweat Memorial Galleries, now part of the Portland Museum of Art.Portland Society of Art, Maine, American Art Directory, Vol. 11, R. R. Bowker, 1914 In 1889, Stevens was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.\\"John Calvin Stevens,\\" in Harrie B. Coe, Maine: A History, Volume 1 (Clearfield, 1928), p. 35.

In the classic version of the game, the player devoting the most resources to a battlefield wins that battlefield, and the gain (or payoff) is equal to the total number of battlefields won. Consider two players (Colonel Blotto and Enemy), two battlefields both of equal value, both players know each other's total level of resources prior to allocation, and they then must make a simultaneous allocation decision. It is often assumed Colonel Blotto is the more-resourced officer (his level of resource can be defined to be 1), and Enemy has a fraction of resources less than 1. The Nash equilibrium allocation strategies and payoffs depend on that resource level relationship. center The Colonel Blotto game was first proposed by √âmile BorelThe Theory of Play and Integral Equations with Skew Symmetric Kernels (1953 translation from the French paper \\"La th√©orie du jeu et les √©quations int√©grales √† noyau sym√©trique gauche\\") in 1921. The game was studied after the Second World War by scholars in Operation Research, and became a classic in game theory.Guillermo Owen, Game Theory, Academic Press (1968) Gross and Wagner's 1950A Continuous Colonel Blotto Game paper, from which the fictitious Colonel Blotto and Enemy get their name, provides some example Nash equilibrium. Macdonell and Mastronardi 2015 provide the first complete characterization of all Nash equilibria to the canonical simplest version of the Colonel Blotto game. This solution, which includes a graphical algorithm for characterizing all the Nash equilibrium strategies, includes previously unidentified Nash equilibrium strategies as well as helps identify what behaviors should never be expected by rational players. Nash equilibrium strategies in this version of the game are a set of bivariate probability distributions: distributions over a set of possible resource allocations for each player, often referred to as Mixed Nash Equilibria (such as can be found in Paper-Rock-Scissors or Matching Pennies as much simpler examples). Macdonell and Mastronardi 2015 solution, proof, and graphical algorithm for identifying Nash equilibria strategies also pertains to generalized versions of the game such as when Colonel Blotto have differing valuations of the battlefields, when their resources have differing effectiveness on the two battlefields (eg one battlefield includes a water landing and Colonel Blotto's resources are Marines instead of Soldiers), and provides insights into versions of the game with three or more battlefields. In addition to military strategy applications, the Colonel Blotto game has applications to political strategy (resource allocations across political battlefields), network defense, R&D; patent races, and strategic hiring decisions. Consider two sports teams with must spend budget caps (or two Economics departments with use-or-lose grants) are pursuing the same set of candidates, and must decide between many modest offers or aggressive pursuit of a subset of candidates. Example As an example Blotto game, consider the game in which two players each write down three positive integers in non-decreasing order and such that they add up to a pre-specified number S. Subsequently, the two players show each other their writings, and compare corresponding numbers. The player who has two numbers higher than the corresponding ones of the opponent wins the game. For S = 6 only three choices of numbers are possible: (2, 2, 2), (1, 2, 3) and (1, 1, 4). It is easy to see that: :Any triplet against itself is a draw :(1, 1, 4) against (1, 2, 3) is a draw :(1, 2, 3) against (2, 2, 2) is a draw :(2, 2, 2) beats (1, 1, 4) It follows that the optimum strategy is (2, 2, 2) as it does not do worse than breaking even against any other strategy while beating one other strategy. There are however several Nash equilibria. If both players choose the strategy (2, 2, 2) or (1, 2, 3), then none of them can beat the other one by changing strategies, so every such strategy pair is a Nash equilibrium. For larger S the game becomes progressively more difficult to analyze. For S = 12, it can be shown that (2, 4, 6) represents the optimal strategy, while for S > 12, deterministic strategies fail to be optimal. For S = 13, choosing (3, 5, 5), (3, 3, 7) and (1, 5, 7) with probability 1/3 each can be shown to be the optimal probabilistic strategy. Borel's game is similar to the above example for very large S, but the players are not limited to round integers. They thus have an infinite number of available pure strategies, indeed a continuum. This concept is also implemented in a story of Sun Bin when watching a chariot race with three different races running concurrently. In the races each party had the option to have one chariot team in each race, and each chose to use a strategy of 1, 2, 3 (with 3 being the fastest chariot and 1 being the slowest) to deploy their chariots between the three races creating close wins in each race and few sure outcomes on the winners. When asked how to win Sun Bin advised the chariot owner to change his deployment to that of 2, 3, 1. Though he would be sure to lose the race against the fastest chariots (the 3 chariots); he would win each of the other races, with his 3 chariot easily beating 2 chariots and his 2 chariot beating the 1 chariots. Application This game is commonly used as a metaphor for electoral competition, with two political parties devoting money or resources to attract the support of a fixed number of voters.R. Myerson \\"Incentives to cultivate favored minorities under alternative electoral systems\\" American Political Science Review 87(4):856‚Äî869, 1993 Each voter is a \\"battlefield\\" that can be won by one or the other party. The same game also finds application in auction theory where bidders must make simultaneous bids. Several variations on the original game have been solved by Jean-Fran√ßois Laslier,J.-F.

Perry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006), is a Supreme Court of the United States case in which the Court ruled that only District 23 of the 2003 Texas redistricting violated the Voting Rights Act.. The Court refused to throw out the entire plan, ruling that the plaintiffs failed to state a sufficient claim of partisan gerrymandering. The opinion requires lawmakers to adjust Congressional district boundaries in comport with the Court's ruling, though the ruling does not threaten Republican gains as a result of the redistricting in Texas. The Court also declined to resolve a dispute over whether partisan gerrymandering claims present nonjusticiable political questions. Background After the 2000 United States Census Democrats and Republicans in the Texas Legislature could not reach an agreement on redistricting and a new plan had to be drawn by a federal three- judge court made up of U.S. Circuit Judge Patrick Higginbotham, and U.S. District Judges John H. Hannah, Jr. and T. John Ward. When Tom DeLay and his Texans for a Republican Majority helped Republicans win total control of the state in the 2002 election, however, they sought to replace the court‚Äôs redistricting plan. Democratic lawmakers known as the Killer Ds and the Texas Eleven fled the state to deny the legislature of a quorum, but the clerk of the Texas House of Representatives issued arrest warrants for the legislators and DeLay had federal agencies track their movements. Governor Rick Perry called three special sessions and ultimately passed the new plan. Career staff at the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division advised the plan failed preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but were overruled by acting Assistant Attorney General Bradley Schlozman. At the November 2004 election, Republican seats increased from fifteen to twenty-one, with even Martin Frost, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, losing his seat. Private plaintiffs sued, alleging any mid-decade redistricting was illegal, the plan was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, and it was in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 243 (2006). On January 6, 2004, a three- judge district court now made up of Circuit Judge Higgenbotham, and District Judges Ward and Lee H. Rosenthal rejected all the plaintiffs‚Äô claims, with Judge Ward concurring in part and dissenting in part. On October 18, 2004, however, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case after its new plurality decision in Vieth v. Jubelirer readdressed the political question doctrine. On June 9, 2005, the three-judge court rejected all the plaintiffs‚Äô claims again, with Judge Ward writing a special concurrence. Plaintiffs appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, where two hours of argument were heard on March 1, 2006, with Paul M. Smith appearing for the statewide plaintiffs, Nina Perales of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund appearing for the District 23 plaintiffs, Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz appearing for the state, and then-Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Gregory G. Garre appearing as a friend of Texas. Supreme Court On June 28, 2006, the second to last day of the term, a highly fractured Court rejected all of the plaintiffs‚Äô claims except for the vote dilution claim in Texas's 23rd congressional district, producing six different opinions spanning 121 pages of the United States Reports. =Statewide claims= Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected plaintiff‚Äôs claim that the statewide plan was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Samuel Alito did not join that part of the opinion but concurred in the judgment, while noting that they were ‚Äútaking no position‚Äù on if political gerrymandering claims were even judicable. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Clarence Thomas, also concurred in the judgment but felt that the case should be dismissed because political gerrymandering claims are not justiciable. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Stephen Breyer, dissented, arguing that because the plan‚Äôs ‚Äúsole intent‚Äù was explicitly partisan, it violated the Equal Protection Clause and that Republicans had created ‚Äútheir own impermissible stranglehold on political power.‚Äù * The plaintiff's argument of this being a statewide unconstitutional partisan gerrymander was rejected 7-2. * The plaintiff's argument that states can redistrict only once per census under the federal constitution or acts of Congress was explicitly rejected. States can redistrict as often they please as long as they do it at least once every ten years. = Districts 23 & 25 = The Court, now of Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, Stevens and Breyer, applied Thornburg v. Gingles' (1986) to find vote dilution in District 23 in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. By a 5-4 vote the majority ruled that: * Old district 23 was a qualified protected majority-minority Latino district (indeed in 2002 on the verge of throwing out the incumbent that wasn't of their choice). * Although new district 23 still had an overall Latino majority, only 46% of new district 23's citizen voting- age population was Latino due to 100,000 Latinos being moved to neighboring district 28. Therefore, new district 23 was in no way, shape or form a qualifying majority-minority district. * New district 25 wasn't compact enough to be considered a qualifying replacement majority-minority Latino district. The two Latino communities within new district 25 were more than 300 miles apart, raising the appearance that the district was drawn to pick up as many Latinos as possible without regard to compactness. * And therefore new District 23 is a section 2 violation of the Voting Rights Act and must be redrawn. * There is no need to rule on whether or not new district 25 is itself a racial gerrymander in violation of section 2 because the changes to district 23 will of necessity affect district 25 and it is therefore moot. However, the lower court decision that it was not in violation of section 2 is vacated. * The case is remanded for further proceedings. Dissents on Districts 23 & 25 Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Alito dissented. Justice Scalia also dissented and, joined by the Chief Justice and Justices Thomas and Alito, argued that District 23 violated neither the Voting Rights Act nor the Equal Protection Clause. * Nowhere in the American Voting Rights Act or legislative history is compactness of districts mentioned and that the majority is causing the jurisprudence of section 2 to diverge more and more from the legislative history. * New district 25 is more than an adequate replacement for old 23 (if necessarily), and indeed the majority accepts that new district 25 performed better for Latinos in 2004 than old district 23 from 1992--2002\\\\. =District 24= Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, found that the plan did not crack Texas's 24th congressional district in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Justice Scalia, joined by Thomas, concurred in that judgment but felt the case should be dismissed as non-judicable. Justice Souter, joined by Ginsburg, dissented, arguing to vacate and remand. Justice Stevens dissented, arguing to reverse. The majority of the court noted that old district 24 had three separate communities to begin with (Whites, Blacks, Latino) and Martin Frost (a White Democrat) never having been challenged in 22 years in a primary made it impossible to dispute the state legislative history that it was specifically created for a White Democrat. Practical result On August 4, 2006, the three-judge court made its remedial order. The three-judge court adjusted the lines of the 23rd and four other districts ‚Äî the 28th (represented by Democrat Henry Cuellar), 25th (Democrat Lloyd Doggett), 15th (Democrat Ruben Hinojosa) and 21st (Republican Lamar S. Smith) ‚Äî all of which held new primary elections on November 7. Cuellar, Doggett, Hinojosa, and Smith were all reelected, while Henry Bonilla, the Republican representative for the 23rd District, was defeated by Democrat Ciro Rodriguez in a newly 61% Latino district.

At , the pier is the longest in Wales and the fifth longest in England and Wales. In 2005, was voted \\"Pier of the Year 2005\\" by the members of the National Piers Society. At the end of the pier is a deep-water landing stage, completely rebuilt for the third time in 1969, which is used by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company for occasional excursions to Douglas, Isle of Man, and for an annual visit of the PS Waverley or the MV Balmoral preserved steamers. The June 2007 sailings of the Balmoral were rescheduled to start at Menai Bridge Pier, after it emerged that Llandudno Pier's Landing Stage was no longer safe to use. The Landing Stage was rebuilt in 2012 and the MV Balmoral called there, the first ship since 2006, on 2 July 2015. Location Located on the coast of North Wales between Bangor and Colwyn Bay, the pier is very unusual in that it has two entrances, one on the promenade at North Parade and the other, the original entrance, on Happy Valley Road. Between the two entrances is the Grand Hotel. History Lady of Mann to the Isle of Man on 26 May 2005 Pier head and landing stage viewed from the deck of the MV Balmoral on 14 July 2006 The pier had its origins in a much shorter pier of just built on 16 wooden piles, opened in 1858 by the St George's Harbour and Railway Company, which had just completed its branch line from Llandudno to Conwy via a junction with the Chester and Holyhead Railway near the present Llandudno Junction railway station to which the branch was soon diverted. That short pier was built to protect the rights of its owners to a much more ambitious scheme to build a major port in Llandudno Bay. Unfortunately, the pier was severely damaged in the Royal Charter Storm of 25 October 1859, which caused the loss of 223 ships and 800 people in British coastal waters. Although repaired and used for a further 16 years, the pier was too short and could only be used by steam ships at high tide. MV Balmoral awaiting passengers for an afternoon cruise to the Menai Bridge, Puffin Island and Red Wharf Bay on 14 July 2006 The present pier was designed by civil engineers James William Brunlees (1816-92, knighted 1886) and Alexander McKerrow (1837-1920) and built by the contractor John Dixon for the Llandudno Pier Company http://www.engineering- timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=384. After the original designs were approved on 29 May 1876 by Parliament, the town's Improvement Commissioners and the Mostyn Estate, revised designs for the ornamental ironwork and elaborate kiosks were worked on by the architects Charles Henry Driver (1832-1900 Obituary, The Builder v.79, 10 Nov 1900, 423-4) and Charles H. Rew for Brunlees and McKerrow, in close collaboration with the Glasgow Elmbank foundry Dobraszczyk, P. 2014. Iron, Ornament and Architecture in Victorian Britain. Myth and Modernity, Excess and Enchantment. Routledge, Abingdon. 148-150. The pier was opened to the public on 1 August 1877. https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4515402/4515405/11/llandudno%20pier%20opening%201877 The landwards extension to the same design, still in deep water and also supported on iron columns, was opened in 1884 and a new landing stage was added in 1891. In 1969, the landing stage was totally rebuilt in concrete and steel, which enabled its use by the largest Isle of Man Steamers then in use. The wooden decking has been extensively renewed in recent years, and the superstructure is maintained systematically. The pier is currently owned by Tir Prince Leisure Group, a north Wales based leisure company. The Pier Pavilion Until the Second World War, the public were charged admission to access the pier. Admission allowed the promenaders access to musical entertainment from a bandstand at the pierhead. A small orchestra was established in 1877. The notable French musician, Jules Rivi√®re was appointed to take charge of the orchestra in 1887. The orchestral performances moved to the Pier Pavilion, built on land adjacent to the main entrance from the promenade, which opened in September 1886. Rivi√®re's Orchestra at the Llandudno Pier Pavilion trebled in size to symphony proportions. The young Henry Wood came to Llandudno to observe the then elderly Rivi√®re at work. The pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1994 and not rebuilt.

Skiing in the Uludaƒü range (February 2007 photograph) Habitats of the park range from maquis on the lower slopes, through deciduous woodland and beech and fir forest to alpine meadows at the highest levels. It is a refuge for mountain birds, such as lammergeier and other vultures, golden eagle and more than 20 other raptor species. Other high-altitude species include alpine accentor, rock thrushes and choughs. The area is also good for eastern specialities such as isabelline wheatear, and, at almost the most westerly points of their range, red-fronted serin and Kr√ºper's nuthatch. The dense fir forest holds short-toed treecreeper, common crossbill and Tengmalm's owl, a rare and very local bird in Turkey, as well as the white-backed woodpecker. The rare and local butterfly, Parnassius apollo graslini, is found on Uludag and the area has much of interest to botanists, with colourful pink primroses (Primula vulgaris var. sibthorpii), leopard's bane (Doronicum orientale), crocuses: the purple Crocus siberi and yellow Crocus flavus, and grape hyacinths (Muscari racemosum).

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 288 - 289. History =Origins of the clan= Traditional origins Traditionally the Napiers are descended from the ancient Earls of Lennox who were one of the Celtic royal families of Scotland and Ireland. One theory holds that a \\"naperer\\" is \\"a person in charge of table linen in a royal or manor house‚Äù and that the original Napiers must have been ‚Äúnaperers‚Äù as an office for the royal household. However, there is not much evidence for this title being used in Scotland. Another origin for the name is that one of the knights of the Earl of Lennox, possibly a younger son of the earl, distinguished himself in battle in support of William the Lion. After the victory the king singled him out praising his valour by saying \\"nae peer\\". In 1625, Sir Archibald Napier of Merchiston, the first Lord Napier, presented an affidavit to the College of Heralds, in which he described this origin of the name Napier, as having been bestowed by the king (probably Alexander II) on one Donald Lennox in recognition for acts of bravery. He states: Recorded origins The first certain reference to the name Napier is in a charter of Malcolm, Earl of Lennox some time before 1290, in which he granted lands to John de Naper in Kilmahew and Dunbartonshire. The Napiers held the lands at Kilmahew for eighteen generations until 1820. =15th century and clan conflicts= The first Lord of Merchiston was Alexander Napier who was a prominent merchant in Edinburgh. He amassed a fortune and became Provost of Edinburgh. He obtained a charter for the lands of Merchiston in 1436. His son was Sir Alexander Napier, who also became Provost of Edinburgh and rose to high royal favour. He was wounded rescuing the widow of James I of Scotland and her second husband, Sir James Stewart, who had been captured by rebels. In 1440 Napier was honoured by James II of Scotland by being made Comptroller of the Royal Household and was later also made Vice Admiral of Scotland in 1461. His son was John Napier who was also the son-in-law of the Earl of Lennox who was executed in 1444. John did not press the family's claim to the earldom and was killed at the Battle of Sauchieburn in 1488. =16th century and Anglo- Scottish Wars= John Napier, 8th Laird of Merchiston, inventor of logarithms John Napier's heir, Alexander, and also his grandson were both killed in 1513 at the Battle of Flodden. Another Napier heir was killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. =17th century and Civil War= The most famous of the name was John Napier the seventeenth Laird of Merchiston who developed the system of Logarithm. In 1617 he was succeeded by his son, Archibald Napier, 1st Lord Napier who accompanied James VI and I to claim his new throne in England. Napier married the daughter of the fourth Earl of Montrose and sister of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. As the brother-in-law of the king's captain the Napiers supported the king throughout the Scottish Civil War. Lord Napier died in 1645 and his only son, Archibald Napier, 2nd Lord Napier, was forced into exile and died in the Netherlands in 1660. Archibald Napier, 3rd Lord Napier petitioned to the Crown for a new patent to the barony and extended the succession to female heirs. The title passed to the only child of his eldest sister, Thomas Nicolson, 4th Lord Napier. The title then passed to his aunt, Margaret Napier, wife of John Brisbane who was Secretary to the Admiralty in the reign of Charles II of England. She was succeeded by her grandson, Francis Napier, 6th Lord Napier, who was originally Francis Scott but adopted the name and arms of Napier. =Napoleonic Wars= Three grandsons of the sixth Lord Napier served throughout the Napoleonic Wars. General Sir Charles Napier conquered Sind in India, which is now part of Pakistan and his statue can still be seen in Trafalgar Square, London. Castles Merchiston Tower, historic seat of the chiefs of Clan Napier, in the centre of the campus of Edinburgh Napier University *Kilmahew Castle, Cardross, Dunbartonshire, is the ancestral home of the Napiers of Kilmahew. It is now a ruin. *Merchiston Tower, Edinburgh, is the ancestral home of the Napiers of Merchiston. It is the centre of the Merchiston Campus of Napier University. *Other castles built or owned by the Napiers include Culcreuch Castle (Fintry, Stirlingshire) and Lauriston Castle (Edinburgh). Clan chief The current chief of the clan is the Right Honourable Francis David Charles Napier, 15th Lord Napier, 6th Baron Ettrick, and 12th Baronet of Nova Scotia. Heraldry The Clan Napier does not possess a coat of arms. In Scotland it is primarily individuals that are granted coats of arms. The arms of the Clan Chief, or to give him his full title, Chief of the Name and Arms of Napier are: Quarterly, 1st & 4th, Argent, a saltire engrailed cantoned of four roses Gules, barbed Vert; 2nd & 3rd, Or, on a bend Azure, a mullet pierced between two crescents of the Field, within a double tressure flory counterflory of the Second (see article on heraldry). The chief of the clan is the only person permitted to use these arms. The original arms of Napier (as seen in the picture of John Napier on this page) were: Argent, a saltire engrailed between four roses gules, barbed vert. These arms bear striking similarity to the arms of the Clan Lennox (see origin of the clan, above, for explanation). The arms of the current chief are the Napier arms quartered with a differenced version of the Scott coat of arms, added when the Napier family absorbed the Scott Baronetcy of Thirlestane (see Lord Napier). Trivia The Western Australia Police Pipe Band, a Pipe band based in Perth, Australia, has worn the Napier tartan since 1966.

The journal was established in 1992 by the Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy (Vilnius University, Lithuania) as Baltic Astronomy, obtaining its current title in 2017 when it converted to open access. The journal is devoted to publishing research, reviews and news spanning all aspects of astronomy and astrophysics. The editor in chief is Prof. Beatriz Barbuy (IAG, University of S√£o Paulo).  History  Open Astronomy is the continuation of publishing in the open access model of Baltic Astronomy, which was published by the Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy in Vilnius for astronomical institutions of the Baltic states. The political liberation in the then Soviet Union during the later part of the 1980‚Äôs enabled increased international contacts. For greater international visibility, a modern journal publishing in English was desired, replacing several less visible publication series from the observatories in Tartu, Riga, and Vilnius. Each of those had, during Soviet rule, published mainly in Russian. Following discussions among the Baltic astronomical institutes, it was agreed to discontinue those publications once Baltic Astronomy was launched. Some regrets were expressed for the discontinuation of the long-running Publications of the Tartu Astrophysical Observatory (Estonian title: W.Struve nimelise Tartu Astrof√º√ºsika Observatooriumi Publikatsioonid), which, with some name variants, had been published at Tartu Observatory since 1817 (Latin title of its volume 1: Observationes Astronomicas, Institutas In Specula Universitatis Caesareae Dorpatensis: Observationes Annorum 1814 Et 1815, Una Cum Reductionibus). Its final volume 53 appeared in 1990. Also the more recent Proceedings of the Tartu Astrophysical Observatory (Estonian title: W.Struve nimeline Tartu Astrof√º√ºsika Teated), started in 1954, were concluded with its number 109 in 1991. In Latvia, the publication series Investigations of the Sun and Red Stars by the Radioastrophysocal Observatory of the Latvian Academy of Sciences in Riga (Latvian title: Saules un sarkano zvaig≈æ≈Üu pƒìtƒ´≈°ana), started in 1974, published its final volume 36 in 1993.

Since ancient times, popcorn has been a popular snack food, produced through the explosive expansion of kernels of heated corn. Commercial large scale popcorn machines were invented by Charles Cretors in the late 19th century. Many types of small scale home methods for popping corn also exist. Commercial popcorn machines are commonly found in movie theaters and carnivals, producing popcorn in a pan of hot oil, which has approximately 45% of its calories derived from fat. Hot air popcorn poppers appeared for home use in the late 1970s, which produce popcorn with only 5% of its calories derived from fat. The majority of popcorn sold for home consumption is now packaged in a microwave popcorn bag for use in a microwave oven. As a result, the popularity of popcorn makers for home use has drastically decreased in the last few decades.  History  An early popcorn machine in a street cart, invented in the 1880s by Charles Cretors in Chicago Old movie theater popcorn machine, Cinema Museum (London) Charles Cretors traveled the Midwest and settled in Fort Scott, Kansas for a few years, and then Decatur, Illinois. He spent his time working in the painting and contracting business, opened a bakery, and eventually a confectionery shop. As each venture led to the next, Cretors discovered he had a passion for how things worked. As an addition to the confectionery shop, Cretors purchased a peanut roaster to broaden his offerings to include fresh roasted peanuts. Not satisfied with how the machine worked, he redesigned it to work better. It was at this time that Cretors moved his wife and family to Chicago where he felt he could become a commercial success by selling his new machine. It was 1885. Cretors wanted to test his new roaster under everyday conditions, and he also needed money. So, he purchased a vendor's license and put his machine on the sidewalk in front of his shop to test it and sell product at the same time. The date on the vendor's license is December 2, 1885, which marks the inception of C. Cretors & Company. The new roaster was driven by a small steam engine, which automated the roasting process, which was a new concept. A chance meeting happened between Cretors and a traveling salesman who purchased a bag of roasted peanuts. The salesman, J.M Savage, was very intrigued with the new peanut roaster, and offered to sell it in his territory. Cretors agreed to the proposal, and hired his first salesman. By 1893, Cretors had created a steam powered machine that could roast 12 pounds of peanuts and 20 pounds of coffee, pop corn, and bake chestnuts. Popcorn was becoming the next popular choice for snackfood. Cretors redesigned his automated roasting machine so it would roast peanuts and pop popcorn at the same time. Cretors' machine design offered several advantages over the hand-operated process. First as a machine, it made operation more predictable and it provided an attraction for both the retailer and the customer. There was the novelty of the steam engine, and the Tosty Rosty Man, a small mechanical clown that acted as a merchandiser for the machine. Cretors' machine became the first automated machine that could pop popcorn uniformly in its own seasonings. As a result, the product came out the same way every time. Cretors applied for a patent on his new automated peanut roaster and popcorn popper machine on August 10, 1891. U.S. Patent 506,207 was granted to Cretors on October 10, 1893. Charles Cretors took his new popcorn wagon and peanut roaster to the midway of Chicago's Columbian Exposition in 1893 and introduced the new corn product to the public in a newly designed machine that included a popcorn wagon. After a trial period where Cretors gave away samples of his new popcorn product, people began to line up to purchase bags of the hot, buttered popcorn.  Variants  Specialised popcorn pots, also called stove top poppers, have been marketed under various brand names, including The Detonator, Whirley Pop, Theater II and Sweet & Easy; all of them are basically a pot that has an integrated stirring blade operated by turning a crank. This is to prevent burning of the kernels on the bottom and, under limited conditions, enables users to make sweetened popcorn by mixing sugar directly with the kernels before they pop. The Detonator stove top popcorn popper In 1978, Presto introduced the Popcorn Pumper, a popper for consumer use in the home, which used hot air blown up through the kernels. By cooking without oil, it reduced the calories and fat in the finished product. It was also faster and easier than pan fry popping. Home popcorn makers are also available, which consist of an electrically heated circular tray with a powered stirring arm, into which corn and oil can be placed, with a dome shaped cover which often doubles as a serving bowl. In circa 1974, Pillsbury made microwave popcorn for sale in vending machines (and later to wide distribution in supermarkets, as microwave oven sales increased), thus reducing the need for a separate appliance in some homes. To improve flavour, texture and shelf life of pre-packaged microwave popcorn, companies started adding diacetyl, PFOA, and trans-fats into the packages which has led to some concern among health conscious snackers.

Overview The management of risk data and information is key to the success of any risk management effort regardless of an organization's size or industry sector. Risk management information systems/services (RMIS) are used to support expert advice and cost-effective information management solutions around key processes such as: * Risk identification and assessment * Risk control * Risk financing Typically, RMIS facilitates the consolidation of information related to insurance, such as claims from multiple sources, property values, policy information, and exposure information, into one system. Often, RMIS applies primarily to ‚Äúcasualty‚Äù claims/loss data systems. Such casualty coverages include auto liability, auto physical damage, workers' compensation, general liability and products liability. RMIS products are designed to provide their insured organizations and their brokers with basic policy and claim information via electronic access, and most recently, via the Internet. This information is essential for managing individual claims, identifying trends, marketing an insurance program, loss forecasting, actuarial studies and internal loss data communication within a client organization. They may also provide the tracking and management reporting capabilities to enable one to monitor and control overall cost of risk in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In the context of the acronym RMIS, the word ‚Äúrisk‚Äù pertains to an insured or self-insured organization. This is important because prior to the advent of RMIS, insurance company loss information reporting typically organized loss data around insurance policy numbers. The historical focus on insurance policies detracted from a clear, coherent and consolidated picture of a single customer's loss experience. The advent of the first PC and UNIX based standalone RMIS was in 1982, by Mark Dorn, under the trade name RISKMASTER. This began a breakthrough step in the insurance industry's evolution toward persistent and focused understanding of their end-customer needs. Typically, the best solution for an organization depends on whether it is enhancing an existing RMIS system, ensuring the highest level of data quality, or designing and implementing a new system while maintaining a focus on state-of-the-art technology. Common types of RMIS Most major insurance companies (carriers), broker/agents, and third- party administrators (TPAs) offer or provide at least one external RMIS product to their insureds (clients) and any brokers involved in the insurance program. Most commonly, RMIS products allow individual claim detail look-up, basic trend report production, policy summaries and ad hoc queries. The resulting information can then be shared throughout the client's organization, usually for insurance program cost allocation, loss prevention and effective claim management at the local level. More advanced products allow multiple claim data sources to be consolidated into one ‚ÄúMaster RMIS,‚Äù which is essential for most large client organizations with complex insurance programs. The primary users of RMIS are risk/insurance departments of insured organizations and any insurance broker involved. It is much less common for the insured's safety department and vehicle operations department to have access to RMIS despite similar interest in the data. In fact, safety and vehicle operations of larger organizations typically maintain their own separate database systems of ‚Äúaccidents/incidents,‚Äù many of which will correlate to RMIS claim data. Insurance companies normally use a different version of externally provided RMIS for internal use, such as by underwriting and loss control personnel. Occasionally, there could be timing or other differences that could cause data discrepancies between the internal system and externally provided RMIS. Insurance brokers have a similar need for access to their insured client's claim data. Brokers are normally added as an additional user to the RMIS product provided to their clients by the insurance carrier and TPAs. The information available from RMIS is critical to the broker for interfacing effectively with their counterparts in the insurance carrier and TPAs. Additionally, effectively presented RMIS information that shows trends and analysis is essential to successfully marketing their clients' insurance programs. Insurance carrier and a TPA claim adjusters traditionally use claims management systems to collect and manage claim information and to administer claims. Some client organizations, however, may choose to manage certain types of claims or those within a loss retention layer and thus use this type of system as well. Typically, the claims management system provides the primary data to RMIS products. RMIS products in turn provide an externally accessed view into the client's claims data. RMIS products are commonly available directly from larger insurance carriers and TPAs, but the most advanced systems are often offered by independent RMIS vendors. Independent RMIS vendor systems are most desirable when a client organization needs to consolidate claims data from multiple current insurance programs and/or past programs with current program information. Key vendor attributes and differences  Along with insurance carriers, broker/agents and TPAs that offer their own proprietary systems, there are a variety of direct RMIS technology companies who sell to direct insureds and even the carriers, broker/agents and TPAs themselves. Major differences among RMIS vendors include: *Currency of technology (Internet-based vs. Internet-accessible); *System speed (response time for screen changes, report generation time, etc.); *Flexibility in meeting client requirements (custom screen views, client-defined data fields, special reports, etc.); *Ongoing support service quality (availability of senior/quality technical support, help desk availability, dedicated staff and stability, etc.); *Data quality control (data conversion accuracy, data source cleanup, etc.); *Pricing (first-year cost, ongoing cost, custom programming charges, data record storage fees); *Availability of related modules (property exposure management, policy management, claim/incident setup, occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) record keeping, claims audits, etc.); *Turnaround time for data loads; *Foreign conversion/support (financial fields, language, fluent support staff, etc.) RMIS system compatibility varies among carriers, broker/agents and TPAs. However, quality independent RMIS vendors by design can take almost any claim data source and convert or map the data to their particular system's file structure. A few major insurance carriers offer similar consolidation services, i.e., combining the insured client's current claim data with another carrier's or TPA's data for the same insured client. The other data sources can be for current separate insurance programs or from expired insurance programs. Usually, this type of consolidation service is performed to accommodate their major policyholder organizations. Major TPAs, however, more commonly offer such data consolidation services. Average costs and market drivers The cost of a typical independent RMIS product varies from $60,000 to $150,000 for the first year, and ongoing annual charges are slightly less. Insurance company RMIS product lines typically average around $50,000 for the first user, but they often offer less expensive light-weight versions for claim look-up only. More costly full-featured products are sometimes available with more advanced reporting systems. The products are usually priced on a per-user basis on a sliding scale for a larger number of users. Insured clients' brokers are given access at no cost or occasionally for a flat annual fee for multiple insured clients with a particular broker. TPAs commonly include one or two RMIS access IDs within their claims management pricing to encourage both the client's broker and the client to use their claim look-up product. Normally, beyond the first two access IDs, the pricing follows the same per-user range of the insurance companies. The cost drivers of RMIS include: * Number of user/access IDs * Number of outside claim data sources that must be converted (carriers and TPAs do not have to convert their own data) * Frequency of outside claim data updates * Special programming/report development charges * Training of users (initial and annual users' conferences) Higher cost systems do not always correlate to better performance in terms of both usefulness and speed. While most carrier and TPA RMIS systems are similarly priced, the independent RMIS vendors' price range varies significantly, as previously mentioned.

It rests on the south bank of the Tarwin River and at the , had a population of 115. History The original settlement is believed to have started at an area called Tarwin Meadows. The area south of Tarwin Lower is still called by this name. Tarwin Lower is on the banks of the Tarwin River. The first major land-holder in the area was George Black. Black leased land from the Bass River through to Cape Liptrap. Black bought the Tarwin Meadows Run in 1851.(http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/black-george-2999) Several drowning fatalities have occurred over the years primarily because of the tidal nature of the river. One of the most well-known is that of a young man who drowned in the river many years ago. His gravestone is situated on River Drive just before the roundabout. Until 1990 camping along the banks of the river was a summer pastime for many families from around the state. This was discouraged because of the risk of flooding, and the lack of supervision of swimmers in a tidal river. The Post Office opened on 1 February 1881. The Town today The majority of the town is on its main street ‚Äî River Drive ‚Äî and is often passed through by holiday makers on their way to nearby Venus Bay, or as a scenic route to Walkerville and Waratah Bay. The main shopping strip is home to several small shops [including supermarket], Community Church (Uniting and Anglican services alternate each Sunday, Catholic Mass on Saturday 6pm), local Mechanics Institute [hall], tennis courts and CFA. Behind River Drive is the small primary school and the Community Centre which hosts several small groups and is visited by doctors, welfare nurse and occasional other medical plus education services for under school-age children. During main holiday weekends and periods throughout the year Tarwin Lower hosts a decent market catering to all tastes. It is mainly based at the Mechanic's Institute hall and its surrounding land, and continues to sprawl each time it runs. At the western end of the town is the local fishing jetty and a very long picnic table. The town is home to the local football team, the Tarwin Sharks, who were premiers in 2004 in the local Alberton Football League. Until recently a small golf- course operated on River Drive. A walk along the boardwalk exists along the banks of the River from Venus Bay to Tarwin Lower. This is very busy during summer months with walkers and cyclists of all ages. The town has hosted the Unify Gathering Heavy Music Festival from 2015 to 2019, and will again in 2020.http://unifygathering.com/ The campsite and arena have been situated on the football grounds and surrounding fields. Notable people Notable people from or who have lived in the area of Tarwin Lower include: * Frank Vale, cold storage industry and dairy factory industry pioneer * Margareth Clement, the Lady of Swamp.

He starts to play his fiddle, which draws to him a wolf, fox, and hare, none of which is the company he seeks. Using the animals' admiration for him and his playing, he tricks each of them into becoming ensnared or trapped so that he can continue on his way alone. He finds a companion that he seeks, a woodsman, but at that time the wolf has worked itself free, and frees the fox and hare on his way to pursue the musician. Just as the animals come upon the musician with the goal of doing him mischief, the woodcutter steps in front and protects him with his axe. The animals leave, and the musician thanks the woodcutter with another song, and then leaves.

It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the strategically important Downs anchorage off the English coast. Comprising a keep and four circular bastions, the moated stone castle covered and had 39 firing positions on the upper levels for artillery, with 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns. It cost the Crown a total of ¬£27,092 to build the three castles of Sandown, Walmer and Deal, which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences. The original invasion threat passed, but during the Second English Civil War of 1648‚Äì49, Sandown was seized by pro-Royalist insurgents and was only retaken by Parliamentary forces after several months' fighting. By the 19th century, the castle was suffering badly from the effects of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for ¬£35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea. History =16th century= Sandown Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.; Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale. A 1539 early design for either Sandown or nearby Walmer Castle In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and Charles took the annulment as a personal insult.; This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.; An invasion of England appeared certain.; In response, Henry issued an order, called a \\"device\\", in 1539, giving instructions for the \\"defence of the realm in time of invasion\\" and the construction of forts along the English coastline.; Sandown and the adjacent castles of Deal and Walmer were constructed to protect the Downs in east Kent, an important anchorage formed by the Goodwin Sands that gave access to Deal Beach, on which enemy soldiers could easily be landed.; The stone castles were supported by a line of four earthwork forts, known as the Great Turf, the Little Turf Bulwark, the Great White Bulwark of Clay and the Walmer Bulwark, and a long defensive ditch and bank. Collectively the castles became known as the \\"castles of the Downs\\" and cost the Crown a total of ¬£27,092. The castle was built between April 1539 and the autumn of 1540, by a team including Richard Benese as the surveyor, William Clement as the master carpenter, and Christopher Dickenson as the master mason.; It was nearly identical to its sister castle at Walmer, with a tall keep, across, at the centre, and flanked by four rounded bastions, also called lunettes, and a moat, which was surrounded in turn by a curtain wall.; ; Its curved walls were thick. In total it was approximately across, covering . The historian John Hale considered the castle to form a transitional design between older medieval English designs and newer Italian styles of defence. Sandown had three tiers of artillery ‚Äì the heaviest and longest range weapons occupying the upper levels ‚Äì with a total of 39 firing positions, and 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns should close defence be required.; The embrasures in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the guns to operate and traverse, and the interior of the castle was designed with vents to allow the smoke from its guns to escape. It was initially garrisoned by a captain, two lieutenants, two porters, ten gunners and three soldiers, at an annual cost of ¬£174 a year. =17th century= Ground floor plan: A ‚Äì moat; B ‚Äì gatehouse and porter's lodge; C ‚Äì battery of seven guns; D ‚Äì keep; E ‚Äì inner passageway; F ‚Äì gunroom and gunners' cabins; G ‚Äì battery of five guns Although the original invasion threat passed, Sandown continued in military use into the 17th century. A 1616 survey nonetheless reported that a range of repairs were needed, at an estimated total cost of ¬£437, while a 1634 survey noted that work estimated at ¬£1,243 was required. In contrast, an inspection in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable structural condition, but antiquated in design. A report produced in 1641 suggested that ¬£8,000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs, including ¬£3,000 for additional sea defences. Sandown Castle did not play a prominent role during the first English Civil War that broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament; it was taken by Parliamentary forces at the start of the conflict in 1642. Following the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Sandown and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent.; Vice-Admiral William Batten had been forced by Parliamentary officials to resign from his post as Commander of the Fleet the previous year, and he now encouraged the fleet to join the Royalist faction.; Sir Henry Palmer, a former sailor, accompanied by other members of the Kentish gentry, also called on the fleet to revolt, taking advantage of the many fellow Kentish men in the crews. Sandown Castle declared for the King, followed shortly afterwards by the garrisons at Deal and Walmer as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast or aid sent to the Scots. Parliament defeated the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June, and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with Sandown and the other castles along the Downs.; Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged and surrendered on 12 July. An earthwork fort was then built between Sandown and Deal, which may have been defended by around 150 men each. Deal was attacked in late July, and in August artillery assaults began on Sandown as well. The Royalists mounted an attack from the fleet on 10 August, with a second attack following on 15 August, involving a landing of 750 men supported by 50 soldiers from Sandown. Neither operation was successful and Sandown finally surrendered on 5 September, a few weeks after the surrender of Deal.; In 1649, Parliament ordered that supplies of ammunition and powder be sent to Sandown and the other castles of the Downs. Fresh earthworks were erected during the Interregnum between Sandown and Deal to address with the threat of Dutch attack. The garrison at Sandown remained substantial during the period, with a governor and 21 soldiers, but when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain and 18 men. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II, the townsfolk of Deal seized Sandown Castle on behalf of William III, the Prince of Orange. The former Parliamentarian, Colonel John Hutchinson, was infamously detained by the Crown at Sandown in 1664; his wife, Lucy, who subsequently widely publicised his case, described the castle as ruinous and his imprisonment there as inhumane. After several months Hutchinson died in the castle, his doctor blaming his physical decline on the conditions in which he had been kept. =18th‚Äì21st centuries= Engraving of the castle in 1853 In 1785, the sea broke through the outer walls of the castle, and coastal erosion continued over the next few years. The castle was initially described as being \\"barely habitable\\", but by 1793 it was considered \\"unfit for habitation.\\" It was repaired and garrisoned again during the French Revolutionary Wars, with two new artillery batteries being constructed to the north of the castle.; Early in the 19th century the castle was used as by the early coastguard for the suppression of local smuggling.; Coastal erosion continued during the 19th century. As a consequence, the War Office sold off the reusable materials of the fortification for ¬£564 in 1863 and demolished the upper parts of the castle, leaving a level platform across the lower parts of the keep and the bastions.; Part of the stone was purchased by the Earl of Granville and used in his building work at Walmer Castle, while other masonry was reused in the construction of Deal Pier.; The sea continued to erode the remaining stonework and destroyed one of the adjacent artillery batteries ‚Äì the other was converted for use by the coastguard. In 1882 the Royal Engineers used explosives to remove around of masonry from the castle for use in the construction of an officer's house at Dover Castle, causing further damage.; In 1883 architectural historian Hayter Lewis complained to the British Archaeological Association that more needed to be done to protect the ruins, contrasting their poor treatment with that of the other castles along the coast. Despite this, concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea, and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using guncotton. The town of Deal then bought the remains from the government for ¬£35 for use as part of their local sea defences. Coastal erosion continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were encased in concrete to form a sea wall, although they remain vulnerable to further coastal erosion.; The remains of the castle are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.

Constructed from stone with angular bastions, its design was a hybrid of Italian military architectural thinking with traditional English military design. The site was raided by a French force that summer while the fortification was still being constructed. The site suffered from coastal erosion and the castle was demolished in 1631. History =16th century= Background Sandown Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely.; Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale. In 1533, Henry then broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon and remarry. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England.; Henry responded in 1539 by ordering, through an instruction called a \\"device\\", the construction of fortifications along the most vulnerable parts of the coast. The immediate threat passed, but resurfaced in 1544, with France threatening an invasion across the Channel, backed by her allies in Scotland. Henry therefore issued another device in 1544 to further improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Construction Built between April and September 1545 to protect the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight, Sandown Castle overlooked Sandown Bay. It was constructed by the Italian engineer Giovanni Portinari, the surveyor William Ridgeway and the captain of labourers, John Portinar, at a cost of ¬£2,400.; ; Designed around a central courtyard, it had a square tower and two angular bastions on one side, and a circular bastion looking out to sea. The rear of the stone defences was protected by a moat, and the castle had a wooden pier for boats to dock at.; The angular bastions echoed contemporary Italian thinking on military architecture, and may have been influenced by Richard Lee, the King's Surveyor of Works, as well as by Portinari's own continental background.; Despite being relatively advanced for an English fortification, the castle did not feature the more fashionable Italianate \\"arrow-head\\" bastion design used at nearby Yarmouth Castle and has been critiqued by historians: Andrew Saunders describes it as an imperfect \\"hybrid\\" of English and continental ideas, John Hale as a timid, confused flirtation with modern designs.; ; Before the castle could be completed, however, the French attacked. Admiral Claude d'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July, where the local authorities feared Sandown Castle might be the target of a night attack.; ; 2,000 French soldiers men landed on the Isle of Wight and attacked Sandown, where labourers were still present. Their advance soon stalled, however, and the French retreated back to their fleet, bringing the invasion threat to an end; the castle was finally completed after their departure. =17th century= By the 17th century, coastal erosion had undermined the castle's walls. In 1627, Charles I announced that he would repair the fortification but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new fortification, Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore at low tide.; ; See also * Castles in Great Britain and Ireland Notes References Bibliography   * Forts on the Isle of Wight Device Forts Buildings and structures completed in 1545 Buildings and structures demolished in the 17th century Sandown ","title":"Sandown Castle, Isle of Wight"},{"id":"5745825","text":"Keeley may refer to: People =Surname= *Barbara Keeley, British Labour MP *Damian Keeley (born 1963), English professional football player *Earl Keeley (born 1936), Canadian football player *Edmund Keeley (born 1926), American author, translator, and Professor Emeritus of English *Fred Keeley (born 1950), American politician from California; state representative *James Keeley (1867-1934), American newspaper editor and publisher * Joseph C.

As he has successfully achieved the construction or remodeling of various diocese landmarks (such as Mayag√ºez's cathedral) he has also been nicknamed \\"Ulises Trump\\". Bishop Casiano retired on July 6, 2011. Pope Benedict XVI named Alvaro Corrada del Rio as his successor. Ulises Aurelio Casiano Vargas died on Sunday August 5, 2018 at Hospital de la Concepci√≥n de San Germ√°n, Puerto Rico at age 84. He was buried at Our Lady of the Candelaria Cathedral in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico.

The interdisciplinary study is a subfield of area studies, and can be composed of numerous disciplines such as economics, sociology, history, international relations, political science, geography, gender studies, and literature. Definition Latin American studies critically examines the history, culture, international relations, and politics, of Latin America. It is not to be confused with Latino Studies, an academic discipline which studies the experience of people of Hispanic ancestry in the United States. Latin Americanists consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse research tools in their work. The interdisciplinary disciplines of study varies, depending on the school, association, and academic program. For example, the Latin American Centre of the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS) at the University of Oxford heavily focuses on the social sciences, such as the economics, politics, and development of the region. The Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona also focuses on social sciences with faculty from Anthropology, Geography, Political Science, Sociology, and History an places emphasis on issues related to anti-racism, human rights, security, environment and health. On the other hand, schools like Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies (LLILAS) at The University of Texas at Austin, focus on the humanities; with the language, culture, and history of Latin America as a central component. Others include the study of environment and ecology of the region. Latin American studies is usually quite open and often includes or is closely associated with, for instance, Development studies, Geography, Anthropology, Caribbean studies, and Transatlantic studies. History Latin America has been studied in one way or another ever since Columbus's voyage of 1492. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scientist explorers such as Alexander von Humboldt published extensively about the region. Towards the end of the nineteenth century and at the turn of the twentieth, within the region itself writers such as Jos√© Mart√≠ and Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥ encouraged a consciousness of regional identity. In 1875, the International Congress of Americanists held its first meeting in Nancy, France, and has met regularly ever since, alternating between venues in Europe and in the Western hemisphere. However, unlike the scholarly organizations of the twentieth century, the ICA does not have an ongoing organization, nor is there a journal of the ICA. The creation of formal and ongoing scholarly organizations focusing on Latin America is a product of the twentieth century. In the US, historians with an interest in Latin American history within the American Historical Association created a group focusing on Latin America. In 1918, they founded The Hispanic American Historical Review, which has published quarterly since that time and has built a reputation as one of the premier scholarly journals.see homepage The Latin Americanists within the AHA created the Conference on Latin American History in 1926, which is now separately incorporated (since 1964), but continues to coordinate its annual meetings with the American Historical Association. In 1936, US Latin Americanists also founded the Handbook of Latin American Studies, with editorial offices in the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress. In a pre-digital era, the compilation of annotated bibliographic references in the humanities and social science organized by subject and country was a vital tool for scholars in the field.Howard F. Cline, \\"The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix,\\" Latin American Research Review, Vol 2 No. 1, (Autumn, 1966) pp. 57-79.http://salalm.org/Conf/2016/04/panel-11-the-hispanic-division- and-the-handbook-of-latin-american-studies-highlighting-luso-hispanic- collections-in-the-library-of-congress/ accessed 13 August 2016. In 1954 was founded in Paris the Institute of Latin American Studies (IHEAL), by the geographer Pierre Monbeig.About IHEAL, accessed 15 November 2019. With the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the US government began seriously focusing on Latin America as Cuba and the hemisphere was seen to be an integral element of Cold War politics. The Latin American historian who wrote the early history of the founding of the Latin American Studies Association wryly suggested in 1966 that at some future date Latin Americanists should erect a statue to Fidel Castro, the \\"remote godfather\\" of the field, who instigated a renewed US interest in the region.Howard F. Cline, \\"The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix,\\" Latin American Research Review, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Autumn 1966), p. 64. Interest in Latin American studies increased starting in the 1950s. In the US, Latin American studies (like other area studies) was boosted by the passing of Title VI of the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) of 1958, which provided resources for Centers of Area and International Studies. In the UK, the 1965 \\"Parry Report\\" provided similar impetus for the establishment of Institutes and Centres of Latin American Studies at Oxford, London, Cambridge, and Liverpool.Jos√© C. Moya,ed. The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. viii. In Canada, York University in Toronto established the first Latin American center, \\"in part thanks to the inflow of exiled intellectuals from South America.\\"Moya, The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, p. viii Germany's Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin had been founded in 1930, but not until the 1970s did it experience expansion.Moya, The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, p. viii.

The Palatinate- Neuburg line became extinct with her father and was succeeded by the Palatinate-Sulzbach line. Her sons with Count Palatine Joseph Charles of Sulzbach would have been the indisputable heirs to the Electorate of the Palatinate, but they all died in infancy. She was the Hereditary Princess of Sulzbach by marriage. Life Of Charles Philip's six children (five daughters and one stillborn son), Elisabeth Auguste was the only one to reach adulthood. She was the third daughter of Charles III Philip, then Count Palatine of Neuburg, and his first wife, Ludwika Karolina Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. One of her sisters, Maria Anna, died before Elisabeth Auguste was born, aged one or two, and her sister Leopoldine died the year she was born, aged three. Her mother died on 25 March 1695, when Elisabeth Auguste was about two years old, and her father remarried when she was about eight years old to Princess Teresa Lubomirska. Her two half-sisters from her father's second marriage both died before turning three. In 1716, her father succeeded his brother Johann Wilhelm as the Elector of the Palatinate. By then it was evident that the Palatinate- Neuburg line (established by two grandsons of Duke George of Bavaria, Otto Henry and Philip) would become extinct, as Charles III Philip and his brothers had all failed to produce a legitimate male heir. It was also obvious that the related Palatinate-Sulzbach line would succeed them. Joseph Charles, the eldest son of the Count Palatine of Sulzbach, was the clear heir. On 2 May 1717, Elisabeth Auguste married Joseph Charles in a move that united the two lines. The sons of the union would be the indisputable heirs of the Electorate of the Palatinate, preventing another succession war. However, all their sons died in infancy and only three daughters survived. Elisabeth Auguste died in childbirth in 1728. Her husband died the following year in Oggersheim. The inheritance of the Electorate of the Palatinate passed to her husband's brother, John Christian Joseph's family. Upon her father's death in 1742, her husband's nephew, Charles Theodore, became Elector. Their daughter, also named Elizabeth Augusta, married Charles Theodore and became Electress. Children She was married in Innsbruck in 1717 to Count Palatine Joseph Charles Emanuel August of Sulzbach, son of Theodore Eustace of Sulzbach and Maria Eleonore of Hesse-Rotenburg. They had the following children: * Charles Philip (1718‚Äì1724) * Innocenza Maria (1719‚Äì1719) * Elisabeth Auguste (1721‚Äì1794); married Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria * Maria Anna (1722‚Äì1790); married Clement, Duke of Bavaria and Count Palatine * Maria Francisca (1724‚Äì1794); married Frederick Michael, second son of Christian III, Duke of Zweibr√ºcken * Charles Philip August (1725‚Äì1728) * a son, Pfalzgraf von der Pfalz (1728‚Äì1728) Through her daughter Maria Francisca, she was a grandmother of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria.

Grammar For example, \\"Bani Kaab\\" literally means the sons of Kaab: the house of Kaab. Due to the Arabic grammar rules, the word can sometimes become \\"Bani\\" depending on the context. For example, it is \\"Banu Kaab's language\\", but \\"belongs to the Bani Kaab\\". Sometimes, it's \\"Banis\\". An alternative transliteration of \\"Bani\\" is Banee,\\"Banee Israel\\" or vernacular Beni (B√©ni in French transliterations). The word itself is derived from the same root as the patronymic particle \\"ibn\\" or \\"bin\\". Uses \\"Bani Israel\\" is a common Arabic word for the children of Israel; a Quranic chapter is named so. The term itself is very close to its Hebrew counterpart: B'nei Yisrael' (◊ë◊†◊ô ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú) (also B'nai Yisrael, B'nei Yisroel or Bene Israel). Other than tribes, persons can have the words in their name, Fatima bint Hizam was nicknamed Umm Baneen, \\"mother of many sons\\".

Since Adam is considered the first man in the Abrahamic religions, Banu Adam means \\"Humankind\\". \\"Bani Adam\\" (son of Adam) or \\"Bint Adam\\" (daughter of Adam) is used as a term for a \\"human being,\\" especially when reminding or admonishing people to \\"act like human beings\\" (i.e. respect rules of politeness and propriety). \\"Banu\\" is the plural of the word \\"Ibn\\" or \\"Bin\\", which means \\"Son of\\". Paternal lineage was clearly identified in Arab history as a sign of good or bad standing. All names were followed by \\"Bin\\" (male) or \\"Bint\\" (female) and the name of the father. \\"Banu\\" is also present in several place names in Spain, such as Benidorm and Benicarl√≥. As a form of Arabization, the word Beni has often been used in official place names or personal names instead of Berber names such as Ath, Ayt and so on.

An inscription in the lower left corner states: \\"Although Strabo and Ptolemy and the majority of the ancients were most assiduous in describing the world we, however, bring together in this picture and carefully show in their true places the new knowledge that escaped their diligence and remained unknown to them\\".ETSI STRABO AC PTOLEMEUS ET PLERIQUE VETERUM DESCRIBENDI ORBIS FUERE STUDIOSISSIMI NOVORUM TAMEN DILIGENTIA QUEDAM AB EIS TANQUAM INCOGNITA PRETERMISSA ADINVENIT QUE NOS HOC PICTURE AD VERAM LOCORUM SCIENTIAM EXPRIMENDAM STUDIOSE IUNXIMUS A 2014 multispectral imaging project led by Chet van Duzer revealed many previously-illegible details of the map, including a depiction of a porcupine in northern Asia, references to mythological peoples such as the Hippopodes and the Panotti, and a surprising amount of information about the interior of Africa- knowledge that likely originated with the Ethiopian delegation to the 1441 Council of Florence Martellus‚Äô map served as an inspiration for the Waldseem√ºller map of 1507. The overall layout was similar, and Martin Waldseem√ºller used the same projection as Martellus, the pseudo-cordiform projection. Both cartographers added decorative wind-heads in the borders of their maps, and both also took advantage of the extra space in the lower corners of the maps created by the swooping lines of the projection to add text blocks in those corners. The shape of northern Africa is the same on both maps, that is, it is Ptolemaic with a sharp northwestern corner. The shape of eastern Asia is similar on the two maps, with a huge peninsula jutting southwestward into the Indian Ocean, and Japan is in precisely the same position on the two maps, at the eastern edge.Chet Van Duzer, ‚ÄúWaldseem√ºller's World Maps of 1507 and 1516: Sources and Development‚Äù, The Portolan, No.1, Winter 2012, p.12. Martellus also produced an Insularium Illustratum (\\"Illustrated Book of Islands\\") of which four manuscripts are extant, plus one draft in Biblioteca Laurentiana. It contains an illustrated description of islands of the Aegean Sea, mostly copied from a previous work by Cristoforo Buondelmonti, plus maps from other islands, several regional maps and a world map. He has been identified with an Arrigho di Federigho who authored the first translation into German of Bocaccio's Decamerone. According to this theory, the surname Martellus would come from the Martelli family, to which Henricus / Arrigho was linked.Rezension von L.

Sarah is narrated by an unnamed boy whose mother Sarah is a lot lizard: a prostitute who works the truck stops in West Virginia. She can be abusive and abandoning, yet he longs for her love and has begun wearing her clothes and imitating her. Plot summary The boy agrees to work for Glad, a benevolent pimp who specializes in \\"boy-girls.\\" Glad gives him a raccoon penis bone, which he wears as an amulet for protection, good fortune, and sexual prowess as well as to signify his status as one of Glad's boy-girls. He is given the name Cherry Vanilla, but on his first date with a trucker he uses the name Sarah. Hoping to outperform his rejecting mother and become the greatest lot lizard of them all, he goes off on his own into the wilds of West Virginia and is eventually taken up by a very powerful and very dangerous pimp known as Le Loup. Unaware that this new girl is a boy, Le Loup uses him not to turn tricks but as an object of veneration ‚Äì and donations ‚Äì with luck-conscious and magic-fearing truckers. Eventually Saint Sarah's mystique fades, and when he is revealed to be a boy Le Loup forces him to work alongside other boy prostitutes and live in captivity with them. After an agonizing year, Glad is finally able to rescue him from Le Loup, but the boy who returns is no longer capable of rejoining Glad's boy-girls; his mother Sarah is long gone as well. In an afterword, the boy who is now a grown man tells the reader that his therapist, Dr. Owens has suggested he write about his experiences as to ‚Äúbetter his recovery‚Äù. The boy closes the story by revealing that Sarah was found in an abandoned trailer after shooting herself. He stops to wonder why he ever tried to be like her, before realizing that the only thing that mattered was that he wasn't. Sarah uses narrative elements and characterizations that also occur in the short stories of The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things (2001). But unlike The Heart or Harold's End (2004), Sarah is rich in humor and more fabulistic in its characters and situations. These qualities temper the harsh themes this novel shares with the other JT LeRoy books: abuse, exploitation, abandonment, betrayal, loss. Like them, it also explores the dynamics of identity and gender and employs the plot situation of having one's hidden life exposed and the shaming, hostility, and violence that ensue. Poet and critic Stephen Burt called Sarah \\"a work of art\\" and \\"a book about the risks and thrills of false identity,\\" which derives its power \\"from the glee with which it refuses realism: multiple subjects (sexual trauma, coming out, rural poverty) that American fiction usually depicts with flat-footed seriousness instead come together for a Technicolor romp.\\" In popular culture The song \\"Cherry Lips\\" by Garbage refers to Cherry Vanilla from Sarah and the persona of JT LeRoy. The song \\"Sarah\\" by Bat for Lashes was also inspired by the novel Sarah.

The solution to this puzzle is unique (up to mirror reflections and rotations). It was named after its inventors Jan Slothouber and William Graatsma. The puzzle is essentially the same if the three 1 √ó 1 √ó 1 blocks are left out, so that the task is to pack six 1 √ó 2 √ó 2 blocks into a cubic box with volume 27. Solution Solution of Slothouber- Graatsma puzzle in exploded view with colour denoting orientation The solution of the Slothouber‚ÄìGraatsma puzzle is straightforward when one realizes that the three 1 √ó 1 √ó 1 blocks (or the three holes) need to be placed along a body diagonal of the box, as each of the 3 x 3 layers in the various directions needs to contain such a unit block. This follows from parity considerations, because the larger blocks can only fill an even number of the 9 cells in each 3 x 3 layer.Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy: Winning ways for your mathematical plays, 2nd ed, vol. 4, 2004. Variations The Slothouber‚ÄìGraatsma puzzle is an example of a cube-packing puzzle using convex polycubes. More general puzzles involving the packing of convex rectangular blocks exist. The best known example is the Conway puzzle which asks for the packing of eighteen convex rectangular blocks into a 5 x 5 x 5 box. A harder convex rectangular block packing problem is to pack forty-one 1 x 2 x 4 blocks into a 7 x 7 x 7 box (thereby leaving 15 holes); the solution is analogous to the 5x5x5 case, and has three 1x1x5 cuboidal holes in mutually perpendicular directions covering all 7 slices.

Although his work had mainly been forgotten, his Greenery Street, a novel of early married life in upper middle-class London, was republished in 2002. Biography Mackail was born in Kensington, London, on 3 June 1892, to John William Mackail and Margaret Burne-Jones, the daughter of the painter Edward Burne-Jones. Educated at St Paul's School, Hammersmith, he went to Balliol College, Oxford, but failed to complete his degree through ill-health after two years. His first work was as a stage-set designer, notably for J. M. Barrie's The Adored One and George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (1914). The outbreak of World War I interrupted this promising start. Mackail was not fit enough for active service, but took work in the War Office and the Board of Trade. In 1917 he married Diana Granet, only child of Sir Guy Granet, a War Office director-general for railways. The couple had two children, Mary (born 28 March 1919) and Anne (born 12 January 1922) and lived in Chelsea, London. The need to support his young family led Mackail to write a novel at a time when office jobs became insecure after the end of the war. This led to a first short-story being accepted by the Strand Magazine and to the services of a literary agent, A. P. Watt. Denis was soon earning enough from his writing to give up his office work. He published a novel a year from 1920 to 1938. Among his literary friends were P. G. Wodehouse and A. A. Milne. During the 1930s Mackail lived at Bishopstone House, Bishopstone, East Sussex.

He was known in particular for his electrifying speed as a forward. Career Muzzi started his career with A.S. Roma, making his debut in Serie A on 11 February 1990, in a league match against Inter ended in a 1‚Äì1 tie, and scoring his first goal the following season. With Roma, he won the Coppa Italia in 1991, also helping his side to reach an all-Italian UEFA Cup Final that season, losing out to Inter, also missing out on the 1991 Supercoppa Italiana, which was won by Sampdoria.

Location and access Marino roughly encompasses the area within the boundaries of Sion Hill Road, Gracepark Road, Philipsburgh Avenue (north of Lynch's), Malahide Road and Shelmartin Terrace. Marino borders other northside areas such as Fairview, Donnycarney and Clontarf. It is two kilometres from the GPO in O'Connell Street. The area is served by the Clontarf Road DART station. Dublin Bus operates route 123 through Marino, with other routes passing around the edges. History The townland of Marino was carved out of the townland of Donnycarney which was granted to the Corporation of Dublin following the dissolution of The Priory of All Hallows in the reign of King Henry VIII. In 1787, it was described by English writer Richard Lewis as \\"a small village a mile beyond Drumcondra and two-and-a-half miles from Dublin Castle.\\" The well known Casino was built in 1759 as a summer house in the grounds of Marino House, demolished in the 1920s. A tunnel linking it to the main house for servants' use is where Michael Collins and his men carried out tests with their first Thompson sub-machine gun. The Asgard guns are believed to have been hidden here. The area was full of members of the Irish Citizens' Army. Jim Larkin lived in Croydon Park House and Countess Markiewicz and James Connolly were frequent visitors. The area was developed for housing in the late 1920s and 1930s on the former estate lands of the Earl of Charlemont in the civil parish of Clonturk (now Marino, Fairview and Drumcondra). It is notable as one of the first examples, in the newly formed Irish state, of an affordable housing project and was the first local authority housing estate in the country. It is heavily influenced by the garden city movement. The estate was built on the site of a planned formal garden for Marino House and the original design was followed when the streets were laid out. This gives Marino its symmetrical layout. When it was first built, purchases of houses was restricted to large families, while alcohol, dogs without leads and children after dark were banned from the parks. The area consists of about 1,300 houses built for the most part of concrete, which was an unusual building material at that time in Ireland. The scheme was designed by Frederick Hicks and H.T. O'Rourke and the houses were built by a private contractor using a proportion of immigrant German builders.EMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS IN SAORSTAT, Dail Questions, 13 November, 1925 The houses each cost ¬£657 to build (approximately ‚Ç¨40,000 at today's costs)Irish Senate Debate, LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL, 1926, 23 February 1927 but the average selling price was ¬£450. https://web.archive.org/web/20070311025745/http://www.oireachtas- debates.gov.ie/S/0008/S.0008.192702230009.html The development centred on a large circular 'green', Marino Park, with adjoining symmetrical green areas such as Marino Green, the green area in the middle of Croydon Park Avenue is known locally as the \\"D\\" walls, that give the area a highly distinctive character when seen from the air.

The Casino at Marino The Casino is a famous piece of Irish neo-classical architecture. It was designed by William Chambers as a pleasure house for James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont. It is regarded as one of the finest 18th century neo-classical buildings in Europe. The Casino, meaning \\"small house\\", contains a total of 16 finely decorated rooms.

Several months later, it was released as a single in the UK, peaking at number 39. The song modulates stylistically between a sweeping piano-and-orchestra ballad similar to McCartney's \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and upbeat rock sections before ending in a raucous and passionate finale. History McCartney first presented this composition for The Beatles' consideration during the Get Back rehearsals on 14 January 1969 at Twickenham Film Studios in London, but the album was aborted before anything could be done with the song, which eventually did not make it onto Let It Be either. According to McCartney, this song and other car-based songs in his late-Beatles and early solo career, such as \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"Helen Wheels,\\" were inspired by the long road trips he and Linda used to take as the Beatles were breaking up. Most of the song is a piano-based ballad. But it is interspersed with orchestral sections and sections inspired by 50s-style rock 'n' roll. Allmusic critic Stewart Mason likens the main tune to those of McCartney's Beatle songs \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"You Never Give Me Your Money.\\" Mason compares the effect of the various song sections to the medley from the Beatles Abbey Road and to some of the Beach Boys' post-Pet Sounds work. McCartney said of the song: Reception John Lennon felt that this song, among others on the album, was directed critically towards him; in particular, he perceived the protagonists who sing \\"We believe that we can't be wrong\\" to be himself and Yoko Ono.McCartney: Songwriter p. 104 Allmusic critic Stewart Mason claims that in the context of the criticism McCartney was receiving in the aftermath of the Beatles breakup, this line sounds more like a \\"statement of personal intent\\" than the declaration of love it could be in the context of the song's lyrics themselves. In a contemporary review for RAM, Jon Landau of Rolling Stone described \\"The Back Seat of My Car\\" as one of only two good songs he enjoyed on the album, the other being \\"Eat at Home\\". Landau further described the song as \\"the album's production number\\". Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the song demonstrated the \\"imaginative and gorgeous\\" arrangements on Ram and called the song its \\"sad, soaring finale.\\" Mason considers it to be the \\"true highlight\\" of Ram.

Magnifico was an opponent of Winnipeg's anti-smoking bylaw, and sought to provide his bar patrons with a loophole to the law in 2003. Although he enforced the ban in the bar itself, he also purchased an old yellow school bus that he parked outside his hotel as a \\"smoking section\\". Provincial inspectors later argued that the bus constituted a public indoor space and was therefore in violation of the bylaw, and issued a $1,500 fine.Lindor Reynolds, \\"Magnifico butt bus idea busted\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 November 2003, B1; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Hotel's 'butt bus' busted\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 December 2003, A6.

He won an upset victory, defeating two better-known francophone candidates.Aldo Santin, \\"Franco Magnifico, St. Boniface\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 June 2004, B2. He was 49 years old at the time of the election. In his victory speech, Magnifico said the results marked the end of the Old St. Boniface Residents Association's dominance over local politics. Magnifico quickly emerged as a vocal ally of newly elected Mayor Sam Katz.

The forest borders Martha's Vineyard Airport on three sides and is chiefly in the towns of West Tisbury and Edgartown. The forest is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. Description Correllus State Forest is a forest principally used for biking and hiking. Situated in the center of Martha's Vineyard, the park is the focus of one of the largest environmental restoration projects in the country as the DCR is working to bring back the park's native ecosystem. The park lies within the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion. Landscapes within the park include grasslands, heathlands, pine barrens, and woodlands. Oak and pine are the dominant trees within the park. Many rare species may also be located here. History Created in 1908 as the \\"Heath Hen Reserve\\", the original purpose of the reservation was to prevent the extinction of the heath hen, a type of grouse that lived in the pine barrens of New England. Unfortunately, by late 1938 the last heath hen had disappeared from the forest and the species was officially classified as extinct. The forest later took the name of the superintendent who ran it from 1948 to 1987 Despite widespread land clearing for farming and other purposes across Martha's Vineyard throughout its history, much of the area within Correllus State Forest did not suffer this fate. However, due to forest fires and other natural processes, the forest is not considered old-growth. During World War II, Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Martha's Vineyard (operational today as Martha's Vineyard Airport) was established within the confines of the forest as part of a donation from the state to the United States Navy. Frequent fires have been a problem in the Correllus State Forest. Between 1867 and 1929 there were sixteen fires of more than each on Martha's Vineyard. In 2003, the DCR, in conjunction with the University of Massachusetts began evaluating methods for controlling fuel sources in the Pitch Pine and Scrub Oak areas. Methods included thinning of pitch pine stands, mowing of shrub understories, and grazing of regrowth by sheep. In 2008, about of dead red pine were removed to reduce fuel loading and to restore pitch pine‚Äìscrub oak sand plain through USDA Forest Service funding. Activities and amenities The forest offers of trails for hiking, bicycling, horseback riding, and cross-country-skiing. Restricted hunting is also available. References External links *Manuel F.

The population taken at the 2011 census was 159. History Its history is closely linked with that of the nearby Compton Verney estate, for which it once served as the estate village, providing living accommodation for a number of the servants. The village dates from at least the time of Henry I, circa 1086, when a small medieval church was built in the village. There is, however, no separate reference to it in the Domesday book. By 1279, following a stocktaking by Edward I known as the Hundred Rolls, Combrook was identified as located in the Kineton hundred. It remained part of the Kineton parish until 1858, when it was separated from Kineton and united with the ecclesiastical parish of Compton Verney. A number of the buildings in the village have a similar style, most easily seen in the church. The original church was modified in Tudor times, with the chancel being rebuilt again in 1831. The present building was erected in 1866, to a design by John Gibson, paid for by the Dowager Lady Margaret Willoughby de Brook of Compton Verney, keeping the existing chancel. John Gibson went on to design the Victorian neo- Elizabethan estate houses and the horse drinking troughs in the village in the same style as that of the church. A number of the other houses in the village are thatched, with clear signs of original thatched roofs visible on several other dwellings. Until the sale of the Compton Verney estate in 1929, Combrook was a \\"closed\\" village, entirely owned by the Lord of the Manor, who could determine who lived there, and Combrook today is still considered to be one of the best-preserved estate villages in the country. The largest house in Combrook once served as the school, and there has been a school on the site since at least 1641. The building which now serves as the village hall was built as the village school in 1855, and seems to have served as a design template for John Gibson's style for the church and estate houses. The village school was closed in 1966. Etymology The name \\"Combrook\\" derive from the words \\"cum\\" meaning valley, and \\"broc(e)\\" meaning brook, and simply refers to its location in a valley beside a brook. The name is variously presented as \\"Combroke\\" (on the road signs at entry to the village, and for official purposes by Stratford-on-Avon District Council), or \\"Combrook\\" (as used by Warwickshire County Highways Department and the Royal Mail), or even \\"Combrooke\\", as used by Severn Trent Water. Historical variations have included Cumbroc and Combroce (13th century rolls), Cumbrok (Dugdale 1656), Combebrooke (1658 church flagon) and Cumbroke (1817 map).

The song, a standard rock number, features McCartney on lead vocals, electric guitar, bass and drums and Linda McCartney performing backing vocals. Lyrics and music Paul McCartney described the lyrics of \\"Eat at Home\\" as \\"a plea for home cooking ‚Äì it's obscene.\\" Beatle biographer John Blaney described it as fitting within the theme of many of McCartney's songs of the period, \\"extolling the virtues of domestic bliss and...the love of a good woman.\\" Music professor Vincent Benitez also considers the theme to be a celebration of Paul's domestic bliss with Linda in the wake of the Beatles' breakup. \\"Eat at Home\\" is in the key of A major. It is mostly a three-chord rock song, with predominant use of the tonic chord of A, the dominant chord of E and the subdominant chord of D. It also employs the leading-tone chord of G in turnaround sections between the verses and the bridge passages. Blaney described the music as being an \\"upbeat slice of retro-pop\\" that was influenced by McCartney's hero Buddy Holly. Reception Music critic Stewart Mason of AllMusic described it as McCartney's homage to Buddy Holly, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, also of Allmusic, described it as \\"a rollicking, winking sex song.\\" In a contemporary review for RAM, Jon Landau of Rolling Stone described \\"Eat at Home\\" as one of two only good songs he enjoyed on the album, also comparing it to Buddy Holly.

Although John Lennon was highly critical of many of the songs on Ram, feeling they were veiled attacks on him, he publicly admitted that he enjoyed this particular song quite a bit.

It is owned and operated by Cumulus Media through licensee Radio License Holding SRC LLC and airs an adult contemporary format, using the slogan \\"Today's Hits and Yesterday's Favorites\\". WARM-FM's studios and offices are located on Susquehanna Plaza Drive off US Route 30 in York, halfway between downtown York and Lancaster. The transmitter is nearby off Brummer Lane. History =Easy listening WSBA-FM= On September 1, 1962, the station first signed on as WSBA-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1964 page B-138 It was owned by the Susquehanna Radio Corporation, who also held WSBA (910 AM) and WSBA-TV (Channel 43, now WPMT) in the York media market. Susquehanna, headquartered in York, eventually owned more than 40 stations in Pennsylvania and other parts of the country. At first, WSBA-FM simulcast its AM counterpart. But a short time later, WSBA-FM switched to a beautiful music format of soft instrumentals with limited talking and commercials. The station remained easy listening for the next two decades, competing with WGAL-FM (101.3 FM), a station licensed to serve Lancaster. But by the 1980s, the easy listening format started to age. WSBA-FM added more vocals, and in the mid-1980s, switched to a soft adult contemporary sound. =Move to adult contemporary= In 1988, the WARM-FM call sign was moved to the station, having previously been used by a Susquehanna-owned station in Atlanta called \\"Warm 99\\", now WWWQ. (There is another station holding the WARM call letters at 590 AM in Scranton, also owned previously by Susquehanna and today by Cumulus.) WARM-FM has always broadcast some type of adult contemporary (AC) music format from the time of its inception and was repeatedly ranked at the number one spot in the York radio market into the early 2000s, with significant listening also in the adjacent Lancaster and Harrisburg radio markets. However, following the trends of other AC stations in the country, the station \\"freshened up\\" its playlist in the mid-2000s and discarded all but a handful of pre-1980 titles, focusing more heavily on current and recent pop hits. The station began leaning slightly in a hot AC direction, although still positioned as a mainstream AC, as it continued to play a considerable percentage of soft hits from the 1980s and 1990s. In 2006, Susquehanna Radio's stations, including WARM-FM, were sold to Cumulus Media, one of the biggest owners of radio stations in the US. =Switch to Wink 103= On September 8, 2011, WARM-FM officially changed its branding to \\"Wink 103\\". This is similar to co-owned WNNK-FM (104.1 FM), often the number one station in nearby Harrisburg, which has been known as \\"Wink 104\\" for many years. As Wink 103, WARM-FM straddled the line between AC and hot AC. It dropped the Wink identification on December 26, 2012, returning to the \\"Warm 103.3\\" branding. Syndicated programming on WARM-FM includes The John Tesh Radio Show on weeknights, both the 1980s and 1990s versions of Backtrax USA on Saturday nights, and Your Weekend with Jim Brickman Sunday mornings. =Christmas music= On November 23, 2012, WARM-FM began playing all Christmas music. On December 26, 2012, after the Christmas season, the station returned to its adult contemporary format. Each year it has followed the same pattern of going All-Christmas in early to mid-November and returning to its AC format on December 26. While the FM station plays holiday tunes, the website also offers what it calls its \\"Scrooge Stream\\" playing the usual format. Signal note WARM-FM is short-spaced to WPRB (licensed to serve Princeton, New Jersey) as they operate on the same channel and the cities they are licensed to serve are only 112 miles apart. The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on the same channel according to current FCC rules is 150 miles.
