Their descendants were then called \\"Rosselli del Turco Sassatelli.\\" The Palazzo remained in their possession until 1922. In the courtyard of the building, there's a well, a fountain, and some sculptural fragments.

She is the author of Old Times in Dixie Land: a Southern Matron's Memories (1901). Early life Caroline Elizabeth Thomas was born on Cottage Hall Plantation, East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, on November 24, 1825. Her father was Capt. David Thomas (1777-1849), who belonged to a prominent South Carolina family. A veteran of the Battle of New Orleans, David Thomas was a trustee of the college which later became the Centenary College of Louisiana. Her mother was Elizabeth Patillo, who died in 1833. She was educated by governesses at home. Career Merrick devoted the first 20 years of her married life to raising a family. At that time, the temperance cause was being widely agitated in the South, and some women favored the movement. She became at once president of a local union, and filled the position of State president for Louisiana. She wrote extensively on the subject, but her chief talent was in impromptu speaking. She was a very successful platform orator, holding an audience by the force of her wit and keen sarcasm. Merrick was described by Frances Willard, president of the WCTU from 1879‚Äì1898, as a \\"That is the lady who can make the W.C.T.U. a success, even in the volatile city of the Mardi Gras\\". Caroline Elizabeth Merrick (ca. 1888) She favored woman suffrage, and for years, she stood comparatively alone in her ardent championship of the cause. She was the first woman of Louisiana to speak publicly in behalf of women. She addressed the State convention in 1879, and assisted to secure an article in the Constitution making all women over 21 years of age eligible to hold office in connection with the public schools. It required considerable moral courage to side with a movement so cruelly derided in the South, but, supported by her husband, she always worked for the emancipation of women through her writing, defining the legal status of woman in Louisiana. She was a valued correspondent of several leading woman's journals. In 1888, she represented Louisiana in the Woman's International Council in Washington D.C., and also in the Woman's Suffrage Association, which immediately afterward held a convention in the same city. She took an active part in the charitable and philanthropic movements of New Orleans. For 12 years, she was secretary of St. Anna's Asylum for Aged and Destitute Women and Children. She was the president of the Ladies' Sanitary and Benevolent Association, president of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and she was unanimously elected president of the Woman's League of Louisiana. She published a series of stories and sketches of Afro Americans of the South, which were widely copied. She wrote some poems that showed a good degree of poetic feeling and talent. She was the author of Old Times in Dixie Land: a Southern Matron's Memories, New York: Grafton Press, 1901. Personal life At the age of 15, she married Edwin Thomas Merrick (1808-1897), a 37 year old jurist, who served as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana for ten years before the American Civil War, and was reelected under the Confederacy. Their family consisted of two sons and two daughters. Merrick died in March 1908.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History The US-12‚ÄìColdwater River Bridge was constructed in 1920 by the Brookville Bridge Company for the Michigan State Highway Department at a cost of about $12,000. The bridge was constructed as a trunk line bridge on what was then US-112 (and now has been re-designated US-12). In 1933, the roadway was straightened, eliminating a sharp turn at the end of the bridge, and the state constructed a new bridge nearby. Responsibility for this bridge was then turned over to the city of Coldwater. (note: large pdf file) The bridge was closed to automobile traffic in the late 1990s due to severe rust deterioration, but was open to pedestrian traffic until it was deemed unsafe and condemned on August 25, 2017. The bridge was demolished in April 2018, and will eventually be replaced with a pedestrian bridge. Description The bridge was a five-panel steel Pratt pony truss bridge with a 64-foot span.

These statuettes are considered Spartan manufacture dating from the 6th century B.C., and they were used as decorative attachments to ritual vessels as votive dedications, such as a cauldron, suggested by the bronze rivet on their feet. The figures typically have their hair hung down, right arm slightly bent, left hand lifted the hem of the chiton skirt and expose part of the left thigh, likely to facilitate the movement, and their legs in a wide stride. The style the statuettes is attributed to Laconia (the region where Sparta is located) workshops in Archaic Period. The typical characteristics of Laconian bronzes are slender bodies with unproportional muscular legs, arched and swelling thighs, immature chest in female figures, and long faces with strongly marked facial features. Laconia bronzes were widely traded, which helps to explain why some of those Laconia manufacture were not discovered in the region. It may also suggest the possible presence of Laconian craftsmen at that site.  History  Female athletic costume in ancient Greece  The statuette in British Museum is in a special kind of outfit: a short chiton affixed to the left shoulder leaving the right shoulder and breast bare. This is the type of athletic costume especially for the participant in Heraea Games, the earliest recorded women running competition held quadrennially in Olympic stadium. Although women in Ancient Greece (except Sparta) were not encouraged to participate in athletic activities and were excluded from the Olympic games, they could participate in the foot race at the Heraea, which was an athletic event for girls of all ages. Thus, this particular piece depicts a participant in the Heraea. One speculation proposed that the costume is adapted from a light garment worn by men in hot weather or while performing hard labor. The piece from the National Archaeological Museum, Athens is wearing a different kind of dress. Unlike the costume for Heraea Game, the bodice of the chiton covers both shoulders and breasts. It may suggest that this running costume is for girls at local ritual festivals in Sparta that are documented in ancient literature. During the festival, some Spartan maidens ran a special race in honor of Dionysus. This ritual celebrating the girls' rites of passage also involved dancing, singing and other athletic events. Location of Sparta in Laconia region of Greece  Athletic Spartan women  Women in Sparta led very different lives from their counterparts in the rest part of ancient Greece in terms of engagement in athletics. Spartan girls were offered a state-supervised educational system separated from the boys, including a physical training program. The aim of the program was to produce healthy mothers of healthy warriors. Spartan girls engaged in various athletic events including running and wrestling. They might even wrestle boys. Spartan girls were said to wear very little when they did sports. Wearing short tunics exposing half of their thighs, Spartan females were called \\"thigh flashers\\" according to some accounts in ancient Greece. There were complaints that they left home \\"with bare thighs and loosened tunics\\" on their way to run and wrestle. Serving as supplements to those ancient literary sources, roughly forty bronze statuettes dating from the Archaic period are found showing young Spartan women dancing or running (including the two discussed ahead). There are even pieces depicting Spartan females playing sports in nudity, just as the Spartan males.  References   Further reading  * Spears, B. (1984).

Weatherby, from A Woman of the Century (1893) Delia Lionia Stearns Weatherby (June 7, 1843 - November 6, 1916) was a temperance reformer and author. Early life Delia Lionia Stearns was born in Copley, Ohio, on June 7, 1843. Her father. Col. John C. Stearns, was a stanch, old-time abolitionist and temperance worker. She received an academic education and afterward taught school in her native town. Career Delia L. Weatherby moved to Baldwin, Kansas with her husband, and was called to the chair of mathematics at Baker University, but declined. Inheriting the same disposition which made her father an abolitionist, she early became an active worker in the order of Good Templars. She could endure no compromise with intemperance, and wherever she lived she distinguished as an advanced thinker and a pronounced prohibitionist. She was a candidate on the prohibition ticket in 1886 for county superintendent of public instruction in Coffey County, Kansas. She was elected a lay delegate to the quadrennial meeting of the South Kansas Lay Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1888. In 1890 she was placed in nomination for the office of State superintendent of public instruction on the prohibition ticket. She always took a great interest in the cause of education. In 1890 she was unanimously elected clerk of the school board in her home district. She was an alternate delegate from the fourth congressional district of Kansas to the National Prohibition Convention in 1892, and also secured, the same year, for the second time by the same party, the nomination for the office of superintendent of public instruction in her own county. She belonged to the white ribbon army and was the president of the Coffey County Woman's Christian Temperance Union for several years. She was superintendent of the press department of the Kansas Woman's Christian Temperance Union and State reporter for the \\"Union Signal.\\" She edited a temperance department in one of the country papers, and she frequently contributed to the press articles of prose and poetry, chiefly on the subject of temperance reformation.

In 1870 they moved to Baldwin, Kansas, where for nine years he served as professor of languages at Baker University. In 1880 her husband entered the ministry again, and for seven years she shared with her husband the toils and duties of an itinerant life, until failing health compelled him to retire from active work, and they moved to a country home, near LeRoy, Kansas. She was the mother of three children: Olive Weatherby Quakenbush (1872-1920), Edward Stearns Weatherby (1876-1957), and a L.S. Weatherby, who later became a professor in a Los Angeles College.

He was granted the Crown Lease of Aberffraw manor. Richard Meyrick II (died 1596), grandson of Meurig ap Llewelyn, fought a legal battle against Hugh Owen of Bodeon over lands included in Aberffraw manor estate. The Bodorgan estate suffered financially, resulting in the selling of large portions of the estate to cover debt.

Erected to mark the then-active entrance to the river, it was abandoned as that channel silted up. It has been in the path of several noteworthy hurricanes, and was heavily damaged. It is on the Lighthouse Digest Doomsday List, and is critically in danger. The lighthouse is at the center of a nature preserve. History This light was erected to replace the old Frank's Island Light, which was abandoned when the neighboring channel became unnavigable. Rather than construct a new tower, in 1855 the iron tower of the Head of Passes Light was moved to a point near the mouth of Pass A L'Outre, the channel of the Mississippi River extending east from Head of Passes, and equipped with a third order Fresnel lens. The first keeper, John Lory, had most recently been keeper at the now deactivated light. When constructed at Head of Passes in 1852, it was America's tallest cast iron lighthouse. It became apparent that such a tall light was unneeded there, and it was moved in 1855 to its present location. Originally the tower was tall; it has sunk into the mud and is about . At the outset of the Civil War Confederate forces removed the lamp and burned the stored lamp oil, and in 1862 burned the keeper's dwelling as well. Union forces returned and removed the lens, and in 1863 they regained control, built a new dwelling, and restored the light to operation. At the same time the outside of the tower was painted with coal tar. By 1868 the tower was sinking into the mud of the delta: originally the beacon stood at above mean low water; by 1886 this was reduced to and to in 1920. The tower was settling evenly and no action was taken, other than raising the floor of the tower and cutting a new door in the side. In 1871, a steam fog whistle was added; it was discontinued in 1880. The steam fog signals were authorized by an appropriation Act of Congress in 1871 in the amount of $10,000.00. A 1917 hurricane damaged the dwelling and its outbuildings, and it was raised again; another door was cut in the tower as well. Two years later the black tower was repainted with a spiral Barber's pole black and white daymark pattern, similar to that on the Cape Hatteras Light. By this time Pass A L'Outre had become much shallower, and the light was deactivated and abandoned in 1930, though it was used for a time as lookout for smugglers before the end of prohibition. Steven Coludrevich, Assistant Keeper of the light was the recipient of a special award. bestowed by the Director of Commerce, for excellent service under extreme adverse conditions during the hurricane. By act of Congress in 1934, the Secretary of Commerce was authorized to deed the lighthouse reservation to the State of Louisiana for state park purposes. Although Hurricane Katrina did not overturn it, the lantern was loosened. By 2007 the tower was decapitated, its lantern having fallen into the water. The tower remains, bereft of its lantern and rusty, sunk deep into the swamp around it. The lighthouse is listed on the Lighthouse Digest Doomsday List as being highly endangered. The light is accessible only by boat, but the tower is closed. It is owned by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Delta National Wildlife Refuge is the site manager.

It was founded in 2014 upon the acquisition of KBC banka in Serbia, by Telenor Serbia, one of the largest telecommunications operators in the country. History The banking licence was originally awarded to \\"Alco banka\\" in 1996, and was in ownership of Serbian businessman Miroljub Aleksiƒá. The bank later changed its name to \\"A Banka\\". In June 2007, \\"A Bank\\" was sold to the Belgian KBC Group for 100 million euros. After the transaction, it changed name to \\"KBC Bank Serbia\\". The Belgian bank was present in Serbia from 2007 up until 2014, when they announced their retreat from the Serbian market. They made a deal with Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Srbija to sell its portfolio to this bank, while the banking licence and the bank itself were sold to Telenor Group, which was already present in Serbia, as a telecommunications operator. Thus, Telenor banka was founded, and commenced its operations in September 2014. In July 2017, a strategic partnership contract was signed between Telenor and the Bulgarian investment fund River Styxx, selling 85% of shares to River Styxx. Telenor would keep a 15% share in bank's ownership, retaining special ties between Telenor Serbia and the bank. However, the transaction was annulled by the National Bank of Serbia in February 2018, due to \\"non- fulfillment of the prescribed conditions established by the regulations of Serbia\\". In October 2019, Telenor banka changed its name to Mobi Banka.

During his studies at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm (1923‚Äì1925), Lindros was employed by the Nordic Museum and Skansen to study buildings around Sweden. One of his study mates was Alfred Westholm, who later recruited him to join the Swedish Cyprus Expedition under the direction of archaeologist Einar Gjerstad. During the expedition the Swedish Cyprus Expedition (1927‚Äì1931), Lindros worked as architect, responsible for measuring and drawing the many maps, plans and sections that are the result of an archaeological excavation. He also worked as a photographer and took an enormous amount of pictures of the excavations. He photographed when SF Studios produced a newsreel about the Swedish Cyprus expedition. As Alfred Westholm had experience in photographic and topographic work, Lindros worked mostly in Erik Sj√∂qvist's excavation team. When Sj√∂qvist was ill, Lindros temporarily took over the excavation in Idalion, Cyprus. He was also interested in documenting Cypriot folklore and visited many remote villages with his camera. John's wife Rosa Lindros followed him to Cyprus and stayed there until June 1928. She also participated in restoration of the archeological findings. Along with expedition leader Einar Gjerstad, John Lindros was responsible for unpacking the archaeological materials after returning to Sweden.

Plot The recruit Saro Franzese befriends the sergeant of his squad, Gianni Tricarico, who immediately becomes infatuated with him. The soldier does not welcome or understand his advances, and, after a lively evening at a disco, criticizes the ambiguous and aggressive behavior of his friend. They leave together in Gianni's car, apparently intending to go back to their barracks, but Gianni drives to a road frequented by transsexuals, many of whom he seems to know well. Saro is not interested in the scene and leaves the car, whereupon he accepts a ride in another car with apparently only the driver on board. But Saro comes back soon after being beaten for trying to defend himself and after being raped by the driver. Saro, wounded and distraught, roams around until he is picked up by Gianni, who, after learning that Captain Silvio Roatta, the commander of their battalion, was one of Saro's attackers, brings him to the hospital of their barracks with the intention to hide what happened; but a day later, a doctor tells him that the soldier cannot stay without official permission and therefore is forced to leave. Gianni then takes Saro to the house of his sister, Paola, where she lives with her husband Mario and their two children. The couple want to know why Saro is in such condition, but Saro refuses to explain and only after a violent outburst does he burst into tears and tell the truth. Gianni reveals that he has jotted down the licence number of the car that Saro got into on the night of the rape and Saro finds that the licence number is correct. Saro and his sister go to a car showroom, where Saro recognizes the driver: it was Vittorio Scarpa, a sex maniac who is heavily in debt and who because of the aforementioned reasons has a difficult and painful relationship with his wife Gabriella and his son Fabrizio. Once recognized, Scarpa is reported to the police and Gianni's captain subpoenas him to appear as a witness. Scarpa tells Roatta about the trial, but the captain, who is engaged to Laura, the mayor's daughter, not only already knew about the trial, but also knows the identity of the witness. He reassures Scarpa that the sergeant depends on him; in fact, ever since the moment Gianni arrives, he has been exerting pressure on him and blackmailing him into letting Scarpa continue his life, which means bringing transsexuals into a secret room inside the car showroom where he enjoys his secret pleasures, and also into reporting Saro for slander. After the beginning of the trial process, Paola invites Gianni to dinner to ask for an explanation, but Gianni replies that he is not going to testify against his captain and, when he is left alone with Saro after a heated fight, confesses to being raped when he was thirteen years old and asserts that he will not support him in any case. The military tribunal has already started the inquiry process and Captain Antonio Marsili is in charge. He first interrogates Saro, who confirms the accusation but is informed that adding to the accusation of slander, he is also subjected to proceedings for retention and for immoral conduct. Later Gianni is called to support the claim that on the night of the alleged rape, he only saw Saro leaving the barracks; after that the captain asks him if there is a relationship between him and Saro, having once seen them \\"joking\\" in the barracks. Captain Marsili then informs him of the proceedings that Saro is subjected to; he also summons a carabiniere who is uncertain about the dynamics of the whole incident and tells him that the investigation will still be difficult. In the meantime, things are not going well in the barracks, either: in fact, Saro is provoked by his fellow soldiers, and Gianni defends him by making him aware of the dangers that run inside the military structure. But the younger man obstinately decides not to drop the charge and even spits in the sergeant's face, whereupon Gianni strikes him by breaking his leg. Marsili visits Saro in the hospital, but the soldier refuses to tell him how the incident happened. When everything seems to work in disfavor for Saro, Scarpa's family unexpectedly offer help: at the hearing, Scarpa's wife bursts into tears, postponing her testimony, while his son breaks his father's alibi by revealing that Scarpa is actually homosexual, addicted to alcohol, and has a violent nature, so that the thirteen hospital admissions of his mother that have come to light are now officially attributed to \\"domestic incidents\\". After the hearing, the attitude of Roatta's fianc√©e, who demands an explanation from him out of suspicion, has also changed, but Roatta punches her with his fist. Captain Roatta, when he is back in the barracks, talks with Gianni and says that he knows Gianni's attack at Saro was merely a way to turn the younger soldier against him. From that moment onwards, he exerts more pressure on the sergeant, withholding freedom from the platoon and forcing the soldiers to undergo back-breaking night-time drills to turn Gianni's comrades against him. After receiving complaints from Corporal Cau, Roatta states that to make things go back to the way they were, problems will have to be \\"solved\\" among themselves. But after meeting with Scarpa, Roatta informs him that if he is left all alone, he will testify against him. Marsili, in the meantime, continues to collide with Gianni over the sergeant's silence on the subject, threatening to put him on trial as well. Gianni continues to deny the accusation, but reveals that two years before, Roatta's driver, the soldier Granelli, went on leave because of neurasthenia. Once the Captain finishes talking with the younger man, he meets Roatta and tells him that he has taken cognizance of the incident, that it was the sergeant who informed him, and that he will do everything possible to expel him from the army, but Roatta is reassured by the mayor that Saro's lawyer, who is also the mayor's friend, has stepped down from the post, and that, also for an electoral motive, he will support him in spite of his daughter's suspicions. However, the inquiry continues and Marsili, having been convinced of Roatta's guilt by now, employs a lawyer for Saro. At the same time, Gianni is attacked and stabbed in the shower by three masked soldiers and just then the intervention of Marsili, who is drawn to the scene by Gianni's screams, saves him. Once he is sent to the hospital, Gianni tells Marsili how the attack happened and confesses that he has been behaving angrily towards Saro. The Captain listens to his confession and gets what he needs to incriminate the culprits, but specifies that if Gianni confirms everything, he will be removed from the army. The sergeant consents and, when he is left alone with Saro, apologizes and asks for a kiss. Scarpa, upon his family's denunciation, is arrested for maltreatment, fraud, and for falsification of accounts, having been heavily indebted to the car dealer. The Captain calls for the remission of Roatta from the army, avoiding in this way the rigidity of the military law, but, disappointed in the high esteem that the officer was placed in, he wishes that the civil law will be inflexible. Marsili, praised by the commander, turns down the promotion nevertheless, remembering Roatta's foreign missions and claiming that he does not want to build his career on the destruction of another officer. At the trial, Gianni confesses everything he has previously confided in the Captain, including the activity of male prostitution. Once he is released, Gianni is greeted by Saro again as his friend; while Roatta, who shows up at the hearing in a camouflage suit, commits suicide with a bayonet before the astonished judge.

The game was released on 12 November 2019 on Microsoft Windows via Steam, with future releases planned for macOS, iOS and Nintendo Switch. The game is a prequel to McMillen's previous roguelike video game The Binding of Isaac.  Gameplay  takes turns matching tiles on a board in order to cast spells, improve their defense, and attack the various enemies of the game. The Legend of Bum-bo melds together gameplay elements from several different video game genres. The player controls Bum-bo or other unlockable characters as they progress through the various levels of the game; each character varies in their starting attributes, such as health, speed, luck, and so on. There are a total of 4 levels, each made up of multiple rooms filled with various enemies that the player must defeat, and a boss fight at the end of each level. In order to defeat the enemies and bosses, the player must match tiles on a board (similar to games such as Bejeweled and Candy Crush Saga) in order to cast spells, improve their defense, and attack. The game is turn-based; the player has a specific number of turns to strategically match tiles before the enemy can move their position and attack, but there are spells and items that allow the player to extend the amount of turns they have. Like most roguelikes, the tiles, rooms and enemy layouts are randomly generated, ensuring no two runs of the game will be the same. Upon clearing a room of enemies, players are given the choice of one of two items that they can use for the rest of the run. When the player defeats the level's boss, they are taken to a transitional area between levels where they can play a number of minigames using the coins they obtained from defeating enemies. These minigames include a wheel that can be spun to increase a given attribute, and a shell game that players can play to earn an item. There is also a shop where players can purchase items for coins directly. Graphically, the game has a cardboard aesthetic, making it seem as if the player is inside a cardboard box.  Plot  The game is a prequel to McMillen's previous roguelike video game The Binding of Isaac. The game centers around Bum-bo, a homeless man that happily lives in a box behind a house on a hill with his trash and his money. Bum-bo hears a voice from above; someone steals his money and disappears down a hole. Bum-bo grabs his trash and jumps down the hole, fighting through hordes of enemies and bosses in pursuit of his money. The game has multiple endings; each one reveals more of the story: Bum-bo finds several treasure chests containing Bum-bos unlike himself (unlocking them as additional characters); he eventually finds a trap door and enters it. After clearing the enemies and boss inside, Bum-bo finally retrieves his money, but hears something mean and huge. The narration is suddenly interrupted by a woman's voice asking Isaac who he's talking to; the game then zooms out of the cardboard box setting to show a child's room, revealing that the entire world of Bum-bo was a fictional creation that Isaac had been playing in, created by Isaac's father. Isaac's mother berates Isaac for playing the game, repeatedly stating that Isaac's father had left them and that it was just the two of them. The game's epilogue is a flashback from when Isaac's father was still around and the two of them were playing Bum-bo; his father narrates the ending of their game in which a slot machine appears and Bum-bo gambles his money. Bum-bo wins, and rules over his kingdom. Isaac's father explains that the world of Bum-bo will continue to grow and grow, and will always be there for Isaac as a way to escape from the real world.  Development and release  The Legend of Bum-bo was developed by designer Edmund McMillen and programmer James Interactive. Described by McMillen as his \\"biggest project\\" with the \\"most difficult design cycle\\", the game was in development for four years and created without a prototype. When the game launched it briefly had softlocks that created backlash on Steam.  Reception  The Legend of Bum-bo received mixed reviews. In a review for PC Gamer, Rachel Watts comments: \\"It's a fun twist on the traditional turn-based roguelike, though it's a little frayed around its cardboard edges. [...] It's frustrating that The Legend of Bum-Bo asks me to think ahead, but doesn't reward me for planning further than the box I'm currently in.

Crotto studied at the Art Student League in New York and then traveled to Europe. He studied for two years at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze and then went to Paris, where he rented a studio in Montmartre and spent another two years at Fernand L√©ger's Academy. He made engravings in Atelier Lacouri√®re in Montmartre, a studio created by Roger Lacouri√®re, where he met Henri Matisse, Joan Mir√≥ and he showed his artwork in group exhibitions with Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Andr√© Derain and Jean Fautrier. While he lived in Paris he was an art teacher at the American School in Paris. Between 1955-1959, Crotto visited Dei√†, Mallorca for the first time, on the recommendation of his friend William Waldren, who described it as a paradise on Earth for artists, writers and poets. He became part of the artistic Dei√† community, he became friends with poet Robert Graves and he returned constantly throughout his life. It was the French gallerist Jeanne Castel who discovered Crotto in 1961. Throughout his life, Crotto had been regularly exhibiting his work in solo and group exhibitions in Europe and United States. In 1963 in France, he was awarded the \\"Prix International de Villeneuve-sur-Lot\\".

In 1997, Mark R. Hughes, the founder of Herbalife, bought the property for $8.5 million from a member of the Shah of Iran's family; after that, it went through a number of owners, following a complex lawsuit after Hughes' death. The property was offered via a website for $1 billion and taken off the market in 2015. One of the owners in 2017 was Victorino Noval. On August 20, 2019, the property was bought back by the Hughes estate for $100,000 at a foreclosure auction. According to a Los Angeles Times report on the same date, Atlanta investor Chip Dickens \\"borrowed around $45 million from the Hughes estate to buy the property, and that debt has since ballooned to roughly $200 million with interest and fees. Three years ago, Dickens transferred ownership to a limited liability company controlled by his partner on the project, Victor Franco Noval. Unable to pay the debts, their limited liability company, Secured Capital Partners, tried ‚Äî and failed ‚Äî to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month, which led the Hughes estate to force a foreclosure auction to either sell the property in hopes of recouping its losses or buy it back, likely losing the $200 million they were owed in the process.

It is presently operational at the Severn Valley Railway. Career 21C127 was built in April 1946 at the SR's Brighton Works and was named Taw Valley, the name coming from the name of a river in Devon. She was originally allocated to Ramsgate followed by Exmouth Junction in 1947. In 1948 when British Railways was formed and the four pre grouping companys were merged into one she was renumbered from 21C127 to 34027. She was later rebuilt in 1957 to her current shape and was re-allocated to Brighton, and then followed by a transfer to Salisbury in 1963 where she was to remain for the rest of her days working for BR until August 1964 when she was withdrawn from service and towed to Barry Scrapyard. Naming Taw Valley was named after the river that flows through Devon and Dartmoor. She was one of thirty six \\"West Country\\" light pacific's to be named but not have a coat of arms applied during her service days, the coat of arms that she currently wears with her nameplate being post BR added in 2015 following the completion of her most recent overhaul. Withdrawal and preservation 34027 was withdrawn from service in August 1964 and was towed to Barry Scrapyard. She was rescued for preservation in 1980 by Bert Hitchen and was moved away from Barry Island to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where her restoration began, she was later moved to the East Lancashire Railway, but in August 1985 she was once again moved, to the Severn Valley Railway, where her restoration continued. Her restoration was completed in October 1987 and she then began her trial running, but did not enter service on the Severn Valley Railway until June 1988. Return to steam 34027's restoration from Barry Scrapyard condition was completed in October 1987 and following the completion of her running in period entered service on the Severn Valley Railway in June 1988, with a formal renaming ceremony taking place on 4 June that year. Alongside her work on the mainline she did put in mileage on the SVR until 1992 when she departed from the Railway. She returned to the SVR as a resident in 2001, when her owner Bert Hitchen put her up for sale and she was acquired by SVR member Phil Swallow. Following her withdrawal from the mainline she was disguised as scrapped sister 34036 Westward Ho Following an appearance at the SVR's Autumn Steam Gala in 2005 she was withdrawn from service requiring a complete overhaul. Taw Valley's most recent overhaul began in the spring of 2006. She was reunited with her boiler in time for the 2012 Autumn Steam Gala when newly allocated resident to the railway and classmate 34053 \\"Sir Keith Park\\" was running at the line's autumn steam gala. She was completed and run in in-time to haul an incoming \\"British Pullman\\" railtour on 16 May 2015 from Bewdley to Bridgnorth. The train, consisted of 10 Pullman coaches, 2 Mark 1 coaches and a Class 67 diesel. 34027 Taw Valley is the only operational steam loco on the railway (apart from 600 Gordon) to be equipped with air-braking to operate air-braked rolling stock. Mainline service Alongside being based on SVR her owner Bert decided to take her back out onto the mainline in 1989, and following a test run from Derby to Sheffield she became a regular mainline runner. She worked regular tours including \\"The North Wales Coast Express\\", \\"Welsh Marches Express\\" and \\"Cumbrian Mountain Express\\" from 1989 to 1994. Her most famous mainline duties included pulling the Venice-Simplon Orient Express on day trips from London to locations around the former southern region including Portsmouth. During this time she was based at Stewarts Lane TMD alongside fellow VSOE engine SR Merchant Navy class 35028 Clan Line. Beyond 2000, 34027 was still a regular runner on the mainline and for a brief period was painted maroon with Hogwarts Express nameplates to promote the Harry Potter series. It was suggested that she be used as the locomotive in the first film of the series when it was being worked on, but was rejected by films director Chris Columbus as she looked too modern; 5972 Olton Hall was chosen instead. She was then sold by Bert Hitchen to SVR-based member Phil Swallow, and mainline running continued until May 2005, when she was retired from the mainline and shortly afterwards retired for overhaul. During this time she was disguised as scrapped sister engines 34045 Ottery St Mary and 34036 Westward Ho. her owner had no plans to put 34027 back on the main line.

The historian Richard Pankhurst observed that early references to Axumite wine can be found in one of the stele erected by the 4th century ruler Ezana. Aksumite viticulture is also attested to by carvings on the base of the great 3rd century obelisk at Axum. The traditional honey wine tej has also long been widely popular. Contemporary viticulture in Ethiopia dates to 1956, to the establishment of the Awash Winery by entrepreneur Mulugeta Tesfakiros and Ras Mesfin Sileshi. As of 2014 the Awash winery had an annual output of 10 million bottles, most of which is consumed locally. In 2014 the French beverage corporation Castel began producing wines of a number of varieties on a 120-hectare estate near Ziway in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. As of 2013 annual production was 3 million bottles, approximately half of which was exported, mainly to China. Climatic and geographic conditions in the Rift Valley make it well suited to viticulture. Annual rainfall measures about 650 mm, temperatures average 25 degrees Celsius per year and the region enjoys sandy soils, which are ideal conditions for wine production. Furthermore, due to Ethiopia‚Äôs proximity to the equator, it is possible to make two harvests per year. The western slopes of the Ethiopian highlands also enjoy an inland Mediterranean climate, also conducive to wine-growing.

It is almost certain that Sumenu has to be identified with Imiotru () and thus also with the Crocodilopolis () which was distinct from the one in the Faiyum and, according to Strabo's Geographica, was located between Hermonthis (Armant) and Aphroditopolis (Gebelein).Strabo, Geographica, XVII, 47 It appears most likely that Sumenu was the toponym where the temple stood, while Imiotru/Crocodilopolis referred to the whole city; in later times, the \\"Sumenu\\" denomination became obsolete.Betr√≤, pp. 94-96 History Earliest attestations of Sumenu dates back to the 11th Dynasty, and consist in references of a temple of \\"Sobek, lord of Sumenu\\", indirectly attesting that such temple was already existing at the time. Jean Yoyotte suggested that the flourishing of the cult of Sobek during the Middle Kingdom was due to the Theban origin of the 12th Dynasty pharaohs rather than their interest in the Faiyum region where Sobek was later associated. In fact, objects referring to Sobek of Sumenu became quite common during the early Middle Kingdom, and was only with Amenemhat III that the cult of Sobek at Sumenu lost its appeal in favor of ‚ÄúSobek of Shedet‚Äù, the Greek Krokodeil√≥polis, located northward in the Faiyum.

She is best known for putting on alternative fashion shows meant to challenge the idea of beauty while empowering people living with disabilities. Early life and education Chalek was born in France and raised in the Paris suburbs of Seine-Saint-Denis. After secondary school, she enrolled at Paris V Descartes Law School. For her bachelor, she gained international experience and acquired a broader worldview through an international exchange student study program with the University of Laval. She then returned to France to study at the University of Paris graduating with a Masters in International Business Law. Career After graduating with her Masters of Law she went on to work with a variety of organizations and experienced the hierarchy that is common within the work space. Having an entrepreneurial spirit she knew that her next job must be her own. Chalek traveled to New York as an F1 student and was quickly offered a full time employment by the director of the school as a business Professor. Through her work at the business institute and New York's fashion industry she met various designers and learned about the process the designers go through in marketing their product. Designers have to work with all these different parties from marketing professionals to lawyers. This was often a daunting process especially for young designers just starting out and yet there was no single company with both the no how and network to guide them. Chalek saw this as an opportunity and decided to fulfill the designers' needs by starting her first company, Creative Business House. Now designers have someone who had the expertise in everything from marketing their product to protecting their intellectual property and other administrative aspects of the design business. As her business grew, Chalek found that the various event organizations that she worked with did not meet her needs or were beyond her clients budgets so she created the event company White Tie Affairs to work with Creative Business House clients. Word got out of her success and the philanthropic organization Association Let's Give a Chance offered her the position of vice president. Chalek took the offer and took it a step further by becoming one of its main benefactor partner. A year later she would extend this partnership further by launching \\"a physical annex in New York City under the name Do Not Be Cheap.\\" In April, 2018, Chalek traveled with non-profit organization, \\"Donnons Leur Une Chance\\" to distribute tools, sewing machines, and 1000 chickens to families living in poverty. International Dwarf Fashion Show One day when Chalek was shopping for clothes she noticed a woman of short stature in the children's section. The women did not have any children with her and appeared to be shopping for herself. The women was obviously frustrated and could not find any clothes that fit and were within her budget. Chalek later learned that the woman had a disability known as dwarfism, which affects around 30,000 people in the United States and is caused by a number of medical conditions and limits their height to no more than four feet ten inches. Like any disability, dwarfs are not only at risk for a range of medical problems but often are faced with limitations and discrimination. This limits their employment opportunities and forces many to get by on a meager income. With a limited income people living with dwarfism struggle to find clothes that fits. They can either go to a tailor to have custom-made apparel; shop in the children's department hoping to find something that fits them physically and emotionally as adults; or make their own clothes or alter oversized clothing. This forces them to invest a higher amount of money and time in obtaining well fitted clothes. Working for years in the fashion industry, Chalek knew that \\"fashion is about the garment, and not about the person wearing the garment\\". Chalek knew that the outfits created by the designers come in all types of shapes and sizes and but there a lot of discrimination within the industry and when it comes to hiring models to display the outfits they almost only hire models who are \\"tall and skinny\\". Myriam knew this was her chance to challenge the discrimination and idea of beauty and what it means to be beautiful. So utilizing her network within the fashion industry and driven by her need of philanthropy Chalek created The National Dwarf Fashion Show. In September 2014 The National Dwarf Fashion Show had its debut performance at the Pavillon Gabriel as part of Paris‚Äôs annual Fashion week.The event supposed to be a single event meant to put the spotlight on dwarfism, brought attention to the existing discriminations within the fashion industry and empowered women living with dwarfism. The event received press coverage and appealed to the Lifetime network producing the reality show Little Women New York who collaborated with Chalek to get a show as part of New York Fashion Week featuring Jordanna James of Little Women New York. In 2015, Berlin based fashion designer Sema Gedik learned about Myriam's alternative fashion shows that have been a part of Fashion Week in major cities like Tokyo(Paris and New York). Inspired by the concept, she held a small fashion show as a tribute to her cousin Gedik who was also living with dwarfism. The first international dwarf fashion show in Paris led the media to give an abundance of coverage to the event and during the 2015 Fashion Week in Paris the National Dwarf Fashion Show was invited to the French Ministry of Culture to support and promote alternative standards of beauty in an industry where the values of tall and thin are the norm. The International Dwarf Fashion Show is now more than a show but a group of individuals led by Chalek who strives to challenge the definition of beauty and empowers women living with dwarfism by taking part in fashion weeks in major cities including Tokyo and Dubai.  Blind Fashion Show  After success with the Dwarf Fashion Shows, Chalek, wanting to continue to orchestrate and plan activist fashion shows to raise awareness and empower other marginalized groups. In February 2016, New York Fashion Week came to a close with another activist fashion show this time using the fashion platform to shed light on the visually impaired community with the first ever fashion show consisting of all blind models. Although Chalek encountered some controversy as one of the criteria for models to apply was to walk without their guide dogs or canes, the visually impaired community was positively receptive to the show. After the success with New York's Fashion week, Chalek hosted a second blind fashion Show at the Pavillon Vendome as part of Paris's 2016 Fashion Week. The Show featured blind and visually impaired models Amongst them was 2012 Mrs America and Mrs. World pageant winner, April Lufriu who walked the runway with her daughter Savannah both who currently live with Retinitis Pigmentosa.  #MeToo Movement  After great success in using fashion as a means of raising awareness and empowering people living with disabilities, Chalek wanted to raise attention to sexual abuse. During the second night of New York 2018, she reignited the #MeToo slogan to show the world that sexual violence is also widespread and pervasive in the fashion and modeling industry so other survivors known they are not alone. On February 9, 2018 the #MeToo Fashion Show took place at The Green Room 42, in Manhattan. Chalek used her American Wardrobe label as a platform to benefit women. Eight models each survivors of rape, sexual harassment, child sexual abuse, groping and incest walked the runway wearing garments that represented their abuse. Each of the survivors walked accompanied by a male model wearing a pig mask which was an oblique reference to the #MeToo movement in France translated as #exposeyourpig. The male models were handcuffed to a chair as victims shared with the audience their experience as a victim of assault or/and sexual misconduct in ‚Äúvivid and disturbing detail‚Äù. Amongst the survivors, was Alicia Kozakiewiecz a young women who was abducted in 2002 near her Pittsburgh home.

S. Marble (later, Ella M. S. Tandberg; August 10, 18501929)Ella Marie Smith Tandberg at Find a Grave. was an American physician who worked as a journalist, educator, and activist earlier in her career. From girlhood, she took an active interest in any movement calculated to advance the interests of women. Interested in literary and philanthropic work, Marble served as president of the District of Columbia Federation Womans' Clubs, numbering ten societies and 2,500 members (\\"Pro Re Noto,\\" \\"Womans' National Press Association,\\" \\"Womans' Relief Corps,\\" \\"20th Century Club of Unitarian Church,\\" Civic Center,\\" \\"Ladies' Auxiliary Board of Emergency Hospital,\\" \\"Travel Club,\\" \\"Sons and Daughters of Maine,\\" \\"District Womans' Suffrage Association\\"); president, District Federal; vice-president, Womans' National Press Association for state of Maine; president, Minnesota State Suffrage Association; president, Minneapolis City Suffrage Association; president, Washington City Suffrage Association; Secretary, Pro Re Noto; and secretary, White Cross Society of Minneapolis. During these years Marble was public lecturer on philanthropic and educational topics; member of editorial staff of Washington daily paper in 1889; established the first gymnasium for women and children in Washington, D. C, in 1890; and graduated in medicine after raising a family and becoming a grandmother. Early years and education Ella Marie Smith was born in Gorham, Maine, August 10, 1850, the daughter of Stevens Smith and Sophia Ann Chadbourne. The mother died when Marble was nine years of age. She was her father's housekeeper from the age of 12 until she was 17. Living a rugged, healthful life during her girlhood days, Marble was educated in the common schools of her native town, and having completed that course, made her way through the village seminary and the Gorham Academy. Career An aptitude for study fitted her for teaching, and she taught and attended school alternately until she married, in 1870. Losing none of her interest in educational matters, she joined the Society for the Encouragement of Study at Home, conducted by a number of educated Cambridge, Massachusetts women, supplementing her studies by contributions to the leading papers and magazines of Maine and Massachusetts. In 1873, she accepted the editorial management of the juvenile department of a Maine paper. Failing health put a stop to her literary work for a time, and in search of health she moved to the West, spending five years in Kansas and Minnesota, devoting herself almost exclusively to philanthropic and educational work. She held at one time the offices of president of the Minnesota State Suffrage Association, president of the Minneapolis Suffrage Association, seven offices in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and secretary of the White Cross movement. She was also secretary and director of a maternity hospital, which she did much toward starting. She was one of the founders of the immense Woman's Christian Temperance Union Coffee Palace in Minneapolis. Receiving, in 1888, a flattering offer from a Washington D.C. daily newspaper, she moved to the Capital to take a position upon the editorial staff. She contributed also Washington letters to eastern and western papers. Notable literary work appeared in Kansas, Minneapolis, Boston, and Portland, Maine. Ella M. S. Marble Failing health caused her to abandon all literary work and engage in something more active, and she turned her attention to physical culture for women. She established, in 1889, the first women's gymnasium ever opened in Washington, D. C. She also established in connection with it an emporium for healthful dress, and found great pleasure in the fact that she had surrounded herself with two-hundred-fifty women and children who, as teachers, pupils and sewing-girls, were all looking to her to guide them toward health. In 1890, and again in 1891, she was made president of the District of Columbia Woman's Suffrage Association. She was several times called by the national officers to address the committees of the House and Senate. As a public speaker she was elective. Her wide experience in philanthropic work caused her to be called frequently to fill pulpits of both orthodox and liberal churches. In 1891, having made her school of physical culture a social and financial success, she sold it and accepted the financial agency of Wimodaughsis, the national woman's club. In Washington in 1890, Marble began medical school, matriculating at the National University, where she received three courses of lectures, graduating with honors in 1895 and at once beginning practice. She gave an address on \\"Women in Medicine\\" at the Atlanta Exposition. Personal life In 1870, she married Elmer Halsey Marble (1846-1893), of Paris, Maine.

Many of the tombs at Xanthos are pillar tombs, formed of a stone burial chamber on top of a large stone pillar. The body would be placed in the top of the stone structure, elevating it above the landscape. The tombs are for men who ruled in a Lycian dynasty from the mid-6th century to the mid-4th century BCE and help to show the continuity of their power in the region. Not only do the tombs serve as a form of monumentalization to preserve the memory of the rulers, but they also reveal the adoption of Greek style of decoration. Xanthos was chief city state governed by a king, who was under an Achaemenid Empire governor. The continuity of the dynastic rule in Xanthos was shown through a tradition of building pillar tombs. When these tombs were made, predominant Late Classical Greek ideas of art pervaded Lycian imagery. The tombs moved away from the local tradition and started to display the facades of pillared Greek Temples following the resurgence of Greek influence in the erea, from the 2nd quarter of the 4th century BCE (375-350 BCE). Several tombs were excavated by Sir Charles Fellows, an Englishman who excavated in the Levant and Asia Minor, and were transported to the British Museum in 1848 C.E.  Monumental pillar tombs   Lion Pillar  Lycian tomb in Xanthos. The ‚ÄúLion Pillar,‚Äù named because of the large lion in high relief, was located east of the Acropolis of Xanthos and stands around three meters high (around ten feet). The stone chest is made of white limestone, carved to fit the body. It has been postulated that this tomb was created between the early sixth century B.C.E. and the mid-sixth century B.C.E. Contrast is created between the high relief sculpture on the ends and the low relief sculpture in the center of the chest. The details of the friezes indicate that the craftsmen were Greek, not Lycian. The stylistic features that distinguish Greek craftsmanship are revealed through the depictions of the human form on the West side of the chest. A lion is held by a man, whose body simply delineated: nude and with few defining curves. His archaic smile and hair falling in locks also indicates a strong Archaic Greek style. On the south side of the front of the chest is the figure of a recumbent lion, carved in high relief. The lion is facing left, its body contained within the end of the block. The small head of a bull, who has been pinned by the lion, rests between its paws. Below the bull was a tablet, the inscription on which has faded. The North side of the monument features more imagery of lions, in a position of caring for young, as a lion interacts with her cubs. The carving technique used in this relief is similar to the one used on the South side of the frieze, with the details and outline of the form delineated by use of line. While the lion on the South side has weight and mass, the lion on the east side has a thinner form. On the east side of the monument, the composition is broken up into registers, the lower half remaining undecorated and the upper half most likely containing a low relief frieze. However, the complete length of the top frieze is unknown because part of it has broken off, limiting the information that can be gained from the images. On the left part of the east side of the monument, militaristic scenes in low relief depict soldiers with gear for war, including a shield, a Corinthian helmet, and a weapon. On the right side of the frieze is a horseman, dressed in a short cloak and a helmet, accompanied by an attendant wearing a chiton, a Greek-style tunic, carrying a spear. The unique iconography used in the monument has received much scholarly attention. It was meant to express legitimacy of the tomb's owner as well as his association to the Achaemenids. The Archaic pillar tomb itself, which is the oldest example of an architectural style unique to Lycia, alludes to his Lycian origin. Seyer concludes that the owner was probably a Lycian inaugurated as the first local ruler under the Achaemenids.  Harpy Tomb  The \\"Harpy Tomb\\" was most likely made around 480-470 B.C.E. The decorations are made in the Greek Archaic Style and the tomb was located on the Acropolis of Xanthos. The interpretation of the iconography of the ‚ÄúHarpy Tomb‚Äù have developed over time. Initially, it was believed that the winged females on the frieze referenced a myth about violence done to the Lycian royal family. Then, it was postulated that because the tomb was fabricated by Greek artisans and workmen, the imagery referenced a scene of the underworld, using iconography to underscore the funerary use of the structure. Tombs on mainland Greece produced at this time did not include the figures of gods, as are depicted, so a third theory was developed. The third theory is that the multiple generations of figures depicted around the image are an indication of hero worship centered around the individuals who could have been buried within the tomb.  Inscribed Pillar  The \\"Xanthian Obelisk\\" The Inscribed Pillar of Xanthos, also known as the \\"Xanthian Obelisk,\\" was made around 400 B.C.E. Like the other pillar tombs at Xanthos, the inscribed pillar supported a raised daise with a chamber tomb, decorated on the outside with friezes. Additionally, a statue of the occupant, a king in the Xanthian Dynasty, was positioned on top. The chamber tomb was surrounded by friezes depicting scenes from the life of the owner, including hunting and battle scenes. Seismic activity in antiquity likely caused the chamber tomb of fall off. The inscriptions on the side of the pillar provide room for scholarly speculation as to the creators of the monument. Greek and two different types of Lycian inscriptions mark the sides of the pillar, with each inscription addressing different topics. The Greek inscription is a dedication of the monument, likely to twelve Greek gods, and is the oldest Greek inscription known in Lycia. The inscriptions in Lycian B has not yet been fully deciphered, but the inscriptions in Lycian A, the last to be inscribed on the pillar, has been translated. The creator of the Inscribed Pillar is unknown, because several of the letters forming the individual's name in the Lycian inscription is missing.  Other monumental burials   Nereid Monument  The ‚ÄúNereid Monument‚Äù is another monumental tomb, named for the three figures of women between the columns on the front of the building. The tomb was built in the Ionic order (as the columns have volutes at tops and bases underneath them) and its form resembles an Ionic temple. The temple was built around 380 B.C.E. by Greek sculptors and architects. This funerary architecture parallels the religious architecture well-developed in Greece during the late Classical period. Just as the Nereid monument was influenced by Greek art and architecture, so too did it influence regional architecture after it. In fact, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was directly influenced by the Nereid Monument. Original podium of the Nereid Monument at Xanthos. The building and the podium it rests upon are covered in relief sculpture. The women who lend their title to the monument have been identified as Nereids, as they could have appeared to the Greeks, or as water nymphs who were part of a local Lycian cult. The ‚Äúhybrid iconography‚Äù present in the monument allows for multiple interpretations. The expression of power is a pervasive theme in the monument, despite being a tomb. The grand size and position within a dynastic tradition of pillar tombs helps to express the sources of power of the ruler, King Erbinna of the Xanthian Dynasty, buried within. Throughout the monument are many references to Erbinna's power, as the friezes depict both scenes of political development (court scene) as well as scenes of battle. On the podium, the iconography is mixed, utilizing Greek iconography on the bottom two friezes and the 8th to 7th century B.C.E. Assyrian iconography of power on the top two reliefs. Each set of friezes, in the podium, architrave, and interior, each show scenes of political life and recreation, as well as civic and religious duties.  Additional tombs  Other tombs were present at Xanthos. They include the \\"Pillar of the Wrestlers,\\" the \\"Theatre Pillar,\\" the \\"Acropolis Pillar,\\" and the \\"Tomb of Payava.\\"  Stylistic Influences  The tombs at Xanthos derived their form and decoration from multiple international sources. The form of the pillar tomb was a distinctively Lycian architectural type. Lycian, Greek, and Persian styles and iconographies combined in the relief sculpture of the tombs at Xanthos. Lycian imagery included predominant Late Classical Greek ideas of art such as a connection with the viewer, individualist expressions, centralized power and wealth, and new definitions of divinity. These themes can be seen through an examination of the relief sculpture of the monuments, specifically relating to the dynastic continuity between generations of Lycian rulers. Depictions of powerful individuals using styles from surrounding regions, even after the individuals's death, indicates cultural awareness and control. The tombs at Xanthos feature distinctive styles of relief sculpture that attest to the Greek influence in Anatolia during the Late Classical period. The use of Greek style in regions east of Greece are known as \\"East Greek\\" style. Some Greek stylistic influence was very direct, with some relief sculpture in Xanthos made by Greek artisans. Examples include the reliefs sculpture on the Nereid Monument and depictions of hunters and lions in the Greek Archaic style on the Lion Tomb. The Archaic style manifested itself in gridlike, proportional depictions of forms, not characterized by large amounts of movement. The Nereid Monument exemplifies the combination of Lycian, Greek, and Persian artistic styles because it combines Greek architectural forms and styles of motifs with Near Eastern iconography in the relief sculpture atop the Iconic-style pediment. ;Phoenicia The shape of the Lycian ogival tomb was adopted for the \\"Lycian\\" sarcophagus of Sidon, a tomb for a king of Phoenicia (modern Lebanon), built by Ionian artists circa 430-420 BCE. Indian architectural parallels The similarity of the tomb of Payava, and more generally the Lycian barrel-vaulted tombs, with the Indian Chaitya architectural design (starting from circa 250 BCE with the Lomas Rishi caves in the Barabar caves group) has also been remarked on. James Fergusson, in his \\" Illustrated Handbook of Architecture\\", while describing the very progressive evolution from wooden architecture to stone architecture in various ancient civilizations, has commented that \\"In India, the form and construction of the older Buddhist temples resemble so singularly these examples in Lycia\\". The Lycian tombs, dated to the 4th century BCE, are either free-standing or rock- cut barrel-vaulted sarcophagi, placed on a high base, with architectural features carved in stone to imitate wooden structures. There are numerous rock-cut equivalents to the free-standing structures. Both Greek and Persian influences can be seen in the reliefs sculpted on the sarcophagus.M. Caygill, The British Museum A-Z compani (London, The British Museum Press, 1999) E. Slatter, Xanthus: travels and discovery (London, Rubicon Press, 1994) A.H. Smith, A catalogue of sculpture in -1, vol. 2 (London, British Museum, 1900) The structural similarities, down to many architectural details, with the Chaitya-type Indian Buddhist temple designs, such as the \\"same pointed form of roof, with a ridge\\", are further developed in The cave temples of India. Fergusson went on to suggest an \\"Indian connection\\", and some form of cultural transfer across the Achaemenid Empire. The known Indian designs for the Chaityas only start from circa 250 BCE with the Lomas Rishi caves in the Barabar caves group, and therefore postdate the Xanthos barrel-vaulted tombs by at least one century. The Achaemenids occupied the northwestern parts of India from circa 515 BCE to 323 BCE following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley, before they were replaced with the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great and subsequent Hellenistic influence in the region. Art historian David Napier has also proposed a reverse relationship, claiming that the Payava tomb was a descendant of an ancient South Asian style, and that Payava may actually have been a Graeco-Indian named \\"Pallava\\".According to David Napier, author of Masks, Transformation, and Paradox, \\"In the British Museum we find a Lycian building, the roof of which is clearly the descendant of an ancient South Asian style.\\", \\"For this is the so-called \\"Tomb of Payava\\" a Graeco-Indian Pallava if ever there was one.\\" in \\"Masks and metaphysics in the ancient world: an anthropological view\\" in  References  Ancient Greek tombs Tombs in Turkey Lycia Archaeology of the Achaemenid Empire ","title":"Tombs at Xanthos"},{"id":"55149023","text":"Jos√© Francisco Agull√≥ Sevilla (born 1 June 1992), known as Jos√© Fran, is a Spanish footballer who plays as a left winger for CD Numancia.

Probably a husband and wife. Relief depicts one figure sitting and two others (a woman and a child) standing beside him. The Kerameikos steles are a collection of sculptures used as grave-markers (steles, sing. stele) in the Kerameikos necropolis of Attica. Kerameikos is located outside the Themistoclean Wall's Dipylon Gate. Stelai come in various shapes/designs and depict images varying from pottery to narrative scenes. They were often marble or limestone, and were carved or sculpted to depict the person being memorialized sometimes with relatives or slaves. Reliefs decorating the graves were meant to show the dead in their best light, using imagery to recognize their bravery in battle, or pathos, or wealth. These monuments marked the graves of Athenian men, fallen warriors, as well as non-citizens. Women were also included in Kerameikos but typically it was the wealthiest or prominent women who were given stele. In many vase paintings of grave scenes wreaths are seen resting at the base of stele. This was likely a popular way to adorn the graves of Greek loved ones.  History  The first steles were dated from the Early Bronze Age, around 2000 B.C. The use of steles as grave markers gained popularity in Kerameikos around the Protogeometric period c.a. 950 B.C.E. until they fell out of style around the 8th century C.E. The site was first excavated in 1870 by German archaeologists looking for grave-goods. Many of the fragments and inscriptions found in the present came from the remnants of the Themistoclean Walls, which were built after the Persian Wars, using any and all stone available. Many graves and buildings had been destroyed so they were used as building material.  Styles  Grave Stele of Dexileos. Athenians used Kerameikos for centuries to bury their dead. Over time different styles were introduced so there is a great variety of graves that came from Kerameikos. Notable styles found in Kerameikos include the naiskos stele, lekythos graves, and kore. Some grave- markers in Kerameikos were set with high bases for sculptures that could be seen from afar, such as the burial monument of Dionysios of Kollitos or the recumbent bull in the British Museum.British Museum Collection Graves were inscribed with the name of the deceased and where they came from. Some steles at Kerameikos used a style known as naiskos (\\"small temple\\"), which looks like a temple with columns and a pediment at the top. This particular symbol of wealth gained popularity in the 5th century B.C. examples include the Grave Stele of Dexileos and the Grave Stele of Hegeso.  Notable burials and graves  After the Battle of Chairon and Thibrachos, Lacedaemonian soldiers of King Pausanias' army were buried at Kerameikos. The tomb was found marked by a marble plinth with Lacedaemonian inscriptions of the names of the men. Lekythos vase depicting a woman visiting a stele grave and carrying with an offering for the gods. Note the wreath decoration. The Grave Stele of Hegeso is one of the best-preserved surviving attic stele and features a woman seated by her servant. This grave is a naiskos, meaning Hegeso was likely a prominent woman as this style signified wealth and importance.Mitchell, L.M.W. (1905). A History of Ancient Sculpture.

For example, a match might have players with surnames beginning A to K on one side and players with surnames beginning L to Z on the other. It is possible that other similar matches were played to c.1825 but, if so, the records have not survived. The idea has not been repeated at first-class level since 1833. 1786 In August 1786, a match at Moulsey Hurst was played between teams from Hampshire (organised by the Hambledon Club) and Kent, the venue in Surrey being neutral. The main source for the match is Arthur Haygarth's Scores & Biographies (S&B;). Haygarth reports a curiosity in that the Kent XI \\"consisted entirely of A's, B's and C's\\" and he says that, \\"in another account\\" (possibly Grand Matches of Cricket 1771 to 1791 by W. Epps), \\"the two sides are called A, B and C's v. the rest of the Alphabet\\".Haygarth, S&B; volume 1, p. 67. Haygarth, who often complained in S&B; about inconsistent titling of matches, adds that the Hambledon Club's Old Scores scorebook calls the match \\"Earl of Winchilsea's Side\\" versus \\"Sir Horace (Horatio) Mann's Side\\" but he rejects this and states that \\"it is decidedly a match between Hambledon Club (Hampshire) and Kent\\". His title is \\"Hambledon Club, with Lumpy versus Kent, with Bedster\\". In its Important Matches guide, the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) calls the match \\"ABC v Rest of Alphabet\\".ACS, Important Cricket Matches, p. 26. CricketArchive agrees with the ACS and has called the match \\"A to C v Rest of the Alphabet\\". Haygarth is not entirely correct in his analysis of the two teams because Hambledon included four players from elsewhere and Kent two. Lumpy Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey was, as Haygarth says, a \\"given man\\" on the Hambledon/Hampshire side but, in addition, the team included Earl of Winchilsea (White Conduit Club), Edward Hussey (Kent) and William Fennex (Middlesex). The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex. The other nine were usually associated with Kent: Stephen Amherst, James Aylward (though he played for Hampshire until 1779), Francis Booker, John Boorman, William Bowra, William Brazier, William Bullen, Robert Clifford and Henry Crozoer. 1787 to 1789 According to CricketArchive (CA), teams called \\"A to M\\" and \\"N to Z\\" played each other five times in three seasons from 1787. The main secondary source for the five matches is again S&B; which calls the two teams \\"Earl of Winchilsea's Side\\" and \\"Sir Horace (Horatio) Mann's Side\\". There is nothing in S&B; to suggest that the teams were organised alphabetically. Furthermore, the so-called \\"A to M\\" teams included Tom Taylor and the \\"N to Z\\" included James Aylward and William Fennex. CA claims that these were \\"given men\\" and also that the two patrons evidently alternated between the teams, which would put Winchilsea into \\"A to M\\" and Mann into \\"N to Z\\". The S&B; version is supported by the ACS.Haygarth, S&B; volume 1, pp. 77‚Äì91ACS, Important Cricket Matches, p. 27. 1831 to 1833 Two A to K versus L to Z matches were played in 1831 and 1833. These were genuine alphabetical matches. They were both played at Lord's by teams of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) members supplemented by leading professionals including Jem Broadbridge, William Lillywhite, Fuller Pilch and Ned Wenman. The 1833 match was 12-a-side.Haygarth, S&B; volume 2, p. 152.Haygarth, S&B; volume 2, p. 213.

History Krukut river has the upstream at Situ Citayam, Depok, West Java, and today it ends near Karet area, merging into \\"Banjir Kanal Barat\\", with a total length of 84.4 kilometer, of which about 30 kilometer is the main river. The downstream of Krukut river has caused severe flooding in Jakarta since 1890. The intermittent widening, digging and straightening of the flow in the decades managed to partially tame some parts. However, in August 2016, the luxurious and also iconic area of South Jakarta, Kemang, was inundated by the overflow of Krukut, after some protecting walls were damaged due to unprecedented high discharge. Other incidents were regularly reported from Kebalen to Pondok Labu in South Jakarta. In early 1970s, the width of Krukut was about 25 meter, and deeper than normal human height. Its flow was a source of irrigation for rice fields and fish farming. No housing was allowed to built as this was a designated water flow area. However, since then many buildings were illegally erected along the banks, and the people threws household trash in the river, that even after the cleaning in 2017, the width of Krukut became as narrow as 1.5 meter in some points (according to Iskandar, the head of Balai Besar Wilayah Sungai Ciliwung-Cisadane/BBWSCC). Actually, a small stream of Krukut reappears about 300 meter from the confluence with Banjir Kanal Barat, at the administrative village of Kebon Melati, with the width of 3 meter, known locally as \\"Old Krukut\\" (\\"Krukut Lama\\") or \\"Lower Krukut\\" (\\"Krukut Bawah\\"). This stream meanders 31.4 kilometer before merging into Kali Pakin at Krukut area, West Jakarta, then into \\"Kali Besar\\" and finally reaching the Pluit Dam at Pintu Air Pasar Ikan, indirectly discharged into Jakarta Bay.

Normalisation  The normalisation of Krukut river started in the era of Governor Ali Sadikin, 1966-1977, to include the straightening of the flow, cutting problematic river bends and removing small sedimentation islands in the stream. This project was part of flood handling strategy, involving the removal of some 8,000 people from the housing on the river banks of Kali Krukut Cideng canal (Kompas, 21 February 1971). In 2010, the government ordered the digging of the river, removing 1000 cubic meter of mud in a stretch of 1.1 km. This was accompanied by cleaning the blocked drains and educating local people about sanitary and river maintenance.Pengerukan Kali Krukut Guna Hasilkan Air Bersih.

Along with 1937's In Parenthesis, it is the text upon which Jones' reputation largely rests. Summary The poem is composed of eight sections, which together narrate the thought processes of one cambrophile English Catholic at Mass over the span of roughly seven seconds. Section I: \\"Rite and Fore-time\\" begins during a mid-twentieth century Mass, but quickly shifts to contemplate prehistoric ritual and myth-making. In the following sections, \\"Middle-sea and Lear-sea\\", \\"Angle-Land\\", and \\"Redriff\\", Jones' poem considers the theme of nautical navigation. Throughout, several ships in distinct historical periods sail westward from Troy to Rome (following the fall of Troy), then around Western Europe to the English coast (ca. 400AD), and finally to London via the Thames (mid-nineteenth century). Section V, \\"The Lady of the Pool\\", is an extended monologue of sorts given by one Elen/Helen/Helena/Eleanore, a personification of the city of London, in the mid-fifteenth century. In section VI, \\"Keel, Ram, Stauros\\", the ship(s) we have been following explicitly becomes the World Ship, with the divine Logos for keel, and the Cross (stauros) as a mast. Finally, section VII, \\"Mabinog's Liturgy\\", concerns the Mediaeval Welsh celebration of Christmas Mass, while section VIII, \\"Sherthursdaye and Venus Day\\", centres on The Last Supper and Crucifixion. While in this brief summary and indeed upon first reading the poem's structure may seem chaotic, Thomas Dilworth has celebrated The Anathemata's wide-open form as unique in being formally whole. Dilworth notes that the structure produced by Jones' poetry is a \\"symmetrical multiple chiasmus,\\" evident in Jones' manuscripts of the poem from its inception. He then provides the following illustration of its form: ((((((((O)))))))) Allusions \\"Anathemata\\" is Greek for \\"things set apart,\\" or \\"special things.\\" In lieu of any coherent plot, notes William Blissett, the eight sections of Jones' poem repeatedly revolve around the core history of man in Britain \\"as seen joyfully through Christian eyes as preparation of the Gospel and as continuation of Redemption in Christendom, with the Sacrifice of Calvary and the Mass as eternal centre.\\" This revolving structure reflects Jones' belief that cultural artefacts of the past lived on within specific cultures in a continuous line of artistic interpretation. As such, the text is densely allusive, and moves freely between old/middle/early modern/modern English, Welsh, and Latin. In this respect, it is similar to The Cantos of Ezra Pound, or James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, and can confuse and mislead the over-attentive but impatient reader. Criticism Thomas Dilworth has asserted that the reason that Jones' poetry is not widely read today is the \\"general neglect of The Anathemata.\\" Despite this, the poem was well received by Jones' fellow poets. For example, W.H. Auden has described it as \\"very probably the finest long poem written in English this century,\\" and T.S. Eliot felt that it secured Jones' status‚Äîalong with Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and Eliot himself‚Äîas a master of English Modernism. John Berryman of the New York Times Book Review gave the poem a glowing review, calling it \\"sinewy, inventive, sensitive, vigorous, devoted, not at all a crackpot or homiletic operation. (...) I will not call it parasitic, for it enjoys its own materials; but is it epiphytic ? Here is where criticism of the brilliant thing must begin.\\" Finally, the Times Literary Supplement also gave a favourable review, but also accurately forecasted Dilworth's lament that it would be ignored: the text \\"bristles with too many arcane allusions for a reader to grasp the meaning within its magic without a great deal of that 'mugging-up' which shatters the poetic illusion.\\" References Books by David Jones 1952 books Epic poems in English 1952 poems ","title":"The Anathemata"},{"id":"55149359","text":"The Ministry of Defence Main Building or MOD Main Building, also known as MOD Whitehall or originally as the Whitehall Gardens Building, is a grade I listed government office building located on Whitehall in London. The building was designed by E. Vincent Harris in 1915 and constructed between 1939 and 1959 on the site of the Palace of Whitehall. It was initially occupied by the Air Ministry and the Board of Trade before in 1964 becoming the current home of the Ministry of Defence. By the 1990s the building was no longer considered fit for purpose and had become expensive to maintain. A major refurbishment was therefore undertaken between 2000 and 2004 through a contract under the private finance initiative.  Location  alt=Map of Whitehall showing the MOD Main Building in relation to other government buildings and the River Thames. Comprising a site of , the building is located on Whitehall within the City of Westminster, central London. Whitehall is lined with numerous government departments and offices and is close to the Houses of Parliament. Whitehall is located to the west. Between Whitehall and Main Building is Banqueting House which is the only remaining component of the Palace of Whitehall. To the north is Horse Guards Avenue. The street is home to Whitehall Court and also the Old War Office building which was formerly government offices but is now earmarked for conversion to a hotel after being sold to developers in 2016. The building is separated from Victoria Embankment and the River Thames to the east by public gardens known as Whitehall Gardens. Richmond Terrace is to the south and is now used as a private car park, although a public pedestrian route is maintained. Adjacent to Richmond Terrace is the Curtis Green Building, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service since November 2016 and otherwise known as New Scotland Yard. The Department of Health occupies the neighbouring building, Richmond House. The building is located within the Whitehall Conservation Area, and was identified by Westminster City Council as a landmark building within their 2003 audit of the conservation area.  Early history   Previous use of site  The building is located on the site of the Palace of Whitehall, which was the main residence of the English monarchs in London from 1530 until 1698 when most of its structures were destroyed by a fire. Despite some rebuilding, financial constraints prevented large scale reconstruction. In the second half of the 18th century, much of the site was leased for the construction of town houses. By the early 19th century some of the Georgian town houses were occupied as government offices.  Design and construction  In 1909 a decision was taken to construct a new significant government building on the Whitehall Gardens site, primarily to be used by Board of Trade. Architect E. Vincent Harris, OBE, RA, won a national competition in 1915 to design the building. The selected site was proposed to extend over Whitehall Gardens and also on ground adjacent to Victoria Embankment; however, opposition to this idea led to the southern building-line extending no further than that of the neighbouring Whitehall Court and National Liberal Club buildings to the north. This resulted in a reduction of proposed floor space of approximately . Due to the outbreak of the First World War the start of work was delayed. In 1933 the Office of Works issued a requirement for a significantly larger building and Harris was again selected as architect. The building was to be a single block in the Neoclassical design, faced in Portland stone, some high and long with a depth of , widening to feet. It was to be formed as four internal blocks of ten storeys surrounding three internal courtyards with the two main elevations facing Whitehall and the Victoria Embankment. Work was again delayed due to the interwar economic depression. However, activity started on site in 1938 when town houses in Whitehall Gardens were demolished. Five rooms from Pembroke House, Cromwell House and Cadogan House were dismantled and incorporated into the building as conference rooms. The rooms are now known as the \\"Historic Rooms\\" and are located on the third and fourth floors (see Historic Rooms section). Henry VIII's wine cellar beneath Main Building. Due to the wishes of Queen Mary and after providing assurances to Parliament, arrangements were made for the preservation of a 16th-century Tudor brick- vaulted wine cellar which had originally been located in Cadogan House, the York Place home of Cardinal Wolsey. The long and wide cellar consists of 10 bays with 4 octagonal piers and had been incorporated into Whitehall Palace by Henry VIII. The cellar was similar in design and construction to the wine cellar at Hampton Court, featuring brick with stone dressings. Prior to the redevelopment of the site it had been used as a luncheon room by the Ministry of Transport. The existing position of the cellar was not compatible with the plans for the new building so it was decided to move it so it could be incorporated into the basement. Construction progress on the building was short-lived as work largely stopped at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Work recommenced at the end of hostilities and in 1949 the wine cellar was encased by the contractor, Trollope & Colls, in protective layers of concrete, steel and brick and placed on mahogany cushions, carriage rails and steel rollers. It was then moved to one side onto a specially designed steel frame so that a hole could be created on its original site. The 1,000 ton structure was lowered on screwjacks, and then moved back to its final position.  Opening and operational use  The east elevation of the building with the River Thames in the foreground.In 1951 the northern end of the building was ready for occupation by the Board of Trade. The Air Ministry took occupation of the southern part of the building when it was completed in 1959. The Whitehall Gardens Building, as it was known when it opened, was Harris' last major work and the last significant neoclassical style government building. The September 1951 edition of Building praised the new building; however, it became known as the 'Whitehall Monster' and was described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as a 'monument of tiredness'. In 1964, the former incarnation of the Ministry of Defence, the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry, were all combined to form the modern Ministry of Defence. This move generated a requirement for a single large building to accommodate staff for the new ministry and the Whitehall Gardens Building was identified as the preferred option, with the Board of Trade moving to the Victoria area of London. A short-list of names for the new headquarters comprised \\"The Mall\\", \\"Whitehall Building\\" and, the eventual winner, \\"Main Building\\". On 14 January 1970 the building was grade I listed by English Heritage as a building of exceptional interest.  Redevelopment   Contract  MOD Main Building prior to redevelopment. Note the three internal courtyards which were yet to be covered. As early as 1990 the MOD recognised that the condition of Main Building was no longer fit for modern business requirements. Maintenance had become expensive and inefficient and the building no longer met modern safety standards. At the same time, the MOD was seeking to reduce the number of staff it had within London so that it could make savings by reducing the number of buildings it occupied. The decision was therefore made to redevelop Main Building and a 30 year long private finance initiative (PFI) contract for the redevelopment and ongoing maintenance & facilities management of the building was awarded in May 2000. The contract also included the refurbishment, maintenance and running of three central London MOD offices (Northumberland House, Metropole Building and St Giles' Court) to temporarily accommodate staff decanted from Main Building during the redevelopment. The capital expenditure involved was ¬£531 million. The contract winner, Modus, is a consortium consisting of Innisfree PFI Funds (40.1% shareholding), Laing Investments (40.1%) and Amey Ventures (19.9%). HOK was selected as architecture and interior design consultant, Alan Baxter as structural engineers and WSP as mechanical & electrical engineers. Kv√¶rner Construction were the main construction contractor; however, in August 2000 Kv√¶rner was bought over by Swedish multinational Skanska.  Construction  Military and civilian staff within an atrium area at Main Building.The decant of staff to other buildings was completed in August 2001. In September of that year a ceremony took place to mark the commencement of works when Skanska Construction‚Äôs CEO Keith Clarke and Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Sir Michael Boyce assisted Secretary of State for Defence Geoff Hoon to demolish a wall of his old office. The redevelopment saw the existing cellular room layout changed into an open-plan office layout to improve collaboration between staff and the working environment. All mechanical and electrical services were upgraded along with IT networks. New communal spaces were created including a library, restaurant, coffee shop, business & press suite and cr√®che. The internal courtyards were enclosed to create three new atria within the building. Security and anti-terrorism measures were integrated into the building, with the MOD changing such requirements after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Original historic features of the building were protected and restored during the redevelopment, such as the replacement of oak doors and terrazzo marble floor of the Pillared Hall. All 2,494 metal windows in the building were refurbished and repaired. The capacity of the building was increased by the redevelopment from 2,800 to 3,300 staff. This allowed the MOD to dispose of five buildings in central London, these being Northumberland House, the Metropole Building, Great Scotland Yard, St. Giles Court and St Christopher House. The building was handed back to the MOD in July 2004 and re-occupation by 3,150 staff was completed in September 2004, two months ahead of schedule.  Controversy  The Ministry of Defence plaque outside the south door of Main Building. The MOD were accused of excessive spending on the redevelopment project. Specific allegations included the cost of Herman Miller Aeron office chairs which had a retail price of ¬£1,050 each, lavish spending on the refurbishment of historic features and the provision of staff facilities including the coffee shop, restaurant and quiet rooms. In response the MOD said that chairs were purchased at a large discount (approximately a third of the normal price); many of the aspects of the refurbishment relating to historic features were required by English Heritage, reflecting the building's grade I listed status; and that staff facilities were generally not subsidised, were required to ensure an acceptable level of staff welfare and to provide a suitable working environment. In April 2002, whilst redevelopment was still under way, the National Audit Office (NAO) considered the extent to which the PFI contract was likely to deliver value for money and the effectiveness of MOD's management of the project. The NAO report was generally favourable and found that the contract will provide what the MOD wished to procure, that the benefits of the contract will be similar in cost to that estimated for conventional procurement (other factors had tipped the balance in favour of PFI) and that the management of the project had been good. A subsequent report by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in January 2003 was less favourable. The committee was critical of the MOD's choice of PFI over other forms of procurement and considered that there was no guarantee that the contract, valued at ¬£2.4 billion over its lifetime, will deliver value for money. The report also criticised the MOD for delays in concluding the final contract which resulted in increased costs and for poor forward planning, which resulted a separate deal being required to accommodate 500 additional staff in London.  Architectural features   Architectural sculpture  Earth and Water, located at the northern entrance. The northern tetrastyle portico entrance to the building, on Horse Guards Avenue, is flanked by two large statues, Earth and Water, by the sculptor Sir Charles Wheeler. The figures weigh 40 tonnes each and cost ¬£12,600. Similar figures representing \\"air\\" and \\"fire\\" were intended to be installed at the south end of the building; however, these were never constructed. During the 1950s, building staff nicknamed the statues \\"Mr and Mrs Parkinson\\", after Cyril Northcote Parkinson, the Board of Trade civil servant who devised Parkinson's Law which states \\"work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion\\". More recently MOD staff refer to the statues as the \\"two fat ladies\\". The badge of the RAF is carved into stone columns either side of the southern entrance to the building, reflecting its initial use by the Air Ministry. The badge, featuring an Eagle superimposed on a circlet which is surmounted by a crown, was sculpted by David McFall.  Statues  Several military statues exist in the grounds of the building or in close proximity. * A statue of Major General Gordon of Khartoum dating from 1887‚Äì1888, sits at the Horse Guards Avenue end of Whitehall Gardens. The grade II listed statue by Sir Hamo Thornycroft is made from bronze and sits on a Portland stone base. * Marshal of the RAF The 1st Viscount Trenchard (1873-1956) is commemorated by a 1961 bronze statue situated in Whitehall Gardens. * The RAF Memorial dating from 1923 is located at the Whitehall Steps on Victoria Embankment. Designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield and sculpted by Sir William Reid Dick, the memorial is constructed from Portland stone and features a gilt bronze eagle. * Whitehall Gardens features the Fleet Air Arm Memorial designed by James Butler. It was unveiled on 1 June 2000 by Charles, Prince of Wales.  Historic Rooms  Five rooms from buildings which were previously on the site were dismantled and incorporated into the building as conference rooms when the building was originally built. They are now known as the \\"Historic Rooms\\". * Historic Room No.13 dates from around 1757 and was a reception room from Pembroke House. It features a decorative plaster ceiling with modillion cornicing. There is an Ionic columned and pilastered framed alcove and female mask keystone within the arch beneath entablature and flanking bays. There are 6-panel doors placed on circular panels. * Historic Room No. 24 dates from 1757 and was also part of Pembroke House. It is similar to room no.13, but has an elaborated alcove opposite a bay window in three part arrangement with decorative doors on each side in a frame of fluted Ionic columns sitting on pedestals. There is a decorative plasterwork ceiling with spider's web design and modillion cornicing and a carved arabesque ornamented window shutter panels. * Historic Room No. 25 is the former dining room from Pembroke House. It dates from 1773 and was designed by Sir William Chambers and features a decorated plasterwork ceiling and an elaborate chimneypiece designed by William Kent, which is believed to originate from Cadogan House. * Historic Room No. 27 is the former saloon of Pembroke House and dates from 1760. It was also designed by Sir William Chambers and features an elaborate Palladian style compartmented plasterwork ceiling and Corinthian columned and pedimented doorway with carved detailing. * Historic Room No. 79 was formerly part of Cromwell House and dates from around 1722. It is a completely panelled room with decorated modillion cornicing, the north wall featuring elaborated carved architrave central panel, the east wall has a formerly open three part pilastered arcade and an ornate carved pine chimneypiece. There are consoles supporting the mantle, carved with eagle heads and a pedimented overmantel.  Facilities  Beneath Main Building is a three-storey bunker complex housing the Defence Crisis Management Centre (DCMC), otherwise known as \\"Pindar\\" after the ancient Greek poet. The DCMC provides the government with a protected crisis management facility. Government ministers, senior military and civilian personnel, service and civilian operational and support staff are allocated space within the complex. The DCMC cost ¬£126.3 million to construct and fit- out and became operational on 7 December 1992.  Security  On 1 June 2007 the building was designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to trespass into the building. The restriction also includes the wall and vehicle ramps on the west side of the building adjoining Whitehall Gardens and Raleigh Green; however, it does not include the steps, ramps and porticos that give access to the inside of the building. In August 2016, The Times newspaper reported that the specialist armed unit of the Ministry of Defence Police which guards Main Building could cease to carry out such duties. The MOD would only confirm that it was reviewing security arrangements at Main Building.

Stelai in Ancient Greece were used almost in the same manner as modern tombstones, commemorating the dead. They were made of stone or marble, mainly. They often either showed scenes from the deceased's life, or a mythological scene. The use of stelai in Ancient Greece have been observed dating back to the bronze age. Demetrias was a favorite residence of the kings of Macedon, which is a reason as to why the Hellenistic style was so prevalent in Demetrias.  Funerary stelai   Aphrodeisia, Daughter of Theudotos  A painted stele depicting Aphrodeisia, daughter of Theudotos. This Stele was discovered in Magnesia and is determined to date back to 276-168 BCE. It is made of marble, and is meant as a memorial to Aphrodeisia. The top of the stele is an inscription informing the reader that the painting below is of Aphrodeisia. Aphrodeisia is wearing a blue/green chiton and sitting on a chair, being offered jewelry, which she is accepting. It is not clear the context of the situation, but she may be at her wedding due to the dress. It is currently on display in V√≥los, Thessaly, Greece.  Stele of the \\"Warriors\\"  Stele of the Warriors This partial stele is not in as good condition as the Aphrodeisia stele, but it still provides detail about hellenistic culture and what funerary stelai could have represented. The white marble stele, discovered in Magnesia, shows two men, most likely soldiers. They are thought to be soldiers because of the clothing of the sitting man, which is brought up above his knees, and the spears the men are carrying. It is impossible to determine who these warriors are, as their entire top halves are missing. The standing man is nude, and is also carrying a dagger.

The game was released in the English, Italian, French, German and Spanish languages. It was planned to be ported to Amiga by December, but ultimately that was never released. Plot The game's plot is inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos. In Ancient Egypt, dark worshippers contained some evil spells inside an ancient scroll to unleash monsters upon the world. In Alexandria in the 1920s, the scroll is given to the player by a strange lady. Gameplay Before starting the game, the player can select one out six playable characters or customize one. A customized character can be either gender, with a profile inputted, one of two nationalities and a choice from six classes each with four or five skills. The character stats will determine what puzzles the player can solve in the game. The player's starting inventory consists of a diary, a map, some petty cash, a cookbook and a guidebook. The CD version only allows two different playable characters to be chosen each with a different adventure in the game; Matthew Faulkner the Egyptologist and an Occultist. Unlike the Floppy version, the player must acquire the map, cookbook and guidebook rather than start with them. Development Keith Hook programmed the game engine SIGNOS (Scripted Interactive Graphic Novel Operating System). The lead artist Pete Lyon visited Egypt before he worked on the graphics to implement realism in the game. Richard Edwards ensured that all graphics were accurate to the time period of the game.

Established in Villefranche-de-Lauragais, where he had early acquired a certain political influence in republican circles, he was named after the Revolution of 1830 Commander of the National Guard; but seeing that the government was embarking on a course which was not his, he resigned. Godefroy remained close, intellectually and politically, to his uncle Jean-Marie, and this, despite the fact that the royalists condemned him to exile and banished him from the national territory in 1816, as a regicide, during the restoration of Monarchy. A letter written from Li√®ge in 1833 by the former conventional and deputy to the Council of the Five-Hundred, and addressed to his nephew Godefroy, explicitly testifies about the proximity of their common republican convictions.The extract from the following letter (sent from Li√®ge on October 21, 1833 addressed by Jean-Marie Cal√®s to his nephew, Godefroy) gives an interesting piece of information about the life he lived in Li√®ge. One can see that the former member of the Convention had not, like so many of his colleagues, repudiated his democratic principles. ¬´ To Monsieur Cal√®s, doctor of medicine, in Villefranche-de-Lauragais, through Toulouse, France. My dear friend. Your letter, full of wit and sparkling with gaiety, gives me the greatest pleasure; you remind me of the mischievousnesses of my youth, of which I do not repent; they made me laugh before, why should they make me cry now? I shall never forget that they made me bear without difficulty the misery, which continually heaped on me, that they have softened the bitterness which the exercise of medicine entails with it, a divine art in itself, yet detestable for him who exercises it. The uneducated public, the ignorant confreres, jealous and envious, give a thousand disgusts to the educated practitioner; I know that we can gain by it over all of that; but we feel some anguish, which we bear with difficulty. You tell me that a nobleman has vexed you because you were my parents: that does not astonish me from him; it is a caste so low, so ill-educated, that one can expect of it only the fruits of ignorance and prejudice. I am sure that the idiot who vexed you, if he lost his place, is as flat today as he was arrogant then. I have seen nobles of another flock, such as the Bethune-Sully, the Lagrange, the Nivernais, the Rohan, honoring themselves to be as sentinels at my door, and lavishing upon me the testimonies of the most adulatory sentiments, down to baseness. I‚Äôm citing this to prove you that these nobles have no nobility and, as long as this caste will exist, it will be the misfortune of France. I do not wish it to be annihilated, but I would have it put into the inability to harm. Here is my position in Li√®ge. After living in Munich and Basel, in Switzerland, I came to Li√®ge fifteen years ago. The police commissioner Wassin confused me with my brother Chrysost√¥me [Jean-Chrysost√¥me Cal√®s, A.N.], with whom he had served, and proposed me to remain at Li√®ge. The plan of the Bourbons was to push us until Siberia, and a safe asylum was, then, a treasure. I found it here. I first occupied myself to make theses for the candidates in medicine, which produced me twelve hundred francs a year. Soon after, a few cures, which made a certain noise, attracted to me a prodigious number of patients, but because I was not a Belgian doctor, I decided to give consultations at my house and I refused to go to see the patients, excepted only if I would be called in consultation by doctors, what happens sometimes. There are no important people who had not come to me yet, and the public has followed their example, which has given me some consideration. As I helped and pleased a lot of people, everyone tries to help me. Everything I do is free; a sober life puts me above any need and with a small income I look like a rich man. Embrace for me my sisters. The eldest [Marie-√âtiennette Pujol, born Cal√®s, A.N.] first had the courage to write to me before the end of my exile. I am grateful to her. Justine [Marie-Justine Pujol, born Cal√®s, A.N.], whom I left as a child, always had my friendship. I thank you for giving me news of her. [...] All yours. Cal√®s. A thousand greetings to your wife [L√©onie-Alphonsine-Zulm√©e Cal√®s, born Metg√©, A.N.], of which you do not speak and to your little boy [Jean-Jules-Godefroy Cal√®s, born in 1828, then 5 years-old in 1833.

A pioneering doctor on the study of pellagra  Dr. Cal√®s was one of the first doctors who identified pellagra in France, from 1822,¬´ What is the time when pellagra has claimed the most victims in southwestern France? The details were missing to answer this question back in 1845. The earliest evidence that I had collected was that of M. Gaultier de Claubry, who stated that he had observed a case in the region of the Landes in 1809. ¬´ It is, said I, only in 1829, that Mr. Hameau reported the 'Mal de la Teste', that he observed since 1818. It was not until 1845 that we were informed of the existence of the disease in the departments of the Haute- Garonne and Aude where MM.

This disease, which has become rare in developed countries, is due to malnutrition and is manifested by dermatitis, diarrhea and, in the most severe cases, dementia. In the absence of treatment, the outcome is death. It reaches poor populations whose diet contains little tryptophan and Vitamin B3 (Niacin, Vitamin PP), as in the case of non-nixtamalized maize diets. The observations and works of Cal√®s made in Villefranche-de-Lauragais served as a foundation for the subsequent work of the doctor, philanthropist and politician Th√©ophile Roussel (of the Academy of Medicine) who will contribute to publicize the disease in France, by the publication in 1845 of ¬´ De la pellagre ¬ª,¬´ De la pellagre ¬ª Th√©ophile Roussel, [Th√®se de M√©decine, Paris, 1845], Paris, Imp.

Poser, in Science History Publications/USA, 2003 Thus, Roussel undertook a study trip to the South-West of France in 1847 and visited Dr. Cal√®s in Villefranche to better understand this terrible plague.¬´ When my work on pellagra appeared in 1845, the existence of this disease in the countryside of the former county of Lauraguais had just been revealed by a published article (Journal de med. De Bordeaux, May 1844) by Mr. Dr. Roussilhe, of Castelnaudary, and by an interesting letter addressed to me by Dr. Cal√®s, of Villefranche, which I published in my work. To this information, I added a very imperfect note on the medical topography of Lauraguais. Two years later, having received the mission of studying pellagra in the south of France, I went first to Castelnaudary, where I arrived on 1 September (1847). I went through the part of Lauraguais which belongs to the department of Aude, then that which depends on the Haute-Garonne. Welcomed by MM. Roussilhe and Cal√®s, with a kindness which seventeen years since then have not effaced the memory, I was accompanied by them to their patients. ¬ª In ¬´ Trait√© de la pellagre et des pseudo-pellagres ¬ª (Treatise on pellagra and pseudo-pellagres, \\" Work crowned by the Institute of France, Academy of Sciences, meeting of February 6, 1865\\"), p.383: Chapter: De la pellagre en France (Of pellagra in France); II. - Histoire de la pellagre dans le Lauraguais (Aude et Haute-Garonne) (History of pellagra in the Lauraguais (Aude and Haute-Garonne)), by Th√©ophile Roussel, ed.

After the categorical confession of impotence [of Therapeutic Agents, A.N.] which has been formulated above in terms so expressive: ¬´ I do not pretend, ¬ª said the honorable doctor of Villefranche, ¬´ that the therapeutic agents have no action; but, forced to accept our patients with their misery, we are confessing our failures. I have obtained satisfactory results only in those who have been placed under the influence of better hygiene. The main means used by us are: baths, blood evacuations, antispasmodics, revulsives and light tonics. We will say a word of each of them: 1¬∞ The baths, at the beginning of the disease, produce an excellent effect. Perhaps they would stop the progression if they were helped by a complete change in the habits of life. 2¬∞ The bleeding or the leeches, as soon as the irritation of the gastric mucosa or of the nervous centers appears, are almost always followed by a slight improvement; but they can only be used with great measure, otherwise they would throw the patient into a fatal weakness. Thus, it is by this way that the distinction of the life's forces into acting forces and radical forces finds its application... It seems that in some cases life is in excess, and yet there is a profound innervation which constitutes the first element of the disease. 3¬∞ The antispasmodics have produced under our eyes no good result. 4¬∞ The revulsives, applied after slight evacuations of blood, have reduced the cerebral accidents. I used moxas without any success in cases of paralysis. 5¬∞ Light astringent tonics served me to moderate the diarrhea when the mucilagineux had failed and when any other treatment was inadmissible. ¬´ Besides, added Mr. Cal√®s, all these resources will be powerless, if they are not employed in the early days; they will be completely useless, if you do not change the conditions in which the patient is placed ... In a word, if you do not run a more generous blood in your veins, you will always turn into a vicious circle and you will not expect anything from your care and your efforts. ¬ª One of the merits of Mr. Cal√®s is, in my eyes, to have understood, one of the first among us, that in the treatment of pellagra, the doctor can not do everything: ¬´ The part of the administration is rather large, he was saying, let's hope it will prove being human and foresighted, as soon as we will clearly point out the disease to it, and that the studies of some men of merit will have enlightened the administration on the means of remedying it. ¬ª in ¬´ Trait√© de la pellagre et des pseudo-pellagres ¬ª (Treatise on pellagra and pseudo-pellagres), p.527, Chapter: Th√©rapeutique, by Th√©ophile Roussel, ed.

He therefore supported the uprising of May and June 1848. Thus, when on 26 August 1848, the Assembly proposed the prosecution of the former member of the Provisional Government Louis Blanc and the former prefect of police Marc Caussidi√®re, who had been accused of having participated to the uprising, Cal√®s strongly opposed the project. Prosecutions will be finally voted by the conservative majority and maintained. Blanc and Caussidi√®re were forced to flee on exile. On 1 September 1848, he also opposed the project of the restoration of the ¬´ contrainte par corps ¬ª (imprisonment for debt, in criminal matters), previously suppressed by the Provisional Government. It will be finally restored by the assembly, even if slightly softened. As humanist, Goderoy Cal√®s was a fervent supporter of a total abolition of the death penalty. Its partial abolition (for political offenses) had been initially decreed by the Provisional Government in February 1848, at the initiative of one of its member, the famous poet Alphonse de Lamartine. A project to extend the partial abolition to a total abolition was then debated at the National Assembly on 16 September 1848. The main abolitionist speaker was the famous writer and poet Victor Hugo. However, Cal√®s and Hugo will finally not succeed in convincing their colleagues: the project will be rejected (and abandoned until 1981). national archives.)

Thus, on 6 October 1848, Godefroy Cal√®s defended the Grevy amendment, which proposed that ¬´ The National Assembly delegates the executive power to a citizen, who takes the title of president of the council of ministers, elected for a limited time, and always revocable ¬ª. Indeed, through this amendment, the young republican Jules Grevy wanted to oppose the project of an election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage, and proposed instead to obtain the election of a president of the executive, who will be always revocable by the National Assembly, thus refusing to legitimize the power to one single person above everything: however, following Lamartine's recommendation, the majority of the deputies rejected the amendment. The date of the presidential election was thus set for 10 December 1848. On 2 November 1848, still supporting social progress in society, Cal√®s voted in favor of the Right to labor, defended at the speaker's tribune by Ledru-Rollin. Nevertheless, the final formula of the compromise, due to Lamartine, obliged the Republic to provide work for the needy ¬´ within the limits of its resources ¬ª. On 25 November 1848, he voted against the parliamentary decree: ¬´ The General Cavaignac has well deserved from the Homeland ¬ª. Being accused of having allowed the June insurrection to flourish, and before violently crushing it, sacrificing thousands of National Guards, General Cavaignac gave explanations at the occasion of a public debate, which took place at the Assembly on 25 November. The debate turned to his advantage, and the Assembly almost unanimously confirmed the previous decree of 28 June 1848. Godefroy Cal√®s, together with Victor Hugo, was one of the only thirty- four representatives who voted against. Among other social measures debated in public at the parliament, Cal√®s voted on 27 December 1848, in favor of the abolition of the tax on salt (against Government's recommendation), which was solicited by representatives of rural regions; on 2 May 1849, for the amnesty of the transported, and on 18 May 1849, for the abolition of the tax on beverages. On 16 April 1849, Cal√®s voted against the credits allocated to the Expedition of Rome and to sending an expeditionary force commanded by General Oudinot. The expedition was nevertheless voted by the National Assembly to initially provide aid to the Roman republicans, insurgent against the pretensions of Pope Pius IX expelled from Rome and against the Austrian domination. It was accompanied by the vote of a 1,200,000 francs loan, for the expenses of the first three months of the operation, to which the Socialists led by Ledru-Rollin opposed.

He thus called for the rapid dissolution of the Constituent National Assembly of 1848 before the term of its legislature, and the election of a new Legislative Assembly. Supported by the government, the ¬´ Rateau proposal ¬ª was opposed by many representatives, from the deputies of the Mountain to some moderate republicans like Alphonse de Lamartine, Adolphe Billault or Jules Gr√©vy, who felt that the task of the Constituent Assembly was not over. Vigorously discussed on 12 January 1849, Godefroy Cal√®s and the Left couldn't prevent its adoption on 29 January. Thus, on 26 May 1849, the Constituent National Assembly held its final seance. Godefroy Cal√®s did not belong to the newly elected Legislative National Assembly of 1849, nor to other Assemblies. He came back to his region of Villefranche-de-Lauragais to resume his activity of physician, until his death on 25 July 1868, at the age of 69. He was married to madame Zulm√©e Cal√®s (born L√©onie Alphonsine Zulm√©e Metg√©), with whom he got a son on 24 July 1828, Jean Jules Godefroy, who will also become a physician, and will be elected Mayor of Villefranche-de-Lauragais in 1875, and Deputy of Haute-Garonne in 1885, under the Third Republic.  Genealogy  Godefroy Cal√®s is: * the nephew of Jean-Marie Cal√®s (1757-1834), regicide and deputy at the National Convention (1792-1795) and at the Council of Five Hundred (1795-1798). * the nephew of Jean-Chrysost√¥me Cal√®s (1769-1853), colonel of the Great Army and baron of the Empire. He has also been elected representative of the ephemeral Chamber of Representatives created by Napoleon during the period of the Hundred Days in 1815. * the father of Jean Jules Godefroy Cal√®s (1828-1889), deputy at the Chamber of Deputies (Third Republic) (1885-1889).  Hommage  * The name of Godefroy Cal√®s resurfaced in the 1930s during the apogee of the Radical Party in France. In search of an affirmation of his identity on the Left, the figure of Cal√®s will be singularly commemorated in an article of the ¬´ Le Radical ¬ª, the press organ of the party, on 11 May 1930.¬´ [...] Has the city of Villefranche, in Haute- Garonne, retained the memory of Godefroy Cal√©s who, born in Saint-Denis on 21 March 1799, played such an important role in the municipal destinies and carried out such a beautiful radical propaganda in the region. He was the nephew of a conventional dead man in exile, the son of a republican sub- prefect. An outstanding doctor who had published a still famous treatise on pellagra, he had studied at Montpellier and had settled at Villefranche. His fellow citizens, in saluting the victory of the Three Glorious, had appointed him in 1830 commander of the National Guard. In 1848, a municipal councilor, he proclaimed the Republic at the Town Hall and became mayor, then deputy to the Constituent Assembly. Ledru-Rollin had enlisted him in the ranks of the Mountain, and after having fought against the Empire, he had formed at Villefranche the secular and democratic propaganda to which so many good doctors of the last century associated themselves.

It is named after one of the classical albedo features on Mars, Ogygis Regio. Its name, which refers to Ogyges, a primeval mythological ruler in ancient Greece, was officially approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on September 17, 2015. It is situated just outside Argyre Planitia, a plain located in the southern highlands of Mars. The dunes of Ogygis Undae extend from latitude ‚àí49.94¬∞N to ‚àí49.37¬∞N and from longitude 292.64¬∞E to 294.93¬∞E (65.07¬∞W ‚Äì 67.36¬∞W). They are centered at latitude ‚àí49.66¬∞N, longitude 293.79¬∞E (66.21¬∞W), and extend approximately 87 km to the east and west from there. Ogygis Undae has an area of 1904 km2, and due to its large size is a primary subject for research on Martian dune morphology and sand composition.  Morphology  Ogygis Undae is the final sink of an extended sand transport system that was imaged with the HRSC camera onboard ESA Mars Express. The complexity of this transport system is as extensive as some terrestrial examples. Dunes in Ogygis Undae have several morphologies including: barhcan, barchanoid, dome and star dunes. The variety of dune types indicates that they were deposited in a multimodal wind regime with different winds converging into the basin where the dunes are located, carrying sand from multiple source areas. The morphological complexity is mirrored by the diverse mineral composition of the dune-forming sediment.  Composition  Mineral distribution across the dune fields of Ogygis Undae is non-uniform and bimodal. The relative juxtaposition of the two primary grain types reveals how Aeolian processes affect the transport of sand on the surface of Mars. Compositional spectra were acquired and analyzed in 2016 by USGS scientists using both the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument on board Mars Global Surveyor and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on board the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft. Other characteristics of Ogygis Undae, such as its nocturnal thermal inertia values, corroborate the finding that there is a bimodal sand-type distribution across the field. Thermal emission spectroscopy results from the large dune field located inside Gale Crater were used as a reference for data obtained from Ogygis Undae because the features of Gale Crater were investigated extensively both by orbiting spacecraft and on site by the NASA Mars rover, Curiosity, a part of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. Ogygis Undae differs from the Gale dune field in both sand-type composition and homogeneity, indicating differences in both the types of sources for these dune fields as well as the distance from their respective sand-sources. The USGS investigators also noted that the dunes of Ogygis Undae look similar to the dunes in Grand Falls, Arizona.

Founded as a freight-only railroad in 2004, it leases and has trackage rights on lines owned by the Norfolk Southern and the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. It also operates an industrial switching railroad at the Port of Cleveland. Construction of the track Former Cleveland and Mahoning Valley tracks, now leased by the CCR, at Harvard Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio Former Connotton Valley tracks, now leased by the CCR, at Miles Avenue and E. 104th Street in Cleveland, Ohio In 1853, the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad (C&MV;) finished laying its tracks through what was then Newburgh Township (south of Cleveland). After a series of owners, it ended up in the hands of the Norfolk Southern in 1999. From 1881 to 1882, the Connotton Valley Railway built its line through Newburgh (now largely annexed by the city of Cleveland). After a series of bankruptcies, the line ended up in the hands of the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. A series of consolidations and mergers left the road in the hands of the Norfolk Southern. In 1990, the Norfolk Southern sold the road to a new corporation, also named the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. Founding the CCR In 2002, the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway entered into a lease with a start-up railroad, the Connotton Valley Railway, Inc. The lease covered of track from the Wheeling's terminus in downtown Cleveland to Glenwillow, Ohio. The agreement also gave the lessee access to the Wheeling's train yard at Falls Junction (near Glenwillow) and to several sidings. The Connotton's lease ended in 2004, and the Wheeling was looking for a new operator for the shortline. The Wheeling approached Michael Kole, a trustee of the Midwest Railway Preservation Society who had experience operating freight trains. Kole contacted the society's president, Bill Brown, a former insurance executive, who agreed to join the venture and provide administrative expertise. With co-investor Douglas Fink, the Cleveland Commercial Railroad Co. LLC was founded and became the new lessee. A month later, the United States Department of Transportation awarded a $25 million ($ in dollars) low-interest loan to allow the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway to modernize, repair, and replace of track. The work included the CCR's shortline. Expansion In June 2009, CCR signed a second lease agreement, expanding its system. The lease covered of Norfolk Southern track between the Von Willer yard (near E. 93rd Street and Harvard Avenue) in Cleveland and Aurora, Ohio. In January 2011, the CCR signed an agreement with the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority, which operates the Port of Cleveland, to run the port's new switching service. Although only a few thousand feet of track were built, the service made it much easier for Great Lakes freighters to move cargo directly onto rail cars, which would be pushed by a CCR locomotive onto the tracks or connect to a train of a nearby Class I railroad. That same month, the CCR won a $170,000 ($ in dollars) loan from the Ohio Rail Development Commission to build a spur in Bedford Heights, Ohio, which would allow the CCR to serve four steel companies. Brown discovered the spur, which had gone unmarked on railroad maps, in late 2010. The state loan allowed CCR to replace about of missing track, cut back vegetation, repair and rehabilitate the existing rails and track bed to make the spur usable, and a loading/unloading area.

The fire, which was started by a lightning strike on July 24, 2017, became a megafire on September 3, growing from to over , at which time it became the nation‚Äôs top wildfire priority as of early September 2017. Located north and east of Seeley Lake, Montana, over 700 firefighting personnel were assigned to the blaze, primarily active in a mountainous lodgepole and mixed conifer forest. The fire had burned and at one point threatened over 1,000 homes in Powell County and Missoula County including the town of Seeley Lake, Montana and areas north of Highway 200, east of Highway 83. Evacuation orders included parts of Powell County north of Montana Highway 200, areas east of Montana Highway 83, and evacuation warnings for other sections of the forest within Missoula County. Fire as seen from Seeley Lake, Montana August The Rice Ridge Fire was started by a lightning strike on July 24, 2017. By August 5, the fire had spread near Morrell Falls and made runs towards the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Aircraft focused on making water drops while crews worked on protective activities along Highway 83 and on the northside of Seeley Lake and Double Arrow Lodge. Evacuation warnings were put in place for residents of on both side of Highway 83 south of Rice Ridge Road to Morrell Creek and south of Cottonwood Lakes Road, east of Highway 83, including Seeley Lake and Double Arrow Lodge. The American Red Cross opened a shelter at the Potomac Community Center. On September 6, a drone flew into the restricted fire area, causing fire protection work to stop temporarily. As of August 7, Seeley Lake itself was closed so that aerial crews could draw water from the lake, but the homes and businesses around the lake were open. The fire burned on the east side of Rice Ridge and in Swamp Creek. Crews shifted to focus on containing the fire on Morrell Mountain, also protecting the Morrell Mountain Lookout. Seeley Lake re-opened for recreational use on August 18. The next day, one campground remained closed and the fire had grown in Cottonwood Creek, causing Lolo National Forest to expand closures. On August 24, a forest service road, running north along Cottonwood Canyon, was evacuated due to threats to two cabins. Two trails were also closed. By the 27th, the fire had expanded to and threatened 1,060 homes. The next day, Seeley Lake was once more closed for recreational use. A third drone flight through the fire zone caused the crew activities to stop that evening. Mandatory evacuations were put in place due to the fire threatening 580 homes in the Seeley Lake area and schools were closed. September As of September 1, the fire had burned and was 18% contained. The fire continued to burn on Morrell Mountain and towards Cottonwood Lakes Road. Seeley Swan High School classes moved to a local resort due to fire threats. The Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area was closed, too. By Sunday night, September 3, the fire grew into a megafire after mapping flights reported it had burned , nearly doubling in size within 24 hours. Additional evacuations were put in place over the next two days. By the morning of September 5, the Reef Fire merged into the Rice Ridge Fire. That evening, mandatory evacuation orders were lifted for Seeley Lake. On September 7, Seeley Lake reopened for recreational use. By the end of the next day, structure protections were completed for 25 homes on the north side of Placid Lake and on cabins around Coopers Lake. A strategic, aerial burnout took place over three days to help secure the fire line. Evacuation orders were revoked on September 15 and the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area and lands owned by The Nature Conservancy were re-opened.

It was built to a design by John Welch at a cost of ¬£180. It is a column of the Grecian Doric Order built from locally sourced stone, the work being undertaken by John Thomas. It was listed as a Registered Building of the Isle of Man in 1984. History Site of ancient market cross Castletown, the scene of the death of Margaret Inequane and her son, who were burned at the stake having been found guilty of witchcraft. The Smelt Monument was erected on a site which was formerly occupied by an ancient market cross. It was on this site in 1617 that Margaret Inequane and her son were burned at the stake having been found guilty of witchcraft.http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/towns/castltwn/witch.htm After the death of Cornelius Smelt in 1832, Sir William Hillary, a friend of Smelt's, proposed that a memorial be built in his honour. A meeting was called at the Seneschal's Office, Seneschal Lane, Douglas, on 18 August 1835, where it was decided that a column should be erected, financed partly from funds then being held in Holmes' Bank and intended for a portrait of Smelt. A further ¬£200 was raised, and John Welch, an architect, drew up two designs, one for an obelisk, and the other a Grecian Doric. Following deliberation the Grecian Doric design was decided upon, and the contract was awarded to John Thomas, the consideration being ¬£180. At a further meeting at the George Inn in Castletown it was resolved to site the monument at the intersection of the College and Castletown Roads, near Hango Hill, and space was set aside for the construction. However this met with a strong objection from Deemster John Christian. Deemster Christian suggested the monument be sited either in front of King William's College or on The Parade. It was subsequently decided to site the monument on The Parade, Castletown, facing Castle Rushen. Welch was well known to Sir William Hillary being responsible for the design of the Tower of Refuge, and the architect's services were requisitioned for the Smelt Memorial Scheme. A request was made to Welch by the committee to: It was fully intended that there was to be an official first stone laying, to be undertaken by Sir William. But there was such a delay in arranging this that the contractor had to start work, and by the end of October 1836, the masons had a portion of the column built. No formal stone laying ceremony was carried out. The work was completed in early January 1837. Statue Various rumours persist regarding the placing of a statue of Cornelius Smelt on top of the monument; a particular one suggests that funds had been exhausted and there was no money available for a statue. Therefore the following letter from Sir William Hillary to John McHutchin, the Clerk of the Rolls on the subject of a surmounting statue is of particular interest. Sir William Hillary did not receive sufficient support for his scheme to erect a statue. The reference in his letter to a \\"portrait in the possession of Capt. Bacon;\\" concerns the Smelt Portrait, a painting of Cornelius Smelt by Thomas Barber. In addition to the Smelt Monument, John Welch designed numerous buildings on the Isle of Man; two of the most prominent being the Tower of Refuge and King William's College.Mona's Herald, Tuesday, March 10, 1931; Page: 7 See also *Cornelius Smelt *Smelt portrait References External links Buildings and structures in the Isle of Man Monumental columns in the United Kingdom Cultural infrastructure completed in 1837 1836 establishments in England Registered Buildings of the Isle of Man Monuments and memorials in the Isle of Man ","title":"Smelt Monument"},{"id":"55149750","text":"Hitier is a French surname.

They had a very uniform and distinct appearance; specifically they were armed with a spear (dory) in their right hand and a heavy round shield in their left. Hoplite soldiers were organized in battle into the \\"Phalanx formation\\". The goal of this formation was to create uniformity and a powerful military force in order to maximize the effectiveness as the army as a whole, rather than use people as individual fighters. With the hoplite formation everyone was the same in battle. The Phalanx formation appeared during the 7th and 8th centuries BC. The representation of hoplites in art show historians how the Greeks used this formation in battle as well as how the soldiers were dressed and what their armor looked like. The hoplite formation is shown in different styles of pottery such as white ground and black figure and also on many different types of pottery such an olpe, krater, alabastron, and dinos. Across all depictions, hoplite soldiers wear the same armor and carry the same weapons in the same position. In addition, the aspect of uniformity is emphasized in these representations.  Representations in art   Chigi Vase  thumb Chigi Vase 650-640 BC The Chigi Vase is a Protocorinthian olpe and was made by the Chigi Painter from 650-640 BC. The Chigi Vase was discovered in an Etruscan tomb at Monte Aguzzo. It is black-figure style with an unusual use of polychromy. It contains the earliest known representation of the hoplite phalanx formation. The vase shows the moment that the two hoplite formations come in contact in battle. Each soldier is armed with a decorative round shield in their left hand and a long spear in their right as well as a helmet. Behind the soldiers is a flute player that may have been used to keep the hoplites marching correctly. The Chigi vase is arguably one of the most important representations of the Hoplite Soldier in Greek Art. The Chigi Vase gives historians as insight to how the phalanx formation was used in battle.  Terracotta Alabastron  Terracotta alabastron 590‚Äì570 BC This Middle Corinthian perfume vase from 590‚Äì570 BC contains two friezes of the hoplite phalanx. The terracotta vase uses a form of black figure and is only 21.3 cm in height. Both friezes show hoplites with a circular shield in their left hand, spear in their right, as well as a typical hoplite helmet. All of the hoplites are faced in the same way and have about the same distance in between their feet. This could reflect the state of uniformity and the lack of individualism within hoplite warfare. The top frieze is interrupted by another figure who does not resemble a hoplite soldier. The rest of the vase is decorated with lines and dots, creating zones on the vase.  Hoplite black figure Dinos  This Attic black figure Dinos now located in Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris was made by \\"The Louvre Painter\\" in 560 BC. It contains three friezes. The first depicts Troilos and Polyxena at the fountain, a Centauromachy, the return of Hephaistos, and a symposium. The middle frieze shows a hoplite phalanx, and the bottom frieze shows a horse race. The frieze with the hoplites shows two hoplite formations engaging in battle. The hoplite in front of the first phalanx advances to the left over a body. Another hoplite extends his arm as he leans to throw he spear to the warrior in front of him. The warriors on foot all possess typical characteristics of hoplites with their spear and round shield as well as their helmet. In addition the hoplites are close to each other in proximity which is a feature of the phalanx formation.  Attic Black-Figure Calyx Krater  thumb Attic Black- Figure Calyx Krater This Calyx Krater was made in 530 BCE from Pharsala and uses the black figure stye. It is also painted in the manner of Exekias. The Calyx Krater depicts the scene a Four-horse chariot and a Homeric battle around the body of a dead warrior, that might be Patroklos. The main focus of the scene is on the two hoplites clashing in battle, behind each of them is a hoplite phalanx. This image gives insight into how two hoplite formations engaged in battle. The figures can be identified as hoplites because of their round shield in their left hand as well as their spear in the right hand.  Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Alabastron  The \\"Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Ababastron\\" was made by the Haimon painter in 480 BC and it from the late Archaic period. It is attic black figure and white ground. The lower frieze represents a Gigantomachy. Herakles and Athena fight five giants, four of whom are represented as hoplites. The viewer can tell that the giants are hoplites because of the typical helmets, the round shield held in the left hand, and the spear in the right hand. One of the hoplite giants is on the ground to due to his fight with Athena. the others are attacking Herakles from behind. This work of art is an interesting take on the typical Gigantomachy. The representation of the hoplite formation in this period hints that the Greeks were still using this formation in warfare. In addition, this alabastron is an example of the combination of a mythological battle (the Gigantomachy) and aspects of real battles (the hoplite formation) that we see in other examples of Greek Art, specifically the Temple of Athena Nike on the Akropolis and the Stoa Poikile on the Classical Agora.

On the east bank of the river, a beautification started in 2011, of which the first phase ended in 2012. History The banks of the Hooghly River (West Bengal, India) housed the trading posts of the British, French, Portuguese, Dutch and Danish in the 17th to 19th centuries. Later, large jute mills were built, and industrialisation started. With the reduction in the port activity, a decline in the jute industry and a change in political dynamics, the riverfront was further neglected. The once-grand warehouses, temples, ghats, and river-facing houses are in need of restoration. People visit it in the evenings on weekends to go boating on the river, stroll along the bank and purchase food from stalls there. One stall selling ice-cream and fast food has been there for more than 40 years. A 2-kilometre (1.2 mi) stretch of the beautified riverfront from Prinsep Ghat to Babughat (Baje Kadamtala Ghat) was inaugurated on 24 May 2012. It has illuminated and landscaped gardens and pathways, fountains and renovated ghats. One of the songs in the Bollywood film Parineeta was shot here on the ghats. The riverfront includes Millennium Park, a millennium gift from the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA/CMDA) that was inaugurated on 26 December 1999. The park was part of the first phase of the Kolkata Riverside Beautification Project.

Career He received his BA from Amherst College in 1887 and his Ph.D. at the Konigliche-Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Berlin in 1892. His thesis, The Aesthetic Element in Morality and Its Place in a Utilitararian Theory of Morals, was published in book form in both English and German in 1893. His entire teaching career was spent on the philosophy faculty at the University of Wisconsin, where he was made a full professor in 1905. He served as President of the Western Division of the American Philosophical Society during the 1907-1908 term. Among Sharp's other publications are Shakespeare's Portrayal of the Moral Life (1902); A Study of the Influence of Custom on Moral Judgment (1908); A Course in Moral Instruction for the High School (1909); Syllabus on Moral Instruction (with Frederic James Gould, 1911); Ethics (1928); Business Ethics: Studies in Fair Competition (1937); Problems in Business Ethics (1937); and Good Will and Ill Will: A Study in Moral Judgments (1950), the last of which was published posthumously. Philosophy Sharp was among the first philosophers to focus on business ethics, in which he discussed the fair treatment of employees, consumers, and competitors. His Syllabus on Moral Instruction was, for a time, used by the United States military for troop instruction. Sharp was also among the first philosophers to perform empirical studies of moral intuitions, conducting surveys at the University of Wisconsin, both of highly educated liberal arts students and of agricultural students who had had limited formal education. Sharp believed that these studies confirmed his utilitarian ethical positions. He is credited with being the first moral philosopher to use a variant of the now famous trolley problem in which a switchman must choose between saving many strangers or his own daughter from a runaway train. A brief summary of Sharp's philosophy may be found in Richard Brandt's review of Sharp's Good Will and Ill Will.The Philosophical Review, Vol. 60, No. 3 (Jul., 1951), pp. 400-402 Frank Chapman Sharp Memorial Prize The Frank Chapman Sharp Memorial Prize was established by the American Philosophical Society in 1990 to honor Sharp's memory.

Plumer was the son of William Plumer and his wife Elizabeth Byde, daughter of Thomas Byde of Ware Park, and was born on 24 May 1736. He was admitted at Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1752. He married as his first wife Frances Dorothy Carey daughter of Lucius Charles Carey, 7th Viscount Falkland on 12 July 1760. She died in December 1761. Plumer was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Lewes at a by- election in February 1763. The Duke of Newcastle had supported his stand at Lewes because he was considered a strong candidate, and wished him to stand there at the following election. However Plumer wanted to stand at his home seat at Hertfordshire. He succeeded his father to Blakesware and Gilston Park, Hertfordshire on 12 December 1767 and the Duke eventually agreed to release him from a commitment to stand at Lewes. Plumer was popular in Hertfordshire; his position there was strong and he was returned for Hertfordshire without opposition at the 1768 general election. There were contested elections in 1774 and 1784, and each time he headed the poll by a large majority. In 1780 he was again returned unopposed. The English Chronicle wrote in 1781 as follows: ‚ÄúWilliam Plumer is one of the most opulent country gentlemen in the kingdom. Beside possessing the most extensive property of any gentleman in this county, his additional estates in Essex, Middlesex, and Suffolk, make up a clear income of fifteen thousand pounds per annum ... In his parliamentary character he has been uniform in his opposition to all the measures of the present Administration; and though no speaker, is one of the most constant attendants upon his legislative duty, and suffers no question to pass without that substantial indication of his political talents, a direct negative to the minister. His activity out of the House is not less conspicuous than his honest zeal within it ... His character, as a private individual, is of that kind that totally exempts him from the smallest imputation of being under the direction of any improper motive in the enthusiasm of his public exertions. His fortune raises him above the influence of pecuniary temptation, and the pitiful ambition of titular importance constitutes no part of his foibles. Having little to wish, therefore, and nothing to fear, he is governed by no consideration but his own conviction, and without any pretensions to the estimation of one of the first politicians in the kingdom is, beyond, all doubt, one of the sincerest. Plumer headed the poll again in the 1790 general election. He remarried to Jane Hamilton daughter of Hon. and Rev. George Hamilton on 9 August 1791. He topped the poll again in the 1796 and 1802 general elections and was returned unopposed in 1806. However he was in poor health and retired at the 1807 general election on a plea of ‚Äòadvancing age‚Äô. Then he missed his participation in Parliament and at the age of 76, he accepted the seat of Higham Ferrers from his friend Earl Fitzwilliam and was returned in the 1812 general election. By 1815 he was deaf and suffering from rheumatism and gout, and it was said he never stayed in the House after six o'clock. He was too ill to attend early in 1816 and considered retiring but went to Higham Ferrers for his re-election in the 1818 general election. Plumer died on 15 January 1822 without issue. His widow and heiress from his second marriage married, as her third husband, Robert Ward, MP, who adopted the name Plumer and moved into Gilston Park.

She worked as an editor in Lankesh Patrike, a Kannada weekly started by her father P. Lankesh, and ran her own weekly called Gauri Lankesh Patrike. She was shot to death by assailants outside her home in Rajarajeshwari Nagar on 5 September 2017. At the time of her death, Gauri was known for being a critic of right-wing Hindu extremism. She was honoured with Anna Politkovskaya Award for speaking against right-wing Hindu extremism, campaigning for women's rights and opposing caste based discrimination.  Early life and career  Gauri Lankesh was born in a Kannada Lingayat family on 29 January 1962. Her father is the poet-journalist P. Lankesh, who established the Kannada-language weekly tabloid Lankesh Patrike. She had two siblings, Kavitha and Indrajit. Gauri started her career as a journalist with The Times of India in Bangalore. Later, she moved to Delhi with her husband, Chidanand Rajghatta. Shortly after, she returned to Bangalore, where she worked as a correspondent for the Sunday magazine for nine years. At the time of her father's death in 2000, she was working for the Eenadu's Telugu television channel in Delhi. By this time, she had spent 16 years of her life as a journalist.  Lankesh Patrike  When their father P. Lankesh died, Gauri and her brother Indrajit visited Mani, the publisher of Lankesh Patrike, and told him that they wanted to cease the publication. Mani convinced them against the idea. Gauri then became the editor of Lankesh Patrike, while her brother Indrajit handled the publication's business affairs. Beginning in 2001, differences developed between Gauri and Indrajit over the paper's ideology. These differences became public in February 2005, when a report about a Naxalite attack on policemen, approved by Gauri, was published in the magazine. On 13 February, Indrajit (who was the paper's proprietor and publisher) withdrew the report, alleging that it favored the Naxals. On 14 February, Indrajit filed a police complaint against Gauri, accusing her of stealing a computer, printer, and scanner from the publication's office. Gauri filed a counter-complaint, accusing Indrajit of threatening her with a revolver. On 15 February, Indrajit held a press conference, where he accused Gauri of promoting Naxalism through the paper. Gauri held a separate press conference where she denied the accusation and stated that her brother was opposed to her social activism. Gauri subsequently started her own Kannada weekly called Gauri Lankesh Patrike.  Political views and ideology  Gauri was a staunch critic of right-wing Hindutva politics.Rollo Romig, \\"Railing against right-wing Nationalism was a calling, it was also a death sentence. How the journalist Gauri Lankesh became a casualty of India's increasingly intolerant politics\\", in The New York Times, 14 March 2019. Retrieved 15 March 2019. In 2003, she opposed the Sangh Parivar's alleged attempts to Hinduise the Sufi shrine Guru Dattatreya Baba Budan Dargah located at Baba Budan giri. In 2012, while participating in a protest demanding a ban on communal groups in Mangalore, she stated that Hinduism was not a religion but a \\"system of hierarchy in society\\" in which \\"women are treated as second-class creatures\\". She endorsed a minority religion tag for the Lingayat community and headed the Komu Souharda Vedike, a communal harmony platform for the oppressed communities. She was also of the view that the followers of philosopher Basavanna were not Hindus. Gauri was known for advocating freedom of the press. She had written about the wrongdoings of the Indian National Congress leader, D. K. Shivakumar, a close associate of the former Chief Minister of Karnataka, S. M. Krishna. She was opposed to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and ended her 35-year-old friendship with Prakash Belawadi when the latter became a media advisor to the BJP during the 2014 Indian general election. In November 2014, the Congress- led Karnataka government appointed Gauri as a member of a committee aimed at convincing the Naxalites to give up violence and surrender. However, a delegation of BJP leaders accused her of being a Naxalite sympathiser and demanded her removal from the committee. The chief minister Siddaramaiah rejected the demand. Gauri was openly critical of the caste system. In 2015, some Brahmins accused her of criticising the novelist S. L. Bhyrappa and Brahminism during the 81st Kannada Sahitya Sammelana (Kannada literary conference) held at Shravanabelagola. At the conference, Gauri remarked that the low-caste author Perumal Murugan was criticised by right-wing Hindu groups for depicting a childless Hindu couple who indulged in consensual sex rituals outside of marriage to have children in his book One Part Woman. She then pointed out that the Brahmin novelist S. L. Bhyrappa had also depicted the similar Niyoga practice in his novel Parva, a retelling of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. She clarified that she was supportive of both these writers, and asked why the Hindu groups who were offended by Perumal Murugan were not offended by Bhyrappa. On 19 February 2015, protesters from the Hassan Zilla Brahmin Sabha (\\"Hassan district Brahmin Association\\") organised a rally against her, urging the police to register a First Information Report against her.  Defamation conviction in 2016  On 23 January 2008, Gauri published an article titled \\"Darodegilada BJP galu\\" in her newspaper. The article criticised the BJP leaders Pralhad Joshi, Umesh Dushi, Shivanand Bhat, and Venkatesh Mestry. The article stated that the three BJP workers had cheated a jeweller of . It also stated that the jeweller sought justice from Member of Parliament Joshi and threatened to approach the police should Joshi refuse to help him. Gauri later said that the article was based on \\"sources within the BJP\\". Joshi and Dushi filed separate defamation suits against Gauri. In Dushi's case, she was a co-accused with Devanand Jagapur, the writer of the article. Gauri stated that she was being targeted for her left-leaning political views, as the BJP leaders did not sue other local dailies who had published the same allegations. Gauri moved the case to the High Court, seeking dismissal of the case against her. However, in 2016, the High Court refused to dismiss the case and gave instructions for the hearing to be continued in the lower court. The High Court granted a four-week stay on the case, however, and directed the lower court to complete the trial within six months. In October 2016, the second Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Court at Hubli issued an arrest warrant for Gauri after she failed to appear before the court and did not respond to earlier warrants. The police detained her and produced her before the court on 1 October 2016. She was released on bail after furnishing a personal bond of . On 27 November 2016, the second JMFC court concluded that Gauri had failed to provide any substantial evidence for her criticism of the BJP leaders and found her guilty of defamation. The court imposed a fine of on her in each case. Besides the total fine of , the court also sentenced her to six months imprisonment. Her co-accused, Devanand Jagapur, was acquitted by the same court. The same court granted her anticipatory bail, however, which made her avoid prison time. Gauri stated that the BJP leaders had managed to cover their tracks by reaching a compromise with the jeweler; she refused to disclose her source for the corruption allegations against them. She also described the court verdict as a temporary setback and declared that she would challenge it in the higher court.  Personal life  Gauri and Chidanand Rajghatta divorced after five years of marriage; she remained single after the separation. Although she lived alone and did not have any children, she considered the activists Jignesh Mevani, Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid Shora as her \\"adopted children\\" metaphorically.  Death  On 5 September 2017, three unidentified men shot Gauri to death at her house in Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Bangalore. The men fired at least seven bullets at her at around 8 p.m. while she was unlocking the main door of her house after returning from her office. One of the killers, who was waiting for her near her house, fired the first shots at her, while the two others, who are suspected to have followed her from her office, joined the initial shooter thereafter. The killers were wearing helmets and escaped on a two-wheeler Honda Dio after the murder. Three of the bullets pierced Gauri's head, neck, and chest, resulting in her death at the scene.  Reactions  The murder was condemned by several people and organisations, including the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Indian National Congress and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The Congress leader and Karnataka Home Minister Ramalinga Reddy compared the murder to that of Narendra Dabholkar and M. M. Kalburgi. The state police chief, R. K. Dutta, refused to suggest any possible suspects without investigation. The BJP leader K. S. Eshwarappa criticised the Congress-led state government for allegedly failing to protect the lives of Gauri and other writers like Kalburgi. Protests over her death took place all across India, including a rally in Bangalore a week after the funeral attended by more than 25,000 people. Gauri was given a state funeral with a gun salute on 6 September, after her body was kept for a few hours at Ravindra Kalakshetra for the public to pay tribute. She was buried in accordance with Lingayat customs. Her family did not follow any religious customs for her as she identified as a rationalist. The BBC described it as the most high-profile journalist murdered in recent years. The New York Times reported that several accounts followed by Narendra Modi had posted \\"hateful\\" tweets in response to Lankesh's assassination, prompting a debate in India.  Investigation  During their investigation, the police accessed CCTV footage from her residence and the route leading from Basavanagudi to her house. The city was kept on high alert the day after her death, with police being deployed at toll gates in Nelamangala, Hosur Road and NICE Road in search of the killers. Vehicles entering or exiting the city underwent stringent checks, while police in the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were also alerted. On 8 September, the Karnataka government announced a reward of for providing information about the killers. In 2018, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the murder case detained two suspects, whom they also suspected of being involved in the murders of Dabholkar and Kalburgi. In June 2018, the SIT stated that Parashuram Waghmore had confessed to the murder: he claimed that he was told to kill someone to save his religion, and that he did not know who the victim was. In September 2018, Maharashtra ATS detained 2 suspects related to her murder and also recovered cache of arms from them. A March 2019 New York Times article on Gauri Lankesh includes a discussion of the police investigation and murder charges. In popular culture The assassination is featured along with assassinations of other rationalists such as Narendra Dabholkar, M. M. Kalburgi and Govind Pansare in the documentary mini-series Vivek-Reason by Anand Patwardhan. Legacy Gauri Lankesh is seen as an important figure for people who are protesting against rightward shift in the governance, for instance on her third birth anniversary several journalists and activists participated in #IfWeDoNotRise campaign in her memory and in wake of arrests of dissidents across the nation.

He was the first director of the Lincoln Park Zoo, holding this position from 1888 to 1919.  Career  DeVry was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He came to Chicago in part to succeed his uncle, Herman DeVry, who had overseen Lincoln Park until his death in 1888. When Cy DeVry took over the zoo in the park, it was a haphazard array of animal cages. Over the course of the 1890s he arranged for the construction of purpose-built structures such as an aviary, a monkey house, and a visitor's center including a gift shop. DeVry was a colorful personality, known for his ever-present cigar and tiger-tooth watch fob. Though popular with the public, his political independence and drinking habit made him enemies in Chicago politics. He was dismissed from his position in 1900, but was rehired in 1901 after a political shakeup at the parks commission. Animal-handling methods of the time were crude and unsafe, and DeVry, who had been handling large animals from boyhood, was known as a hands- on zookeeper. He was seriously wounded on multiple occasions, most seriously in 1901 when Leo the lion bit off the end of his index finger. The wound healed poorly and DeVry was told that the hand might have to be amputated. Devastated, he attempted suicide by gunshot, but survived. In two respects DeVry was an innovative zookeeper. In the first place, he believed that captive animals required stimulation and enrichment, although his methods were peculiar by today's standards. For instance, he kept his monkeys entertained by placing a pig in their enclosure. Although the pig provided plenty of diversion to the monkeys, the arrangement drew the ire of the Illinois Humane Society. DeVry was also an early example of a zoological ambassador. He gave frequent interviews, conducted animal publicity stunts, and innovated public relations techniques that would later be used by the likes of Jim Fowler and Joan Embery. For instance, he presented a bear cub during the pre-game at what became Wrigley Field, at the first home game of the Chicago Cubs. In 1919 DeVry was fired after engaging in an altercation with a zoo visitor who had been pestering some young women. A petition protesting his dismissal attracted 50,000 signatures, but park commissioners determined that DeVry's presence was inimical to discipline. After leaving the Lincoln Park Zoo, DeVry accepted a position at the East Los Angeles menagerie of William Selig.

(formerly known as Shandong Qixing Iron Tower Co., Ltd.) is a Chinese company with two main lines of business in the manufacturing towers for power transmission and communications and other industrial products and the provision of wireless broadband services. History The company was founded in 2002 as a part of the Qixing Group, a private industrial group based in Shandong with diversified holdings. In February 2010, the company became listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Financial troubles and sale to Longyue The parent company, Qixing Group, experienced financial difficulties due to overborrowing and rapid expansion in the 2010s. At the peak of its expansion in 2012, the parent company had added capacity to its core business of aluminum production and entered into new lines of business. Years later the president of the China Aluminum Association would say \\"Qixing expanded blindly\\". Throughout 2014, the parent company and its subsidiary Qixing Iron Tower engaged in intracompany lending transactions that were not adequately disclosed according to the listing rules of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The Shandong provincial bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission launched an investigation into Qixing Iron Tower into the intragroup lending activity. The securities regulator found the company had violated its disclosure obligations and imposed penalties. Amid the financial troubles, the Qixing Group would sell almost its entire stake in Qixing Iron Tower to Longyue Investment in December 2014. After the sale, Longyue Investment became the controlling shareholder of Qixing Iron Tower was a 31.87% share and Qixing Group only retained a 3.07% share. Stonewall takeover bid The company attempted to move into mining in a takeover bid extending from 2013-14. Qixing Iron Tower made a preliminary offer in May 2013 for Australian-based Stonewall Resources, an Australian Securities Exchange listed miner with assets in Australia and South Africa. After due diligence was completed, the sale of Stonewall Resources was announced in November 2013. The proposed transaction required necessary approvals in China, South Africa, and Australia, prolonging the duration of the deal process. The parties worked throughout 2014 to obtain the approvals to close the deal. However, the deal was terminated by Qixing Iron Tower in November 2014, 10 days before the deadline for completion. Diversification into wireless broadband After the purchase by Longyue Investment, the company was the vehicle for the 3.55 billion RMB acquisition in 2015 of Beixun Telecom, provider of wireless broadband services. The company raised funds for the acquisition via a private placement worth 6.3 billion RMB with the amount raised going towards the purchase consideration and an expansion of Beixun's wireless broadband data network in nines cities. After the acquisition the company changed its name to Northcom. Products and market The company is involved in providing wireless broadband services and manufactures a range of steel products including communications and power transmission towers. Its primary clients in the manufacturing segment are utilities and telecom companies including the two major Chinese utilities China State Grid and China Southern Power Grid, Reliance Group of India and ZTE.

Seveso III is implemented in national legislation and is enforced by national chemical safety authorities. Seveso-III Directive aims at preventing such incidents and minimising their risks. All EU countries are obliged to adopt measures at national and company level to prevent major accidents and to ensure appropriate preparedness and response should such accidents nevertheless happen. Industrial plants in the European Union are covered by the provisions of the Directive if dangerous substances are or could be present in the ‚Äòestablishment‚Äô in quantities exceeding the relevant thresholds mentioned in the Directive.

Seveso III replaces the previous Seveso I (Directive 82/501/EC) and Seveso II (Directive 96/82/EC) directives, updating the laws due to for example changes in chemical classification regulations. Seveso III gets its name from the Seveso disaster, which occurred in 1976 in Italy. Seveso III establishes minimum quantity thresholds for reporting and safety permits.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 60 resources, which included 46 contributing buildings, one contributing structure, 12 non-contributing buildings, and one non-contributing structure.. With 31 photos from 2013-2014. Cedar Rapids was platted on the east bank of the Cedar River as Rapids City in 1841, and it was incorporated under the same name in 1849. Kingston was established on the west bank of the river in 1852. The two smaller communities consolidated in 1870 as Cedar Rapids. The streets were laid out parallel and perpendicular to the river, which flowed from the northwest to the southeast. The Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad was the first to arrive in the community in 1859 and the tracks were laid on Fourth Street on the eastern edge of the central business district. The first bridge across the river was built at Third Avenue in 1871. The first commercial buildings in this area were log and wood frame construction. After the American Civil War they began to be replaced by more substantial masonry structures. The buildings that make up the historic district date from 1880 to 1965, and are representative of the various architectural styles and vernacular building forms that were popular during this time period. While they differ in height and historic use, the buildings all feature masonry facades, ground-floor storefronts, and uniform alignment that creates a uniform street wall. The buildings have housed a variety of commercial functions that include retail, office buildings, banking, post office, public library, industrial, saloon/restaurant, theater, hotel, and a social hall. The Fourth Street Railroad Corridor is the contributing structure, and a parking garage is the non-contributing structure. The following buildings are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Cedar Rapids Post Office and Public Building (1908), Security Building (1908), Sokol Gymnasium (1908), Lattner Auditorium Building (1910), Iowa Building (1914), Hotel Roosevelt (1927), and the Paramount Theatre (1928).

The union was founded in Liverpool in 1891, with the merger of local trade unions based in Belfast, Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool itself. There were also upholstery unions in London, but they did not affiliate. Initially, the union operated as a federation, with each branch deciding its own policy on welfare benefits for sick or unemployed members.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of British Trade Unions, vol.3, p.353 The union was certainly well established by 17 September 1892, when an illuminated scroll was presented to the President, Mr W D Lyons by the members of the \\"Society\\". This was in thanks for \\"the able manner in which you have discharged your duties as President during the past year.\\" There follow twenty names of Union members, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, etc. This scroll is now in possession of a descendant of Mr Lyons. Membership grew steadily, from 480 on formation to 681 in 1892, with four new branches formed including one in London, and by 1901 it was able to employ Lewis Leckie as its first full-time general secretary. Under his leadership, the union joined the Labour Representation Committee. He also tried to arrange a merger between it, the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association (NAFTA), the Amalgamated Union of Cabinetmakers and the Amalgamated Society of French Polishers, but discussions in both 1909 and 1913 failed as agreement could not be reached on levels of membership fees and benefits. The union became involved in demarcation disputes, but these were resolved by 1915, when it was permitted to rejoin the Trades Union Congress and affiliate to the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades. From 1918, it ceased to act as a craft union by admitting all workers in the trade, regardless of their perceived level of skill. It also began admitting women for the first time. By 1946, the union had only 900 members.Labour Party, Report of the Forty-Fifth Annual Conference of the Labour Party, p.78 The following year, it finally agreed a merger with NAFTA, which formed the National Union of Furniture Trade Operatives.

Campaigning Zhirinovsky Early developments =Initial campaign for the Soviet presidency= Zhirinovsky's campaign unofficially began shortly after the conclusion of the 1991 RSFSR presidential election. After retreating for several days to the town of Sofrino, Zhirinovsky made an announcement on June 20, 1991 that he would run in the election of the President of the Soviet Union, which was slated to be held in March 1995 (with some talk of potentially scheduling an early election for the spring of 1992). Zhrinovsky insisted that an early election for Soviet president would need to be held in April 1992. \\"I must win the elections,\\" Zhirinovsky warned a Moscovite journalist, \\"and I will win them. Otherwise it will mean civil war and dictatorship of the kind no scholar has ever described\\" Zhirinovsky's initial campaigning largely consisted of (almost daily) rallies held across Moscow. However, he also travelled to locations such as collective farms on the outskirts of Moscow as well as cities such as Krasanador, Leningrad, and Minsk. By November 1991 Zhirinovsky was seeking support from members of the military, offering promises to reward the army greatly in exchange for their support. However, Zhirinovsky's hope of being elected Soviet president quickly ended when the Soviet Union was officially dissolved in late December 1991. =Pivot to campaigning for the Russian presidency= After the fall of the Soviet Union, Zhirinovsky's ambitions turned back to the presidency of Russia, which was now the country's ultimate head-of-government. Zhirinovsky continued campaigning as though elections were soon approaching, despite the fact the presidential elections were not scheduled to be held until 1996. His campaign for a non-pending election drew the curiosity of reporters, particularly the foreign press. Covering one of Zhirinovsky's campaign trips to remote areas of Russia, British journalist Peter Conradi wrote, Zhirinovsky began to obtain a greater profile as a challenger for the next presidential election. Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk once remarked with concern, \\"We must clearly understand that after the Russia of Yeltsin may come the Russia of Zhirinovsky.\\" As early as 1992 Zhirinovsky began to adopt more antisemetic rhetoric in a bid to steal supporters from far-right extremist groups such as Alexander Sterligov's Russian National Congress, Gennady Kyruchkov's Russian Republican Party, Alexander Barkashov's Russian National Unity, and REKS (a group whose name derived from the acronym for a Russian phrase meaning, \\"Slash the Jews like dogs\\"). This ultimately proved to be a successful effort, as Zhirinovsky stole much of these groups support base by co-opting their bigotry. As a means of furthering his political aspirations, Zhirinovsky decided that he would run in the election for Mayor of Moscow. He announced his candidacy for mayor in December 1992. He re-adapted his presidential campaign platform to serve as his mayoral campaign platform. His pledge was to, \\"improve life quickly, to stamp out crime at last and to bring order to Moscow and then all of Russia.\\" Zhirinovsky made it clear that he saw the mayor's office as a potential stepping-stone towards the presidency declaring at a rally that he wanted to receive their support for mayor, \\"and, in the future, president of Russia.\\" His mayoral bid was ultimately unsuccessful. Soon after the end of the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, Zhirinovsky declared at a rally that, \\"If a situation occurs in which a military government will be formed‚Äîas a result of a military coup‚Äîwe, the LDP, will support it.\\" =1993 legislative elections= In the midst of the 1993 constitutional crisis, a Yeltsin had disestablished the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia, and scheduled elections in December to form Russia's new legislative bodies. While the Federation Council election was to be nonpartisan, the State Duma election would be partisan. Despite his third- place finish in the 1991 presidential election, experts had not expected for his Liberal Democratic Party to perform strongly in the legislative election. Polling conducted as late as a month before the election had shown his party with less than 2% support. At the tail end of the 1993 campaign, Zhirinovsky and his party saw an astonishing rise in support. Neither the liberal parties nor the communist parties were able to unite into solidified voting blocs. Democratic leaders had spent the election campaign fighting each other, rather than against opponents such as Zhirinovsky. Additionally, Zhirinovsky benefited from the fact that he had been actively campaigning (for president) for more than two years, and was able to quickly pivot his presidential campaigning towards legislative elections campaigning. Due to the fact that the 1993 legislative election was snap election, other parties had largely not been prepared to begin campaigning. Zhirinovsky also proved to have made effective use of television advertising. Additionally, the Russia's Choice bloc (which included Democratic Choice of Russia) made the mistake of deciding to run a minimal campaign. Ultimately, Zhirnovsky's LDPR placed first in the 1993 State Duma elections, receiving 22.92% of the proportional representation vote and being tied with Democratic Choice of Russia as the two parties to win most seats (both won 64 seats). The Duma election utilized two different forms of apportionment. Half of the seats were apportioned through party-list proportional representation. LDPR had won 22.9% of the proportional representation vote (placing first), earning it 59 of those seats (more than any party). The other half of the Duma's seats were filled by the direct elections of candidates by voters in single-member districts. The LDPR had received only 3% of the single-member district vote (placing fifth among parties) and received only 5 seats in single-member districts.Politika.su =Elevated political stature after the 1993 legislative elections= The strong performance of LDPR in the 1993 legislative election greatly bolstered Zhirinovsky's stature in Russian politics. It also raised strong concerns over Yeltsin's political future. In April 1994, a time when many Russian newspapers were writing premature political obituaries for Yeltsin, Zhirinovsky continued to recognize Yeltsin as his strongest opponent writing, While Zhirinovsky approved of many of Yeltsin's positions at this time (Yeltsin had co-opted aspects of Zhirinovsky's platform as part of a greater ploy to compete with Zhirinovsky's nationalist appeal) he ultimately felt that Yeltsin would be incapable of undertaking to two major steps that Zhirinovsky found necessary: restoring Russian control to the boundaries of the Soviet Union and dividing it into gubernii (turning the role of the president into that of a \\"father tsar\\"). Zhinovsky declared that the final push south would be \\"my chance, my mission\\". During this time Zhirinovsky found himself the victim of acts of sabotage by Kremlin operatives. In the summer of 1994 both Zhirinvosky and Yeltsin separately embarked on Volga River cruises in order to meet face-to- face with members of the Russian electorate. The Krelmin worked to sabotage Zhirinovsky's journey. When the LDPR flew to North Korea to meet with the new Kim Jong-il regime, the Kremlin denied his plane approval for a requested layover in Kemerovo. =Decline in political stature= While Zhirinovsky had, following the 1993 legislative elections, been seen as likely to lead the opposition to Yeltsin in the next presidential election, he subsequently fell out of favor. Some argued that had Zhirinovsky maintained a moderate and diplomatic profile while dealing with the Western media, he might have received some degree of tolerance, perhaps even support, from the West. However, Zhirinovsky's statements and interviews were so inflammatory that they drove away all such potential support he might have received. Following its performance in the 1993 legislative elections, Zhirinovsky's LDPR had the potential to be at the core of an organized opposition. Zhirinovsky struggled to sustain his party's electoral momentum after 1993, however. His violent antics in the Duma had the effect of disintegrating his party's credibility. Consequentially, Zhirinovsky's party declined in prominence. Ultimately, Zhirinovsky's faction split, by 1995, the LDPR found itself competing with the resurgent Communist Party for nationalist-leaning voters. Zhirinovsky's outlandish behavior had also largely removed him from serious consideration as a viable competitor for the presidency. Even as he began to organize his campaign, the disarray of his political party continued. In the early months of 1996 Zhirinovsky's party lost several key members, including Viktor Kobalev, who had been the head of the party's successful campaign in the 1993 legislative election. Official campaign Zhirinvsky was nominated at the LDPR congress on January 10, 1996. In February, at Zhirinovsky's behest, French nationalist politician Jean-Marie Le Pen traveled to Moscow to voice his support of Zhirinovsky's candidacy. In February, Zhirinovsky leant his endorsement to Pat Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate for the United States presidential election. Buchanan sought to distance himself from the controversial Zhirinovsky. After Buchanan distanced himself from this endorsement, Zhirinovsky attacked him, writing an open letter which said, \\"You turned out to be just like Clinton and other corrupt politicians, moved by greed and vanity, not by love for the fatherland...Pat, you're a piece of crap. You dumped in your pants immediately after getting my congratulations.\\" Zhirinovsky officially filed his candidacy on April 6. Zhirinovsky was generally not considered to be a frontrunner, and was polling in the single- digits. His campaign was officially registered four days later. In his first televised campaign advertisement, Zhirinovsky declared, \\"We don't need a collapsing and decaying Russia. We need a new Russia, a new course, a new policy\\". In his campaign, Zhirinovsky portrayed himself as the only alternative to Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov. Zhirinovsky was known to propagate an image centered around evoking a strong personality. Notorious for his flamboyance and outrageous stunts, on the campaign trail, Zhirinovsky delivered populist slogans accompanied by frequently by outrageous remarks. During his campaign, he was dismissed by some as an entertainer and a clown. Zhirnivosky's campaign team attempted to give Zhirinovsky a more serious, less buffoonish, reputation. However, these efforts were unsuccessful. Zhirinovsky was famous for his inflammatory nationalist rhetoric, which had caused Western observers and moderates in Moscow to view Zhirinovsky as him as a dangerous and destabilizing influence in Russian politics. Zhirinovsky used divisive rhetoric and appealed to resentments towards ethnic minorities in order to build support amongst ethnic Russias, the largest nationality in the Russian Federation's populace. In his campaign, Zhirinovsky promoted the idea of a \\"great Russia\\" surrounded by imperialists and spies, essentially laying the blame for Russia's shortcomings on sabotage. He peppered these allegations with blatantly antisemitic undertones. Zhirinovsky campaigned for the votes of prisoners. Zhirinovsky believed that he would be able to garner a strong enough support amongst incarcerated convicts to qualify him for the second round of the election. As a result, he visited prisons to campaign. When visiting prisons, Zhirinovsky went as far as promising to grant presidential amnesty to individual prisoners. Zhirinovsky's began running out of resources early into the official election campaign. In many regions, Zhirinovsky's campaign lacked the financial resources to establish an effective campaign organization. Consequentially, Zhirinovsky was ultimately unable to field a competitive campaign in many areas. Among the locations where Zhirinovsky failed to install a competitive campaign operation was the city of Perm. Zhirinvosky's party had won the vote in Perm several months earlier, in the 1995 legislative election. However, despite making a last-minute campaign visit in the closing weeks before the election, Zhirinovsky lost the city, coming third behind both Yeltsin and Zyuganov.http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~gusev/russian/vzbio.html Outcome Zhirinovsky received an even lower share of the vote than he had been predicted to. As had been anticipated in the polls, he failed to perform high enough to qualify for the second round of the election. To political observers, Zhirinovsky's performance seemed to indicate that he was no longer a political firebrand. Russian voters appeared to view him more as an entertaining figure than a feasible political leader. Zhirinovsky had lost much of his share of the nationalist vote to Lebed, who had performed surprisingly strong in the election. In some places Zhirinovsky managed to perform roughly as well as he had in his 1991 presidential campaign. For instance, in the Chelyabinsk Oblast Zhirinovsky received 5.23% of the vote, comparable to the 5.77% of the vote he had received there in 1991. However, even in Chelybinsk, Zhirinovsky underperformed when compared to the LDPR's performance there during the 1993 and 1995 legislative elections (LDPR had garnered 20.58% of the Oblast's vote in 1993 and 10.06% in 1995). Positions Zhirinovsky's positions trended towards the far-right of Russian politics. Zhirinovsky's positions were largely seen as fascist, however, Zhirinovsky himself sharply objected to such a characterization. In addition to being seen as a fascist, Zhirinovsky was also regarded to be an ultra- nationalist. Zhirinovsky's plans for reshaping the presidency essentially were to mold it into a dictatorship. The LDPR defined its members as being individuals who do not separate their personal interests from those of the motherland, a \\"creator capable of carrying out the priority tasks of the motherland aimed at preserving peace and raising the standard of living of all the population of our vast country.\\" Zhirinovsky had, during the 1993 legislative campaign, referred to LDPR as the, ‚Äúcenter-right party‚Äù, and claimed that its views were such that it could potentially be allied with Women of Russia and Civic Union in the State Duma. Zhirinovsky had a flair for demagoguery. His written policy positions tended to be far more moderate than those he espoused in speeches and interviews. Media Campaign videos and advertisements Whilst other candidates took advantage of their allocated free airtime by airing taped montages or scripted remarks, the videos that Zhirinovsky provided for his free airtime often sounded like he was speaking extemporaneously, often improvising and ridiculing the advertisements of rival campaigns. Among the television ads released by the campaign was an eleven- minute long campaign film with a dancing police officer, a tap-dancing professor and a singing pilot. Zhirinovsky's campaign posters included ones declaring him to be \\"Russia's last hope\\".

Emigrating to Iowa in the 1870s, he co-founded a lumber company in 1888. He advocated for lumbermen in several trade organizations, then was nominated by the Democrats to serve in the Iowa House of Representatives and later the Iowa Senate. Biography Arfst Frederich Frudden was born in Toftum, F√∂hr, Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark (later Germany) to Cornelius F. and Elke (Namens) Frudden on September 10, 1854. In 1871, following the Franco-Prussian War, he emigrated to the United States, ending in Clinton, Iowa. He worked on his cousin's farm near Sabula, Iowa for a year and a half. Some acquaintances that Frudden met during his emigration offered to give him a warehousing job in Clinton with Curtis Brothers & Company. In 1880, Frudden joined W. W. Carr & Company in Dubuque, Iowa. The next year, he rejoined Curtis Brothers as the foreman of their factory in Wausau, Wisconsin, staying there for three years. Frudden returned again to Dubuque and again worked for his previous employer there, now known as Carr, Ryder & Wheeler. By 1888, Frudden had saved enough to found his own company with his two sons and brother, the Frudden Lumber Company. Reorganized in 1894 as the Rumpf-Frudden Lumber Company, it grew to handle over 20 million feet of lumber per year. Frudden was active in trade organizations, rising to lead the Northwestern Lumberman's Association and Central Iowa Association in 1897. The next year, he rose to the presidency of the Eastern Iowa Association. In 1901, the Iowa Democratic Party nominated him to serve in the Iowa House of Representatives. He served there for three two-year terms, then was elected to the Iowa Senate, where he served until 1911. Frudden remained in Dubuque until 1919, when he retired to California. He married Philine Johannsen on November 30, 1877, and had seven children. He was a Shriner and 32nd degree Mason. He died in Beverly Hills, California, on April 8, 1931, and was buried in Linwood Cemetery, Dubuque.

It is known from one species, S. golmayensis, found in the Golmayo Formation. It lived between 138 and 130 million years ago was identified by a team of paleontologists in Spain. Discovery and naming The only known specimen of Soriatitan, S. golmayensis, was discovered in the Golmayo Formation (upper Hauterivian‚Äìlower Barremian) in Soria province, Spain. The material was found in the Zorralbo 1 deposit located in the vicinity of the population of Golmayo. Excavation began in 2000 by a team of paleontologists from the province of Soria, and preparation began in 2009, aided by the Din√≥polis Foundation. Description Size of Soriatitan golmayensis compared to a human The known material of S. golmayensis (MNS 2001/122) consists of one tooth, three dorsal vertebrae with ribs, a partial sacrum, five caudal centra, two caudal vertebral spines, one chevron, a humerus, an ulna, a radius, two partial ilia, two ischia, a fragment of a pubis, and a partial femur. It is estimated to have been 43‚Äì46 feet long (13‚Äì14 meters) and had an estimated weight of about 8 tons. Cladistic analysis has identified the known material as belonging to Brachiosauridae within Titanosauriformes. The known material shares similar characteristics with both European and North American brachiosaurids. It has similar anteriorly deflected anterior‚Äìmiddle caudal neural spines to Cedarosaurus, Tastavinsaurus, and Venenosaurus, and a proximodistally straight lateral margin between the proximal head and the humerus shaft with Cedarosaurus. The specimen was an adult with small 0.7 inch (18mm) teeth that indicates it was, like all other sauropods, a grazer. Fossilized remains of plants that lived at the same time as Soriatitan indicate that it lived in a subtropical climate in a landscape dominated by conifer trees, which would have been its main food source. The discovery of S. golmayensis, indicates that there was a presence of Early Cretaceous brachiosaurids in both North America and Europe, supporting the hypothesis of a connection between the tectonic plates of these continents at some point during the Early Cretaceous. S. golmayensis is the only known brachiosarid described from the Early Cretaceous of Europe. Until this discovery, it was thought that brachiosaurids had become extinct in Europe around 130 million years ago.

The game has several game modes for single and multi-player play, and additional cards, featuring more song samples, can be purchased as booster packs. Gameplay DropMix comes in a core package that includes 60 NFC-equipped cards, each representing a different song, and an electronic game board with five marked spaces; the game also requires a mobile device that can communicate with the board through Bluetooth through a free app. Additional cards enabling new music samples within the app can be purchased separately as booster packs, the price depending on the number of cards available. Each card is keyed to at least one of four colors, the colors representative of the instrument that can be sampled from that song. For example, yellow represents vocal tracks, while blue represents drum tracks. The board's five spaces are similarly marked by color, with three of the five spaces accepting cards of two different colors. Placing a card on a space with a matching color will cause that track sample to be used as part of the app's current mix; non-matching placement will have no effect. In addition, each card has a power level marking from one to three. In the app, this represents how much an influence the sample will have on the ongoing mix in terms of its speed, key or length. A card with 3 power will have a pronounced impact on the current mix compared to a card with a power of 1. Cards can be played on top of other cards or removed from the board, the app playing the sample only from the top-most card. Special white cards can be played on any space, which can cause an entire change in the speed and key of the ongoing loop. The app provides four game modes as of August 2018. \\"Freestyle\\" mode lets players simply try to combine the cards in various mixes without any other rules or scoring goals. In \\"Clash\\", two teams of either one or two players prepare card hands. Taking turns, each player plays a card by color as instructed by the app, but may only play a card of greater power than one already present (if such is the case). If they can, they earn points; if they are unable to, they hit a button on the game board which has the app determine cards to be removed from the game board to keep the game going. In \\"Party\\" mode, one to five players split the available cards between them, and taking turns, must try to respond to specific \\"requests\\" provided by the app in the fastest time, with score penalties if they play incorrectly. A patch released in August 2018 introduced \\"Puzzle\\" Mode, a solo game that combines the special actions of \\"Clash\\" mode with features of \\"Party\\" mode point building by using cards and the DropMix spinner to clear board elements. The game's soundtrack consists of licensed songs, as well as original compositions by Harmonix Music. At any time, players can save the current mix to the app and share that through social media. Cards are organized into \\"playlists.\\" Each playlist contains 15 cards. The Starter Pack comes with the board and 4 playlists. Dropmix cards can be purchased in one of two forms: Playlist Packs and Discover Packs. With Playlist Packs, you will receive 16 cards. 15 of the cards are listed (and make up a playlist) and the additional card is hidden and part of the Baffler playlist. With Discover Packs, there are 4 series. There are 6 packs of 5 cards per pack. The only way to distinguish packs from one another is from the images on the fronts of the packs, but each pack contains a specific set of cards. Each Series includes 30 cards (in total), and will complete only half of 4 playlist. 2 Discover Pack Series completes 4 playlist packs. Development DropMix was announced by Harmonix and Hasbro in March 2017, and was released in September 2017. Reception Accolades The game was nominated for \\"Best Family/Social Game\\" at the 2017 Game Critics Awards, and for \\"Best Mobile Game\\" in Destructoids Game of the Year Awards 2017.

Prince has described FSG's main corporate mission as helping Chinese businesses to work safely in Africa. The company operates logistical projects for shipping routes in Africa, and also conducts high-risk evacuations from conflict zones. According to FSG, it does not provide services involving armed personnel or training armed personnel. In some cases, it provides personnel and training to help non-military personnel provide close protection security, without the use of arms. However, critics have voiced concerned that Prince's work as FSG chairman has included efforts to sell paramilitary programs and services. FSG ended contracts with two of Prince's closest associates within the company after becoming suspicious that they were assisting Prince in unauthorized paramilitary contracts. J. David Whittingham is FSG's Group Vice President & Head of Africa. His responsibilities include business development, corporate development, mergers and acquisitions and investor relations. Frontier Services Group has ties to the CITIC Group, a state-run investment fund owned and controlled by the People's Republic of China. CITIC is FSG's largest shareholder. FSG has signed contracts to support China's One Belt and One Road initiative including building a series of bases in China's Xinjiang, where over a million ethnic Uyghurs, a Muslim minority in China, are being incarcerated in so-called re- education camps by the government, considered by many Americans one of the most egregious human rights abuses by China. Communist Party of China officials in Xinjiang reported that FSG's work would enhance the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Dr. Hua Dong Yi, was the key driver in investing the re-education camps. In May 2014, it was reported that Prince's plan to build a diesel refinery in South Sudan, in which $10 million had already been invested, was suspended. The halted refinery project was reported to be supported personally by the country's president, Salva Kiir Mayardit. Frontier Services Group was reported to be paid $23.3 million by South Sudan's Ministry of Petroleum to transport supplies and perform maintenance on oil production facilities. As part of Prince's Africa-focused investment strategy, Frontier Services Group purchased stakes in two Kenyan aviation companies, Kijipwa Aviation and Phoenix Aviation, to provide logistics services for the country's oil and gas industry. In October 2014, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority denied Kijipwa Aviation an aviation license renewal. Prince also purchased a 25% stake in Austrian aviation company Airborne Technologies. In 2014, Prince commissioned the company to modify Thrush 510G crop-dusters with surveillance equipment, machine guns, armor, and other weapons, including custom pylons that could mount either NATO or Russian ballistics. One of the modified crop-dusters was delivered to Salva Kiir Mayardit's forces in South Sudan shortly before a contract with Frontier Services Group was cancelled. Frontier Services Group owns two of the modified Thrush 510Gs, but since executives learned the craft had been weaponized by Prince, the company has declined to sell or use the aircraft to avoid violating U.S. export controls. In December 2016, FSG announced its plans to set up a ‚Äúforward operating base‚Äù in Yunnan to provide logistics and unarmed security training services to facilitate One Belt, One Road-related projects in Southeast Asia.

Biography  Peleg was raised in Ramat-Gan. He joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1976 and served as a paratrooper until his enrollment into medics' course. He completed his officer's training and was promoted as a medical organization officer. Peleg served in a number of positions in the Medical Corps of the IDF, including chief instructor at the IDF's medical training school and commander of the training facility of the Medical Corps. During the First Gulf War, he served as the head of the medicine branch at the civil defense directorate (nowadays: Home Front Command) and was tasked with overseeing the medical operations at the home front. Between 1997 and 1998, while in uniforms, he was lent to the Ministry of Health to serve as a senior consultant to the Minister, as well as a board member of Magen David Adom (Israel's Emergency Medical Services). Between 1998 and 2001 he was the commander of the IDF's Medical Training School. During this period he was tasked with the medical management of many mass casualty incidents throughout Israel. He was discharged from military service as an Army Colonel. Peleg holds a Bachelor's degree in politics, sociology and psychology from Bar-Ilan University, a Master's degree in public health with emphasis on health management from The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (Bethesda, Maryland), and a PhD in Health Administration and Policy from Ben- Gurion University of the Negev. Following his discharge from the IDF, he established the National Center for Trauma & Emergency Medicine Research at Gertner Institute. The center deals with the study of injury in Israel and abroad and is considered one of the leading research centers in the field of injury epidemiology, specifically in the field of mass casualty and terrorism. The center is also serving as the home of national trauma registry of Israel, which was established in 1995 by Vita Barell. Since its establishment, the center has published close to 200 papers in leading medical journals In 2005, Prof. Peleg co-established the Master's Program for Emergency and Disaster Management at Tel-Aviv University. In 2010, the program was expanded to include an international equivalent for foreign students. Since their establishment, these programs qualified hundreds of alumni who were incorporated into emergency management and humanitarian relief work in Israel and elsewhere. In 2008, he was appointed as an expert by the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination, a UN agency for international emergency response for sudden-onset emergencies. In parallel, he was tasked by the World Health Organization to serve as a mentor in the verification process of emergency medical teams responding to disaster-stricken regions. In 2017, he was elected chairperson of the board of directors of the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine. In addition, he holds several positions as board member in national and international committees, such as the Israeli National Committee for Mass Casualty Management.  Research contributions  In his position as the head of the National Center for Trauma & Emergency Medicine Research, Prof. Peleg led many groundbreaking and innovative studies in the field of disaster medicine and terror-related injuries. Among these is a pioneering study performed in the 1990s to develop an optimized, GIS-based model for reducing ambulances' response time in emergencies. This is one of the most cited papers in the field of disaster medicine and has become a cornerstone in designing ambulance architecture in many developed countries. Other important studies performed or led by Prof. Peleg concern differences in injury patterns between war and terror injuries, civilian versus military casualties, and gunshot compared to blast injuries. In addition, Prof. Peleg was also leading an innovative research that explored different reimbursement methods to influence higher survivability among hip fracture patients. The study was extensively cited and its outcomes led to health policy changes in Israel and abroad. Additional studies performed or led by Prof. Peleg brought about significant insights for the understanding of terror-related injury mechanisms, including the development of a new paradigm of injuries from terrorist explosions as a function of explosion setting type. Also among these are studies relating to characterization of injury patterns resulting from terror incidents and optimization of hospitals responses to mass casualty incidents. The research conducted by Prof. Peleg greatly contributed to Israeli and worldwide improvement of medical treatment of injuries resulting from mass-casualty incidents.  Humanitarian aid  Prof. Peleg is highly involved in humanitarian aid to disaster affected areas. In December 1988 he served as the deputy head of the medical delegation (field hospital) to Kirovakan (today: Vanadzor) in Armenia. In 1995 he participated and was responsible for the operational dispatching of the IDF's field hospital following the Rwandan genocide. In September 2009, he was dispatched as an UNDAC expert to assist the government of Indonesia in assessing the needs and coordinating international aid following the West Sumatra earthquake. Several months later, following the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, he joined the Israeli field hospital to extend medical aid to casualties. Similarly, in 2013, he participated in the Israeli field hospital dispatched to assist the victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. In 2015, he was again dispatched as an UNDAC expert to coordinate the medical relief to earthquake-struck Nepal, where he collaborated with other UN and WHO experts to establish a more robust mechanism for assessing medical needs and coordinating medical aid extended by international medical teams. The experience gained by Prof. Peleg in his humanitarian work brought him to suggest paradigm-shifting recommendations in the field of medical relief post disasters. In particular, Prof. Peleg is leading a global effort to expand mass training of the public in light search and rescue skills. This innovative approach to life saving following massive earthquakes draws from both academic sources and field experience.

In the Twin Peaks television series the Double R Diner is owned and managed by the character Norma Jennings, portrayed by actress Peggy Lipton. Twin Peaks character Shelly Johnson, portrayed by actress M√§dchen Amick, works as a waitress at the Double R Diner. The Double R Diner was also featured in scenes in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces, and Twin Peaks: The Return. History When filming began on the original Twin Peaks series in 1989, the Mar-T Cafe located in North Bend, Washington was used as the Double R Diner location in the series pilot and the prequel film Fire Walk With Me and served as the model for the Hollywood sound stage set where all other Double R Diner interior scenes were filmed. The restaurant was sold in 1998 to Kyle Twede ( ), who renamed it Twede‚Äôs Cafe. A fire gutted Twede‚Äôs Cafe in July 2000 and was the result of arson. News of the incident described the perpetrators as burglars who had set cafe ablaze to cover up their theft of $450. In an interview from May 2015, Kyle Twede described the arsonists as kids who had broken into the cafe to mess around and drink wine coolers and, fearing they would get in trouble, chose to set the place on fire. The interior was destroyed, while the exterior neon sign and the structure remained; Twede‚Äôs Cafe reopened in 2001 with a new interior that looked nothing like the Double R Diner. As of September 2015, as part of the production of the 2017 season of Twin Peaks, the series production company restored the interior of Twede‚Äôs Cafe to the original Double R Diner interior.

Published in New York, it was the first publication by a scientist to anticipate the adverse health effects, especially in relation to obesity and heart disease, of the public's increased sugar consumption. At the time of publication, Yudkin sat on the advisory panel of the British Department of Health's Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA). He stated his intention in writing the book in the last paragraph of the first chapter: \\"I hope that when you have read this book I shall have convinced you that sugar is really dangerous.\\" The book and author suffered a barrage of criticism at the time, particularly from the sugar industry, processed-food manufacturers, and Ancel Keys, an American physiologist who argued in favour of restricting dietary fat, not sugar, and who sought to ridicule Yudkin's work. In later years, Yudkin's observations came to be accepted. A 2002 cover story about sugar by Gary Taubes in The New York Times Magazine, \\"What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie?\\", attracted attention,Taubes, Gary (7 July 2002). \\"What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie?\\". The New York Times. and the following year a World Health Organization report recommended that added sugars provide no more than 6‚Äì10% of total dietary intake. In 2009 a lecture on the health effects of sugar by Robert Lustig, an American pediatric endocrinologist, went viral.Lustig, Robert (26 May 2009). \\"Sugar: The Bitter Truth\\", University of California Television (uploaded to YouTube on 20 July 2009). The subsequent interest led to the rediscovery of Yudkin's book and the rehabilitation of his reputation. Two further editions of the book were published, the second after Yudkin's death in 1995. An expanded version appeared in 1986, revised by Yudkin himself, to include much additional research evidence. In 2012 the book was re-published by Penguin Books with a new introduction by Robert Lustig to reflect the changed nutritional context that the book had helped to create.  Synopsis   1972 edition  John Yudkin, c. 1970 The book was first published in 1972 in New York by the publisher Peter H. Wyden under the title Sweet and Dangerous, and a few weeks later in London by Davis-Poynter as Pure, White and Deadly: The Problem of Sugar. Pure, White and Deadly was used for subsequent editions and is the title by which the book became known. At the time of publication, it was generally accepted that the alarming recent increase in the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was due to the excessive consumption of animal fat. Yudkin believed that this view was wrong and that, instead, an important cause of CHD was the excessive consumption of sugar (i.e. sucrose). More generally, he argued, excessive sucrose consumption provokes a metabolic disturbance that has several undesirable results. The author makes the initial case that sucrose is a dangerous food by emphasising the contrast between starch and sucrose. Both of these are carbohydrates, but starch occurs as a bulk constituent of cereals (such as rice, wheat and maize), legumes and a few root crops like potatoes, while sucrose is present in large quantities in sugar cane, sugar beet and ripe fruits. It used to be thought that sucrose and starch are metabolised in similar ways, and so are interchangeable from the nutritional point of view, but more recent evidence had shown that their metabolism is significantly different. The need for carbohydrate as a component of the diet can be entirely satisfied by starch (often in the form of bread or pasta), which is broken down in the body to glucose. On the other hand sucrose, which is broken down to equal quantities of glucose and fructose, is not an essential dietary component even in small amounts.For there being \\"no physiological requirement for sugar\\", see . Evolutionary history suggests that our pre-Neolithic ancestors ate a diet that consisted largely of meat, with some nuts, berries, leaves and root vegetables, and we can presume that a taste for sweet fruit developed because it directed people to a rich source of vitamin C, an essential nutrient. The development of agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution (from c. 10,000 BCE) led to a large increase in the consumption of starch, to which humanity adapted well. By contrast, it is only since the early 19th century that greatly improved methods of cultivation of sugar cane and sugar beet, and improved technology of refining, led to sucrose becoming readily available and remarkably cheap. Yudkin refers to these developments as the separation of palatability from nutritional value. As a result the quantity consumed has increased about 50-fold in the past 150 years, with sucrose increasingly used not only in the home and in caf√©s but also by the manufacturers of soft drinks and as a sweetening agent for many pre-prepared foods. The human species has not had time to adapt to this extremely rapid change. Three problems result. First, unlike glucose, which is metabolised throughout the body, the fructose produced from the breakdown of sucrose is metabolised almost exclusively in the liver, where much of it is converted to fat. Secondly, since it is not uncommon for people to take as much as 30 % of their daily caloric intake as sucrose, this consumption crowds out more desirable foods and can sometimes lead to deficiencies of certain nutrients. Thirdly, since many people find sucrose appetising, it is often taken in excess of caloric requirements, thus leading to obesity. The author then turns to the evidence that the consumption of sucrose is associated with certain specific disorders other than obesity. Some of this evidence is epidemiological and some experimental. Both types have limitations, which the author discusses in a chapter called Can you prove it?, but both are strongly indicative of an involvement of sucrose in the aetiology both of CHD and of what used to be called maturity-onset diabetes (type 2 diabetes). The epidemiological evidence that sucrose contributes to CHD had started to accumulate in 1957; in that year Yudkin showed that a comparison of data from several countries indicated an association between coronary mortality and the consumption of sucrose, and that the association with sucrose consumption was stronger than with fat consumption. Subsequent studies from South Africa and Israel found that sub-populations that had historically consumed only small quantities of sucrose had much less CHD than those who consumed large quantities, but that as their sucrose consumption increased so too did their incidence of CHD. Experimental evidence from animal studies showed that consumption of a sugar-rich diet leads to biochemical changes that are associated with CHD, such as an increase in blood triglyceride, an increase in platelet stickiness, and an accumulation of fat in the liver. Results similar to some of these were found in human subjects. Epidemiological evidence similarly pointed to excess sugar consumption as a contributory factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. As before, the evidence relied on a comparison between different countries in the incidence of type 2 diabetes and the consumption of sucrose, and also on within-country differences between sub-populations that consumed less or more sucrose. Moreover, in developed countries, the increase in sucrose consumption that had occurred over the past several decades appeared to run parallel to the increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Experiments with rats showed that the feeding of sucrose led to impaired glucose tolerance (results with human subjects were more equivocal). The author mentions several other conditions that he believed were caused by or exacerbated by the consumption of sucrose: dyspepsia (indigestion), dental caries, seborrhoeic dermatitis, changes in the refractive index of the eye, and various forms of cancer. With the exception of dental caries, none of these conditions showed as strong a link with sucrose consumption as CHD and type 2 diabetes did. How does the consumption of sucrose lead to these deleterious effects? For dental caries the answer is clear: it is converted to dextran, which is extremely adhesive and promotes the growth of acid-producing bacteria. For the general metabolic effects that lead to CHD and/or to type 2 diabetes, the author suggests that alterations either in the rate of production of insulin or in the body‚Äôs sensitivity to it may be one of the early effects of excessive sucrose consumption. This suggestion foreshadows the subsequent widespread recognition of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, and the condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is believed to result from the accumulation of fat in the liver‚Äîoften as a consequence of excess dietary sucrose. A chapter called Sugar should be banned suggests that sooner or later legislation will be needed to prevent people from consuming so much sucrose (this time foreshadowing the UK‚Äôs Soft Drinks Industry Levy or \\"sugar tax\\"). Yudkin concludes his book with some examples of the ways in which organisations connected with the sugar industry, and with the manufacturers of processed foods that use sugar, sought to interfere with his research or with its publication.  1986 edition  Fourteen years after the first publication of Pure, White and Deadly, Yudkin decided that the book was out of date in important respects, and in 1986 he published a new edition to incorporate more recent experimental results. The 1986 edition has many more references, and a much fuller index. In Chapter 12 of the new edition (Can you prove it?) he wrote about several experiments with human subjects in which fat intake had been manipulated by the reduction of animal fat; the results had not supported the fat hypothesis. Chapter 14 (Eat sugar and see what happens) described further experiments from Yudkin‚Äôs department at Queen Elizabeth College, both with experimental animals and with human volunteers fed on diets rich in sugar. Chapter 17 (A host of diseases) introduced a new section on disease of the liver. The inclusion of these additional results is one reason why the new edition (published by Viking in 1986 and by Penguin in 1988) is substantially longer than its predecessor. In addition, the author rearranged and expanded a good deal of the material in chapters 3, 4 and 5 of the 1972 edition, so that these three chapters (which largely concerned the chemistry of sucrose, methods for its production, and the difference between white and brown sugar) now became seven. In the last chapter, Yudkin gave many additional examples of the ways in which his research and the publication of his results had been impeded by the sugar industry and by organisations influenced by it.  2012 edition  The 2012 edition was published by Penguin under the title Pure, White and Deadly: How Sugar Is Killing Us and What We Can Do to Stop It. Yudkin's text is identical to that of the 1986 edition. In addition the new edition has an introduction by Robert Lustig, who had, independently of Yudkin, discovered some of the deleterious effects of sucrose, particularly in the aetiology of obesity in childhood. This edition of Pure, White and Deadly has been translated into German and Korean.  Reception  After almost half a century, it has become clear that Pure, White and Deadly was a transformative book, both because it re-shaped the scientific understanding of sugar and because it stimulated practical action for sugar reduction. The initial reception was very different. For decades after the book's initial publication in 1972, despite its sales and translations (into Finnish, \\"Puhdasta, valkoista, tappavaa. Kirja sokerista\\". Suomen Luontaisterveyden Liitto ry. German, \\"S√º√ü, aber gef√§rlich. Der Zucker-Report\\". Hoffmann und Campe. Hungarian, Italian, \\"Puro, bianco ma nocivo. Il problema dello zucchero\\". Edizioni Vitalit√†. Japanese and Swedish), Yudkin's arguments were rejected not just by the food industry but also by most of his scientific peers. Because of the lengthy delay caused by opponents (described below under Rejection), and the further time involved as others slowly began to appreciate the significance of sugar (described under Transition), sugar emerged as the principal nutrient of global concern only in the early years of the 21st century.  Rejection  When Pure, White and Deadly was first published, Yudkin was a member of the panel on diet and cardiovascular disease of the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA), then the principal scientific advisory body on nutrition for the UK government. It seemed an ideal opportunity to translate science into policy. In the event, Yudkin's colleagues on the panel did not accept his arguments, so he wrote a brief ‚Äúnote of reservation‚Äù for the final reportCommittee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (1974), Advisory Panel on Diet in Relation to Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease. Diet and Coronary Heart Disease. London: Department of Health and Social Security. Report on Health and Social Subjects 7 suggesting they had paid too much attention to fat and too little to sucrose. That a COMA panel had for the first time been asked to consider cardiovascular disease was itself a sign of the changes with which Pure, White and Deadly was concerned. As wartime privations receded and industrialised nations prospered, diets changed and the focus of nutrition changed too ‚Äì from deficiency diseases to problems of excess, what Yudkin called the ‚Äúdiseases of civilisation‚Äù. In many countries, governments and medical organisations began publishing dietary recommendations. Some included sugar among their concerns, but without specific reference to Pure, White and Deadly, or to Yudkin at all. Fat remained the principal issue. A review of 100 international nutrition reports up to 1991Cannon, Geoffrey (1992). Experts Agree: an Analysis of One Hundred Authoritative Scientific Reports on Food, Nutrition and Public Health Published Throughout the World in Thirty Years, Between 1961 and 1991. Consumers' Association, London found that 70 included quantitative targets for fat and only 23 for sugar. In the UK, the 1984 update of the COMA report on diet and cardiovascular diseaseCommittee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (1984), Panel on Diet in Relation to Cardiovascular Disease. Diet and Cardiovascular Disease. London: Department of Health and Social Security. Report on Health and Social Subjects 28 did not mention Pure, White and Deadly or Yudkin. And despite the much expanded 1986 edition of the book with new evidence, the separate COMA panel on ‚ÄúDietary Sugars and Human Disease‚Äù in 1989Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (1989), Panel on Dietary Sugars. Dietary Sugars and Human Disease. London: Department of Health. Report on Health and Social Subjects 37 explicitly dismissed any links between sugar and obesity, type 2 diabetes or heart disease.

WHO Technical Report Series 797. World Health Organization, Geneva in 1990 acknowledged sugar's role in the causation of dental caries, but not in obesity or CVD. Keys was referenced but not Yudkin. Similarly, the 1994 version of the COMA report on cardiovascular diseaseCommittee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (1994), Report of Cardiovascular Review Group. Nutritional Aspects of Cardiovascular Disease. London: Department of Health. Report on Health and Social Subjects 46 lists 414 references, but does not include Pure, White and Deadly among them.  Transition  For the general public, the most significant development was the increasing popularity of low- carbohydrate diets from the mid-1990s onwards. These created a generalised sense that there was something harmful about sugar and that people should eat less of it. Low-carbohydrate diets at that time were most strongly associated with Robert Atkins, himself a cardiologist who also suffered rejection by his medical peers. But many others produced variations on the theme, most notably Arthur Agatston, Barry Sears, Leslie Kenton, Patrick Holford and Jennie Brand- Miller. The trend continues in the 21st century in varied forms, including ketogenic and paleolithic diets. Yudkin received little acknowledgement for this development, even though he had published five books on weight loss, all emphasising sugar restriction, from 1958 to 1990, before any of the other popular low-carbohydrate diets were written. (See separate Wikipedia entry on John Yudkin for a bibliography). There was a similar lack of recognition in the scientific community. As we have seen, from the first edition of Pure, White and Deadly onwards Yudkin drew attention to the ‚Äúmetabolic disturbance‚Äù caused by excessive sugar intake, i.e. its effect on the production of insulin or on people‚Äôs sensitivity to it. But it was Gerald Reaven, another academic medical specialist, whose work stimulated research on and clinical attention to insulin, who later became known as the ‚Äúfather of insulin resistance‚Äù.Roehr, Bob (13 March 2018). ‚ÄúGerald ‚ÄúJerry‚Äù M Reaven: the 'father of insulin resistance'‚Äù. British Medical Journal 2018; 360:k1174 Reaven also linked this condition to broader health consequences, including heart disease, in what was known in those early days as ‚ÄúSyndrome X‚Äù (now more formally designated as the metabolic syndrome). Also food health advocacy NGOs became more visible during the 1990s, raising awareness of dietary problems. Some were particularly active on sugar ‚Äì notably the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) in the US and Action and Information on Sugars (AIS) in the UK, now succeeded by the more prominent Action on Sugar (AoS). But even these groups made little public reference to Pure, White and Deadly or to Yudkin. Throughout this period, both print and broadcast media gave increasing coverage to sugar. But the single most influential article was a cover story on the sugar v fat debate by Gary Taubes in The New York Times Magazine in 2002.Taubes, Gary (7 July 2002). \\"What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie?\\". The New York Times. His work also encouraged other journalists, including cookery writers, to publish articles on sugar. Today, articles, columns and programmes on sugar have become ubiquitous and are too numerous to count. The Wikipedia article on John Yudkin includes references to several articles on ‚Äò‚ÄôPure, White and Deadly‚Äô‚Äô in both the medical press and the lay press down to the year 2016. A more recent example, Fat didn‚Äôt have a lobby, appeared in December 2017 in S√ºddeutsche Zeitung Magazin. The developing case against sugar was also manifest in the 2003 version of WHO's \\"Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases\\", which recognised that there were good reasons for restricting sugar intakes to less than 10% of total calories, not just because of dental caries, but ‚Äúon nutritional grounds alone‚Äù. These grounds specifically included obesity. The subsequent controversy with the food industry over the global strategy to achieve this target was a turning point for some companies, who recognised that sugar and sweet products were now irremovably on the nutrition agenda. The real breakthrough came in 2009 with the lecture ‚ÄúSugar: the Bitter Truth‚Äù, by the paediatric endocrinologist Robert Lustig, broadcast on You Tube and viewed almost eight million timesLustig, Robert H. (July 2009). Sugar: The Bitter Truth on YouTube. University of California Television. Lustig's contribution was significant in several ways. First, it drew widespread public attention to the serious scientific case against sugar. It also broadened the nutritional concerns about sugar beyond obesity to all the diseases in the metabolic syndrome. Finally, it recognised the role that Yudkin had played in this long history, and hence was a major inspiration for the re-publication of Pure, White and Deadly in 2012, for which Lustig wrote an introduction. While he came to his clinical understanding of sugar independently, Lustig was more generous than any previous scientific workers in acknowledging his debt to Yudkin. Lustig ends his introduction to Pure, White and Deadly: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to be a Yudkin disciple, to contribute to resurrecting his work and his reputation, and to assist in the advancement of his legacy and public health message. Every scientist stands on the shoulders of giants. For a man of relatively diminutive stature and build, Dr John Yudkin was indeed a giant.‚Äù  Affirmation  Two major books have taken up the theme developed by Yudkin: Fat Chance by Robert Lustig (Hudson Street Press, 2013) and The Case Against Sugar by Gary Taubes (Alfred A. Knopf, 2017). These two books have added momentum to Yudkin‚Äôs call in Pure, White and Deadly for a substantial reduction in the consumption of sugar. In recent years, most major multinational food and drink manufacturers have begun implementing ‚Äúhealth and wellness‚Äù programmes which, amongst other actions, review and reformulate their product portfolios (thousands of products) to reduce sugar. Nestl√©, Unilever, Danone, General Mills, Kellogg's, Mars, Kraft Heinz, Mondelez and others have such plans, as well as, most significantly, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. The results are variable across companies, markets and product categories, and often criticised as inadequate or too slow. But significant reformulations in foods normally take many years. They have to be done gradually and imperceptibly, so as not to shock people's expectations and so as to carry established customers with them. For example, Heinz UK, an early responder to nutritional concerns, has been cutting sugar gradually across its range since 1986 and is still doing so. Sugar reduction in mass market foods is a transformative process that will take a long time. Government plans and policies on sugar are also changing. Earlier, the consensus target for sugar consumption was 10% of calories. In 2015, Yudkin's home country, the UK, set a goal of 5% of dietary energy,Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (2015). Carbohydrates and Health. The Stationery Office, London and WHO made this a ‚Äúconditional recommendation‚Äù for all countries.World Health Organization (2015). Guideline: Sugars Intake for Adults and Children, WHO, Geneva Explicit anti-sugar policies are being set in place. The most obvious manifestation has been taxes on ‚Äúsugar-sweetened beverages‚Äù. At the time of writing, some 59 countries have adopted some form of charge on sweetened drinks.Baker, Philip; Backholer, Kathryn; Huse, Oliver; Webster, Jacqui; Allemandi, Lorena; Engesveen, Kaia; and Nishida, Chizuru; \\"Government actions on packaged foods and drinks high in fats, sugars and salt\\" in Development Initiatives 2018, 2018 Global Nutrition Review, Bristol, UK, Development Initiatives. \\"The number of '59 countries' was collated by WHO from WHO Country Capacity Survey 2017, WHO Global Nutrition Policy Review 2016‚Äì2017, WHO GINA, World Cancer Research Fund International NOURISHING database'.\\" This is still a minority among nation states, but the number is growing. Their effectiveness varies. In many cases the charges are small, the data on sales and consumption are imperfect, and consequently the effects are disputed. The most powerful to date is again in the UK, with the Soft Drinks Industry Levy. It was structured with the intention not of suppressing consumption but of stimulating reformulation. So it took the form of a ‚Äúlevy‚Äù on manufacturers, not an excise tax at retail level. It was effective: most mass market drinks have reduced their sugar content to evade the levy.Winkler, Jack; Fry, Tam (14 May 2018). \\"Making the Healthy Choice the Cheaper Choice\\". BMJ Opinion, BMJ. The UK has also begun a programme to reduce the sugar content in popular sweetened foods (biscuits, breakfast cereals, cakes, chocolate, ice cream, pastries, puddings, sugar confectionery, sweet spreads and yoghurts).HM Government (2016). Childhood Obesity: A Plan for Action It is too early to tell if this will be effective ‚Äì many lower sugar products are still being developed and, in foods more than in drinks, reformulation is a long process. And it remains to be seen how many items will be commercially successful, which is a prerequisite for the success of reformulation as a public health strategy. Ironically, the most significant measure of Yudkin's increasing influence has come from the sugar industry itself. In 1964, aware of his arguments even before Pure, White and Deadly was published, the two big UK sugar producers (AB Sugar and Tate & Lyle) set up the Sugar Bureau (later Sugar Nutrition) to provide scientific counter-arguments on the health effects of sugar. In 2016, recognising that the public argument had been lost, they closed it down.Gore-Langton, Louis (9 November 2016). Sugar Nutrition UK: Born 1964, Died 2016. Food Navigator. William Reed Business Media, Crawley, UK Influence Although excessive sugar consumption is recognised as a major health issue, it is likely to remain a problem for decades ahead. The prevalence of obesity remains high in most developed countries. It is also rising in many developing societies, even those with widespread deficiencies, where it produces the ‚Äúdouble burden‚Äù of malnutrition. As yet, ‚Äúnot one single country has managed to turn around its obesity epidemic in all age groups‚Äù.Chan, Margaret, Director-General of the World Health Organization (10 June 2013). Opening address at the 8th Global Conference on Health Promotion, Helsinki, Finland‚ÄùNo country is on track to achieve the adult obesity target, for neither men nor women‚Äù. Development Initiatives (2018), 2018 Global Nutrition Report. Bristol, UK, Development Initiatives The burden of illness has shifted, in rich and poor countries alike, towards ‚Äúnon-communicable diseases‚Äù, including those of the metabolic syndrome associated with sugar. From a global perspective, sugar consumption is also rising, through growth in Asia and Africa, with India as the world's largest consumer in absolute amounts.Statista (2019) Sugar consumption worldwide in 2017/2018, by leading country in million metric tons It may not be falling even in the UK, despite all the government's efforts. Estimating real intakes is difficult, because diet surveys are flawed by ‚Äúunder-reporting‚Äù.The literature on under-reporting is voluminous. For a recent UK example, see Bailey, Rowena (15 February 2018). ‚ÄúEvaluating Calorie Intake‚Äù. Data Science Campus. Office of National Statistics website. Unsurprisingly, sugar production is rising in parallel, not only through more cane and beet, but also because of increased production of high fructose corn syrup/‚Äúisoglucose‚Äù, made from other starchy crops, like maize and wheat. Indeed, for all the attention to new policies to control demand for sugar, agricultural and trade policies continue to stimulate its production. Richardson, Ben and Winkler, Jack (2019) Sugar reduction in post- Brexit UK: A supply-side agenda FRC Food Brexit Briefing, Food Research Collaboration, Centre for Food Policy, City University, London. Nonetheless, the reformulation programmes of governments and companies should, over the longer term, gradually reduce consumption. One consequence of the emphasis on reformulation has been to stimulate the development of new food ingredients that may be used in place of sugar, especially in the technically more difficult changes to foods. These go well beyond the familiar ‚Äúartificial‚Äù sweeteners to include new ‚Äúnatural‚Äù sweeteners, superior polyols, better dextrins, improved oligo/poly-saccharides, sweet proteins, flavour enhancers, modifiers of taste receptors, and even new forms of sugar itself. As a result, new mass-market products with much reduced sugar contents, or even sugarfree, may become widespread.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 10 resources, which included seven contributing buildings and three non-contributing buildings. Cedar Rapids was platted on the east bank of the Cedar River as Rapids City in 1841, and it was incorporated in 1849. Kingston was established on the west bank of the river in 1852, and it was annexed by Cedar Rapids in 1870. The streets were laid out parallel and perpendicular to the river, which flowed from the northwest to the southeast. The Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska Railway, later the Chicago & North Western Railway, was the prominent railroad on the west side of town. The first bridge across the river at Third Avenue was built in 1871. The current bridge was completed in 1912. Prior to a bridge, Rapid City and Kingston were connected by a ferry operated by David W. King, the founder of Kingston. Initially residential, Third Avenue west of the river became increasingly commercial in the 1880s. The buildings that make up the historic district date from 1909 to 1942, and are representative of the various architectural styles and vernacular building forms that were popular during this time period. Two of the non-contributing buildings are more recent construction, while the third has been significantly altered. The buildings here are one to two stories in height and feature masonry facades, ground-floor storefronts, and uniform alignment that creates a uniform street wall.

It is a krater, a bowl made for mixing wine and water, and specifically a calyx-krater, where the bowl resembles the calyx of a flower. Vessels such as these were often used at a symposion, which was an elite party for drinking.  Description  Warfare depicted in Greek art was often not representative of actual ancient warfare, but rather depictions of epic and mythological scenes. This depiction style became common in the 6th century, possibly reflecting the political and social turmoil Greece was beginning to experience, and the desire to triumph over barbarians. In the 5th century, with the adoption of the novel red-figure vase painting technique, amazonomachies changed slightly, beginning to shift from depicting just the defeated to illustrating a real threat. This calyx-krater was made in the Classical Period of ancient Greece ca. 460-450 BCE. It is a red figure vase made of terracotta and attributed to the painter of the Berlin Hydria. The vase is from the region of Attika and is 21.9375 in (55.8) cm high and 22.9375 in (58.3) cm in diameter. The figures and poses seen are representative of the time in which it was made, evoking a sense of pathos and showing motion. The complexity and overlapping of items and figures evokes a dramatic representation of battle. From left to right there is a Greek soldier holding a raised spear and poised to strike. The next figure is a falling Amazon who is half hidden behind her shield. In the center there is a mounted Amazon sitting calmly on her horse.

M., & Zelazo, P. D. (2014). Minnesota Executive Function Scale: Test manual. Reflection Sciences, Inc.: St. Paul, MN. This work stemmed from her influential research investigating the relation between executive function and theory of mind in young children. Early experience and the development of executive function skills Professor Carlson's research has examined how variations in early experiences relate to later differences in the development of executive function skills. Children with better executive function skills (independent of intelligence) generally have higher quality sleep in infancy, receive more autonomy-supportive parenting from both mothers and fathers, receive non-punitive discipline, and are raised bilingual. In contrast, children with worse executive function skills are more likely to have a history of deprived care, such as experience in orphanages, and prenatal exposure to alcohol. The Batman effect Carlson's work has shown how imagination and symbolization contribute to children's developing decision- making skills. Together with former students Rachel White and Emily Prager, and colleagues Angela Duckworth and Ethan Kross, Carlson has shown that asking children to role-play as if they were an exemplary character (e.g., Batman), which creates psychological distance, increases kindergarten children's executive function scores by the equivalent of 1 year of development, and helps them to resist a tempting video game and persist longer at tasks.  Selected honors  Carlson is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the American Psychological Association (Division 7, Developmental), where she received the Dissertation Research Award (1995), and past Vice President of the Jean Piaget Society.

It operate from 1884 until 1965.  History  Iron ore quarrying flourished throughout the East Midlands ore field throughout the 1860s and 1870s. By the early 1880s, a thriving quarrying industry had established itself in northern Leicestershire, working an outcropping of Marlstone that ran north-east from the village of Holwell to the edge of Belvoir Castle. The companies working these ore fields needed better freight transport to take ore to their customers around the United Kingdom. In 1882, the Great Northern Railway (GNR) applied to parliament to build a branch line from their Waltham Branch immediately south of Waltham-on-the-Wolds railway station northwards towards Eaton. In November 1883, the GNR applied for a second act, extending the Eaton Branch to \\"...a field belonging to, or reputed to belong to, His Grace the Duke of Rutland... adjoining the road leading from Belvoir to Eastwell, at a point about 220 yards measured in a north-westerly direction from Shelton's Barn.\\". The branch was under construction in 1883, and opened sometime in 1884. The branch served a series of quarries along its short route. The Holwell Iron Company was quarrying the ore fields to the south and west of Eaton village, while the Waltham Iron Ore Company worked fields that stretched to the west and north of the branch's northern terminus. The branch had no passenger stations and carried no passenger traffic throughout its life: it operated purely as an industrial railway. The branch became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in the railway grouping of 1923. It then became part of British Railways in 1948. It continued in operation until closure and lifting in 1965.  Route  The Eaton Branch Railway began at \\"Eaton Junction\\", immediately to the south of Waltham-on-the-Wolds station. It curved leftwards to run north-west on an embankment, gaining height above the surrounding fields. It then crossed Green Lane on an overbridge. North of this bridge, the line curved to the north, still on an embankment. The Eastwell Branch left the line at the start of this curve, just north of Green Lane. It is probable that this was never used apart from a short section near to the junction used as a siding. Certainly by 1903 a narrow gauge line had been built on its formation by the Eastwell Iron Ore Company. The standard gauge siding was used to supply equipment to the quarrying company, whose narrow gauge line was extended to serve quarries at Eaton and Branston. All the ore from those quarries and those at Eastwell was taken via the narrow gauge line including a cable operated incline to sidings at the Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Line near Harby. North of this siding there was a timber viaduct on the Eaton Branch, which was filled in in 1955 with slag from Holwell Iron Works to form an embankment which can still be seen. The line then entered a cutting and passed under the Eaton to Stathern road, immediately on the west side of Eaton village. Just past the road bridge, was a loading stage for the tramways of the Holwell Iron Ore Company's tramway. There were pits on both sides of the line as it headed nearly due north. Once more entering a cutting, the railway passed under the Belvoir Road at the junction with Toft's Lane, and terminated in a run-round loop and sidings serving the loading stage of the Waltham Iron Ore Tramway.

Hittell, 25 December 1825 ‚Äì 8 March 1901) was an American author, historian, and journalist of the United States during the Golden Age of Free Thought. Hittell wrote on a wide variety of topics including history, mining, Christianity, Pantheism, phrenology, morality, and politics. He is best known for his works A History of The City of San Francisco and Incidentally of the State of California (1878) and The Evidences Against Christianity (1856).  Life and career   Early life and education  John Shertzer Hittell was born December 25, 1825 in Jonestown, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania to Catherine Mueller Shertzer and Jacob Hittell. Both parents were of German descent in families which came to America long before the American Revolution. His family moved to Hamilton, a town in Southwestern Ohio, in 1832. His brother Theodore H. Hittell was an author and historian who met and wrote about the life of John \\"Grizzly\\" Adams in his book The Adventures of James Capen Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California. Starting in 1839, Hittell attended Miami University and learned Latin, Greek, French, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Rhetoric. He obtained a Masters of the Arts degree in 1843. After graduating, Hittell decided to go into Law and entered the office of John Woods, a leading attorney in Hamiltin. His studies were interrupted by dyspepsia and headaches which Hittell attempted to cure by long walks and working on a farm in Hake County, Indiana.  Gold mining  In the spring of 1849 during the excitement of the Gold Rush he left the bank of the Missouri River with a company of adventurers en route to California. They arrived at the Sacramento River on Sept. 19th. Hittell spent the winter of 1849 and 1850 at Reading's Diggings (Shasta County). He would go on to write books on mining with Mining in the Pacific states of North America (1861) and Hittel on Gold Mines and Mining (1864) respectively.  Move to San Francisco and writings  In 1852, Hittell moved to San Francisco and in 1853 joined the editorial staff of the \\"Alta California\\", where he remained employed for the following 25 years. Hittell was the author of numerous books concerning California history, resources, and industries. He became one of the editorial writers of the Alta California newspaper, a position which he held, though not continuously, for more than twenty-four years. He was known as a hard worker and careful student, as was soon recognized as an authority in matters relating to the industries and resources of the State. In 1862 he published a book called \\"The Resources of California,\\" and the seventh edition of it appeared in 1879. \\"A History of San Francisco,\\" from his pen, was issued in 1878. Her has written several other books, numbering at least half a dozen, and has contributed much to cyclopedias and magazines. His range of knowledge was wide, including familiarity with the literature and tongues of Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. He has been credited with being among the group of people to name Lake Tahoe. Hittell owned land on Mount Diablo in a location known as Deer Flat. In 1873 an entrepreneur known as J.S. Hall, who had owned and conducted the famous Summit and Tip-Top House in Washington, approached Hittell about building a hotel, and constructing a carriage road to the summit of Mount Diablo. The two failed to come to satisfactory terms, with Hall finding a new place for the construction. In 1867 Hittell filed a patent for a new Washing Machine which he described as \\"consisting of an upright paddle-wheel common wash-tub, and is much more expeditious than the Wash-board\\".  Works of fiction  In 1878 Hittell wrote versions of famous stories, adding in his own characters and plot. These were Regolstein: A Comedy (1878), based on La Grande-Duchesse de G√©rolstein and Tannwald: A Drama based on Goethe's Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  Translations of works by Carl Reichenbach  Hittell undertook the first English translations of two works by author Carl Reichenbach. These were Odic-Magnetic Letters and a section of the large work, The Sensitive Man and His Relation to Od, titled Somnambulism and Cramp.  Religious views andwritings  Hittell was a known freethinker in the early Freethought movement as well as a Pantheist as described in his book A Plea for Patheism. Of his more well known books is The Evidences Against Christianity. Upon hearing that Hittell was to write a series of lectures against Christianity, famed early leader of the Latter Day Saint movement Parley P. Pratt sent him a letter. They appeared to be good friends with Pratt mentioning in reply to one Rev. Mr. Briggs in which Pratt was defending his polygamy against attacks made by Briggs, states:  Works  *The Evidences Against Christianity (Volume 1, Volume 2, 1856) *A Plea for Pantheism (1857) *A New System of Phrenology (1857) *A Brief Statement of the Moral and Legal Merits of the Claim Made by Jos Y (1857) *Mining in the Pacific states of North America (1861) *Hittel on Gold Mines and Mining (1864) *The Resources of California (1867) *Yosemite: Its Wonders and Its Beauties (1868) *The Resources of Vallejo (1869) *All About California, and the Inducements to Settle There (1870) *A Brief History of Culture (1875) *A History of The City of San Francisco and Incidentally of the State of California (1878) *Regolstein: A Comedy (1878) Translated and altered from the French text of the buffoon opera, \\"The grand duchess of Gerolstein,\\" by H.

Police brutality refers to the intentional use of excessive force by a police officer, be it physical, verbal, or psychological. Police corruption is a form of police misconduct where an officer obtains financial benefits and/or career advancements in exchange for not pursuing, or selectively pursuing, an investigation or arrest. Police misconduct refers to inappropriate actions taken by police officers in connection with their official duties. Sex workers, particularly poor sex workers and those who had been manipulated, coerced, or forced into sex work, are at risk of being obliged or otherwise forced to provide free sexual services to police officers out of fear of being harmed or arrested. Some sex workers have reported that they have encountered police officers who have physically assaulted them without evidence of a crime and without making an arrest. Studies have been conducted to examine the extent and frequency of abuse experienced by sex workers in the United States. Steven D. Levitt and Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh have noted that there has been difficulty in obtaining reliable data due to prostitution being largely illegal in the United States, rendering standard data sources uninformative. Concerns have been raised about the health and rights of sex workers and the role police have in either improving or worsening them by utilizing prostitution law, with some critics stating that in areas such as Washington D.C. the laws effectively \\"legitimized unconstitutional police behavior that had long existed in the District.\\" Police abuse can have long-lasting consequences. Sex workers who are forced to move to another area can end up in areas where they feel less safe, and there have been reports of disrupted medication routines and medical schedules due to arrests. Organizations such as Human Rights Watch have stated that police abuse in countries such as the United States has led to sex workers becoming distrustful of officers, deterring them from reporting attacks from clients, and are one of the primary sources of violence. Some sex workers have further reported that they see the legal system as being unhelpful, as they feel that the system does not provide them with access to resources, that it pressures them to accept guilty pleas even when innocent, and the process of arrest and trial is humiliating.  Street prostitution  Sex workers may engage in street prostitution for a multitude of reasons; one of the most intrinsic reasons is as a survival tool against poverty. Socialist feminists have cited \\"oppressive capitalistic processes for why women enter into street prostitution.\\" Certain communities are more vulnerable to prostitution. In the United States there are many street prostitutes who are black or belong to another ethnic group and/or who may be uneducated and impoverished due to inequity and lack of resources due to factors such as race and class. Radical feminists have argued that the marginalization of poor women of color has made it more likely for them to be led into prostitution. Some critics have stated that police officers have dehumanized sex workers and Amnesty International has noted that in the past Los Angeles police officers would mark cases involving sex workers, especially black sex workers, as N.H.I. - \\"No Human Involved\\". In New York if a cop suspects you are a prostitute and your caught carrying a condom an officer can arrest you for soliciting sex. Scholar Jacquelyn Monroe has noted that prostitution laws are unevenly enforced and that sex workers engaging in street prostitution are more at risk of being arrested, while sex buyers are not. Research has also stated that there is a sex stigma named \\"whore-stigma\\" attached to street prostitution that reinforces hierarchies and dehumanizes street prostitutes and that harassment is pervasive. Sex workers have reported \\"experiencing verbal degradation, cursing, insults, and racial slurs from the police\\" and being harassed when engaging in non-criminal activities. They have also reported that they are reluctant to report crimes against them such as rape, as they state that there is a risk of them being ignored or receiving punishment such as fines, incarceration, or deportation instead. Society's social construct of sex workers historically; been given the role of social outcast someone to be ignored and dismissed. Because of this social construct it subconsciously legitimizes their \\"otherness\\" to society. With these perceptions society can stigmatize and dehumanize the prostitute. As stated earlier this is one of the contributing factors into \\"whore-stigma.  Decriminalizing sex work  Some international public health and human rights organizations have pushed for the decriminalization of sex work, stating that it would allow sex workers to work in safe conditions while also improving access to legal and health systems. Proponents have also argued that it can contribute to reduced stigma, discrimination, and marginalization that comes with being a sex worker, as well as curbing the abuse experienced by police officers. There are also concerns that continued criminalization makes it more difficult for sex workers to escape the industry, as multiple fines, imprisonments, and criminal records make it difficult to find legal employment and resources, leaving the worker with few other avenues to make money. Organizations such as the Global Health Justice Partnership and Sex Workers Project Of the Urban Justice Center have performed research to understand how the criminalization of prostitution impacts the lives of sex workers. Concerns with decriminalization is that this would not immediately eliminate sex work stigma or the violence, substance use, or economic marginalizing that can characterize the lives of sex workers. Jennifer Toller Erauquin has noted that the government must make a concentrated effort to decriminalize sex work and to change policing practices when it comes to sex workers, as police have a responsibility to ensure public safety, including the safety of female sex workers. Ine Vanwesenbeeck has noted that in order to decriminalize sex work the government and society have to acknowledge that sex work is work. She argues that this would empower sex workers by reducing the stigma and violence that they experience and that as other countries have introduced regimes of partial legislation, this can be done in countries such as the United States.  Notable instances of violence   Daniel Holtzclaw  On June 18, 2014 Oklahoma City Officer Daniel Holtzclaw pulled over a 57-year-old woman and forced her to perform oral sex upon him. The woman, who had no prior records, filed a police report the following day and in the following investigation Holtzclaw was charged with 36 counts of sexual abuse offenses including rape in the first and second degrees, sexual battery, procuring lewd exhibition, stalking, and forcible oral sodomy. He was brought to trial and convicted on 18 out of the 36 counts and sentenced to 236 years in prison. During the trial prosecutors stated that Holtzclaw specifically targeted women in poor communities who had drug or prostitution records, as he assumed that they would be unlikely to file a report.  Celeste Guap  In 2017 the Oakland City Council agreed to pay a settlement of nearly one million dollars to Celeste Guap, a former underaged prostitute. Guap stated that she had been exploited and sexually assaulted by approximately two dozen officers from the Oakland, Richmond, Livermore, and Contra Costa County departments, which included encounters prior to her reaching the legal age of consent. Guap has further expressed an unwillingness to testify due to fears for her own safety as she still resides in the Bay Area where the crimes were committed.

Biography  Alex Garc√≠a, born in Mexico City, is the grandson of Arturo de C√≥rdova, a noted actor from the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. He has a degree in business administration. He started out professionally in finance and investments. He eventually created an investment fund and acquired several businesses with the intention of restructuring their business plans and selling them. The first was the PanArte bakery, now a brand of processed foods dealing with several self-service chains. The second was √Ånima Estudios, a pioneer in the field of animation in Mexico. This company's first big project under Alex Garc√≠a was the production of the animated series El Chavo del Ocho, based on the comedy of Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os, one of the most viewed Mexican programs in Latin America.  Career  Standouts among Garc√≠a's films include Matando Cabos, a modern Mexican film comedy that took in 62 million pesos during its first run in 2004; the horror film Kilometer 31, with an audience of more than 3 million viewers in Mexican theatres in 2007; and the previously mentioned Brazilian action film Elite Squad, which earned more than 30 festival prizes worldwide, including the Golden Bear at the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival. The Colombian co-production The Snitch Cartel was Colombia's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 85th Academy Awards. No s√© si cortarme las venas o dej√°rmelas largas, the directorial debut by the Mexican director Manolo Caro, came in third at Mexican box offices in 2013. The drama Nightingale was nominated at the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in the categories of Outstanding Television Movie and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. Since then he has ventured into the production of television series such as 13 Miedos, Param√©dicos for Canal Once, and Sr. √Åvila and Dios Inc., both for HBO. He has, in addition, produced music videos for artists such as Natalia Lafourcade, Jenny and the Mexicats, Enrique Iglesias, and Daddy Yankee. His work as producer includes the documentary Carriere, 250 metros, by directors Natalia Gil and Juan Carlos Rulfo. This project, about the live of the Frenchman Jean Claude Carriere, well-known author, screenwriter, and playwright, who wrote many of the films directed by Spanish filmmaker Luis Bu√±uel, is listed as the most expensive documentary in the history of Mexican documentary films. Its production cost 14 million pesos. In 2015, he released the full-length film Words with Gods, a compilation of several short films exploring the notion or concept of God among different cultures around the world. The original idea came from Mexican filmmaker Guillermo Arriaga, who directed one of the stories. Other participating directors include Alex de la Iglesia, Emir Kusturica, and Hideo Nakata. The project featured curation by Mario Varga Llosa and a score by Peter Gabriel. Alex Garcia has also been actively involved in the production of television series. Among his projects we can find; ‚ÄúCronica de Castas‚Äù, ‚ÄúSr. Avila‚Äù and ‚ÄúDios Inc.‚Äù, both produced for HBO, ‚ÄúLucha Underground‚Äù (4seasons) for El Rey Network, ‚ÄúThe First‚Äù starting Sean Penn for Hulu, ‚ÄúLeyend Quest‚Äù (animation) currently in its third season for Netflix, ‚ÄúSpace Chicken from Space‚Äù (animation) first season for Disney, ‚ÄúChapulin Colorado‚Äù (animation) currently in the third season, ‚ÄùEl Chavo‚Äù (animation) of which six seasons were released. Alex Garcia was honored with Visionary Award (2016), from Hollywood Reporter and Winston & Baker for his valuable contribution to the world of show business and his great vision in creating international media ventures. During 2018 and 2019, Alex has focused production around South America, mostly Colombia and Chile, were his company AG Studios Colombia has produced Tv Series such as ‚ÄúIngobernable‚Äù for Netflix, ‚ÄúLa Reina del Sur‚Äù for Telemundo/Netflix and ‚ÄúJack Ryan‚Äù for Paramout/Amazon and feature films for most studios in the US and Europe.

This genus was created to accommodate its type species, Durinskia baltica, after major classification discrepancies were found. While Durinskia species appear to be typical dinoflagellates that are armored with cellulose plates called theca, the presence of a pennate diatom-derived tertiary endosymbiont is their most defining characteristic. This genus is significant to the study of endosymbiotic events and organelle integration since structures and organelle genomes in the tertiary plastids are not reduced. Like some dinoflagellates, species in Durinskia may cause blooms.  Etymology  The genus Durinskia was named in honor of Rose Durinski by Carty and Cox in 1986.  History  The representative species of Durinskia is Durinskia baltica, which was also the impetus for the genus‚Äô creation in 1986. Durinskia baltica was originally described as a brackish water unicellular dinoflagellate and named as Glenodinium cinctum by Levander in 1892. Upon revisiting his work in 1894, Levander renamed Glenodinium cinctum as Glenodinium balticum after revising his previous work. In 1910, Lemmermann reclassified Glenodinium balticum under a freshwater dinoflagellate subgenus called Cleistoperidinium. One of the defining character of Cleistoperidinium is its lack of an apical pore, a criterion Durinskia baltica does not fulfil. To rectify this mistake, Durinskia baltica, known then as Glenodinium balticum, was transferred into the subgenus of Orthoperidinium in 1937. Species within Orthoperidinium are characterized by their four-sided apical plate which is not a character of Durinskia baltica either. The taxonomic hierarchy changed, Durinskia baltica, referred as Peridinium balticum at the time, was transferred to the genus of Peridiniopsis (Bourrelly 1968) and renamed as Peridiniopsis balticum. Upon an investigation conducted by Carty and Cox (1986), Durinskia baltica was determined to belong in a different genus than Peridinium. While the representative or type species of both Peridinium and Durinskia baltica have five cingular plates, the irregular arrangement of the cingular plates in D. baltica differs from the typical cingular plate alignment with postcingular plates in Peridinium. Note that cingular plates are cellulose plates that make up the transverse groove, cingulum, in the outer armor of the organism, whereas precingular plates are plates that form part of the outer armor that is above the cingulum, and postcingular plates are plates that form the outer armor that is below the cingulum. More importantly, all species in Peridinium have seven precingular plates rather than six precingular plates as in D. baltica. After the discovery of these significant morphological differences, a new genus named Durinskia was accepted to accommodate D. baltica. Because some species previously described were misclassified under other genus prior to the establishment of Durinskia, many species that belong in Durinskia have yet to be reclassification or discovered. Durinskia capensis is one of the species that was recently discovered by revisiting previous literature whereas Durinskia agilis was reclassified based on morphology and molecular genetics in 2012.  Habitat and ecology  As of 2017, there are at least four species classified under the genus Durinskia. The known species of this genus, D.baltica, D. oculata, D. agilis and D. capensis, can be isolated from a variety of freshwater and marine habitats. The type species of genus Durinskia, D. baltica, inhabits brackish water and marine environment in Europe, North America, South America, Oceania and Pacific Islands. D. oculata can be found at its type locality (Vltava river at Prague), but also in Ampola Lake in Italy. Orange-red blooms of D. capensis are observed in salty tidal pools along the west coast of Kommetjie, Cape Province, South Africa. D. agilis is a species of sand-dwelling benthic marine dinoflagellate first isolated from the coast of Kuwait. The presence of tertiary plastids (chloroplasts) indicates that species in Durinskia are phototrophic. Although predation is not recorded in recent literature, the relatively recent acquisition of its tertiary plastid in Durinskia indicates organisms must have been trophic at the time of its tertiary endosymbiosis.  Description of the organism As this genus containing species is part of the subphylum Alveolata and phylum Dinoflagellata, it has the defining characteristics of these groups. As in all alveolates, species in Durinskia have flattened vesicles known as alveoli under the plasma membrane. One of Durinskia‚Äôs shared characteristics with some dinoflagellates is the cellulose plates contained in alveoli forming the outer armor, theca. The other shared characteristics between Durinskia and dinoflagellates include the presence of condensed chromosomes in the large nucleus called the dinokaryon, and the two surface grooves that each bears one flagellum. The transverse surface groove is called the cingulum which runs laterally around the whole organism, whereas the other groove, sulcus, starts from ventral midpoint of the cingulum vertically down to the posterior end of the organism typically. The cingulum is a useful morphological feature in discerning species. For instance, the angle of descent of the cingulum varies among species. The theca is also separated by the cingulum into epitheca for theca above the cingulum and hypotheca for theca below the cingulum. The red eyespot functions as a lens that allows organisms to respond to visual stimulation. While eyespots and plastids are found in both groups, the origin of these structures differ as discussed the tertiary plastid section. The following are some major discerning features of Durinskia. Species in Durinskia are mostly ovoid. The apical pore in one Durinskia species is a slit-like pore that is located at the apex of the epitheca. The epitheca is either similar in size or slightly longer than the hypotheca. There are no ornaments on the smooth and thin theca in this genus. The cingulum slightly descends downward toward the medial of the organism by around half its width. The sulcus is narrow and may widen as it extends to the posterior end of the organism as in D. agilis. The plates that form the theca immediately above and directly below the cingulum are called the precingular plates and postcingular plates respectively. In the genus Durinskia, organisms have 6 precingular plates and 5 postcingular plates; the cingulum and sulcus is composed 5 unequal plates and 6 plates respectively. Although the shape of the plates varies among species, all species have cingular plates that do not align with the postcingular plates. Since the position of the large nucleus (dinokaryon), shape of the eye spot, and the number and shape of chloroplasts may vary among species, the most reliable method of identification is to observe tabulation pattern of thecal plate. The most interesting feature of Durinskia is the presence of its tertiary plastid which originated from a pennate diatom. Durinskia‚Äôs tertiary plastid is sometimes confused with the tertiary plastid in Peridiniopsis penardii, which originated from a centric diatom since both plastids have four membranes. As a reminder, a plastid is an endosymbiont that has been incorporated into the host as an essential organelle, and a pennate diatom is elongated in valve view whereas a centric diatom is circular.  Tertiary plastid  As mentioned above, the origin of the plastids in Durinskia is different from the origin of the secondary plastid present in other typical dinoflagellates. In multiple secondary endosymbiotic events, an alga with a primary plastid was integrated into a eukaryotic host as a secondary plastid. The common red plastid found in dinoflagellates is a red secondary plastid that is different as it is bound by three rather than four membrane. These red plastids also contain peridinin, a major carotenoid pigment specific to dinoflagellates. In Durinskia, the function of the secondary red plastid is replaced by incorporating a diatom and its diatom‚Äôs plastid as a tertiary endosymbiont. The diatom-derived tertiary plastid in Durinskia is not as reduced as other plastids where the secondary host components are completely reduced and only the plastid remains. In addition to retaining the nuclear genome and the large nucleus of the diatom, the diatom‚Äôs mitochondria and mitochondrial genome, cytosolic ribosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum are retained. However, the diatom can no longer function as a separate entity as it has lost its cell wall, motility and ability to mitotically divide. Moreover, the synchronized division of the cryptic diatom and the host Durinksia indicates the process of integration. Durinskia‚Äôs tertiary plastid has retained thylakoids that stack in threes and is found to have Chlorophyll a, c1, and c2 and fucoxanthin, a pigment expected of a diatom It has been proposed that the original secondary red plastid in Durinskia has been repurposed as an eyespot after the acquisition of the tertiary plastid. This proposition stems from the observation that Durinskia eyespots resemble the membrane surrounding peridinin-containing plastids as in dinoflagellate‚Äôs secondary red plastids, and both structures are both triple- membrane bound  Importance in research and ecology  The retention of the nuclear and mitochondrial genome of the diatom-derived plastid in Durinskia has been the well-studied in studies that investigate tertiary endosymbiosis events and symbiogeneis. In Cape Peninsula, Durinskia capensis blooms causes orange-red blooms in tidal pools.

Commemorative plaque for the 350th anniversary of the launch of the carrosses √† cinq sols in Paris; this plaque is located in Clermont-Ferrand, the birthplace of Blaise Pascal. The carrosses √† cinq sols (English: five-sol coaches) were the first modern form of public transport in the world, developed by mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal. History Paris in the era of Louis XIV was one of the world's most populous cities (with Beijing, London and Constantinople): it contained more than five hundred thousand residents in 22,000 residencies, five hundred major roads, 100 public squares, nine bridges. The narrow Parisian road network, dating from medieval times, did not make the establishment of public transportation attractive, but in spite of this, a few attempted to organise a modern public transit network. In a corporation founded in In November 1661 on the initiative of Blaise Pascal, with the participation of the Duke of Roannez (governor and lieutenant-general of the province of Poitou), the Marquis de Sourches (knight of the king's orders and Grand Provost of the Hotel), and the Marquis de Crenan, the entrepreneurs presented a request to establish an operator for \\"carriages which would always make the same journeys...and would always leave at scheduled times\\".Jean Robert, Les tramways parisiens, p. 28 The system of carrosses was approved and instituted by a judgement of the King's Counsel on 19 January 1662: signed by Louis XIV, the letters patent allowed the service to run as a monopoly. After first trials from the 26 February, five routes were progressively started from the 18 March 1662, linking multiple Historical quarters of Paris. The new service was met with a positive reception by the general public upon its inauguration. Against the wishes of the King, the Parlement of Paris, barred soldiers, pages, and other liveried men from riding in the carriages \\"to assure the greater comfort and freedom of the bourgeois and meritous classes\\": these 'safety' measures, along with others such as a police ordinance that threatened \\"whipping and greater penalties\\" for those who interfered with proper operation on the service, and a fare increase from five to six sols, eventually caused public opinion to turn against the carrosses, causing the enterprise's profitability to decline.Jean Robert, Les tramways parisiens, p. 29 The precise fate of the carrosses √† cinq sols is not documented by any contemporary sources: certain historians suggest that the service disappeared only a few years after the parlement's restrictive measures entered effect. The franchise for the carrosses was recorded as having been transferred to the Sieur de Givry, although it does not confirm whether a service was actually running at the time. However, according to Marc Gaillard, the carrosses ran until 1677.  Description and Routes  The vehicles used for the service were pulled by four horses and were staffed by a coach driver and a valet. Each employee wore a blue jersey with the coat of arms of the king and of the city of Paris. The vehicles themselves, which carried eight passengers, only stopped on their routes when passengers requested to board or alight at stops. The first line ran from the Porte Saint-Antoine to Luxembourg Palace via the Pont au Change, the Pont Neuf, and Rue Dauphine. The second line, which linked Rue Saint Antoine and Rue Saint-Denis, began operation on 11 April. The third route, which linked Luxembourg Palace with Rue Montmartre via the Pont Saint-Michel, began operation on 2 May. The fourth route, beginning service on 24 June, contained two new innovations: a circular route and distance-based fares, which were implemented by dividing the circular route into six sections; riders paid five sols when they passed two sections. The fifth route, which connected Luxembourg Palace and Rue de Poitou, started operation on 5 July 1662.  Legacy  The carrosses √† cinq sols exhibited the characteristics of a modern public transit system. It had consistent routes, fixed schedules with regular departures (7¬Ω minutes on the first line), and fares that varied based on distance. The social hierarchy of France at the time and the tendency for residents to live close to where they worked, however, were factors that significantly reduced demand for the service. The demand for a public transport service would not become significant for another 150 years, when the omnibus, the first method of public transportation since the carrosses,Gaillard, Marc.

It was written by Bertolt Brecht and composed by Hanns Eisler. The best-known rendition was sung by Ernst Busch.  History  After Adolf Hitler's coming to power in January 1933, the situation for left-wing movements in Germany drastically deteriorated. The antagonism between the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party had long divided the German left. After the Nazis banned both parties and labour unions in the summer of 1933, many people, including Bertolt Brecht, realized that only a united front of social democrats and communists could fight back against fascism. In 1934, at the request of fellow theatre director Erwin Piscator, Brecht wrote the \\"Einheitsfrontlied\\", calling for all workers to join the Arbeiter-Einheitsfront, the Workers' United Front. The song was performed the next year in the First International Workers Music Olympiad held in Strasbourg by a choir of 3,000 workers. Its first record was printed in 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, performed by communist actor and singer Ernst Busch. It was later published in Brecht's 1939 collection Svendborger Gedichte.Bertolt Brecht, Poems 1913‚Äì1956, ed. by John Willett, Ralph Manheim, and Erich Fried (London: Eyre Methuen, 1976), p. 507.  Composition  Hanns Eisler, who would later go on to compose the East German national anthem \\"Auferstanden aus Ruinen\\", intentionally kept the composition of \\"Einheitsfrontlied\\" simple and easy to follow, so it could be sung by workers without much musical training. In doing so, the song is quite march-like. In 1948, Eisler wrote a symphonic version, which was also sung by Ernst Busch and recorded for his Aurora-Projekt.  Cover versions  Ton Steine Scherben covered the song on their 1971 album Warum geht es mir so dreckig?. Hannes Wader recorded the song on his 1977 album '.

It was initially set up in 1859 as a segregated school for schoolchildren of Chinese (and later Japanese and Korean) descent, part of the growing anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States that arose in the late 1800s. The school has been renamed a number of times, most recently in 1998 to the Gordon J. Lau Elementary School in honor of the city's first Chinese-American supervisor. History A small private school was briefly mentioned as having started in late 1852 in a letter to the editors of the Daily Alta California, warmly concluding \\"if the Chinese can be induced to settle permanently among us, that in time our country will be greatly benefitted by their accession.\\" A fundraising campaign was started six months later for a Chinese Mission to educate Chinese students in machinery and western religion. In September 1859 The Chinese School was opened as a segregated public school for Chinese students in San Francisco's Chinatown. \\"Negroes, Mongolians, and Indians\\" were legally barred from attending public schools by a state law passed in 1860 which allowed the establishment of segregated schools instead. Direct URL Attendance was sporadic and low for several years afterwards as many children did not attend school. One reason for low attendance rate may have been the lack of control the Chinese Americans had over school administration. Claiming a lack of funds, San Francisco Board of Education closed the school after only four months of operation, only to reopen it after the white community protested about integrating their schools. San Francisco segregated its Chinese school children from 1859 until 1871, when the city refused to fund any more classes for them. The California Political Code had been amended in 1866 to restrict enrollment in public schools to \\"all white children, between five and twenty- one years of age\\" (¬ß53), and required that \\"children of African or Mongolian descent, and Indian children not living under the care of white persons\\" be educated in segregated schools (¬ß57) which were to be separate but equal (¬ß59). Direct URL In 1870, the law was again rewritten to drop the requirement to provide any education for Chinese children, limiting the segregated separate but equal schools to \\"children of African descent, and Indian children.\\" Direct URL San Francisco Superintendent Denman cut funding from the Chinese School, which closed on March 1, 1871. After it closed, Chinese parents often sent their children to church schools or hired private teachers. Tape v. Hurley In 1880, the Political Code was modified to lift the restriction of enrollment to white students (¬ß1662) and the sections requiring separate but equal (¬ß1671) segregated schools (¬ß1669) were repealed. Direct URL With the change to the Code, in 1884, Joseph and Mary Tape challenged San Francisco's practice by enrolling their daughter, Mamie, in the all-white Spring Valley School. After the school refused to admit Mamie, the Tapes sued the school district in Tape v. Hurley and won. SFUSD appealed the lower court's decision to the California Supreme Court, where the justices sustained the verdict of the lower court. The case guaranteed the right of children born to Chinese parents to public education. Chinese Primary School, 916 Clay In the wake of Tape v. Hurley, Andrew Moulder, the Superintendent of Public Schools in San Francisco, sent a telegram to Representative W.B. May of the California State Assembly on March 4, 1885 urging passage of bills to reestablish segregated schools. \\"Without such action I have every reason to believe that some of our classes will be inundated by Mongolians. Trouble will follow.\\" May responded by pushing through Assembly Bill 268, which once again allowed the establishment of \\"separate schools for children of Mongolian or Chinese descent. When such separate schools are established, Chinese or Mongolian children must not be admitted into any other schools.\\"direct URL As a result, the San Francisco District decided to set up a separate Chinese Primary School the next year. Chinese Primary School had three classes with an enrollment of 90 students in 1895. The first location was at the corner of Jackson and Stone, but the school was later moved to 916 Clay. The Primary School was mentioned in an 1896 San Francisco Call article profiling the kindergarten at the First Chinese Baptist Church. The building at 916 Clay was destroyed in the April 1906 earthquake and subsequent fire, and a temporary building was erected at Joice and Clay to continue education. Oriental Public School W.A. Rogers cartoon for Harper's Weekly (10 Nov 1906), captioned \\"For Heaven's Sake Do Not Embarrass the Administration!\\" On October 11, 1906, amidst agitation for a Japanese exclusion law like the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, San Francisco Board of Education renamed the Chinese School the \\"Oriental Public School\\", and ordered the city's 93 Japanese school children to attend it along with students of Chinese and Korean ancestry. The Japanese government protested that this violated a treaty signed in 1894, which guaranteed the right of Japanese immigration to the United States. President Theodore Roosevelt invited Mayor Eugene Schmitz to Washington, D.C. to resolve the matter. The resulting Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 overturned the board of education's decision, overturned the segregation of Japanese-American school children, and excluded Japanese laborers from entering the United States. The building at the present site, designed by Albert Pissis, was completed in 1915 with an entrance on Washington, between Stockton and Powell. Local residents objected to the site, as it outside the traditional boundary of Chinatown, west of Stockton. The Oriental School was renamed Commodore Stockton School on April 1, 1924. Across Washington, the Commodore Stockton School Annex opened in 1924, designed by Angus McSweeney. The first Chinese teacher, named in 1927, was Alice Fong Yu, who initially assisted the principal with translation duties to interact with parents and students. Students were not permitted to speak Chinese in school or on the playground. Recent developments In 1998 Commodore Stockton Elementary School was renamed Gordon J. Lau Elementary School in honor of the first Chinese American elected to the Board of Supervisors, Gordon Lau. The San Francisco Unified School District finally repealed the regulation requiring students of Chinese and Korean heritage to attend the Oriental School in a largely symbolic gesture in 2017, more than a hundred years after the 1906 controversy.

Surrounding the bar, there is an inner ring that is defined by a sharp inner edge. Outside of the inner ring, there is a low surface brightness disk that contains weak spiral features. The disk in NGC 4608 is practically considered non-existent. One explanation is that the bar in the galaxy was able to form without a disk. Another explanation says that a weak bar forms initially. Over time, the bar grows by causing the external disk to lose angular momentum therefore funneling material toward the bulge. Then the bar would be surrounded by a halo with very little or no disk left.

It was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 17 resources, which included 13 contributing buildings, one contributing site, two contributing structures, and one contributing object. History Cedar Rapids was platted on the east bank of the Cedar River as Rapids City in 1841, and it was incorporated in 1849. The first burials in the town were in what was called the village cemetery. It was located at what is now Eighth Street and Fifth Avenue SE. Oak Hill Cemetery was established as Rose Hill, also known as Mount Washington, in 1853 on farmland outside of town that belonged to Gabriel Carpenter and Freeman Smith. The graves in the village cemetery were relocated here. They include some of the founders of Cedar Rapids. Chicago landscape architect Horace W.S. Cleveland was employed in 1869 and again in 1880 to prepare a plan for cemetery improvements giving it a rural picturesque landscape design. The Cedar Rapids architectural firm of Josselyn & Taylor designed the main entryway on the northwest corner of the cemetery in 1908 as a memorial to Lawson Daniels. It is composed of a gable-roofed shelter house, rustic stone walls and gateposts of cut glacial boulders, and decorative iron gates. Landscape architect, Ossian C. Simonds was hired in 1911 to redesign a portion of the cemetery's landscape. The buildings that contribute to the historic nature of the cemetery include the caretaker's house and garage, the barn, the gateway shelter house, and nine mausoleums. The contributing structures include the stone walls and gateposts. The contributing objects include gravestones and monuments that are counted as a single object. The designed landscape is the contributing site. Notable burials *Charles A.

The site was historically the location of a Haida village named Hlk'yah Llnagaay, meaning Peregrine Falcon Town in English. In the 1980s, Hlk'yah GÃ±awGÃ±a was the focus of a series of lawsuits and protests opposing clearcut logging on the island. These demonstrations were the impetus for the signing of the Gwaii Haanas Agreement of 1993 and the creation of the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, National Marine Conservation Area Reserve, and Haida Heritage Site. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Gwaii Haanas Agreement, the Legacy Pole was raised at Hlk'yah GÃ±awGÃ±a in the summer of 2013. The pole was carved by Jaalen Edenshaw, of the Ts'aahl Clan.  History  Hlk'yah GÃ±awGÃ±a was once the site of Hlk'yah Llnagaay, a Haida village and later a seasonal site for summer activities. The large and plentiful cedar trees surrounding the village provided the Haida who lived there with many medicinal, cultural, and utilitarian materials. Today, many of these culturally modified trees can be seen at Hlk'yah GÃ±awGÃ±a. The village was situated on a river, which provided fish and water fowl for sustenance and remains culturally significant to the Haida today. In 1987, a longhouse named Looking Around and Blinking House was built at Hlk'yah GÃ±awGÃ±a. Designed by Haida carver and activist Guujaaw and painted by Haida artist Robert Davidson, the longhouse provided a gathering place for Haida protesters who were forming road blockades in an attempt to stop logging on the island.  Logging protests  In 1974, logging company ITT-Rayonier delivered a project proposal to the Ministry of Forests which included a 5-year logging plan in the southern archipelago of Haida Gwaii. The proposal was met with swift opposition by the Haida, initiated in large part by Guujaaw, and non-Haida living on Haida Gwaii. The logging proposal, which was originally set for parts of the South Moresby Area including Burnaby Island, was stopped and the government of British Columbia offered the use of Ahtlii Gwaii instead. Over the next several years, the Haida created several petitions, committees, and partnerships in an attempt to stop the logging on Athlii Gwaii. In 1985, after repeated attempts to stop logging proved unsuccessful, the Council of the Haida Nation decided to take direct action by forming a blockade on Athlii Gwaii. The blockades and protests continued for over a year, and resulted in the arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of 72 Haida.  Media and protest attention  The campaign to protect Lyell Island from logging received international media attention with the support of individuals like David Suzuki and his show The Nature of Things, that featured Hlk'yah GÃ±awGÃ±a on national television in January 1982. In 1986, a cross- country media campaign began in which the South Moresby Caravan travelled from St. John's Newfoundland to Vancouver, with public stops, concerts, and fundraising events along the way. During the protests, the Loo Taas, a canoe carved by Haida artist and carver Bill Reid of the Kaadaas gaah Kiiguwaay clan was paddled 600 miles from Vancouver to Skidegate. The journey garnered national media attention on not only the journey itself but also the blockades on Athlii Gwaii.  Aftermath  As a result of pressure stemming from the media's coverage of the logging protests on Athlii Gwaii, Canada and the Province of British Columbia‚Äôs governments entered into negotiations with the Council of the Haida Nation in 1987. In 1988, the South Moresby Agreement was signed, designating Gwaii Haanas as a national park reserve. In 1993, the Gwaii Haanas Agreement was signed by the Council of the Haida Nation and the Government of Canada. This agreement acknowledged the two governments' differing viewpoints regarding ownership of the lands constituting Gwaii Haanas, yet found common ground in the desire of both parties to protect and care for it. As a result, the two governments agreed to co-manage the land of the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site, and committed to creating a marine agreement in the future. In 2009, the Kunst‚Äôaa Guu‚ÄìKunst‚Äôaayah Reconciliation Protocol was formed, which outlined Haida and Crown land titles, and in 2010 the Gwaii Haanas Marine Agreement was ratified to protect the marine ecosystem of southern Haida Gwaii. Of those who were arrested during the blockades, 10 were convicted of mischief according to Section 387 of the Canadian Criminal Code. However, none served any jail time.  Legacy pole  In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Gwaii Haanas Agreement, the Gwaii Haanas Legacy Pole, carved by Jaalen Edenshaw of the Ts'aahl Clan, was raised at Hlk'yah GÃ±awGÃ±a on August 15, 2013. Over 400 people participated in the ceremony, and another 400 bore witness via livestream from Skidegate. It was the first raising of a monumental Haida pole in Gwaii Haanas in over 130 years. The symbols represented in the Legacy Pole highlight different elements of the Gwaii Haanas agreement. Following from the base to the top, the symbols are as follows: * Grizzly bear and sculpin: the grizzly bear honours oral histories and archeological evidence of their presence on Haida Gwaii, and the sculpin represents the sea. * \\"5 Good People Standing Together\\": these honour those who protected Athlii Gwaii against logging and those who worked to protect Gwaii Haanas as a whole. * Raven: one of the two Haida moieties. Eagle, the second moiety, appears at the top of the pole. * Sacred One Standing and Moving: the Supernatural being who holds up Haida Gwaii, and he causes earthquakes when he moves. * Wasco: a Supernatural sea-wolf. * Dog, marten, and visitor: the dog is an allusion to a recent archeological find of domesticated dog bones dating back over 14,000 years, evidence that human beings have lived in Haida Gwaii for as long. The marten runs up the pole and creates the sound that comes before a large earthquake, and the visitor represents those who come to visit Gwaii Haanas. * Three watchmen: Traditionally, these figures were carved to protect against attacks by watching and down the coast and out to sea. In 1985, the title was used by groups of Haida travelling to old village sites to protect them from logging. Today, the symbol was adopted by the Haida Gwaii Watchmen Program, a Haida-led group of guardians who spend their summers on the village sites of Gwaii Haanas to ensure that visitors leave no traces of their passing. * Eagle: the second of the two Haida moieties, the Eagle symbolizes the sky. The presence of the Eagle at the top of the pole and the sculpin at its bottom represent the fact that Gwaii Haanas is protected from the ocean floor to the mountaintops.

It is Broadrick's third release under the JK Flesh title, following the debut studio album, Posthuman (2012), and a split album with Prurient, Worship Is the Cleansing of the Imagination (2012). Content Unlike Posthuman, Nothing Is Free adopts a sparser, more sterile drum and bass sound. Most of the traditional metal riffs are gone and replaced with abrasive washes of bass and other synthesizer noises, which Broadrick saw as a more honest realization of what he set out to do with the JK Flesh project. The EP has been noted for its high level of aural aggression as well as ability to be both disturbing and danceable. The tracks on the album are slower and more darkly psychedelic than those on Posthuman, with Broadrick commenting \\"I love working in that slowish, 80 to 90 BPM, super fucking gray area. A lot of DJs don‚Äôt want to play that stuff, but for me, it‚Äôs a great zone to experiment.\\" Greg Kennelty of Metal Injection wrote, \\"The album is a compilation of works Broadrick did between 2013 and 2015, though I wouldn't call these b-sides or anything. They sound like fully-formed, well- produced songs that belong on pretty much any of his projects.\\" Despite being categorized as an EP, Nothing Is Free clocks in at 55:05, which is longer than many traditional studio albums, including JK Flesh's 2016 follow-up release Rise Above. Reception Crack Magazine's Billy Black described the EP as \\"relentless industrial nightmare that proves, if nothing else, that Broadrick is a master of all things unholy,\\" while Klaus Kinski from BrooklynVegan called it \\"wall to wall sonic brilliance\\". Writing for Intravenous Magazine, Sean Palfrey summed up Nothing Is Free saying it \\"blends elements of dub, industrial and noise into a heady and oppressive mix of throbbing beats, swirling synths, static, distorted vocals, and subtle melodies that is cerebral in its execution\\" and \\"a rewarding listen\\". Allen Griffin from Burning Ambulance said Broadrick \\"displays a keen awareness of beat culture\\" and praised his sonic palette. Freq agreed calling the EP \\"supremely confident and knowledgable (sic)\\", also adding that \\"Nothing Is Free almost palpably swelters, demands motion, forces the body to change its way of being, to take a chance on total immersion in skilfully structured, blissfully overwhelming noise\\".

He is the author of Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America, which won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, and a co-founder of the Maya Angelou School in Washington, D.C.  Early life  Forman is the son of James Forman Sr. and Constancia Romilly, who met through their activism and involvement with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC. Forman Sr. was the group's executive secretary handling internal operations from 1961 to 1966 and active during the 1964 Freedom Summer. Romilly, daughter of the British journalist and aristocrat Jessica Mitford, dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College to join the group in 1962 and would eventually become a coordinator of SNCC's Atlanta chapter. Forman has a brother, Chaka Forman. Forman Sr. and Romilly divorced in the early 1970s when Forman was seven years old. Forman speculated in an interview that FBI pressure on civil rights groups at the time contributed to the strain on his parents' marriage: \\"There was also the period when...the FBI was putting incredible pressure on civil rights groups through the counter-intelligence program -- or the COINTELPRO program. And they were fomenting lies and distrust... They [Forman Sr. and Romilly] had a hard time in those years for a lot of reasons but I know, for my mom in particular, that that was one.\\" After his parents' divorce, Forman and his brother lived with Romilly in New York but spent summers and holidays with Forman Sr., and Forman has stated that both parents were active in his life. Forman was accepted into an elite New York high school: Hunter College High School. The school was almost all white, prompting Romilly to move with her sons to Atlanta so they could grow up in a black community, which she considered important for their racial identities. Forman expressed the importance of this move in an interview, saying: \\"In a city that has so many African-American people, I would go to school, and the jocks were black. The nerds were black... The artsy kids were black. The band-camp kids were black. The thugs were black -- like, everybody was black. So there wasn't a way to perform that went along with being black. And that, I think, was very powerful and liberating for me as a child because it meant I got to be who I was, which was a nerdy kid. And nobody thought, oh, well, you're not black if you're reading books.\\" Forman attended Roosevelt High School in Atlanta. He went on to attend Brown University, from which he received his Bachelor of Arts in 1988. He received a Doctor of Law degree from Yale Law School in 1992.  Law career   Law Clerk  In the 1990s, right after graduating law school, Forman began work as a law clerk for William Norris of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The next year he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Forman describes working with O'Connor as enjoyable, although they disagreed on many of the social issues that came before the court. In his interview for the job, Forman was asked how his differing political viewpoints would affect his work as a law clerk. In an interview, he stated his response: \\"I told her that I will argue with you. I'll tell you the truth about what I think. I will try to persuade you. But at the end of the day, you are the justice, and I'm the law clerk. And if I'm taking this job, I'm agreeing to help you do your work, right? I'm helping -- if you decide to come out the other way and assign me the opinion, then I'll write the best opinion I can for you.\\"  Public Defender  During his stint as her law clerk, Forman was encouraged by O'Connor to pursue a career in the Department of Justice or with a civil rights organization such as the NAACP. He instead opted to become a public defender, saying in an interview, \\"I imagined myself doing the civil rights work of my generation.\\" Forman became a public defender in Washington, D.C. in the fall of 1994, a job he would hold for six years. He wrote about some of his experiences with clients in Locking Up Our Own.  Teaching  In 2003, Forman began teaching law at Georgetown University. He remained at Georgetown until 2011, when he joined the faculty at Yale. There he teaches Constitutional Law and seminars entitled Race, Class and Punishment and another entitled Inside Out: Issues in Criminal Justice.  The Maya Angelou School  In 1997, Forman cofounded with David Domenici as part of the See Forever Foundation, a comprehensive educational program for teens, which later became the Maya Angelou Public Charter School. Domenici, a Stanford Law graduate and former corporate attorney first pitched his idea for the school to Forman in a D.C. coffee shop in 1995, and they began planning in earnest soon after. The school was designed to reach troubled children and provide them high-quality education, counseling services, and employment opportunities. Forman thought the program could be incredibly beneficial to some of his clients as a public defender; he wrote in his book: \\"Most of my clients had struggled in school or dropped out altogether before they were arrested. If a program like [this one] had existed‚Ä¶they might never have become my clients in the first place.\\" In 1997, Forman took a leave of absence from public defense work to pursue opening the Maya Angelou School. In the fall, with some grant money and teachers hired on, the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School opened with twenty students selected from the court system, all of them either on probation or committed to the Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Services. The students had poor academic records and had often experienced trauma or struggled with mental health. In addition, Forman writes in Locking Up Our Own about ongoing struggles with local police targeting students of the school for searches and arrests. Despite these difficulties, the school was successful. By September 2004, the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School had grown significantly and opened a second campus location in partnership with the District of Columbia Public Schools. In the summer of 2007, the Maya Angelou School took over the school inside Oak Hill Detention Center, Washington D.C.'s juvenile prison. The changes enacted by the Maya Angelou School inside the prison were described by a court monitor as contributing to an \\"extraordinary\\" turnaround. The same year, the Transition Center was also opened to help young people transition from incarceration by helping them get GEDs and workplace credentials. Today the Maya Angelou School system includes the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School, the Maya Angelou Young Adult Learning Center (the Transition Center), and the Maya Angelou Academy at New Beginnings. The Maya Angelou School's mission statement, described as \\"the Maya Way\\" on the school's website, is to provide \\"a comprehensive approach to education that focuses on academic achievement, social and emotional support, and career and college preparation so students are ready for life after Maya.\\" The school's name was chosen in a contest from an essay written by Sherti Hendrix, a member of the class of 1999, the school's first graduating class. Bibliography Forman was part of the 1999 documentary Innocent Until Proven Guilty, which focused on his work as a public defender and with the See Forever Foundation. Forman has contributed writing about topics such as police brutality, mass incarceration, and the criminal justice system to The Atlantic and The New York Times. In April 2017, Forman published his first book, Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America. The book examines tough on crime policies that were supported in many black communities in the 1970s but are now contributing to mass incarceration. In an interview, Forman stated about the issues addressed in the book: \\"When we think about our criminal justice system, I don't think we can imagine choices in isolation... And so what I'm trying to argue in the book is that we have to look at this system as a whole, and we have to look at all of its dysfunctions. And only until we do that will we really understand the damage that it's doing to people's lives. Sometimes, some people even say we need more prisons. But they also say, we need more job training. We need more housing. We need better schools. We need funding for drug treatment, for mental health treatment. We need a national gun control policy. We need a Marshall Plan for urban America. We need the federal government to do for black communities what it did for Europe after World War II -- to rebuild, to reinvest, to revitalize. That's the claim. But instead of all of the above, the black community, historically, has gotten one of the above. And the one of the above is law enforcement.\\" Locking Up Our Own was included on accolade lists such as the Publishers Weekly Best Books of 2017, the New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice, the GQ Book of the Year as well was the longlist for the National Book Awards and the shortlist for the Inaugural Goddard Riverside Stephan Russo Book Prize for Social Justice.

He owned and ran the family cotton spinning and weaving factory in Rouen, one of the most important in the region. For many years he was mayor of Rouen. He was responsible for building two bridges over the Seine, and for a policy of putting the indigent and insane to work in charitable workshops. He was a deputy for the Seine during the July Monarchy and again during the Second French Empire. Family Henri Barbet was born on 23 June 1789 in D√©ville-l√®s-Rouen, Seine-Inf√©rieure. He was from a Protestant family from the canton of Bolbec. His parents were Jacques Juste Barbet (1756‚Äì1813), merchant, and Marie Marguerite Gosgibus (1749‚Äì1834). He had an older brother, Juste Barbet de Jouy (1785‚Äì1866) and a younger brother Louis Auguste Barbet (1791‚Äì1872). In 1810 he married Marguerite Angran (1789‚Äì1858). They had two sons, Zo√© Barbet (1810‚Äì72) and Henri Barbet (1816‚Äì1904), and two daughters, Aglaure Barbet (1814‚Äì89) and Th√©r√®se Barbet (1824‚Äì99). Business career The Barbets owned a factory in Rouen that spun Indian cotton and wove \\"indienne\\" cloth. It was one of the most important in the Seine-Inf√©rieure, a center of cloth manufacture, and was awarded silver medals in 1819, 1823 and 1827. After their oldest brother left Rouen, Henri and his brother Auguste managed the Rouen factories under the name of \\"Barbet Fr√®res\\". Later the \\"Barbet Fr√®res\\" partnership was dissolved and Henri became sole owner of the family factory, which he expanded considerably. He and his brother-in-law Prosper Angran formed the company \\"Henry Barbet & Cie\\". He became a great industrialist. He was a member of the Rouen Commercial Court and the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Rouen. He entered the Rouen Chamber of Commerce in 1828, and was President until 1872. In 1831 and 1833 King Louis Philippe visited the Fr√®res Barbet factories in D√©ville-l√®s-Rouen. Later Napoleon III would visit the factories. In 1842 Barbet acquired the large estate of Valmont in the valley of F√©camp, including parts of the communes of Mont-Saint-Aignan, Canteleu, Maromme, Notre-Dame-de-Bondeville and Sologne. He converted to Catholicism, and he and his wife donated two stained glass windows to the Basilique Notre-Dame de Bonsecours. The Association pour la d√©fense du Travail national was formed to oppose the lowering of tariffs. In 1845 it was joined by the committee of metallurgists. The council included Antoine Odier (President), Auguste Mimerel (Vice-President), Joseph P√©rier (Treasurer) and Louis-Martin Lebeuf (Secretary). Members included Henri Barbet, L√©on Talabot and Eug√®ne Schneider. Barbet became an administrator of the Chemins de Fer du Nord. In 1858 Barbet handed over management of his factory to his son. Local politics Henri Barbet was a militant Orl√©anist during the July Revolution of 1830. During the July Monarchy (1830‚Äì48) Barbet was made a member of the General Council of the Seine Inf√©rieure in 1830. He was mayor of Rouen from 1830 to 1847. He was made a knight of the Legion of Honour in 1831. In 1836 he was elected president of the General Council. He was made a commander of the Legion of Honour in 1844. As mayor of Rouen Barbet was responsible for opening the Pont d'Orl√©ans (now the Corneille bridge), which connects the two banks of the Seine. This had been discussed since the 16th century. He was also responsible for the Bo√Øeldieu suspension bridge. Barbet's social policy, called by some contemporaries the \\"Barbet System\\", was to make the poor do useful work. His main target was the \\"lazy\\" or \\"bad\\" poor, who made begging their main way of life, but he also thought that the insane could do useful work. He promoted eliminating indigence in Rouen by creating charitable workshops. In 1844 he was made chairman of the supervisory board of the Saint- Yon Asylum for the Insane of Rouen. National politics Barbet was elected a Deputy for 1st constituency (Rouen) of Seine-Inf√©rieure on 5 July 1831 for the government majority. In the first session he voted against heredity of the peerage. He was reelected on 21 July 1834, 4 November 1837 and 2 March 1839, holding office until 12 June 1842. He was not reelected in 1842. On 25 June 1844 he was reelected in a by-election, replacing Jacques Laffitte, who had died. He was again elected Deputy for Seine-Inf√©rieure for the government majority on 25 June 1844, holding office until 6 July 1846. He was created a peer of France on 21 July 1846. During the Second French Empire Henri Barbet was elected to the Corps l√©gislatif for the dynastic majority group, holding office from 31 May 1863 to 27 April 1869.

The library was constructed in 1908 with funds from industrialist Andrew Carnegie and is currently part of the Marmot Library System.  History  In 1894, the Tuesday Evening Club, a spirited group of Salida townswomen, made the decision that the town of Salida needed a library. The club sponsored lectures and held Chautauquas, put on musical entertainments, and held fundraisers and receptions. They purchased books at second-hand bookstores and opened library rooms at various places in Salida. The Tuesday Evening Club official incorporated the Salida Library Association in 1902. In 1905, the Club wrote a letter to Andrew Carnegie requesting additional funding to build a library. He agreed and donated $9,000 with the stipulation that the Club find a suitable site for the building. The Club, along with the town, raised an additional $6,000 and the culmination of their efforts resulted in the opening of the Salida Public Library in 1908.  Services  As a member of the Marmot Library System, the Salida Regional Library offers access to the library's catalog and to other member libraries. The library offers online subscription databases for research. Library programs include Children's Storytime, Book Clubs, and Summer Reading. The library also offers a digital archive filled with images from Salida's past.

Dadens was once a popular trading post for the North Pacific fur trade among European traders in the late 18th century, due to its size and accessibility. Dadens no longer continues to be used by families year round, but it was used as a fishing village during the summer months by many Haida up until the 1950s and 1960s, and is still used to a limited extent today. There have been multiple migrations of families from Dadens to South East Alaska and these people are now known as the Kiagani Haida.  People A house in Dadens in 1878 Haida families broadly belong to one of two matrilineal moieties or clans; those being the Eagle and the Raven clans, however, each family group has their own unique lineages and sub lineages represented by symbols or crests. This is the practice Haida have followed in the past however it does not necessarily mean all Haida follow this practice today. According to George F. MacDonald in Haida Monumental Art, at the first point of European contact, Dadens was owned by the Middle Town People, the Yahgu Laanaas Raven Clan.  European relations & fur trade  Initial contact The first recorded mention of Dadens was in 1774, though not by name, by the explorer Juan Perez, who sailed past it. And it was not until 1789 that there was a recorded landing, achieved by Captain William Douglas. When Douglas arrived he did not have much success in trading, due to the poor quality iron his ship was carrying. From the accounts at this time, it was still a fairly large village, with a number of people inhabiting it. John Bartlett arrived at the village in 1791, and left with the first, possibly only surviving sketch of a house and frontal pole from Dadens, though John Meares had taken note of a pole during his voyage in 1789. Joseph Ingraham landed in Dadens in the same year, and described the village and its poles in his journal. He met three chiefs there, and identified two of them as gu.uu (whom he referred to as Cow), and Goi, but did not record a name for the last. His journal was the first to describe two large poles, not just one, both around four storeys. However, it is unclear what the second one was representative of. He also described a house with \\"an excavated interior\\" and support planks. Almost immediately afterward the first French vessel arrived, captained by Etienne Marchand. An officer on his boat reportedly saw a group of people in canoes go ashore, so the ship quickly followed suit. At this time there were only two houses left in the village, but they were still occupied by a large number of people. Eight years later Captain James Rowan on his ship Eliza arrived. He traded a hostage with the people of Dadens, to ensure peace was kept between the two groups. The ship clerk Samuel Berling (or John Burling, in some literature), copied what 'Mr. Bumstead,' who was sent on land as the hostage, described. There were still only two houses standing at this time, but he also claimed there was a surprisingly large number of people living in them, many of whom he identifies as female slaves. Here he met Yaahl Daajee, the chief, which Berling transcribed as 'Altatse,' and is written as Eldarge in at least one source. According to this journal the two houses belonged to this chief and his brother, who is not named.  Emigration to southern shores of Alaska  There have been multiple migrations of families from Dadens to south east Alaska in Haida history. Ethnographers and anthropologists have speculated that some of these family groups emigrated to Alaska post-European contact. Further, Florence Davidson in During My Time recalls gatherings at Dadens in the 1900s.  Kaigani  The Haida who moved to Alaska became known as the Alaskan Haida, √ë'√≠is √ùaat'√°ay, or colloquially as the Kaigani Haida. The Tlingit Peoples also live in Alaska. Today, these two distinct nations have banded together for political reasons, namely due to the colonization of their ancestral lands by the British and Canadian Governments and their mutual pursuit of Land Entitlement and sovereign nationhood. The organize under the Central Council Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska. The Council of the Haida Nation (CHN) is the Indigenous governance on Haida Gwaii.  21st century  While Dadens is currently uninhabited, it has not been abandoned by the Haida. There continue to be hereditary chiefs of the village, a title passed down from one member of a clan to another, through the matrilineal line, who do not live in the village, but are tasked with protecting it. The current hereditary chief is Darin Swanson, whose Haida name is Ginaawaan, and who is a potlatched Chief and member of the Hereditary Chiefs Council, which is another governing body in addition to the CHN. Another notable chief was Claude Davidson (1924-1991), son of Florence Davidson, an artist and father to Robert Davidson and Reg Davidson, both of whom are also artists. He was chief from 1986 until his death. The village is now protected by a Watchman, and to visit, as with all historic villages in Haida Gwaii, one must first obtain a permit.

She was one of the founders of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party's Pro-Independence Movement (MPI) and a prominent member of the Central Committee of the party. After being asked to teach a course on Puerto Rican history and discovering there were no textbooks for students to study, she wrote a three volume history of the island, which is considered her most important work. She also wrote several texts questioning the methodology historians used to develop social histories of Caribbean nations. She was awarded the National Cultural Medal by the Cuban Ministry of Culture in 1996. Early life Loida Figueroa Mercado was born on October 6, 1917 in Yauco, Puerto Rico to Emetria Mercado and Agust√≠n Figueroa. Her father was a sugarcane cutter and coffee worker. Her mother served as a domestic and though neither had a formal education, they both urged their children to attend school and were knowledgeable about the island's history. She was raised in a household composed of a half-brother, Juan Arroyo Mercado; three sisters Priscilla, Rachel and Elsie; and a foster sister, Sonia V√©lez. Figueroa completed her primary schooling at the Yauco Elementary School, completing eighth grade in 1931. Because her father became ill and was unable to work, she left school at that time and began working as a needleworker. After two years, she returned to her education, entering the Escuela Superior de Yauco (High School of Yauco), intent on becoming a nurse. Graduating as the class Salutatorian in 1936, she entered the Instituto Polit√©cnico de San Germ√°n and later that same year, on December 31, 1936 she married Julio Cesar Flores. The couple decided that her schooling should take priority, and Figueroa took up residence in the female dormitory. She had to work to put herself through school, holding a variety of jobs at the school including babysitting the teacher's children; working in the kitchen and dining room; tutoring; and assisting with the institution's poultry farm. When she became pregnant with her first daughter, Eunice Flores Figueroa, the school forced her to leave, but she returned the following semester, graduating magna cum laude with her class in 1941. Career Figueroa began teaching in 1942, as an elementary school teacher in Fajardo of English and French languages, as well as Puerto Rican and United States history. She shifted to high school, working in Gu√°nica between 1942 and 1957. In 1947 and again in 1955, she served as acting school principal. Her first marriage ended in divorce and on December 25, 1944, she married Ismael Olivieri. The couple subsequently had two daughters, Antonia and Rebeca Olivieri Figueroa. In 1947, she published her first book of poetry Acridulces, which was described by critics as neo- Romantic, but which placed her within the first generation of academic and professional Puerto Ricans known as the Generation of the 50s. The groups' works tend to focus on the rapid urbanization going on in Puerto Rico during the 1950s and the concern that cultural heritage was being supplanted by Americanization. After her divorce from Olivieri, Figueroa married Jos√© Nelson Castro Vega, with whom she had her last daughter, Avaris Castro Figueroa. The couple would also divorce. While still working as a teacher, she earned a master's degree from Columbia University in New York City, in the Faculty of Political Sciences in 1952. Her dissertation was titled The Development of Political Consciousness in Puerto Rico during the 19th Century. In 1957, she began teaching at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez Campus and while living in Mayag√ºez became one of the founders of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party (PSP)'s Pro-Independence Movement (MPI) in 1959. Joining the central committee of the PSP, she became very active in the movement to gain independence from the United States. As an Afro-Puerto Rican woman, a radical socialist, and nationalist, she openly criticized the government, leading to police surveillance. Figueroa's second book, Arenales, was published in 1961. A novel, the book evaluates the social problems, such as colonialism, gender violence and machismo, labor exploitation, poverty and racism, which existed in Central Gu√°nica, Puerto Rico's largest sugar factory and an iconic symbol of American imperialism. In 1963, Figueroa graduated with her PhD in history from the Central University of Madrid with her thesis Puerto Rico ante la oferta de las Leyes Especiales por Espa√±a (Puerto Rico before the application of the Special Laws of Spain). Figueroa published her Breve historia de Puerto Rico: Desde sus comienzos hasta 1800 (Brief History of Puerto Rico: From its beginnings to 1800) in two volumes. The first was published 1968 and the second in 1969, after being asked to teach a course on Puerto Rican history and finding that there were no textbooks for students to study. In 1971, she moved to New York and taught as a visiting scholar at Lehman College and the City College, both within the City University of New York system. In 1972 Figueroa published, in English, the History of Puerto Rico from the Beginning to 1892, which incorporated both Spanish volumes into one book. That same year, Tres puntos claves: Lares, idioma, soberan√≠a (Three Key Points: Homes, language, sovereignty), which discussed Puerto Rican nationalism, was published. In 1974, she retired from the University of Puerto Rico and moved to New York City. She was hired to teach the Puerto Rican Studies program at Brooklyn College, which had been founded in 1971, but a change in the administration around the time of her arrival imposed restrictions about course materials that she opposed. In 1975, she published Historiograf√≠a de Puerto Rico (Historiography of Puerto Rico), which challenged the accepted methods used by historians to evaluate the linguistic and social history of the island. Figueroa joined students in protesting the curtailment of autonomy for the program and after a two-year battle, they won their fight. In 1977, Figueroa published the third volume in the series Breve Historia, Breve historia de Puerto Rico: Desde el crep√∫sculo del dominio espa√±ol hasta la antesala de la Ley Foraker, c. 1892‚Äì1900 (Brief history of Puerto Rico: From the twilight of Spanish rule to the forerunner of the Foraker Law, c. 1892‚Äì1900), which evaluated the invasion of the island by Europeans and later, the Americans. The volumes are her most important work, giving a history of the island, incorporating her doctoral research. The first two volumes cover the period up to the American intervention in the 1890s on the island and the last volume discusses the turbulent period when Spain and the United States were struggling for control. She continued teaching at Brooklyn until her retirement in 1977. In 1979, Figueroa published El caso de Puerto Rico a nivel internacional (The Case of Puerto Rico at the International Level), which analyzed the liberation movement beginning in 1948 and the response of the United Nations. In 1980, Figueroa, who had returned to Puerto Rico, ran as a mayoral candidate for the city of Mayag√ºez. She continued publishing, with works such as El papel hist√≥rico y social de la mujer en el Caribe Hisp√°nico (The Historical and Social Role of Women in the Hispanic Caribbean, 1982) and coauthored Hostos (Hosts), a series of essays with Cuban writer Emilio God√≠nez Sosa in 1987 and Aspectos de la cuesti√≥n nacional en Puerto Rico (Aspects of the nationalism question in Puerto Rico) with James Morris Blaut of the University of Chicago in 1988. After her retirement, Figueroa traveled widely promoting Puerto Rican independence. At the time of her death, she was working on a forth volume of Breve Historia covering the period from 1900 to 1921 in Puerto Rico's history. She was awarded the National Cultural Medal by the Cuban Ministry of Culture for her historiographical work on the relationship between the two Antillean nations in 1996, shortly before her death. Death and legacy Figueroa died on December 14, 1996 in R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico and was buried in Los Cipreses Memorial Park, in Bayam√≥n. Her papers are housed at the University of Puerto Rico, R√≠o Piedras Campus and she is widely remembered in Puerto Rico. In 2017, celebrations occurred throughout the island for the centenary of her birth.

It is Broadrick's fourth release under the JK Flesh title and continues the sparse, drum and bass style of Nothing Is Free, the EP released a year earlier. Composition Inspired by Broadrick's childhood in industrial Birmingham, Rise Above's sound is characterized by heavy distortion, kinetic beats, and noisy production. In keeping with the JK Flesh evolution, nearly all elements of industrial metal are gone from this album and replaced with starker, more synthetic sounds. John Twells of Fact wrote, \\"The doomy, distorted grind of Godflesh and Jesu is certainly still present, but woven into a wheezing 4/4 template that doesn‚Äôt sound a million miles from Andy Stott‚Äôs patented 'knackered house' or a Surgeon record on the wrong speed being played through a broken car stereo.\\" Chang Terhune of Igloo Magazine also drew comparisons between Rise Above and the work of Andy Stott. Heathen Harvest likened the album's percussion driven approach to early industrial albums: \\"The predominant sound is that of the factory: machines, machines, and more machines.\\" According to Broadrick, his vision for JK Flesh was only fully realized with Rise Above. About the deliberate shift away from guitar and industrial beats, he said, \\"Wildly divisive, its lack of guitars and its adherence to 4/4 techno, has led to a misunderstanding of this project's intentions, but I find this is positive.

They are given out annually at Dragon Con in Atlanta, Georgia. The finalist shortlist for the first Dragon Awards was announced on August 11, 2016, and the winners were announced on September 4 that year. A unique feature of the Awards is that it runs a diverse set of subgenera. In 2017, nominated authors Allison Littlewood, John Scalzi, and N.K. Jemisin asked Dragon Con to remove their names from the ballot. John Scalzi then reconsidered and kept his name on the ballot. The coordinators of the Dragon Awards initially refused to remove authors names, then changed their minds after receiving criticism across blogs and science fiction related publications. Nomination and voting processes The nominations and votes are collected electronically. Participation is available to everyone, requiring only an e-mail address, but no membership or other fees, to vote. The Dragon Awards website states that they \\"[reserve] the right to invalidate suspect or questionable ballots without notice,\\" and that \\"All decisions regarding the voting process and selection of winners shall be made by DRAGON CON in its sole discretion, shall be final, and shall not be subject to challenge or appeal.\\" Language describing the review of nominations does not state that nominations are counted numerically but are \\"gathered and reviewed to create a final ballot.\\" Neither counts of nominations nor votes have ever been made public.

Takahashi serves as a project research leader at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe focusing on the clinical application of iPS Cell (induced Pluripotent Stem Cell) technology on macular degeneration. In 2014 Takahashi was named by British science journal Nature as one of \\"five to watch\\" global scientists for her groundbreaking work in regenerative medicine. In March 2017 a team led by Takahashi completed the first successful transplant of iPS-derived retinal cells into the eye of a patient suffering from advanced wet age-related macular degeneration. During the surgery the patient received a transplant of approximately 250,000 retinal pigment epithelial cells into the eye generated from donor-derived iPSCs. Results of this landmark study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Education  Takahashi was born in Osaka Japan in 1961. After graduating from the Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto University in 1986 and obtaining a PhD specializing in visual pathology at the same university in 1992, Takahashi's clinical and research work has focused on ophthalmology and retinal diseases. She chose ophthalmology as her specialty because she wanted to have a family and thought the discipline would help her best balance work and life. In 1995 Takahashi commenced post-doctoral research at the Salk Institute's Laboratory of Genetics. There she was fascinated by the chances of using stem cells for eye diseases and retinal therapy. Since 2001 she has served as an associate professor at the translational research center. Research In September 2014, her and her team at the Riken Institute‚Äôs center for developmental biology in Kobe succeeded in a world-first transplanting of cells made from induced pluripotent stem cells into a human body. The operation was conducted as a clinical study and involved creating a retinal sheet from iPS cells, which were developed by Shinya Yamanaka. iPS cells are created by removing mature cells from an individual and reprogramming these cells back to an embryonic state. The retinal sheet was transplanted into a female patient in her 70s with age related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye complication that blurs the central field of vision and can progress into blindness. The iPS cells were hoped to stop the progression of AMD. Her and her research team used iPS cells made from the patient‚Äôs own skin cells. Then in March she and her team carried out the world‚Äôs first transplant of retinal cells created from donor iPS cells. Time and cost used in the surgery has been significantly reduced by using super donor cells, cells derived from people with special white blood cell types that aren‚Äôt rejected by the immune systems of receiving patients. Awards and honors In 2015 Takahashi was awarded the Ogawa- Yamanaka Prize in Stem Cell Biology. Nature Magazine named her as one of five ‚Äúscientists to watch in 2014‚Äù and nominated her as one of ten ‚Äúpeople who mattered in 2014‚Äù. Further Prospects Many challenges remain however to advance the technology and make it commercially available. One of the issues is the high cost and it is estimated that could take until around 2019 before the cost of the IPS treatment for AMD will is below ¬•10 million ($95,500) The procedure is expected to set the path for more applications of IPS-cell technology, which offers the versatility of embryonic cells without their ethical talent. The future of IPSC therapy looks promising and regenerative medicine will likely become a big field in the future. IPSCs and ESCs have the potential to industrialize the cell therapy field because they can be expanded so that more cells can be made for many patients. Also photoreceptor transplantation along with IPS derived cells is to be expected within five years which should not only slow AMD but could possibly even restore some vision. In addition, the effect of regenerative medicine will not depend on the donors cells but depend on the host condition and the surgery skill.

The use of terms and images referring to Native Americans/First Nations as the name or mascot for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the United States and Canada. Since the 1960s, as part of the indigenous civil rights movements, there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters targeting the more prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB) (in particular their now- discontinued \\"Chief Wahoo\\" logo); the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) (the term \\"redskins\\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as 'derogatory slang'); and, at a smaller level, the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs and MLB's Atlanta Braves, due to \\"the tomahawk chop\\" often performed by their fans. While not receiving the same level of public attention, the Blackhawks are considered part of the larger issue. The issue is often discussed in the media in terms of offensiveness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. Stereotyping may directly affect the academic performance and self-esteem of Native American youth, whose people face high rates of suicide, unemployment, and poverty. Euro-Americans exposed to mascots may be more likely to believe not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research demonstrates the harm of stereotyping, with studies showing that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other groups. In 2005, the American Psychological Association issued a resolution \\"Recommending the Immediate Retirement of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations\\" due to the harm done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self- esteem of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of Native Americans. Similar resolutions have been adopted by the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport, the American Sociological Association, the American Counseling Association, and the American Anthropological Association. In a 2005 report on the status of Native American students, the National Education Association included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one of its recommendations. The National Congress of American Indians, The American Indian Center of Chicago, The Chi-Nations Youth Council and over 1,500 Native organizations and advocates from over 150 federally recognized tribes across the country support changing the team name and logo. Since July 2020, headdresses have been banned from being worn at Blackhawk home games. History The National Hockey League (NHL)'s Chicago Blackhawks was named in honor of the U.S. 86th Infantry Division, which was nicknamed the \\"Blackhawk Division\\" after Black Hawk, a Native American chief; the team's founder, Frederic McLaughlin, having served in that division. Blackhawk was a leader of the Sauk who sided with the British in the War of 1812 and later attempted to regain tribal land in the Black Hawk War of 1832. Opponents of the logo say that adoption of his name for the 86th Infantry, the hockey team, and later for the Blackhawk helicopter are an example of designating certain Native Americans as \\"worthy adversaries\\". Controversy Suzan Shown Harjo (Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee) who was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom for decades of American Indian advocacy and is President of the Morning Star Institute,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/11/10/president- obama-announces-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients says the Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams using Native imagery because hockey is not a cultural force on the level of football. American Indian organizations have called for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. \\"It lacks dignity,\\" she said. \\"There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or entertainment or fun.\\" The National Congress of American Indians also opposes the Blackhawks' logo, as it does all Native American mascots. In 2010, sports columnist Damien Cox called on the franchise to retire the \\"racially insensitive\\" logo, saying that: \\"Clearly, no right-thinking person would name a team after an aboriginal figure these days any more than they would use Muslims or Africans or Chinese or any ethnic group to depict a specific sporting notion.\\" Ghislain Picard, the head of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador, says he would support the change of the logo to one designed by an Ojibwe artist featuring a black hawk. In 2015, the owner of the NHL Winnipeg Jets decided to ban fake Native headdresses at games after meeting with First Nations leaders. The meeting took place in response to a complaint by a Jets fan after seeing a Blackhawks fan in a headdress. Addressing the controversy The Blackhawks have worked with the American Indian Center to help inform their community and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, Executive Counsel for the American Indian Center weighed in on the logo and name controversy by stating, \\"There is a consensus among us that there's a huge distinction between a sports team called the Redskins depicting native people as red, screaming, ignorant savages and a group like the Blackhawks honoring Black Hawk, a true Illinois historical figure.\\" However, this stance is markedly different from the one previously taken by the American Indian Center, with the shift coming only in the past few years. In 2010, for instance, Joe Podlasek stated that, \\"The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?\\" John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position for the American Indian Center may be connected to contributions the Blackhawks organization has recently begun making to the center: \\"We all do contributions, but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've done that's offensive.\\" In 2019, the American Indian Center of Chicago ended all ties to the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation, stating they will no longer affiliate \\"with organizations that perpetuate stereotypes through the use of \\"Indian\\" mascots.\\" The AIC noted in its statement that they \\"previously held a relationship with the Chicago Blackhawks Foundation with the intention of educating the general public about American Indians and the use of logos and mascots. The AIC, along with members of the community have since decided to end this relationship\\" and stated that \\"going forward, AIC will have no professional ties with the Blackhawks, or any other organization that perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\\" After the Washington Redskins announced that they would be changing their name in July 2020, the Blackhawks confirmed that they would continue to use their team name. However, the team did agree to ban Native American headdresses at home games held in the United Center in recognition of being sacred symbols. Before the ban was enacted, there had in fact been incidents where some Blackhawk fans wore headdresses.

The village site is designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.  Name  The anglicized name Tanu (anachronistically spelled Tanoo) derives from the Haida (XÃ±aayda Kil) word t'aanuu, meaning eel grass ‚Äì referring to the abundant sea grass found at the mouth of the village. Historically, European newcomers commonly referred to the village as ‚ÄúKlue‚Äôs Village‚Äù (alternatively spelled Kloo, Clue, or Clew), referring to the original town chief, Xe-u (meaning 'Southeast Wind'). Note that the village New Clew (K‚Äôaadas Guu Gandlaay) at Church Creek in the Cumshewa Inlet on Moresby Island is often mistaken for the village of Tanu.  History  Beach and trees at Tanu, Haida Gwaii According to George F. MacDonald, basing his estimation off of the accounts given by informants to John R. Swanton during the 1900-1901 Jesup Expedition, the town of Tanu likely did not exist earlier than 1735, approximating that the town was in existence for 110 to 165 years before the time of the village‚Äôs final resident town chief, GÃ≤itkun John Williams, at the turn of the 20th century. The first settlers at Tanu arrived from Cumshewa Inlet, of the two closely aligned Eagle lineages, Those-Born-at-Skedans (K‚Äôuuna) and the Djigua-Town-People ‚Äì among the most powerful Eagle families on the islands at the time. The first town chief of Tanu, Xe-u, was a member of the former. The village was recorded to have a population of 545 inhabitants at around 1840 by John Work of the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, making it one of the largest in the archipelago. Following multiple waves of epidemics (most notably the 1862 smallpox epidemic), the population had been reduced to only 150 inhabitants by 1884, and fell further to 80 individuals by 1887. The decision to relocate was made that year, with the surviving population moving north and establishing the village of New Clew, near the ancestral ‚Äòold story town‚Äô of Djigua. The new village was occupied until 1897; the residents then followed the island-wide consolidation of the Haida people to Graham island, and settled at the southern town of Skidegate. Visiting the village in 1883, James G. Swan recorded that there were thirty-one mortuary poles and fifteen mortuary houses, far outnumbering the remaining frontal house poles and longhouses. MacDonald speculates that soon before the relocation to New Clew, the mortuary remains of more than fifty individuals were interred in a mass gravesite at the prompting of Christian missionaries.  Village site  The village site at Tanu, Haida Gwai. Tanu is designated as a Haida Heritage Site by Parks Canada and the Council of the Haida Nation, and the site is co-managed by the joint venture of Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site, though it is not included as part of the park reserve due to its zoning within Tanoo Indian Reserve No. 9. The site today retains three visible house-pits and a number of house-beams along the forest undergrowth, along with a number of monumental poles in various stages of decomposition. It is among the sites covered by the Haida Gwaii Watchmen Program, and has a resident Watchman on- site between May and October each year to welcome visitors and provide information of its history. Two ancestral frontal poles of the village were removed in the 1930s by B.C. Packers, and moved to Prince Rupert to be displayed in a local park. In response to worsening conditions of the poles, they were relocated in 1965 to the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria (which, along with the Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver and the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, houses other poles that were taken from Tanu). In 1976, the two poles were among the first Haida cultural artifacts to be reclaimed in repatriation efforts led by the ·∏¥ay Llnagaay Haida Heritage Centre, where they are currently housed in the Xaayda Sahlinda Naay (lit. ‚ÄòSaving Things House‚Äô). The ashes of Iljuwas Bill Reid were buried in Tanu following his death in 1998, near the birthplace of his maternal grandmother, Josephine, of the Kaadaas gaah Kiiguwaay Wolf clan Raven moiety. His headstone joins others that have been placed there by descendants of Tanu chiefs living in Skidegate.

Prior to assuming the role at State Department, he was president and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis. On July 19, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Mitchell as Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs. He was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate in September 2017. On January 22, 2019, it was announced Mitchell would resign from his post in February. Early life Aaron Wess Mitchell is a sixth generation Texan who was born in Lubbock, Texas in 1977. He received his B.A. in history from Texas Tech University. He received his M.A. in German and European studies from the BMW Center for German and European Studies at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. While studying there, he was awarded the 2004 Hopper Award. He received his DPhil in Political Science from the Otto-Suhr-Institut f√ºr Politikwissenschaft from the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. Career Mitchell co-founded the Center for European Policy Analysis in 2005 at the age of twenty-eight. CEPA is a non-profit, non-partisan public policy research institute that studies Central and Eastern Europe. Before co-founding CEPA, Mitchell was a research associate at the National Center for Policy Analysis. At CEPA, the bulk of Mitchell's reports and articles advanced the argument that the United States should increase its diplomatic and military engagement with allies in Central and Eastern Europe and East Asia that could otherwise fall under Russian or Chinese influence. Mitchell was among the earliest proponents of placing U.S. and NATO military personnel in Poland and the Baltic States in the aftermath of the 2008 Russo-Georgia War. He was a critic of the Obama Administration's U.S.-Russia Reset. In November 2008 he wrote that \\"Moscow could precipitate a major crisis in Ukraine within [the Obama administration‚Äôs] first two years in office.\\" In 2009 he wrote: \\"Signs of [U.S.] retreat... regional democrats and embolden Moscow to push its luck elsewhere, particularly in Ukraine.\\" Mitchell was an early proponent of using deterrence-by-denial to defend vulnerable U.S. allies like Estonia or Taiwan from Russian or Chinese attack. Where deterrence-by-punishment seeks to dissuade aggression by threatening retaliation against the attacker, deterrence-by-denial seeks to dissuade aggression by making the object of attack itself more resistant to attack. In his historical writing, Mitchell has focused mainly on the Habsburg Empire. In his 2018 book The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire, Mitchell argued that Austria successfully managed over-extended frontiers against numerous stronger rivals by employing strategies of time-management that allowed it to sequence military contests and avoid contests of strength beyond its ability to bear. A Wall Street Journal article about the Habsburg Empire that Mitchell co-authored with Purdue University historian Charles Ingrao received the Stanton Prize for using applied history to illuminate contemporary challenges. In 2012, Mitchell was an adviser to the national security transition team for the Mitt Romney presidential campaign. Mitchell is the author of three books, The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire (Princeton University Press, 2018), The Unquiet Frontier: Vulnerable Allies, Rising Rivals and the Crisis of American Power with Jakub J. Grygiel (Princeton University Press, 2016) and The Godfather Doctrine: A Foreign Policy Parable with John Hulsman (Princeton University Press, 2009). Mitchell and Grygiel's 2016 book Unquiet Frontier has been cited as having had a significant influence on National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster's formulation of the 2017 U.S. National Security Strategy and the shift of emphasis in U.S. foreign policy to great-power competition. The book argues that rising and revisionist powers, Russia and China, are \\"probing\\" the periphery of the U.S.-led international order by placing pressure on U.S. allies, and that the United States should strengthen its alliances as a way of achieving strategic stability. As Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, Mitchell was responsible for diplomatic relations with the 50 countries of Europe and Eurasia, as well as the institutions of NATO, the EU, and OSCE. He was seen as an advocate for strengthening NATO, for providing military assistance to Ukraine and Georgia, and for stepping up U.S. efforts to counter Russia and China. In August 2018 testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Mitchell stated: > \\"Russia and China are serious competitors that are building up the material > and ideological wherewithal to contest U.S. primacy and leadership in the > 21st Century. It continues to be among the foremost national security > interests of the United States to prevent the domination of the Eurasian > landmass by hostile powers.\\" Mitchell was seen as an architect of State Department efforts to increase U.S. engagement with states in East-Central Europe, the Caucasus, and Western Balkans as a means of countering Russian and Chinese geopolitical influence. Mitchell was also seen as a driver of greater U.S. involvement in the Eastern Mediterranean, including through the deepening of U.S. ties with Greece, Cyprus and Israel. He played a role in the resolution of the Greece-North Macedonia name dispute that created the possibility for North Macedonia to join NATO. In a January 4, 2019 letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mitchell stated personal and professional reasons for his decision to resign from his post. In an interview, he said he had not taken this decision in a protest at the Trump administration's policies. Mitchell's resignation, which became publicly known on January 22, became effective in February 2019. Mitchell currently serves as Vice Chairman of the Center for European Policy Analysis, as Senior Advisor at the Office of Strategic Stability and Security at the United States Institute of Peace, as a Non-Resident Fellow in the Applied History Project at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, and as a member of the international advisory board for Cambridge University's Centre for Geopolitics. He previously served as a Chair of the Europe Group for the John Hay Initiative, and as a member of the advisory councils of the Richard G. Lugar Institute for Diplomacy and Congress, the Slovak Atlantic Commission, the Prague Center for Transatlantic Relations, the Atlantic Initiative, and the Alexander Hamilton Society. On March 31, 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg appointed Mitchell co-chair of NATO's high-level Reflection Group, a commission of senior experts tasked with providing recommendations to the Secretary General for strengthening the political cohesion and decision-making of the Alliance.

The fire was reported on August 29, 2017. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but is believed to be human-caused. The fire was completely extinguished on November 29, after it had burned . The fire threatened old growth sequoia trees, the Tule River Indian Reservation, and many small communities in the area. The Fire The Pier Fire was first reported on August 29 at 2:30 AM. The fire was spotted in the Tule River Canyon just north of Springville, California (reportedly, the fire was started by an individual or individuals who had stolen a car, set it on fire and pushed it into a ravine, which then caught fire. Since the site where the fire started was in a national forest, federal authorities along with state authorities are investigating). By the end of the day the fire had burned north and south of Highway 190 in Giant Sequoia National Monument in Sequoia National Forest. This led to numerous mandatory evacuations in the area and the closure of Highway 190 in select areas. By August 30, the fire had grown to and threatened the Tule River Reservation and two groves of sequoia trees: Mountain Home Grove and Black Mountain Grove. Crews had limited access to the fire due to the steep slopes, heavy fuels and limited roads. Highway 190 remained closed in some sections and Balch Park and Mountain Home Demonstration State Forest were both closed. On September 1, the fire grew to . The fire jumped Highway 190 and the middle fork of the Tule River, nearing campgrounds.

Pohto was an uneducated man of peasant stock who is known for his collection that saved a significantly large number of pre-19th century Finnish literature.  Life  Pohto was born into a poor peasants' family in the Western Finnish Ostrobothnia region. At the age of eight, Pohto worked as a herder, and also earned his living by begging. Later he worked as a bookbinder, and started collecting books in 1838 at the age of 21. Pohto acquired most of his books from manor houses and vicarages throughout Finland. In 1847 he got to know Fredrik Wilhelm Pipping, the librarian of the Royal Academy of Turku. The library had been destroyed in the 1827 Great Fire of Turku. With Pohto's assistance, Pipping succeeded in collecting almost all Finnish literature printed thus far and re-established the library collection in the nation's new capital Helsinki. In 1857, Pipping published a bibliography of Finnish literature, about 5,000 of 6,603 titles of these were collected by Pohto. His books are now in the collections of the National Library of Finland. Pohto was murdered in July 1857 on his way to Saint Petersburg. He was staying at a farmhouse in the village of Nuoraa, near Vyborg, and was killed by a farmhand. The man struck Pohto on the head with an axe: he had been coughed on by Pohto and, fearful of contracting tuberculosis, was panicked into the violent act. Pohto was buried in the Ristim√§ki Cemetery in Vyborg, in present-day Russia. In 1988 his memorial was moved to Helsinki, where it was placed in the courtyard of the University of Helsinki library.

TV/DC Comics series Gotham, based on the character of the same name who is the secret identity of DC Comics superhero Batman, created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. Gotham portrays Bruce's teenage years and transition into adapting his Batman personality in later years. The series marks the second time Batman was adapted for live- action television after the 1960s Batman series, though the lead character in Gotham is James Gordon. Bruce is portrayed by David Mazouz while Mikhail Mudrik had an uncredited role as the adult Bruce in the series finale (with Mazouz providing the character's voice). Bruce Wayne is the orphaned son of Thomas and Martha Wayne, who are murdered at the beginning of the series by a masked gunman. After the incident, Bruce began to question the inner workings of Gotham City, and along with his allies, seeks to uncover the corruption destroying Gotham and get to the reason behind his parents' murder. In the process, he begins the training that shapes his destiny as a feared vigilante.  Character development  After long efforts were made to create a television series based on Batman's origins with little success, Gotham was conceived by Bruno Heller and was eventually picked up by Fox. Though the series eventually focused on James Gordon, chronicling his rise to commissioner of the Gotham City police, Bruce Wayne remained a central character. David Mazouz went through a long audition before finally winning the role of Bruce, hearing the news after attending school one day. Mazouz cites Batman comics as main inspiration for playing his character. For the series finale, which flashes forward ten years into the future from the rest of the series, an older actor provides the body double for the adult Bruce in his vigilante suit during action sequences, but Mazouz provides the character's voice and is seen in the suit for closeup shots. Mazouz said that Gotham characterizes Bruce as wise beyond his years, and that he was drawn to the character's maturity:  Role in Gotham  Bruce is introduced as the 12-year-old son of wealthy businessman Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha. Thomas is the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, a vast multinational corporation that is secretly actually controlled by the secret organization The Court of Owls. After Bruce's parents are murdered, he embarks on a mission to find their killer and protect Gotham City from criminals.  Season 1  In the pilot episode of the series, Bruce witnesses a mugger murder his parents. As the Gotham City Police Department arrives, detective Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie) comforts Bruce at the scene and promises to find his parents' killer. Though Gordon and his partner Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue) find the alleged killer, Mario Pepper (Daniel Stewart Sherman), and gun him down, they later realize that mobster Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) framed him and that the real killer is still at large. Bruce becomes obsessed with finding the real killer, and with training himself to become a vigilante. Alfred Pennyworth (Sean Pertwee), the Waynes' butler and Bruce's guardian following their deaths, is troubled by Bruce's behavior, but nevertheless agrees to train him in armed and unarmed combat, and becomes his guide and mentor. Bruce later meets street orphans Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova) and Ivy Pepper (Claire Foley); unbeknownst to Bruce, Selina witnessed the murder of his parents, and Ivy is the daughter of the wrongly accused murderer. Bruce and Selina become close as Selina temporarily stays at Wayne Manor for shelter. Bruce becomes skeptical of how his father's company is run and is convinced that someone in the company wanted his parents dead. With Selina's help, he infiltrates Wayne Enterprises and gains access to crucial information. Though the executive he was trying to spy on catches him, Bruce encounters Lucius Fox (Chris Chalk) in the aftermath of being caught. Fox offers to help him, revealing that Thomas Wayne did not approve of the corruption behind the company. Alfred and Bruce later find a secret cave underneath Wayne Manor belonging to his father.  Season 2  Bruce digs further into Wayne Manor, and finds a letter from his father telling him to choose between \\"happiness or truth\\". He also finds a computer that appears to have vital information about Wayne Enterprises, but Alfred attempts to stop Bruce from investigating further out of concern for his safety, even smashing the computer. Bruce refuses to back down and fires Alfred, but later relents and hires him back under the condition they work together. Bruce, Selina and Alfred later attend a charity ball that is infiltrated by criminals led by Jerome Valeska (Cameron Monaghan) and Barbara Kean (Erin Richards). When Alfred's life is threatened by the intrusion, Bruce goes back for him and is almost killed himself before Theo Galavan (James Frain), a wealthy industrialist, intervenes and kills Jerome. Galavan turns out to actually be the leader of the criminals, masterminding the event to make himself look like a hero while secretly planning to destroy the Wayne family. Galavan poses as a father figure to gain Bruce's trust, and Bruce grows close to Galavan's niece Silver St. Cloud (Natalie Alyn Lind). Galavan eventually reveals his true colors and kidnaps Bruce and Silver. With help from Selina, Gordon and Galavan's sister Tabitha (Jessica Lucas), Bruce escapes and saves Silver's life, leaving Theo there before Gordon and crime boss Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) confront and kill Theo. The second half of season two has Bruce continuing to track down his parents' killer. Alfred eventually confronts Bruce and confirms the name of the killer as Patrick \\"Matches\\" Malone (Michael Bowen). After receiving a gun from Selina and finding Matches' location, Bruce confronts Matches in the latter's apartment, only to find that Matches was contracted by another source that he refuses to name. Matches, who is suicidal, begs Bruce to put him out of his misery, but Bruce refuses, leaving Matches to shoot himself. Bruce then decides to live in the streets with Selina in order to learn what it takes to fight crime in Gotham. He returns once Fox fixes his father's computer. Soon afterward, Bruce, Fox, and Alfred discover that Hugo Strange (B.D. Wong), a former colleague of Thomas Wayne, was the one who ordered the hit. Strange had been conducting mutation experiments within Wayne Enterprises' Indian Hills program; when Thomas shut the program down, Strange retaliated by having him killed. When the GCPD refuses to indict Strange due to a lack of evidence, Bruce personally heads to Indian Hills with Selina to confront Strange, who unleashes a number of mutated monsters onto the city and captures Bruce, Lucius, and Alfred. The GCPD intervenes when Strange threatens to blow the facility up, arresting Strange and freeing the captives. Strange's monsters continue to roam the streets, however, one of them including a teenage boy who resembles Bruce himself.  Season 3  Upon further investigation, Bruce encounters the Court of Owls, an organization revealed to be pulling the strings in Wayne Enterprises. The leader of the Court, Kathryn Monroe (Leslie Hendrix), offers Bruce a deal: if he stops investigating them, they will spare his life and those of his loved ones. Bruce reluctantly agrees. Bruce eventually encounters and fights his doppelg√§nger, faces off against a resurrected Jerome, enters a relationship with Selina, and is kidnapped and trained by a mysterious Shaman (Raymond Barry), later meeting Ra's al Ghul (Alexander Siddig) in the process. In the season's final scene, a masked Bruce dressed in military-grade body armor of his father's invention saves a family from a mugger.  Season 4  While training to fight crime as the \\"Dark Knight\\", Bruce starts investigating Ra's al Ghul, and learns that the mysterious terrorist wants to gain possession of a millennia-old dagger. Bruce buys the dagger at auction to draw Ra's out, but Ra's retaliates by killing Bruce's young friend Alex (Benjamin Stockham). Bruce becomes obsessed with avenging Alex, and confronts Ra's ‚Äì who surprises him by begging Bruce to put him out of his misery. Bruce refuses, but when Ra's threatens his loved ones, he loses control and stabs Ra's with the dagger. Bruce feels guilty for killing Ra's in cold blood, and falls into a deep depression. He numbs the pain by partying nonstop, fires Alfred and gives up his plan to protect Gotham. When Ivy (Peyton List) doses him with her hallucinogenic plant toxin, however, he sees a vision of a fearsome, mysterious cloaked entity ‚Äì implied to be his future self ‚Äì telling him that he cannot escape who he really is before dissolving into a swarm of bats. That night, he reconciles with Alfred, and prevents Ivy from killing a crowd full of Gotham's social elite at a charity auction. Meanwhile, he befriends Jerome Valeska's twin brother Jeremiah ‚Äì unaware that he is just as insane as his brother and planning to destroy Gotham. He is also unaware that Ra's has returned from the dead, and is conspiring with Jeremiah. When Ra's and Jeremiah reveal their plan, they both tell Bruce that they are destroying Gotham for his benefit, to help him become the \\"Dark Knight\\" he is destined to be. The two criminal masterminds kidnap Alfred and dose Bruce with Jonathan Crane's (Charlie Tahan) fear toxin, plaguing him with hallucinations of Alfred going insane and attacking him. When it wears off, he returns with Alfred and Selina to Wayne Manor ‚Äì where Jeremiah appears and shoots Selina in the stomach, injuring her spinal cord. After seeing Selina off to the hospital, he goes to confront Ra's and Jeremiah, who have destroyed all bridges leading outside of Gotham, turning the city into a \\"No Man's Land\\". During the ensuing struggle, Kean, Ra's' onetime lover and proteg√©, puts the dagger in Bruce's hand and forces him to stab Ra's, mortally wounding him. As he dies, Ra's tells Bruce that he must choose between simply being Bruce Wayne and becoming the \\"Dark Knight\\". After Gotham is evacuated, Bruce decides to stay behind and help Gordon fight the criminals who have taken over the city.  Season 5  Months later, Bruce is shown to be helping Gordon provide the people of the Narrows with food, shelter and medicine. He also uses herbs reluctantly supplied by Ivy to help Selina regain the ability to walk. When Selina goes after Jeremiah looking for revenge, he tries to stop her, but is unable to prevent her from stabbing and seemingly killing Jeremiah. She tearfully confesses to him that she saw his parents die and did nothing, and rejects his attempts to comfort her. Meanwhile, Jeremiah, who has become obsessed with Bruce, kidnaps him and tries to convince him of his plan to recreate the night that Bruce's parents were murdered. When Bruce refuses and sees the ruse, Jeremiah blows up Wayne Manor. Jeremiah then flees to Ace Chemicals, and in the ensuing struggle with Bruce falls into a vat of toxic waste. Soon afterward, Ivy uses her plant toxins to hypnotize Bruce and get him to poison Gotham's water supply. Selina manages to snap him out of it, and they defeat Ivy with help from Fox. Later, Bruce and Selina attend the wedding of Gordon and Leslie Thompkins (Morena Baccarin), and share a passionate kiss. Theresa Walker (Jaime Murray), the government operative who has been overseeing Gotham's reconstruction, reveals her true identity as Nyssa al Ghul, Ra's al Ghul's daughter, and pledges to avenge her father's death by killing Bruce. With help from Selina and Gordon, Bruce defeats Nyssa, but at a cost: Nyssa's henchman Bane (Shane West) severely injures Alfred. Bruce blames himself, and leaves Gotham so no one else he loves will be hurt. Before he leaves, he tells Alfred that he will be gone a long time, but that he will return once he is able to protect Gotham. Bruce decides to start his training for his war on crime. thumbBruce Wayne in his final costume, now Batman In the series finale ten years later, Bruce returns to Gotham, which has flourished with Gordon as Commissioner of the GCPD, to celebrate the opening of the new Wayne Tower. At the same time, a mysterious vigilante in a bat-like costume begins apprehending Gotham's wanted criminals, including Cobblepot, Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith), and a returned Jeremiah Valeska. This mysterious figure, whom Lucius and Alfred know is Bruce, also has a run-in with Selina (Lili Simmons), who has become a cat burglar, and has a quietly emotional exchange with her while concealed in the shadows. After escaping a prison van, Cobblepot and Nygma are frightened by the disguised Bruce using a grappling hook to glide between rooftops. Finally, Bruce quietly observes the city from afar atop a building as Gordon and Bullock summon him through a searchlight bearing a bat emblem, becoming Gotham's protector for years to come under a new name: Batman.  Reception  Mazouz has received praise for his portrayal of the teenage Bruce Wayne, with critics lauding his mature approach to portraying the character, especially for someone his age. However, there was some criticism for the perceived rushed pacing of Bruce's development in the show. In 2018, Mazouz was nominated for the Saturn Award for the Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series and the \\"Choice Action TV Actor\\" award at the Teen Choice Awards.

There are two classes in Assam, of which the Ganaks, who are also known as Daivajna, are one. That group follows the Atharva Veda (the solar cult). They are mostly called as \\"Bamun\\" or \\"Brahman\\" in Assamese language. They were originally priests. Religious worship in temples are generally done by them. There they promoted learning, Vedic religion and astrology, besides imparting general vedic knowledge to the public. Their origin was probably the Gangetic Plain: according to the Nidhanpur copper plate, around 200 Brahmin families of various gotras and ved‚Äìsakhas moved from there to Assam on the invitation of Bhutivarman in the 6th century CE.  History  Brahmins are considered to be one of the oldest Hindu settlers in the region and held the highest positions in society.

A sacred thread ‚Äì Lagun, given by a Pujari during the ceremony is a symbolic reminder to the young male born to the Brahmin family of his purpose at school, as well as a social marker of the student as someone who has embarked his journey into formal education, where education itself is not limited to ritual and philosophical speculations, but extends to all practical aspects of culture and life in general. The ceremony is typically performed between ages 12 ‚Äì 14 among Brahmin males. However many people now choose not to wear \\"Lagun\\".  Death rituals Brahmins of the valley follow a different death ritual as opposed to the other indigenous communities in Assam. A religious rite, known as CaturthƒÅ is performed on the 4th day of a person's demise unlike Tiloni, performed on the 3rd day of person's demise by non‚ÄìBrahmin indigenous communities.  Pujas Most Brahmin families are involved in performing religious rituals, known as Pujas. The main Pujas are as follows - Satyanarayan Puja, Maa Durga Puja, Shree Laxmi Puja, Shiva Puja, Shree Ganesha Puja, Saraswati Puja, Annapura Puja, Jagadhatri Puja and so on... Lifestyle Although in general Brahmins observe all the customary rituals, they appear usually less rigid in some of their traditional lifestyle choices, such as they may eat meat, fish, unlike their counterparts in North India.  Present  The Brahmins constitute one of the Forward classes of Assam based on the classifications of Government of India, although the recent trend on economic condition has not been very well within the community. Assam's former Chief Minister, Tarun Gogoi announced setting up of development councils for several communities in the state, including Brahmins.

The non-fiction book is framed as a story Mattick is telling to her son. Her great-grandfather, Harry Colebourn bought a bear on his way to fight in World War I, donating the bear to a zoo where it became the inspiration for the character of Winnie-the-Pooh. Finding Winnie was thoroughly researched by both Blackall and Mattick. The book's writing and illustrations well reviewed and it won the 2016 Caldecott Medal.  Background and publication  Sophie Blackall agreed to illustrate the book, even though she was not planning to accept new book assignments, because she felt that her own story was like that of the bear Winnie.Rich, S. (2016). The Audacious Choice of Sophie Blackall. Horn Book Magazine, 92(4), 51‚Äì55. Retrieved from ebscohost. In particular, Blackall, and the book's editor, both cited Blackall's decision to immigrate to New York just as Winnie would move from Canada to Europe.Blackall, S. (2016). Caldecott Medal Acceptance. Horn Book Magazine, 92(4), 44‚Äì50. Retrieved from ebscohost. Blackall also had an affinity for Winnie-the-Pooh, as the book was the first she ever bought with her own money. Author Lindsay Mattick loved hearing the story of her great- grandfather as a child. As an adult she learned more about her great- grandfather, who never knew his role in inspiring the book, while reading his diaries from fighting in World War I saying, \\"The joy and love Harry found in adopting Winnie is in stark contrast to the realities of WWI.\\" She was moved to write the book to explain her son Cole's name to him.HUNTER, S. (2015). Talking With LINDSAY MATTICK AND SOPHIE BLACKALL. Booklist, 112(1), 116. Retrieved from ebscohost. Before its publication the book's movie rights were optioned. The book was published in October 2015 and was later expanded into a 144-page book, Winnie's Great War. The original book was released as an audiobook in April 2016 and was narrated by Erin Moon. Synopsis The book is told by a mother, the author Mattick, telling a story of her great- grandfather to her son. In 1914, veterinarian Harry Colebourn, Mattick's grandfather, rides a train across Canada on his way to serve in World War I. Finding an orphaned female bear on the platform of a Winnipeg railway station for sale for $20 ($ today), he names it \\"Winnie\\" after his hometown of Winnipeg. After first being skeptical of the bear, she becomes Colebourn's regiment's mascot, accompanying the soldiers to training in England. When the regiment moves to the front in France, Colebourn finds a home for Winnie at London Zoo. There the bear makes friends with a boy named Christopher Robin and inspires A. A. Milne to write the story of Winnie-the-Pooh, while Colebourn returns home to Canada at the end of the war to start a family.

She spent a year illustrating the book, conducting extensive research in order to get details of the period correct, for instance taking a week just to draw the map of the zoo. Blackall used a box of family mementos from Mattick as a touchpoint. Mattick's \\"playful\\" writing complements Blackall's illustrations. The framing device of having it be a story told to a child helps to reinforce the book's theme of family. It also echoes Milne's work, with the voice of Cole paralleling that of Christopher Robin. Mattick was careful not to invent dialogue or otherwise deviate from the historical record found in her grandfather's diaries. Reception and awards The book was well received with starred reviews in Booklist, Horn Book, where reviewer Thom Barthelmess praised that, \\"The sum total is as captivating as it is informative, transforming a personal family story into something universally resonant,\\" and School Library Journal, which also gave a starred review to the audiobook. In The New York Times Book Review, Maria Russo praised the book and described it as \\"gorgeously illustrated.\\" Reviews compared the book to Sally M. Walker's Winnie: The True Story of the Bear That Inspired Winnie-the-Pooh which was published earlier in 2015. In a generally positive review, Jeannette Hulick in The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books noted the ethical implications of bringing a bear across the ocean and potentially to war are, \\"mostly glossed over by the book‚Äôs romanticizing of Colebourn‚Äôs decision.\\" Illustrator Blackall won the 2015 Caldecott Medal for the book. The win caused an additional 5000 copies to be sold in the first week after the award.JURIS, C. (2016). Finding an Audience. Publishers Weekly, 263(4), 11. Retrieved from ebscohost. In her acceptance speech Blackall expressed her gratitude for being awarded the medal and recalled, \\"I will remember the sound of our mingled laughing-and-crying for as long as I live.\\" The book publicized the fact that the historical bear Winnie was a female, setting-off speculation that the literary character was also a girl. This is generally thought not to be the case judging by the use of pronouns in Milne's book as well as the gender of Christopher Robin's bear doll, Edward.

The points plotted as part of an ogive are the upper class limit and the corresponding cumulative absolute frequency or cumulative relative frequency. The ogive for the normal distribution resembles one side of an Arabesque or ogival arch, which is likely the origin of its name.  Creation  Along the horizontal axis the limits of the class intervals for an ogive are marked. Based on the limit values, points above each are placed with heights equal to either the absolute or relative cumulative frequency. The shape of an ogive is obtained by connecting each of the points to its neighbours with line segments. Sometimes an axis for both the absolute frequency and relative is drawn.  Finding percentiles  Ogives, similarly to other representations of cumulative distribution functions, are useful for estimating centiles in a distribution. For example, we can know the central point so that 50% of the observations would be below this point and 50% above. To do this, we draw a line from the point of 50% on the axis of percentage until it intersects with the curve. Then we vertically project the intersection onto the horizontal axis. The last intersection gives us the desired value. The frequency polygon and ogive are used to compare two statistical sets whose number could be different.

Footage of the incident released on August 31, 2017 went viral online. The SLCPD announced policy changes which would affect how police should handle situations involving drawing blood, and the hospital announced it would also change its police protocol to avoid repeating the incident. Utah lawmakers made a bill to amend the blood draw policy of Utah law enforcement, which Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed into law on March 15, 2018. Incident On July 26, 2017, Marcos Torres, a pickup truck driver fleeing from Utah Highway Patrol troopers in Cache County, Utah, crashed head-on into a semi-truck. Torres, the pickup truck driver, died at the scene. William Gray, the semi- truck driver and a part-time police officer, was severely burned. He was taken into the University of Utah Hospital in a sedated and comatose state. Officers from the Salt Lake City Police Department arrived at the hospital and asked to get a blood sample from patient William Gray. Alex Wubbels was on-duty nurse at the time and she argued that the police request did not meet the legal requirements. According to Wubbels #the patient must be under arrest, or #a warrant must have been issued ordering the taking of a blood sample, or #the patient must give his or her consent. She cited to that effect the specific hospital policy, on which the police department had agreed, that would not permit her to provide the blood sample. Wubbels is shown in the Detective Jeff Payne's body cam video holding a cell phone in her palm. On the video, Payne can be heard saying, \\"She [Wubbels] is the one who has told me 'No'.\\" The remote person on that phone, assumed to be a hospital administrator, says > \\"Yeah, sir, but you're making a big mistake. Right now you are making a huge > mistake and are threatening a nurse-\\" At this point, Payne cuts the coversation off with an \\"OK\\" and makes a two- handed grab for her phone; when she pulls it away he says \\"No. We're done. We're done.\\", and then proceeds to arrest Wubbels. She was later released after spending 20 minutes in the police car in hand cuffs without any charges being brought against her. Gray never recovered from his wounds and died on September 25, 2017. Investigations & response At a press conference on August 31, 2017, nurse Wubbels and her attorney released footage of the incident taken from hospital surveillance and police body cameras. The footage of the incident soon went viral online. The SLCPD faced heavy criticism on social media for how it handled the incident. According to a statement posted by Salt Lake City mayor Jackie Biskupski, the SLCPD launched a 35-day internal affairs investigation into the arrest within 24 hours of the July 26 incident, starting with meeting the hospital's CEO and nursing management team. A state audit of this investigation found that the police department had followed policies for this investigation, though it suggested the SLCPD should work faster to publicize information that is in public interest. The Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill announced that his office was also investigating the arrest. Gill requested investigative assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). FBI spokeswoman Sandra Yi Barker said the agency opened a civil rights review after the video went public, agreed to help the county investigate the incident, and also opened a probe into the arrest. The Unified Police Department of Greater Salt Lake also investigated the arrest. The SLCPD publicly apologized to Wubbels for the arrest, and put officer Payne on paid leave on September 1, 2017. Another police officer connected to the incident was put on paid leave the next day. According to Payne's attorney, Payne had expressed a desire to apologize to Wubbels for the incident. On September 2, about a hundred Utahns gathered at a Utah Against Police Brutality rally near the SLCPD courtyard to call for Payne to be fired. The University of Utah police chief apologized to Wubbels on September 4, saying that the university police should have done more to protect her on the night she was arrested. On September 13, 2017, Jackie Biskupski, the mayor of Salt Lake City, said that the internal investigation revealed Payne and his watch commander, Lt. James Tracy, violated six separate staff policies during the incident, including policies regarding arrests and standards of conduct. A report from Salt Lake City's Police Civilian Review Board also alleged that Payne and Tracy violated police policies. It stated that Payne became upset and frustrated during the incident, eventually \\"[losing] control of his emotions.\\" Payne's lawyer said this report was based on speculation. On September 25, the Salt Lake Police Association, the police union, criticized the city for its treatment of the police officers involved in the incident. On October 11, 2017, Payne was fired by the police department and his commanding officer at the time of the incident, James Tracy, was demoted two ranks down to police officer. Payne had been already fired on September 5 from his part- time job as a paramedic for the private firm of Gold Cross Ambulance. Tracy appealed his demotion, arguing it amounted to \\"excessive discipline,\\" but the Salt Lake City's Civil Service Commission upheld it. Aftermath Following the incident, the SLCPD changed its policies on drawing blood. A police department spokeswoman said these changes require law enforcement to have consent or a warrant to draw blood, instead of just implied consent. These policy changes served as the model for police protocols announced by the SLCPD on October 12, 2017, which other police agencies in the Salt Lake Valley could choose to adopt. According to hospital officials, within weeks after the incident, they had implemented new rules meant to allow patient care staffers to focus on their work and minimize disputes in patient care units. The hospital announced these changes in September 2017, which included not allowing police officers in patient-care areas and having them speak with \\"house supervisors\\" instead of nurses. On October 31, 2017, Wubbels and her attorney announced that Salt Lake City and the University of Utah had agreed to settle the incident for $500,000. She said that part of the settlement would go toward efforts geared to making body cam footage easier for the public to obtain. On October 11, 2019, former police detective Jeff Payne filed a suit against the Salt Lake City Police Department, seeking more than $300,000 in damages and claiming that, in 2017, though following the orders of his commanding officer and complying with department policies, he was \\"wrongfully terminated.\\" Payne had been hired in August 2019 by the Weber County Sheriff's Office as a \\"part-time civilian corrections assistant,\\" the \\"second controversial high-profile hire\\" for the Sheriff‚Äôs Office \\"in recent months,\\" as the press reported, coming a few weeks after Kayla Dallof, a former University of Utah police detective who had been fired for showing a ‚Äúcomplete dereliction of duty,‚Äù was hired as a sheriff's deputy. Legislative effect On September 20, 2017, the Utah State Legislature's Judiciary Interim Committee voted unanimously in favor of drafting a bill that would clarify consent laws regarding police-ordered blood draws. On November 15, 2017, a legislative committee drafted a bill that, mainly, would require police officers to take a blood draw only with the person's oral or written consent, through presenting a warrant, or presenting a judicially recognized exception to a warrant. Representative Craig Hall, R-West Valley City, who was a member of the drafting committee, stated that \\"there are situations where a blood draw is necessary and justified\\" but the new legislation \\"takes that decision out of the police officer's hands,\\" adding that \\"electronic warrants take about 10 minutes to obtain, so there's really no reason not to get one.\\" On January 25, 2018, the Utah House of Representatives voted 72‚Äì0 to pass the bill, numbered HB43. On January 31, Alex Wubbels testified to the State's Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee in support of the bill. The Salt Lake City Police, the Utah Highway Patrol, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, and the Libertas Institute also expressed their support during the hearings. The Committee voted 6‚Äì0 in favor of passing the bill. Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed it on March 15, 2018, and the legislation went into effect on May 8, 2018. See also *Birchfield v.

Upon its discovery, the fire had burned a mere The fire grew slowly and by August 6, it was already 10% contained at . Fire crews camped out near the fire due to its remote location, utilizing a helicopter for transportation. At this time, preventative measures were passed prohibiting fires (including campfires) outside of approved recreation areas and no smoking within 3 feet of vegetation. By August 24, the fire's containment dropped to 5% and it's acreage grew to , due to low humidity and a heat settlement in the area. Numerous trails were closed on this day, including parts of the Continental Divide Trail. Hikers traveling along the trail were rerouted to Montana Highway 200. On August 25, the fire had crossed the Continental Divide. Due to extremely dry temperatures and gusty wind conditions, the fire spread to over by August 27. Mandatory evacuations were started for residents of the Elk Meadows subdivision and ranches west of Road 434/435 and north of Highway 200. A shelter was opened by the American Red Cross in Helena. At this time, fire crews launched actions to protect homes in the Elk Meadows/Evergreen subdivisions, seeking to keep the fire in the National Forest and protecting 13 homes and ranches. Processes also began to minimize impact on the Alice Creek Historic District and to prevent aquatic animals from being transported over the Continental Divide. At this time, the fire was at . On August 31, two National Guard Chinook helicopters arrived on the scene of the fire to provide water delivery support to firefighters. September These helicopters would help contribute to the 5% containment that would be met by September 2. However, erratic behavior of the fire would force the evacuation of eight more homes in Elk Meadows. The fire remained at 5% containment, but had grown to , therefore the Forest expanded closures in the area. A Chinook helicopter dropping water on the Alice Creek Fire Alice Creek Basin and Tom's Gulch were evacuated on September 3. The Lewis & Clark County Sheriff issued mandatory evacuation orders for two more subdivisions on September 4: Landers Fork and Elk Trail. Highway 200 was reopened. On September 7, the fire spread into Tom's Gulch, Alice Creek and Telephone Gulch. Mandatory evacuations were put in place for 12 residents between Mile Marker 92 and Highway 434 along Highway 200 due to movement near the Elk Meadows/Evergreen subdivision. The next day, September 8, Highway 200 was re-opened to the public, however, 11 more residents were evacuated in the area. As of September 9, the Alice Creek Fire had burned and was at zero containment. Evacuation impacted approximately 90 individuals. Four structures, located on Bedrock Road, were destroyed in the fire. Fire crews continued to work to protect structures in subdivisions and in areas near Alice Creek Lake, Silver King Lake and along Highway 200. By the 11th, the fire had moved along Highway 200, on the west side. Two days of rain later in the week helped calm the fire. Firefighters focused on cleaning mud laden roads and to monitor containment lines. Evacuation orders were revoked for residents, with areas remaining closed for visitors.

History The company was formed by Cleveland real estate developer Jeffrey Jacobs. In 1995, it announced a joint venture with Black Hawk Gaming & Development to build a casino hotel in Black Hawk, Colorado. Jacobs was also reported to be exploring gaming opportunities in 10 other states and South Africa and Aruba. Later that year, the company purchased 50 percent of Colonial Downs, a horse track under development in New Kent, Virginia, for $5 million, and was negotiating to purchase River Downs, an Ohio horse track. In 1996, the company made a $9 million investment in the Boardwalk Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The Lodge Casino, the company's $73-million joint venture with Black Hawk Gaming, opened in 1998, with Jacobs owning a 25 percent share. In 2002, Jeffrey Jacobs and his father, Richard Jacobs, consolidated their gaming holdings into a reorganized Jacobs Entertainment, which simultaneously purchased all outstanding shares of Black Hawk Gaming & Development and Colonial Holdings. The combined company at that point owned the Lodge Casino and Gilpin Casino in Black Hawk; the Gold Dust West Casino in Reno, Nevada; Colonial Downs racetrack; and six truck stop casinos in Louisiana. The company applied for a license to operate a casino in Orange County, Indiana in 2003, but withdrew its bid in the face of stiff competition. It also made plans to develop a casino in D'Iberville, Mississippi, but pulled out of the project in 2004. Jacobs held discussions about buying New York racetrack Vernon Downs in 2005, and Casino Aztar Caruthersville in Missouri in 2007, but neither acquisition materialized. In 2006, Jacobs spent over $2 million in support of an Ohio ballot measure that would have authorized the company to open a casino at the Nautica Entertainment Complex, owned by Jeffrey Jacobs. The measure failed. Jacobs purchased the Pi√±on Plaza casino in Carson City, Nevada in 2006 for $14.5 million, and rebranded it as the Gold Dust West Carson City. The company opened its third casino under the Gold Dust West name in Elko, Nevada in 2007. In 2008 and 2009, the company bought out the shares of Richard Jacobs, leaving his son as the sole owner. The company acquired the Nautica Entertainment Complex from Jeffrey Jacobs in phases between 2008 and 2012. It then purchased the Greater Cleveland Aquarium, located in the complex, in 2014. Jacobs offered itself for sale to MTR Gaming in 2013 for $145 million in stock, but withdrew the offer after MTR agreed to be acquired by Eldorado Resorts. The Jacobses had begun purchasing shares in MTR Gaming in 2006, eventually accumulating an 18 percent stake in the company. Later in the year, Jacobs made a competing offer to buy MTR, and then withdrew it after Eldorado increased its offer. Since 2008, Jacobs has pursued plans to develop a casino in Diamondhead, Mississippi. The state gaming commission rejected the proposal in March 2017, but the company filed an appeal. Jacobs purchased the Sands Regency Casino Hotel in Reno, a few blocks away from the Gold Dust West casino, for $30 million in July 2017. The company soon began a $500-million plan to redevelop the corridor between the two casinos with mixed-use developments and retail and entertainment venues. In April 2018, Jacobs sold Colonial Downs, which had been closed since 2014. The track was sold to Revolutionary Racing, a Chicago-based group of investors and gaming executives, for a price of more than $20 million.

As three-year-old in 1978 he won two minor races before recording his first important victory in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes. In the following year he showed little worthwhile form in his first three starts but then had his biggest success when taking the Group 1 Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes on his final racecourse appearance. After his retirement from racing, he became a breeding stallion in Ireland before being exported to South Africa where he had some success as a sire of winners. Background Fordham was an \\"attractive\\" bay horse bred in Kentucky by the Irish-based Lyonstown Stud. The colt was sent to race in Europe where he entered training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. During his racing career he carried the green and blue colours of the British businessman Robert Sangster. His sire Forli was a champion in his native Argentina before becoming a successful breeding stallion in the United States. His best-known offspring was Forego, the three-time American Horse of the Year, whilst his European runners included Thatch and Sadeem. Fordham was the first foal produced by Bold Enchantress who won one minor race in Ireland as a two-year- old in 1972. She was a daughter of Princessnesian and a granddaughter of Alanesian, making her a close relative of many good winners including Boldnesian, Asiatic Boy, Devil May Care, Cryptoclearance and Revidere. Racing career 1978: three-year-old season Fordham was unraced as a two-year-old and did not appear on a racecourse until June 1978 when he won a minor race over one mile at Leopardstown. He was then moved up in distance and assigned top weight for a handicap race over ten furlongs at the same track in which he finished second by a head to the filly Endeavorer. The colt was then dropped back to nine furlongs and won a minor event at Leopardstown in July. In September the colt was sent to England and stepped up in class and distance for the Group 3 Cumberland Lodge Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse and started at odds of 4/1 against a field which included the Park Hill Stakes winner Idle Waters. Ridden by Pat Eddery he took the lead five furlongs from the finish, went clear of the field in the straight, and stayed on to win by one and a half lengths from Idle Waters who dead-heated for second with the four-year-old Town and Country. At the end of the year Fordham was given a rating of 116 by the independent Timeform organisation, making him 22 pounds inferior to his stablemate Alleged who was Timeform's Horse of the Year, and 15 pounds behind their best three-year-old colt Ile de Bourbon. In the official International Classification he was rated 14 pounds behind Ile de Bourbon, who was the top-rated three-year-old. 1979: four-year-old season Fordham struggled for form in his first three races of 1979. He finished unplaced over ten furlongs on his first two starts he finished fourth behind the five-year-old Orchestra in the Whitehall Stakes over nine furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse in early September. On 22 September Fordham, equipped with blinkers, was one of six horses to contest the fourth running of the Group 1 Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown. He was partnered by Tommy Carberry, a jockey best known for his successes under National Hunt rules. The three-year-old Dickens Hill started odds-on favourite ahead of the British colt Two of Diamonds (Dee Stakes) and Orchestra with Fordham next in the betting on 14/1 alongside Icelandic (John Porter Stakes). Fordham went to the front soon after the start, opened up a clear lead on the final turn and kept on well in the straight to hold off the late run of Two of Diamonds to win by three-quarters of a length. He never raced again and was retired to stud at the end of the year. Timeform gave Fordham a slightly improved rating of 117 for his performances in 1979 twenty pounds behind their Horse of the Year Troy. The International Classification saw him again rated 14 pounds behind Ile de Bourbon, who was the highest-rated older horse. Stud record Fordham began his career as a breeding stallion at the Coolmore Stud in 1980. He was exported to South Africa in 1982 and his last foals were born in 1988. The best of his offspring was probably the mare Kiss of Peace who four times at Grade 1 level in South Africa.

In 1983, it was introduced in the United States and became the number one selling cookware set for a number of years. Visions is made of Calexium, a transparent material belonging to the Pyroceram family of glass-ceramics. It is one of the few cookware lines than can be used on the range (gas and electric), in the oven (conventional, convection, and microwave), and under a broiler. It will withstand heat up to with thermal traits similar to Corning Ware plus improved resistance to staining and the detrimental effects of acids and detergents. Visions is sold worldwide by Corelle Brands, LLC.  History  In 1953 S. Donald Stookey of the Corning Research and Development Division discovered Pyroceram, an opaque- white glass-ceramic material with a high thermal shock resistance. Included in his subsequent patents were references to a transparent variation of this material, as well. While Pyroceram would quickly go on to be used for a variety of products, including Corning Ware cookware, the transparent version (later to be known as Calexium) was heavily studied over the next two decades. In 1963 George Beall, working under Stookey, explored a method for making transparent cookware. However, by 1966 Corning decided against commercializing it for fear that it would cannibalize Pyrex sales. In 1977, Andre Andrieu and Serge Renault working for Corning France, patented the claim that would form the basis for amber-tinted, transparent Vision cookware. It was produced in France and released for the European market in 1979 to instant success. Corning Le CLAIR (VISION) 2.5L Stewpot In 1981, Corning Glass Works began test marketing the cookware in the United States as an imported product under the name ‚ÄúLe CLAIR‚Äù rather than VISION due to a trademark conflict over the name. Once the trademark obstacles were overcome, the product finally received an official rollout in the second half of 1983 under the name ‚ÄúVISIONS‚Äù. Sales spiked during the mid-1980s when Corning released a series of television commercials showing a traditional piece of metal cookware being melted inside a transparent Visions pot, touting the product line as withstanding heat that will \\"turn ordinary sauce pans into sauce.\\" It would become the number one selling cookware set for the next several years. Due to increased demand, Corning opened additional production lines in the US and Brazil. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Corning released additional Visions products lines including limited \\"Sculptured\\" versions for high-end dept stores, non-stick versions featuring a Silverstone coating, and additional colors. Sales declined in the US over the 1990s and early 2000s and the product line is now sold at higher end price points via \\"CorningWare, Corelle, & More\\" outlet stores and Corelle Brands websites. Visions has remained popular overseas, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region where custom product lines have been created specifically for that market. Typically seen in an amber tint, a cranberry colored version was available from 1992 until 2004. A white variation was available in Europe as \\"White Visions\\" and in the US in limited supply under the name \\"Pyromax\\". Visions was temporarily unavailable in the United States from 2004 until 2006 but has otherwise been produced non-stop for nearly 40 years and is currently sold worldwide by Corelle Brands, LLC.  Calexium  Visions cookware is made of a transparent, beta-quartz material called Calexium, belonging to the Pyroceram family of glass-ceramics. This material and a method of making it was first referenced in a patent filed by S. Donald Stookey, of the Corning Research and Development Division, in 1958. It was described as being a semi-crystalline ceramic having unique and useful properties such as coefficient of thermal expansion so low as to be negative in character, a true porosity of zero, and the unusual characteristic of being transparent despite a substantial crystal content (often greater than 75% by volume). In a further patent, filed in 1976, Kenneth Chyung described it as an ideal material for cookware and kitchen materials and \\"unquestionably better\\" in the areas of infra-red transmittance, stain resistance, and chemical durability than two existing Pyroceramic glasses used for Corning Ware and \\"The Counter That Cooks\\". Thanks to Calexium's extremely high thermal shock resistance, food can be stored in the freezer in a piece of Visions and immediately taken to the stovetop or oven for cooking. Since the material is completely non-porous, it will never harbor food odors or leach chemicals into meals. Additionally, it is completely dishwasher safe and is not prone to haze or etching typically experienced with normal glass kitchenware. In general, this ceramic-glass family is composed approximately, as calculated from precursor glass batches in percent by weight on an oxide basis, of: * 68.2% is Silica Sand (SiO2) * 19.2% is Dialuminum Oxide (Al2O3) * 2.8% Lithium Oxide (Li2O) * 1.8% Magnesium Oxide (MgO) * 1.0% Zinc Oxide (ZnO) * 0.75% Barium Oxide (BaO) * 2.7% Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) * 1.75% Zirconium Dioxide (ZrO2) * 0.9% Diarsenic Trioxide (As2O3) Plus additional oxides and colorants depending on the product line being produced. When initially released in Europe, and during the Le CLAIR test marketing period in the US, many Visions products shipped with a \\"flat-top\\" lid that was also made of Calexium. These lids could be flipped over and used as a skillet or baking pan. However, upon official introduction in the US, releases under the Visions brand made use of knob- style glass lids made of Pyrex. Glass lids are now standard worldwide.  Related products  Corelle Brands sells similar functioning cookware under the CorningWare StoveTop brand name. These products are made of opaque Pyroceram ceramic-glass, like vintage pieces of Corning Ware, and can be used in the similar ways as Visions cookware. They are currently manufactured in France by the same factory that produces Visions. Pyrex, a brand name for break-resistant glass bakeware, has offered complementary amber (Fireside) and Cranberry tinted lines to match Visions colorways in the past. Care must be made to distinguish between Visions and bakeware marketed under the Pyrex brand name, as the thermal properties of each product are quite different. Calexium, the transparent version of Pyroceram used to make Visions, is also used in other products such as ceramic-glass top stoves and fireplace doors.  References  Corning Inc.

Life  Joachim Meyerhoff is the youngest son of Hermann Meyerhoff, who was the director of the psychiatric clinic in Hesterberg, Schleswig-Holstein, since 1972. The director's house was on the grounds of the clinic. Joachim spent his childhood with two older brothers on the clinic grounds in Schleswig-Holstein. At 17, he spent a year in Laramie, Wyoming. During this time, his middle brother was killed in an automobile accident. After his return, Joachim Meyerhoff completed his high school studies (Abitur) and would have performed his compulsory community service as a swimming-pool supervisor at the Rechts der Isar Hospital in Munich. Instead, he completed his training as an actor between 1989 and 1992 at the Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts in Munich. After commitments at the Staatstheater Kassel, in Bielefeld, Dortmund and the B√ºhnen der Stadt K√∂ln, he joined the Maxim Gorki Theater, Berlin in 2001, where he also frequently directed. In 2002, he moved to the Deutsche Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, where he stayed until 2005. He acted there in productions by Volker Hesse, Thomas Langhoff, Stefan Otteni, Karin Beier, Sebastian Hartmann and G√ºnter Kr√§mer. Since September 2005, Joachim Meyerhoff has been an ensemble member of the Burgtheater in Vienna. At the beginning of the 2013 season, he returned to the Deutsche Schauspielhaus under the leadership of artistic director Karin Beier. However, he remains a member of the Viennese Burgtheater.

His project Alle Toten fliegen hoch regularly played at the Burgtheater Vienna to a full audience.‚ÄûAlle Toten fliegen hoch‚Äú, Burgtheater Wien, 2012 In this autobiographical, six-part program, Meyerhoff tells the story of his life and family. He tells of his siblings, his grandparents in Munich, his father, the director of a child and youth psychiatric clinic in Schleswig, his upbringing on the grounds on the institution, and his exchange year in America. He was invited to perform the first three parts of the series at the Berliner Theatertreffen 2009. In 2011, the first part (Amerika) was published as a book by Kiepenheuer & Witsch. In 2006 and 2007, Meyerhoff was nominated for the Nestroy-Preis. He was chosen as Actor of the Year in 2007 for playing the role of Hamlet at the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich and the role of Benedict in Jan Bosse's production of Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing. He received the 2011 Franz-Tumler-Literaturpreis and the 2012 advancement award of the Bremer Literaturpreis for his novel Alle Toten fliegen hoch. Amerika. In 2014, he was recognized for his work in the role of Arnolphe in The School for Wives (Schauspielhaus Hamburg, producer: Herbert Fritsch) with the Rolf-Mares-Preis. In 2015, his interpretation of Kreon in Jette Steckel's production of Antigone at the Burgtheater was praised by the public and press.

It was developed by Do My Best Games and published by tinyBuild, and released on August 30, 2016 for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Xbox One, and September 2, 2016 for PlayStation 4. The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised its originality and world-building but criticized its linearity. DLC titled The Only Traitor was released on April 19, 2017, featuring a new main character and taking place concurrently with the events of the main story.  Gameplay  The Final Station consists of two types of gameplay. The first is the inside of the train part of the game where the player must balance taking care of survivors that they have rescued by feeding them or healing them and taking care of the train by completing small mini games to keep the experimental train running until they reach the next train station. The second part of the game is the in game combat that happens at most train stations. In the game, the player will explore a side scrolling level with an apocalyptic theme that requires a strategic plan to complete. A player must decide on what resources to use and risk, such as melee combat, shooting an enemy and using their small amount of ammunition, using the environment to deal with enemies or trying to run past and avoid the enemies. There are varying types of enemies, making the levels and strategies needed harder. The player will need to find a hidden code at each station to get the train moving again and also find resources such as ammo, food and survivors.  Plot  The player takes the role of a conductor named Edward Jones, who is working as a train operator 106 years after a catastrophe dubbed \\"The First Visitation\\". One day, the Conductor is tasked with taking an experimental train to pick up a special cargo. However, during the journey, the Conductor quickly discovers that he is in the midst of \\"The Second Visitation\\", as cities and towns are attacked by an unknown force, and their inhabitants are transformed into aggressive monsters by some unknown infection. Eventually, the Conductor picks up the power source and central processor for the Guardian, a massive war machine being built to protect humanity from the Second Visitation. The Conductor finally reaches the city of Metropole where the Guardian is being built and delivers the cargo. On the way home, the Conductor picks up a mysterious stranger who rides with him and speaks with him in cryptic clues. He reveals to the Conductor that the infection that is transforming people into monsters is not a virus, but a medicine that was meant to make people stronger, and that the radiation the train's engine is generating is protecting the Conductor from its effects. Shortly after, the train breaks down, forcing the Conductor to make the rest of the journey on foot. Along the way, he passes the destroyed wreck of the Guardian. When he finally reaches his hometown, he discovers that the people who are apparently immune to the infection are already rebuilding society, but he himself is showing symptoms of infection. The Conductor manages to reach his home but succumbs to the infection before he can see his daughter. The mysterious stranger then arrives and promises to look after the Conductor's daughter before mercifully killing him.  Development  The Final Station was in development for 2.5 years before being released as a full game in 2016, and was Do My Best Games's first game release. TinyBuild is the publisher/co- developer. TinyBuild morphed part of their studio to port third-party indie projects to consoles alongside their development. This way, they could concentrate on a single large release. Do My Best Games started with a small prototype, which was produced relatively quickly. However, a couple of very important mechanics were missing from this prototype. Because of this, they had to make a lot of changes. The next step was the creation of a demo which featured all the mechanics. This version of the game was given to press and publishers. After this step did they start to build the game levels and other content.  Reception  The Final Station received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 76/100 on Metacritic for the PC version. Stephen Turner of Destructoid rated the game 80/100, calling it a \\"contemplative slice of sci-fi horror\\" and comparing it to Snowpiercer and Evangelion. Alex Gilyadov of GameSpot rated the game 7/10, saying it had a \\"fast-paced mix of action and strategy\\" with a \\"compelling twist\\", but criticized it for being \\"predictable\\" with \\"lackluster dialogue\\". Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the game \\"simple, but just compelling enough\\".

He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the 1991 murder of a sixteen-year-old, Krystal Naab, in Ramsey, Illinois. The case against Heaton was largely circumstantial, except for a semen sample found on the victim. DNA profiling that was conducted and presented at the trial as evidence against Heaton was disputed by some scientists. In 2001 another DNA test was performed which proved 1 billion to 1 accuracy that Heaton was the killer. Murder On the afternoon of July 23, 1991, sixteen-year-old Krystal Naab was found murdered in her parent's mobile home in Ramsey, Illinois; she had been stabbed 81 times with a pair of sewing scissors. An autopsy revealed that Naab was three months pregnant. Questioning of the victim's brother led police to a carpenter named Stuart Heaton. He was subsequently arrested; he had cuts on his hands. In addition, witnesses claimed to have seen a white pickup truck at the Naab residence on the day Krystal was murdered, the same type of vehicle that was owned by Heaton. He was indicted on two counts of first-degree murder by the grand jury of St. Libory il.. Menard Correctional Center in Chester, Illinois, where Heaton is serving his life sentence Conviction Heaton was put on trial in 1992. DNA testing of the semen sample taken from Naab's body, conducted by Dr. Robert Allen, was compared to the DNA of Heaton, concluding that it was a match, and that the chances of the DNA matching a white male other than Heaton were 1 in 52,600. There was no other physical evidence at the crime scene that could be linked to Heaton. The DNA evidence, along with circumstantial evidence, ultimately convicted Heaton of Krystal Naab's murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. However, the DNA testing was disputed by some, including the defense expert at Heaton's trial, Dr. Gary Litman, who said it was the \\"worst quality DNA work I've seen done.\\" Analysis of the DNA evidence by Dr. Dan E. Krane was inconclusive on whether the semen belonged to Heaton, and that the case could be made that someone else committed the murder. Another expert in the field, Dr. Thomas Marr, also criticized the work of Allen due to mistakes made during the DNA testing. In 1997, Heaton's request to have his conviction overturned was denied. In July 2001, Heaton was granted a new round of DNA testing by a Fayette County judge. In 2001, new DNA testing was performed unequivocally proving that Heaton was, in fact, the murderer. However, there are still some who support him and maintain his innocence. In the media Heaton's case was featured on several television programs, including Unsolved Mysteries and The Investigators.
