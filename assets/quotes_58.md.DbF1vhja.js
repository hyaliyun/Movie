Muzaffar was held captive at Agra. He appointed his foster brother M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh as the first viceroy who faced an insurrection by the rebel nobles of the former Sultanate. Akbar quickly came to aid and ended the insurrection. He soon appointed M√≠rza Kh√°n who managed to set revenue system and quelled attack by the Mirzas with help of Mughal minister Todar Mal. The next viceroy Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n strengthened the military. Soon Sultan Muzaffar escaped, returned to Gujarat and led an attack on Ahmedabad and recaptured it before his former noble and now viceroy Itimad Khan reach the city. Soon Mirza Khan was reappointed as the viceroy who defeated Muzaffar in the battle of Fatehwadi in 1584. Soon Kokalt√°sh returned as the viceroy and defeated Muzaffar and combined Kathiawad forces in battle of Bhuchar Mori. Later Muzaffar was captured but he committed suicide, putting an end to the Gujarat Sultanate. As Kokalt√°sh went to the Mecca on pilgrimage, Sultan Murad Bakhsh was appointed as the viceroy on whose death, Kokalt√°sh returned third time as the viceroy. Akbar was succeeded by Jehangir. Background The last two Gujarat Sultans, Ahmad Shah III and Mahmud Shah III, were raised to throne when they were young. So the nobles were had decided to carry on the government under one noble as a regent of the Sultan and they further divided the country among themselves. But the nobles had their own aspirations so started looking for opportunity to expand their territories with intention of the supremacy. On one such occasion, the noble named √çtim√°d Kh√°n requested help from the Mughal Emperor Akbar who promptly agreed to help. Early in July 1572, he invaded Gujarat. He first captured Disa and then Patan and appointed a governor. The most Gujarat nobles soon surrendered to him and the rebel nobles fled to other parts of Gujarat. Akbar reached Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat Sultanate. He advanced to Cambay and later the Mirzas controlling southern Gujarat were defeated and Bharuch and Surat was captured. Viceroys under Akbar (1573‚Äì1605) Mirza √Çz√≠z Kokaltash, First Viceroy, 1573‚Äì1575 During his conquest, on leaving Khambaht to expel the M√≠rzas, Akbar appointed his general and foster brother M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh as his first viceroy of Gujar√°t. He placed Surat in the charge of Kal√≠j Kh√°n. Muhammad Kh√°n; son of Sher Kh√°n Faul√°di, the noble who previously held Patan; who had fled to the Idar hills, now returned and took the city of P√°tan, besieging the Mughal governor, Sayad √Åhmed Kh√°n B√°rha, in the citadel. At this time another noble M√≠rza Muhammad Husain was at Ranpur near Dhandhuka. When Sher Kh√°n Faul√°di, who had taken refuge in Sorath, heard of Muhammad Kh√°n's return to P√°tan, he met M√≠rza Muhammad Husain, and uniting their forces they joined Muhammad Kh√°n at P√°tan. The viceroy M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh with other nobles marched against them, and after a hard-fought battle, in which several of the imperial nobles were slain, M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh was victorious. Sher Kh√°n again took refuge in Sorath, and his son fled for safety to the √çdar hills, while the M√≠rza withdrew to the Khandesh frontier. As the conquest of Gujar√°t was completed in 1573, Akbar returned to Agra. Before leaving Gujar√°t Akbar placed the charge of the province in the hands of M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh. At the same time the emperor rewarded his supporters by grants of land, assigning Ahmedabad with Petlad and several other districts to the viceroy M√≠rza √Çz√≠z, P√°tan to the Kh√°n-i-Kal√°n M√≠r Muhammad Kh√°n, and Baroda to Naw√°b Aurang Kh√°n. Bharuch was given to Kutb-ud-d√≠n Muhammad, and Dholka Kh√°npur and Sami were confirmed to Sayad H√°mid and Sayad Mahm√∫d Bukh√°ri. As soon as the emperor Akbar left, Ikhtiy√°r-ul-Mulk and Muhammad Kh√°n, son of Sher Kh√°n, who had taken shelter in the √çdar hills, issued forth, and the viceroy marched to Ahmednagar (now Himatnagar) to hold them in check. M√≠rza Muhammad Husain advancing rapidly from the Nandurbar frontier, took the fort of Bharuch, and went then to Cambay (now Khambhat) which he found abandoned by its governor Husain Kh√°n Karkar√°h, while he himself marched to Ahmednagar and √çdar against Ikhtiy√°r-ul-Mulk. The viceroy ordered Sayad H√°mid Bukh√°ri, Naw√°b Naurang Kh√°n, and others to join Kutb-ud-d√≠n Muhammad Kh√°n. They went and laid siege to Cambay, but M√≠rza Muhammad managed to evacuate the town and join Ikhtiy√°r-ul-Mulk and Muhammad Kh√°n. ;Insurrection Quelled by Akbar, 1573 The Battle between the Mughal Army and Muhammad Husain Mirza near Ahmadabad, 1573, Akbarnama After several unsuccessful attempts to scatter the enemy, the viceroy retired to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and the rebels laid siege to the city. Kutb-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, Sayad M√≠r√°n, and others of the Mughal party succeeded in entering the city and joining the garrison. After the siege had lasted two months, Akbar, making his famous 600 mile (400 kos) march in nine days from Agra, arrived before √Åhmed√°b√°d, and, at once engaging the enemy, totally defeated them with the loss of two of their leaders M√≠rza Muhammad Husain and Ikhtiy√°r-ul-Mulk. On the day before the battle Akbar consulting a Haz√°ra Afgh√°n versed in drawing omens from sheep's shoulder-blades, was told that victory was certain, but that it would be won at the cost of the life of one of his nobles. Seif Kh√°n, brother of Zein Kh√°n Koka, coming in prayed that he should be chosen to receive the crown of martyrdom. At the end of the day the only leading noble that was killed was Seif Kh√°n. After only eleven days' stay, Akbar again entrusting the government of Gujar√°t to M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Koka, returned to Agra. M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Koka did not long continue viceroy. In 1575, in consequence of some dispute with the emperor, he retired into private life. M√≠rza Kh√°n, Second Viceroy, 1575‚Äì1577 On his resignation, Akbar conferred the post of viceroy on M√≠rza Kh√°n, son of Behr√°m Kh√°n, who afterwards rose to the high rank of Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n or chief of the nobles. As this was M√≠rza Kh√°n's first service, and as he was still a youth, he was ordered to follow the advice of the deputy viceroy, Waz√≠r Kh√°n, in whose hands the administration of the province remained during the two following years. ;Survey by R√°ja Todar Mal. Soon after the insurrection of 1573 was suppressed the emperor sent his minister R√°ja Todar Mal to make a survey settlement of the province. In 1575 after the survey was completed Waj√≠h-ul-Mulk Gujar√°ti was appointed d√≠w√°n or minister. Some historians say that in 1576 Waz√≠r Kh√°n relieved M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Koka as viceroy, but according to the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi Mirza Kh√°n held office with Waz√≠r Kh√°n as his deputy. One Pr√°gd√°s, a Hindu, succeeded Waj√≠h-ul-Mulk as d√≠w√°n. Troops were sent to reduce the N√°ndod and √çdar districts, and the fort of Sirohi was captured by Tarsu Kh√°n, the military governor of P√°tan. Afterwards, through the intervention of Pah√°r Kh√°n J√°lori, the Sirohi R√°ja, at an interview with R√°ja Todar Mal, presented Rupees 12,000 and other articles and was allowed to serve the provincial governor of Gujar√°t with 1500 horse. During Waz√≠r Kh√°n's administration Muzaffar Husain M√≠rza, son of Ibr√°h√≠m Husain M√≠rza, raised an insurrection in Gujar√°t. This M√≠rza Muzaffar was as an infant carried to the Dakhan (Deccan) from Surat shortly before its capture by Akbar. He lived peacefully till under the influence of an ambitious retainer Mihr Ali by name, he gathered an army and entered Nandurbar. Waz√≠r Kh√°n distrusting his troops shut himself in a fortress, and wrote to R√°ja Todar Mal, who was in P√°tan settling revenue affairs. The M√≠rza defeated the Mughal forces in Nandurb√°r and failing to get possession of Cambay (now Khambhat) marched straight to √Åhmed√°b√°d. On the advance of R√°ja Todar Mal, the M√≠rza fell back on Dholka. The R√°ja and the Kh√°n pursuing defeated him, and he retired to Junagadh. The R√°ja then withdrew, but the M√≠rza again advanced and besieged him in √Åhmed√°b√°d. In an attempt to escalade the city wall, Mihr Ali was killed. Muzaffar M√≠rza withdrew to Kh√°ndesh and the insurrection came to an end. Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n, Third Viceroy, 1577‚Äì1583 In the end of 1577, as Waz√≠r Kh√°n's management was not successful, the post of viceroy was conferred upon Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n √Åhmed Kh√°n, the governor of Malwa. Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n's first step was to create new military posts and strengthen the old ones. ;Sends a Force against Jun√°ga·∏çh At this time Fateh Kh√°n Shirw√°ni, the commander of Am√≠n Kh√°n Ghori's army, quarrelled with his chief, and, coming to Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n, offered to capture the fort of Junagadh. Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n entertained his proposal, and sent his nephew M√≠rza Kh√°n and 4000 horse with him. When the troops crossed the Sorath frontier, they were met by envoys from Am√≠n Kh√°n, agreeing, in his name, to pay tribute and surrender the country, provided he were permitted to retain the fortress of Jun√°ga·∏çh and were allotted a sufficient grant of land. M√≠rza Kh√°n rejected these proposals and continued his march against Jun√°ga·∏çh. Am√≠n Kh√°n made a vigorous resistance and applied for aid to the J√°m of Nawanagar State. At this juncture Fateh Kh√°n died, and M√≠rza Kh√°n went and besieged Mangrol. The J√°m's minister Is√° now joined Am√≠n Kh√°n with 4000 horse, and he, quitting Jun√°ga·∏çh, marched to Mangrol. On their approach M√≠rza Kh√°n retired to the town of Kodinar followed by Am√≠n Kh√°n. Here a pitched battle was fought, and M√≠rza Kh√°n was defeated with the loss of his baggage. Many of his men were slain, and he himself, being wounded, escaped with difficulty to √Åhmed√°b√°d. Shah√°b ud-d√≠n, who had meanwhile been giving his attention to revenue matters, and to the more correct measurement of the lands of the province, was rudely recalled from these peaceful occupations by his nephew's defeat. ;Muzaffar Shah III returns Gujarat During the same time, the former Gujarat Sultan, Muzaffar Shah III escaped to Gujarat from his imprisonment in Agra in 1583. Muzaffar remained for some time in the Rajpipla country, and then came to one L√∫na or L√∫mbha K√°thi, at the village of Kh√≠ri in the district of Sardh√°r in Sorath. √çtim√°d Kh√°n Gujar√°ti, Fourth Viceroy, 1583‚Äì84 √çtim√°d Kh√°n Gujar√°ti was appointed viceroy by Akbar soon in 1583 in place of Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n. At this time a party of 700 or 800 Mughals, called Waz√≠r Kh√°nis, separating from Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n, remained behind in hope of being entertained by the new viceroy. As √çtim√°d Kh√°n declared that he was unable to take them into his service, they went off in a body and joined Muzaffar at Kh√≠ri, and he with them and three or four thousand K√°thi horse marched at once on √Åhmed√°b√°d. On hearing this √çtim√°d Kh√°n, leaving his son Sher Kh√°n in √Åhmed√°b√°d, followed Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n to Kadi, and entreated him to return. Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n at first affected indifference telling √çtim√°d that as he had given over charge he had no more interest in the province. After two days, he consented to return if √çtim√°d stated in writing that the country was on the verge of being lost and that √çtim√°d being unable to hold it was obliged to relinquish charge to Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n. √çtim√°d Kh√°n made the required statement and Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n returned with him. ;Muzaffar captures √Åhmed√°b√°d, 1583 Meanwhile, Muzaffar Sh√°h reached √Åhmed√°b√°d, which was weakly defended, and in 1583, after a brief struggle, took possession of the city. While the siege of √Åhmed√°b√°d was in progress, Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n and √çtim√°d Kh√°n were returning, and were within a few miles of the city, when news of its capture reached them. They continued their advance, but had barely arrived at √Åhmed√°b√°d when Muzaffar Sh√°h totally defeated them taking all their baggage. Seeing the issue of the fight, most of their army went over to Muzaffar Sh√°h III, and the viceroy and Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n with a few men fled to P√°tan. Kutb-ud-d√≠n Muhammad Kh√°n Atkah, one of the Mughal commanders, who was on the Kh√°ndesh frontier, now advanced by forced marches to Baroda. Muzaffar marched against him with a large army, recently strengthened by the union of the army of Sayad Daul√°t, ruler of Cambay. Kutb-ud-d√≠n threw himself into Baroda, and, in spite of the treachery of his troops, defended the city for some time. At last, on Muzaffar's assurance that his life should be spared Kutb-ud-d√≠n repaired to the enemies' camp to treat for peace. On his arrival, he was treated with respect, but next day was treacherously put to death. The fort of Bharuch was also at this time traitorously surrendered to Muzaffar by the slaves of the mother of Naurang Kh√°n, fief-holder of the district. M√≠rza Abd√∫r-Rah√≠m Kh√°n (Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n), Fifth Viceroy, 1583‚Äì1587 ;Battle of Fatehwadi On learning of the Gujar√°t insurrection, the emperor Akbar, at the close of 1583, conferred the government of the province on M√≠rza Abd√∫r-Rah√≠m Kh√°n, son of Behr√°m Kh√°n, who had formerly (1575) acted as viceroy. Muzaffar, who was still at Broach, hearing of the advance of the new viceroy with a large army, returned rapidly to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and in 1584 fought a pitched battle with M√≠rza Abd√∫r-Rah√≠m Kh√°n between Sarkhej and Sh√°h Bh√≠kan's tomb. In this engagement Muzaffar was entirely defeated, and fled to Cambay (Khambhat) pursued by M√≠rza Abd√∫r-Rah√≠m Kh√°n. Muzaffar now hearing that M√≠rza Abd√∫r-Rah√≠m Kh√°n had been joined by Naurang Kh√°n and other nobles with the Mughal army from M√°lwa, quitted Cambay, and made for his old place of shelter in Rajpipla. Finding no rest in R√°jp√≠pla, after fighting and losing another battle in the R√°jp√≠pla hills, he fled first to P√°tan and then to √çdar, and afterwards again repaired to L√∫mbha K√°thi in Khiri. In reward for these two victories, the emperor bestowed on M√≠rza Abd√∫r-Rah√≠m Kh√°n the title of Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n. Bharuch now submitted, and Muzaffar sought shelter with Am√≠n Kh√°n Ghori at Junagadh, by whom he was allotted the town of Gondal as a residence. Muzaffar made one more attempt to establish his power. He advanced to Morbi, and thence made a raid on Radhanpur and plundered that town, but was soon compelled to return to Kathiawad and seek safety in flight. Am√≠n Kh√°n, seeing that his cause was hopeless, on pretence of aiding him, induced Muzaffar to give him some money, two lakh Mahmudi. When he had obtained the money, on one pretext or another, Am√≠n Kh√°n withheld the promised aid. The Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n now marched an army into Sorath against Muzaffar. The J√°m of Nav√°nagar and Am√≠n Kh√°n sent their envoys to meet the viceroy, declaring that they had not sheltered Muzaffar, and that he was leading an outlaw's life, entirely unaided by them. The viceroy agreed not to molest them, on condition that they withheld aid and shelter from Muzaffar, and himself marched against him. When he reached Upleta, about fifteen miles north-west of the fortress of Jun√°ga·∏çh, the viceroy heard that Muzaffar had sought shelter in the Barda hills in the south-west corner of the Kathiawar peninsula. Advancing to the hills, he halted his main force outside of the rough country and sent skirmishing parties to examine the hills. Muzaffar had already passed through Nav√°nagar and across Gujar√°t to Danta in the Mahi Kantha. Here he was once more defeated by the Prantij garrison, and a third time took refuge in R√°jp√≠pla. The viceroy now marched on Nav√°nagar to punish the J√°m. The J√°m sent in his submission, and the viceroy taking from him, by way of fine, an elephant and some valuable horses, returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. He next sent a detachment against Ghazni Kh√°n of Jalore who had favoured Muzaffar. Ghazni Kh√°n submitted, and no further steps were taken against him. Ism√°√≠l Kuli Kh√°n, Sixth Viceroy, 1587‚Äì88 and M√≠rza √Çziz Kokalt√°sh, Seventh Viceroy, 1588‚Äì1592 ;Battle of Bhuchar Mori In 1587, the Kh√°n Kh√°n√°n was replaced by Ism√°√≠l Kuli Kh√°n as a governor. Ism√°√≠l's government lasted only for a few months, when he was superseded by M√≠rza √Çziz Kokalt√°sh, who was a second time appointed viceroy. In 1591, Muzaffar again returned to Sorath. The viceroy, hearing that he had been joined by the J√°m of Nawanagar State, the Cutch State chief, and Daulat Kh√°n Ghori the son of Am√≠n Kh√°n, marched with a large army towards Sorath, and, halting at Viramgam, sent forward a detachment under Naurang Kh√°n, Sayad K√°sim, and other officers. Advancing as far as Morbi, Naurang Kh√°n entered into negotiations with the J√°m, who, however, refused to accede to the demands of the imperial commander. On this the viceroy joined Naurang Kh√°n with the bulk of his army, and after a short delay marched on Naw√°nagar. On his way, at a plateau called Bhuchar Mori at the village of Dhrol near Naw√°nagar, Muzaffar and the J√°m opposed him, and an obstinate battle in which the imperialists were nearly worsted, ended in Muzaffar's defeat. The son and minister of the J√°m were slain, and Muzaffar, the J√°m, and Daulat Kh√°n who was wounded, fled to the fortress of Jun√°ga·∏çh. The viceroy now advanced and plundered Naw√°nagar, and remaining there sent Naurang Kh√°n, Sayad K√°s√≠m, and G√∫jar Kh√°n against Jun√°ga·∏çh. The day the army arrived before the fortress Daulat Kh√°n died of his wounds. Still the fortress held out, and though the viceroy joined them the siege made little progress as the imperial troops were in great straits for grain. The viceroy returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and after seven or eight months again marched against Jun√°ga·∏çh. The J√°m, who was still a fugitive, sent envoys and promised to aid the viceroy if his country were restored to him. The viceroy assented on condition that, during the operations against Jun√°ga·∏çh, the J√°m should furnish his army with grain. The J√°m agreed to provide grain, and after a siege of three months the garrison surrendered. ;Muzaffar Shah III's last days News was next received that Muzaffar had taken refuge at Dwarka (also known as Jagat). The viceroy at once sent Naurang Kh√°n and others with an army in pursuit. On reaching Jagat it was found that Muzaffar had already left for a village owned by a R√°jput named Sewa W√°dhel. Without halting Naurang Kh√°n started in pursuit, nearly surprising Muzaffar, who escaping on horseback with a few followers, crossed to Cutch (now Kachchh). Sewa W√°dhel covering Muzaffar's retreat was surprised before he could put to sea and fought gallantly with the imperial forces till he was slain. Naurang Kh√°n then came to Ar√°mra, a village belonging to Singr√°m W√°dhel, R√°ja of Dwarka, and after frustrating a scheme devised by that chief to entrap a body of the troops on board ship under pretence of pursuing Muzaffar's family, led his men back to Jun√°ga·∏çh. The viceroy, hearing in what direction Muzaffar had fled, marched to Morbi, where the J√°m of Nav√°nagar came and paid his respects. At the same time the Cutch chief, who is called Rao Bh√°ramalji I, sent a message that if the viceroy would refrain from invading his country and would give him his ancestral district of Morbi and supply him with a detachment of troops, he would point out where Muzaffar was concealed. The Kh√°n-i-√Åzam agreed to these terms and the chief captured Muzaffar and handed him to the force sent to secure him. The detachment, strictly guarding the prisoner, were marching rapidly towards Morbi, when, on reaching Dhrol, about thirty miles east of Nawanagar (now Jamnagar), under pretence of obeying a call of nature, Muzaffar withdrew and cut his throat with a knief, so that he died. This happened in 1592. The viceroy sent Muzaffar's head to court of Akbar. The viceroy was now recalled by Akbar, he delayed on pretence of wishing to humble the Portuguese. His real object was to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, and in 1592, after obtaining the necessary permission from the Portuguese, he started from Veraval. During this viceroyalty, an imperial farm√°n ordered that the state share of the produce should be one-half and the other half should be left to the cultivator and further that from each half five per cent should be deducted for the village headmen. All other taxes were declared illegal, and it was provided that when lands or houses were sold, half the government demand should be realized from the seller and half from the buyer. Sult√°n Mur√°d Baksh Eighth Viceroy, 1592‚Äì1600 The emperor, who was much vexed to hear of the departure of the viceroy, appointed prince Sult√°n Murad Bakhsh in his stead with as his minister Muhammad S√°dikkh√°n one of the great nobles. In 1593‚Äì94 M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh returned from his pilgrimage and repaired to court, and next year on prince Mur√°d Bakhsh going to the Dakhan (Deccan), S√∫rajsingh was appointed his deputy. In 1594‚Äì95 Bah√°dur, son of the late Muzaffar Sh√°h III, excited a rebellion, but was defeated by S√∫rajsingh. M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh, Ninth Viceroy, 1600‚Äì1606 In 1600, owing to the death of Sult√°n Mur√°d, M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh was a third time appointed viceroy of Gujar√°t, and he sent Shams-ud-d√≠n Husain as his deputy to √Åhmed√°b√°d. Further changes were made in 1602 when M√≠rza √Çz√≠z sent his eldest son Sh√°dm√°n as deputy; his second son Khurram as governor of Junaga·∏çh; and Sayad B√°yaz√≠d as minister. Khurram was afterwards relieved of the charge of Sorath and Junaga·∏çh by his brother Abdull√°h. Jehangir succeeded Akbar to the Mughal throne in 1605 when he died.

Some of her works appeared under the pseudonyms \\"Bob\\" or \\"Bob B√©ol\\". She is, in addition, known to scholars of literature on account of her relationship with Arthur Schnitzler whose life partner she became between 1923 and his death in 1931.  Life  Clara Loeb was born into a culturally aware family of intellectual secular Jews in Vienna, where she grew up along with her two brothers, Alfred and Otto, and her sister, Anna. (It is believed that she took to using the middle name, \\"Katharina\\", only after she was eighteen.) Her grandfather had been a textiles magnate who clothed the Habsburg armies during the Napoleonic Wars. Her father, Louis Loeb/L√∂b (1843‚Äì1928), was a banker. The family were prosperous and while she was growing up there were frequent family holidays in Bad Ischl., Gifted and intensively educated, when Clara was 19 she began to write, using male pseudonyms when publishing her work. In April 1897 \\"Mimi: Silhouettes from a girl's life\\" (\\" Mimi. Schattenbilder aus einem M√§dchenleben\\") appeared in the literary journal Neue Deutsche Zeitschrift, attributed to a writer using the pseudonym \\"Bob\\", and incorporating a prologue by Hugo von Hofmannsthal. Mimi was presented as a female counterpart to Arthur Schnitzler's character, Anatol. Mimi was seen as a great success. At the heart of the tale is a shy girl who becomes a self- assured woman, keen to enjoy life, and critical of her parents when they try to select a husband for her. One scene features the protagonist in an \\"amorous skirmish with a writer on a rowing boat, out at night on the Millst√§tter See\\". Publication of Mimi in the literary journal triggered ructions within the family and Hugo von Hofmannsthal was called upon to intervene with the publishers S. Fischer Verlag in order to prevent it from being published as a book. Despite the rebellious tendencies evidenced in \\"Mimi\\", Clara submitted to her parents' wishes when she gave up writing and married at the Seitenstettengasse Temple (synagogue) on 10 May 1898. Her husband, Otto Pollaczek, was heir to the largest wholesaler of leather hides in the Habsburg Monarchy. Their sons, Hermann and Karl Friedrich, were born in 1899 and 1902. The family lived in their own house alongside the Blumauergasse (street) in the city's second district. The marriage seems not to have been particularly happy: Pollaczek turned out to be unfaithful as a husband and during Clara's second pregnancy he took his mistress along for a summer vacation. The business found itself in financial difficulties during 1907 and after it failed, Otto Pollaczek took his own life on 17 April 1908. Clara was no longer able to live in the home they had shared, and was left with a no income and very few assets. Her financial position deteriorated further after the First World War because she had invested in War bonds. She had to sell her jewelry and leave her parents' home to which she had returned in 1918 after her mother died. The house was rented out and eventually, in 1928, sold. For a time she lived in a hotel, before moving into a small apartment in the eighteenth district, to the west of the university. In order to support the family, in 1924 she returned to writing, also working as a translator. During the 1920s and 1930s she published stories, novellas and poems in the prestigious Neue Freie Presse (daily newspaper), as well as several serially published novels.Stephan Kurz: Kommentierte Bibliographie zu Clara Katharina Pollaczek, in: ‚ÄûA. ist manchmal wie ein kleines Kind‚Äú. Clara Katharina Pollaczek und Arthur Schnitzler gehen ins Kino. Hrsg. v. Stephan Kurz und Michael Rohrwasser. B√∂hlau, Wien 2010, p. 35 ff. She acquired a large number of committed readers. Austria was subsumed into Germany in 1938. Germany had been governed by Nazis since 1933, according to the twin tenets of populism through the ages: hope and hatred. The hatred was focused on Communists and Jews, and took increasingly sinister and destructive forms. Clara Katharina Pollaczek was subject to antisemitic persecution. She may have owed her survival to her possession of a Czechoslovak passport, acquired as a result of the marriage to Pollaczek. Two days after German troops were welcomed by cheering crowds into Vienna marking Austria's incorporation into Nazi Germany, she crossed to Prague where she lived for a while. When, in 1939, the Germans completed their occupation of Czechoslovakia, she was visiting friends in Switzerland. She stayed in Switzerland, receiving financial support from relatives, till war ended in 1945. During this period she became a Roman Catholic. (The last practicing Jew in her family had been her grandfather.) In 1945 she joined her son Karl who had ended up in Gillingham in England, but he was married with children: the home was cramped and, unlike her younger son, Clara did not feel settled in England. It was her brother, the lawyer Otto Loeb, who organised her return to Vienna in 1948. It proved impossible to resume her literary career. Literary contacts with whom she had worked before 1938 were dead or had emigrated permanently. Three years later, in 1951, she died after a long illness which, following her demise, was found to have been hitherto undiagnosed cancer. Her death notice appeared in the Neue Freie Presse of 25 July 1951. On 26 July 1951 her body was buried among those of other honoured citizens of the city in the Sieveringer interdenominational cemetery.  Family tragedies and dispersals  Clara's elder son, Hermann, emigrated via Hamburg to Argentina in 1931. Her younger son, Karl, qualified as a physician. He was captured by the Gestapo but released. With his wife and daughter, on 20 June 1938 he fled to Switzerland, from where he made his way to Great Britain where he changed his name to Kary Pole. He produced an autobiography in 1982, entitled \\"Two halves of a Life\\".K.F. M. (Kary Frederick Michael) Pole: Two Halves Of A Life. The autobiography of a Viennese doctor who escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria and built up a new life and medical career in England, Meresborough Books, Gillingham 1982 The book describes his mother's life as an exile in England during the Second World War. According to the same book, his aunt, Clara's sister Anna, also pursued a literary career, but with less success than Clara. Anna was murdered at Theresienstadt. His uncle, Clara's brother Otto Loeb, became a lawyer and remained in Vienna. He survived the Nazi years, possibly because of a distinguished record of military service during the First World War. He was authorized to practice law as a \\"counsellor and legal advisor for Jews\\" (\\"Konsulent, zugelassen zur rechtlichen Beratung von Juden\\"). Clara's other brother, Alfred, became an artist and member of the Hagenbund. According to a 1939 lexicon he was, at that time, living in London. He died \\"in a monastery\\" in 1945.  Arthur Schnitzler  Clara Loeb met Arthur Schnitzler at the end of 1896 during a New Year's Eve party held at her parents' house. Guests included leading artistic and literary figures of the time. She met Hugo von Hofmannsthal at the same event. Both men encouraged her to pursue her literary ambitions. Schnitzler later mentioned her in his diary as \\"the dear little girl with big eyes\\" (\\"das liebe kleine M√§del mit gro√üen Augen\\"). They embarked upon a correspondence that lasted till Clara's marriage in 1898. In their letters they discussed literary issues. They met up frequently at family gatherings. They wrote of arranging to meet up in \\"nervous encounters\\" (\\"nerv√∂se Zusammenk√ºnfte\\"), although it is not clear whether or not they ever, at this point, met up except within the wider context of social events. Clara's parents disapproved of her fiendship with Schnitzler, and of friendships with other men, and hastened to arrange her marriage with Pollaczek. During Clara's marriage the correspondence with Schnitzler was broken off. The death of her husband in 1908 left Clara Katharina Pollaczek feeling liberated, according to her son's book. She had several male friendships before entering into a closer relationship with Schnitzler. Schnitzler's diaries disclose an exchange of letters, regular encounters, and even one telephone conversation from approximately 1915. After Schnitzler was divorced from Olga Gussmann, which took place in 1921, he and Pollaczek met one another far more frequently. There were theatre and museum visits and walks together in the city's parks. They also later travelled together, and frequently visited the cinema. At this time a sexual relationship outside marriage would have been taboo for a woman. That was one convention that Clara Pollaczek disregarded. She was 48 and Arthur Schnitzler 61, and suffering from Melancholia, when they became, for most purposes, life- partners. Between 1923 and Schnitzler's death in 1931, they were a couple. However, they did not actually live together and there is no evidence that either of them ever contemplated marriage. After her husband's death in 1908, literary endeavour became a financial necessity for Pollaczek. She was permanently short of money, but did not wish to allow Schnitzler to provide her with financial support. In 1924 he gave her a typewriter for Christmas. He read almost everything she wrote and she also became a critic of his work, whose judgement and suggestions he valued. Meanwhile Arthur Schnitzler had a number of other affairs which he tried to conceal from Pollaczek, and also remained in regular touch with his ex-wife and Lili, his daughter. Clara Katharina Pollaczek frequently complained that she was not sufficiently seen out with Schnitzler \\"in society\\", and was not identified as his \\"official mistress\\". Their relationship became increasingly defined by conflict‚Äîfor instance, when Clara Pollaczek announced that she was anti-semitic. As Schnitzler recorded the exchange in his diary, this gave rise to a lengthy argument. Pollaczek had done nothing to conceal her Jewish provenance, while Schnitzler had plenty of opportunity to observe the uglier face of antisemitism in Vienna during the 1920s and early 30s. Despite the arguments, neither partner took the decision to end their relationship. Pollaczek noted in her diary, \\"he still keeps on insisting that he wants me and cannot let me go. He wants his freedom, he wants to be alone, and then he wants to be with me again, and somewhere in the world I should always be on hand for him, and no one is so important to him as I am\\" (\\"Er immer wieder, er will und kann mich nicht verlieren. Er will seine Freiheit, er will allein sein und dann auch wieder mit mir und ich soll irgendwo in der Welt immer irgendwo f√ºr ihn vorhanden sein und niemand bedeute ihm so viel wie ich.\\"). The more frequently they were apart the more frequently they attended the cinema together. Film choice was apparently indiscriminate, ranging from sentimental gimmicky productions to world acknowledged classics. Both Schnitzler and Pollaczek recalled approximately 500 of these cinema visits in their respective diaries between 1923 and 1931, providing insights into how different films were received by the public as well as the individual events surrounding their own cinema visits. From Pollaczek diary entries it appears that these cinema visits served a distractive function. During the final year of Schnitzler's life the two of them also discovered listening to the radio together as an alternative pastime. Schnitzler's health problems and physical decline are also recorded in her diary. At the end she described his death on 21 October 1931: \\"I held his head in my hands till his last breath\\". A celebration of his life took place at the Burgtheater on 15 November 1931. Clara Katharina Pollaczek delivered the memorial address in the form of a five stanza poem that she had written for him.

The story depicts the struggles of a Spiritual Baptist community from the passing of the Prohibition Ordinance to repealing of the ban, portraying a 20-year struggle from 1932 to 1951. Themes such as racism, women in society, religion, change, oppression, power and authority are featured throughout the book.  Plot summary  This story is narrated by Eva Dorcas. She and her husband, Bee Dorcas are a religious couple who are both members of the Spiritual Baptist Church in a small Trinidadian community known as Bonasse. They all share their experiences about being persecuted due to their direct affiliation with their religion. They also share how they were betrayed by someone to whom they entrusted their faith for a change. Trust became an issue for the fellow characters since Ivan Morton betrayed them when he entered into the political life and evacuated the house his father built on his own to live in a colonial home, located on top of the Bonasse hill, that was once occupied by an English family known as the Richardsons. The community praised Bolo for his masculinity in defending his fellow neighbours until he was taken to prison. After his release he was no longer the person he once was, of which the community now fear.  Main characters  * Bee Dorcas: Eva Dorcas' husband, a father to five children, installed as Shouter Baptist church's pastor and believed to be a strong Christian. The entire community admired Bee, and considered him as the pillar of the community due to his wisdom and patience. He loved being appreciated and knew how manage his responsibilities in a professionalized manner without converting it into a burden. Bee eventually becomes aware of that repression occurring upon losing the respect of his children and the disintegration of the church. Bee shows his anger when he breaks the law and deals with the consequences. * Eva Dorcas: Bee's wife and mother of his five children. Eva is characterized as an emotional supporter for her husband and believed to be a strong Christian follower just as her husband. Known to be the narrator and explained every aspect of everyone‚Äôs life in details. * Ivan Morton: once a teacher before he became affiliated with politics. He was known as the new individual within the country's legislative council, but brought disappointment when he broke his promise to help lift the ban. He was known to be the \\"bright\\" person in the community even though he had failed his college examination not only once but twice. * Bolo: known as the best of all stick fighters in the community and was crowned as champion. With such emphasis, the community viewed him as a hero and a warrior figure. He was later imprisoned for defending both his mother and the church. The imprisonment had changed his well being from the most loved individual to the terror of the community after a year.  Major themes and symbolism  Shouter Baptists or Spiritual Baptists observe a combination of Christianity and African traditional practices. Conflict arose between the English government and citizens of Trinidad because Christianity has a direct link with English authorities and Shouter Baptist was a form of rivalry in the eyes of the colonial authorities, since Trinidad was still a colony under the British Empire. This conflict resulted in the passing of Shouter Prohibition Ordinance in 1917, portraying religious oppression. The betrayal of Ivan Morton results in a dramatic change within the lives and faith of the community, emphasizing the toll that power and authority takes on someone's personality. Ivan Morton became the main disappointment when he decided not to support the Shouter Baptist religion and followed the colonizers' orders. Politics in this community is a depiction of the various characteristics of Caribbean political leadership. Members of the community connected their faith with their daily lives by reciting Bible verses throughout the novel depicting religion as a major theme. The Shouter Baptist Church symbolizes unity and a form of identity. Members of the community adore the church and claim it is the foundation of their tradition, a connection with their ancestors who were slaves.

This theory was proposed by Paul Slovic and Deborah Small. This theory is directly linked to that phenomenon which states if the number of people in need of help increases, the amount of compassion people would feel toward the people decreases. Psychic numbing is also directly linked to the collapse of compassion as well. Slovic introduced the concept of psychophysical numbing, which is the diminished sensitivity to the value of life and an inability to appreciate loss.Slovic, Paul; David Zionts; Andrew K. Woods; Ryan Goodman; Derek Jinks (August 2011). \\"Psychic numbing and mass atrocity\\". New York University School of Law: 1‚Äì17. SSRN 1809951 Freely accessible. Researchers proposed that in the human mind, large groups are almost staggering and therefore they rather participate in regulating their emotions to limit their overwhelming levels of emotions due to their experiences. This is because individuals tend to draw out no emotion regulation compared to that of the groups. Psychology The collapse of compassion happens because people actively, perhaps subconsciously, regulate their emotions to withhold the compassion they feel for the groups of people who suffer. It is not because people are less capable of caring about plenty suffering rather than individuals who suffer. This can also be put as withholding our compassion for a wide range of sufferers not being a part of us from birth, rather it is something we do almost actively, in that moment people actively reduce or remove their affection. Economic and political views The phenomenon of the collapse of compassion has also been written about in modern journalism and media reports. On 13 January 2015, Mark Hay reported that the massacre carried out by Boko Haram received almost no immediate media attention. However, on 7 January 2015, when 12 satirists from Charlie Hebdo magazine were killed in Paris, \\"the media erupted (and continues to erupt) with heartfelt outrage and constant coverage.\\" Journalists like Simon Allison of the Daily Maverick have clarified bias media coverage as a sign that the media and the world do not mourn deaths in Africa the way they do in the West, this obvious bias in media coverage also points towards a more understated failure in our natural human ability to gather any empathy as the number of victims rise following a mass killing or to see past the fact that numbers of people are not people, but that they are numbers. Economic theorists argued that emotions and helping behaviour should track the number of people in need of help, we should respond more strongly when more people are suffering, whatever the context.Schelling, T. (1968). The life you save may be your own. In S.B. Chase, Jr. (Ed.), Problems in public expenditure analysis (pp. 127-162). Washington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution. Yet when psychologists measure actual emotion and helping behaviour, this is not the observed result. People tend to experience strong emotion in response to one individual in need of aid, and this translates into a strong desire to help. But when there are many individuals, people actually feel less emotion and act less charitably.Dunn, E.W., & Ashton-James, C. (2008). On emotional innumeracy: Predicted and actual effective response to grand-scale tragedy. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44, 692‚Äì698. Compassion fatigue The collapse of compassion may be linked to that of compassion fatigue as well. Individuals with a higher capacity or responsibility to empathize with others may be at risk for compassion fatigue or stress, which is related to professionals and individuals who spend a significant amount of time responding to information related to suffering, according to Figley.Figley, Charles (1995). Compassion Fatigue: Coping With Secondary Traumatic Stress Disorder In Those Who Treat The Traumatized. London: Brunner- Routledge. . However, newer research by Singer and Ricard suggests that it is lack of suitable distress tolerance which gets people fatigued in compassion activities.Ricard, Matthieu (2015). \\"IV\\". Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World. Brown and Company. pp. 56‚Äì64. Research suggests that practice of nonjudgmental compassion can prevent fatigue and burnout.Differential pattern of functional brain plasticity after compassion and empathy training, Olga M. Klimecki, Susanne Leiberg, Matthieu Ricard, and Tania Singer, Department of Social Neuroscience, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences Experiments Ka Ho Tam Ka Ho Tam hired 242 undergrad students to participate in his study, they read stories of people from different parts of the world who shared their experiences (e.g. having a family gathering) or specific to a particular culture (e.g. celebrating an Ethiopian festival). Thereafter participants of 1 to 8 poverty- stricken Ethiopian children, along with a description of how people from that part of Ethiopia are suffering. Lastly, these participants did questionnaires to measure similarity with and compassion toward the Ethiopian children. He found that, the reading of the shared experiences drew out compassion toward a single victim and not multiple victims. This can be further explained by saying that people actively suppress compassion when they think it might be overwhelming; this means that humans respond to the suffering of others based on their own self-interest. C. Daryl Cameron and B. Keith Payne Cameron and Payne's experiment tested whether removing a source of motivation to regulate would reduce the collapse of compassion. Other researchers like Kogut and Ritov and Small et al. who also did studies included measures of three alternative explanations for the collapse of compassion: psychological distance, diffusion of responsibility, and success in helping the victims. People might experience less emotion toward multiple victims because they feel a greater psychological distance from these victims; because they feel less responsible for helping; or because they feel that their helping will not matter much. If these alternatives were to be eliminated however, these explanations would more support the financial cost as a critical factor in the collapse of compassion. The nine items measuring compassion were averaged together. A two-way between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effects of help request and number of victims on compassion. There were no significant main effects of help request, or number of victims. However, there was a significant interaction between help request and number of victims. The pattern of means for the interaction between compassion, help request, and number of victims was displayed, this interaction suggests that the difference in compassion toward one versus eight victims depended upon whether participants expected to be asked to help those victims. They probed the interaction by first examining the effect of the help request separately in the one-victim and eight-victim groups. In the one- victim condition, there was not a significant effect of help request on compassion. In the eight-victim condition, by contrast, participants reported significantly greater compassion when they would not be asked to help than when they would be asked to help. They also examined the effect of number of victims separately in the help-request and no-help-request conditions. When help was requested, participants reported numerically greater compassion toward a single victim than toward eight, although this simple effect was not significant. In contrast, when help was not requested, eight victims elicited significantly more compassion than one victim. By removing the expectation that participants would be asked to donate money, they were able to reverse the typical collapse of compassion pattern.

Description Lecythis minor is a small to medium- sized tree that ranges from in height and has a diameter at breast height. Its bark is grey, and is smooth when the tree is young but develops deep vertical fissures as the tree ages. It has ovoid leaves that are about long and wide. The leaves are glabrous and coriaceous, with serrated margins. The leaves have 12 to 19 pairs of lateral veins, and the leaf stalks are and puberulous. The flowers of Lecythis minor are arranged on a rachis, being long, and the inflorescences are white to yellow, green while budding. Each rachis has 10 to 75 flowers, and the rachides are pubescent. The fruit of the tree have a distinct cup shape representative of the genus Lecythis, and are spherical with a thick pericarp.(1855)Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh The seeds are reddish-brown and fusiform, and contain toxic amounts of selenium. The seeds tolerate a very low pH. Habitat and ecology Lecythis minor is common in South America. It ranges from the Maracaibo lowlands of Venezuela to the northern coast of Colombia where it ascends the Magdalena and Cauca valleys. It was introduced in many other places in South America as well, from La Lima in Honduras to Soledad in Cuba. It occurs in dry, open, and disturbed habitats, where it grows as a small and many-branched tree. It can also be found in moister forests where it forms a taller, single-trunked tree. It grows especially well along rivers in tropical forests. The tree tolerates an annual precipitation of , an annual temperature of , and a soil pH of 5.0 to 8.0. The tree is pollinated by bees and seeds are dispersed by fruit bats. Uses It is cultivated as an ornamental tree in many places, such as the Summit Gardens in Panama. The nuts of the tree are collected when ripe, and the tree can produce fruit as young as tall. In indigenous medicine, the fruit is supposedly antiasthmatic and depilatory.John H. Wiersema, Blanca Le√≥n (1999) World Economic Plants: A Standard Reference Chemistry The seeds are toxic, especially when consumed in large quantities. The toxicity is derived from the amino acid in the plant that is a selenium analog to cystathionine, through which selenium is stored in the seeds during reproductive growth. The seeds contain approximately 85% of the tree's total selenium in the form of selenomethionine. The seeds taste agreeable, but can induce nausea, anxiety, and giddiness, and can cause loss of hair and fingernails. Dickinson found that after consuming 300 to 600 seeds he had temporary loss of hair and fingernails. The toxicity can vary depending on the soil, as some evidence suggests that seed toxicity increases as the amount of selenium in the soil increases.

He was the second of eight children raised by Antonia Fraudnich and August Pagel. Friedrich took after his father physically in having great size and strength. His first working years were spent as a blacksmith, but after qualifying at seventeen, he joined a ship's crew as a stoker. After extensive travelling he went ashore at Sydney, Australia, and was employed in various menial occupations. His robust build found him a position as bouncer at a licensed restaurant where he also peeled potatoes and washed dishes. In 1899 in Tasmania he met and married Mary Dinsdale (1865-1939), a Yorkshire woman with a keen understanding of financial matters. Under her guidance their fortunes improved, while Pagel's act gained renown. In 1904 the couple visited Europe, and in England assembled the equipment necessary for a travelling circus. A voyage along the African East Coast saw them landing at Durban in February 1905. They toured the province, continuing to Johannesburg where Pagel worked on extending the repertoire of his circus. A tour of South Africa followed and another to Rhodesia, the success of which established Pagel's Circus as a national institution. Pagel's feats of strength and his control of the big cats soon made him a household name, particularly in the countryside. However, the circus as a career remained financially hazardous. In early 1906 Pagel and his wife travelled to India and Burma to acquire tigers, elephants and other animals. Madame Pagel herself entered the ring in an act starring lions, tigers and leopards. The Circus flourished until the advent of the First World War (1914-1918) when Pagel, because of his German origin, was regarded with grave suspicion by the authorities, and crowds became openly hostile. Madame Pagel displayed her marriage certificate above the box-office in an attempt to defuse the situation. Even so Pagel was interned at Pietermaritzburg near the beginning of 1918 for a brief period. After the War he acquired South African citizenship.

Aging can be done under a number of conditions, and for a number of reasons including stronger umami flavors and tenderness.  Drying  Drying of foods by leaving them in a low-humidity environment has been used as a food preservation technique for millennia. Air-dried meat such as jerky may have been some of the first preserved foods ever eaten by man. Drying also concentrates flavors in foods by removing water from them.  Fermentation  Foods may be aged to allow fermentation to occur, such as in the making of alcoholic beverages, in cheesemaking, in pickling, such as kimchi, and in meat or fish products such as fermented sausage or surstr√∂mming.  Culturing  Besides fermentation, microbial food cultures can act on food products to alter their chemical make-up and provide additional flavors. This is especially true in processes such as the making of blue cheese or aged beef.  Extraction  In the case of beverages, such as the aging of wine, beer, or whiskey, storing the beverage for extended periods of time in wooden casks allows the liquid to extract flavor compounds from the wood itself, adding to the complexity and depth of flavor. Traditional Balsamic Vinegar is aged for years in a succession of oak barrels to extract and concentrate flavors.

Historically, charity evaluators have focused on the question of how much of contributed funds are used for the purpose(s) claimed by the charity, while more recently some evaluators have placed an emphasis on the cost effectiveness (or impact) of charities.  Charity Watchdog  A charity watchdog is a type of nonprofit organization that provides ratings of charitable groups based on how an individual charity's money is spent, how it governs itself, and how the charity protects its donors' privacy, among other criteria.\\"Understanding Charity Ratings\\". Consumer Reports. Retrieved November 2015. Charity evaluation from these organizations has typically focused on measuring administrative and fundraising costs, salaries, and assessing how large of a proportion of a charity's budget is directly spent on impactful activities. In 2000, Ministry Watch, an evangelical Christian organization that reviews Protestant ministries for financial accountability and transparency, was founded. Charity Navigator was launched in 2001 by John P. Dugan, a wealthy pharmaceutical executive and philanthropist. Initially, Charity Navigator provided financial ratings for 1,100 charities, and has data on 8,000 as of mid-2016.Ann Carrns. Charity Navigator Tweaks Its Rating System. New York Times. 27 May 2016. The Toronto Star has reported on some of the difficulties and revelations of auditing charities as described by Charity Intelligence Canada (Ci). The authors call it \\"concerning\\", for example, that one in five of \\"Canada's top 100 charities\\" refused to release their full audited financial statements to CIC. Moreover, one quarter of the \\"top 100 charities\\" store at least 3 years worth of funding (that is, they have three times their annual budget in savings) and some store as much as 8 years worth. Of the \\"top 100 charities\\", 14% exceed the guidelines set by the Canada Revenue Agency by spending more than 35% of donations on fundraising ‚Äì with some spending as much as 50% of donations on fundraising.\\"Audit of charities encounters resistance\\", in The Star, by Raveena Aulakh and Amy Dempsey, published Tuesday Nov 15 2011 In 2015 the British government announced the creation of a new government-run watchdog to regulate large charities. The United States of America has numerous of charity assessment websites such as GiveWell and the cited Charity Navigator to monitor and update the public on the activities of local and national nonprofits.  Impact-based evaluation  In 2006, hedge fund employees Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld formed an informal group with colleagues to evaluate charities based on data and performance metrics similar to those they used at the fund. The group was surprised to find the data often didn't exist. The next year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld formed GiveWell as a nonprofit to provide financial analyst services to donors. They eventually decided to rate charities based on the metric of how much money it cost to save a life.Patricia Illingworth, Thomas Pogge, Leif Wenar. Giving Well: The Ethics of Philanthropy, Oxford University Press US, 2011. p. 124Peter Singer. The Life You Can Save: Acting Now To End World Poverty, Random House, 2009. Ch. 6, pp. 81‚Äì104 GiveWell has focused primarily on the cost-effectiveness of the organizations that it evaluates, rather than traditional metrics such as the percentage of the organization's budget that is spent on overhead. In the first year, Karnofsky and Hassenfeld advocated that charities should generally spend more money on overhead, so that they could pay for staff and record keeping to track how effective their efforts were. This ran counter to standard ways of evaluating charities based on the ratio of overhead to funds deployed for the charity work itself. Giving What We Can, founded in 2009 by Toby Ord, also differed from other charity evaluators in terms of the importance given to metrics of charity performance, solely focusing on the cost-effectiveness of the charity's work. It has argued that the variance in cost-effectiveness of charities arises largely due to the variance in the nature of the causes that the charities operate in, and therefore has made evaluations across broad areas of work such as health, education, and emergency aid before comparing specific organizations. In practice, it recommends a selected few charities in the area of global health. Its work is similar to that of GiveWell. GWWC no longer evaluates charities but, like the National Philanthropic Trust, it accepts philanthropic members and helps them to donate to charities. Charity Navigator's former CEO Ken Berger and consultant Robert M. Penna harshly criticized the idea of discriminating among cause areas for being moralistic and elitist \\"by weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another\\". Philosopher and effective altruism advocate William MacAskill defended the concept by comparing the choice to donate to an art gallery with the choice of saving a painting rather than saving people from a burning building. In 2013 and 2014, GuideStar, BBB Wise Giving Alliance, and Charity Navigator wrote open letters urging nonprofits and donors to end the use of the overhead ratio as the sole or main indicator of a nonprofit's performance. Charity Navigator has also been working to expand its criteria to include results reporting. See Charity Navigator ¬ß Evaluation method.

Early life Cash Luna was born into a Catholic household. His parents divorced when he was young and he grew up with his mother. At age 20, Luna became a born- again Christian. He studied at the Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n, where he graduated with cum laude honors and holds a bachelor's degree in Information Systems Management. Casa de Dios Luna and his wife, Sonia de Luna, founded the Casa de Dios church in Guatemala City in 1994. The church is today one of the largest growing congregations in Guatemala, with a claimed 25,000 in weekly attendance. In April 2013, a massive new church complex was unveiled with an area of 270,000 square meters and the capacity to fit 12,000 worshipers at a time. Influence and legacy Luna preaching in January 2018 Luna is well known for his televangelism and presence on social media. His Facebook account had a million and a half fans as of 2015. In addition to his large congregation in Guatemala, Luna has a significant number of followers and fans in Mexico as well among Hispanic Americans in the United States. Luna is well known for his creative methods of preaching, one time riding into church on a motorcycle. He is also considered one of the more influential preachers of the prosperity gospel in Latin America. In 2013, Luna was presented with an award by the then-Guatemalan President Otto P√©rez Molina (PP). P√©rez stated that Luna had provided an example of what Guatemalans could achieve through faith and working together. He also applauded Luna's efforts to end violence and drug abuse. During the 2015 Guatemalan general election, Luna was a strong supporter of candidate Jimmy Morales (FCN), who later won the election. Morales, who is a devout evangelical Christian, had strong support from Luna and other evangelical pastors. During his presidency, Morales visited the Casa de Dios on multiple occasions. False reports of death In August 2017, rumors started spreading on social media that Luna had died after a prolonged absence. He later rebuked these rumors on his Instagram page, stating that he was \\"alive and kicking\\". Criticism Luna has been criticized for his faith healing activities and amassed wealth. In June 2014, Luna staged a faith healing event in Villahermosa, Mexico where he claimed that the blind would see, the deaf would hear, and the disabled would walk out of their wheelchairs. Despite initially promoting the event as being free, attendees were charged 500 pesos to the event. Luna ended up making a profit of 15 million pesos from the event (roughly about 1 million USD at the time). The same event was also highly controversial because of the death of Nancy Hern√°ndez √Ålvarez. Nancy's parents, inhabitants of Chiapas, had brought their disabled daughter to the service in hope that she would be healed. During the service, Nancy was brought up to Luna who proclaimed her healed of her ailments while the crowd applauded what they perceived as a miracle. Shortly afterwards, however, Nancy suffered from a heart attack and died the following day. Luna refused to admit that his healing had not worked, saying that God had created Nancy and it was God who called her back. In December 2018, Guatemalan authorities ordered an investigation into Luna over alleged links with Marllory Chacon, a convicted drug trafficker. According to accusations listed in a report by Univision, Chacon, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison in 2015 in the U.S., was given money by Luna, who allegedly knew about her drug-related activity. On 5 June 2019, Luna's attorney Charles Harder announced that his client was filling a lawsuit against Univision for what they alleged were false allegations.

It was signed in December 969/January 970 between the Byzantine stratopedarches Petros and the former minister of the Hamdanids and rebel, Qarquya. Following the death of the Hamdanid emir Sayf al-Dawla in 967, rebellion quickly enveloped the Hamdanids and the dynasty disintegrated into chaos and disorder. The Byzantines saw this as an opportunity to finally take control of Aleppo. Petros soon approached Aleppo, probably without orders from Constantinople, and took the city in January 970. Terms The treaty was signed sometime in the month of Safar 359 AH according to the Islamic calendar (corresponding to 14 December 969‚Äì11 January 970 CE) between Petros and Qarquya. It established the emirate of Aleppo as a Byzantine tributary state. As part of the terms of the treaty, a defensive alliance was established between Byzantium and Aleppo; religious converts would not be persecuted on either side; armies from other Muslim states would not be allowed to pass through Aleppo; taxes would be sent to Constantinople; and the emperor would nominate future emirs. The treaty proved to have a lasting influence for a relatively long period of time. According to its terms, much of northern Syria came under Byzantine rule. The new border began north of Tripoli and Arqa (in modern Lebanon), then moved east up to the Orontes River. From there it followed its course north, but apparently somewhat to the west of the actual river, as towns like Shayzar and Rafaniya were apparently not under Byzantine control. Along the border, the Arabs retained control of Hama, Jusiyah, Salamiyah, Afamiya and Kafartab. Then it passed to the highlands east of the Afrin River, leaving its fertile valley to the Byzantines; the Arabs retained control of the Jabal al-Sumaq massif with the towns of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man and Ma'arrat Misrin, Qinnasrin, the eastern part of Jabal Halaqa and the bulk of Jabal Sim'an with al-Atharib and al-Balat, Arhab, Basufan, and Kimar. The Jabal al-A'la, Jabal Barisha, the western part of Jabal Halaqa, and the Qal'at Sim'an fortress-monastery, formed the Byzantine side of the border. The border then followed the edge of the plain, west of Jabal Barsaya, Wadi Abi Sulayman, Azaz, and Killiz, up to the Pass of Sunyab, located by Ernst Honigmann at the sources of the Quwayq River. From there the border turned east, passing north of Nafuda, Awana, and Tall Khalid to the Sajur River, which it then followed until its junction with the Euphrates. The Byzantine emperor would recognize Qarquya as the rightful emir, and his lieutenant Bakjur as his heir. Subsequently, however, the emperor would name both the emir and the qadi from the city's inhabitants. In return, however, Aleppo and its territory became tributary to Byzantium to the order of 700,000 silver dirhams annually, or a head tax of one gold dinar (equivalent to 16 dirham). Furthermore, an imperial official was installed in the city to collect a 10% tax on all goods imported from Byzantine territory, and the emirs of Aleppo were forced to prohibit armies from other Muslim states to pass through their territory, provide intelligence on any such armies moving against Byzantium, and render military assistance to any Byzantine army operating in Syria. The legal standing of Christians in Aleppine territory was guaranteed, and any slave or robber who fled from Byzantine territory had to be returned, along with any Muslim spy who came to gather intelligence on the Byzantines. Aftermath With the direct control of Aleppo now secured, the Byzantines also directly benefited from a new influx of trade in the region. The defense of Antioch was also now greatly enforced. The treaty was generally respected by the Hamdanids and the Byzantines for the next fifty years, despite the attempts of the Fatimid Caliphate to occupy Aleppo.

H. Willis (13 July 1908 ‚Äì 12 March 1984) was an English mechanical and electrical engineer and archaeologist, who excavated the Iron Age settlement at the hamlet of Dainton, at Ipplepen, Teignbridge, Devon in the late 1940s. The son of William Willis, J.P., a timber merchant and farmer, formerly a mounted police officer and inspector for the Fisheries Commission, Willis was brought up at St John's Wood, Marylebone, and educated at the Mercers' School, then the University of London and Faraday House Electrical Engineering College (at which he would later lecture). He served in the Royal Artillery and, during the Second World War, with the R.A.F. in India. His uncle was Frederick Smythe Willis, an accountant (a founder member and first hon. treasurer of the Corporation of Accountants of Australia) and Mayor of Willoughby, New South Wales, the Willises- a wealthy farming family- having settled in New Zealand in the late 1800s; he was a descendant of the colonial judge John Walpole Willis (and so a relative of his elder brother, William Downes Willis, a clergyman and theologian).

The concept originated in the 1890s United States, experiencing a peak of popularity there in the early 1900s. Until the advent of the common home telephone, Halloween cards occupied a role similar to Christmas cards and birthday cards. Today, many cards from the popular designers of the period are sought after as memorabilia. History Early 20th century Halloween card featuring racist caricatures of black children An early reference to a Halloween card is made in volume 4 of Ingall's Home and Art Magazine published in 1891, in which a sample design is depicted in the article Domestic Helps for the Home by Laura Willis Lathrop. Early Halloween cards typically depicted the same themes as Easter cards and Christmas cards, as publishers reused images for various holidays, with the caption signifying the specific holiday. From about 1900 to 1915, the United States experienced a Halloween \\"postcard craze\\" that continued the commercialization of the holiday that began in the 1800s. By 1909, the Souvenir Post Card Company of New York City produced 12 Halloween card designs. The popularity of Halloween cards rivaled that of Christmas cards until about 1930, by which time telephones were common household items and began supplanting the use of greeting cards. Halloween-themed postal cards were sold in post offices and by private printers with displays in general stores. Their popularity and the holiday's commercial success was \\"ultimately determined\\" by women, particularly those in the middle class. Of the over 3,000 cards produced in the United States during this period, many depicted themes common to the modern tradition, including witches, pumpkins, and goblins. Other Halloween postcard themes included fortune-telling and romance or courtship. Designs also reflected the racism In the postcards produced by the Rust Craft Greeting Card Company from 1927 to 1959 catalogued by Wendy Morris, twelve categories of ethnic imagery were identified. The most common theme being black children, appearing on 42% of cards depicting an ethnic or racial difference from the white majority. Designers A 1904 postcard designed by Ellen Clapsaddle Well-known early postcard printers include Winsch and Raphael Tuck & Sons. Both printers employed artists whose postcard designs are collectables sought by Halloween memorabilia collectors. Winsch works by Samuel Schmucker (described as \\"small masterpieces of art nouveau\\" by Lisa Morton in her book The Halloween Encyclopedia) and Jason Freixas are highly prized. Among the artists employed by Tuck were Francis Brundage, and the \\"queen of postcard artists\\", Ellen Clapsaddle.

Gloria Graciela Gallardo (October 16, 1938 - February 14, 2012) was a Chicana activist and former religious sister. She is best known for her involvement in the 1970 student boycotts in Houston, coordinating the huelga schools and for co-founding Las Hermanas.  Biography  Gallardo was born in San Antonio. She became a member of the Sisters of the Holy Ghost. After taking vows, Gallardo began to work what was considered a \\"rough\\" part of town, Alaz√°n- Apache Courts in San Antonio. She worked for several years in barrios in San Antonio. In 1969, she was asked to come to Houston to work as the interim director of the Mexican American Education Council (MAEC). In this capacity, she helped support student boycotts against unfair policies, protested and spoke publicly for MAEC. Gallardo was a leader in the Mexican American boycott of the Houston public schools in the early 1970s. In September 1970, she set up special schools, called strike or huelga schools, for students to get an education while they were boycotting the school district. Gallardo met Sister Gregoria Ortega through a friend, Father Edmundo Rodriguez in 1970. Together, they worked to identify Hispanic nuns in the United States and invited them to join a group. While they were working on the project, Ortega, who had recently been fired from her diocese had no income, and Gallardo shared her salary from her work with the Galveston-Houston diocese. Gallardo and Ortega then worked together to invite Mexican American nuns to create an organization for Spanish speaking religious women in April 1971. The group was formed and called Las Hermanas. Gallardo was elected to be the first president of Las Hermanas at this first meeting. Gallardo also edited their newsletter, Informes, which was first sent out on September 19, 1971. In 1972, Gallardo resigned from the leadership team of Las Hermanas. She didn't like the change in direction the organization was taking. Eventually Gallardo left religious life and was married. She had a son, Ervey Longoria, in 1977. Gallardo died in 2012.

Principal photography began on 13 September 2017. The film released in India on 22 December 2017. Plot The film starts from Mangalore, where a group of smugglers discussing to smuggle black money of 500 Rs. Gang member of smugglers Prabhakaran hires 2 distinct state labours to handover a box of coinage by which they can earn crores of money. As per his instruction, they make him unconscious and escapes to a local station named Gomangalam, state of Tamil Nadu. In the highrange of Idukki lives Shaji Pappan (Jayasurya), who is now living with all of his troubles and Back Pain. He now leads a normal life with his friends in house along with his mother and niece. He earns a living by farming. When Krishnan (Bhagath Manuel) and Capt. Cleetus (Dharmajan Bolgatty) are on the way to Pappan's estate with manure, they are blocked by Sub Inspector. Here enters Shaji Pappan, who gets enraged and throws him into a nearby dam without knowing there is some sandalwood along with manure. The offense is charged on him on case for throwing a SI and illegally smuggling sandal. Later he is bailed out on wherewithal of hostage of 2 person and a compensation of Rs. 50,000, on a condition of signing at the local police station. On the other side, Sarbath Sameer (Vijay Babu), after getting suspended from his department, requests to P.P Sasi Aashan, who is now Home minister to give back his position. On Sasi's recommendation, Sameer again becomes SI where Shaji resides. Shaji and his team decide to compete in a tug-of-war tournament in which the first prize is a massive gold trophy. They find out that the entry fee costs Rs. 5 Lakh; and the only way to get that amount of money is by putting Shaji's house on mortgage. His mother furiously objects to this idea, forcing Shaji to steal the documents and secretly giving it to Irumbu Abdullah. Shaji's team starts training for the tournament. The scene then cuts to Dude (Vinayakan)and his gang. After their failure to complete their mission in the prequel, the gang along with the driver Paili are unable to go back to Bangkok. Dude now works in a restaurant situated in the Kerala-Tamil Nadu borders under the name Sulaiman. The gang starts digging a tunnel to rob a bank near the restaurant. Meanwhile, Shaji's team enters the tournament and triumphantly wins the gold trophy. The team comes home and Shaji boasts about his victory to his mother and spills the beans about stealing the documents. Shaji decides to flaunt the trophy but then they realize that their trophy is stolen and replaced with a bamboo one. At this point Shaji's mother suffers a seizure and is carried to the hospital. Upon waking up, she curses loudly at Shaji, blaming and scolding him. Later Kuttan Moonga (Vineeth Mohan) tells Shaji that he tracked the person who stole the trophy. The thief was Anali Sabu (Anson Paul), brother of the deceased criminal Chekuthan Lassar. His team had been second in the tournament. Seeking revenge, Shaji and group break into Sabu's dance party to retrieve the trophy. They also beat up Sabu and his men and destroy the place in the process. A few days later, Shaji returns home to find his house in flames. They are shocked to see Anali Sabu and his supposedly-dead brother outside. Lassar demands a hefty sum as compensation for the damages they had done at the party. Shaji is knocked down unconscious and ends up at hospital next to his mother. Dude's gang completes the tunnel after six months of hard work and Paili commits the heist on 8 November 2016. Unfortunately, Prime Minister Narendra Modi orders demonetization of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 500 notes the same night; shocking the entire nation and especially Dude. Shaji regains consciousness the next day and learns about the demonetization. As a result, Shaji is left unsure of how to raise money for all these expenses piling up on him. This is also bad news for underworld dealer Satan Xavier (Sunny Wayne); but Kanjavu Soman (Sudhi Koppa) and Battery Simon (Bijukuttan) who had started working for Xavier because of financial crisis are hit even harder. At the same time, Mahesh Shetty, who is involved in counterfeiting business, is also disappointed. But the next day, he receives an offer from one of his white-collar friends who says that he can give him the engraving plates of the new 500 rupee notes which have not yet been released. He demands $2 million in US dollars for the plates and Shetty agrees. But Shetty's trusted partner (Irshad) decides to cheat him by making a deal with Satan Xavier for $3 million. He does this by hiring two Bengalis to take the plates and knock himself out, giving the impression of theft. Soman goes to Dude's restaurant and the latter is furious on seeing him, but learns about the deal. Dude decides to return to his former self and steal the plates. But first he attacks his employer and blows up the restaurant. Shaji Pappan, having run out of ideas to raise money, decides to fix his back and beat up Lassar's back. Arakkal Abu (Saiju Kurup) contacts a Bengali doctor form Rajasthan to buy backache medicine. Coincidentally, the engraving plates and the medicine were to arrive at the same station. Shaji and team reach the station first and receive the plates instead, and Xavier's men (Soman and Simon) get the medicine. After a series of relentless pursuits to retrieve the plates by Xavier, Dude, Abdullah and Shameer, they end up in the hands of Shaji and his team.

It is the third book in the Kingsbridge Series, and serves as a sequel to 1989's The Pillars of the Earth and 2007's World Without End. Plot Beginning in 1558, and continuing through 1605, the story chronicles the romance between Ned Willard and Margery Fitzgerald, as well as the political intrigue of the royal courts of England, France, and Scotland, and the oft-times violent conflict between supporters of the Catholic Church and the rising Protestant movement in the late 16th century. As depicted in the early chapters, the city of Kingsbridge is ruled by an oligarchy of rich merchants, who sit on the city council, with the most powerful family holding the position of the city's Mayor. The plot concentrates on three families which represent the main political and religious divisions in the English society of the time. The Fitzgeralds are a staunchly Catholic family, which under the Catholic Queen Mary gives them an advantage over the others and the position of Mayor. They seek to upgrade their social position by a marrying into the titled aristocracy. At the opposite pole are the intransigently Puritan Cobleys, who secretly hold Protestant worship - a highly dangerous act under Catholic rule. Their strong religious principles do not, however, stop the Cobleys from resorting to occasional underhand tricks to cheat their competitors and employees, and dabbling in the new lucrative field of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. In between are the more pragmatic Willards - nominal Catholics under Mary, but who would turn Protestant once Elizabeth came to power. In the book's early part, the dominant Fitzgeralds make use of their alliance with the ruthless Catholic Bishop Julian to hit at their rivals. They get Philbert Cobley burned as a heretic for conducting a Protestant service and drive the Willards virtually bankrupt by strictly enforcing anti-usury laws which are usually regarded as a legal fiction (since in fact all merchants take interest on loans). This forces Ned Willard to take service with Princess (later Queen) Elizabeth, rather than pursuing his family's traditional commercial activities - eventually ending up as the Queen's spy master. Later on, with the Protestants gaining ascendancy, they take revenge on the Fitzgeralds, making their commercial activity dependent on renouncing the Catholic faith - thereby driving Rollo Fitzgerald out of business and into becoming an exile Catholic Priest and a mastermind of Catholic plots against Queen Elizabeth with pseudonym Jean Langlais. With these two major viewpoint characters thrown out of Kingsbridge and into the wider scene, the book's focus changes. Unlike the two previous novels in this series, a large portion of the plot takes place outside the town of Kingsbridge, utilizing such far-flung settings as London, Paris, Seville, Geneva, Antwerp, Scotland and the Caribbean, and involving many major characters who have no direct connection with the town. In the later part of the book, Ned Willard's nephew Alfonso restores the Willard family fortunes conducting projects designed by his grand-mother and becomes the new Mayor like his grand-father. However, to the end of the book the local affairs of Kingsbridge remain secondary to the greater political and religious struggles. The later parts of the book focus on the deadly battle of wits between Catholic conspirator Rollo Fitzgerald, hatching sophisticated dangerous conspiracies, and Ned Willard, the Royal spymaster tasked with uncovering and foiling these conspiracies. In many ways this echoes, under 16th Century conditions, the themes of Follet's WWII spy thriller Eye of the Needle - which featured a similar struggle between German spy Henry Faber (\\"Die Nadel\\") and MI5 spy catcher Percival Godliman. Historical events The plot includes extensive depictions of several important historical events of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Follett in general follows known historical facts, but altering them to the extent necessary for his fictional characters to play a significant role: * The death of King Henry II of France in a jousting accident - a traumatic event setting the stage for the decades- long French Wars of Religion. * The Massacre of Wassy on 1 March 1562, the first major event of those wars. * The escape of Mary, Queen of Scots from imprisonment at Loch Leven Castle (1568), described in great detail from the point of view of the fictional Alison McKay, to whom Follett attributed the part of various actual ladies in waiting and servants of Queen Mary. Alison McKay is depicted as afterwards strongly but vainly urging Mary not to take the decision to go to England - a fatal mistake which led to a much longer imprisonment which the loyal Alison shared up to the moment of Mary's execution. * St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572) in which Catholic mobs massacred thousands of Protestants in Paris. Conflicting interpretations of this catastrophic event were current at the time and are still debated among modern historians - some regarding the massacre as the unplanned culmination of escalating religious tensions, while others attributed it to a deliberate Machiavellian planning. In the latter case, the blame for planning the massacre is variously attributed to the Guise Family, leaders of the fanatic Catholic League, to King Charles IX and his mother Catherine de Medici, or to both. Follett's account attributes to the book's main villain, Pierre Aumande - an intelligent, capable and utterly ruthless man - the main responsibility for planning and initiating the massacre. He is depicted as manipulating the Guise Family, the King and his mother and the Mayor of Paris, getting the Paris militia mobilized on false pretexts and then made to start killing Protestants, and making deadly use of meticulous lists of the names and addresses of Paris Protestants, which Aumande had compiled through previous years of systematic espionage. In all that, Aumande is shown as being motivated mainly by opportunism, seeking to bolster his position as the Guise Family's main adviser, and he also makes of use of the general massacre to sadistically settle some personal accounts. The protagonist Ned Willard and Sylvie, the French Protestant woman he loves, get only a belated warning of the impending massacre and are able to warn in time only a few of the threatened Protestants - at considerable risk to their own lives. * The Babington Plot (1587) in which Queen Elizabeth I's agents got hold of secret correspondence in which Mary, Queen of Scots explicitly assented to the conspirators' plan to kill the Protestant Queen Elizabeth and place the Catholic Mary on the throne - the evidence which led to Mary being executed for treason. Follett attributes to Ned Willard - working in the Queen's Secret Service as Francis Walsingham's deputy - the credit for having painstakingly uncovered the plot and intimidated Gilbert Gifford into becoming a double agent and delivering to the Queen's agents the letters sent to and by Mary. In actuality, Gifford was recruited by Walsingham himself. * Drake's raid on Cadiz in 1587 - emphasizing that as well as delaying the sailing of the Spanish Armada, the English raiders were motivated by seeking to loot Spanish ships (including Follet's viewpoint character, the sea captain Barney Willard). * The Spanish Armada (1588), by which King Philip II of Spain sought to conquer England. Follett attributes to Ned Willard two important contributions to the English victory. First, years earlier, Ned talks to his brother Barney, a seasoned English sailor whose ship had done well in a sea battle with a Spanish galleon off Hispaniola. Based on that experience, Barney believes that England should not seek to build galleons of its own, but rather create a navy composed of \\"smaller, more agile ships, which could dance around a galleon and rake it with cannon fire\\". Ned conveys this advice to the Queen, who acts on it - and builds the ships which would eventually defeat the Armada. Closer to the events, Ned Willard goes on a dangerous spying mission from Antwerp to Calais, to assess the Spanish strength. From his merchant cousin, based in Antwerp, Willard hears of the Hellburners, fireships employed against the Spanish during the recent Siege of Antwerp. On this basis, Willard advises the English commanders to load the cannons of the fireships sent into the port of Calais, so that even with no human crews they would start firing when the fire gets to them. This turns out to be very crucial, as otherwise the Spanish might have been able to tow the English fireships to burn harmlessly in the open sea. Without the fireships causing the Spanish ships to scatter and break formation, the outcome of the entire battle might have been different. As depicted in the story, neither Ned not anyone else is aware of the crucial role his advice had in the English victory. Only the omniscient writer conveys it to the reader by shifting back and forth between the English and the Spanish points of view. In his depiction of the Armada, Follett clearly strives to be fair to both sides, several times emphasizing that both the English and the Spanish had courageous fighters and skilled sailors. * The Gunpowder Plot (1605), in which Catholic conspirators sought to blow up the English Parliament and kill in one blow the recently enthroned King James I, his sons Henry and Charles and all his principal ministers and advisers, and to use the resulting power vacuum to seize power. Follett attributes to the book's antagonist, the staunch Catholic Rollo Fitzgerald, the role of initiating the plot and recruiting Guy Fawkes to implement it. To Ned Willard is attributed the role of uncovering the conspiracy and averting it at the last moment. For dramatic purposes, Follett omits the historical fact that the gunpowder had undergone some deterioration and might not have exploded. As depicted in the book, it was completely combustible and the plot might well have been carried out, with drastic results for later English history, but for Willard discovering it in the very nick of time.

Reception  Bill Sheehan of The Washington Post summarizes the book by commenting: \\"Like its predecessors in the Kingsbridge series, ‚ÄúA Column of Fire‚Äù is absorbing, painlessly educational and a great deal of fun. Follett uses the tools of popular fiction to great effect in these books, illuminating a nation‚Äôs gradual progress toward modernity. The central theme of this latest book ‚Äî the ongoing conflict between tolerance and fanaticism ‚Äî lends both relevance and resonance to the slowly unfolding story of England‚Äôs past.\\"  References  2017 British novels British historical novels Novels set in the 16th century Novels set in Tudor England Cultural depictions of Henry III of France Cultural depictions of Catherine de' Medici Cultural depictions of Henry I, Duke of Guise Cultural depictions of James VI and I Cultural depictions of Guy Fawkes Cultural depictions of Mary, Queen of Scots Cultural depictions of Elizabeth I Cultural depictions of Mary I of England ","title":"A Column of Fire"},{"id":"55276536","text":"Comparison between a standard and Wuest herringbone gear A Wuest type herringbone gear is a special type of herringbone gear wherein \\"the teeth on opposite sides of the center line are staggered by an amount equal to one half the circular pitch\\".

His collection of 500 letters to his lord, Baron Tam√°s N√°dasdy is one of the most important primary sources of the 16th-century Hungarian history. Biography √Åkos was born in the early 16th century into an untitled lower noble family which originated from the gens (clan) Hah√≥t and had estates and villages throughout in Zala County. He was a son of royal councillor Bal√°zs (II) Cs√°nyi, who served as vice-isp√°n of Zala County and an unidentified lady from the S√°rk√°ny de √Åkosh√°za family. √Åkos first appeared in contemporary records in 1515, when a possession agreement in Somogy County preserved the names of Bal√°zs' sons in the following order: Mikl√≥s, Istv√°n, J√°nos, Gergely and √Åkos. According to √Åkos' undated letter, his father and two brothers (Istv√°n and Gergely) died of a plague in the summer of 1532. Only Mikl√≥s and √Åkos reached adulthood. √Åkos also had two sisters. Already his father, Bal√°zs joined as a familiaris to the powerful N√°dasdy family, which had large-scale landholdings in Transdanubia, including Zala County. √Åkos Cs√°nyi was among the most prominent and trustworthy officials to Baron Tam√°s N√°dasdy since the 1530s. N√°dasdy initially joined the league of King John Z√°polya after the Battle of Moh√°cs (1526). N√°dasdy and his escort, including Cs√°nyi, resided in Transylvania in the early 1530s (√Åkos' family died of plague during that time). Under N√°dasdy's banner, Cs√°nyi participated in the Siege of Pest in 1542. N√°dasdy, left Z√°polya's allegiance, and as a strong supporter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, acted as military commander (\\"captain-general\\") of Hungary and organized the border protection system against the Ottomans. Under N√°dasdy's command, Cs√°nyi served as steward (bailiff) of Kanizsa lordship (at least from 1549), which was one of the most important strongholds in southern Hungary, along with Szigetv√°r. Cs√°nyi operated and maintained an extensive spy network in the surrounding area (at Upper Balaton, including Bab√≥csa and S√ºmeg), tracing the movement of Turkish troops at the border. The two stewards, √Åkos Cs√°nyi and Jakab Szele supervised the reinforcement works of the castle of Kanizsa since the late 1550s. During that time the town and the castle were also in their prime since the first half of the 16th century, when Kanizsa became a centre of trade with Italy and Styria. Cs√°nyi resided in Kanizsa in 1566, when the Fall of Szigetv√°r occurred. Historian Ir√©n Bilkei argued Cs√°nyi functioned as steward until 1568, when the castle became a royal property after a possession contract with N√°dasdy's widow Orsolya Kanizsai. Cs√°nyi was last mentioned by contemporary sources in that year, when he appeared as an eyewitness during a lawsuit on murder charges against one of his serfs. A charter issued by the Vasv√°r Chapter in 1575 referred to Cs√°nyi as a deceased person. He had a daughter Orsolya, who married G√°bor Sitkey, and two sons M√°ty√°s and G√°bor. His letters Since 1549, when presumably became the steward of Kanizsa, he wrote 523 surviving letters to his lord Tam√°s N√°dasdy, and after his death in 1562, to his widow Orsolya Kanizsai. The compilation of Cs√°nyi's letters is the third largest collection within the N√°dasdy Archives, located in N√°dasdlad√°ny. His reports are the prime sources of the military situation in D√©lvid√©k, along the border system which defended Royal Hungary against the invasions of the Ottoman Empire since the second third of the 16th century. In addition to military data and espionage reports, Cs√°nyi often touched the mood of the local population and the economic situation at the borders which were affected by the series of invasions, lootings and clashes.

Contrast enhanced to bring out detail. Blacksmith tokens are a form of evasion currency that was in circulation primarily in Lower Canada and Upper Canada along with neighboring areas, such as the northern parts of New York and New England in the mid-1820 to 1830s. They were not, strictly speaking counterfeits, but instead skirted around the laws of the time by being similar to officially circulating coinage, but bearing different legends, or bearing no legends or dates at all, so it could be claimed that they were truly imitating circulating coinage fully.Wood p. 3-4 The tokens were designed to resemble worn examples of English or Irish copper coinage, most often with a crude profile of either George II or George III in profile on the obverse and an image of Britannia or an Irish harp on the reverse. They were typically underweight when compared to officially sanctioned halfpenny coinage, but were accepted along with many other unofficially issued tokens due to a lack of sufficient small denomination coinage in circulation at the time. Most examples were issued in copper, with a few examples struck in brass. Due to the deliberately poor nature of the images carved into the dies for these tokens, it is rare for a Blacksmith token to be graded higher than Very Fine, with most examples falling into a Good or Very Good grade. While first mentioned by noted Canadian numismatists Eugene Courteau and R.W. McLachlan, there were first fully described as a separate type of evasion currency by American numismatist Howland Wood with the publication of his pamphlet The Canadian Blacksmith Coppers in 1910. These coins, along with many other underweight copper tokens, were eventually driven out of circulation by the late 1830s as Canadian banks began to issue officially sanctioned copper tokens of the proper weight for their value. It is not known how many of these coins were made, as the creators faced possible prosecution if they were discovered. Evidence from hoards suggest that some of the blacksmith tokens were relatively common, and examples of various Blacksmith coppers have been found during archaeological excavations along with other coinage contemporary to the 1830s in the Saint John River Valley in Nova Scotia,Kleeberg p. 109 on the grounds of Fort York in Toronto,Kleeberg p. 166 and Place Royale in Quebec City.Kleeberg p. 183 The more common Blacksmith tokens can be had for about C$20-$30, while the rarer varieties for which only a handful or unique examples are known can command prices in the thousands of dollars.Evans p. 21 Name Origin The name is derived from reference by R.W. McLachlan in an 1885 article about Canadian Numismatics, where he describes a specific coin of this series and says: > Previous to 1837, when the lack of specie caused copper change to be > accepted in bulk, there lived in Montreal a blacksmith of dissipated habits. > He prepared a die for himself, and when he wished to have a \\"good time\\" he > struck two or three dollars in these coppers, and thereby supplied himself > with sufficient change with which to gratify his wishes.McLachlan 1885 p. 85 While this description was intended to describe only a specific coin in the series, \\"blacksmith token\\" or \\"blacksmith copper\\" was the name that stuck, and was soon applied to all of these types of coins. While the rarer blacksmith tokens may well have been struck by a single person by hand, the large numbers of some of the more common tokens in this series suggests that some of them came from more professional minting operations. McLachlan stated that the numerous types of blacksmith tokens available and their quantity meant that they were either struck at several different establishments in quantity, or a large number came from one establishment which operated for several years.Grawey 2016 p. 18 More recent research points to the blacksmith tokens being created at various locations in Lower Canada, and possibly in Upper Canada and the United States.Grawey 2015 p. 16 Numismatic Study Individual coins in the Blacksmith token series were described by the Canadian numismatist R.W. McLachlan in articles dating back to the mid-1880s, and several examples were also included in Pierre-Napol√©on Breton's extensive catalog of Canadian colonial tokens.Cross p. 206 Numismatist Eugene Courteau was the first to notice design similarities between several of these coins, and documented them in an article published in The Numismatist in 1908.Oppenheim p. 101 Wood's illustration for the Blacksmith tokens Wood 11 and Wood 12, the former depicting a crude Britannia figure combined with a profile of George III, and the latter the regal profile combined with an Irish harp. Howland Wood published the first comprehensive study of the series in an article published The Numismatist in 1910, titled The Canadian Blacksmith Coppers (published later that same year as a pamphlet of the same name). He noted one characteristic that was common to the series, that they were created specifically to look like worn British half-pence coins. Another common feature to most of the Blacksmith coppers was that their designs were the opposite to that of the original coin being imitated. If the coin was imitating the bust of George III on its obverse, it would face left in the Blacksmith version whereas in the officially issued coinage it would face right. Wood believed that the reason for this was the inexperience of the die cutter, who created the die facing the same way as the original coin being imitated.Wood p. 4 The reverse of many of these coins featured an image of Britannia who faced the opposite way from the original, though Wood notes that when the reverse featured a harp, it faced the same way as it did on the Irish regal coinage it was imitating.Wood p. 4 Most of these regal imitations were created using copper, though he notes a few that were done in brass.Wood p. 4 Though Wood had no conclusive proof, he thought the regal imitation Blacksmith tokens were created in the first quarter of the 19th century, noting a particular specimen that had been struck over a George IV half-penny of 1825, so clearly not struck before that date, and was likely struck sometime soon after that date.Wood p. 4 This has been further corroborated in more recent times with the discovery of a Blacksmith token that had been struck over an Upper Canadian token dating to 1820.Faulkner p. 259 In addition to the Blacksmith tokens that imitated English and Irish regal coinage of George II and George III, Wood also pointed out a second series of Blacksmith tokens which he considered to be \\"curiosities and puzzles\\", consisting of mules that mixed up dies from various store card tokens with other crudely made dies.Wood p. 5 One of these mules includes dies made for a store card token that was released within the United States in 1835, meaning that the Blacksmith version could not have been issued prior to this date. Given that the banks of Upper and Lower Canada started issuing their own officially sanctioned tokens of the correct weight for their value in 1838, Wood believed this series of tokens must have been created between those dates.Wood p. 5 Wood also pointed out the relative scarcity of these Blacksmith tokens when compared to those imitating regal coinage, believing that they were issued in limited numbers.Wood p. 5 Wood counted 46 distinct varieties of Blacksmith tokens.Wood p. 9 Subsequent research has shown that two of Wood's Blacksmith tokens are in fact worn imitation coppers of British origin, and a third token listed by Wood a copper variant made of brass is in fact made of copper.Oppenheim p. 101 A study by Oppenheim cataloging the auction of a prominent Blacksmith token collection added several more Blacksmith tokens and variants that were unknown to Wood;Oppenheim p. 101 the Charlton catalog of Canadian Colonial Tokens lists 56 Blacksmith tokens and varieties.Cross p. 207 Blacksmith tokens are recognized as falling into specific categories based on the design they were imitating: those containing a regal profile, imitations of the Tiffin plus \\"Bust and Harp\\" tokens, those with blank reverse, imitations of the \\"Ships Colonies and Commerce Tokens\\", the \\"BITIT\\" Series, those based on worn Daniel and Benjamin True token dies, and other miscellaneous types.Willey p. 306-312 Research continues in this area, the most recent contribution being by John Lorenzo who has done extensive X-ray fluorescence studies of various Blacksmith tokens in order to determine their metal composition. Some of his discoveries including finding that the die axes described for some varieties in existing coin catalogs should be considered approximate, identifying additional sub-varieties to Wood 29 and Wood 38, and suggests that there are at least four major \\"families\\" of Blacksmiths whose production are linked based on the dies that were used.Lorenzo p. 6 'BITIT' Tokens Wood's illustration of Wood 33, with indistinct legends for the tops of the letters along the circumference of the obverse and reverse. The \\"BITIT\\" blacksmith tokens (Wood 33) is considered to be the most common of the Blacksmiths series,Oppenheim p. 102 and one of the most controversial in numismatic literature. The obverse contains the profile of George III with what Wood described as a \\"large pug nose\\",Wood p. 8 while the reverse has a seated Britannia holding a shamrock. Unlike most Blacksmith tokens, this coin features a legend on both sides, with the tops of the letters obscured by excessive die polishing, possibly done on purpose.Hoover p. 3281 There has been considerable interpretation as to the reading of the legend of the token, as the missing top portion of its letters supports different readings. McLachlan interpreted the inscription on the obverse as saying \\"GLORIUVS III VIS\\",McLachlan 1885 p. 85 though some numismatists contemporary to McLachlan suggested that the \\"VIS\\" should instead be read as \\"VTS\\", which is claimed to be an abbreviated, Latin version for \\"Vermont\\". McLachlan refuted this claim, saying that he had \\"little doubt that this piece was struck and issued in Canada as an imitation of a George III copper\\".McLachlan 1885 p. 86 This argument has been picked up again in more recent numismatic studies, with one article affirming that an example graded as Fine reveals the \\"I\\" should be read as \\"T\\", supporting the \\"VTS\\" reading.Biancarosa p. 4184 An off-center strike of this Blacksmith token in the collection of the Bank of Canada Museum where the top portion of the supposed \\"T\\" ought to be more visible, but is not, contradicts this reading.NCC p. 86 Wood thought that the obverse legend read \\"GLORIOVS III VIS\\".Wood p. 8 A more recent article claims that several high-grade examples of the coin reveal a weak serif and cross-bar on the \\"L\\", and that the first \\"O\\" is thinner than the second, suggesting that the initial word of the legend should be read as \\"GEORIUVS\\" instead.Hoover p. 3281-3282 The legend on the obverse has been interpreted as reading as the nonsensical \\"BITIT\\",Wood p. 8 though one study claims that the \\"I\\" and \\"T\\" are instead an \\"R\\" and \\"I\\", making the word read \\"BRITI\\" instead, a short form for \\"BRITISH\\".Hoover p. 3282 In his comprehensive listing of Blacksmith tokens, Wood included this in his \\"Miscellaneous and Doubtful\\" series, suggesting that it might be an imitation regal coin created in England, but sharing the common Blacksmith token characteristic of the regal bust facing the opposite way.Wood p. 8 While McLachlan clearly thought that this coin was issued in Canada and was relatively plentiful, it is notable that it was not included in Breton's Illustrated History of Coins and Tokens Relating to Canada, possibly because he thought it was a British import.Hoover p. 3279 While American numismatist John H. Hickcox believed the coin to have come from Vermont, the majority consensus of other mid-19th century U.S. Colonial numismatists omit the coin in their listingsLeonard p. 4224 While the provenance of this coin is still debated, examples of this coin appearing in the hoard McLachlan described and archaeological finds in locations in Upper Canada, Lower Canada and New Brunswick establish that it circulated in Canada.Leonard p. 4224 Notes Bibliography    Coins Coins of Canada Copper coins Forgery ","title":"Blacksmith token"},{"id":"55276754","text":"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshitoki ≈åima.

He was beaten by large majority as apparently he only declared himself a candidate shortly before the poll began.

Introduction and History  The show was first hosted by transgender woman Jin Xing (ÈáëÊòü), who said that \\"Nowadays the social network are more lonely and less reliable, bringing their parents to find their companion for dating is the traditional way of Chinese people is it, for the first time in TV show.\\" Jin Xing has revealed in 2017, she will serve as host on Dragon TV's Blind Date program Chinese Style Blind Date. The show provides for young people to find the marriage opportunity, in depth communications between parents and children to achieve their parents desire for building an inter-generational relationship on platform, including discussions about inside and outside of emotional, inter-generational contradictions and social topics. In the program show, candidates get the urge to marry from their parents who are either sitting on the stage and backstage for observation. The 5 groups of parents would sit behind each podium to face a single guest and compete for their favorite companion as they want, for their children or child sitting in the soundproof room.  Premise  Every episode there would be 5 candidates with their parents on the program. The program alternates between a male version and a female version each week. After the introductions of each family, the children of the 5 groups of parents are sent to the soundproof room. A single candidate of the opposite gender then goes on stage one by one to the face the parents of the 5 candidates, whilst not being able to see the faces of their children The single candidate then plays two videos to reveal information about themselves including their occupation and past relationships. During this time, the parents compete for the final 3 spots. In between the videos, the candidate, the parents and the host exchange banter with each other when videos are not shown. The children in the soundproof room are able to see the candidate through a separate screen and are also able to communicate with their parents through calling them on the phone in between videos. After both videos have been shown, if the 3 finalist spots are not filled up, the host then asks the children in the soundproof room if they want their parents to join the other finalists. If the remaining children in the soundproof room (who are not finalists) chose not to join the finalists with their parents, the candidate leaves without a date. If the candidate is successful in being able to get 3 groups of parents to fill up the three finalist spots, the candidate then puts forward a question to the three groups of parents from a set menu of queries. Following that, they are able to choose one of the children from the three groups of parents as their date.

She is best known for her support of students in an Abilene school walkout and her co-creation of the religious organization for Hispanic sisters and lay women in the Catholic Church, Las Hermanas. She continues work as an activist today.  Biography  Ortega was raised in El Paso, Texas and attended Bowie High School. When she was very young, her father impressed on her that being a sister was an important job, saying, \\"They are women who dedicate their entire lives to the Church and to God.\\" She became a sister at 18 when she joined the Our Lady of Victory Missionary Sisters, also known as Victorynoll. She was newly professed in 1962. After taking vows, she served in San Angelo and Eagle Pass, Texas. On August 5, 1967, she took perpetual vows and then was assigned to Tulare, California. Ortega also spent time studying Spanish in Guanajuato City. In 1969, she arrived in Abilene. She started teaching religious education in the highly segregated schools in the diocese of San Angelo. Ortega opposed the \\"severe physical abuse of Chicano/a students by their teachers. She encouraged her students to learn about peaceful civil rights protests which led to a nine-day walkout which Ortega supported. Around 300 students participated in the walkout. Ortega also helped support the students throughout the lawsuit which the students and their families brought against the Abilene School Board. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) was involved with the lawsuit which was filed in December of 1969. MALDEF counsel supported the students' rights to free speech and assembly. Without support from her superiors, alone, \\"she faced down police officers, judges, school principals and school boards.\\" Ortega's life was threatened for her involvement. Because of her involvement, she was expelled from the diocese. In 1970, she helped form a Chicano group to deal with issues facing Mexican Americans in the public schools in Rotan. Ortega met Gloria Gallardo through a friend, Father Edmundo Rodriguez, and the two of them worked together to form Las Hermanas in 1971. When Gallardo showed interest in creating a group for Spanish-speaking sisters and invited Ortega to live with her, Ortega obtained travel funds from Victoryknoll's mother superior and bought a one-way ticket to Houston. Gallardo and Ortega formed Las Hermanas by finding and inviting Mexican-American women to meet in Houston in April 1971. The group eventually grew to have around 900 sisters who were members, and met annually. In 1973, Ortega and other members of Las Hermanas protested for farmworker's rights in Fresno. Later, Ortega and Sister Carmelita Espinoza were involved in the creation of El Centro Guadalupano, which served Mexican parishioners and was created between 1985 and 1986 in Spokane.

Its decision to defend DACA, Johnson said, came in part because of the organization's traditional role of being a voice for Black communities, including immigrants. ‚ÄúDACA, oftentimes people seem to think of the Latinx community, when in fact it was far more reaching than that,‚Äù Johnson said.\\" Protesters outside Trump Tower in New York City, September 5, 2017 President Derrick Johnson, expressed in a statement: \\"For far too long, the voices of the undocumented DACA recipients from the African Diaspora were silenced. There is no democratic dream for anyone if we don't allow our DREAMers to fully participate. This is a tremendous victory for America. Today's Supreme Court ruling in our favor is an incredible victory for justice, in the spirit of the NAACP's groundbreaking Supreme Court victory in Brown v Board of Education. We know the value of affirmative litigation to ensure that the nation lives up to its ideals. This ruling exemplifies the ways in which ensuring the Civil Rights for our community pushes the needle on social justice for the benefit of all. Although today represents an exciting victory, we won a battle; the war wages on. Trump could rescind DACA again tomorrow if he wants. The fight truly ends when Congress passes a permanent solution that protects DREAMERS, and the NAACP will continue that fight along with its allies.\\" The Washington Post also reported that \\"Trump has often seemed ambivalent about DACA recipients ‚Äî lauding them at some points and declaring they are ‚Äúno angels‚Äù at others ‚Äî but his administration has tried since September 2017 to end the program. It was implemented as an executive action by Obama in 2012 after a failed congressional attempt at comprehensive immigration reform.\\" Justice Roberts wrote in an opinion that \\"the dispute before the court is not whether DHS may rescind DACA.

In a live interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe, Johnson called Facebook \\"one of the biggest threats to democracy'. It was later revealed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were working with the NAACP in this campaign. President Johnson praised the couple for embodying ‚Äúthe kind of leadership that meets the moment.\\" He added, \\"The NAACP deeply value your unwavering support to Stop Hate For Profit.\\" In an interview with Forbes, Johnson said, \\"the flagrant disregard Facebook has shown in putting a stop to the hateful lies and dangerous propaganda on its platform exemplifies a lack of concern for the greater public and nullifies any notion of corporate social responsibility coming from its leadership. Any brand that claims to have the best interest of its consumers in mind should undoubtedly join the #StopHateForProfit campaign. Facebook is ultimately damaging its credibility with the American public, and any company that wants to avoid doing the same should send a message that we will no longer accept disinformation during this critical time.\\" By July 3, over 750 advertisers joined the boycott, including Unilever, Ben & Jerry's, Patagonia, The North Face, Lululemon Athletica, Coca-Cola, Ford, Starbucks, Target, Pfizer, Microsoft, PlayStation, LEGO, Dunkin Donuts, Best Buy, Adidas, Clorox, and Walgreens. In response to these efforts, on July 1, 2020, CNBC reported that \\"Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to meet with the organizers of the boycott, a spokeswoman said late Tuesday.\\" On July 7, 2020, Members of the Stop Hate For Profit coalition met with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. CNN first reported that the meeting \\"didn't go well\\" . Derrick Johnson added, in an interview with The New York Times, that ‚ÄúOver the two years that the N.A.A.C.P. has been in conversation with Facebook, we‚Äôve watched the dialogue blossom into nothingness,‚Äù Mr. Johnson said. ‚ÄúThey lack this cultural sensitivity to understand that their platform is actually being used to cause harm, or they understand the harm that the platform is causing and they have chosen to take the profit as opposed to protecting the people.‚Äù CBS Studios Partnership On July 15, 2020, The NAACP and President Johnson announced a multi-year deal with CBS Television Studios. Variety announced that \\"Under the deal, the two organizations will work together to develop and produce scripted, unscripted, and documentary projects for linear and streaming platforms.

We are seeing high levels of scarcity, with extreme unemployment numbers, while the nation's chief executive uses his bully pulpit to sow division and demonize otherness.

The effect was first noted by J. E. Hoover and L. C. Drickamer in their 1979 study wherein they randomly assigned adult female mice to one of four treatment conditions: a control group where the subjects were exposed to water, a group that was exposed to the urine of pregnant mice, a group that was exposed to the urine of lactating mice and a group that was exposed to the urine of a singly caged female mouse. The results of their study demonstrated that the adult female mice exposed to urine of pregnant or lactating females exhibited significantly longer mean periods of oestrus than adult females mice that had been in the control group or exposed to the urine of the singly caged female mouse. The female mice exposed to the urine of the pregnant and lactating mice were also found to ovulate during this atypical, longer oestrus period and successfully conceived and bore litters when mated with male mice. Hoover and Drickamer also found that while their initial method had been to psychically paint their subjects with the urine used, when mice were exposed to the urine by a capsule containing a soaked cotton ball, the effect still occurred, demonstrating the airborne nature of the pheromones in the urine of the pregnant and lactating mice.  Discovery  The Hoover- Drickamer effect was initially demonstrated in J.E. Hoover and L.C. Drickamer's 1979 study. The researchers noted that while other studies had examined the effect of urine from pregnant and/or lactating females on the onset of puberty in young female mice, no work had been done to examine what urine from pregnant and/or lactating females would do to oestrous cycles in already matured female mice. Their research utilized two different experiments to demonstrate that female mouse oestrus cycles were effected upon exposure to urine from pregnant and/or lactating mice, and that pheromones were involved in this process. In their first experiment of the study, Hoover and Drickamer randomly assigned 80 adult female rats to four treatment groups, a control group where subjects were exposed to water, a group where the subjects were exposed to the urine of pregnant mice, a group where the subjects were exposed to the urine of lactating mice and finally a group where subjects were exposed to the urine of a singly caged female mouse. Their findings were that subjects exposed to the urine of pregnant and lactating mice were in oestrus for significantly more days relative to the female mice in the control group or when exposed to the urine of the singly caged female mouse. Their second experiment of the study utilized the same four subject groups, but they changed their method of exposing their subjects. Rather than painting the mice with the urine, they housed their subjects were capsules that contained soaked cotton balls (varied between water, urine from pregnant mice, urine from lactating mice and urine from a singly caged female, like experiment one). Parallel to the results of their first experiment, subjects housed with the capsules injected with the urine of pregnant and lactating mice demonstrated significantly more total oestrus smears over a twenty one day period, more complete oestrus cycles and a longer total duration of oestrus cycles relative to the subjects in the control group and the group that was exposed to the urine of the singly caged female.  Hypothesized mechanisms  Hoover and Drickamer's original study did not delve into any specific mechanisms of action for the effect on female oestrus cycles beyond stating that the results of their work support the conclusion that some factor in the urine of the pregnant and lactating mice used did act to affect the oestrus cycles of the subjects used. Their conclusions suggested exploring the excretory components of the urine of pregnant and lactating mice to explore whether any substances in it constituted a pheromone that could impact mice on a physiological level such that oestrus cycles could be affected. A 2006 study by Stephen D. Liberles and Linda B. Buck demonstrated that in mouse olfactory epithelium, there is a specialized receptor sub-class called the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR). Some of these receptors were found to be activated by volatile amines in mouse urine and at least one presumed mouse pheromone. Future research requires a more specific breakdown to assess if the urine of pregnant and lactating mice is composed a particular set of amines, pheromone(s) or another chemical compound that may explain how mature female mouse oestrus cycles are effected by the urine of pregnant and lactating female mice.  Behavioural expression  Female mice have been demonstrated to show sexual receptivity behaviour, including lordosis behavior when in estrus. Estrus results in the release of hormones such as estrogen and estradiol that facilitate sexually receptive behaviour. Lordosis in particular increases the likelihood of a successful copulation, and therefore overall reproductive success. Lordosis, like the Hoover-Drickamer effect, has been demonstrated to be initiated, at least in part, by sexual signals detected by olfactory chemosignals.  Theorized purpose of the effect  Hoover and Drickamer's original discovery of the effect did not explicitly explore any potential adaptive features it may have. As estrus increases the likelihood of sexually receptive behaviour in females, such that overall reproductive success is more likely, it may be the case that a prolonged estrus cycle is adaptive in the sense of allowing for a longer period of sexual receptivity for successful copulation and reproduction. A similar phenomenon of menstrual synchrony has been investigated multiple times to determine whether or not it even exists, and if it is adaptive in nature. The same cannot be said of variations in duration of estrus. The rationale behind investigations into menstrual synchrony could also be applied to duration of estrus, including male monopolization of fertile females. While one argument against menstrual synchrony is to reduce interfemale competition, particular differences between species in terms of mating period and length may influence how useful the ability to mediate and change estrus is in the first place. Given that mice can breed year round, it may be adaptive for females to be able to influence each other's frequency of sexual receptivity in order to increase the likelihood of overall species survival. Hoover and Drickamer's other work exploring the effect of urinary chemosignals on the change of the onset of puberty in female mice proposed a similar underlying mechanism that the urine of the pregnant and lactating females speeding up the onset of puberty in female mice signals that environment and/or social conditions are optimal for reproduction. This included factors like available food supply, weather conditions, and nest sites and materials. It may be the same for inducing a longer estrus cycle in other adult females such that mature female mice may also take advantage of environmental and social factors that increase the likelihood of successful reproduction. This could be explored by manipulating whether or not pregnant and lactating female mice continue to give off a urinary chemosignal when mating conditions are not optimum condition.

It is a rectangular masonry tower covered with white tiles. The south side has two red horizontal bands that serve as identification during daylight. History On August 1, 1878, two red lights were introduced at Alto de Caxias and Porto Covo. These directed the path that vessels should follow when entering and exiting the Port of Lisbon. Initially the lights were housed in wooden constructions but in December 1879, when the towers had been completed, fixed red lights were installed in both. They each consisted of a catoptric device with a parabolic reflector and an Argand lamp with two twists. In 1913 it was decided to transfer these lights to Esteiro and Gibalta with the intention that these, together with the nearby Mama lighthouse would mark the channel into Lisbon's port. The Esteiro lighthouse went into operation in May 1914. Its tower is 15 meters high and the light is 82 meters above sea level. It is several hundred metres inland, about 800 metres northeast of the Gibalta light. The optical apparatus is dioptric catadioptric, a fifth-order bulls-eye Fresnel lens. The light is red, fixed, illuminating an arc of 15¬∫. From March 1916 to December 1918, it was not used due to World War I. In 1926 two red central stripes were painted on the face of the tower facing south, thus showing five bands of equal width, alternately white and red. A building was built next to the tower in 1949 in order to install a radio beacon. The light was electrified with power from the public grid in 1951. In the event of a power failure, an automatic backup generator was available. Also in 1951, a flashing light was introduced with four-second flashes. In 1957 a new installation means that in the event of electricity failure, the light automatically switches to acetylene gas. In 1970, four fluorescent lamps of mounted in watertight containers on the outside of the tower. Since 1997 the Esteiro lighthouse has been lit continuously throughout the year. A radar beacon has also been installed.

This coral can be distinguished from the corallimorph Corynactis californica, which it somewhat resembles, by its stony skeleton, and from Caryophyllia alaskensis, another stony coral found in this habitat, by its brighter colour (C. alaskensis is beige). Distribution and habitat The species is native to the western seaboard of North America, from British Columbia to Baja California. It occurs on rocky coasts from the low intertidal zone down to about . It appreciates habitats with vigorous water movement, such as surge channels, and often grows in caves and under overhangs. It is often found living amongst kelp such as Macrocystis integrifolia. Biology Being an azooxanthellate coral, that is, not containing symbiotic dinoflagellate algae that photosynthesise, B. elegans feeds on whatever the tentacles can catch, with the aid of their nematocysts (stinging cells) and spirocysts (cells containing hollow adhesive threads which coil around the prey). The mouth is large and slit-shaped, and it is possible that some prey is caught by use of the mesenteries in the gastrovascular cavity while opening the mouth wide, however its main prey is zooplankton caught by the tentacles. This coral can also extract dissolved organic carbon from sea water, and during the winter months, when there is a scarcity of zooplankton, this source of nutrition may be critical for the coral's survival. The sexes are separate in this coral. Fertilisation takes place inside the female's gastrovascular cavity, and the larvae are brooded there. They are later released as worm-like orange larvae and settle nearby.

Biography Alba Rosa grew up in Milan, where she was admitted to the Milan Conservatory at the age of 8. She was the youngest student ever to be admitted. At the age of 14 she continued her studies in Brussels, after a short stay in Uruguay. Here she studied under the famed violinist C√©sar Thomson and later she studied under the creator of the Sevcik violin method, Otakar ≈†evƒç√≠k. One of his notable students was Jan Kubel√≠k, who would become her mentor and to whose memory she dedicated her Elegie. In 1919 she settled permanently in the United States, and married Jan Fresemann Vi√´tor, a Dutch businessman who was a skilled amateur violinist. After a successful career as a violinist, in 1916 she played alongside Camille Saint-Sa√´ns on piano during a tour in Argentina, she decided to end this and dedicated herself completely to composing. After her divorce (the marriage was dissolved in 1940; Jan died in 1953 in Panama) she became a member of the National Association for American Composers and Conductors. She composed prolifically for orchestra, voice and various solo instruments. Several American orchestras and soloists including the National Gallery of Art Symphony Orchestra and the Frost Symphony Orchestra, have performed her works. Her compositions were performed in the same program as Charles Ives, Aaron Copland and John Philip Sousa by the National Gallery Orchestra in 1950. The most important element that dominates all of Alba Rosa Vietor's work is not the form but rather the mood she wishes to convey. Lawrence A. Johnson calls one of her best known works, Primavera Lombarda (Springtime in Lombardy), \\"an intriguing moody Mediterranean tone poem\\". After her death in 1979 her compositions fell into oblivion. Due to the initiative of her son Hendrik Vi√´tor to digitize the works of his mother, her works have been performed more frequently since 2003. Her works have been archived by the Marta & Austin Weeks Music Library of the University of Miami. Alba Rosa Vi√´tor played with Saint Sa√´ns in Argentina in 1916  The Alba Rosa Vi√´tor Foundation and Alba Rosa Viva! chamber music festival The Alba Rosa Vi√´tor Foundation was founded by Mary van Veen-Vi√´tor, Hermance Vi√´tor and Maarten van Veen in 2009 to promote knowledge of Rosa Vi√´tor's music and to encourage improvisation and composition, particularly by female composers. The Foundation has published a book, The Story of Alba Rosa Vi√´tor: Violinist and Composer 1889 ‚Äì 1979 (2009), which includes essays about her works by Paul Janssen and Peter Fraser MacDonald, as well as a list of compositions. The Foundation have also released a CD with a recording of her Piano Trio Op. 8 by the Storioni Trio. In 2014, the Foundation started a biannual chamber music festival, Alba Rosa Viva! This festival is not only intended to make the works of Alba Rosa heard, but also to draw attention to other female composers, whose works are rarely heard in the classical music halls. Some recent compositions are always part of the festival program. The Festival is an idea of artistic director Reinild Mees, who had already put Alba Rosa Vi√´tor‚Äôs music in the spotlight during the Women's Music Marathon in the Concertgebouw Amsterdam. The Foundation also organizes the biennial Alba Rosa Vi√´tor Composition Competition for composers up to 35 years old, with a jury headed by composer Willem Jeths. The compositions of the finalists are performed during the festival.

Chi is included in Time magazine 's 100 Most Influential People of 2020. Activism In March 1986, Chi became the first person in Taiwan to come out as gay on national television, organizing a press conference to announce both his sexuality and his launch of a campaign to prevent the spread of AIDS/HIV. After meeting his current partner in 1988, Chi worked as the country's only AIDS/HIV activist, operating a halfway house for HIV and AIDS patients and advocating for safer sex among the country's LGBT community. In 2000, he achieved controversy in the Taiwanese LGBT community when he struck a deal with a local credit company to hire people with AIDS to work as debt collectors, which campaigners condemned as exploitative to endangered people.Aids patients used as debt collectors, Danny Gittings, The Guardian, Tuesday 25 July 2000 20.38 EDT Chi also advocated for recognition of same-sex unions. In 1986, Chi applied to the Taipei District Court notary office with a request for a notarized marriage license, which was promptly rejected; his appeal to the Legislative Yuan was also rejected in harsh terms. Soon afterward, on August 15, he was detained by police with being involved with a robbery, which he denied. Sentenced to a five-year sentence, he was imprisoned for 162 days that year, after which he was subsequently pardoned by a judge and freed. His imprisonment was customary of political dissidents of the late White Terror period, which ended the next year. After the Ministry of Justice ruled that marriage was only allowed for opposite-sex couples in 1994, Chi attempted to obtain a license again in 1998, eventually appealing the case in October 2000 to the Council of Grand Justice to offer a justification for their refusal to grant him a marriage license. A judge on the panel rejected his appeal due to the appeal not specifying the existing laws and regulations inconsistent with the Constitution. On 21 March 2013, he once more applied for a license; when he was denied, he appealed upward to the Taipei City Government's Department of Civil Affairs, who referred the constitutionality question to the Taipei Higher Administrative Court and then the Supreme Administrative Court in 2015. Both Chi and the Department requested a constitutional interpretation on the issue and asked the court to focus on whether Taiwan's Civil Code should allow same-sex marriage and if not, whether that violates articles under the Constitution of the Republic of China pertaining to equality and the freedom to marry. On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled in Interpretation No. 748 that the Civil Code's restriction of marriage is unconstitutional, and ruled that same-sex couples will be allowed to marry on or before 24 May 2019.

McBride, also spelled MacBride (January 5, 1850 ‚Äì September 18, 1909), was an American journalist and clubwoman. She founded several women's press associations, most notably the New England Woman's Press Association. She wrote and lectured on domestic science, and was active in charitable causes and local politics. It was largely due to McBride's activism that the state of Massachusetts began hiring matrons for city police stations and built a separate facility for female inmates in Boston.  Biography  Marion A. McBride (n√©e Snow) was born on January 5, 1850, in Easthampton, Massachusetts, the only child of Joseph Preston Snow. She was educated in New York, but spent most of her life in the Boston area.  Journalism career  She began her career at the New York Tribune before taking a job in 1880 as a special editorial writer for the Boston Post. She was a reporter and correspondent for the Boston Post from 1881 to 1885. After leaving the Post she worked as a freelance writer, contributing regularly to the Boston Globe, the New York Herald, the New Orleans Picayune, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Northampton Herald & Post, the Chicago Inter Ocean, and the St. Louis Chronicle. She headed a department of American Art, and wrote articles about domestic science for the Decorator and Furnisher, the New England Magazine, and other periodicals. At the World Cotton Centennial in 1884, McBride was superintendent of the press for the woman's department. While she was there, working with women of the press from all over the country, she organized the National Woman's Press Association (NWPA). Within two years the NWPA had evolved into the International Woman's Press Association. The organization spawned several local chapters, including the Illinois Woman's Press Association, the Ohio Woman's Press Association, the Southern Woman's Press Association, and the New England Woman's Press Association (NEWPA). McBride initiated the founding of NEWPA in 1885. At the time, newspaper women were still a rarity; one 1887 Boston Globe headline referred to the women of NEWPA as \\"lady newspaper men.\\"  Police matron bill  Her Boston Globe obituary suggests that she was best remembered in Boston for her work with \\"Mrs. Charpiot's home for intemperate women,\\" and for her work on the police matron bill. Starting in November 1886, McBride led a campaign to hire matrons to work in Boston's police stations. By May 1887, the Massachusetts legislature had passed a bill to appoint police matrons in all Massachusetts cities, and establish a house of detention for women in Boston. Massachusetts was the first state to pass such a law.  Charitable and other activities  In the early 1880s, McBride organized the first Woman's Department at the annual New England Manufacturers' and Mechanics' Institute fair in Boston. She also headed the Woman's Department of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association. She was a national superintendent of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and served for many years as secretary of the Woman's Charity Club. She was a member of the National League of American Pen Women, the Rumford Historical Association, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the New England Helping Hand Society, and other civic and charitable organizations. In 1888, McBride read a paper titled \\"Women in Journalism\\" at the International Council of Women in Washington, D.C. She died at her home on Hillside Avenue in Arlington Heights, Massachusetts, on September 18, 1909. Her obituary cites \\"Paralysis\\" as the cause of death. She was survived by a son, James McBride, who worked as a naval architect at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy. Among those who attended her funeral in Arlington Heights were members of the WCTU, NEWPA, DAR, and the Home for Intemperate Women. She was buried in the family lot in Williamsburg, Massachusetts.

Announced on July 21, 2016, it is dedicated to coverage of the Atlantic Coast Conference, and launched on August 22, 2019. The channel operates from ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, though some programming and staff will be based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ahead of the television network's launch and as part of ESPN's new contract with the conference, ESPN launched the digital platform ACC Network Extra (ACCNX) on WatchESPN in 2016, which streams ACC events not broadcast on television. History There had been repeated calls for the ACC to establish its own cable channel, similar to those that had or were being established by other Power Five conferences. From July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 (in the midst of realignment that saw Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Louisville announce that they would join the ACC, Maryland leave for the Big Ten, and Notre Dame join the ACC outside of football), the ACC took in less television revenue than the Pac-12, SEC and Big Ten conferences. The Big Ten and Pac-12 had already launched their own channels, while ESPN and the SEC had announced the SEC Network would launch in 2014. SEC Network's first year of operation increased the conference's television revenue by around $100 million. In discussions with ESPN management, there were uncertainties over whether an ACC channel would be economically viable, due to cord cutting and changing television viewing habits. The stability of the ACC itself was also questioned, but was addressed in 2013 by requiring the conference's current teams to grant the ACC control of media rights to all home games through the 2026‚Äì2027 season, even if they leave the conference. This policy effectively discourages schools from leaving the ACC, and left the SEC as the only Power Five conference to not have a similar grant requirement. Eric J. Barron, president of Florida State University, stated that the grant would \\"ensure that the conference will strengthen its position of leadership among Division I athletics\\", and stated that \\"we are also very pleased that we will be moving forward on the next phase of developing an ACC network.\\" On July 21, 2016 at a media event in Charlotte, North Carolina, ESPN announced a 20-year extension of its contract with the ACC, and that it would launch a cable channel dedicated to the ACC in 2019 known as the ACC Network. The announcement was attended by then-ESPN president John Skipper and ACC commissioner John Swofford. Ahead of the television network's launch, ESPN announced that it would begin to stream ACC events beginning in the upcoming 2016 season. Following the announcement, Skipper defended the decision to go on with launching a linear television network, arguing that sports were the most valuable property on television because they are \\"the only thing you have to watch live\\". Each ACC school constructed production facilities so they can contribute programming to the channel. Its operations are based out of ESPN's main studios in Bristol, but some programming originates from Charlotte, North Carolina (where SEC Network, and formerly ESPNU, also operate). In November 2018, it was officially announced that ACCN would launch on August 22, 2019. Opening night programming included the ESPN Films documentary The Class That Saved Coach K, which chronicled Mike Krzyzewski's turnaround of the Duke Blue Devils basketball team in the 1980s. It aired its first football game on August 29, with the defending national champion Clemson Tigers hosting the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Programming ACC Network is expected to carry 1,300 events per-year. To provide more content for the channel, the ACC agreed to expand its conference schedule in college basketball to 20 games by the 2019-20 season. ESPN also acquired the secondary ACC rights previously sub- licensed to Raycom Sports for its syndicated ACC Network (the company will continue to be involved as a subcontractee for events that can be carried by the new channel). Mark Packer and Wes Durham host the morning show Packer and Durham, simulcast on ACCN and SiriusXM. All ACC will serve as the network's general news program, while The Huddle airs on Friday nights and Saturday mornings during football season. As a prelude to the linear channel, and as part of ESPN's new rights package, ESPN's digital platform WatchESPN began to carry broadcasts of ACC sporting events not on television under the branding ACC Network Extra. ESPN promoted that it would carry over 600 live telecasts per-season. ACCNX will continue operations following the launch of the channel, becoming available exclusively to ACC Network subscribers. Carriage ESPN stated in June 2017 that it had reached carriage deals for the ACC Network with unknown providers. In October 2017, Altice USA committed to offering the channel as part of in its latest round of carriage negotiations with Disney. On December 30, 2018, Disney reached a new carriage agreement with Verizon Fios, which included carriage of the ACC Network. On March 12, 2019, agreement was reached with AT&T; to carry the ACC Network on DirecTV at launch. Live television streaming services Hulu, PlayStation Vue, YouTube TV, and TVision Home also signed agreements to carry the channel at launch.https://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/tv/warm-tv- blog/article234216067.htmlhttps://www.ajc.com/sports/college/who-carries-the- acc-network/cFfnlTZb4OxzsDxUqlrUfI/ On August 14, Charter Spectrum, the largest cable provider in the ACC's heartland of North Carolina, agreed to carry ACCN as part of a new carriage agreement covering all Disney networks (including those acquired from 21st Century Fox).

It was amplified when Penn State joined the Big Ten Conference in 1993. It has been described as \\"the nation‚Äôs fiercest wrestling rivalry\\", and has resulted in sold out venues due to the popularity of dual meets. While the Hawkeyes dominated the early stages of the rivalry, it has become more balanced of late, with Penn State taking 6 of the last 13 matches.

A resident of Cleveland, Ohio, he founded the Union Iron Works and Condit-Fuller & Co., which later merged to become the Bourne-Fuller Company. Early life Samuel Augustus Fuller was August 8, 1837, in Vienna, Ohio, one of five children born to Augustus and Mary Ann ( Hutchins) Fuller. He was a direct descendant of Edward Fuller, a passenger on the Mayflower, the ship that transported the first English Puritans (known today as Pilgrims) from Plymouth, England, to the New World in 1620. His father, Augustus Fuller, had been born in August 1805 in Burlington, Connecticut, and emigrated to Trumbull County, Ohio in 1830. His mother, Mary Fuller, was born in Vienna in August 1806. She was the sister of Representative John Hutchins, and daughter of Samuel Hutchins (who had walked from Connecticut to Ohio as part of a survey party in 1789). The Fuller family moved to Cleveland in 1847. Augustus founded a wholesale cap, hat, and fur business, and the Fullers were co-founders of the Euclid Avenue Presbyterian Church. Samuel was educated in the Cleveland public schools, graduating from Central High School in 1853 at the age of 16. Samuel joined his father's business immediately after graduation, where he trained as an accountant. He proved to be an excellent businessman, and in 1859 his father made him a partner in the firm (which was renamed A. Fuller & Son). He remained associated with his father's firm and other retail businesses for the next decade. Iron and steel industry The first iron foundry in the greater Cleveland area was founded in 1834. By 1837, there were four foundries, and by 1846 there were six. All of these were small and produced inferior-quality products, as they relied on the poor-quality iron ore found in Ohio. The metals industry in Cleveland in 1860 consisted of just three shops, which manufactured iron bar and plate. The completion in 1856 of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad through the city provided the impetus for the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Cleveland by linking the mills to sources for raw materials, opening up regional markets for iron and steel, and for allowing Cleveland to serve as a transshipment center for high-quality hematite ore from the Marquette Iron Range to inland areas. The establishment of what would become the Cleveland Rolling Mill in 1856 proved to be the starting point of the emergence of a vast steel industry in Cleveland. Another 21 iron and steel mills were established in the area between 1860 and 1866, and by the end of the 1860s steel had become Cleveland's biggest industry. Fuller joined the Cleveland Iron and Nail Company in 1869, and was elected secretary of the firm. That same year, Fuller founded the Union Iron Works at what is now the northeast corner of the intersection of Union Avenue and E. 78th Street in Cleveland to reroll worn railway rails. Henry Chisholm purchased the company in 1871 and combined it with the Aetna Iron and Nail Company. Chisholm built the massive Emma Furnace at the Union Iron site in 1872. In 1878, Canada imposed a steep tariff on imported iron and steel. Fuller transplanted his family to Hamilton, Ontario, that same year, where he founded an iron mill to meet the sudden increase in demand for domestic Canadian metals. Fuller returned to Cleveland in 1880. He bought back his old company from Chisholm, renaming it the Union Rolling Mill Co. The following year, Fuller and partner Paul P. Condit formed Condit, Fuller & Co. This new firm marketed the iron and steel Fuller's mills were producing. Henry Chisholm, who had retained ownership of the Emma Furnace, spun it off as the Newburg Furnace Co. in January 1882. Fuller purchased it in August 1883 and made it part of the Union Rolling Mill Co. again. Paul P. Condit died in February 1886, forcing Fuller to take on additional duties at the firm. To ease the workload, he brought his son, Horace A. Fuller, into the firm as a partner. Death Grave of Samuel Augustus Fuller Sr. at Lake View Cemetery. Samuel Augustus Fuller died on October 23, 1891. He had complained of feeling unwell the night before, and went to bed at about 11 P.M. He was discovered dead in his sleep from an apparent heart attack at 1:30 A.M. the following morning. He left an estate worth about $40,000 ($ in dollars). He was interred in the family plot at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. His will provided for the erection of a $1,000 ($ in dollars) funerary monument at the gravesite. Personal life Samuel Augustus Fuller amassed what The Plain Dealer newspaper called \\"a large fortune\\". He owned a home at 1120 Euclid Avenue, an exclusive area of the city known as \\"Millionaires' Row\\" and \\"The Showplace of America\\" for the vast number of homes owned by the ultra-wealthy located on the street. Fuller was a Republican, and a lifelong Presbyterian. He enjoyed all kinds of music, and sang in the Euclid Avenue Presbyterian Church choir. Fuller married 18-year-old Julia Elizabeth Clark of Cleveland, Ohio, on January 1, 1858. She was the daughter of Albert Clark, a local banker. The couple had 12 children: Albert Augustus (born October 30, 1858), Kate Amelia (born November 19, 1859), Willard (born January 2, 1861), Julia Clark (born September 12, 1862; died in infancy on April 10, 1864), Horace Arthur (born September 23, 1864), Helen Williams (born June 28, 1867), Samuel Augustus Jr. (born August 19, 1868), Charles Clark (born April 30, 1870; died in infancy on December 6, 1870), Mary Elizabeth (born October 15, 1871), Frances Kellogg (born April 3, 1876), Daphne Campbell (born July 20, 1877), and Emily Lyon (born April 20, 1880). Julia Fuller died on April 23, 1880, in Hamilton, Ontario, three days after giving birth to her daughter, Emily. On August 18, 1881, Fuller married Louise Allen Wood. She was the daughter of John W. Allen, the fourth mayor of Cleveland (1841). She married Dr. George Kip Wood, a United States Army surgeon who had been widowed about 1873. She died at her home at the Hotel Roosevelt in Washington, D.C., on May 8, 1928.; Legacy Condit, Fuller & Co. became the Bourne-Fuller Co. in 1896 with the elevation of Herbert C. Bourne to partner. Bourne-Fuller purchased the Upson Nut Company and the Union Rolling Mill in November 1911/ This marked the beginning of a number of acquisitions by Bourne-Fuller, and by 1929 it had merged with or purchased 18 companies. On December 17, 1929, the Bourne-Fuller Co., Central Alloy Steel, Donner Steel, and Republic Iron and Steel merged into a new company, Republic Steel Corporation.

Moreover, she has been the one who has performed most of these works for the first time, and those works have been created with her direct participation and have been dedicated to her. Alongside her concerts, Medea Abrahamyan has also lectured at Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory and the ten-year Tchaikovsky School for decades. She has taught students of different nationalities and educated generations of musicians in her classroom, which is now widely recognized in not only Armenia, but also abroad. She has been a member of the juries of several international, All-Union and republican competitions and has given master classes.

With a flattened head, forward-oriented and partially symmetrical feet, and tall claws, Eichstaettisaurus bore many adaptations to a climbing lifestyle approaching those of geckoes. The type species, E. schroederi, is among the oldest and most complete members of the Squamata, being known by one specimen originating from the Tithonian-aged Solnhofen Limestone of Germany. A second species, E. gouldi, was described from another skeleton found in the Matese Mountains of Italy. Despite being very similar to E. schroederi, it lived much later, during the Albian stage. Fossils of both species show exceptional preservation due to deposition in low-oxygen marine environments. Initially named as a species of the genus Ardeosaurus by Ferdinand Broili in 1938, E. schroederi has had a convoluted taxonomic history. It was initially recognized as a relative of night lizards until research in the 1960s identified it and Ardeosaurus as geckoes. However, phylogenetic analyses conducted in the 1990s suggested that it was closer to the ancestor of all squamates. Various conflicting positions were found until the advent of analyses incorporating more species and better data, which resolved E. schroederi as a close relative of geckoes in the Gekkonomorpha. However, the position of Ardeosaurus in relation to E. schroederi remains uncertain: one species, A. digitatellus, has been recovered as its close relative in some analyses, but the other species A. brevipes has been found to be more distantly related. Discovery and naming E. schroederi Type specimen of E. schroederi in the Jura Museum, Eichst√§tt In 1938, Ferdinand Broili described an exquisitely-preserved specimen of lizard, preserved top-side-up, from Jurassic-aged rock deposits in the municipality of Wintershof, Eichst√§tt, Germany. The specimen came into the possession of the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Historical Geology (BSPG), where it was prepared by L. Haimerl. It consists of a nearly- complete skeleton, albeit with a crushed skull, a tail missing the tail after the fifth vertebra (probably the result of amputation and replacement by cartilage, and several vertebrae preserved only as impressions (but their presence could still be verified by the associated ribs). A counterslab to the specimen also exists. Today, the rock deposits are known to belong to the Altm√ºhltal Formation, and the specimen and its counterslab are stored under the accession numbers BSPG 1937 I 1a and 1b. Although he was unable to examine it first-hand, Broili noted from Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer's description of the type specimen of Ardeosaurus brevipes that it bore similarities to this specimen, but also that they had important differences in snout and frontal bone shape, as well as vertebral counts. However, he hesitated to create a new genus due to the preservational state of the skull. Thus, he assigned it to the genus Ardeosaurus with reservations as a new species, A.? schr√∂deri, named after his colleague J. Schr√∂der. (The current specific name is schroederi: by Article 32.5.2.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, umlauts in German names published before 1985 must be deleted and be replaced with an \\"e\\" inserted as the next letter.) Robert Hoffstetter formally recognized the distinction between A.? schroederi and A. brevipes in 1953, and established a new generic name, Broilisaurus. However, Oskar Kuhn had already named a stegocephalian amphibian with the same name in 1938; thus, in 1958, he established another generic name for the species, Eichst√§ttisaurus. (Again, due to the ICZN, the current generic name is Eichstaettisaurus.) In 1963, Marguerite Cocude-Michel opined that E. schroederi really represented the same species as Homoeosaurus digitatellus, which had previously been named as a non-type species of Homoeosaurus in 1914 by N.M. Grier. Thus, she created the new combination Eichstaettisaurus digitatellus. Contrary to Cocude-Michel, Hoffstetter identified digitatellus as a member of Ardeosaurus separate from Eichstaettisaurus in 1964. Even though Cocude-Michel was aware of Hoffstetter's paper, in 1965 she reiterated her argument and made no attempt to address Hoffstetter. Hoffstetter responded in 1966, calling Cocude-Michel's synonymy \\"unbearable\\". He noted that it would entail the revision of the diagnostic characteristics of Eichstatettisaurus to a point where it would be practically indistinguishable from Ardeosaurus, which would contradict her family-level separation of the two. Subsequent literature has retained Eichstaettisaurus schroederi and Ardeosaurus digitatellus as separate, although they received little attention until Tiago Sim√µes and colleagues published a redescription of both in 2017. E. gouldi Type specimen of E. gouldi For many years, Eichstaettisaurus was known from the single specimen of E. schroederi until Cretaceous-aged remains were found elsewhere in Europe. In 2000, Susan Evans and colleagues described a small lizard specimen in the Berriasian‚ÄìValanginian aged locality of Montsec in Catalonia, Spain. Despite its poor preservation, the specimen was clearly distinct from the more common lizard in the locality, Meyasaurus; Evans and colleagues suggested that it held affinities to Eichstaettisaurus. In 2004, Evans and colleagues reported even younger remains of Eichstaettisaurus, which originated from the Albian-aged Pietraroja Plattenkalk in the locality of Pietraroia, which is located in the Matese Mountains of southern Italy. A specimen catalogued as MPN 19457 formed the type specimen of a new species, E. gouldi, which they named after the late biologist Stephen Jay Gould; it is a skeleton preserved bottom-side-up, which includes the skull and parts of the vertebral column and limbs. A second specimen consists of a disarticulated skull, which is preserved as part of the gut contents of an indeterminate rhynchocephalian catalogued as MPN A01/82. Both specimens are stored in the Museum of Palaeontology at the University of Naples (MPN). Description Eichstaettisaurus was a relatively small animal. E. schroederi had a snout- vent length (measured from the tip of the snout to the opening of the cloaca) of , while E. gouldi had a snout-vent length of . Skull Comparison of skulls of E. schroederi (A), unnamed Spanish specimen (B), and E. gouldi (C) Eichstaettisaurus can be identified by flattened skulls with short, blunt, and rounded snouts. E. schroederi had large nostrils. The tooth-bearing bones of the snout, the premaxilla and the maxilla, were likely connected by a band of soft tissue in E. schroederi. The premaxilla had 6 or 7 teeth in E. gouldi, but the number in E. schroederi is unknown; the maxilla had approximately 22 teeth in E. schroederi, and at least 30 in E. gouldi. The teeth of both species were small, narrow, conical, and single-cusped; they had a pleurodont implantation, meaning that they were fused to the inner side of the jawbone. Like Ardeosaurus, both species lacked the lacrimal bone, usually a part of the eye socket. Also in the eye socket, the postfrontal and postorbital bones were separate unlike Ardeosaurus, and the rearward projection of the latter bones were relatively wide. In E. schroederi, the contact between these bones was further forward than most lizards. The squamosal bones were slender and projected downwards to meet the quadrate bones, as in most lizards; unlike the Iguania and Teiidae, however, they lacked upward projections. Living geckoes lack the postorbital and squamosal bones, and they also have relatively shorter jugal bones than Eichstaettisaurus. On the palate of E. schroederi, the ectopterygoid bones overlapped the pterygoid bones at their rear. Unlike A. brevipes, E. schroederi lacked bone ornamentation and osteoderms on the skull roof. In both species, the frontal bones were fused and narrower between the eye sockets than they were at the front. The downward projections on the frontals known as subolfactory processes were well-developed in both species, but met at the midline only in E. schroederi. The suture between the frontal and parietal bones was convex in E. schroederi and concave in E. gouldi, unlike Ardeosaurus where it was straight. E. gouldi and most other lizards have fused parietal bones, but they were paired and unfused in E. schroederi. The parietals of both species lacked rearward projections and nuchal fossae. In E. schroederi, the outer edges of the parietals curved inwards, and the rearward projections known as the supratemporal processes were short, widely separated, and bore depressions. Also in E. schroederi, a pair of crests were present on the supraoccipital bone of the braincase, which were likely imprinted by the semicircular canals due to the skull's reduced ossification. Vertebrae and ribs Compared to most iguanian, gekkotan, and scincomorphan lizards, which generally have 24-26 vertebrae in front of the sacrum (or hip), E. schroederi had 31, including 7 neck vertebrae and approximately 24 back vertebrae. E. gouldi had 6‚Äì7 neck vertebrae, and an unknown number of back vertebrae. In E. gouldi, the second (axis) and third neck vertebrae were connected to the next by elements known as intercentra. In E. schroederi, most of the neck vertebrae lacked cervical ribs, save for the last two. The upward-projecting neural spines on the back vertebrae were small, and the last few back vertebrae lacked ribs in the vein of lumbar vertebrae. Zygosphene-zygantrum articulations are present on the back vertebrae of both species. The ribs were single-headed and had circular articulating surfaces. In E. gouldi, the centra (main bodies) of the tail vertebrae were broad, cylindrical, amphicoelous (concave on both ends), and bore strongly developed transverse processes. Limbs and limb girdles Foot of E. gouldi, with enlargements showing breakage of claws Eichstaettisaurus had a well-developed acromion process, or the attachment for the clavicle, on the scapula (shoulder blade). The clavicles of E. schroederi did not curve forward, unlike most members of the Autarchoglossa, and also lacked rearward projections. As in Ardeosaurus, both species of Eichstaettisaurus had relatively stout forelimbs. In E. schroederi, the olecranon process of the ulna was well-developed. In E. gouldi, the carpal bones were likely not fully ossified. The five-digited hand of E. schroederi bore 2, 3, 4, 5, and 3 phalanges (finger bones) on each digit; the second-to- last phalanges from the tips were relatively long. E. gouldi appears to have had 4 phalanges on the fourth digit, and its claws were short, deep, and sharp, with well-developed flexor tubercles. In the pelvis of E. schroederi, the expansion of the pubes into the fused pubic apron was relatively narrow; the pubes also lacked the forward projections known as the pubic tubercles. The ischia were enlarged and contacted each other extensively, and the rear expansion of the blade of the ilium was long. Both Eichstaettisaurus species had stout hindlimbs similar in length to the forelimbs. The femur had a straight shaft, unlike most other lizards where it is sigmoidal. In the foot, the first metatarsal bone was slightly shorter than the second to fourth metatarsal bones. Unusually, the fifth metatarsal bone was much shorter and hooked. In E. schroederi, the foot was five-digited like the hands, with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 4 phalanges on each digit, and the second-last phalanges and claws were similar. E. schroederi shared two features of the foot claws with the living Tokay gecko: the claws had expanded bottom ends; and the articulations between phalanges were simple concave-convex joints, instead of bicondylar (i.e. based on two rounded projections on the ends of the phalanges), unlike most other lizards. Classification Ardeosaurus has been found to either be closely related or distantly related to Eichstaettisaurus in various analyses The phylogenetic history of Eichstaettisaurus has been tumultuous like that of Ardeosaurus, which has been a consequence of both incomplete data and its primitive form. von Meyer did not provide a placement for Ardeosaurus when he named the genus; Richard Lydekker and Karl Alfred von Zittel placed it and Homoeosaurus in the Rhynchocephalia, Baron Franz Nopcsa placed Ardeosaurus as a close relative of the skinks, and Charles Camp placed it close to the Gekkonidae. Based on the well-developed rims of the eye sockets and supratemporal fenestrae on the skull in the type specimen of E. schroederi, Broili concurred with Nopcsa's conclusion in 1938. Within the Scincomorpha, he noted that the amphicoelous vertebrae of Ardeosaurus (including E. schroederi) best resembled that of the Xantusiidae (night lizards), as most other skinks have procoelous (convex on the rear surface) vertebrae. Upon separating schroederi into the genus Broilisaurus, Hoffstetter retained it within the Xantusiidae in 1953, but he noticed that its skull curiously resembled those of geckoes. Since xantusiids and geckoes were then placed on the two major recognized branches of lizards, Autarchoglossa and Ascalabota, Hoffstetter speculated that it was close to the ancestral stock of lizards. Upon renaming it to Eichstaettisaurus, Kuhn established the family Eichstaettisauridae, still in the Xantusiidae. In 1961 and then 1963, Cocude-Michel concurred with Camp that Ardeosauridae and Eichstaettisauridae were actually geckoes and not xantusiids, based on major differences in the postcranial skeleton, and placed both in the Gekkonomorpha. Hoffstetter accepted this identification in 1966, as did Richard Estes in 1983. However, phylogenetic analyses conducted by Victor Reynoso in 1996 (not published), Evans and Luis Javier Barbadillo in 1998 and 1999, and Evans and Daniel Chure in 1998 suggested that both Eichstaettisaurus and Ardeosaurus were much more basal (early-diverging) squamates. Along with Bavarisaurus, Scandensia, and Hoyalacerta, the two were found to fall outside the crown group of Squamata. This would make them stem- squamates, i.e. not descendants of the common ancestor of all living squamates. However, in the 1999 analysis, Evans and Barbadillo acknowledged that the position of Eichstaettisaurus was unstable due to missing data (only 44% of the characteristics used in their analysis could be coded for it), and one of their phylogenetic trees placed it as the sister group to Scleroglossa among crown squamates. Evans and colleagues found E. gouldi to be the sister group of E. schroederi in 2004, and recovered a similar position for both. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses from Evans and colleagues found a variety of conflicting positions for Eichstaettisaurus and Ardeosaurus. In 2005, Evans and Yuan Wang conducted two analyses, one based on a 1998 analysis by Michael Lee and the other based on Evans and Chure's 1998 analysis, but they added Dalinghosaurus, Dorsetisaurus, and Parviraptor to both. One found Eichstaettisaurus as the sister group of a group containing Xantusiidae, Gekkonidae, Pygopodidae, and Amphisbaenia, with Ardeosaurus being close to Lacertidae and Teiioidea; the other united Eichstaettisaurus with Dalinghosaurus and the Xenosauridae in the Anguimorpha, with Ardeosaurus as the sister group of Iguania. After Evans, Wang, and Chun Li added Yabeinosaurus to the same analyses, one found Eichstaettisaurus, Ardeosaurus, Yabeinosaurus, and Parviraptor to form the sister group to the Scleroglossa, while the other recovered Ardeosaurus as a stem-squamate and Eichstaettisaurus, Hoyalacerta, Parviraptor, and Scandensia to form a group among Scleroglossa. A 2006 phylogenetic analysis by Jack Conrad and Mark Norell likewise found Eichstaettisaurus as close to the Scleroglossa. In 2008, Conrad published a large phylogenetic analysis of squamates including 222 taxa and 363 characteristics, which attempted to address the problem of incomplete taxon sampling (i.e. an insufficient number of included taxa) causing phylogenetic instability. To include Eichstaettisaurus, he combined data from E. schroederi and E. gouldi. He found that both Eichstaettisaurus and Ardeosaurus, along with Bavarisaurus, were part of the stem group of Scleroglossa. Along with the crown group of Scleroglossa, they comprised the Scincogekkonomorpha. Arnau Bolet and Evans conducted two analyses based on Conrad's analysis, for the 2010 and 2012 descriptions of Pedrerasaurus and Jucaraseps, and recovered similar positions for Eichstaettisaurus. However, the former contained a polytomy since the relationship between Iguania, Pedrerasaurus, a group containing Ardeosaurus, Yabeinosaurus, and Sakurasaurus, and all other squamates could not be resolved. Jacques Gauthier and colleagues published another large phylogenetic analysis in 2012, containing 192 taxa and 976 characteristics. Like Conrad, they also combined data from E. schroederi and E. gouldi. They recovered a more derived position for Eichstaettisaurus as part of the stem group of Gekkota, along with the unnamed specimen AMNH FR 21444; in particular, they noted that its limb proportions strongly resembled gekkotans. After adding Ardeosaurus digitatellus and re-coding Eichstaettisaurus to only include data from E. schroederi, Sim√µes and colleagues found E. schroederi in a similar position, albeit in a polytomy with A. digitatellus and AMNH FR 21444. They identified a number of gekkotan traits: the paired parietals; the closed Meckelian groove on the lower jaw; the small, conical maxillary teeth; the short, blunt snout and flattened skull; the ectopterygoids overlapping the pterygoids; the two pterygoids and palatine bones being widely separated; the wide suture dividing the pterygoids and palatines from each other; and the lumbar-like vertebrae. In 2018, Mateusz Ta≈Çanda added Ardeosaurus brevipes to Gauthier and colleagues' analysis (but did not include the revisions of Sim√µes and colleagues). He found Eichstaettisaurus in the same location alongside Norellius, but also recovered A. brevipes as a scincomorph closely related to skinks (in contrast to the stem-gekkotan position of A. digitatellus). Despite their different phylogenetic positions, Ta≈Çanda observed that the two species only differ by the widths of their parietals. He speculated that incomplete data due to the poor preservation of A. digitatellus could have influenced these results, and thus he retained it in the genus Ardeosaurus. Another analysis conducted by Sim√µes, Ta≈Çanda, and colleagues in 2018, this time using the revised data of Sim√µes and colleagues, found a similar position for E. schroederi but a more basal one for A. brevipes in the Autarchoglossa. In 2019, Vladimir Alifanov considered both Eichstaettisaurus and Ardeosaurus as scincomorphs closely related to Carusia but not to Xenosauridae, but did not perform a phylogenetic analysis. Below, phylogenetic trees from the two major phylogenetic analyses including Eichstaettisaurus are shown: one based on that of Conrad (Bolet & Evans, 2012, with relationships within Scleroglossa from Conrad, 2008), and one based on that of Gauthier and colleagues (Sim√µes and colleagues, 2018). Topology A: Bolet & Evans (2012) with Scleroglossa from Conrad (2008) Topology B: Sim√µes et al. (2018) Paleobiology The bodyplan of Eichstaettisaurus has been compared to the Tokay gecko Modern geckoes are unusual among lizards in that the digits of their limbs are relatively symmetrical in length, and are splayed in a broad arc; by contrast, the digits in other lizards are usually nearly parallel to each other, especially on the feet. The pattern seen in geckoes facilitates gripping while the body is in various orientations, since it spreads out the adhesive setae (bristles) on their toepads while allowing the first and last digits to oppose each other. Eichstaettisaurus schroederi exhibited two characteristics that contributed to foot symmetry: its first metatarsal was long relative to its third metatarsal (with the third metatarsal only being 1.41 times as long as the first, as opposed to 2 times in a typical lizard), and its fourth metatarsal was relatively short. In 2017, Sim√µes and colleagues observed that E. schroederi had stronger foot symmetry than Ardeosaurus digitatellus, and they inferred that the feet of both were likely directed further forwards than other lizards. This was also supported by the lack of bicondylar articulations in the phalanges, which are an adaptation for outwards-facing feet that resists displacement in the horizontal plane while enabling flexion in the vertical plane. Sim√µes and colleagues also identified several other characteristics in E. schroederi, which suggest that the scansorial (climbing-based) lifestyles of modern geckoes arose earlier than previously appreciated. Its tall claws and elongate second-from-tip phalanges on the digits are both traits that have been strongly correlated with scansorial lifestyles in lizards. In particular, the tall claws may have provided longer lever arms for the flexor tendons that retracts them, thus improving their gripping strength. Meanwhile, its relatively short limbs and flattened body may have improved climbing performance by lowering its centre of gravity, as has been suggested for the Tokay gecko, but this feature may not be correlated with scansorial lifestyles. Finally, its limbs of similar lengths may have improved grip as in the sharp-snouted rock lizard; the significance of this trait may be diminished given the adhesive toepads of geckoes, and the lack of correlation between limb length ratio and scansoriality in the Lacertidae. In 2004, Evans and colleagues had also discussed the lifestyle of E. gouldi in light of its bodily proportions. They pointed to a previous study on how variation between proportions among species of snow skinks (Carinascincus) was correlated with habitat usage: short torsos and long hindlimbs were correlated with rock climbing (in large species) and tree climbing (in small species), while long torsos and shorter hindlimbs were correlated with ground dwelling. Evans and colleagues found that E. gouldi was closest to the ground-dwelling species, which have slow running speeds and are relatively poor climbers, in its proportions. Nevertheless, they recognized that the flat bodies and tall claws of E. gouldi were adapted for clinging to rough surfaces. They proposed a hybrid lifestyle for E. gouldi: a slow-moving ground lizard with some capacity for climbing on rocks and hiding in crevices from predators like rhynchocephalians. Paleoecology E. schroederi Stratigraphy of the Solnhofen limestones The rock units at Wintershof that produced the only known specimen of E. schroederi are part of the Solnhofen limestones of southern Germany, which are well known for their exceptionally preserved fossils. Historically, the stratigraphy of the Solnhofen limestones has been the subject of considerable confusion, with the variety of environments and depositional patterns contributing to the confusion. They are now understood to consist of several geological formations in the Wei√üjura Group: in the strictest sense, they consist of the Altm√ºhltal Formation to the northwest of Ingolstadt (including localities around Eichst√§tt), and the Painten Formation to the northeast of Ingolstadt. Within the Altm√ºhltal Formation, the Wintershof quarry is part of the Upper Eichst√§tt Member, which in terms of ammonite biostratigraphy lies in the Euvirgalithacoceras eigeltingense-Œ≤ horizon between the Lithacoceras riedense and Hybonoticeras hybonotum subzones. The deposits of the Altm√ºhltal Formation, which have been dated to the lower Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period, consist of plattenkalk (very finely-grained limestone-based muds such as micrite) forming even, thin layers measuring about thick that generally lack evidence of bioturbation (disturbance by living organisms). During the Tithonian, the plattenkalk of the Altm√ºhltal Formation was deposited in oceanic basins (called \\"wannen\\") within a warm, shallow sea surrounding an archipelago. These basins, which may have been lagoons, had a palaeolatitude of approximately 34¬∞ N, and were located at the northern margin of the Tethys Ocean. Fossils of bottom-dwelling animals like brittle stars and gastropods are virtually absent, which suggests that conditions at the sea floor were inhospitable to life; this may have been caused by one of several factors including hypersalinity, oxygen depletion, or the accumulation of toxic hydrogen sulfide. These conditions were responsible for the exceptional preservation of fossils like that of E. schroederi, which would have been predominantly transported from the surrounding land during heavy rainfall and storms. On land, the absence of ferns and the dominance of dry-adapted conifers suggest that the climate was semi-arid. The Eichst√§tt specimen of Archaeopteryx Both Ardeosaurus brevipes and A. digitatellus were discovered at Wintershof with E. schroederi, along with Homoeosaurus maximiliani and the rhynchocephalian Pleurosaurus goldfussi. Also known from Wintershof are the pterosaur Rhamphorhynchus muensteri, the crocodyliform Alligatorellus bavaricus, and various aquatic animals: the fish Anaethalion angustus, Ascalabos voithii, Aspidorhynchus acutirostris, Belonostomus spyraenoides, Caturus giganteus, Gyrodus circularis, Macrosemius rostratus, Palaeomacrosemius thiollieri, Propterus elongatus, and Zandtfuro tischlingeri; the angelshark Pseudorhina alifera; the squid-like coleoids Acanthoteuthis problematica, Belemnotheutis mayri, and Plesioteuthis prisca; the crinoid Saccocoma tenella, which is very common in Solnhofen deposits; the shrimp Dusa reschi; and the horseshoe crab Mesolimulus walchi. Nearby quarries have produced the Eichst√§tt specimen of the avialan dinosaur Archaeopteryx lithographica, and the pterosaurs Aerodactylus scolopaciceps, Germanodactylus cristatus, and possibly Cycnorhamphus. E. gouldi E. gouldi was found in the plattenkalk deposits of Pietraroia (middle ground) The Pietraroia locality, from where E. gouldi specimens are known, is formed by a plattenkalk outcrop at the top of a rock slope (the \\"Civita di Pietraroia\\") located at the eastern margin of the Matese Mountains. These mountains did not start to form until the Miocene, with the majority of the tectonic uplift that brought them to their current elevation having occurred between the Pliocene and the Pleistocene. At the locality, there are two distinct plattenkalk beds; the lower bed is coarser-grained and is largely devoid of fossils, while the upper bed is muddier and is the source of most fossils. The two beds are separated by lagoonal limestones. The plattenkalk is formed by layers of packstone and grainstone measuring thick, which alternate with layers of mudstone, wackestone, and marl; the upper bed is also characterized by the presence of sponge spicules, chert, bitumen, and coprolites. On the basis of foraminiferans, the Pietaroia locality has been dated to the Albian epoch of the Early Cretaceous. During this time, the plattenkalk of Pietraroia would have been laid down in a shallow water carbonate platform close to a small island. The depositional environment was originally thought to have been a lagoon, but it has been re-interpreted as an east-flowing underwater channel that was gradually filled during the Aptian, based on patterns in the arrangement of fossils, the water currents, and the transportation of sediments. The lack of bioturbation likewise points to an anoxic environment, possibly related to a global oceanic anoxic event. Some fossils are well preserved while others were nearly destroyed, suggesting that they originated from various locations, with terrestrial animals like E. gouldi being brought into the channel by freshwater flows. The climate would have been tropical to subtropical. Scipionyx samniticus is a well known fossil from Pietraroia In addition to E. gouldi and the rhynchocephalian MPN A01/82, other lepidosaurs from Pietraroia include the lizards Chometokadmon fitzingeri and Costasaurus rusconi, and the rhynchocephalian Derasmosaurus pietraroiae as well as a third unnamed juvenile specimen. The most well known fossil from Pietraroia is that of the compsognathid dinosaur Scipionyx samniticus, which preserves soft tissues including internal organs. Other reptiles include two crocodyliform specimens belonging to Pietraroiasuchus ormezzanoi, and the albanerpetontid amphibian Celtedens megacephalus. Many fish are known from Pietraroia, with the most common being a pycnodontid formerly identified as Coelodus costae but now known as Gregoriopycnodus bassanii. Others include Anaethalion robustus, Belonostomus crassirostris, Caeus leopoldi, Cavinichthys pietrarojae, Chirocentrites coroninii, relatives of Diplomystus brevissimus and Elopopsis fenzii, Hemieloposis gibbus, Ionoscopus petrarojae, Italophiopsis derasmoi, a species of Lepidotes, Notagogus pentlandi, Pleuropholis decastroi, Propterus scacchii, and Sauropsidium laevissimum. Cartilaginous fish included the angelshark Phorcynis and the ray Rhinobatus obtusatus. Invertebrates included rudists, bivalves, sea snails of the genus Nerinea, shrimp, and starfish.

Her writings ranged through a wide variety of themes. Born in 1812, in Massachusetts, she began composing verse at an early age, but published little till after her marriage. Thereafter, she wrote much for various reviews and other miscellanies, besides several volumes of tales, sketches, and essays. She also made numerous translations from German literature, in prose and verse, in which she evinced an appreciation of the original. Sawyer's poems were numerous, sufficient for several volumes, though they were not published as a collection. Early years and education Caroline Mehitable Fisher was born in Newton, Massachusetts, December 10, 1812. She was relataed to the Gores, Danas, Gridleys, Foxcrofts and Kendricks, and was a descendant of Thomas Cranmer. Sawyer's maternal grandfather (with whom she lived with a widowed mother and a highly educated but invalid uncle) was John Kendrick, who commanded a company at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and was a conscientious Abolitionist. At a Baptist Sunday school, where the Bible and Isaac Watts' hymns were committed to memory, Sawyer recited the first eight chapters of the Gospel of Mark when she was just eight years old. Before the age of ten, she had read Shakespeare, John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, Plutarch's Parallel Lives, as well as Hume's and Smollett's History of England. At school, after eating lunch, she would improvise stories of knights and ladies, fairies and hobgoblins, for her fellow students. This continued until the invalid uncle, whose life had been passed in pursuits of science and literature, removed her from the country school to his own supervision. She was then carefully and thoroughly educated at home. Soon after this, he prepared an herbarium of the hundreds of wild plants of New England growing within of Boston, for the Royal Botanical Society of Edinburgh, Scotland; in all these collections and preparations, the uncle instructed Sawyer in the science of nature. Sawyer was also educated in French and German, as well as history and mythology. Career Sawyer started writing when very young. The \\"Burlington Sentinel\\" published her first poem. Young as she was, she was a welcome contributor to the \\"Sentinel,\\" and afterward to the \\"Boston Evening Gazette\\" and \\" Democratic Review.\\" In September 1831, she married Rev. Thomas J. Sawyer, D.D., the pastor of Orchard Street Church, in New York City. At the end of about 15 years Rev. Sawyer was chosen president of Clinton Liberal Institute, Universalist seminary at Clinton, Oneida County, New York, and they moved to that town upon his assumption of the office. Sawyer was one of the most prolific writers of Christian Universalism denominational literature. During Sawyer's 25 years in New York, she was constantly recording writing. She was a contributor to \\"Graham's Magazine,\\" the \\"Knickerbocker Magazine\\", and the \\"Democratic Review\\". For several years, she was a constant contributor to the \\"Odd Fellows' Magazine,\\" published in Baltimore, Maryland; and for Horace Greeley's \\"New Yorker\\". Park Benjamin Sr., opened the door into the \\"New World\\" for Sawyer. Her stories, essays and poems were excellent. Her translations from the French and German were graceful. Sawyer became editor of the \\"Rose of Sharon\\" in 1849; she was a constant contributor from its first appearance, in 1840, during Sarah Carter Edgarton Mayo's editorship. In 1860, she became editor of \\"The Ladies' Repository\\". For several years, she was editor of the youth's department in the \\"Christian Messenger\\", as well as the \\"Universalist Union\\" (1835‚Äì47). Personal life In 1881, Thomas J. Sawyer, D.D., was Packard Professor of Theology in Tufts College, and Dean of the Department of Divinity. She died May 19, 1894 in Somerville, Massachusetts and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He was known as \\"Gurg\\" (\\"the wolf\\").  Military conquests  After other generals of Alauddin failed to capture the Siwana fort in the preceding years, in 1308, he personally led an expedition to Siwana. Kamal al-Din accompanied Alauddin in this campaign, and held charge of the siege engines (munjaniqs). After the Delhi army captured the fort, it was renamed Khayrabad, and assigned to Kamal al-Din. In 1311, Alauddin sent an army to capture Siwana's neighbour Jalore. After his other generals failed to capture the fort, he dispatched Kamal al-Din to conquer it. Kamalauddin captured the fort after a siege that resulted in the deaths of the defending ruler Kanhadadeva and his son Viramadeva. After this victory, Kamal al-Din held the iqta' of Jalor.  Last days  During the last days of Alauddin's reign, Kamal al-Din allied with Alauddin's slave-general Malik Kafur, who held the executive power during Alauddin's sickness. The two men were probably part of a group of non-Khalaj officers that tried to seize power from the Khalaj establishment of the Sultanate. According to the chronicler Yahya bin Ahmad Sirhindi, in 1315, Kamal al-Din participated in Malik Kafur's murder of Alp Khan, an influential rival nobleman and the governor of Gujarat. Alp Khan had been accused of conspiring to kill Alauddin, but this may have been Kafur's propaganda. The news of Alp Khan's murder led to a revolt in Gujarat, and Kafur sent Kamal al-Din to suppress the revolt.

The salience network (SN) is a large scale brain network of the human brain that is primarily composed of the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). It is involved in detecting and filtering salient stimuli, as well as in recruiting relevant functional networks. Together with its interconnected brain networks, the SN contributes to a variety of complex functions, including communication, social behavior, and self-awareness through the integration of sensory, emotional, and cognitive information.Menon V. (2015) Salience Network. In: Arthur W. Toga, editor. Brain Mapping: An Encyclopedic Reference, vol. 2, pp. 597-611. Academic Press: Elsevier. https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/scsnl/documents/Menon_Salience_Network_15.pdf The network is detectable through independent component analysis of resting state fMRI images, as well as seed based functional connectivity analysis. In addition to the AI and dACC, the salience network also consists of the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum, amygdala, dorsomedial thalamus, and hypothalamus. The functional connectivity has been linked with structural connectivity through diffusion tensor imaging, which reveals white matter tracts between the AI and dACC. Anatomy The salience network is primarily anchored at the AI and dACC. The node in the AI corresponds with the dorsal-anterior division distinguished in meta analyses of task-positive network related neuroimaging studies. The AI and dACC are linked via a white matter tract along the uncinate fasciculus. The subcortical nodes have yet to be structurally linked to the AI and dACC, however both seed-based and resting-state studies have observed intrinsic connectivity of the cortical nodes, with subcortical nodes consisting of the sublenticular extended amygdala, the putamen, the dorsomedial thalamus, the ventral striatum, and the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area. The salience network is also distinguished by distinct cellular components, including von Economo neurons in the AI/dACC. Cortico-striatal-thalamic loop circuits contribute to the salience network. Function While the function of the salience network is not exactly known, it has been implicated in the detection and integration of emotional and sensory stimuli, as well as in modulating the switch between the internally directed cognition of the default mode network and the externally directed cognition of the central executive network. Evidence that the salience network mediates a switch between the DMN and CEN comes from Granger causality analysis and studies utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation. The timing of electrophysiological responses during the oddball task is consistent with interaction, as after the initial mismatch negativity response is transmitted \\"bottom-up\\" from sensory regions, a \\"top- down\\" signal localized to the AI and dACC occurs before a widespread evoked potential that corresponds to attentional shifting. Pathophysiology Dysfunction in the salience network have been observed in various psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. The AI node of the salience network has been observed to be hyperactive in anxiety disorders, which is thought to reflect predictions of aversive bodily states leading to worrisome thoughts and anxious behaviors. In schizophrenia, both structural and functional abnormalities have been observed, thought to reflect excessive salience being ascribed to internally generated stimuli. In individuals with autism, the relative salience of social stimuli, such as face, eyes, and gaze, may be diminished, leading to poor social skills.  Nomenclature  The cingulo-opercular network (CO) has generally been equated with the salience network, but it may represent a distinct but adjacent network or a part of the SN. The CO may involve more dorsal areas, while the SN involves more ventral and rostral areas of the anterior insula and medial frontal cortex containing von Economo neurons. The CO is sometimes also referred to as the cingulo-insular network. The ventral attention network (VAN), also known as the ventral frontoparietal network (VFN) or ventral attention system (VAS), has also been equated with the SN. The VAN involves the temporoparietal junction and the ventral frontal cortex and may represent a larger, more bilateral network with more of an external awareness role than the SN. It has been described as including the SN and CO, but it has also been described as a part of the salience network involving the more dorsal anterior insular cortex.

History The NWPA was founded on May 13, 1884, at the World Cotton Centennial in New Orleans, Louisiana. Its aim was not only to be of practical assistance to newspaper writers, but ultimately, \\"to advance the interest of all professional, business, and working women of every grade.\\" The association was founded by Marion A. McBride, a journalist with the Boston Post who was serving as superintendent of the press for the Women's Department. McBride planned to model its organization on that of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, with every state in the union represented. The first president was Eliza Jane Nicholson, publisher of the New Orleans Picayune. Vice presidents were Lilla Stone Pavy of the Missouri Republican, Florence M. Adkinson of the Chicago Inter Ocean and the Indianapolis Sentinel, and Mary McMillen of the Anglo American. McBride was the first secretary. By 1885 the association had over 300 members. Regional chapters included the Illinois Woman's Press Association (still in existence), the New England Woman's Press Association, the Missouri Woman's Press Association, the Indiana Woman's Press Association, the Ohio Woman's Press Association, and the Southern Woman's Press Association.

The episode was written by Joe Ainsworth and directed by Jan Bauer, and premiered on BBC One on 19 September 2017. The episode features the wedding of established characters Zosia March (Camilla Arfwedson) and Oliver Valentine (James Anderson), who both work on the show's fictitious Darwin ward. It formed the first of a two-part collective of episodes leading up to Arfwedson's departure from the series. The episode also featured Zosia's father Guy Self (John Michie) ruining her wedding day, getting drunk and falling on a shard of glass. Other characters battle in the operating theatre to save his life. While registrar Dominic Copeland (David Ames) and nurse Ben \\"Lofty\\" Chiltern (Lee Mead) sleep together forming part of their ongoing gay storyline. Location filming was done at Brocket Hall, a Grade I-listed classical English country house. Arfwedson described the episode as \\"such a romantic episode\\" and that it was a fun process to create. The episode was promoted by the BBC with trailers airing on their website and televised segments on BBC1. The episode was watched by 4.3 million people during the BBC One airing. Plot The episode follows the wedding day of ST3 doctor Zosia March (Camilla Arfwedson) and registrar Oliver Valentine (James Anderson). Zosia's father Guy Self (John Michie) attends a meeting with CEO Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) and medical director Nina Karnik (Ayesha Dharker). They inform him that Guy is suspended for being under the influence of alcohol in the operating theatre. Nina asks consultant cardiothoracic surgeon Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) to review all medical cases involving Guy to find possible errors. Nina then orders Jac to send a patient home waiting for a pioneering cosmetic procedure. She argues that the hospital is short staffed, needs beds and no negative attention. Nina talks to the patient and changes her mind, opting to assist Jac on the operation. Guy attends the wedding venue where he tries to make amends with Zosia. She initially forgives him, but orders him to leave when she realises he is manipulating her. Zosia's best friend, registrar Dominic Copeland (David Ames), walks her down the aisle and she marries Oliver. Guy drinks a bottle of whisky and destroys the wedding cake. He proceeds to make speech criticising his daughter and ruining their reception. Nurse Ben \\"Lofty\\" Chiltern (Lee Mead) puts Guy in a guest room to sleep, but Guy smashes glasses and bottles in the room. Dom's boyfriend Freddie Chapel (Aaron Fontaine) complains that the wedding is boring and abruptly leaves. An upset Dom is mean to Lofty who offers his support. He later goes to Lofty's room to apologise and kisses him. The pair sleep together unaware of trouble unfolding outside. Zosia finds Guy unconscious in the guest room. He has taken an overdose and fallen on a shard of glass. He is rushed to hospital where Jac and Nina battle to save his life. They manage to resuscitate him and remove the shard of glass. He has to have his spleen removed and is stabilised. Oliver tries to comfort Zosia who seems disinterested in him, as she sits by her father's bedside. Production The episode features scenes filmed at Brocket Hall.The episode features Zosia and Oliver's wedding as the main story. The episode was highly anticipated by fans of the two characters. Arfwedson believed viewers were \\"terribly excited\\" because they wanted the pair finally achieve happiness together following difficult times. Holby City producer Kate Hall told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that \\"the 'Zollie' wedding is a fascinating story about a young woman, the pressures she has faced through her diagnosis, and the very complex relationship she has with her father.\\" \\"Veil of Tears ‚Äì Part One\\" was written by Joe Ainsworth and directed by Jan Bauer. Zosia and Oliver's wedding was filmed on location at Brocket Hall, a Grade I-listed classical country house set in a large park near Hatfield in Hertfordshire, England. Of her experience of filming there, Arfwedson told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that \\"it was so much fun and such a romantic episode.\\" Lee Mead who plays Lofty was written into the episode. The actress also found it strange that he was attending her character's wedding when she had never worked with Mead on-screen before. In addition Anderson found filming the wedding scenes to be \\"weird\\" because he was about to marry in real life. He married off-screen within twenty-four hours of the episode being broadcast. Arfwedson told Victoria Wilson from What's on TV that the episode features her character as \\"quite a lonely figure, pacing around this grand house\\". This is because she has cancelled many of the wedding guests' invitations due to her argument with Guy. The episode was also one of a two-part collective of episodes, with the following episode titled \\"Veil of Tears ‚Äì Part Two\\". These episodes formed the lead up to Arfwedson's departure from the series. The actress told What's on TV that it was \\"nice to have this big wedding\\" episode leading to her exit. She described filming the two parts as \\"very full on and quite exhausting\\". Promotion In August 2017, Hall stated that the episode would be one of the show's \\"biggest of the year\\". She praised all the main cast's acting performance in the episode and promoted it as \\"a brilliant, brilliant episode.\\" On 5 September 2017, scenes from the wedding were publicised via a trailer previewing the show's stories due to air in late 2017. The show's official website later released a teaser trailer featuring scenes involving Jac and Nina to promote the episode. The BBC also aired a televised trailer to promote the episode. It was broadcast on 19 September 2017 on BBC One in the United Kingdom. Reception The episode was watched by 4.33 million people during the BBC One airing. Twenty-eight days later, the episode's rating continued to increase, to a new total of 4.52 million viewers. \\"Veil of Tears ‚Äì Part One\\" saw a decrease of 30,000 viewers in the overall rating figures from the previous episode. The following episode decreased to 4.32 million viewers. TVTimes included the episode in their \\"pick of the day\\" feature and gave it a three star rating. Their reporter opined \\"it's Oliver and Zosia's big day! Well, when we say big day, we mean a rather pitiful affair with just a handful of guests and no string quartet, photographer, bad disco or drunk bridesmaids.\\" A What's on TV reporter branded it a \\"nightmare wedding\\" and said that Guy made it \\"one to remember - for all the wrong reasons.\\" Another said it was their \\"wedding nightmare\\" and \\"Zosia certainly doesn‚Äôt look like a woman about to marry the man of her dreams. A reporter from Soaplife included it in their \\"Must see TV\\" feature.

A writer for the Inside Soap Yearbook 2018 included the ceremony in their \\"Wedding Gloom\\" feature for the month of September.

It was produced by Mike Thorne and would be the band's last studio album before their split in 1991. Background After signing to Stiff in 1986, Furniture achieved their commercial breakthrough with the single \\"Brilliant Mind\\", which reached No. 21 in the UK. However, both the follow-up single \\"Love Your Shoes\\" and the parent album The Wrong People failed to continue this success due to Stiff's financial difficulties. The label went into liquidation and was subsequently sold to ZTT, leaving the band to spend the next two years freeing themselves from their contract. Meanwhile, the band were able to spend time touring with the British Council in countries such as Cyprus, Turkey, Romania and Czechoslovakia. In 1989, having cleared the legal issues with their ZZT contract, the band signed to Arista. They recorded Food, Sex & Paranoia at Wessex Sound Studios and the Stereo Society. Preceding the album was the single \\"Slow Motion Kisses\\", which was released in October, but failed to chart. A second single, \\"One Step Behind You\\", suffered a similar fate upon release in February 1990. The album was released that same month, but was not a commercial success and saw limited promotion from Arista. By the time of its release, the label had undergone a major reshuffling of their A&R; department, which had resulted in the sacking of the team who had signed Furniture to the label. Food, Sex & Paranoia sold approximately 5,000 copies. The band embarked on a UK tour during February‚ÄìMarch to promote the album.http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/7OQAAOSw5cNYMfow/s-l1600.jpg After the album's commercial failure, the band were dropped from Arista and returned to their former label Survival. They continued to tour during 1990-91, though keyboardist Maya Gilder left the band in 1990. They performed at the Reading Festival in 1990 and released the compilation She Gets Out The Scrapbook: The Best of Furniture in 1991. A new album was planned, however the closure of Survival Studios ultimately led the band to split that same year. \\"One Step Behind You\\" was covered in 1992 by German singer Marian Gold (of Alphaville fame) for his album So Long Celeste. Critical reception Upon release, High Fidelity News and Record Review said: \\"Bleak Stuff, the kind usually inspired by reading too many street fashion magazines or believing all the nonsense written about The Velvets. The title hits two out of three but destroys the equation; maybe this mob should watch Tom Jones instead of The Cook, The Thief, His Wife etc.\\" Robin Denselow of The Guardian described the album as \\"a set of varied, oddball emotional mood songs\\". He added: \\"There are thoughtful, gently-pounding dramatic ballads matched with rumbling keyboards or swirling Arabic and Eastern effects, along with muted galloping rockers with low-key vocals. They are not an obvious commercial success, but deserve to survive because of their original material.\\"The Guardian - Records: Rock/pop - Robin Denselow - 15 March 1990 - page 24 Steve Hochman of Los Angeles Times commented: \\"Rather than politics, Furniture's obsessions are all romantic - actually, about the emotionally fatal, all-consuming side of romance. But the co-ed quintet's music is at times as haunting as McCarthy's, sometimes reminiscent of Prefab Sprout or Deacon Blue, though often more textually inventive and dynamic.\\" In his book The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music, Colin Larkin described the album as \\"overlooked\\" and one that \\"should have resurrected their career\\".

Biography Luis de Egu√≠laz was a disciple of the humanist and unfrocked friar Juan Mar√≠a Capit√°n. He found his dramatic vocation early; at age 14 he premiered the one-act comedy Por dinero baila el perro in Jerez de la Frontera. He studied law in Madrid and began his literary career with a critical study of the novel Clemencia by Fern√°n Caballero.

There is an oil portrait of Luis de Egu√≠laz in the Ateneo de Sanl√∫car de Barrameda. Works Luis de Egu√≠laz's dramatic works are vigorously conceived, with well-defined characters, but have an excessive and perhaps inflexible lyricism. His theater is that of traditionalist ideology, and indoctrinates through the procedures of costumbrismo. His works can be divided into three groups: # Semi-historical works with lyrical features, such as Las querellas del rey Sabio (1858), where he utilizes a good imitation of the medieval fabla; El patriarca del Turia (1874), in which he refers to the writer ; La vaquera de la Finojosa (1874), inspired by the famous serranilla of √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza; El caballero del milagro, where he dramatizes the life of the baroque writer Agust√≠n de Rojas Villandrando; Los dos camaradas, in which Miguel de Cervantes and John of Austria are the main characters; Miguel de Cervantes, the first part of which was left without an ending by at his death, which Egu√≠laz finished and added a dramatic one-act proem titled \\"Un hallazgo literario\\" which explains the genesis of the work; Alarc√≥n (1853), about the Mexican playwright Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n; Una aventura de Tirso (1855), about the celebrated comedy writer Gabriel T√©llez; Una broma de Quevedo; Cuando ahorcaron a Quevedo; Lope de Rueda; etc. # Works of moralizing and practical tenor, such as Mentiras dulces (1859), Verdades amargas (1853), Los soldados de plomo (1865), La cruz del matrimonio (1860; his greatest success), Grazalema, Quiero y no puedo, La vida de Juan Soldado, etc. # Zarzuela librettos: El salto del pasiego (1878; posthumous, with music by Manuel Fern√°ndez Caballero), El molinero de Subiza (1870; music by Crist√≥bal Oudrid, undoubtedly his greatest success in this genre), El esclavo (1857), etc. Notes References Further reading 1830 births 1874 deaths 19th-century Spanish dramatists and playwrights People from Sanl√∫car de Barrameda Spanish lawyers ","title":"Luis de Egu√≠laz"},{"id":"55279546","text":"The South African Gymnastics Federation is the overall governing body of the sports of gymnastics in South Africa.

She wrote and lectured in the causes of temperance and women's rights. She was the first woman of northern New York to embrace woman suffrage. Her poetry appeared in the Springfield \\"Republican,\\" Boston \\"Transcript,\\" the \\"Overland Monthly\\" and other prominent journals. Her volume of poems, A Dream of the Adirondacks, and Other Poems (New York City, 1884), was compiled by Charles G. Whiting. Her Madame de Stael had the endorsement of eminent scholars as a literary lecture. Her \\"Grand Armies\\" was considered a brilliant Memorial Day address. She excelled in poems of affection. Her \\"Justice in Leadville,\\" in the style of Bret Harte, was pronounced by The Spectator to be worthy of that poet or of John Hay. Early years and education Helen Hinsdale was born June 18, 1827, in Antwerp, New York. Her father, Ira Hinsdale, was a pioneer farmer who had migrated from Berkshire County, Massachusetts. On her father's side she was a relative of Emma Willard. She was born in a log cabin on the farm he cleared in 1821. Her mother died in 1879. She ran away to school at the age of four. At 12 years of age, she wrote verses. Though she attended only a single term, she led her classes in the Gouverneur Wesleyan Seminary, and won prizes in composition. She became proficient in botany at the age of 13 in the woods on the farm. She was obliged to read all debates of the United States Congress aloud to her father, and the speeches of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster made her an ardent patriot and politician. She was a Universalist. Career She married Moses Rich, July 4, 1847. He was a manufacturer of Brasher Falls, New York. She found time to write several hundred poems and a vast amount of prose, including stories, lectures, and addresses. Most of her studying has been done in spite of engrossing home cares since marriage. She was with Professor J. S. Lee, of Canton, New York, for several months in her 37th year. Her poems had a wide circulation in the periodical press; but her chief productions, poems of great length, were never published. Rich was a contributor to the Rose of Sharon, Lily of the Valley, Ladies' Repository, Overland Monthly, New York Tribune, Chicago Tribune, Detroit Tribune, New Covenant, Star in the West, Springfield Republican, Burlington Hawkeye, Boston Transcript, Boston Commonwealth, Woman's Journal, Universalist, Christian Leader, and many other periodical publications. Rich was a temperance worker, and her lectures upon that subject were characterized as persuasive and of high literary merit. For two seasons, she gave lectures for the Union cause in the American Civil War. She was a defender of woman's right to assist in making the laws that govern her. She carried out her ideas of woman's ability and need of personal achievement, self-support and self-reliance in the rearing of her daughter. Personal life Rich made her home is in Chicago, Illinois. She had one daughter, Mrs. D. C. Lyon, of St. Joseph, Missouri, a musician; and a son, Pitt C. Rich, of Chicago. She died September 4, 1915 in St. Joseph, Missouri, and is buried in that city's Mount Mora Cemetery. Style and themes Rich's verse was characterized as \\"fluent and graceful, and she expresses emotion with that impress of genuineness and honesty which carries a personal force into the verse. She is deeply engaged in moral motives, and these fill many of her best poems with an inspiring fervor. But she also has the feeling of pure beauty\\". Her work as an interpreter of nature and humanity was compared to Lucy Larcom and Julia C. R. Dorr.

The 1944 National Title Game was played on March 28, 1944, and it was played at the Madison Square Garden, New York, New York. Background Utah The Utah Redskins were coached by Vadal Peterson, and this was the Utes' first and only National Championship. The team had only 9 lettermen, 7 of which were freshmen, including eventual All-American Arnie Ferrin. They went 22-4 that season, but would not have qualified for the tournament had the Arkansas team not been involved in an automobile accident that killed an assistant coach and a player. The Redskins were invited to replace the Razorbacks a mere two days before the tournament was set to commence. They would beat Missouri and then go on to beat Iowa State to win the championship. The Redskins would not go to another National Championship game until 1998 in which they lost. Utah was the first team to be in the National Invitation Tournament and the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament both in the same season. Utah was an Independent that year. Dartmouth The Dartmouth Indians were led by Earl Brown to their second and final National Championship appearance. Dartmouth beat Catholic University, and then faced off Ohio State until they got to the championship. The Indians went 19‚Äì2 that year. Dartmouth was and is still part of the Ivy League. The Indians were led by All-American Aud Brindley and experienced significant roster turnover due to World War II. The Indians lost lettermen Larry Killick, Joe Fater, Larry Baxter, John Monahan and Paul Campbell to the draft, but added standout players Dick McGuire of St. John's and Bob Gale of Cornell, who were transferred to Dartmouth as a part of their military training program. Game summary With 17,990 fans watching the game in New York, Utah hung tight with Dartmouth, who was favored by eight points prior to the game. For the first time in NCAA Championship Game history, an overtime period was required to determine a winner. Such overtime would not happen again until 1957. https://utahcommhistory.com/2010/04/30/university-of- utah-1944-ncaa-basketball-championship/ See also * 1944 NCAA Basketball Tournament References NCAA Basketball Championship Game NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Games Dartmouth Big Green men's basketball Utah Utes men's basketball Basketball in New York City College sports in New York City Sports competitions in New York City NCAA Basketball Championship Game March 1944 sports events ","title":"1944 NCAA Basketball Championship Game"},{"id":"55280195","text":" Michelle Winters is a Canadian writer, translator and artist.\\"Road- trip books combine destiny and destination\\".

Sashikanth is an Indian film producer, architect and entrepreneur from Chennai, India. After studying architecture at university, Sashikanth established the Chennai-based design firm Space Scape in 2002, which became involved in major projects such as the British Council and other residential and corporate building designs. Sashikanth later shifted to film production through the establishment of a production studio, Y NOT Studios, and the 2010 release of his first film, Thamizh Padam. Sashikanth's stated goal has been to see himself as having a creative role; Behindwoods has characterized him as a producer of \\"gutsy new-wave cinema\\", while The Hindu acknowledged his films Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi, Thamizh Padam, and Va as being \\"three of the most creative films in recent times\\". Career  Architecture  Alongside University of Sydney graduate Manoj Kumar, Sashikanth helped co- found the website StudentConcepts.com, which offered a suite of services for students, including loyalty programmes and job search tools. Sashikanth then continued as a student of architecture, but took an extended break from the subject after failing his first thesis. As a result of his interest in filmmaking, he was selected to assist art director Thotta Tharani with his sets on the production of Shankar's political thriller Mudhalvan (1999). After working on the sets for three months, he briefly dabbled in mango farming, before choosing to continue his studies in architecture, which he then passed as the university topper. Sashikanth subsequently set up an architectural company, Space Scape, with his wife Rajani in 2002. The couple moved into a apartment in Chennai and spent ‚Çπ80,000 to renovate it into a penthouse studio. Sashikanth set up an office in the basement of the apartment building. Their work was awarded the Best Young Architect of the Year award by Indian Architects and Builders magazine. In a short span of time, Space Scape developed into one of Chennai's leading firms and won national recognition for their work on projects including the British Council in Chennai during 2004. Within five years of its establishment, the company grew from five architects to 30 architects working in two cities, and accepted commissions from around India. Sashikanth's clients included Max M√ºller Bhavan; corporate projects such as Cognizant; and residential projects such as the homes of actors Suriya and Udhayanidhi Stalin, VGP House, and Chettinad House. Filmmaking career After following the production of Dharani's Kuruvi (2008), Sashikanth experienced a renewed interest in filmmaking; he considered starting his own studio, as he was \\"too old to be an assistant director and never good at taking instructions\\". Sashikanth expressed interest in the \\"Hollywood model\\" of filmmaking, where film producers are seen as those who pitch film projects, as opposed to India, where producers were seen as being the financial backers of projects. He explained that he wanted to be seen as an entrepreneur who can \\"[create] projects that are able to generate their own money\\". C. S. Amudhan, a past client of Sashikanth, submitted three pitches in different genres for his consideration. Out of the three pitches, Sashikanth went ahead with Thamizh Padam, a satire of Tamil cinema, and founded Y NOT Studios to produce the film‚Äîwhich was sold to the distributor Cloud Nine Movies and premiered in 2010. After discovering Balaji Mohan's short film Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi on YouTube, Sashikanth expressed interest in producing a full-length version, which starred Siddharth and was released in 2012 as a multilingual with Tamil and Telugu versions. Y NOT Studios handled both production and distribution for the film; Sashikanth argued that there were too many \\"middlemen\\" in the film industry, and believed that \\"the closer the producer is to the audience, the much better the money.\\" In 2014, Sashikanth partnered with several other Tamil film producers to form a distribution company known as Dream Factory. In early 2015, Sashikanth revealed that he was writing a script for a sport-themed thriller entitled Test, and that he was considering becoming a director in the future. He also revealed plans of taking Y NOT Studios into Bollywood with the release of Sudha Kongara's Saala Khadoos (2016) and a remake of Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Aaranya Kaandam (2011), but the latter did not materialise. Despite the relative failure of Y NOT's high-cost production Kaaviya Thalaivan (2014), Sashikanth's work since 2016 has been profitable.

It was meant to deal with sports and youth related affairs in the country. Currently the Philippine Sports Commission is the body responsible for government initiated effort in sports and assists the privately run Philippine Olympic Committee. History The Department of Youth and Sports Development (DYSD) was created upon the approval of Presidential Decree No. 604 issued by then President Ferdinand Marcos in December 10, 1974. This led to the abolishing of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation in 1975 with the Philippine Olympic Committee succeeding the PAAF. The government body was renamed as the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (MYSD) when the country adopted a parliamentary form of government. Through a letter of instructions issued by President Marcos in October 31, 1979, the MYSD implemented the Project Gintong Alay sports program. Upon the enactment of the Education Act of 1982, the MYSD was integrated with the Ministry of Education and Culture (MECS) which became the Department of Education and Culture (DECS) through the 1987 Constitution. Republic Act 6847 created the Philippine Sports Commission and the DECS became the Department of Education. Proposed revival On February 26, 2016, a press release from the Philippine House of Representatives indicates that the creation of a Department of Sports in the Philippines has been filed to improve the state of sports in the country. Rep. Karlo Alexei B. Nograles, chairman of the House committee on Labor and Employment, proposed House Bill 6440 (Department of Sports Act) to address the issues surrounding Philippine sports. The proposed Department of Sports, as indicated in the press release, will be \\"a cabinet-level agency to provide leadership in the promotion and development of sports in the country and set the parameters to address the needs of athletes, coaches, trainers and sports officials\\". The department will also aim to create policies that will improve the country‚Äôs performance in international sport competitions. In the press release, Rep. Nograles said, \\"It is now high time for the government to prioritize sports in the national agenda, and consider sports as an integral factor in nation building.\\" Nograles believes that the PSC has not done well in improving the sports in the country, stating, \\"After more than 20 years since the creation of the PSC, the state of Philippine sports appears to have worsened rather than improved.‚Äù His proposal includes the abolishment of the PSC, and contrariwise, provides the development of the Amateur Sports Development Bureau (ASDB), which has the primary task in the promotion and development of amateur sports in the country. Likewise, The Grassroots Sport Division and Local and National Sports Competition Division shall be established under the department. Moreover, the International Sports Development Bureau will also be constructed, and will be composed of the National Sports Association Affairs Division and the International Sports Competition Division. On November 2017, the House of Representatives created a technical working group to facilitates measures on establishment of the department amidst pertinent pending bills.

The Tributum was one of the central reasons for the conducting of the census on assets, as it rose with wealth. It included cash assets, land, property and moveable goods (i.e. slaves). Several types of tributum have been attested to, including tributum in capita, tributum temerarium (emergency levy), and tributum ex censu (amount proportional to citizen's census financial rating). Purpose With money as the mainstay of the Roman Republic‚Äôs military success, the collection and use of tributum allowed Rome and its allies to pay their soldiers and bestow their armies with food, transport, equipment and support personnel, which effectively enabled Rome‚Äôs legions to remain in the field for lengths at a time. Long service, alongside the training undertaken during wartime, allowed legions to cultivate skill at arms and unit cohesion. The development of these skills and not being required to send soldiers home to attend to the agricultural needs of the state ensured many successful military campaigns. The tributum can not be fully considered a 'tax', as there was an underlying idea that it could be paid back once military pressure was relieved. There was often an assumption that the military was supported by the monetary gains made in wartime conquests. However, it was very rare that spoils from an army‚Äôs victories equaled the money it took to win them ‚Äì in fact, only half of the campaigns resulting in triumphs produced riches greater than the payments of the involved soldiers. Origins of Tributum The origins of tributum are traditionally linked to the Siege of Veii (406 ‚Äì 398), in which the fund was used to pay soldiers. The Siege of Veii was described as a campaign in which the army served for a time longer than usual, prompting the Senate to decree Dionysius also comments on the origins of tributum, however, notes that ‚Äúdue to a lack of reliable sources, it is impossible to describe or date with any degree of certainty either the genesis of the system or its subsequent development into the complex structure which Livy and Dionysius describe‚Äù. Furthermore, both Dionysius and Livy argue that tributum was an element of the Servian system, with its introduction occurring in the sixth century under Servian reign. This view is not supported, with warfare in Rome's early city-state considering military service as an obligation without remuneration (stipendium) for soldiers. However, tributum and stipendium appear inextricably linked, with stating ‚Äútheoretically, tributum could have existed prior to the war against Veii‚Ä¶ the two institutions were so closely connected that imagining the one without the other is hardly feasible‚Äù. The Senate and the Decree of Tributum The introduction and enforcement oftributum relied on decisions made by the Senate. Unlike other Roman taxes, tributum was not established under a binding law, but required a senatorial decree to be enforced. Throughout the history of the tax, it had been opposed by plebeians, and incited by tribunes, yet it was the authority of the Senate which saw it enforced, repaid when circumstances changed, and determined depending on the number of soldiers deployed and material goods they demanded. Assessment of Wealth Collection of Tributum Tributum was not technically a tax in the true sense, being seen as a loan that must be paid by the adsidui in order to fund Rome's military expansion.Rosenstein 2016, p. 82 The assidui were Roman citizens who were eligible for military service due to their wealth but were not conscripted to serve in any particular year. This loan was not usually expected to be repaid but there were instances of reimbursement after victories as was the case following the defeat of the Samnites around 293 BCE.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 19.16.3 The tributum was paid proportionate to an individual's wealth established by their census group. It was not a flat rate of taxation, being instead determined by Rome's annual military needs.Rosenstein 2016, p. 83 Some years' estimated military costs could be higher than others based on what military operations were to be undertaken in that given year, therefore a fluctuating rate of taxation was needed. This cost would have been divided by the total wealth of the adsidui in order to establish a rate of taxation for that year. This rate was multiplied by the wealth of each adsiduus to establish the amount of tributum owed by each group respectively.Rosenstein 2016, p. 83 There is little evidence as to who physically collected tributum, but it is believed that the tribuni aerarii were responsible for its collection.Rosenstein 2016, p. 91 Recent attempts to reconstruct the tributum owed in a particular year have been met with difficulty due to the impossibility of accurately calculating the estimated military expenditure for that year, as the cost of the logistical aspects of warfare are too difficult to ascertain. Exemptions While Tributum, as with any form of taxation was largely applicable to all, there were some cases where collection of tributum was not only suspended, but where citizens could be granted immunity and therefore be exempt from collection. The collection of tributum was steady and an accepted aspect of civic life, where a brief period of suspension sparked by a significant acquisition of funds rendered tributum superfluous for the following century. After the defeat of Macedon in 167BC, Rome began to function without the Tributum due to booty accumulated through battle and the decrease in legions which needed material support. After the death of Julius Caesar the State demanded increased funds due to civil war which resulted in the reintroduction of the Tributum. Citizens in the provinces had continued to pay - unless they were subject to immunity, as was seen in the case of Egypt. However, this did not free them from their obligation to hand in a declaration for the census. The Roman citizens who qualified to pay Tributum were known as adsidui; essentially those who were not serving as legionaries paid for the benefit of those who were. The latter therefore paid no Tributum as they effectively would have been paying double tax on both money and military service . In terms of exemptions, ‚Äúthose of the last century‚Äù (a kind of sixth class below the fiver property-ratings), the proletarii or capite censi, were neither taxed nor liable for military service. This also extended to individuals who did not own property, where their lack of contribution to revenue exempted them from paying Tributum . =Women= According to , while women were usually excluded, they voluntarily contributed to Tributum during the Second Punic War. The Triumvirs later demanded woman paid the tax. Hortensia then argued that woman had never paid tax before that point, and were not obliged which resulted in the exemption of most of the 1,400 woman requested to pay.

He was the president of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway, and the founder of the American National Bank. Early life Edmund William Cole was born on July 19, 1827, in Giles County, Tennessee. He grew up on a farm. Career Cole moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1845, where he worked as a store clerk and later as a bookkeeper in the post office. In 1857, he was appointed as the superintendent of the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad by its founder, Vernon K. Stevenson. During the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865, Cole served as a colonel in the Confederate States Army. General Samuel Jones described Cole as \\"active and zealous\\" during the war. Cole was appointed as the president of the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad in 1868. Cole acquired four more lines and renamed it the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway in 1873. According to historian Jesse C. Burt, Jr., \\"His grandiose scheme for uniting disparate pieces of rail properties into a solid and well-managed enterprise was probably the first large rail consolidation to be attempted in the South.\\" When August Belmont purchased it from Stevenson in 1880, Cole resigned, and he was succeeded as president by James D. Porter. Cole co-founded the American National Bank in 1883. He also invested in real estate in Downtown Nashville and coal mines in Sheffield, Alabama. He was also an investor in the Sheffield Hotel, where he banned the sale of whisky. Philanthropy The Anna Russell Cole Auditorium. In 1885, Cole founded the Randall Cole School, and he hired Dr W. C. Kilvington as superintendent. In 1887, Cole donated it to the state of Tennessee, and it was renamed the Tennessee Industrial School. In 1894, it moved into the Anna Russell Cole Auditorium, named for Cole's second wife. Cole served as the treasurer of the board of trust of Vanderbilt University. In 1892, he donated $5,000 to endow the annual Cole Lecture, \\"for the defense and advocacy of the Christian religion.\\" Cole made a donation to the Bruce family shortly after the Lynching of Ephraim Grizzard in 1892. Personal life, death and legacy Cole was married twice. His first wife, Louisa McGavock, died in 1869; her funeral ceremony was conducted by reverends John Berry McFerrin and Robert A. Young. They lived at 182 Church Street. His second wife, Anna Russell, was a native of Augusta, Georgia whose father had served as the first Democratic mayor of Augusta after the Civil War. Their wedding, conducted by Bishop Holland Nimmons McTyeire, was attended by Confederate veterans Bushrod Johnson and Edmund Kirby Smith. The Coles first resided at Terrace Place, a three-story townhouse on Church Street in Nashville, until they moved into Colemere, a mansion designed for them by Confederate veteran and architect William Crawford Smith. They had a son, Whitefoord Russell Cole, who became a prominent businessman. Cole was a member of the Democratic Party, and he attended the McKendree United Methodist Church. Cole died of heart disease on May 25, 1899 at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City. His funeral was held at the McKendree United Methodist Church in Nashville. After his death, his widow hired sculptor George Julian Zolnay to design his bust; it was installed in Kirkland Hall, the administration building of Vanderbilt University. When Kirkland Hall burned down in 1905, it was replaced with a marble bust alongside his widow's portrait by Willie Betty Newman.

Wood from the Island Ironwood (Lyonothamnus floribundus) were used for constructing harpoons and canoe paddles, while wood from the Green Bark Lilac (Venture√±o: washiko) were used for offertory poles, digging sticks, awls, plank canoe wedges, and fencing. * Desert Garden: represents species found in drier scrublands, including the Coast Prickly Pear (Venture√±o: kh…®‚Äô…®l), chia sage (Venture√±o: ‚Äòitepesh), Thistle Sage (Venture√±o: pakh), White Sage (Venture√±o: khapsh…®kh), Toloache/Jimsonweed (Venture√±o: momoy), and Chaparral Yucca (Venture√±o: shtakuk). Seeds from species such as Thistle Sage and Chia Sage were eaten, while fruits were eaten and paint pigment made of the Coast Prickly Pear. The highly toxic roots of Jimsonweed were ponded, soaked and strained in order to make a hallucinogenic drink for initiation rituals and the shaman. * Fruits and Flower Garden: located by the museum entrance is a garden featuring endemic plants from Chumash lands that produced flowers and/or fruits. Species include Hummingbird Sage (Venture√±o: pakh), Three-Leaved Sumac (Venture√±o: shuna‚Äôy), California Blackberry (Venture√±o: t…®h…®), Yerba Buena (Venture√±o: ‚Äòalaqtaha), Snowberry (Venture√±o: chtu ‚Äòiqonon), California Wild Rose (Venture√±o: watiq‚Äôoniq‚Äôon), Coast Live Oak (Venture√±o: kuw), and Western Virgin‚Äôs Bower/Creek Clematis (Venture√±o: makhsik). Fruits were eaten raw from a variety of these species, including Golden Currant, Gooseberry, California Blackberry and California Wild Rose (the rose hips). The Coast Live Oak was a preferred source of acorns, but its wood was also used for stirring paddles, firewood, and shoots for the hoop in hoop-and-pole game. Leaves from Hummingbird Sage and Western Virgin‚Äôs Bower were rubbed on the skin to treat sores or cure illness by sorcery.

He moved to Nikkatsu in 1928, often appearing as villains, but it was his comic role in Mansaku Itami's The Peerless Patriot (1932) that helped start his career in comedy. Sadao Yamanaka used him in such a role in The Million Ryo Pot (1935).

The flowering species grows in the tropical environments of central Africa, and is renown in traditional Nigerian medicine for treating sexual impotence, the common cold, diarrhea, and most notably, its potent hypoglycemic effect. Recent research has been conducted, looking in to the species' potential anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, and antioxidant bioactivities and mechanisms of action.  Etymology  The species' anti-diabetic qualities yielded the name Sakayau and Kashe Zaki meaning \\"sweet killer\\" or \\"destroying sweetness\\" in the Hausa language used in Northern Nigeria.  Taxonomy and related species  Taxonomic synonyms of the species include Anisopus batesii, A. bicornatus, A. bicoronata, A. rostriferus, Marsdenia batesii, M. bicoronata, M. rhynchogyna, M. rostrifera. Much of the taxonomical redundancy seen in A. mannii likely stems from a few minor failures of its founding taxonomist‚ÄîNicholas Edward Brown. N.E. Brown's failure to recognize the \\"generic unity\\" between species from the genera Marsdenia and Anisopus‚Äîespecially in misidentifying specific features/outgrowths of the corolla, corona, tubercule, and pedicel shape.  Description  Anisopus mannii possesses slightly green flowers in globose lateral umbelliform cymes. This description refers to the flower's determinate inflorescences (consisting of multiple pedicels). The species is also observed to be a strong climber. Features are largely conserved among the species of the genus Anisopus (including A. mannii). Characteristics such as a deep green leaf color, with a yellow tinge (linked with aluminum accumulation) have been observed, in addition to maroon flowers with a greenish tinge. Differences in Anisopus flower color is one of the few indicators of distinction between the cream/white shaded flowers seen in some less related Marsdenia species.  Distribution and habitat  The species is native to Africa, especially prominent in the central and western tropical regions. A. mannii spans the modern day countries of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Gabon, the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, and Senegal. Species in the genus Anisopus are generally found in closed rain forest environments.  Chemical composition  Proton NMR, carbon NMR, and IR spectroscopic techniques have unveiled a series of bioactive compounds found in Anisopus mannii. A novel chemical structure, \\"anisopusine\\"‚Äî a 1,7-naphthyridine alkaloid ‚Äî was extracted from the dichloromethane soluble extract of the plant's bark. Along with the novel molecule, [6]-gingerdione, [6]-dehydrogingerdione, 5Œ±-hydroxy- lup-20(29)-en-3Œ≤-yl eicosanoate, and ferulic acid were isolated from the acetone extract of the species' bark. Traditional uses In traditional medicine in Nigeria, various parts of the plant have been used to treat elevated blood sugar levels, piles (hemorrhoids), diarrhea, infectious diseases, warding off sexual impotence, treating wounds, and to promote lactation. In the southwest province of Cameroon, A. mannii, was utilized as a traditional fish poisoning agent. This fishing method is also employed using a variety of other bioactive plant species.

Career Tangl was born in Wolfsberg, Carinthia, on 28 May 1864, to a family of bakers. He attended school at Saint Paul's Abbey, Lavanttal, near Wolfsberg, started at age 11; he later said that the wealth of deeds in the abbey's library became an inspiration for him.Tangl 9. He studied history and classical philology at the University of Vienna from 1881 to 1884, and until 1887 at the , which prepared students for work in archives, libraries, and museums. There he met two historians who would be of great importance later in his life: Theodor von Sickel and Engelbert M√ºhlbacher.Tangl 9-10. Until 1891 he studied at the Austrian Historical Institutein Rome, on the recommendation of von Sickel; his work there led to the publication, in 1894, of Die p√§pstlichen Kanzleiordnungen von 1200‚Äì1500.Tangl 10. Tangl was aided in the compilation of this work by his discovery of a 1560 book in the Barberini library that recorded events and transactions of the Apostolic Chancery going back to the Avignon papacy. He gained his doctorate in 1889, and his habilitation in 1892 under M√ºhlbacher, in the history of the Middle Ages and auxiliary sciences of history. He worked as a civil servant for the archives of the Austrian ministry of the Interior, and later that of Finances; during this time he published his only essay on a more recent topic, the Italian writer Silvio Pellico.Tangl 10. M√ºhlbacher helped him acquire a position with the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, in the Diplomata section.Tangl 11. In 1892 he began editing the deeds of the early Carolingians, and published, after the death of M√ºhlbacher, the first volume in 1906. From 1903 on he worked on the republication of the Placita and took charge of the Epistolae. He was elected a member of the board of the MGH in 1902. After 1911 he was editor of the MGH's journal, Deutsches Archiv (then called Neues Archiv). During World War 1 and until 1919 he directed the MGH. In 1895 he was appointed at the University of Marburg, at their newly founded program for Auxiliary sciences of history. In 1897 he was appointed at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t in Berlin, where from 1900 until his death he was professor of Auxiliary sciences of history and medieval history. He became a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, and in 1918 was selected as member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Notable work Tangl published two articles in Neues Archiv on the Boniface correspondence, articles considered \\"foundational\\" by Theodor Schieffer. They include an important discussion of the so-called Zachary exemption, a forgery in the Boniface correspondence that supported the Fulda Abbey's status as exempt from the local diocese. Of particular importance was his settling of the death date of Boniface, which he determined was 754, not 755. His edition of the Boniface correspondence, the last of three critical editions (he was preceded by Philipp Jaff√© and Ernst D√ºmmler), was published in 1916 by the MGH and is considered the definitive edition.

Gapjil is a neologism made by combining the word Gap (Í∞ë; Áî≤)‚Äîwhich is used to introduce the first party in a contract, but also refers to superior status‚Äîand jil (-Ïßà), a suffix that negatively refers to particular actions. It is a phenomenon associated with the hierarchical nature of Korean society and work culture, a structure which results in the social superiority of those with higher wealth. Various incidents, such as the nut rage controversy, have resulted in popularization of the term and brought the phenomenon to the attention of world media.  Causes  Song Jae-ryung, a professor of sociology at Kyunghee University, points out that Gapjil is not simply a matter of an individual's morality, but a societal problem. As the bottom of Korean society is constituted by the repressive role of gap and submissive attitude of eul, individuals follow the culture of the elite. In other words, the cause of gapjil is a cultural tendency for people to merely perform the roles which are shaped by the high power distance in Korea. This is why an individual who was eul in another situation does the same thing (gapjil) in another relationship when he or she becomes another gap. In order to solve the gapjil problem, Prof. Song says that each individual needs to admit the social position that is different horizontally, not vertically, and the social atmosphere that fosters this awareness needs to be formed.  Types and examples of gapjil  According to Korean magazine Economic Review, there are some obvious types of gapjil depending on the context: owner gapjil, push- driven distribution gapjil, and passion-pay.  Owner gapjil  Owner gapjil is the most common type of gapjil, where representatives or executive family members of a company treat their employees with contempt, using abusive language or even physical assault. Owner gapjil reflects the mistaken view that employers can treat employees however they want because of the extreme vertical relationship between the two. = Monggo Food Kim Man-sik scandal = On 23 December 2015, there was a report that Kim Man-sik, honorary president of Monggo Food, had used abusive language and assaulted his chauffeur 'B'. The assaulted employee said, \\"President Kim indulges in violence and hurl abuses almost like a habit, if his mood is bad\\". After Monggo Food posted an apology on its website on 23 December, Kim Man-sik and Kim Hyeon-seung, CEO of the firm, apologized to the public and to the person directly involved on 25 December in a press conference. Although there had been a disagreement with victims concerning a problem of reinstatement, an amicable settlement was made with the victims of the assault. On 19 April 2016, the Masan Branch of the Changwon District Public Prosecutor's Office requested that Kim Man-sik issue a summary order of 7,000,000 won (about 6,000 dollars as of July 2018) in fines relating to habitual assaults, violence and violation of labour standards. = M&M; Choi Cheol-won scandal = In October 2010, Choi Cheol-won, the CEO of M&M;, called a tank truck driver who had gone on a demonstration in front of the SK headquarters to his office, and assaulted him with such objects as a baseball bat. As a result, the driver suffered injuries requiring two weeks of medical treatment. This incident was reported in the editorial program of MBC, which aired on 28 November 2010. Huge amounts of public criticism, particularly resulting from a memorandum that had been written to certify that the driver was given 20,000,000 won (about $US 19,000 dollars as of July 2018) as compensation for the violence. After Choi Cheol-won had been charged on 30 November, the police started to investigate the scandal. On 8 February 2011, the Seoul Central District Court sentenced him to 18 months in prison and the appellate tribunal sentenced him to 18 months in prison with three years of probation and 120 hours of community service. The judgement of the court's decision, saying \\"Social criticism is a reason for the sentence,\\" caused controversy. = Nut rage and Korean Air scandals = The Nut rage incident was an air rage incident that occurred on December 5, 2014 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Korean Air vice president Heather Cho (Cho Hyun-ah), dissatisfied with the way an attendant served nuts, ordered the aircraft to return to the gate before takeoff. After a heated confrontation with the cabin crew chief, Cho assaulted him and ordered him fired and removed from the plane, requiring a return to the gate and delaying the flight. The airline claimed that the chief had voluntarily resigned until he took his situation to the press, causing a media furor. Cho and Korean Air were heavily criticized, and in the aftermath Cho resigned from one of her several executive positions at Korean Air. She was subsequently found guilty in a South Korean court of obstructing aviation safety. The flight attendant and cabin crew chief returned to their positions by April 2016. Korean Air executive Cho Hyun-min allegedly sprayed water on company's employees, and in March 2018 the allegations of yelling and spraying water on an advertising agent caused rising controversy. When concerns over Cho's behavior became widespread, Korean Air explained, ‚ÄúIt is true that during the meeting, the water rose and splashed when the bucket fell on the floor, but it did not spray water on the staff‚Äù. Cho apologized for her behavior. This incident caused international media to start using the word gapjil. In a similar incident in December 2018, a Korean Air pilot attempted to take a glass of champagne and was blocked by the cabin crew chief, again demanding a cup of wine from cabin crew later on during the flight to Amsterdam‚Äîin violation of generally very strict rules in the flight industry prohibiting alcohol consumption by pilots. The airline gave only a mild reprimand to the captain, but demoted the cabin crew chief who rebuffed him and reported the incident.  Push-driven distribution gapjil  'Push- driven distribution gapjil' is a type of gapjil where large corporations make pressing delivery (or supply) demands to small businesses (franchises). = Namyang Dairy Products Corporation high-pressure sales to franchises scandal = logo of Namyang In May 2013, Namyang Co. was criticised following an accusation that the firm had pressed local franchises to buy products for a long time, as well as a tape-recording of rough words to local owners. Namyang Co. caused more than 20 billion won worth (about 18 million dollars as of July 2018) of damage through illegal activities‚Äîsuch as high-pressure sales and shifting wages of salesmen to local franchises‚Äîfor the past seven years, for which the Seoul Central District Court convicted it in January 2014. There was also a boycott against Namyang Corporation. = Hyundai Mobis high-pressure sales scandal = Hyundai Mobis Logo In September 2017, Hyundai Mobis was suspected of pressure to achieve sales goals and forced sales by 1600 branches of local maintenance shops from January 2010 to November 2013. The manager of the local shops was pressed to buy unnecessary parts of an automobile under the description of \\"Random Sales\\" and \\"Negotiated Sales\\" in order to achieve the goal of the head office. Hyundai Mobis admitted carrying out these acts and since then has been establishing a plan to ensure they do not reoccur.  Passion-pay  Lie Sang Bong Passion-pay is a type of labour extortion where a business or enterprise pays less than minimum wage, or even nothing, for the labor of young job seekers on the excuse that the position will be prestigious or advantageous. = Lie Sang Bong Design Studio's passion-pay scandal = In January 2015, Lie Sang Bong design studio, which is managed by Korean fashion designer Lie Sang Bong, was embroiled in controversy about passion- pay. Although the studio imposed excessive workloads on workers, the studio offered relatively low wages: 100,000 won (about $US 90 as of July 2018) for apprentices, 300,000 won (about $270) for interns and 1,100,000 won (about $1,000 dollars) for regular workers. After the controversy, Lie Sang Bong said \\"I deeply apologized to the youths of the fashion industry who get hurt with working environment and treatment, and I'll try to improve the overall problem of the fashion industry in this opportunity\\". = Jo Min-ah's Bakery's \\"Meal instead pay\\" = In January 2015 \\"The Space Goddess Jo Min-ah's Bakery\\", run by a former member of K-Pop band Jewelry, posted a job offer at 5,500 won per hour, less than the legal minimum hourly wage of 5,580 won. Seoul National University Hospital = Seoul National University Hospital nurse passion-pay scandal = In September 2017, Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) was in a controversy because it had inflicted passion-pay on newly graduated nurses for five years since 2012, for a \\"probationary education period\\". It turned out that SNUH only paid 360,000 won (about $US 350 as of July 2018) for 24 days work to 1,212 nurses in their period of education. Based on an eight hour working day, the sum of 360,000 won is equivalent to an hourly rate of 1,800 won (about 2 dollars), which is far below the minimum wage of 6,470 won (about 6 dollars). The hospital explained that they did not know whether they should pay full wages during the training session. In addition, they plan to provide retroactive payment to nurses under three years, which is a period appointed by the recent labor standard law.  Social responses   Boycott  Boycott can be defined as a movement of consumers' refusal to buy a particular item in order to accomplish a specific purpose. Unlike gapjil (which is a structural problem between 'Gap' and 'Eul', like the franchise- maker and the retailer), the boycott campaign showed that it can explode instantly when the problem touches consumer's feelings. This is because consumers think that not consuming products of gapjil firms is the best thing they can do. This movement suggests that the gapjil of company owners or executives is becoming a 'self-harm' activity which decreases corporate profits. Experts emphasize that in order to reduce corporate ethical problems, such as gapjil, consumers need to change their perception as a consumer in a larger frame of mind. Corporations will be changed when consumer involvement such as resentment at gapjil and boycott is increased. A consumer movement group staged boycott campaigns and received favourable responses from consumers, but there has not yet been a massive and organised boycott.  24-hour call center for reporting damages by gapjil  On 11 April 2016, the Korean civil society organisation Public Welfare Committee (PWC) opened a 24-hour call centre for reporting gapjil damages and behavior. It is operated for rooting out irregular practices. PWC explained that the purpose of the call center was to prevent gapjil behavior, which is prevalent in South Korean society, and to conduct criminal and civil measures through case verification.  Governmental responses   Investigation of gapjil  Korean Fair Trade Commission Logo After Kim Sang-jo was inaugurated as chairperson of the Korean Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the FTC started an investigation of all industrial head offices and franchises to resolve all gapjil cases in four major areas: distribution, affiliate, subcontract, and franchise. Beginning 10 August 2017, the FTC began investigating the transactions between headquarters and agencies, which targeted about 4,800 headquarters, 70 franchises, and groups of franchises in all domestic industries. The investigation was conducted as a survey targeting the headquarters between August and September, and since then targeted the franchises and groups of franchises from September to December. The FTC said the purpose of the investigation was to secure basic data to prevent unfair trade practices between headquarters and franchises, in order to prepare policies and improve the system.  Ombudsman  In July 2017, the FTC established an ombudsman for permanent surveillance of protection measures about franchises. The ombudsman was organised with former and current merchants with experience in franchise trading and 13 members of the FTC. They planned to expand the members to 30, including wholesale, retail, and service sectors. The ombudsman regularly monitors trading practices in franchise sectors and reports to the FTC when signs of unfair trade are detected. In addition, they state their opinion in policy enforcement, and they suggest ideas to improve the system by collecting problems information on the field.  Unfair damage counseling center in Seoul  150x150px For the first time in local government, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started to eradicate unfair practices in the franchise industry, declaring, \\"2016 economic democratisation city, Seoul\\". The Seoul Metropolitan Government has operated an unfair damage counselling centre, where anyone who suffered from unfair damages can report their case through the member's office. Not only the franchiser who is operating the franchise but also an ex-franchiser and groups of franchisers can report unfair cases of members. When the report is received, first, the government identifies the exact facts of the incident through an in-depth consultation with the franchiser who reported the incident, then meets with a group of franchisers. According to the issue, the government recommends to the headquarters of the franchise a voluntary corrective action or handles arrangements. Depending on the degree of violation of the law, the investigation request to the FTC or the prosecution are reviewed.  Media responses  In December 2014, the nut rage incident was covered by numerous international media, and gapjil reached a level of global prominence. In February 2015, the Reuters news agency reported about Korean gapjil culture and the judgement of the nut rage incident. The article suggested that Korean gapjil culture originates from a traditional vertical hierarchy in Korean society. In May 2015, British newspaper The Independent reported on the No-Look Pass issue of Korean politician Kim Moo-sung, and pointed out that most gapjil is done by Korean adult males in positions of authority, especially middle aged men.

K is nominally the logarithm of seismic energy (in Joules) radiated by an earthquake, as expressed in the formula K = log ES.NMSOP-2 Information Sheet . Values of K in the range of 12 to 15 correspond approximately to the range of 4.5 to 6 in other magnitude scales;. a magnitude quake will register between 13 and 14.5 on various K-class scales.. The energy class system was developed by seismologists of the Soviet Tadzhikskaya Complex [Interdisciplinary] Seismological Expedition established in the remote Garm (Tajikistan) region of Central Asia in 1954 after several devastating earthquakes in that area.; . The Garm region is one of the most seismically active regions of the former Soviet Union,. with up to 5,000 earthquakes per year.. The volume of processing needed, and the rudimentary state of seismological equipment and methods at that time, led the expedition workers to develop new equipment and methods.; . V. I. Bune is credited with developing a scale based on an earthquake's seismic energy,. although S. L. Solov'ev seems to have made major contributions.Solov'ev is mentioned in this regard in . Solov'ev's dissertation, \\"Energy Classification of Earthquakes of the USSR\\", and two other related works are cited in . (In contrast to the \\"Richter\\" and other magnitude scales developed by Western seismologists, which estimate the magnitude from the amplitude of some portion of the seismic waves generated, an indirect measure of seismic energy.) However, proper estimation of ES requires more sophisticated tools than were available at the time, and Bune's method was unworkable. A more practical revision was presented by T. G. Rautian in 1958 and 1960; by 1961 K-class was being used across the USSR.. A key change was to estimate ES on the basis of peak amplitude of the seismic waves ‚Äì particularly, the sum of maximum P-wave and maximum S-wave ‚Äì within the first three seconds.. See for a more detailed description. As a result, K-class became a kind of local magnitude scale, similarly limited to local and regional earthquakes of about M 6.5 (K 15) or less, above which point it saturates (underestimates the magnitude).; . Rautian also developed a nomogram to simplify some of the calculations, and used a number of simplifying assumptions appropriate for the Garm region.. That version is sometimes labelled KR to distinguish it from other versions ‚Äì KF, KS, KFS, KC, etc. ‚Äì that have been adapted for the Sakhalin, Kurile, and Kamchatka regions in the Far East., and map coordinates for regions in Table 3, pp. 162‚Äì163; , map of regional networks on p. 580; . There are various formulas to convert K-class to other magnitude scales; these are usually specific to the regional network.See Table 1 in for a list.

He is primarily an enemy of Luke Cage and is notable for being the first major supervillain that he faced. The character was portrayed by Erik LaRay Harvey in the first season of the Netflix television series Luke Cage set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Publication history Willis Stryker was created by Archie Goodwin and George Tuska and first appeared in Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #1 (June 1972).

Fictional character biography Willis Stryker, one of Luke's childhood friends, first appeared in Luke Cage: Hero for Hire #1. He is known as Diamondback for his mastery of knives, including specially-gimmicked knives that explode, release toxic gases or create sonic waves. Willis Stryker was born and raised in Harlem, New York City. He grew up on the street alongside Carl Lucas, his best friend and future partner. He was recruited into one of the local gangs, The Rivals. The gang consisted mostly of Carl Lucas, Stryker, Shades and Comanche.Shadowland: Power Man #2. Marvel Comics.

Carl changed his name to Luke Cage and escaped from prison thanks to his bulletproof skin and searched for revenge. Luke Cage was attacked by hitmen hired by Diamondback. When the attack failed, Diamondback has his inventor Gadget-Man create new gimmicked switch blades to deal with Cage and kidnapped Claire Temple. Tracking Diamondback to his lair, Luke was surprised to find that it was his old friend Stryker. Diamondback battled Cage who hoped to clear his name. During the fight, Diamondback fell through a skylight and was blown up by one of his own trick switchblades, ruining any hope Luke had that Stryker could clear his name. Just then Claire arrived with Noah Burstein (the man who conducted the prison experiments) and the police, and Luke wonders if Burstein will turn him over to the authorities.Hero for Hire #2. Marvel Comics. Diamondback later turned up alive. He then began to make plans to become a crime lord where he will start in Harlem and then rule the crime on the Eastern Seaboard. Upon having his men arrange for a meeting with the crime lords at Club Ultimate, Diamondback planned to have waving network of influence. The meeting was crashed by Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and Daredevil. After the fight, Diamondback managed to injure Jessica Jones at her apartment by shooting her.Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 #All-New Guardians of the Galaxy. Marvel Comics.

Unbeknownst to Diamondback, Black Cat dropped Luke Cage off at Night Nurse's location and she was able to cure him. After recuperation, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and their allies went after Diamondback and attacked him at Club Ultimate. Diamondback demonstrated his new abilities like superhuman strength and speed. Although he was injured in the fight, Diamondback got away.Defenders Vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics. During their stakeout of Club Ultimate, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones were ambushed by Diamondback, where he knocked over Jessica Jones' car and broke Iron Fist's back. While gloating over Iron Fist, Diamondback was caught off guard when Jessica Jones attacked him. After being defeated by Jessica Jones and Iron Fist, Diamondback was arrested by the police and transferred to a prison, as he was deemed too dangerous to be placed in the county lockup. He's placed along with the Punisher, who was captured by Daredevil and Luke Cage. During the ride, Diamondback taunts the Punisher, causing the truck to crash and enabling them to escape. He later shows up at Black Cat's apartment, where he shoots her multiple times in retaliation for Cat saving Luke Cage.Defenders Vol. 5 #3-5. Marvel Comics.

Following his return from the dead, Diamondback appeared to possess some degree of superhuman strength, being able to throw a person across a room, catch a punch from Jessica Jones and lift her up with one hand, as well as having some degree of superhuman speed. It's later revealed that his super-strength and speed come from consuming drugs.Defenders Vol. 5 #6 In other media Television * Diamondback appears in Luke Cage, portrayed by Erik LaRay Harvey, while his younger appearance is portrayed by Jared Kemp. He is Luke Cage's older half-brother as a result of an affair that Luke's father James Lucas had with his secretary Dana Stryker, making him a composite of the comics' Willis Stryker and Coldfire. When they were younger, Willis and Luke were best friends until they were arrested for car theft. Luke was sent to military school and joined the Marines, while Willis served juvenile detention and then jail when he was forced to kill in self-defense. This event, along with his mother's death from cancer after his biological father abandoned her, made Willis swear a vendetta on Luke. He eventually gets revenge by framing Luke and sending him to Seagate Prison. By the 2010s, Willis has become an arms dealer, trafficking Hammer Industries weapons to Harlem crime boss Cornell \\"Cottonmouth\\" Stokes and his cousin Mariah Dillard. When a couple of young men attack an arms deal between crews working for Cottonmouth and Spanish Harlem crime boss Domingo Colon, Willis sends in Shades to help them. Upon hearing that Luke is alive, Willis comes out of hiding to exact revenge with a weapon of his known as the Judas bullet, a line of exploding hollow-point bullets developed by Hammer Industries from salvaged alien metal that can penetrate Luke's skin. He manages to critically wound Luke with a Judas bullet the first time they face off. While Luke goes into hiding with Claire to get treatment from Dr. Noah Burstein, Willis assists Mariah and Shades in framing Luke and continuing Cottonmouth's criminal empire. In an effort to draw Luke out of hiding, tarnish Luke's name, and also persuade the NYPD to buy his Judas bullets, Willis murders a random police officer in broad daylight by punching him in the chest with a specially designed glove that replicates Luke's physical strength. This action, along with his decision to shoot Misty Knight when she tries to apprehend him in Harlem's Paradise and stage a hostage situation when Luke comes to her rescue, causes him to have a falling out with Mariah and Shades. Willis sends Zip and two associates to kill Shades, but Shades kills all three of them and escapes. He later kills Domingo when he and his men try to kill Willis to assert a monopoly over organized crime in Harlem. After killing Domingo, Willis dons a specially armored battle-suit designed by Hammer and challenges Luke to a fight in the street outside Pop's barbershop. After a lengthy fight, Luke manages to defeat Willis, leaving him for Misty to take into custody. He is last seen in an unidentified infirmary where Dr. Burstein is tending to his wounds. * In the third season episode of Jessica Jones titled \\"AKA Everything\\", Luke mentions Diamondback is now incarcerated in the Raft prison and how it was the hardest thing he had to do.
