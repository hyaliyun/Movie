While featuring the Macintosh look and feel, and resolution and color similar to the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST, it remains compatible with earlier Apple II models. The \\"GS\\" in the name stands for \\"Graphics and Sound,\\" referring to its enhanced multimedia hardware, especially its state-of-the-art audio. The microcomputer is a radical departure from any previous Apple II, with its 16-bit 65C816 microprocessor, direct access to megabytes of random-access memory (RAM), and mouse. It was the first computer produced by Apple to use a color graphical user interface (color was introduced on the Macintosh II six months later) and Apple Desktop Bus interface for keyboards, mice, and other input devices. It is the first personal computer to have a wavetable synthesis chip, using technology from Ensoniq. The IIGS set forth a promising future and evolutionary advancement of the Apple II line, but Apple increasingly focused on the Macintosh platform. Apple ceased IIGS production in December 1992.  Hardware features  The Apple IIGS made significant improvements over previous machines from the line such as the Apple IIe and Apple IIc. It emulates its predecessors by utilizing a custom chip called the Mega II and used the new Western Design Center 65C816 16-bit microprocessor running at , which is faster than the 8-bit NMOS 6502 and CMOS 65C02 processors used in the earlier Apple II models. Use of the 65C816 allows the IIGS to address considerably more RAM. The use of a clock was a deliberate marketing decision to limit the IIGS's performance to a level lower than that of the Macintosh, a decision that had a critical effect on the IIGS's success; the original 65C816 processor used in the IIGS was certified to run at up to . Additionally, as early as 1987, faster versions of the 65C816 processor were readily available, with certified speeds of between 5 and 14 MHz. Apple, however, refused to make use of the faster microprocessors (which had a negligible difference in cost, if any) and intentionally kept the machine locked down to 2.8 MHz throughout its entire production run.https://lowendmac.com/2015/apple-iigs-more-power- more-colors-awesome-sound/ The IIGS also includes enhanced graphics and sound, which led to its GS name. Its graphical capabilities are the best of the Apple II series, with new higher resolution video modes. These include a 640√ó200-pixel mode with 2-bit color and a 320√ó200-pixel mode with 4-bit color, both of which can select 4 or 16 colors (respectively) at a time from a palette of 4,096 colors. By changing the palette on each scanline, it is possible to display up to 256 colors or more per screen, which was quite commonly seen within games and graphic design software during this computer's heyday. Through some clever programming, it is possible to make the IIGS display as many as 3,200 colors at once. When first introduced, Apple's user interface known as MouseDesk and the IIGS System Demo were both in black and white only. Users did not see color until an application which took advantage of the new features was launched. Audio is generated by a built-in sound-and- music synthesizer in the form of the Ensoniq 5503 digital oscillator chip, which has its own dedicated RAM and 32 separate channels of sound. These channels are paired to produce 15 voices in stereo audio. Although Apple had hoped that the IIc would outsell the IIe, the latter was more popular because of its slots. The IIGS supports both 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch floppy disks and, like the IIe before it, has several expansion slots. These include seven general-purpose expansion slots compatible with those on the Apple II, II+, and IIe, plus a memory expansion slot that can be used to add up to 8 MB of RAM. The IIGS, like the IIc, also has dedicated ports for external devices. These include a port to attach even more floppy disk drives, two serial ports for devices such as printers and modems (which can also be used to connect to a LocalTalk network), an Apple Desktop Bus port to connect the keyboard and mouse, and composite and RGB video ports. These ports are associated with the slots, so for example using a card in slot 1 means that the printer port is disabled. The machine also features a user-adjustable control panel and real- time clock, which are maintained by a built-in battery (a non-replaceable 3.6-volt lithium battery; removable in a later revision motherboard). The IIGS also supports booting from an AppleShare server, via the AppleTalk protocol, over LocalTalk cabling. When the Apple IIe Workstation Card was introduced, this capability was given to the IIe. This was over a decade before NetBoot offered the same capability to computers running Mac OS 8 and beyond. = Graphics modes = In addition to supporting all graphics modes of previous Apple II models, the Apple IIGS introduced several new ones through a custom video graphics chip (VGC), all of which use a 12-bit palette for a total of 4,096 possible colors, though not all colors can appear onscreen at the same time. * 320√ó200 pixels with a single palette of 16 colors. * 320√ó200 pixels with up to 16 palettes of 16 colors. In this mode, the VGC holds 16 separate palettes of 16 colors in its own memory. Each of the 200 scan lines can be assigned any one of these palettes allowing for up to 256 colors on the screen at once. * 320√ó200 pixels with up to 200 palettes of 16 colors. In this mode, the CPU assists the VGC in swapping palettes into and out of the video memory so that each scan line can have its own palette of 16 colors allowing for up to 3,200 colors on the screen at once. * 320√ó200 pixels with 15 colors per palette, plus a fill-mode color. In this mode, color 0 in the palette is replaced by the last non-zero color pixel displayed on the scan line (to the left), allowing fast solid-fill graphics (drawn with only the outlines). * 640√ó200 pixels with 4 pure colors. * 640√ó200 pixels with up to 16 palettes of 4 pure colors. In this mode, the VGC holds 16 separate palettes of 4 pure colors in its own memory. Each of the 200 scan lines can be assigned any one of these palettes allowing for up to 64 colors on the screen at once. * 640√ó200 pixels with 16 dithered colors. In this mode, two palettes of four pure colors each are used in alternating columns. The hardware then dithers the colors of adjacent pixels to create 16 total colors on the screen. Each scan line on the screen can independently select either 320- or 640-line mode, fill mode (320-mode only), and any of the 16 palettes, allowing graphics modes to be mixed on the screen. This is most often seen in graphics programs where the menu bar is constantly in 640-pixel resolution and the working area's mode can be changed depending on the user's needs. = Audio features = The Apple IIGS's sound is provided by an Ensoniq 5503 DOC wavetable synthesis chip designed by Bob Yannes, creator of the SID synthesizer chip used in the Commodore 64. The ES5503 DOC is the same chip used in Ensoniq Mirage and Ensoniq ESQ-1 professional-grade synthesizers. The chip has 32 oscillators, which allows for up to 32 independent voices, though Apple's firmware pairs them into 15 voices (one oscillator is reserved for system timing) for fuller richer sound, as do most of the standard tools of the operating system (the MIDISynth Tool Set groups four channels per voice, for a limit of seven-voice audio). The IIGS is often referred to as a 15-voice system, because one stereo voice is reserved by the OS at all times for timing and system sounds. Software that does not use the OS, or uses custom-programmed tools (most games and demos do this), can access the chip directly and take advantage of all 32 voices. The computer's audio capabilities were given as the primary reason for record label Apple Corps's 1989 resumption of legal action against Apple that had been previously suspended. Apple Corps claimed that the IIGS's audio chip violated terms of the 1981 settlement with the company that prohibited Apple, Inc. from getting involved in the music business. A standard -inch headphone jack is provided on the back of the case, and standard stereo computer speakers can be attached there. However, this jack provides only mono sound and a third-party adapter card is required for stereo, despite the fact that the Ensoniq and virtually all native software produces stereo audio (stereo audio is essentially built into the machine, but has to be de-multiplexed by third-party cards). The Ensoniq is capable of driving 16 speaker channels, however the molex expansion connector Apple provided only allows for 8 channels, while most stereo card only provided for 2 channel--left/right stereo. MDIdeas SuperSonic and Applied Engineering's SonicBlaster are one of a few developed cards for this purpose, as well as provide an input to the Ensoniq's built in ADC for capturing and recording real-world sound into the computer. 64 KB of dedicated sound memory (DOC-RAM) is built-in on the IIGS's motherboard, separate from system memory, for the Ensoniq chip to store its sampled wavetable instruments. = Expansion capabilities = An Apple SCSI expansion card installed in an Apple IIGS Like the Apple II machines before it, the IIGS is highly expandable. The expansion slots can be used for a variety of purposes, greatly increasing the computer's capabilities. SCSI host adapters can be used to connect external SCSI devices such as hard drives and a CD-ROM drive. Other mass-storage devices such as adapters supporting more recent internal 2.5-inch IDE hard drives can also be used. Another common class of Apple IIGS expansion cards is accelerator cards, such as Applied Engineering's TransWarp GS, replacing the computer's original processor with a faster one. Applied Engineering developed the PC Transporter, which is essentially an IBM-PC/XT on a card. A variety of other cards were also produced, including ones allowing new technologies such as 10BASE-T Ethernet and CompactFlash cards to be used on the IIGS. = Development and codenames = Steve Wozniak said in January 1985 that Apple was investigating the 65816, and that an 8MHz version would \\"beat the pants off a 68000 in most applications\\", but any product using it would have to be compatible with the Apple II. Rumors spread about his work on an \\"Apple IIx\\". The IIx was said to have a 16-bit CPU, one megabyte of RAM, and better graphics and sound. \\"IIx\\" was the code name for Apple's first internal project to develop a next- generation Apple II based on the 65816. The IIx project, though, became bogged down when it attempted to include various coprocessors allowing it to emulate other computer systems. Early samples of the 65816 were also problematic. These problems led to the cancellation of the IIx project, but later, a new project was formed to produce an updated Apple II. This project, which led to the released IIGS, was known by various codenames while the new system was being developed, including \\"Phoenix\\", \\"Rambo\\", \\"Gumby\\", and \\"Cortland\\". There were rumors of several vastly enhanced prototypes built over the years at Apple but none were ever released. Only one, the \\"Mark Twain\\", has been revealed so far. The Mark Twain prototype (named for Twain's famous quote \\"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated\\") was expected to have the \\"ROM 04\\" revision (although prototypes that have been discovered do not contain any new ROM code) and featured an 8 MHz 65C816, built-in SuperDrive, 2 MB of RAM, and a hard drive. Some design features from the unsuccessful Apple III lived on in the Apple IIGS, such as GS/OS borrowing elements from SOS (including, by way of ProDOS, the SOS file system), a unique keyboard feature for dual-speed arrow keys, and colorized ASCII text.  Release  An original Apple IIGS \\"Woz Edition\\", with signature on front A close up view of the \\"Woz\\" signature printed on the Limited Edition Apple IIGS During its introduction, Apple sold a specialized set of Bose Roommate speakers that were platinum-colored with the Apple logo next to the Bose on each front speaker grille. An easter egg (activated by Command-Option-Control-N) in ROM 3 lists the members of development team, and plays an audio clip of them shouting \\"Apple II!\\". = Limited Edition (\\"Woz\\"-signed case) = As part of a commemorative celebration marking the 10th anniversary of the Apple II series' development, as well as Apple Computer itself celebrating the same anniversary, a special limited edition was introduced at product launch. The first 50,000 Apple IIGSs manufactured had a reproduced copy of Wozniak's signature (\\"Woz\\") at the front right corner of the case, with a dotted line and the phrase \\"Limited Edition\\" printed just below it. Owners of the Limited Edition, after mailing in their Apple registration card, were mailed back a certificate of authenticity signed by Wozniak and 12 key Apple engineers, as well as a personal letter from Wozniak himself (both machine-reproduced). Because the difference between standard and Limited Edition machines were purely cosmetic, many owners of new were able to \\"convert\\" to the Limited Edition by merely swapping the case lid from an older (and likely nonfunctional) machine. While of nostalgic value to Apple II users and collectors, presently these stamped-lid cases are not considered rare, nor do they have any particular monetary worth.The original Apple II FAQ, the Apple IIGS = Upgrading an Apple IIe = Back view of IIGS upgrade, with the new port openings and connectors Upon its release in September 1986, Apple announced it would be making a kit that would upgrade an Apple IIe to a IIGS available for purchase. This followed an Apple practice of making logic board upgrades available that dated from the earliest days of the Apple II until Steve Jobs' return to Apple in 1997. The IIe-to-IIGS upgrade replaced the IIe motherboard with a 16-bit IIGS motherboard. Users would take their Apple IIe machines into an authorized Apple dealership, where the IIe motherboard and lower baseboard of the case were swapped for an Apple IIGS motherboard with a new baseboard (with matching cut-outs for the new built-in ports). New metal sticker ID badges replaced those on the front of the IIe, rebranding the machine. Retained were the upper half of the IIe case, the keyboard, speaker and power supply. Original IIGS motherboards (those produced between 1986 and mid-1989) have electrical connections for the IIe power supply and keyboard present, although only about half of those produced have the physical plug connectors factory-presoldered in, which were mostly reserved for the upgrade kits. The replacement nameplates for the front lid, used in the Apple IIe-to-IIGS upgrade The upgrade cost US$500, plus the trade- in of the user's existing Apple IIe motherboard. It did not include a mouse, and the keyboard, although functional, lacked a numeric keypad and did not mimic all the features and functions of the Apple Desktop Bus keyboard. Some cards designed for the GS did not fit in the Apple IIe's slanted case. In the end, most users found that the upgrade did not save them much money once they purchased a 3.5-inch floppy drive, analog RGB monitor, and mouse.  Software features  Software that runs on the Apple IIGS can be divided into two major categories: 8-bit software compatible with earlier Apple II systems such as the IIe and IIc, and 16-bit IIGS software, which takes advantage of its advanced features, including a near-clone of the Macintosh graphical user interface. = 8-bit Apple II compatibility = Apple claimed that the IIGS was 95% compatible with contemporary Apple II software. One reviewer, for example, successfully ran demo programs that came on cassette with his 1977 Apple II. The IIGS can run all of Apple's earlier Apple II operating systems: Apple DOS, ProDOS 8, and Apple Pascal. It is also compatible with nearly all 8-bit software running on those systems. Like the Apple II+, IIe, and IIc, the IIGS also includes Applesoft BASIC and a machine-language monitor (which can be used for very simple assembly language programming) in ROM, so they can be used even with no operating system loaded from disk. The 8-bit software runs twice as fast unless the user turns down the processor speed in the IIGS control panel. = System Software = The Apple IIGS System Software utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) very similar to that of the Macintosh and somewhat like GEM for PCs and the operating systems of contemporary Atari and Amiga computers. Early versions of the System Software are based on the ProDOS 16 operating system, which is based on the original ProDOS operating system for 8-bit Apple II computers. Although it was modified so that 16-bit Apple IIGS software can run on it, ProDOS 16 was written largely in 8-bit code and does not take full advantage of the IIGS's capabilities. Later System Software versions (starting with version 4.0) replaced ProDOS 16 with a new 16-bit operating system known as GS/OS. It better utilizes the unique capabilities of the IIGS and includes many valuable new features. The IIGS System Software was substantially enhanced and expanded over the years during which it was developed, culminating in its final official version, System 6.0.1, which was released in 1993. In July 2015, members of a computer group from France released a new, though unofficial, version of that System Software, dubbed \\"System 6.0.2\\" (and later followed by System 6.0.3 and 6.0.4), that primarily fixed some bugs.  Graphical user interface  Similar to that of the Macintosh, the IIGS System Software provides a mouse-driven graphical user interface using concepts such as windows, menus, and icons. This was implemented by a \\"toolbox\\" of code, some of which resides in the computer's ROM and some of which is loaded from disk. Only one major application can run at a time, although other, smaller programs, known as Desk Accessories, can be used simultaneously. The IIGS has a Finder application very similar to the Macintosh's, which allows the user to manipulate files and launch applications. By default, the Finder is displayed when the computer starts up and whenever the user quits an application that is started from it, although the startup application can be changed by the user. Software companies complained that Apple did not provide technical information and development tools to create IIGS-specific software. In 1988 Compute! reported that both Cinemaware and Intergalactic Development had to write their own tools to maximize their use of IIGS audio, with the latter stating that \\"these sorts of problems ‚Ä¶ are becoming well-known throughout the industry\\".  Extensibility  The IIGS System Software can be extended through various mechanisms. New Desk Accessories are small programs ranging from a calculator to simple word processors that can be used while running any standard desktop application. Classic Desk Accessories also serve as small programs available while running other applications, but they use the text screen and can be accessed even from non-desktop applications. Control Panels and initialization files are other mechanisms that allow various functions to be added to the system. Finder Extras permits new capabilities to be added to the Finder, drivers can be used to support new hardware devices, and users can also add \\"tools\\" that provide various functions that other programs can utilize easily. These features can be used to provide features that were never planned for by the system's designers, such as a TCP/IP stack known as \\"Marinetti\\". = Multitasking capability = A third party UNIX-like multitasking kernel was produced, called GNO/ME, which runs under the GUI and provides preemptive multitasking. In addition, a system called The Manager can be used to make the Finder more like the one on the Macintosh, allowing major software (other than just the \\"accessory\\" programs) to run simultaneously through cooperative multitasking. Reception After previewing the computer, BYTE stated in October 1986 that \\"The Apple IIGS designers' achievements are remarkable, but the burden of the classic Apple II architecture, now as venerable (and outdated) as COBOL and batch processing, may have weighed them down and denied them any technological leaps beyond an exercise in miniaturization.\\" The magazine added that \\"hog-tied by [classic] Apple II compatibility, [the IIGS] approaches but does not match or exceed current computer capabilities\\" of the Macintosh, Commodore Amiga, or Atari ST, and predicted that many vendors would \\"enhance existing products for the [classic] Apple II instead of writing new software\\" that fully exploited the IIGS's power. inCider, which in September had warned that the next Apple II \\"needs (at least)... a megabyte of RAM... That's what the market wants\\", indeed reported in November that \\"Rather than risk investing time and money in programs that work only on the Apple IIGS, a number of software developers have simply upgraded old Apple II programs\\", and that the \\"most interesting program available specifically for the IIGS at this time is LearningWays' Explore-a-Story, which was released simultaneously for the good old 128K Apple IIe and IIc\\". The magazine concluded, \\"The moral is simple: Good hardware, even innovative hardware, won't give birth to good, new software overnight.\\" Nibble was more positive, calling the price \\"fantastic\\" for \\"Steve Wozniak's dream machine\\". It praised the IIGS's \\"incredible\\" legacy Apple II compatibility, graphics, and sound, stated that only its slower speed made the computer significantly inferior to the Macintosh, and expected that Apple would soon introduce new products to better distinguish the two product lines. The magazine concluded that \\"The IIGS is an incredibly fine computer, arguably the finest assemblage of chips and resistors ever soldered together... Ladies and gentlemen of Apple, on behalf of the Apple II user community, you have earned our gratitude and admiration.\\" Compute! described the IIGS in November 1986 as \\"two machines in one‚Äîa product that bridges the gap between the Macintosh and Apple IIe, and in so doing poses what may be serious competition for the Commodore Amiga and the Atari ST series\\". It described the IIGS's graphics \\"as different as night and day\\" from the earlier Apple IIs and the audio as \\"in a class by themselves... [it] justifies the price of the IIGS to many music fans and fanatics\\". The magazine reported that \\"well over one hundred outside developers were actively engaged in creating software for the IIGS\\", and predicted that \\"as new products are developed to take advantage of the IIGS, people will move away from the pure Apple II and toward the newer titles with their improved performance\\". Compute!'s Apple Applications in December 1987 reported, however, that \\"Many publishers have canceled or postponed their plans for Apple IIGS software and instead are cautiously introducing programs for the Apple IIc and IIe\\", while \\"many of the products for the Apple IIGS are simply versions of\\" older Apple II software \\"that incorporate color and use the mouse interface\\". So little IIGS software was available, it said, that \\"the hottest product... is AppleWorks. No mouse interface, no color, no graphics. Just AppleWorks from the IIe and IIc world\\". The magazine stated that many customers either chose the slightly more expensive Macintosh Plus or kept their inexpensive IIc or IIe which ran AppleWorks well, with the IIGS \\"in a strange position\\" in between. BYTEs Bruce Webster in January 1987 praised Apple for permitting Wozniak to finish the IIx project, but said that the company should have done so \\"a few years ago\\". The IIGS is an excellent replacement for the [earlier models from the] Apple II line, but it's awfully late in coming. The technology is more trailing-edge than leading-edge in many areas\\", with speed and graphics inferior to that of the Amiga and Atari ST. The other computers, he wrote, have both larger software libraries that use their power and lower prices; Webster found that a IIGS package costing $2500 was comparable to a $1500 Atari ST configuration. He concluded with a \\"qualified approval\\" of the computer: \\"It was necessary to prevent the Apple II line from dying off during the next year or so. However, Apple didn't go far enough.\\" A BYTE review in April 1987 concluded that the IIGS \\"has the potential to be a powerful computer\\" but needed a faster CPU and more addressable memory. The magazine advised potential customers to compare the Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari ST's more powerful 68000 CPU with the IIGS's greater expandability and large Apple II software library. Compute! in 1988 urged Apple to make the computer faster, stating that \\"no matter which way you cut it, the IIGS is slow\\" and that IIGS-specific programs could not keep up with user actions. In 1989 the magazine stated \\"One of the biggest complaints of IIGS-specific software is the way it imitates the pace of a zombie. You'd think 16-bit software had died and voodoo-transformed into a shuffling, stumbling imitation of real computer applications.\\" It reported that year that after increases in September, a IIGS with color monitor, two disk drives, and ImageWriter II cost more than $3,000, a price the magazine called \\"staggering\\". inCider also criticized the price increase, warning that it \\"opens the door further to low-cost MS-DOS computers\\".

During those years, however, Apple did produce some maintenance updates to the system which mainly comprised two new ROM-based updates and a revamped motherboard. It is rumored that several prototypes that greatly enhanced the machine's features and capabilities were designed and even built, though only one has ever been publicly exposed (i.e. the \\"Mark Twain\\"). Outlined below are only those revisions and updates officially released by Apple. = Original firmware release (\\"ROM version 00\\") = During the entire first year of the machine's production an early, almost beta-like, firmware version shipped with the machine and was notably bug- ridden. Some limitation of this include the fact that the built-in RAM Disk can't be set larger than 4 MB (even if more RAM is present) and the firmware contains the very early System 1.x toolsets. It became incompatible with most native Apple IIGS software written from late-1987 onward, and OS support only lasted up to System 3. The startup splash screen of the original ROM only displays the words \\"Apple IIgs\\" at the top center of the screen, in the same fashion that previous Apple II models identify themselves. = Video Graphics Controller (VGC) replacement = Very early production runs of the machine had a faulty video graphics controller (VGC) chip that produced strange cosmetic glitches in emulated (IIe/IIc) video modes. Specifically, the 80-column text display and monochrome double-high-resolution graphics had a symptom where small flickering or static pink bits would appear between the gaps of characters and pixels. Most users noticed this when using AppleWorks classic or the Mousedesk application that was a part of System 1 and 2. Apple resolved the issue by offering a free chip-swap upgrade to affected owners. = Second firmware release (\\"ROM version 01\\") = In August 1987, Apple released an updated ROM that was included in all new machines and was made available as a free upgrade to all existing owners. The main feature of the new ROM was the presence of the System 2.x toolsets and several bug fixes. The upgrade was vital, as software developers, including Apple, ceased support of the original ROM upon its release (most native Apple IIGS software written from late-1987 onwards would not run unless a ROM 01 or higher was present, and this included the GS/OS operating system). This update also allows up to 8 MB for the RAM Disk, added some new features for programmers, and reported the ROM version and copyright information on the startup splash screen. = Standard RAM increased to 512 KB = In March 1988, Apple began shipping IIGS units with 512 KB of RAM as standard. This was done by preinstalling the Apple IIGS Memory Expansion Card (that was once sold separately) in the memory expansion slot‚Äîthe card had 256 KB of RAM on board with empty sockets for further expansion. The built-in memory on the motherboard remained at 256 KB and existing users were not offered this upgrade. = Third firmware release (\\"ROM version 3\\"); 1 MB of RAM = In August 1989, Apple increased the standard amount of RAM shipped in the IIGS to 1.125 MB. This time the additional memory was built-in on the motherboard, which required a layout change and allowed for other minor improvements as well. This update introduced both a new motherboard and a new ROM firmware update; however, neither was offered to existing owners‚Äîeven as an upgrade option (the new ROM, now two chips, is incompatible with the original single-socket motherboard). Apple had cited the reason an upgrade was not being offered was that most of the features of the new machine could be obtained in existing machines by installing System 5 and a fully populated Apple IIGS Memory Expansion Card. The new ROM firmware was expanded to 256 KB and contained the System 5.x toolsets. The newer toolsets increased the performance of the machine by up to 10%, due to the fact that less had to be loaded from disk, tool ROM read access being faster than RAM, and their highly optimized routines compared to the older toolsets (pre-GS/OS- based). In addition to several bug fixes, also added were more programmer assistance commands and features, a cleaned-up control panel with improved mouse control and RAM Disk functionality, more flexible Appletalk support and slot-mapping. In terms of hardware, the new motherboard is a cleaner design that drew less power and resolved audio noise issues that interfered with the Ensoniq synthesizer in the original motherboard. Over four times more RAM is built-in, with double the ROM size, and an enhanced Apple Desktop Bus microcontroller provides native support for sticky keys, mouse emulation, and keyboard LED support (available on extended keyboards). Hardware shadowing of Text Page 2 was introduced, improving compatibility and performance with the classic Apple II video mode. The clock battery is now user-serviceable, being placed in a removable socket, and a jumper location was added to lock out the text-based control panel (mainly useful in school environments). Support for the Apple-IIe-to-IIGS upgrade was removed, and some cost-cutting measures had some chips soldered in place rather than being socketed. As the firmware only worked in this motherboard and no new firmware updates were ever issued, users commonly referred to this version of the IIGS as the \\"ROM 3\\".  International versions  Like the Apple IIe and Apple IIc built-in keyboards before it, the detached IIGS keyboard differs depending on what region of the world it was sold in, with extra local language characters and symbols printed on certain keycaps (e.g. French accented characters on the Canadian IIGS keyboard such as \\"√†\\", \\"√©\\", \\"√ß\\", etc., or the British Pound \\"¬£\\" symbol on the UK IIGS keyboard). Unlike previous Apple II models, however, the layout and shape of keys were the same standard for all countries, and the ROMs inside the computer were also the same for all countries, including support for all the different international keyboards. In order to access the local character set layout and display, users would change settings in the built-in software-based control panel, which also provides a method of toggling between 50/60 Hz video screen refresh. The composite video output is NTSC-only on all IIGS systems; users in PAL countries are expected to use an RGB monitor or TVs which featured RGB SCART. This selectable internationalization makes it quick and simple to localize any given machine. Also present in the settings is a QWERTY/DVORAK keyboard toggle for all countries, much like that of the Apple IIc. Outside North America, the Apple IIGS shipped with a different 220 V clip-in power supply, making this and the plastic keycaps the only physical differences (and also very modular, in the sense of converting a non-localized machine to a local one).  Gus  Apple designed the Apple IIe Card to transit Apple IIe customers to the Macintosh LC, particularly schools who had a large investment in Apple II software. While Apple discussed creating an LC plug-in IIGS card, they felt that the cost of selling it would be as much as an entire LC and abandoned it. However, the educational community had a substantial investment in the IIGS software as well, which made upgrading to a Macintosh a less attractive proposition than had been for the Apple IIe. As a result, Apple software designers Dave Lyons and Andy Nicholas spearheaded a program to develop a IIGS software emulator they called Gus in their spare time, which would run on the Power Macintosh only. Apple did not officially support the project. Nevertheless, seeing the need to help switch their educational customers to the Macintosh (as well as sell Power Macs), Apple unofficially distributed the software for free to schools and other institutions that signed a non-disclosure agreement. It was never offered for public sale, but is now readily available on the internet, along with many third-party classic Apple II emulators. Gus represents one of the few software emulators developed within Apple (officially or otherwise), including MacWorks and Mac OS X Classic environment. The app was publicly demonstrated in Rhapsody's Blue Box at WWDC 1997.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY597IUP3Oc&feature;=youtu.be&t;=2419  Legacy  The Apple Desktop Bus, which for a long time was the standard for most input peripherals for the Macintosh, first appeared on the IIGS. In addition, the other standardized ports and addition of SCSI set a benchmark which allowed, for the first time, Apple to consolidate their peripheral offerings across both the Apple II and Macintosh product lines, permitting one device to be compatible with multiple, disparate computers. The IIGS is also the first Apple product to bear the new brand-unifying color scheme, a warm gray color Apple dubbed \\"Platinum\\". This color would remain the Apple standard used on the vast majority of all products for the next decade. The IIGS is also the second major computer design after the Apple IIc by Apple's outsourced industrial designer Frogdesign and together with its new corporate color and matching peripherals, officially ushered in the Snow White design language which was used exclusively for the next five years and made the Apple product line instantly recognizable around the world. The inclusion of a professional-grade sound chip in the Apple IIGS was hailed by both developers and users, and hopes were high that it would be added to the Macintosh; however, it drew a lawsuit from Apple Records. As part of an earlier trademark dispute with the record company, Apple Computer had agreed not to release music-related products. Apple Records considered the inclusion of the Ensoniq chip in the IIGS a violation of that agreement. = Developers = John Carmack, co-founder of id Software, started his career by writing commercial software for the Apple IIGS, working with John Romero and Tom Hall. Wolfenstein 3D, based on the 1981 Apple II game Castle Wolfenstein, came full- circle when it was released for the Apple IIGS in 1998. Two mainstream video games, Zany Golf and The Immortal, both designed by Will Harvey, originated as Apple IIGS games that were ported to other platforms, including the Sega Genesis. Pangea Software started as an Apple IIGS game developer. Naughty Dog started with the classic Apple II machines, but later developed for the IIGS.  Rumors and canceled developments  In August 1988, inCider magazine reported Apple was working on a new Apple IIGS. It was stated it had a faster CPU, improved graphics (double the vertical resolution, 256 colors per scanline and 4,096 colors per screen), 768 kB of RAM, 256 kB of ROM, 128 kB of sound DOC-RAM and a built-in SCSI port. No new machine would appear that year. In 1989 Compute! reported on speculation that Apple would announce at the May AppleFest a \\"IIGS Plus\\" with a processor two to three times faster, 768 kB to 1 MB RAM, and a SCSI port. The speculation was partially based on Apple CEO John Sculley stating that the IIGS would receive a new CPU in 1989. No new computer appeared, but in August the IIGS started shipping with 1 MB RAM in the base configuration. VTech, makers of the 8-bit Apple II-compatible Laser 128, announced plans for a IIGS-compatible computer in 1988 for under $600. They demonstrated a prototype in 1989, but the computer was never released. Cirtech started work on, but never completed, a black-and-white Macintosh hardware emulation plug-in card for the IIGS dubbed \\"Duet\\". Using a 68020 processor, custom ROM and up to 8 MB RAM, Cirtech claimed it would outperform the Macintosh IIcx.http://www.goldstarsoftware.com/applesite/OpenAppleNewsletter/Vol6No07.PDF  See also  * Apple IIc Plus * Juiced.GS, the last Apple II publication * KansasFest, an annual convention for Apple II users * List of Apple IIGS games  References   External links  * \\"The New Apple IIGS\\" from Compute! magazine (November 1986) * Apple II History from Steven Weyhrich * What is the Apple IIGS, reviews of many Apple IIGS applications GS Snow White design language Computer-related introductions in 1986 fr:Apple II#Apple IIGS (Septembre 1986) ","title":"Apple IIGS"},{"id":"248102","text":"In mathematics, a measurable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number. In order to define the concept, one introduces a two-valued measure on a cardinal , or more generally on any set. For a cardinal , it can be described as a subdivision of all of its subsets into large and small sets such that itself is large, and all singletons are small, complements of small sets are large and vice versa. The intersection of fewer than large sets is again large. It turns out that uncountable cardinals endowed with a two-valued measure are large cardinals whose existence cannot be proved from ZFC. The concept of a measurable cardinal was introduced by Stanislaw Ulam in 1930.  Definition  Formally, a measurable cardinal is an uncountable cardinal number Œ∫ such that there exists a Œ∫-additive, non-trivial, 0-1-valued measure on the power set of Œ∫. (Here the term Œ∫-additive means that, for any sequence AŒ±, Œ±<Œª of cardinality Œª < Œ∫, AŒ± being pairwise disjoint sets of ordinals less than Œ∫, the measure of the union of the AŒ± equals the sum of the measures of the individual AŒ±.) Equivalently, Œ∫ is measurable means that it is the critical point of a non-trivial elementary embedding of the universe V into a transitive class M. This equivalence is due to Jerome Keisler and Dana Scott, and uses the ultrapower construction from model theory. Since V is a proper class, a technical problem that is not usually present when considering ultrapowers needs to be addressed, by what is now called Scott's trick. Equivalently, Œ∫ is a measurable cardinal if and only if it is an uncountable cardinal with a Œ∫-complete, non-principal ultrafilter. Again, this means that the intersection of any strictly less than Œ∫-many sets in the ultrafilter, is also in the ultrafilter.  Properties  Although it follows from ZFC that every measurable cardinal is inaccessible (and is ineffable, Ramsey, etc.), it is consistent with ZF that a measurable cardinal can be a successor cardinal. It follows from ZF + axiom of determinacy that œâ1 is measurable, and that every subset of œâ1 contains or is disjoint from a closed and unbounded subset. Ulam showed that the smallest cardinal Œ∫ that admits a non-trivial countably- additive two-valued measure must in fact admit a Œ∫-additive measure. (If there were some collection of fewer than Œ∫ measure-0 subsets whose union was Œ∫, then the induced measure on this collection would be a counterexample to the minimality of Œ∫.) From there, one can prove (with the Axiom of Choice) that the least such cardinal must be inaccessible. It is trivial to note that if Œ∫ admits a non-trivial Œ∫-additive measure, then Œ∫ must be regular. (By non- triviality and Œ∫-additivity, any subset of cardinality less than Œ∫ must have measure 0, and then by Œ∫-additivity again, this means that the entire set must not be a union of fewer than Œ∫ sets of cardinality less than Œ∫.) Finally, if Œª < Œ∫, then it can't be the case that Œ∫ ‚â§ 2Œª. If this were the case, then we could identify Œ∫ with some collection of 0-1 sequences of length Œª. For each position in the sequence, either the subset of sequences with 1 in that position or the subset with 0 in that position would have to have measure 1\\\\. The intersection of these Œª-many measure 1 subsets would thus also have to have measure 1, but it would contain exactly one sequence, which would contradict the non-triviality of the measure. Thus, assuming the Axiom of Choice, we can infer that Œ∫ is a strong limit cardinal, which completes the proof of its inaccessibility. If Œ∫ is measurable and p‚ààVŒ∫ and M (the ultrapower of V) satisfies œà(Œ∫,p), then the set of Œ± < Œ∫ such that V satisfies œà(Œ±,p) is stationary in Œ∫ (actually a set of measure 1). In particular if œà is a Œ†1 formula and V satisfies œà(Œ∫,p), then M satisfies it and thus V satisfies œà(Œ±,p) for a stationary set of Œ± < Œ∫. This property can be used to show that Œ∫ is a limit of most types of large cardinals that are weaker than measurable. Notice that the ultrafilter or measure witnessing that Œ∫ is measurable cannot be in M since the smallest such measurable cardinal would have to have another such below it, which is impossible. If one starts with an elementary embedding j1 of V into M1 with critical point Œ∫, then one can define an ultrafilter U on Œ∫ as { S‚äÜŒ∫ : Œ∫‚ààj1(S) }. Then taking an ultrapower of V over U we can get another elementary embedding j2 of V into M2. However, it is important to remember that j2 ‚â† j1. Thus other types of large cardinals such as strong cardinals may also be measurable, but not using the same embedding. It can be shown that a strong cardinal Œ∫ is measurable and also has Œ∫-many measurable cardinals below it. Every measurable cardinal Œ∫ is a 0-huge cardinal because Œ∫M‚äÜM, that is, every function from Œ∫ to M is in M. Consequently, VŒ∫+1‚äÜM.  Real-valued measurable  A cardinal Œ∫ is called real-valued measurable if there is a Œ∫-additive probability measure on the power set of Œ∫ that vanishes on singletons. Real-valued measurable cardinals were introduced by . showed that the continuum hypothesis implies that {\\\\mathfrak c} is not real-valued measurable. showed (see below for parts of Ulam's proof) that real valued measurable cardinals are weakly inaccessible (they are in fact weakly Mahlo). All measurable cardinals are real-valued measurable, and a real-valued measurable cardinal Œ∫ is measurable if and only if Œ∫ is greater than {\\\\mathfrak c} . Thus a cardinal is measurable if and only if it is real-valued measurable and strongly inaccessible. A real valued measurable cardinal less than or equal to {\\\\mathfrak c} exists if and only if there is a countably additive extension of the Lebesgue measure to all sets of real numbers if and only if there is an atomless probability measure on the power set of some non- empty set. showed that existence of measurable cardinals in ZFC, real valued measurable cardinals in ZFC, and measurable cardinals in ZF, are equiconsistent. = Weak inaccessibility of real-valued measurable cardinals = Say that a cardinal number \\\\alpha is an Ulam number ifThe notion in the article Ulam number is different. whenever # \\\\mu is an outer measure on a set X, # \\\\mu(X) < \\\\infty, # \\\\mu(\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}) = 0, x \\\\in X, # all A \\\\subset X are -measurable, then ::\\\\operatorname{card} X \\\\le \\\\alpha\\\\Rightarrow\\\\mu(X) = 0. Equivalently, a cardinal number \\\\alpha is an Ulam number if whenever # u is an outer measure on a set Y, and F a disjoint family of subsets of Y, # u\\\\left(\\\\bigcup F\\\\right) < \\\\infty, # u(A) = 0 for A \\\\in F, # \\\\bigcup G is -measurable for every G \\\\subset F then ::\\\\operatorname{card} F \\\\le \\\\alpha\\\\Rightarrow u\\\\left(\\\\bigcup F\\\\right) = 0. The smallest infinite cardinal \\\\aleph_0 is an Ulam number. The class of Ulam numbers is closed under the cardinal successor operation. If an infinite cardinal \\\\beta has an immediate predecessor \\\\alpha that is an Ulam number, assume \\\\mu satisfies properties with X = \\\\beta. In the von Neumann model of ordinals and cardinals, choose injective functions :f_x:x \\\\rightarrow \\\\alpha, \\\\quad \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\beta, and define the sets :U(b, a) = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\beta: f_x(b) = a\\\\\\\\}, \\\\quad a \\\\in \\\\alpha, b \\\\in \\\\beta. Since the f_x are one-to-one, the sets :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{U(b, a), b\\\\in \\\\beta\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\text{(} a \\\\text{ fixed)}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{U(b, a), a\\\\in \\\\alpha\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\text{(} b \\\\text{ fixed)} are disjoint. By property (2) of \\\\mu, the set :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{b \\\\in \\\\beta: \\\\mu(U(b, a)) > 0\\\\right\\\\\\\\} is countable, and hence :\\\\operatorname{card}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{(b, a) \\\\in \\\\beta \\\\times \\\\alpha \\\\mu(U(b, a)) > 0\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\le \\\\aleph_0 \\\\cdot \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha. Thus there is a b_0 such that :\\\\mu(U(b_0, a)) = 0 \\\\quad \\\\forall a \\\\in \\\\alpha implying, since \\\\alpha is an Ulam number and using the second definition (with u = \\\\mu and conditions fulfilled), :\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{a \\\\in \\\\alpha}U(b_0, a)\\\\right) = 0. If b_0 < x < \\\\beta, then f_x(b_0) = a_x \\\\Rightarrow x\\\\in U(b_0, a_x). Thus :\\\\beta = b_0 \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{b_0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\bigcup_{a \\\\in \\\\alpha}U(b_0, a), By property , \\\\mu\\\\\\\\{b_0\\\\\\\\} = 0, and since \\\\operatorname{card} b_0 \\\\le \\\\alpha, by and , \\\\mu(b_0) = 0. It follows that \\\\mu(\\\\beta) = 0. The conclusion is that \\\\beta is an Ulam number. There is a similar proof that the supremum of a set S of Ulam numbers with \\\\operatorname{card} S an Ulam number is again a Ulam number. Together with the previous result, this implies that a cardinal that is not an Ulam number is weakly inaccessible.

This is achieved by exploring, finding treasure, or waging war by assembling followers, gathering armies, and building citadels. The game was criticized for using a \\"Combat Resolution Table\\" where a player would add the Battle Value of their Army, Hero, Ally, and Artefact (sic) in a given stack, add terrain bonuses, subtracts the defender's total Battle Value, and then compare it to the table to determine the number of cards lost in each stack.

It is a weakening of the notion of a supercompact cardinal.  Formal definition  If Œª is any ordinal, Œ∫ is Œª-strong means that Œ∫ is a cardinal number and there exists an elementary embedding j from the universe V into a transitive inner model M with critical point Œ∫ and :V_\\\\lambda\\\\subseteq M That is, M agrees with V on an initial segment. Then Œ∫ is strong means that it is Œª-strong for all ordinals Œª.  Relationship with other large cardinals  By definitions, strong cardinals lie below supercompact cardinals and above measurable cardinals in the consistency strength hierarchy. Œ∫ is Œ∫-strong if and only if it is measurable. If Œ∫ is strong or Œª-strong for Œª ‚â• Œ∫+2, then the ultrafilter U witnessing that Œ∫ is measurable will be in VŒ∫+2 and thus in M. So for any Œ± < Œ∫, we have that there exist an ultrafilter U in j(VŒ∫) ‚àí j(VŒ±), remembering that j(Œ±) = Œ±. Using the elementary embedding backwards, we get that there is an ultrafilter in VŒ∫ ‚àí VŒ±. So there are arbitrarily large measurable cardinals below Œ∫ which is regular, and thus Œ∫ is a limit of Œ∫-many measurable cardinals. Strong cardinals also lie below superstrong cardinals and Woodin cardinals in consistency strength. However, the least strong cardinal is larger than the least superstrong cardinal. Every strong cardinal is strongly unfoldable and therefore totally indescribable.

He was the father of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the \\"Kingmaker\\". Origins He was born in 1400 at Raby Castle in County Durham, the third son (and tenth child) of Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, but his first son by his second wife, Joan Beaufort, the youngest of the four legitimised children and only daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (third surviving son of King Edward III), by his mistress, later wife, Katherine Swynford. The Neville lands were primarily in County Durham and Yorkshire, but both King Richard II and King Henry IV (Joan's cousin and half-brother respectively) found the family useful to counterbalance the strength of the Percys on the Scottish Borders. This led to Ralph's earldom being granted in 1397, and to his appointment as Warden of the West March in 1403. Ralph's marriage to Joan Beaufort, at a time when the distinction between royalty and nobility was becoming more important, can be seen as another reward; as a granddaughter of King Edward III, she was a member of the royal family. The children of Ralph's first wife, Margaret Stafford, made good marriages to local nobility, and his eldest son had married into royalty in the person of Elizabeth Holland, but his Beaufort children married into even greater families. Three of Richard's sisters married dukes, the youngest Cecily, married Richard, Duke of York. Marriage Richard married Alice Montagu, daughter and heiress of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury. The date of Richard and Alice's marriage is not known, but it must have been before February 1421, when as a married couple they appeared at the coronation of Queen Catherine of Valois. At the time of the marriage, the Salisbury inheritance was not guaranteed, as not only was Thomas Montacute still alive, but in 1424 he remarried (to Alice Chaucer, granddaughter of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer). This second marriage was without issue and when the Thomas Montagu died in 1428, Richard Neville and Alice were confirmed as the Earl and Countess of Salisbury. From this point on, Richard Neville will be referred to as Salisbury. Salisbury came into possession of greater estates than, as a younger son under primogeniture, he could reasonably have expected. Strangely, his eldest half-brother John Neville apparently agreed to many of the rights to the Neville inheritance being transferred to his step-mother Joan Beaufort, and her son Salisbury inherited these on her death in 1440. He also gained possession of the lands and grants made jointly to Ralph and Joan. Ralph's heir (his grandson Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland) as the representative of the senior line, disputed the loss of his inheritance, and although he agreed to a settlement in 1443, it was on unequal terms ‚Äì Salisbury kept the great Neville possessions of Middleham and Sheriff Hutton, as well as the more recent grant of Penrith. Only Raby Castle, the family's most ancient possession, returned to the senior branch. The resultant Neville‚ÄìNeville feud was later to become absorbed into the destructive Percy-Neville feud. Salisbury's marriage gained him his wife's quarter share of the Holland inheritance. Ironically, his Salisbury title came with comparatively little in terms of wealth, though he did gain a more southerly residence at Bisham Manor in Berkshire. Warden of the West March The defence of the Scottish Border was carried out by two Wardens‚Äì that of the East March (based at Berwick-upon-Tweed) and that of the West March at Carlisle. Both offices had been held by the Percy family in the fourteenth century, and their support of King Henry IV seemed to have paid off in 1399, when Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland was appointed Warden of the West March and his son Henry Percy (\\"Hotspur\\") as Warden of the East March. But Hotspur rebelled, and his father was held to be complicit in his treason. After Hotspur was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, Ralph Neville was employed by King Henry V to capture the elder Percy. His reward was to succeed the Percys as Warden of both Marches. Under King Henry V, the Percys were restored to their lands, and eventually in 1417, to the East March. The West March, however, was to become an almost hereditary Neville appointment. Salisbury became Warden of the West March in 1420. It was one of the most valuable appointments in England, worth ¬£1,500 in peacetime and four times that if war broke out with Scotland. Although, unlike Calais, it did not require a permanent garrison, the incessant raiding and border skirmishes meant that there would always be a ready supply of trained and experienced soldiers at the Warden's command. Salisbury must have been high in Henry V's estimation, as he was also appointed Justice of the Peace in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham. In 1431 he accompanied the young King Henry VI to France for his coronation, and on his return was made Warden of the East March. In 1436 he resigned both posts, although this may have originally intended as a means of forcing the crown to make good its arrears of payment. When his resignation was accepted, he accompanied his brother-in-law Richard, Duke of York, to France, taking 1,300 men-at-arms and archers with him. He returned the following year, and in November became a member of the King's Council. He did not resume either of the Wardenships, as the Percy-Neville dispute took up most of his time, but when this was resolved in 1443 he resumed the Wardenship of the West March. Although this was at a reduced fee of just under ¬£1,000, the money was secured on specific sources of Crown income, not on the frequently uncollectable tallies. This may reflect his experiences of 1436. Neville and Percy At the end of 1443, from his principal seat at Middleham Castle in Wensleydale, Salisbury could look with some satisfaction at his position. He was a member of the King's Council and Warden of the West March. His brother Robert Neville was the Bishop of Durham, and another of his brothers, William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent, had the custody of Roxburgh Castle. He had seven children, four boys and three girls. In 1436 the two oldest children, Cicely and Richard, made excellent marriages to the son and daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick. It was becoming apparent that the rise of the Nevilles was coming to an end. The king, who during the late 1430s had started to exercise personal rule, was more concerned to promote the fortunes of his closest relatives ‚Äì and Salisbury was only related by a junior, legitimised and female line. In this context, the local rivalry between the Nevilles and the Percys in the north of England was likely to take on greater importance. A strong and capable ruler would be able to control such feuds, or even profit by them. A weak king could find the disputes spreading from local to regional or national conflict. KG The Percys had lands throughout northern England, while the northern lands of the Nevilles were concentrated in north Yorkshire and in County Durham. As Warden of the West March, Salisbury was in a position to exert great power in the north-west, in spite of holding only Kendal and Penrith. The Percys resented the fact that their tenants in Cumberland and Westmorland were being recruited by Salisbury, who even with the reduced grant of 1443 still had great spending power in the region. The senior Neville line (now related by marriage to the Percys) still resented the inequitable settlement of their inheritance dispute. The fifteenth century could be regarded as the peak of \\"bastard feudalism\\" ‚Äì when every subject needed a \\"good lord\\". In return for a commitment by the retained man to provide (usually) military support, the lord would give his retainer a small annual fee, a badge or item of clothing to mark his loyalty (livery) and provide help for him in his disputes with his neighbours (maintenance). Northern England was a long way from the Palace of Westminster, and rapid legal redress for wrongs was impossible.Robert Crackenthorpe murder case is given as an example of corrupt local justice With his economic power as Warden, Salisbury could provide better support for Percy tenants than Northumberland, unpaid in regard to the East March for years, could hope to. In 1448, during the renewal of the war with Scotland, Northumberland took his forces through Salisbury's West March ‚Äì a grave breach of etiquette. Northumberland was defeated at the Battle of Sark, and his son Henry Percy, Lord Poynings was captured. The fact that Salisbury lost 2,000 horses trying to respond to this attack, and was then excluded (along with Northumberland) from the subsequent peace negotiations, can only have inflamed relations between the two families. Over time, the ill will might have receded, but Northumberland's second son, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, spent the next few years stirring up trouble in Yorkshire ‚Äì particularly at York, situated between the Percy estates of Spofforth and Healaugh, and Neville's castle at Sheriff Hutton. On 24 August 1453, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, assembled a force of men-at-arms and archers perhaps as large as 1,000 strong, intending to waylay Salisbury and his family at Heworth Moor, outside York, as he made for Sheriff Hutton. Salisbury had been attending the wedding of his son Thomas in Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, and although his escort would have been smaller, it would have been better armed than Egremont's York craftsmen and tradesmen. Salisbury and his retinue fought them back, arriving unscathed at Sheriff Hutton, but the episode marked the beginning of what was virtually a private war. The bride, Maud Stanhope, was the widow of Lord Willoughby of Eresby, his son would become a Yorkist. Another of the Yorkist party, John Neville, was later Lord Montagu. Maud was due to inherit the manors of Wressle and Burwell from her uncle, Lord Cromwell, who had obtained them from the Percys through litigation. Historian John Sadler argues this was the first incident in the Yorkist/Lancastrian affinities lawless squabble leading to civil war. Neville and York Salisbury changed his allegiance to Richard, Duke of York, who made him Lord Chancellor in 1455. This enabled Salisbury to advance the interests of his retainers against the Percies, for example Thomas de la More petitioned against Lord Egremont, whom de la More claimed had threatened to kill him years earlier. When King Henry VI tried to assert his independence and dismiss York as Protector, Salisbury joined him in fighting at the First Battle of St Albans, claiming that he was acting in self-defence. In 1458 he participated in The Love Day, an attempt at reconciliation held in London. After the Battle of Blore Heath, in which he was notably successful, Salisbury escaped to Calais, having been specifically excluded from a royal pardon. He was slain on 30‚Äì31 December 1460, the night after the Battle of Wakefield. Death and burial After the defeat of the Yorkists at the Battle of Wakefield, Salisbury himself escaped the battlefield but was captured during the night. Upon discovery, battle worn and now a traitor to the realm, he was taken to the Lancastrian camp. Although due to his great wealth the Lancastrian nobles might have been prepared to allow Salisbury to ransom himself, he was nevertheless dragged out of Pontefract Castle and beheaded by the local population, to whom he had been a harsh overlord. He was buried first at Pontefract, but his sons transferred his body to the family mausoleum at Bisham Priory in Berkshire where they erected a monument to his memory. The effigy from this was brought to St Mary's Church at Burghfield, near Reading, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The effigy of a lady alongside him wears a headdress which is not thought to be of the right date to be his wife, but she may represent one of the earlier Countesses of Salisbury buried at Bisham.

Life and career Keel was born in Hornell, New York, the son of a small-time bandleader. His parents separated and he was raised by his grandparents. He was interested in magic and had his first story published in a magicians' magazine at age 12. He left school at the age of 16 after taking all the science courses. He worked as a freelance contributor to newspapers, scriptwriter for local radio and television outlets, and author of pulp articles such as \\"Are You A Repressed Sex Fiend?\\" He served in the US Army during the Korean War on the staff of the American Forces Network at Frankfurt, Germany. He claimed that while in the Army he was trained in psychological warfare as a propaganda writer.Operation Trojan Horse, 1996, p. 267. After leaving the military he worked as a foreign radio correspondent in Paris, Berlin, Rome and Egypt. In 1957, he published Jadoo, a book describing his time in Egypt and India investigating the Indian rope trick and the legendary yeti. In 1966 he produced the \\"spy and superhero\\" spoof novel The Fickle Finger of Fate. Influenced by writers such as Charles Fort, he began contributing articles to Flying Saucer Review and took up investigating UFOs and assorted Forteana as a full-time pursuit. Keel analyzed what he called \\"windows\\" and \\"waves\\" (or flaps, as they are often called) of reported UFO events, concluding that a disproportionate number occurred on Wednesdays and Saturdays. A member of the Screenwriters Guild, Keel reportedly wrote scripts for Get Smart, The Monkees, Mack & Myer for Hire, and Lost in Space. In 1967, Keel popularized the term \\"men In black\\" in an article for the men's adventure magazine Saga, entitled \\"UFO Agents of Terror\\". According to Keel, he initially sought to explain UFOs as extraterrestrial visitations, but later abandoned this hypothesis. His third book, UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse, published in 1970, linked UFOs to supernatural concepts such as monsters, ghosts and demons. Keel used the term \\"ultraterrestrials\\" to describe UFO occupants he believed to be non-human entities capable of taking on whatever form they want. His 1975 book The Mothman Prophecies was Keel's account of his investigation into alleged sightings in West Virginia of a huge, winged creature called \\"Mothman.\\" The book combines Keel's account of receiving strange phone calls with reports of mutilated pets and culminates with the December 15, 1967, collapse of the Silver Bridge across the Ohio River. The book was widely popularized as the basis of a 2002 film of the same name starring Richard Gere. Prolific and imaginative, Keel was considered a significant influence within the UFO and Fortean genre. Keel lived for many years in the Upper West Side of New York City. He was a bachelor. He died on July 3, 2009 in New York City, at the age of 79.

It was established in 1897. International Paper & Power Co. purchased The Record in 1929 from R. Charlton Wright, who had been principal owner since 1918.

One of the quirks of the paper was that it printed the weekly entertainment section on green newsprint. The decision to close The Record was the natural outgrowth of the decline of afternoon papers nationally. By 1987, the paper's circulation was only 27,000 of which only 15,000 were exclusive Record subscribers. The rest also subscribed to The State.

He was a younger son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and the younger brother of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, the \\"Kingmaker\\". From an early age he was involved in fighting for his House, particularly in the feud that sprang up in the 1450s with the Neville family's major regional rivals, the Percy family. John Neville was personally responsible for much of the violence until, with his brothers, they defeated and imprisoned their enemies. This was taking place against the backdrop of a crisis in central government. The king, Henry VI, already known to be a weak ruler, suffered a mental collapse which led to a protectorate headed by John's uncle, Richard, Duke of York. Within two years an armed conflict had broken out, with York openly in rebellion against the king, and his Neville cousins supporting him. John fought with his father and Warwick against the king at the first Battle of St Albans, at which they had the victory. Following a few years of uneasy peace, the Yorkists' rebellion erupted once again, and John Neville fought alongside his father and elder brother Thomas at the Battle of Blore Heath in September 1459. Although the Earl of Salisbury fought off the Lancastrians, both his sons were captured, and John, with Thomas, spent the next year imprisoned. Following his release in 1460, he took part in the Yorkist government. His father and brother died in battle just after Christmas 1460, and in February the next year, John ‚Äì now promoted to the peerage as Lord Montagu ‚Äì and Warwick fought the Lancastrians again at St Albans. John was once again captured and not released until his cousin Edward, York's son, won a decisive victory at Towton in March 1461, and became King Edward IV. John Neville soon emerged, with Warwick, as representatives of the king's power in the north, which was still politically turbulent, as there were still a large number of Lancastrians on the loose attempting to raise rebellion against the new regime. As his brother Warwick became more involved in national politics and central government, it devolved to John to finally defeat the last remnants of Lancastrians in 1464. Following these victories, Montagu, in what has been described as a high point for his House, was created Earl of Northumberland. At around the same time, however, his brother Warwick became increasingly dissatisfied with his relationship with the king, and began instigating rebellions against Edward IV in the north, finally capturing him in July 1469. At first, Montagu helped suppress this discontent, and also encouraged Warwick to release Edward. Eventually, however, his brother went into French exile with the king's brother George, Duke of Clarence, in March 1470. During Warwick's exile, King Edward stripped Montagu of the Earldom of Northumberland, making him Marquis of Montagu instead. John Neville appears to have seen this as a reduction in rank, and accepted it with poor grace. He seems particularly to have complained about the lack of landed estate that his new marquisate brought with it, calling it a \\"pie's nest\\". When the Earl of Warwick and Clarence returned, they distracted Edward with a rebellion in the north, which the king ordered Montagu to raise troops to repress in the king's name. Montagu, however, having raised a small army, turned against Edward, almost capturing him at Olney, Buckinghamshire; the king, with his other brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled into exile in Burgundy. While in exile, Warwick had allied with the old king, Henry VI and his Queen, Margaret of Anjou, Henry was restored to the throne, and Warwick now effectively ruled the kingdom, This return to Lancastrianism did not, however, last long; within the year, Edward and Gloucester had returned. Landing only a few miles from Montagu in Yorkshire ‚Äì who did nothing to stop them ‚Äì the Yorkists marched south, raising an army. Montagu followed them, and, meeting up with his brother at Coventry, they confronted Edward over a battlefield at Barnet. John Neville was cut down in the fighting, Warwick died soon after, and within a month Edward had reclaimed his throne and Henry VI and his line was extinguished. Youth and early career Montagu was the third son of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury, and a younger brother of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, \\"the Kingmaker.\\" John Neville's upbringing and career was entwined with that of the north of England and specifically, the marcher areas, the eastern and western borders between Scotland and England, controlled from Berwick and Carlisle respectively. His Early activity there consisted of diplomatic meetings with the Scots, at which he acted as a witness, between 1449 and 1451. He was also one of three men who were instructed, in a letter of 3 February 1449, to not attend the forthcoming parliament and remain in the north guarding the border. He was knighted by King Henry VI at Greenwich on 5 January 1453, alongside Edmund and Jasper Tudor, his brother Thomas Neville, William Herbert, Roger Lewknor, and William Catesby. Middleham Castle today; this was his father's caput. = Feud with the Percys = Sir John Neville was from the branch of the Neville family based at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire, rather than that of Westmorland. It has been claimed that he, as a \\"landless younger son\\" was partially to blame for his family's long-running feud with the Lancastrian Percy family of Northumberland. The first outburst of violence that took place was a result of the 1 May 1453 royal licence for John Neville's brother, Thomas Neville to marry Maud Stanhope being issued. News of this must have reached the north within the fortnight, for by the twelfth, one of the Earl of Northumberland's younger sons, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, began recruiting men. In August 1453, John Neville raided the Percy castle of Topcliffe, possibly with the intention of seizing Egremont. Failing to find him, Neville resorted to threatening the Percy tenantry who were in residence. He and Egremont were subsequently summoned to appear before the Royal Council, a summons which was ignored by both. Feuding continued through summer 1453, and even though they had been instructed to keep the peace, by the 27 July, the council was issuing letters to Northumberland and Salisbury regarding their sons. This was followed by more letters to the sons. In Knaresborough, the locals generally aligned themselves with John Neville due to the unpopularity of Sir William Plumpton (the king's man), from whom they began stealing with impunity, which resulted in severe injuries when the Neville brothers demonstrated a \\"show of force\\" in January 1454. John Neville was with his brother's wedding party when Egremont ambushed them on the return from Tattershall Castle. This took place on Heworth Moor on 24 August 1453. The next month, John took a raiding party and ransacked Egremont's Catton manor, \\"breaking windows and shattering tiles.\\" With his brothers, Thomas and Richard, as well as the Earl of Salisbury, they faced the Earl of Northumberland and his sons at Topcliffe on 20 October 1453, although a peace was then negotiated. The feud continued for much of the next year, and only came to a halt with a battle at Salisbury's manor of Stamford Bridge, near York on 31 October 1454. Thomas and John confronted, and decisively beat, Egremont and Richard Percy, whom the Nevilles captured.  Marriage  John Neville married Isabel Ingoldsthorpe (c.1441 ‚Äì 20 May 1476), of Burrough Green and Sawston, Cambridgeshire, on 25 April 1457; Archbishop Thomas Bourchier officiated the marriage at Canterbury Cathedral. Isabel was not only the heiress of her father, Sir Edmund Ingaldsthorpe (who had died on 2 September 1456), but also the heiress of her maternal uncle, John Tiptoft and his Earldom of Worcester. It may have been that Earl of Worcester had engineered the match. A letter to John Paston on 1 May 1457 described how \\"the Erle [of Warwick's] yonger bro√æere maryed to Ser Edmund Ynglthorp's doughter upon Seynt Markes Day; the Erle of Worcestre broght aboute the maryage.\\" She was a greater heiress than might have been expected for a youngest son like John. John was granted seven southern manors by his father and mother, the Earl and Countess of Salisbury, for his part. John Neville's marriage caused a dispute with Queen Margaret: even though Isabel was over fourteen years-old (and therefore of legal age), the Queen claimed that Isabel was still her ward. As a result, Queen Margaret insisted that John pay her a fine for his marriage to Isabel: he was bound to pay her ¬£1,000 in ten instalments.  Wars of the Roses  The king had become incapacitated in August 1453, which had led to the Duke of York being appointed protector and controlling the government. By Christmas of 1454, however, King Henry had recovered from his illness, which removed the basis for York's authority. Having reconvened the court at Westminster by mid-April 1455, Henry and a select council of nobles decided to hold a great council at Leicester. York and the Nevilles anticipated that Somerset would bring charges against them at this assembly. John Neville included, they gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at St Albans. The gate of Chester Castle; John and his brother were imprisoned here for a year. Although only a small affray, it resulted in the deaths of some important people; viz. the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford. It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke. Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the profits of York's redistribution of Skipwith's ex-offices. In December 1456, the new Duke of Somerset tried to attack John Neville in London's Cheapside; Somerset had already attempted something similar to John's brother Warwick the previous month. John's encounter, reported contemporary chroniclers, would have become a \\"skirmish\\" if the mayor had not intervened. As it had been John who had \\"spearheaded\\" the Neville retaliation to the Percies during their feud, Salisbury entered into a bond for Thomas and John's behaviour on 23 March 1458. John, however continued to receive commissions from the government. He was part of a delegation of twenty-two Ambassadors nominated to discuss breaches of the Truce with Burgundy on 14 May that year, and two months later he was investigating the murder of a royal serjeant. In 1459, he was appointed steward of the Honour of Pontefract. Reconciliation between the crown and the sons of the dead lords of St Albans on the one half and of York and his Neville allies did not last, however. In mid-September 1459, the Earl of Salisbury, intending to meet York at the latter's castle at Ludlow, marched south from Middleham Castle with his household, retainers, and a force of around five-thousand men. John and Thomas were with him. Salisbury's force was engaged by a much larger royal army under the command of Lord Audley on 23 September at Blore Heath, near Mucklestone, Staffordshire. Even though he had numerical superiority the result was defeat for Audley, who was killed. However at some point John Neville ‚Äì along with his brother Thomas and their father's retainer James Harrington were captured. This might have occurred in their pursuit of fleeing Lancastrians the next day or alternatively they may have been injured in battle and had been sent home. Either way, captured at Acton Bridge near Tarporley, Cheshire, the four were imprisoned in Chester Castle. John Neville was not released until July 1460. As a result, he was not present at the Yorkists' rout at the Battle of Ludford Bridge, which resulted in his father and brother's exile in Calais. He had still been attainted at the Parliament of Devils in October 1459 and only restored in August the next year. He was not released until June that year, and remained in London with during York's return from exile, and his claiming of the throne. On 1 November 1460, York appointed John the king's Chamberlain for a crown-wearing ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral. He stayed in London as word arrived that Lancastrians were gathering an army in the north; York, Salisbury, and John's brother Thomas marched north to confront them. On 30 December 1460 they went down to a crushing defeat outside York's castle at Sandal, at the Battle of Wakefield where York and Thomas were killed, and Salisbury captured and killed the next day. John Neville appears to have been Lieutenant of the castle of Calais, whilst Warwick served as its Captain. During the Protector's absence that winter, and after York's and Salisbury's death, alongside his brothers Warwick and George (the Chancellor) Neville was part of the head of government.  Elevation to the peerage and war in the north  According to Benet's Chronicle, John Neville was elevated to the peerage as Lord Montagu in the January 1461 parliament. It was also at this parliament that he presented a petition, regarding his wife, in which he reiterated that in common law women receive livery of their lands at fourteen years of age, and he requested parliament to reaffirm this. In February he was elected to the Order of the Garter. He was installed on 21 March 1462, when he took his father's choir stall in Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel. Map for Second Battle of St Albans by Ramsay. By February 1461 Queen Margaret's army was marching south. Warwick and John, with their \\"frantically raised\\" army, collected the King and marched north to confront the Queen's army on the Great North Road. The two armies met on 17 February at the Second Battle of St Albans ‚Äì this time, just outside the town. In the resulting encounter, Warwick was \\"outflanked and now outmatched,\\" whereas John seems to have kept his army together up until the point the King's person was regained by the Lancastrians. Montagu commanded the left flank of the Yorkist army, which itself was subdivided into a group of archers in the town itself, with the majority posted on Bernards Heath, stretching eastwards towards Warwick's vanguard. This \\"bloody and bitter encounter\\" saw Warwick and John's army defeated. The Earl escaped; Montagu was captured and sent to York Castle. It seems probable that he escaped execution after the battle because, as the Milanese Ambassador wrote, \\"a brother of my lord of Somerset is a prisoner [of Warwick's] at Calais.\\" Quartered arms of Sir John Neville, Lord Montagu, KG As a result of his capture and imprisonment in York, Montagu escaped participation in the biggest and probably bloodiest battle of the Wars of the Roses which took place on 29 March 1461 at Towton in Yorkshire. This decisive Yorkist victory led to Montagu being released the next day, when the son of the Duke of York ‚Äì and England's de facto new king ‚Äì Edward IV entered York in triumph. Montagu and Warwick then missed the King's coronation in April, as they stayed in the north to attempt the recapture of northern castles still in Lancastrian hands; as John Gillingham has put it, \\"the unfinished military business would have to be left to the Nevilles.\\" And on 10 May 1461 Montagu was commissioned to raise troops against both the Lancastrian remnants and the king of Scotland. One of Montagu's first actions was to successfully raise the siege of Carlisle, \\"with prompt action.\\" Carlisle had had its suburbs burnt and been under siege from June by a Scottish-Lancastrian force, but was easily relieved by him, apparently killing 6,000 Scots and Lord Clifford's brother in the process, before Warwick had even arrived. The military campaign that followed was focussed on the recapture of strategically vital castles on the Northumbrian border. Alnwick Castle was commanded by a shell keep, to which extra towers had been added, as well as to the curtain wall, with a solid barbican and gatehouse. Bamburgh Castle was on a high spur ridge with three baileys, a large keep, and fortified gateways. Dunstanburgh Castle stood on a dolerite spur which had the sheer drop of a cliff on one side. Montagu besieged Bamburgh, the most important of these northern bulwarks, due to its distance from London and proximity to Scotland. By 26 December 1462, when the garrison surrendered, they \\"had been reduced to eating their horses.\\" Montagu joined Warwick in escorting the chariot of six horses in the funeral cortege conveying the mortal remains of their father and brother from Pontefract Castle to the family mausoleum at Bisham Abbey, on 14‚Äì15 February 1463. On 6 May he was appointed Warden of the Eastern March; Warwick was his counterpart on the western marches. Later that year, he led an expedition to Norham Castle, which had been besieged by the Scots for the previous eighteen days, and relieved it on 26 July; this was followed by a Chevauch√©e into Scotland which only ceased when Montagu's force ran out of supplies. = Royal patronage = In the meantime though, John received the first royal patronage of the reign, being granted the royal gold and silver mines in Devon and Cornwall worth ¬£110 annually, for life. This was followed by duty payments from York and Kingston upon Hull and manors belonging to the dead Lancastrian Viscount Beaumont. In June 1461 he received the wardship of Edward Tiptoft, the heir of John Tiptoft, during his minority, and also the lands of Lord Clifford (who had died at Ferrybridge in a sharp encounter the night before Towton). Professor A. J. Pollard has noted, ironically, that Neville \\"had to earn his rewards.\\" In 1462 he was appointed Steward of the Household of the Palatinate of Durham, for which he received around ¬£40 a year. This was twice the salary his legally-trained and \\"non-noble\\" successors would receive from the Bishop in later years, and has been described as a \\"unique post.\\"  Hexham and Hedgeley Moor  The battle site of Hedgley Moor, where Montagu defeated a Lancastrian army in 1464. In spite of Montagu's and Warwick's northern successes in the years following Towton, a not-insubstantial Lancastrian army was still active in the area; it had been slowly been re- taking castles, like Bamburgh, Hexham, Langley, Norham, and Prudhoe Castles, between February and March 1464. This threatened Newcastle, a major Yorkist supply centre. Local Lancastrians were returning to their estates, such as the Cliffords, who regained their castle at Skipton Craven with no royal response, military or otherwise. They \\"virtually controlled most of the country immediately south of the Scottish border\\", wrote Charles Ross, although very few local gentry directly supported them. The situation was severe enough that in April 1464 he was too occupied with the northern situation to travel to London, and was exempted from attending the Order of the Garter Chapter meeting on the 29th of the month. He has been described as the king's 'resident commander' in the north and a \\"confident and aggressive commander.\\" In early 1464, the Lancastrians having coalesced in the East March, the ongoing peace negotiations with the Scots were moved from Newcastle to York. Montagu was sent to escort their embassy through now-unfriendly territory. On his way to pick them up at Norham, he only avoided an ambush near Newcastle, by a small force of eighty spear and bowmen under Sir Humphrey Neville, by changing his route. The Scottish embassy he eventually collected at Norham had been delayed, and it was on the return journey that the Duke of Somerset with Lords Roos and Hungerford, Sir Richard Turnstall, and Sir Thomas Findern and the bulk of the Lancastrian army (approximately 5,000 men) ambushed Montagu at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April 1464. The assault failed, and left Sir Ralph Percy dead on the field. Montagu, having delivered the Scottish embassy to Newcastle, left there on 14 May, either with Lords Greystoke and Willoughby or picking them up en route with other supporters, to seek out the Lancastrians. The next day, at Hexham ‚Äì having crossed the Tyne \\"either at Bulwell or Corbridge\\" ‚Äì he attacked the rebels in their camp which was on the south side of Devil's Water river. Montagu, his army swelled with new recruits from Newcastle, and men raised by Montagu's brother, the Archbishop of York, may have had up to 10,000 men. Leading his army \\"forward at the charge,\\" Montagu's attack soon became a rout, with the Lancastrian army dissolving and attempting escape over the bridge. Lords Roos, Hungerford, Findern, and Tallboys survived the battle only to be executed, on Montagu's order ‚Äì and probably in his presence ‚Äì with the Duke of Somerset in Newcastle. Following Hexham, Montagu ordered the largest number of beheadings the civil wars had yet seen. =Earl of Northumberland= In May 1464, Hexham, Langley and Bywell castles surrendered to Montagu. Eight days later, on 27 May, he was created Earl of Northumberland, while Henry Percy was imprisoned in the Tower. The Earldom gave an income of between ¬£700 and ¬£1,000 a year. This, wrote Cora L. Scofield, was his reward for his decisive victories, since the Crown \\"had played no direct part in them.\\" That summer Montagu recaptured the three Northumberland castles ‚Äì Dunstanburgh, Alnwick, and Bamburgh ‚Äì that had been previously lost. Later that year ‚Äì the \\"high watermark of his House, the zenith of the Nevilles\\" ‚Äì Montagu's brother George was appointed Archbishop of York, with John his Treasurer at his enthronement feast. During the feast, John's wife Isabel, sat at the children's table, supervising Warwick's two daughters and the young Duke of Gloucester.  Later years  Following the final crushing of the Lancastrian resistance, Montagu's role focussed on diplomacy and peace keeping. In June 1465 he was commissioned to contract marriages \\"between English and Scottish subjects\\" as well as to treat for a perpetual peace with Scotland, as a result of which, Montagu returned the captured Duke of Albany to Scotland, for which he was paid fifty marks. It was during this time (Hicks has suggested around January 1465) that Montagu and Lord Scales were requested by the Duke of Brittany to accompany a force of 3,000 Breton archers supplied by him, for the League of the Public Weal against Louis XI of France. However, due to commitments in the north with Warwick, Montagu ended up taking no part in this campaign. In 1465 Montagu received the main grant of the Percy Earldom of Northumberland estates, and on 25 March the following year he was granted the constableships and honours of Knaresborough and Pontefract Castles, which Warwick and before him their father had previously held, and also the castles of Tickhill, Snaith, and Dunstanburgh. This was to repay his arrears in back wages from his Wardenship of the East March, from an indenture of 1 June 1463. On the same day he was made Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster (north of the Trent), and it was from the profits of the duchy that his wages were coming from, amounting to approximately ¬£1,000. =Warden of the Marches= The Wardens were the military guardians of the border from the late fourteenth-century, and their salaries made them the highest-paid among Crown officers, but this was inclusive of the cost of raising troops and maintaining defence. This has also been described as controlling \\"private armies raised at the Crown's expense.\\" By the mid-fifteenth century, the Wardenship of the East March was the most important of the two northern marcher lordships. Marcher Wardens were granted the right to recruit by their being \\"explicitly\\" exempted from the 1468 Statute of Livery, which restrained- or attempted to restrain- retaining. Montagu, however, was allowed to continue retaining in times of peace as well as war. At this point Humphrey Neville was still on the run, and Montagu required troops to be raised on various occasions; in 1467, for example, Beverley sent him troops to deal with Humphrey's resistance. =Warwick's rebellion= In 1467, as part of his brother's plan for a closer relationship with the French, John and Isabelle accompanied Warwick in escorting the French King's envoys to Canterbury. However, by this time, it was being rumoured that Warwick was moving towards supporting the House of Lancaster, as a result of dissatisfaction over the king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and his pursuit of an anti-French foreign policy. In 1469, Warwick organised Robin of Redesdale's rebellion against Edward IV in Yorkshire and in July that year the king's brother George, Duke of Clarence married Warwick's daughter Isabelle whilst anchored off Calais; this was in direct defiance of the king's own wishes. It seems that Montagu, however, reacted strongly against his brother's machinations, and, unlike him, was satisfied with his current position. On 27 October 1469, Henry Percy had taken his oath of fealty to the King, and had been released from the Tower. The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick. Montagu was forced to come down from the Scottish border to suppress it; this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he \\"allowed the leaders to escape ... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again\\" at a more opportune moment. Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a Robin of Holderness, but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom. The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469. King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion, and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north back to London. However, it was while Edward was in York that he ordered the rehabilitation of Henry Percy to his family Earldom on 25/27 March 1470. On the same day John was elevated to the Marquessate of Montagu, and now outranked his brother, an Earl, in the English peerage. Historians have since questioned, however, whether his new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had had, and have even suggested that the king was \\"walking a tightrope\\" as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not. To compensate him for the loss of the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead Earl of Devon, and Montagu's son, George was created Duke of Bedford. These were substantial estates, providing an income of at least ¬£600 per annum. Montagu was to be the new regional magnate ‚Äì as he had been in the north ‚Äì to fill an existing power vacuum.  Rebellion and death  Montagu, though, was not happy with the new arrangements, and King Edward has been held responsible for turning Montagu from a friend to an enemy. Warkworth's Chronicle describes him as condemning these grants to him as \\"a [mag]pyes] nest.\\" Montagu had been on the Scottish border since at least January 1470. Following unrest in Lincolnshire and the subsequent Lincolnshire rebellion, the king marched from London to crush the rising. This he did at the Battle of Empingham. Following the battle, Edward headed north where he was met by Montagu and Northumberland at Doncaster. Warwick and Clarence's involvement in the Lincolnshire uprising had by now been established, and they fled to Calais. Further trouble broke out in the summer of 1470 in the north, with friends and relatives of Warwick in open rebellion. The new Earl of Northumberland was unable to put down these risings, so the king, once again marched north to deal with it personally. Modern historians generally consider that these rebellions were a deliberate trap, instigated by Warwick and Clarence from Calais. On 24 June 1470 the Wardenship of the East March was stripped from Montagu and given to Percy. Edward was still in the north with Percy when he received word that the Warwick and Clarence had landed in Dartmouth. At Doncaster, the king awaited Montagu, who was in the north raising a substantial force in Edward's name. Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king has been called \\"decisive\\". The king was trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to Bishop's Lynn, sailing for Burgundy on 2 October. =Readeption of Henry VI= On 3 October, with Edward IV in exile, Henry VI was released from the Tower and returned to the throne by Warwick. Almost immediately, Montagu was granted the wardship of the executed Earl of Worcester's heir and estates, as well as of the young Lord Clifford. He was reappointed to the Wardenship of the East March, with its salary, on 22 October 1470. However, Montagu did not profit from the new regime as he probably expected to. He did not regain the Earldom of Northumberland. Further, he lost some of the Courtney lands that had come with his Marquessate to the newly returned Earl of Devon. Montagu had no active role in government, and does not seem to have sat in Council, although he was appointed Chamberlain to the King's Household. Although he was confirmed in command of the new King's forces in the north and in possession of the manor of Wressle on 21 March 1471, he did not regain any other Percy estates. Indeed, it has been suggested that his loyalty might still have been suspect by the newly arrived Lancastrians: having been summoned to the November 1470 parliament, Polydor Virgil states that he had to apologise there for his prior support of Edward. Montagu even had to pay cash for the king's pardon, which he only received after making a lengthy speech, declaring that he had only remained faithful to Edward out of fear. Montagu, having responsibility for the defence of the north, received various commissions of array, which reflected the government's knowledge that King Edward was equipping a Burgundian-backed fleet in order to re-invade. Montagu was to raise men from all across the north. On 14 March 1471, King Edward landed at Ravenspur, on the coast of Yorkshire; he had intended to land in East Anglia, but this had been established as being unsafe. Montagu, it has been suggested, could have \\"snuffed out\\" Edward's army almost immediately had he moved fast enough. Montagu was in Pontefract Castle as Edward passed by (where even his castle bailiff deserted him for the returning king, taking the castle's funds with him). Montagu's army, composed of local militias, was probably in the region of several thousand men, between 6,000 and 7,000, and increased as he trailed Edward south. Montagu arrived at Coventry, where the Earl of Warwick was camped, in early April 1471; this was probably the day after Clarence had defected back to his brother Edward, and taken his army with him. =Battle of Barnet Heath= By 12 April 1471, Montagu, with his brother Warwick and the Duke of Exeter, the Earl of Oxford, and Viscount Beaumont were approaching London with their army. Battle of Barnet, as depicted on a 15th-century Ghent manuscript Edward, having arrived in London on 11 April and been reunited with his queen, met Montagu and Warwick a few miles north of London, outside the village of Barnet. It is possible that he commanded a smaller army, perhaps of only 9,000 men, and probably no more than 14,000. The battle on 14 April was a \\"confused affair\\" and fought in fog. It has been suggested that it was Montagu who persuaded Warwick to fight on foot at Barnet, leaving the horses tethered at the rear, in order to demonstrate their commitment to the cause by taking the same risks as the common soldier. Montagu probably controlled the centre battle of Warwick's army, facing Edward's own section, on the Great North Road from Barnet to St. Albans. Warkworth's Chronicle states that Warwick had an army of 20,000 men and that the battle beginning at 0400, lasted until ten o'clock that morning. Contemporaries have favourably described Montagu's martial skill at Barnet. Philippe de Commines called him as \\"a very courageous knight,\\" and the Burgundian observer Jean de Waurin wrote that, in the thick of the fighting, Montagu was \\"cutting off arms and heads like a hero of romance.\\" The Earl of Oxford, commanding the right wing of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, \\"disaster struck.\\" In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's \\"Streaming star\\" banner as the king's \\"Sunne in splendour,\\" and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York. Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a cognizance, and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog. At some point, possibly around this time, Montagu was killed; he was certainly dead before his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states this occurred \\"in plain battle,\\" and in the thick of the fighting, rather than in the rout that later followed. Aftermath The bodies of Warwick and Montagu were laid out \\"on the morrow after\\" and \\"openly shewed and naked\\" in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour starting that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses \\"to be put in a cart ... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days\\" before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory. Family With Isabelle Ingaldsthorpe, John Neville had a son and five daughters. The eldest was George Neville, Duke of Bedford (c. 1461‚Äì1483). It appears that Montagu had wanted to marry George to Anne, heiress of the Duke of Exeter; however, she had married the Earl of Dorset by 1466. George eventually died without issue, having been stripped of his dukedom in 1478. His first daughter was Anne, who married Sir William Stonor of Stonor in Pyrton, Oxfordshire, a grandson of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Elizabeth married firstly Thomas Scrope, 6th Baron Scrope of Masham, who was a dedicated Yorkist for his whole career, and secondly Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, while Margaret Neville married firstly Sir John Mortimer (who died before 12 November 1504), only son of Sir Hugh Mortimer and Eleanor Cornwall, secondly Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and thirdly Robert Downes, gentleman. Lucy married firstly Sir Thomas FitzWilliam of Aldwark, North Yorkshire, and secondly Sir Anthony Browne. Finally, Isabel, who married firstly Sir Thomas Huddleston of Millom, Cumberland (the Huddlestons of Millom were an important regional family and old allies of the Nevilles), and secondly Sir William Smythe of Elford in Staffordshire. Neville's widow remarried, on 25 April 1472, as his second wife, Sir William Norreys of Yattendon. =Arms= Montagu took for his crest \\"a griffin issuing from a ducal crown\\". His coat of arms was the Neville \\"Gules a saltire argent\\" with a label \\"gobony argent and azure crescent\\" for differencing, as a younger son. This coat, when he was made Marquis of Montagu, was later augmented with further quarterings.

Those who study spiders and other arachnids are arachnologists. More narrowly, the study of spiders alone (order Araneae) is known as araneology.https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/araneology The word \\"arachnology\\" derives from Greek , arachnƒì, \\"spider\\"; and , -logia. Arachnology as a science Arachnologists are primarily responsible for classifying arachnids and studying aspects of their biology. In the popular imagination, they are sometimes referred to as spider experts. Disciplines within arachnology include naming species and determining their evolutionary relationships to one another (taxonomy and systematics), studying how they interact with other members of their species and/or their environment (behavioural ecology), or how they are distributed in different regions and habitats (faunistics). Other arachnologists perform research on the anatomy or physiology of arachnids, including the venom of spiders and scorpions. Others study the impact of spiders in agricultural ecosystems and whether they can be used as biological control agents. =Subdisciplines= Arachnology can be broken down into several specialties. These topics include: * acarology ‚Äì the study of ticks and mites * araneology ‚Äì the study of spiders * scorpiology ‚Äì the study of scorpions Arachnological societies Arachnologists are served by a number of scientific societies, both national and international in scope. Their main roles are to encourage the exchange of ideas between researchers, to organise meetings and congresses, and in a number of cases, to publish academic journals. Some are also involved in science outreach programs, such as the European spider of the year, which raise awareness of these animals among the general public.

It is the conjugate base of hydrazoic acid (HN3). N is a linear anion that is isoelectronic with CO2, NCO‚àí, N2O, NO and NCF. Per valence bond theory, azide can be described by several resonance structures; an important one being ^-N=\\\\overset{+}N=N^-. Azide is also a functional group in organic chemistry, RN3. The dominant application of azides is as a propellant in air bags. Preparation =Inorganic azides= Sodium azide is made industrially by the reaction of nitrous oxide, N2O with sodium amide in liquid ammonia as solvent: :N2O + 2 NaNH2 -> NaN3 \\\\+ NaOH + NH3 Many inorganic azides can be prepared directly or indirectly from sodium azide. For example, lead azide, used in detonators, may be prepared from the metathesis reaction between lead nitrate and sodium azide. An alternative route is direct reaction of the metal with silver azide dissolved in liquid ammonia. Some azides are produced by treating the carbonate salts with hydrazoic acid. Azide is a common ligand in coordination chemistry. The structure of [Co(en)2(SO3)N3] . =Organic azides= The principal source of the azide moiety is sodium azide. As a pseudohalogen compound, sodium azide generally displaces an appropriate leaving group (e.g., Br, I, OTs) to give the azido compound. Aryl azides may be prepared by displacement of the appropriate diazonium salt with sodium azide, or trimethylsilyl azide; nucleophilic aromatic substitution is also possible, even with chlorides. Anilines and aromatic hydrazines undergo diazotization, as do alkyl amines and hydrazines. Appropriately functionalized aliphatic compounds undergo nucleophilic substitution with sodium azide. Aliphatic alcohols give azides via a variant of the Mitsunobu reaction, with the use of hydrazoic acid. Hydrazines may also form azides by reaction with sodium nitrite: : PhNHNH2 \\\\+ NaNO2 ‚Üí PhN3 Alkyl or aryl acyl chlorides react with sodium azide in aqueous solution to give acyl azides, which give isocyanates in the Curtius rearrangement. :300px The azo-transfer compounds, trifluoromethanesulfonyl azide and imidazole-1-sulfonyl azide, are prepared from sodium azide as well. They react with amines to give the corresponding azides: :RNH2 ‚Üí RN3 Dutt‚ÄìWormall reaction A classic method for the synthesis of azides is the Dutt‚ÄìWormall reaction in which a diazonium salt reacts with a sulfonamide first to a diazoaminosulfinate and then on hydrolysis the azide and a sulfinic acid.Name Reactions: A Collection of Detailed Reaction Mechanisms by Jie Jack Li Published 2003 Springer :512x512px Reactions =Inorganic azides= Azide salts can decompose with release of nitrogen gas. The decomposition temperatures of the alkali metal azides are: NaN3 (275 ¬∞C), KN3 (355 ¬∞C), RbN3 (395 ¬∞C), and CsN3 (390 ¬∞C). This method is used to produce ultrapure alkali metals.E. D√∂nges \\"Alkali Metals\\" in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Edited by G. Brauer, Academic Press, 1963, NY. Vol. 1. p. 475. Protonation of azide salts gives toxic hydrazoic acid in the presence of strong acids: :H+ \\\\+ N ‚Üí HN3 Azide salts may react with heavy metals or heavy metal compounds to give the corresponding azides, which are more shock sensitive than sodium azide alone. They decompose with sodium nitrite when acidified. This is a method of destroying residual azides, prior to disposal. : 2 NaN3 \\\\+ 2 HNO2 ‚Üí 3 N2 \\\\+ 2 NO + 2 NaOH Many inorganic covalent azides (e.g., chlorine, bromine, and iodine azides) have been described. The azide anion behaves as a nucleophile; it undergoes nucleophilic substitution for both aliphatic and aromatic systems. It reacts with epoxides, causing a ring- opening; it undergoes Michael-like conjugate addition to 1,4-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Azides can be used as precursors of the metal nitrido complexes by being induced to release N2, generating a metal complex in unusual oxidation states (see high-valent iron). =Organic azides= Organic azides engage in useful organic reactions. The terminal nitrogen is mildly nucleophilic. Azides easily extrude diatomic nitrogen, a tendency that is exploited in many reactions such as the Staudinger ligation or the Curtius rearrangement or for example in the synthesis of Œ≥-imino-Œ≤-enamino esters.Reaction conditions: a) sodium azide 4 eq., acetone, 18 hours reflux 92% chemical yield b) isopropyl amine, titanium tetrachloride, diethyl ether 14 hr reflux 83% yield. Azide 2 is formed in a nucleophilic aliphatic substitution reaction displacing chlorine in 1 by the azide anion. The ketone reacts with the amine to an imine which tautomerizes to the enamine in 4. In the next rearrangement reaction nitrogen is expulsed and a proton transferred to 6. The last step is another tautomerization with the formation of the enamine 7 as a mixture of cis and trans isomers :700px Azides may be reduced to amines by hydrogenolysishttps://www.organic- chemistry.org/synthesis/N1H/reductionsazides.shtm or with a phosphine (e.g., triphenylphosphine) in the Staudinger reaction. This reaction allows azides to serve as protected -NH2 synthons, as illustrated by the synthesis of 1,1,1-tris(aminomethyl)ethane: :3 H2 \\\\+ CH3C(CH2N3)3 ‚Üí CH3C(CH2NH2)3 \\\\+ 3 N2 In the azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition, organic azides react as 1,3-dipoles, reacting with alkynes to give substituted 1,2,3-triazoles.

Some organic azides are potential rocket propellants, an example being 2-dimethylaminoethylazide (DMAZ). =Other= Because of the hazards associated with their use, few azides are used commercially although they exhibit interesting reactivity for researchers. Low molecular weight azides are considered especially hazardous and are avoided. In the research laboratory, azides are precursors to amines. They are also popular for their participation in the \\"click reaction\\" and in Staudinger ligation. These two reactions are generally quite reliable, lending themselves to combinatorial chemistry. The antiviral drug zidovudine (AZT) contains an azido group. Some azides are valuable as bioorthogonal chemical reporters. Safety * Azides are explosophores and toxins. * Sodium azide is toxic ( oral (rat) = 27 mg/kg) and can be absorbed through the skin. It decomposes explosively upon heating to above 275 ¬∞C and reacts vigorously with CS2, bromine, nitric acid, dimethyl sulfate, and a series of heavy metals, including copper and lead. In reaction with water or Br√∏nsted acids the highly toxic explosive hydrogen azide is released. * Heavy metal azides, such as lead azide are primary high explosives detonable when heated or shaken. Heavy-metal azides are formed when solutions of sodium azide or HN3 vapors come into contact with heavy metals or their salts. Heavy-metal azides can accumulate under certain circumstances, for example, in metal pipelines and on the metal components of diverse equipment (rotary evaporators, freezedrying equipment, cooling traps, water baths, waste pipes), and thus lead to violent explosions. * Some organic and other covalent azides are classified as highly explosive and toxic: inorganic azides as neurotoxins; azide ions as cytochrome c oxidase inhibitors. * It has been reported that sodium azide and polymer-bound azide reagents react with dichloromethane and bromoform to form di- and triazidomethane resp., which are both unstable in high concentrations in solution. Various devastating explosions were reported while reaction mixtures were being concentrated on a rotary evaporator.

The Government of Northern Ireland was granted arms (the Coat of arms of Northern Ireland) by Royal Warrant and had the right to display these arms on a flag or banner. This right was exercised for the Coronation in 1953 when the banner was flown for the first time over Parliament Buildings in honour of the Queen's visit. Also during the Queen's visit, on July 1, 1953, the Minister for Home Affairs announced that, while the Union flag was the only standard officially recognised, those who wished to have a distinctive Ulster symbol might use the banner.McCartney, Clem & Bryson, Lucy. Clashing Symbols? A report on the use of flags, anthems and other national symbols in Northern Ireland. The Institute for Irish Studies, Queen's University of Belfast, 1994, p. 42 When the Parliament of Northern Ireland was dissolved by the British government under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, the flag ceased to be used by a body with a royal warrant but remains the only flag which represents Northern Ireland at international level in sport. Since the Northern Ireland government and parliament were abolished in 1972, use of the Ulster Banner among loyalists has increased. Official use of flags There are various practices for the flying of flags by public bodies in Northern Ireland. The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) Order 2000 requires that the Union Flag be flown over specified government buildings including Parliament Buildings and state offices on specified 'named days' (honouring, for example Queen Elizabeth II's official birthday). The regulations also provide that, on the occasion of a visit to a government building by the British Monarch, the Royal Standard shall be flown and the Union Flag can be flown, and on state visits from other heads of state the Union Flag and the national flag of the country of the visitor can be flown. Where two flagpoles exist, the flag of Europe should be flown on Europe Day alongside the Union flag. The regulations prohibit any flags being flown from the relevant buildings except as expressly permitted by the regulations. When flags representing the \\"Home Countries\\" of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are flown at official ceremonies, Northern Ireland is sometimes represented by the St. Patrick's Cross, for instance on the barge Gloriana during the 2012 Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant. In May 2016 the Ulster Banner was flown from horseback during the Musical Ride of the Household Cavalry at The Queen's 90th Birthday Celebration at Windsor, alongside the flags of England, Scotland and Wales.The Queen's 90th Birthday Celebration, Souvenir Programme, Regal Press Ltd, 2016, p. 12, Other regulations exist for other public bodies in Northern Ireland. Use of flags by the Police Service of Northern Ireland is governed by the Police Emblems and Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002, which provides that no flag shall be used by the Service other than its own flag. =Local authorities= Legislation relating to flag flying does not apply to District Council buildings, and District Councils follow a range of practices varying from flying the Union Flag on a number of council buildings every day of the year as at Lisburn, to flying no flags on any building, flying only the council flag or flying flags on the designated days in the same way as government buildings.Transforming Conflict: Flags and Emblems by Dominic Bryan and Gordon Gillespie, Institute of Irish Studies, Queen's University, Belfast, March 2005 In 2004, Belfast City Council commissioned a study on the flying of the Union Flag which noted that the Ulster Banner was flown alongside it by three unionist-controlled district councils at that time: Ards Borough Council, Carrickfergus Borough Council and Castlereagh Borough Council.Belfast City Council (May 2004), Flying of the Union Flag: An Equality Impact Assessment. These councils have since been replaced. Displaying flags In Northern Ireland, some members from each of the unionist and nationalist communities use flags to declare their political allegiances and to mark territory.Dominic Bryan & Gordon Gillespie (2005) Transforming Conflict: Flags and Emblems, Belfast: Institute of Irish Studies, Queens University Belfast Unionists and loyalists fly the Union Flag and Ulster Banner to show their support for the union and/or their allegiance to Northern Ireland. Irish nationalists and republicans fly the Irish tricolour to show their support for a United Ireland.The National Flag, Department of the Taoiseach Support for a united Ireland is shown in the Irish tricolor with the white stripe in the center symbolizing a hope for future peace, specifically peace with the Republic of Ireland. After the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, flags continue to be a source of disagreement in Northern Ireland. The Agreement states that: Nationalists pointed to this to argue that the use of the Union Flag for official purposes should be restricted, or that the Irish tricolour should be flown alongside the British flag on government buildings. Sinn F√©in ministers in the power- sharing Northern Ireland Executive instructed that the Union Flag was not to fly from buildings operated by their respective departments. This power was removed from ministers by virtue of the Flag Regulations (Northern Ireland) Order 2000, mentioned above. All signatories to the Belfast Agreement also declare their acceptance of the 'principle of consent' (i.e. that there will be no change to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland unless a majority votes for it), and Unionists argued that this provision amounts to recognising that the Union Flag is the only legitimate official flag in Northern Ireland. The problem was discussed in detail and various proposals made including suggestions for a new flag.Flagging concern: the controversy over flags and emblems In 2013, US diplomat Richard Haass chaired talks between the political parties in Northern Ireland dealing with, among other things, the issue of flags. The resulting draft proposals, which were not agreed by the parties, included the idea of a new flag for Northern Ireland, to replace the Ulster banner. International sport The Ulster Banner was carried by the Northern Ireland team in the Commonwealth Games. It is also regularly displayed by supporters of the Northern Ireland national football team and is displayed by FIFA as the flag of Northern Ireland.

However, Westlaw discontinued free printing for law students effective June 30, 2013. The United States district court imposed various requirements regarding the companies' operations in a consent decree resulting from an antitrust inquiry by the United States Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act in connection with Thomson's purchase of West Publishing, and West's and Lexis's settlement of various outstanding claims in that proceeding.Final Judgment: U.S. v.

However, Wolters has not yet unified its online and offline legal offerings under a single brand (although it has gathered its existing brands under the umbrella of \\"Wolters Kluwer Law and Business\\").

The noble gases often do not react with many substances and were historically referred to as the inert gases. Inert gases are used generally to avoid unwanted chemical reactions degrading a sample. These undesirable chemical reactions are often oxidation and hydrolysis reactions with the oxygen and moisture in air. The term inert gas is context-dependent because several of the noble gases can be made to react under certain conditions. Purified argon and nitrogen gases are most commonly used as inert gases due to their high natural abundance (78.3% N2, 1% Ar in air) and low relative cost. Unlike noble gases, an inert gas is not necessarily elemental and is often a compound gas. Like the noble gases, the tendency for non- reactivity is due to the valence, the outermost electron shell, being complete in all the inert gases.Singh, Jasvinder. The Sterling Dictionary of Physics. New Delhi, India: Sterling, 2007. 122. This is a tendency, not a rule, as noble gases and other \\"inert\\" gases can react to form compounds. The group 18 elements include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon. They are referred to as noble gases or inert gases. The general configuration of the valence shell is ns2np6. All of these elements occur in a free state in the atmosphere. They are colourless , tasteless and odorless gases. They exhibit low melting and boiling points. They have high positive electron gain enthalpy and high ionization enthalpy. Production The inert gases are obtained by fractional distillation of air, with the exception of helium which is separated from a few natural gas sources rich in this element, through cryogenic distillation or membrane separation. For specialized applications, purified inert gas shall be produced by specialized generators on-site. They are often used by chemical tankers and product carriers (smaller not a big as well as the tendency of inert gases vesselshtop specialized generators are also available for laboratories. Applications Because of the non-reactive properties of inert gases they are often useful to prevent undesirable chemical reactions from taking place. Food is packed in inert gas to remove oxygen gas. This prevents bacteria from growing.Maier, Clive & Teresa Calafut. Polypropylene: The Definitive User's Guide and Databook. Norwich, New York: Plastics Design Library, 1998. 105. It also prevents chemical oxidation by oxygen in normal air. An example is the rancidification (caused by oxidation) of edible oils. In food packaging, inert gases are used as a passive preservative, in contrast to active preservatives like sodium benzoate (an antimicrobial) or BHT (an antioxidant). Historical documents may also be stored under an inert gas to avoid degradation. For example, the original documents of the U.S. Constitution are stored under humidified argon. Helium was previously used, but it was less suitable because it diffuses out of the case more quickly than argon. Inert gases are often used in the chemical industry. In a chemical manufacturing plant, reactions can be conducted under inert gas to minimize fire hazards or unwanted reactions. In such plants and in oil refineries, transfer lines and vessels can be purged with inert gas as a fire and explosion prevention measure. At the bench scale, chemists perform experiments on air-sensitive compounds using air-free techniques developed to handle them under inert gas. Helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon are inert gases. =Inert gas systems on ships= Inert gas is produced on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes)(from Jan 1, 2016) by using either a flue gas system or by burning kerosene in a dedicated inert gas generator. The inert gas system is used to prevent the atmosphere in cargo tanks or bunkers from coming into the explosive range.International Maritime Organization. Tanker yes Familiarization London: Ashford Overload Services, 2000. 185. Inert gases keep the oxygen content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude carriers, less for product carriers and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite. Inert gases are most important during discharging and during the ballast voyage when more hydrocarbon vapor is likely to be present in the tank atmosphere. Inert gas can also be used to purge the tank of the volatile atmosphere in preparation for gas freeing - replacing the atmosphere with breathable air - or vice versa. The flue gas system uses the boiler exhaust as its source, so it is important that the fuel/air ratio in the boiler burners is properly regulated to ensure that high quality inert gases are produced. Too much air would result in an oxygen content exceeding 5%, and too much fuel oil would result in carryover of dangerous hydrocarbon gas. The flue gas is cleaned and cooled by the scrubber tower. Various safety devices prevent overpressure, the return of hydrocarbon gas to the engine room, or having a supply of IG with too high oxygen content. Gas tankers and product carriers cannot rely on flue gas systems (because they require IG with O2 content of 1% or less) and so use inert gas generators instead. The inert gas generator consists of a combustion chamber and scrubber unit supplied by fans and a refrigeration unit which cools the gas. A drier in series with the system removes moisture from the gas before it is supplied to the deck. Cargo tanks on gas carriers are not inerted, but the whole space around them is. This arrangement allows the tanks to be kept cool using a small heel of cargo while the vessel is in ballast while retaining the explosion protection provided by the inert gas. =Inert gas systems on aircraft= Inert gas is produced on board commercial and military aircraft in order to passivate fuel tanks. On hot days, fuel vapor in fuel tanks may otherwise form a flammable or explosive mixture which if oxidized, could have catastrophic consequences. Conventionally, Air Separation Modules (ASMs) have been used to generate inert gas. ASMs contain selectively permeable membranes. They are fed compressed air which drives the separation of oxygen from the air. For fuel tank passivation, it is not necessary to remove all oxygen, but rather enough to stay below the lean flammability limit and the lean explosion limit. =Welding= In gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), inert gases are used to shield the tungsten from contamination. It also shields the fluid metal (created from the arc) from the reactive gases in air which can cause porosity in the solidified weld puddle. Inert gases are also used in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) for welding non- ferrous metals.Davis, J.R., ed. Corrosion: Understanding the Basics. Materials Park, Ohio: ASM International, 2000. 188. Some gases which are not usually considered inert but which behave like inert gases in all the circumstances likely to be encountered in some use can often be used as a substitute for an inert gas. This is useful when an appropriate pseudo-inert gas can be found which is inexpensive and common. For example, carbon dioxide is sometimes used in gas mixtures for GMAW because it is not reactive to the weld pool created by arc welding. But it is reactive to the arc. The more carbon dioxide that is added to the inert gas, such as argon, will increase your penetration. The amount of carbon dioxide is often determined by what kind of transfer you will be using in GMAW. The most common is spray arc transfer, and the most commonly used gas mixture for spray arc transfer is 90% argon and 10% carbon dioxide. (Listed as many different names depending on the gas supplier). =Diving= In underwater diving an inert gas is a component of the breathing mixture which is not metabolically active, and serves to dilute the gas mixture. The inert gas may have effects on the diver, but these are thought to be mostly physical effects, such as tissue damage caused by bubbles in decompression sickness. The most common inert gases used in breathing gas for commercial diving are nitrogen and helium.

Britannica.com. (also sometimes Titus Petronius Niger ; c. 27 ‚Äì 66 AD) was a Roman courtier during the reign of Nero. He is generally believed to be the author of the Satyricon, a satirical novel believed to have been written during the Neronian era (54‚Äì68 AD). Life Tacitus, Plutarch and Pliny the Elder describe Petronius as the elegantiae arbiter (also phrased arbiter elegantiarum), \\"judge of elegance\\", in the court of the emperor Nero. He served as suffect consul in 62.Paul Gallivan, \\"Some Comments on the Fasti for the Reign of Nero\\", Classical Quarterly, 24 (1974), p. 302 Later, he became a member of the senatorial class who devoted themselves to a life of pleasure. His relationship to Nero was apparently akin to that of a fashion advisor. Tacitus gives this account of Petronius in his historical work the Annals (XVI.18): None of the ancient sources give any further detail about his life, or mention that he was a writer. However, a medieval manuscript written around 1450 of the Satyricon credited a \\"Titus Petronius\\" as the author of the original work. Traditionally, this reference is linked with Petronius Arbiter, since the novel appears to have been written or at least set during his lifetime. The link, however, remains speculative and disputed. =As a writer= Petronius' development of his characters in the Satyricon, namely Trimalchio, transcends the traditional style of writing of ancient literature. In the literature written during Petronius' lifetime, the emphasis was always on the typical considerations of plot, which had been laid down by classical rules. The character, which was hardly known in ancient literature, was secondary. Petronius goes beyond these literary limitations in his exact portrayals of detailed speech, behaviour, surroundings, and appearance of the characters. Another literary device Petronius employs in his novel is a collection of specific allusions. The allusions to certain people and events are evidence that the Satyricon was written during Nero's time. These also suggest that it was aimed at a contemporary audience which consisted in part of Nero's courtiers and even Nero himself. One such allusion, found in chapter 9, refers to the story of the good wife Lucretia which was well known at the time: The message Petronius tries to convey in his work is far from moral and does not intend to produce reform, but is written above all to entertain and should be considered artistically. Nevertheless, his writings can be a valuable tool to better comprehend the customs and ways of life of Roman society at that particular time, since the author strives to preserve the plausibility of his representation, as can be noted by the frequent use of allusions and detailed descriptions of characters and behaviours. As the title implies, the Satyricon is a satire, specifically a Menippean satire, in which Petronius satirizes nearly anything, using his taste as the only standard. It is speculated that Petronius' depiction of Trimalchio mirrors that of Nero. Although the author's own opinion is never alluded to, the opinions of the characters involved in the story are evident, as is how Encolpius criticizes Trimalchio. =Death= Petronius' high position soon made him the object of envy for those around him. Having attracted the jealousy of Tigellinus, the commander of the emperor's guard, he was accused of treason. He was arrested at Cumae in 65 AD but did not wait for a sentence. Instead, he chose to take his own life. Tacitus again records his elegant suicide in the sixteenth book of the Annals: According to Pliny the Elder: \\"T. Petronius, a consular, when he was going to die through Nero's jealousy and envy, broke his fluorspar wine-dipper so that the emperor's table would not inherit it. It had cost 300,000 sesterces\\". T. Petronius and G. Petronius have been said to have been the same man. Apocryphal quotation In recent times, a popular quotation, actually written by Charlton Ogburn in 1957, on reorganization is often spuriously attributed to a Gaius Petronius. In one version it reads: > We trained hard ... but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form > up into teams we would be reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we > tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it > can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, > inefficiency, and demoralization.

Retrieved 25 March 2011 \\"BBC\\" Background Operation Telic was one of the largest deployments of British forces since World War II. It was only approached in size by the 1991 Operation Granby deployment for the Gulf War and the 1956 Operation Musketeer Suez Crisis deployment. It was considerably larger than the 1982 Operation Corporate in the Falklands War, which saw around 30,000 personnel deployed and the Korean War, which saw fewer than 20,000 personnel deployed. Some 9,500 of the British servicemen and women who deployed on Operation Telic for the invasion and its aftermath were reservists, from the Territorial Army and from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment. Notice that additional British forces were deploying to the region (large numbers of RAF personnel were already deployed in Kuwait, Turkey and elsewhere in the region on Operations Northern Watch and Southern Watch) was given in three separate Commons statements by Geoff Hoon Secretary of State for Defence. On 7 January, the deployment of naval forces and Royal Marines was announced. 20 January saw the land forces deployment announced and 6 February the air forces. They were ready in time for hostilities to start on 19 March. When compared with the deployment of forces prior to the Gulf War things proceeded a great deal faster, with the slowest deploying elements taking 10 weeks to get from base to combat readiness in the theatre. The deployment used 64 British and foreign flagged merchant vessels. Telic means a purposeful or defined action (from Greek œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÇ, telos). Unlike the United States who called their equivalent military deployment Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Ministry of Defence uses a computer to generate its names so that they carry no overtly political connotations. The meaning was initially unknown but as initial planning took place over the Christmas 2002 period, the term became jokingly known amongst personnel as a backronym for Tell Everyone Leave Is Cancelled. Command structure The force was commanded by a three- star tri-service headquarters. The commander of the operation was Air Marshal Brian Burridge, with Major General Peter Wall acting as his Chief of Staff. The headquarters was situated at CENTCOM headquarters in Qatar. The three services each had two-star commanders leading operations. The Royal Navy commander was Rear Admiral David Snelson who had his headquarters ashore in Bahrain. The afloat Royal Navy commander was Commodore Jamie Miller, who had the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal as his flagship. The British 1st Armoured Division was commanded by Major General Robin Brims. Three army brigades were assigned to the division. 16 Air Assault Brigade was commanded by Brigadier 'Jacko' Page, 7 Armoured Brigade by Brigadier Graham Binns and 102 Logistics Brigade by Brigadier Shaun Cowlam. The Royal Marines 3 Commando Brigade was also under the operational command of the division and was commanded by Brigadier (now Lieutenant General Sir) Jim Dutton. The Royal Air Force commander was Air-Vice Marshal Glenn Torpy. Major General Wall took over command of 1st Armoured Division on 1 May 2003. He was replaced as Chief of Staff by Major General Barney White-Spunner. Rear Admiral Snelson was succeeded by Major General Tony Milton, Commandant General Royal Marines as maritime forces commander on 16 April 2003. Post-invasion Occupation zones of Iraq after the invasion. On 11 July 2003, 1st Armoured Division handed control over south-east Iraq to 3rd Mechanised Division, Major General Wall was succeeded by Major General Graeme Lamb as commander of British ground forces in Iraq. Unlike the invasion period, by then there was a substantial presence from many nations other than America, Britain, Australia and Poland. In addition to British troops, 3rd Division now commanded Italian, Dutch, Danish, Czech, Lithuanian, Norwegian and New Zealand forces. 3rd Division handed over a new composite divisional headquarters on 28 December 2003. Major General Andrew Stewart took over from General Lamb as commander of British forces. After the end of major operations, the main components of the British forces changed greatly. 3 Commando Brigade was withdrawn in early May and 16 Air Assault Brigade left later in the same month apart from a couple of infantry battalions. 7 Armoured Brigade remained until relieved by 19 Mechanised Brigade at the same time as 3rd Division took over from 1st Division. 102 Logistics Brigade was relieved by 101 Logistic Brigade in late May. Most of the RAF aircraft left the area with a few retained for patrols over Iraq and support of ground forces. British naval forces also returned to more usual levels, with two surface combatants, a tanker and a repair ship present in early July. A further rotation of ground troops occurred in November 2003, with 19 Mechanised Brigade relieved by 20th Armoured Brigade; 20th Armoured Brigade in its turn being relieved by 1 Mechanised Brigade. In April 2004, 20th Armoured Brigade turned over its responsibilities to 1 Mechanised Brigade and Lieutenant General John McColl was appointed deputy commander of occupation ground forces. By July 2004 the British area saw its fifth commander when Major General Bill Rollo took over. At the end of 2004 General Rollo was succeeded by Major General Jonathan Riley and in November of that year 4 Armoured Brigade rotated to replace 1 Mechanised Brigade. In May 2005, 4 Armoured Brigade was replaced by 12 Mechanised Brigade with the handover of responsibility taking place on 30 May. In May 2006 7th Armoured Brigade, the Desert Rats were relieved by 20th Armoured Brigade under the command of Brigadier James Everard. October 2006 saw 19 Light Brigade take over from 20th Armoured Brigade.MOD Defence News 06/11/2006 - 20 Brigade welcomed home from Iraq 1 Mechanised Brigade provided HQ and troops for Op TELIC 10, deploying to Iraq in June 2007. During that tour, both the PJCC and Basra Palace were handed back to Iraqi control. They handed over to 4th Mechanised Brigade on 1 December 2007. Equipment For full details about the UK's contribution, please see the Operation Telic order of battle The conflict saw over 100 fixed-wing aircraft and over 100 rotary-wing aircraft of virtually every type in the British inventory deployed. It also saw a 33 ship fleet, which was the largest taskforce deployed by the UK since the Falklands War. Some 120 Challenger 2 main battle tanks, 150 Warrior infantry fighting vehicles, 32 AS-90 self-propelled 155 mm howitzers and 36 105 mm towed howitzers were deployed with the land forces, with reconnaissance vehicles and everything else that makes a modern mechanised and armoured force function. During the post invasion phase, and following a number of British casualties blamed on inadequate equipment, a great deal of new equipment was purchased to help deal with the threats posed by insurgents. These included 166 armoured Pinzgauer Vectors PPV, 108 Mastiff PPV, 145 enhanced FV430 MkIII \\"Bulldogs\\", Desert Hawk UAV and 8 Britten-Norman Defender ISTAR aircraft. Casualties A total of 179 MOD 21/11/07 - Operations In Iraq: British Fatalities British Armed Forces personnel died serving on Operation Telic between the start of the campaign in March 2003 and the end of operations in July 2009; 136 in hostile incidents and the remaining 43 under non-hostile circumstances. Full non-fatal casualty records are currently only available for the period after 1 January 2006. From that date, 3,598 British personnel were wounded, injured or fell ill (315 wounded in action); 1,971 of whom required aeromedical evacuation.http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/CE1302FF-C47C-4F83-B616-2FF9645A2FB2/0/OpTelicCasualtyTables.pdf However, these totals are likely to rise significantly as and when full records for 2003 to 2006 become available. By 11 March 2007, more than 2,100 soldiers had returned from Iraq suffering from some form of mental illness, including PTSD. In fiction The British television film The Mark of Cain depicted service of a fictional British Army unit, the 1st Battalion Northdale Rifles in Operation Telic, just after the end of combat operations and in the first stages of the occupation. A stage production based on the Scottish Black Watch Regiment was also created, drawing on experiences of veterans of the war. It was played out to much acclaim throughout Scotland in 2006.

The branched asphodel is known to contain colchicine, a chemical used in the treatment of gout. Physical characteristics The Asphodelus ramosus is a geophyte, having an underground storage organ which enables the plant to survive adverse conditions, such as excessive heat and drought. Its leaves, growing to a height of ‚Äì, contain alkaloids that are harmful to sheep and goats in the wet, winter months, but during the summer when their leaves dry out, they lose their toxicity.Avi Shmida, MAPA's Dictionary of Plants and Flowers in Israel, Tel-Aviv 2005, s.v.

Strabo and Stephanus call him the \\"earnest-jester\\" (, spoudogeloios). His writings exercised considerable influence upon later literature, and the Menippean satire genre is named after him. Although the writings of Menippus no longer survive, there are some fragments of Varro's Saturae Menippeae, which were written in imitation of Menippus.Cicero, Academica, i. 2, 8; Aulus Gellius, ii. 18; Macrobius, Sat. i. 11 One of the dialogues attributed to Lucian, his avowed imitator, who frequently mentions him, is called Menippus, but since the sub-title (\\"The Oracle of the Dead\\") resembles that of a work ascribed to Menippus by Diogenes La√´rtius, it has been suggested that it is imitated from his Necromancy. Diogenes La√´rtius says the following works were written by Menippus:Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 101 * ŒùŒ≠Œ∫œÖŒπŒ± ‚Äì Necromancy * ŒîŒπŒ±Œ∏·øÜŒ∫Œ±Œπ ‚Äì Wills * ·ºòœÄŒπœÉœÑŒøŒªŒ±·Ω∂ Œ∫ŒµŒ∫ŒøŒºœàŒµœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ±Œπ ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œ∏Œµ·ø∂ŒΩ œÄœÅŒøœÉœéœÄŒøœÖ ‚Äì Letters artificially composed as if by the Gods * Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ œÜœÖœÉŒπŒ∫Œø·Ω∫œÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œø·Ω∫œÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ≥œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œø·Ω∫œÇ ‚Äì Replies to the Natural Philosophers, and Mathematicians, and Grammarians * ŒìŒøŒΩ·Ω∞œÇ ·ºòœÄŒπŒ∫ŒøœçœÅŒøœÖ ‚Äì The Birth of Epicurus * Œ§·Ω∞œÇ Œ∏œÅŒ∑œÉŒ∫ŒµœÖŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ±œÇ ·ΩëœÄ' Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œµ·º∞Œ∫Œ¨Œ¥Œ±œÇ ‚Äì The School's reverence of the twentieth day (celebrated in the Epicurean school) In addition, Athenaeus mentions works called SymposiumAthenaeus, 14.629F and Arcesilaus,Athenaeus, 14.664E and Diogenes La√´rtius mentions a Sale of Diogenes ()Diogenes La√´rtius, vi. 29. written by Menippus which seems to be the main source of the story that Diogenes of Sinope was captured by pirates and sold into slavery.

This model typically applies when charge carriers have been emitted from some region of a solid‚Äîthe cloud of emitted carriers can form a space charge region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules left behind in the solid can form a space charge region. Space charge only occurs in dielectric media (including vacuum) because in a conductive medium the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or screened. The sign of the space charge can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a metal object when it is heated to incandescence in a vacuum. This effect was first observed by Thomas Edison in light bulb filaments, where it is sometimes called the Edison effect. Space charge is a significant phenomenon in many vacuum and solid-state electronic devices. Cause =Physical explanation= When a metal object is placed in a vacuum and is heated to incandescence, the energy is sufficient to cause electrons to \\"boil\\" away from the surface atoms and surround the metal object in a cloud of free electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The resulting cloud is negatively charged, and can be attracted to any nearby positively charged object, thus producing an electric current which passes through the vacuum. Space charge can result from a range of phenomena, but the most important are: # Combination of the current density and spatially inhomogeneous resistance # Ionization of species within the dielectric to form heterocharge # Charge injection from electrodes and from a stress enhancement # Polarization in structures such as water trees. \\"Water tree\\" is a name given to a tree-like figure appearing in a water-impregnated polymer insulating cable. It has been suggested that in alternating current (AC) most carriers injected at electrodes during a half of cycle are ejected during the next half cycle, so the net balance of charge on a cycle is practically zero. However, a small fraction of the carriers can be trapped at levels deep enough to retain them when the field is inverted. The amount of charge in AC should increase slower than in direct current (DC) and become observable after longer periods of time.  Hetero and homo charge  Hetero charge means that the polarity of the space charge is opposite to that of neighboring electrode, and homo charge is the reverse situation. Under high voltage application, a hetero charge near the electrode is expected to reduce the breakdown voltage, whereas a homo charge will increase it. After polarity reversal under ac conditions, the homo charge is converted to hetero space charge. =Mathematical explanation= If the \\"vacuum\\" has a pressure of 10‚àí6 mmHg or less, the main vehicle of conduction is electrons. The emission current density (J) from the cathode, as a function of its thermodynamic temperature T, in the absence of space-charge, is given by Richardson's law: :J = (1-\\\\tilde{r})A_0T^2\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-\\\\phi}{kT}\\\\right) where :A_0 = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi e m_e k^2}{h^3} \\\\approx 1.2 \\\\times 10^6 A m‚àí2 K‚àí2 : = elementary positive charge (i.e., magnitude of electron charge), : = electron mass, : = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38 x 10‚àí23J/K, : = Planck's constant = 6.62 x 10‚àí34 J s, : = work function of the cathode, : = mean electron reflection coefficient. The reflection coefficient can be as low as 0.105 but is usually near 0.5. For tungsten, (1 - ≈ô)A0 = 0.6 to 1.0 √ó 106 A m‚àí2 K‚àí2, and œÜ = 4.52 eV. At 2500 ¬∞C, the emission is 28207 A/m2. The emission current as given above is many times greater than that normally collected by the electrodes, except in some pulsed valves such as the cavity magnetron. Most of the electrons emitted by the cathode are driven back to it by the repulsion of the cloud of electrons in its neighborhood. This is called the space charge effect. In the limit of large current densities, J is given by the Child‚ÄìLangmuir equation below, rather than by the thermionic emission equation above. Occurrence Space charge is an inherent property of all vacuum tubes. This has at times made life harder or easier for electrical engineers who used tubes in their designs. For example, space charge significantly limited the practical application of triode amplifiers which led to further innovations such as the vacuum tube tetrode. On the other hand, space charge was useful in some tube applications because it generates a negative EMF within the tube's envelope, which could be used to create a negative bias on the tube's grid. Grid bias could also be achieved by using an applied grid voltage in addition to the control voltage. This could improve the engineer's control and fidelity of amplification. It allowed to construct space charge tubes for car radios that required only 6 or 12 volts anode voltage (typical examples were the 6DR8/EBF83, 6GM8/ECC86, 6DS8/ECH83, 6ES6/EF97 and 6ET6/EF98). Space charges can also occur within dielectrics. For example, when gas near a high voltage electrode begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, electrical charges are injected into the region near the electrode, forming space charge regions in the surrounding gas. Space charges can also occur within solid or liquid dielectrics that are stressed by high electric fields. Trapped space charges within solid dielectrics are often a contributing factor leading to dielectric failure within high voltage power cables and capacitors.  Space-charge- limited current  = In vacuum (Child's law) = thumb First proposed by Clement D. Child in 1911, Child's law states that the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) in a plane-parallel vacuum diode varies directly as the three- halves power of the anode voltage Va and inversely as the square of the distance d separating the cathode and the anode. For electrons, the current density J (amperes per meter squared) is written: :J = \\\\frac{ I_a }{ S } =\\\\frac{4 \\\\epsilon_0}{9}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2e}{m_e}} \\\\frac{V_a^{3/2}}{d^2}. where Ia is the anode current and S the surface area of the anode receiving the current; e is the magnitude of the charge of the electron and m_e is its mass. The equation is also known as the \\"three-halves-power law\\" or the Child‚ÄìLangmuir law. Child originally derived this equation for the case of atomic ions, which have much smaller ratios of their charge to their mass. Irving Langmuir published the application to electron currents in 1913, and extended it to the case of cylindrical cathodes and anodes. The equation's validity is subject to the following assumptions: # Electrons travel ballistically between electrodes (i.e., no scattering). # In the interelectrode region, the space charge of any ions is negligible. # The electrons have zero velocity at the cathode surface. The assumption of no scattering (ballistic transport) is what makes the predictions of Child‚ÄìLangmuir law different from those of Mott‚ÄìGurney law. The latter assumes steady-state drift transport and therefore strong scattering. = In semiconductors = In semiconductors and insulating materials, an electric field causes charged particles, electrons, to reach a specific drift velocity that is parallel to the direction of the field. This is different from the behavior of the free charged particles in a vacuum, in which a field accelerates the particle. The proportionality factor between the magnitudes of the drift velocity, v, and the electric field, \\\\mathcal E, is called the mobility, \\\\mu: :v = \\\\mu \\\\mathcal{E}  Drift regime (Mott‚ÄìGurney law)  The Child's law behavior of a space-charge-limited current that applies in a vacuum diode doesn't generally apply to a semiconductor/insulator in a single- carrier device, and is replaced by the Mott‚ÄìGurney law. For a thin slab of material of thickness L, sandwiched between two selective Ohmic contacts, the electric current density, J, flowing through the slab is given by: :J=\\\\frac{9}{8} {\\\\epsilon}{\\\\mu} \\\\frac{{V_a}^{2}}{{L}^3} , where V_a is the voltage that has been applied across the slab and \\\\epsilon is the permitivity of the solid. The Mott‚ÄìGurney law offers some crucial insight into charge- transport across an intrinsic semiconductor, namely that one should not expect the drift current to increase linearly with the applied voltage, i.e., from Ohm's law, as one would expect from charge-transport across a metal or highly doped semiconductor. Since the only unknown quantity in the Mott‚ÄìGurney law is the charge-carrier mobility, \\\\mu, the equation is commonly used to characterize charge transport in intrinsic semiconductors. Using the Mott‚ÄìGurney law for characterizing amorphous semiconductors, along with semiconductors containing defects and/or non-Ohmic contacts, should however be approached with caution as significant deviations both in the magnitude of the current and the power law dependence with respect to the voltage will be observed. In those cases the Mott‚ÄìGurney law can not be readily used for characterization, and other equations which can account for defects and/or non-ideal injection should be used instead. During the derivation of the Mott‚ÄìGurney law, one has to make the following assumptions: # There is only one type of charge carrier present, i.e., only electrons or holes. # The material has no intrinsic conductivity, but charges are injected into it from one electrode and captured by the other. # The carrier mobility, \\\\mu, and the permittivity, \\\\epsilon, are constant throughout the sample. # The current flow is not limited by traps or energetic disorder. # The current is not predominantly due to doping. # The electric field at the charge-injecting electrode is zero, meaning that the current is governed by drift only. As an application example, the steady-state space-charge-limited current across a piece of intrinsic silicon with a charge-carrier mobility of 1500 cm2/V-s, a dielectric constant of 11.9, an area of 10‚àí8 cm2 and a thickness of 10‚àí4 cm can be calculated by an online calculator to be 126.4 ŒºA at 3 V. Note that in order for this calculation to be accurate, one must assume all the points listed above. In the case where the electron/hole transport is limited by trap states in the form of exponential tails extending from the conduction/valence band edges, :n_\\\\mathrm{t}=\\\\frac{N_\\\\mathrm{t}}{k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_\\\\mathrm{c}}\\\\exp \\\\left( - \\\\frac{E}{k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_\\\\mathrm{c}} \\\\right), the drift current density is given by the Mark-Helfrich equation, :J= q^{1-l}{\\\\mu}{N_\\\\mathrm{eff}} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_\\\\mathrm{r} \\\\epsilon_0 l}{N_\\\\mathrm{t}(l+1)}\\\\right)^l \\\\left( \\\\frac{2l+1}{l+1} \\\\right)^{l+1} \\\\frac{{V_a}^{l+1}}{{L}^{2l+1}} where q is the elementary charge, l=k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_\\\\mathrm{c}/k_\\\\mathrm{B}T with k_\\\\mathrm{B}T being the thermal energy, N_\\\\mathrm{eff} is the effective density of states of the charge carrier type in the semiconductor, i.e., either E_\\\\mathrm{C} or E_\\\\mathrm{V}, and N_\\\\mathrm{t} is the trap density.  Low voltage regime  In the case where a very small applied bias is applied across the single-carrier device, the current is given by: :J=4{\\\\pi}^2 \\\\frac{k_\\\\mathrm{B}T}{q} {\\\\mu}{\\\\epsilon} \\\\frac{{L}^3}. Note that the equation describing the current in the low voltage regime follows the same thickness scaling as the Mott‚ÄìGurney law, L^{-3}, but increases linearly with the applied voltage. Saturation regimes When a very large voltage is applied across the semiconductor, the current can transition into a saturation regime. In the velocity-saturation regime, this equation takes the following form :J=2{\\\\epsilon}{v}\\\\frac{{L}^2} Note the different dependence of J on V_a between the Mott‚ÄìGurney law and the equation describing the current in the velocity-saturation regime. In the ballistic case (assuming no collisions), the Mott‚ÄìGurney equation takes the form of the more familiar Child‚ÄìLangmuir law. In the charge-carrier saturation regime, the current through the sample is given by, :J={q}{\\\\mu}{N_\\\\mathrm{eff}}\\\\frac where N_\\\\mathrm{eff} is the effective density of states of the charge carrier type in the semiconductor.  Shot noise  Space charge tends to reduce shot noise. Shot noise results from the random arrivals of discrete charge; the statistical variation in the arrivals produces shot noise. A space charge develops a potential that slows the carriers down. For example, an electron approaching a cloud of other electrons will slow down due to the repulsive force. The slowing carriers also increases the space charge density and resulting potential. In addition, the potential developed by the space charge can reduce the number of carriers emitted. When the space charge limits the current, the random arrivals of the carriers are smoothed out; the reduced variation results in less shot noise.

The hypothesis was formulated by the chemist James Lovelock and co-developed by the microbiologist Lynn Margulis in the 1970s. Lovelock named the idea after Gaia, the primordial goddess who personified the Earth in Greek mythology. In 2006, the Geological Society of London awarded Lovelock the Wollaston Medal in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis. Topics related to the hypothesis include how the biosphere and the evolution of organisms affect the stability of global temperature, salinity of seawater, atmospheric oxygen levels, the maintenance of a hydrosphere of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the habitability of Earth. The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being teleological and against the principles of natural selection, but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as Earth system science, biogeochemistry and systems ecology.Gribbin, John (1990), \\"Hothouse earth: The greenhouse effect and Gaia\\" (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) Lovelock also once described the \\"geophysiology\\" of the Earth.Lovelock, James, (1995) \\"The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth\\" (W.W.Norton & Co) Even so, the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism, and today many scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by, or at odds with, the available evidence. Overview Gaian hypotheses suggest that organisms co-evolve with their environment: that is, they \\"influence their abiotic environment, and that environment in turn influences the biota by Darwinian process\\". Lovelock (1995) gave evidence of this in his second book, showing the evolution from the world of the early thermo-acido- philic and methanogenic bacteria towards the oxygen-enriched atmosphere today that supports more complex life. A reduced version of the hypothesis has been called \\"influential Gaia\\" in \\"Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?\\" by Andrei G. Lapenis, which states the biota influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. temperature and atmosphere. This is not the work of an individual but a collective of Russian scientific research that was combined into this peer reviewed publication. It states the coevolution of life and the environment through ‚Äúmicro-forces‚Äù and biogeochemical processes. An example is how the activity of photosynthetic bacteria during Precambrian times completely modified the Earth atmosphere to turn it aerobic, and thus supports the evolution of life (in particular eukaryotic life). Since barriers existed throughout the twentieth century between Russia and the rest of the world, it is only relatively recently that the early Russian scientists who introduced concepts overlapping the Gaia hypothesis have become better known to the Western scientific community. These scientists include Piotr Alekseevich Kropotkin (1842‚Äì1921) (although he spent much of his professional life outside Russia), Vasil‚Äôevich Rizpolozhensky (1847‚Äì1918), Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky (1863‚Äì1945), and Vladimir Alexandrovich Kostitzin (1886‚Äì1963). Biologists and Earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected emergent property or entelechy of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions may have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes reference examples of events that resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one at the end of the Archaean and the beginning of the Proterozoic periods. Less accepted versions of the hypothesis claim that changes in the biosphere are brought about through the coordination of living organisms and maintain those conditions through homeostasis. In some versions of Gaia philosophy, all lifeforms are considered part of one single living planetary being called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the coevolving diversity of living organisms. The Gaia hypothesis was an influence on the deep ecology movement.David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground, SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32. Details The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth is a self-regulating complex system involving the biosphere, the atmosphere, the hydrospheres and the pedosphere, tightly coupled as an evolving system. The hypothesis contends that this system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.Lovelock, James. The Vanishing Face of Gaia. Basic Books, 2009, p. 255. Gaia evolves through a cybernetic feedback system operated unconsciously by the biota, leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability in a full homeostasis. Many processes in the Earth's surface essential for the conditions of life depend on the interaction of living forms, especially microorganisms, with inorganic elements. These processes establish a global control system that regulates Earth's surface temperature, atmosphere composition and ocean salinity, powered by the global thermodynamic disequilibrium state of the Earth system.Kleidon, Axel. How does the earth system generate and maintain thermodynamic disequilibrium and what does it imply for the future of the planet?. Article submitted to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society on Thu, 10 Mar 2011 The existence of a planetary homeostasis influenced by living forms had been observed previously in the field of biogeochemistry, and it is being investigated also in other fields like Earth system science. The originality of the Gaia hypothesis relies on the assessment that such homeostatic balance is actively pursued with the goal of keeping the optimal conditions for life, even when terrestrial or external events menace them.Lovelock, James. The Vanishing Face of Gaia. Basic Books, 2009, p. 179. =Regulation of global surface temperature= Rob Rohde's palaeotemperature graphs Since life started on Earth, the energy provided by the Sun has increased by 25% to 30%; however, the surface temperature of the planet has remained within the levels of habitability, reaching quite regular low and high margins. Lovelock has also hypothesised that methanogens produced elevated levels of methane in the early atmosphere, giving a view similar to that found in petrochemical smog, similar in some respects to the atmosphere on Titan. This, he suggests tended to screen out ultraviolet until the formation of the ozone screen, maintaining a degree of homeostasis. However, the Snowball EarthHoffman, P.F. 2001. Snowball Earth theory research has suggested that \\"oxygen shocks\\" and reduced methane levels led, during the Huronian, Sturtian and Marinoan/Varanger Ice Ages, to a world that very nearly became a solid \\"snowball\\". These epochs are evidence against the ability of the pre Phanerozoic biosphere to fully self-regulate. Processing of the greenhouse gas CO2, explained below, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the Earth temperature within the limits of habitability. The CLAW hypothesis, inspired by the Gaia hypothesis, proposes a feedback loop that operates between ocean ecosystems and the Earth's climate. The hypothesis specifically proposes that particular phytoplankton that produce dimethyl sulfide are responsive to variations in climate forcing, and that these responses lead to a negative feedback loop that acts to stabilise the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. Currently the increase in human population and the environmental impact of their activities, such as the multiplication of greenhouse gases may cause negative feedbacks in the environment to become positive feedback. Lovelock has stated that this could bring an extremely accelerated global warming,Lovelock, James. The Vanishing Face of Gaia. Basic Books, 2009, but he has since stated the effects will likely occur more slowly.Lovelock J., NBC News. Link Published 23 April 2012, accessed 22 August 2012. Daisyworld simulations Plots from a standard black and white Daisyworld simulation In response to the criticism that the Gaia hypothesis seemingly required unrealistic group selection and cooperation between organisms, James Lovelock and Andrew Watson developed a mathematical model, Daisyworld, in which ecological competition underpinned planetary temperature regulation. Daisyworld examines the energy budget of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies, which are assumed to occupy a significant portion of the surface. The colour of the daisies influences the albedo of the planet such that black daisies absorb more light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect more light and cool the planet. The black daisies are assumed to grow and reproduce best at a lower temperature, while the white daisies are assumed to thrive best at a higher temperature. As the temperature rises closer to the value the white daisies like, the white daisies outreproduce the black daisies, leading to a larger percentage of white surface, and more sunlight is reflected, reducing the heat input and eventually cooling the planet. Conversely, as the temperature falls, the black daisies outreproduce the white daisies, absorbing more sunlight and warming the planet. The temperature will thus converge to the value at which the reproductive rates of the plants are equal. Lovelock and Watson showed that, over a limited range of conditions, this negative feedback due to competition can stabilize the planet's temperature at a value which supports life, if the energy output of the Sun changes, while a planet without life would show wide temperature swings. The percentage of white and black daisies will continually change to keep the temperature at the value at which the plants' reproductive rates are equal, allowing both life forms to thrive. It has been suggested that the results were predictable because Lovelock and Watson selected examples that produced the responses they desired. =Regulation of oceanic salinity= Ocean salinity has been constant at about 3.5% for a very long time. Salinity stability in oceanic environments is important as most cells require a rather constant salinity and do not generally tolerate values above 5%. The constant ocean salinity was a long- standing mystery, because no process counterbalancing the salt influx from rivers was known. Recently it was suggested that salinity may also be strongly influenced by seawater circulation through hot basaltic rocks, and emerging as hot water vents on mid-ocean ridges. However, the composition of seawater is far from equilibrium, and it is difficult to explain this fact without the influence of organic processes. One suggested explanation lies in the formation of salt plains throughout Earth's history. It is hypothesized that these are created by bacterial colonies that fix ions and heavy metals during their life processes. In the biogeochemical processes of Earth, sources and sinks are the movement of elements. The composition of salt ions within our oceans and seas is: sodium (Na+), chlorine (Cl‚àí), sulfate (SO42‚àí), magnesium (Mg2+), calcium (Ca2+) and potassium (K+). The elements that comprise salinity do not readily change and are a conservative property of seawater. There are many mechanisms that change salinity from a particulate form to a dissolved form and back. The known sources of sodium i.e. salts are when weathering, erosion, and dissolution of rocks are transported into rivers and deposited into the oceans. The Mediterranean Sea as being Gaia's kidney is found (here) by Kenneth J. Hsue, a correspondence author in 2001. The \\"desiccation\\" of the Mediterranean is the evidence of a functioning kidney. Earlier \\"kidney functions\\" were performed during the \\"deposition of the Cretaceous (South Atlantic), Jurassic (Gulf of Mexico), Permo-Triassic (Europe), Devonian (Canada), Cambrian/Precambrian (Gondwana) saline giants.\\" =Regulation of oxygen in the atmosphere= Vostok, Antarctica research station. Current period is at the left. The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth's atmospheric composition is kept at a dynamically steady state by the presence of life.Lovelock, James. The Vanishing Face of Gaia. Basic Books, 2009, p. 163. The atmospheric composition provides the conditions that contemporary life has adapted to. All the atmospheric gases other than noble gases present in the atmosphere are either made by organisms or processed by them. The stability of the atmosphere in Earth is not a consequence of chemical equilibrium. Oxygen is a reactive compound, and should eventually combine with gases and minerals of the Earth's atmosphere and crust. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event. Since the start of the Cambrian period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume. Traces of methane (at an amount of 100,000 tonnes produced per year) should not exist, as methane is combustible in an oxygen atmosphere. Dry air in the atmosphere of Earth contains roughly (by volume) 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.039% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases including methane. Lovelock originally speculated that concentrations of oxygen above about 25% would increase the frequency of wildfires and conflagration of forests. Recent work on the findings of fire- caused charcoal in Carboniferous and Cretaceous coal measures, in geologic periods when O2 did exceed 25%, has supported Lovelock's contention. =Processing of CO2= Gaia scientists see the participation of living organisms in the carbon cycle as one of the complex processes that maintain conditions suitable for life. The only significant natural source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is volcanic activity, while the only significant removal is through the precipitation of carbonate rocks. Carbon precipitation, solution and fixation are influenced by the bacteria and plant roots in soils, where they improve gaseous circulation, or in coral reefs, where calcium carbonate is deposited as a solid on the sea floor. Calcium carbonate is used by living organisms to manufacture carbonaceous tests and shells. Once dead, the living organisms' shells fall to the bottom of the oceans where they generate deposits of chalk and limestone. One of these organisms is Emiliania huxleyi, an abundant coccolithophore algae which also has a role in the formation of clouds. CO2 excess is compensated by an increase of coccolithophoride life, increasing the amount of CO2 locked in the ocean floor. Coccolithophorides increase the cloud cover, hence control the surface temperature, help cool the whole planet and favor precipitations necessary for terrestrial plants. Lately the atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased and there is some evidence that concentrations of ocean algal blooms are also increasing. Lichen and other organisms accelerate the weathering of rocks in the surface, while the decomposition of rocks also happens faster in the soil, thanks to the activity of roots, fungi, bacteria and subterranean animals. The flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the soil is therefore regulated with the help of living beings. When CO2 levels rise in the atmosphere the temperature increases and plants grow. This growth brings higher consumption of CO2 by the plants, who process it into the soil, removing it from the atmosphere. History =Precedents= Earthrise taken from Apollo 8 on December 24, 1968 The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The mythical Gaia was the primal Greek goddess personifying the Earth, the Greek version of \\"Mother Nature\\" (from Ge = Earth, and Aia = PIE grandmother), or the Earth Mother. James Lovelock gave this name to his hypothesis after a suggestion from the novelist William Golding, who was living in the same village as Lovelock at the time (Bowerchalke, Wiltshire, UK). Golding's advice was based on Gea, an alternative spelling for the name of the Greek goddess, which is used as prefix in geology, geophysics and geochemistry. Golding later made reference to Gaia in his Nobel prize acceptance speech. In the eighteenth century, as geology consolidated as a modern science, James Hutton maintained that geological and biological processes are interlinked. Later, the naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt recognized the coevolution of living organisms, climate, and Earth's crust. In the twentieth century, Vladimir Vernadsky formulated a theory of Earth's development that is now one of the foundations of ecology. Vernadsky was a Ukrainian geochemist and was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planet as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was a pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.S.R. Weart, 2003, The Discovery of Global Warming, Cambridge, Harvard Press His visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West, and some decades later the Gaia hypothesis received the same type of initial resistance from the scientific community. Also in the turn to the 20th century Aldo Leopold, pioneer in the development of modern environmental ethics and in the movement for wilderness conservation, suggested a living Earth in his biocentric or holistic ethics regarding land. Another influence for the Gaia hypothesis and the environmental movement in general came as a side effect of the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. During the 1960s, the first humans in space could see how the Earth looked as a whole. The photograph Earthrise taken by astronaut William Anders in 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission became, through the Overview Effect an early symbol for the global ecology movement.100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist =Formulation of the hypothesis= James Lovelock, 2005 Lovelock started defining the idea of a self-regulating Earth controlled by the community of living organisms in September 1965, while working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California on methods of detecting life on Mars. The first paper to mention it was Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other Changes Associated with the Presence of Life, co-authored with C.E. Giffin. A main concept was that life could be detected in a planetary scale by the chemical composition of the atmosphere. According to the data gathered by the Pic du Midi observatory, planets like Mars or Venus had atmospheres in chemical equilibrium. This difference with the Earth atmosphere was considered to be a proof that there was no life in these planets. Lovelock formulated the Gaia Hypothesis in journal articles in 1972 and 1974, followed by a popularizing 1979 book Gaia: A new look at life on Earth. An article in the New Scientist of February 6, 1975,Lovelock, John and Sidney Epton, (February 8, 1975). \\"The quest for Gaia\\". New Scientist, p. 304. and a popular book length version of the hypothesis, published in 1979 as The Quest for Gaia, began to attract scientific and critical attention. Lovelock called it first the Earth feedback hypothesis, and it was a way to explain the fact that combinations of chemicals including oxygen and methane persist in stable concentrations in the atmosphere of the Earth. Lovelock suggested detecting such combinations in other planets' atmospheres as a relatively reliable and cheap way to detect life. Lynn Margulis Later, other relationships such as sea creatures producing sulfur and iodine in approximately the same quantities as required by land creatures emerged and helped bolster the hypothesis. In 1971 microbiologist Dr. Lynn Margulis joined Lovelock in the effort of fleshing out the initial hypothesis into scientifically proven concepts, contributing her knowledge about how microbes affect the atmosphere and the different layers in the surface of the planet. The American biologist had also awakened criticism from the scientific community with her advocacy of the theory on the origin of eukaryotic organelles and her contributions to the endosymbiotic theory, nowadays accepted. Margulis dedicated the last of eight chapters in her book, The Symbiotic Planet, to Gaia. However, she objected to the widespread personification of Gaia and stressed that Gaia is \\"not an organism\\", but \\"an emergent property of interaction among organisms\\". She defined Gaia as \\"the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the Earth's surface. Period\\". The book's most memorable \\"slogan\\" was actually quipped by a student of Margulis': \\"Gaia is just symbiosis as seen from space\\". James Lovelock called his first proposal the Gaia hypothesis but has also used the term Gaia theory. Lovelock states that the initial formulation was based on observation, but still lacked a scientific explanation. The Gaia hypothesis has since been supported by a number of scientific experiments and provided a number of useful predictions. In fact, wider research proved the original hypothesis wrong, in the sense that it is not life alone but the whole Earth system that does the regulating. =First Gaia conference= In 1985, the first public symposium on the Gaia hypothesis, Is The Earth A Living Organism? was held at University of Massachusetts Amherst, August 1‚Äì6. The principal sponsor was the National Audubon Society. Speakers included James Lovelock, George Wald, Mary Catherine Bateson, Lewis Thomas, John Todd, Donald Michael, Christopher Bird, Thomas Berry, David Abram, Michael Cohen, and William Fields. Some 500 people attended.Bunyard, Peter (1996), \\"Gaia in Action: Science of the Living Earth\\" (Floris Books) =Second Gaia conference= In 1988, climatologist Stephen Schneider organised a conference of the American Geophysical Union. The first Chapman Conference on Gaia, was held in San Diego, California on March 7, 1988. During the \\"philosophical foundations\\" session of the conference, David Abram spoke on the influence of metaphor in science, and of the Gaia hypothesis as offering a new and potentially game-changing metaphorics, while James Kirchner criticised the Gaia hypothesis for its imprecision. Kirchner claimed that Lovelock and Margulis had not presented one Gaia hypothesis, but four - * CoEvolutionary Gaia: that life and the environment had evolved in a coupled way. Kirchner claimed that this was already accepted scientifically and was not new. * Homeostatic Gaia: that life maintained the stability of the natural environment, and that this stability enabled life to continue to exist. * Geophysical Gaia: that the Gaia hypothesis generated interest in geophysical cycles and therefore led to interesting new research in terrestrial geophysical dynamics. * Optimising Gaia: that Gaia shaped the planet in a way that made it an optimal environment for life as a whole. Kirchner claimed that this was not testable and therefore was not scientific. Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner recognised two alternatives. \\"Weak Gaia\\" asserted that life tends to make the environment stable for the flourishing of all life. \\"Strong Gaia\\" according to Kirchner, asserted that life tends to make the environment stable, to enable the flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific. Lovelock and other Gaia- supporting scientists, however, did attempt to disprove the claim that the hypothesis is not scientific because it is impossible to test it by controlled experiment. For example, against the charge that Gaia was teleological, Lovelock and Andrew Watson offered the Daisyworld Model (and its modifications, above) as evidence against most of these criticisms. Lovelock said that the Daisyworld model \\"demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways\\". Lovelock was careful to present a version of the Gaia hypothesis that had no claim that Gaia intentionally or consciously maintained the complex balance in her environment that life needed to survive. It would appear that the claim that Gaia acts \\"intentionally\\" was a metaphoric statement in his popular initial book and was not meant to be taken literally. This new statement of the Gaia hypothesis was more acceptable to the scientific community. Most accusations of teleologism ceased, following this conference. =Third Gaia conference= By the time of the 2nd Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis, held at Valencia, Spain, on 23 June 2000, the situation had changed significantly. Rather than a discussion of the Gaian teleological views, or \\"types\\" of Gaia hypotheses, the focus was upon the specific mechanisms by which basic short term homeostasis was maintained within a framework of significant evolutionary long term structural change. The major questions were: # \\"How has the global biogeochemical/climate system called Gaia changed in time? What is its history? Can Gaia maintain stability of the system at one time scale but still undergo vectorial change at longer time scales? How can the geologic record be used to examine these questions?\\" # \\"What is the structure of Gaia? Are the feedbacks sufficiently strong to influence the evolution of climate? Are there parts of the system determined pragmatically by whatever disciplinary study is being undertaken at any given time or are there a set of parts that should be taken as most true for understanding Gaia as containing evolving organisms over time? What are the feedbacks among these different parts of the Gaian system, and what does the near closure of matter mean for the structure of Gaia as a global ecosystem and for the productivity of life?\\" # \\"How do models of Gaian processes and phenomena relate to reality and how do they help address and understand Gaia? How do results from Daisyworld transfer to the real world? What are the main candidates for \\"daisies\\"? Does it matter for Gaia theory whether we find daisies or not? How should we be searching for daisies, and should we intensify the search? How can Gaian mechanisms be investigated using process models or global models of the climate system that include the biota and allow for chemical cycling?\\" In 1997, Tyler Volk argued that a Gaian system is almost inevitably produced as a result of an evolution towards far-from- equilibrium homeostatic states that maximise entropy production, and Kleidon (2004) agreed stating: \\"...homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo\\"; \\"...the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis\\". Staley (2002) has similarly proposed \\"...an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles... In [this] new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics, not Darwinian selection. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions\\". =Fourth Gaia conference= A fourth international conference on the Gaia hypothesis, sponsored by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and others, was held in October 2006 at the Arlington, VA campus of George Mason University. Martin Ogle, Chief Naturalist, for NVRPA, and long-time Gaia hypothesis proponent, organized the event. Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts- Amherst, and long-time advocate of the Gaia hypothesis, was a keynote speaker. Among many other speakers: Tyler Volk, Co-director of the Program in Earth and Environmental Science at New York University; Dr. Donald Aitken, Principal of Donald Aitken Associates; Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, President of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; Robert Correll, Senior Fellow, Atmospheric Policy Program, American Meteorological Society and noted environmental ethicist, J. Baird Callicott. This conference approached the Gaia hypothesis as both science and metaphor as a means of understanding how we might begin addressing 21st century issues such as climate change and ongoing environmental destruction. Criticism After initially receiving little attention from scientists (from 1969 until 1977), thereafter for a period the initial Gaia hypothesis was criticized by a number of scientists, such as Ford Doolittle, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould.Turney, Jon. \\"Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life\\" (Revolutions in Science) Lovelock has said that because his hypothesis is named after a Greek goddess, and championed by many non-scientists, the Gaia hypothesis was interpreted as a neo-Pagan religion. Many scientists in particular also criticised the approach taken in his popular book Gaia, a New Look at Life on Earth for being teleological‚Äîa belief that things are purposeful and aimed towards a goal. Responding to this critique in 1990, Lovelock stated, \\"Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the biota\\". Stephen Jay Gould criticised Gaia as being \\"a metaphor, not a mechanism.\\" He wanted to know the actual mechanisms by which self-regulating homeostasis was achieved. In his defense of Gaia, David Abram argues that Gould overlooked the fact that \\"mechanism\\", itself, is a metaphor ‚Äî albeit an exceedingly common and often unrecognized metaphor ‚Äî one which leads us to consider natural and living systems as though they were machines organized and built from outside (rather than as autopoietic or self- organizing phenomena). Mechanical metaphors, according to Abram, lead us to overlook the active or agential quality of living entities, while the organismic metaphorics of the Gaia hypothesis accentuate the active agency of both the biota and the biosphere as a whole.Abram, D. (1988) \\"The Mechanical and the Organic: On the Impact of Metaphor in Science\\" in Scientists on Gaia, edited by Stephen Schneider and Penelope Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1991 With regard to causality in Gaia, Lovelock argues that no single mechanism is responsible, that the connections between the various known mechanisms may never be known, that this is accepted in other fields of biology and ecology as a matter of course, and that specific hostility is reserved for his own hypothesis for other reasons.Lovelock, James (2001), Homage to Gaia: The Life of an Independent Scientist (Oxford University Press) Aside from clarifying his language and understanding of what is meant by a life form, Lovelock himself ascribes most of the criticism to a lack of understanding of non-linear mathematics by his critics, and a linearizing form of greedy reductionism in which all events have to be immediately ascribed to specific causes before the fact. He also states that most of his critics are biologists but that his hypothesis includes experiments in fields outside biology, and that some self-regulating phenomena may not be mathematically explainable. =Natural selection and evolution= Lovelock has suggested that global biological feedback mechanisms could evolve by natural selection, stating that organisms that improve their environment for their survival do better than those that damage their environment. However, in the early 1980s, W. Ford Doolittle and Richard Dawkins separately argued against this aspect of Gaia. Doolittle argued that nothing in the genome of individual organisms could provide the feedback mechanisms proposed by Lovelock, and therefore the Gaia hypothesis proposed no plausible mechanism and was unscientific. Dawkins meanwhile stated that for organisms to act in concert would require foresight and planning, which is contrary to the current scientific understanding of evolution. Like Doolittle, he also rejected the possibility that feedback loops could stabilize the system. Lynn Margulis, a microbiologist who collaborated with Lovelock in supporting the Gaia hypothesis, argued in 1999, that \\"Darwin's grand vision was not wrong, only incomplete. In accentuating the direct competition between individuals for resources as the primary selection mechanism, Darwin (and especially his followers) created the impression that the environment was simply a static arena\\". She wrote that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around \\"set points\\" as in homeostasis, but those set points change with time.Margulis, Lynn. Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution. Houston: Basic Book 1999 Evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton called the concept of Gaia Copernican, adding that it would take another Newton to explain how Gaian self-regulation takes place through Darwinian natural selection.Lovelock, James. The Vanishing Face of Gaia. Basic Books, 2009, pp. 195-197. More recently Ford Doolittle building on his and Inkpen's ITSNTS (It's The Singer Not The Song) proposal Doolittle WF, Inkpen SA. Processes and patterns of interaction as units of selection: An introduction to ITSNTS thinking. PNAS April 17, 2018 115 (16) 4006-4014 proposed that differential persistence can play a similar role to differential reproduction in evolution by natural selections, thereby providing a possible reconciliation between the theory of natural selection and the Gaia hypothesis Doolittle WF. Darwinizing Gaia. Journal of Theoretical BiologyVolume 434, 7 December 2017, Pages 11-19 . =Criticism in the 21st century= The Gaia hypothesis continues to be broadly skeptically received by the scientific community. For instance, arguments both for and against it were laid out in the journal Climatic Change in 2002 and 2003. A significant argument raised against it are the many examples where life has had a detrimental or destabilising effect on the environment rather than acting to regulate it. Several recent books have criticised the Gaia hypothesis, expressing views ranging from \\"... the Gaia hypothesis lacks unambiguous observational support and has significant theoretical difficulties\\" to \\"Suspended uncomfortably between tainted metaphor, fact, and false science, I prefer to leave Gaia firmly in the background\\" to \\"The Gaia hypothesis is supported neither by evolutionary theory nor by the empirical evidence of the geological record\\". The CLAW hypothesis, initially suggested as a potential example of direct Gaian feedback, has subsequently been found to be less credible as understanding of cloud condensation nuclei has improved. In 2009 the Medea hypothesis was proposed: that life has highly detrimental (biocidal) impacts on planetary conditions, in direct opposition to the Gaia hypothesis.Peter Ward (2009), The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?, In a 2013 book-length evaluation of the Gaia hypothesis considering modern evidence from across the various relevant disciplines, Toby Tyrrell concluded that: \\"I believe Gaia is a dead end. Its study has, however, generated many new and thought provoking questions. While rejecting Gaia, we can at the same time appreciate Lovelock's originality and breadth of vision, and recognise that his audacious concept has helped to stimulate many new ideas about the Earth, and to champion a holistic approach to studying it\\". Elsewhere he presents his conclusion \\"The Gaia hypothesis is not an accurate picture of how our world works\\". This statement needs to be understood as referring to the \\"strong\\" and \\"moderate\\" forms of Gaia‚Äîthat the biota obeys a principle that works to make Earth optimal (strength 5) or favourable for life (strength 4) or that it works as a homeostatic mechanism (strength 3). The latter is the \\"weakest\\" form of Gaia that Lovelock has advocated. Tyrrell rejects it. However, he finds that the two weaker forms of Gaia‚ÄîCoeveolutionary Gaia and Influential Gaia, which assert that there are close links between the evolution of life and the environment and that biology affects the physical and chemical environment‚Äîare both credible, but that it is not useful to use the term \\"Gaia\\" in this sense and that those two forms were already accepted and explained by the processes of natural selection and adaptation.

Overview =Traditional Somali music= Somali oud player Nuruddin Ali Amaan. Somali people have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore. Somali songs are pentatonic. That is, they only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or the Arabian peninsula, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (lahamiste), songwriters (abwaan), and vocalists (odka or \\"voice\\").Abdullahi, pp.170-171 The Somali word for dance is ciyaar. Traditional instruments prominently featured in the music of the northern areas (Somaliland) include the oud lute (kaban). It is often accompanied by small drums and a reed flute in the background. However, heavy percussion and metallic sounds are uncommon in the north. The southern riverine and coastal areas use a wide variety of traditional instruments including:Somali Culture and Folklore (1974) pp.63-64Historical Dictionary of Somalia (2003) p. 166The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. p.57-58 *Membranophones: nasaro, mokhoddon and masoondhe (high and heavy drums), reeme, jabbu and yoome (small drums); *Aerophones: malkad and siinbaar (flutes), sumaari (double clarinet), fuugwo (trumpet) buun, muufe and gees-goodir (horns); *Idiophones: shagal (metal clappers), shanbaal (wooden clappers), shunuuf (vegetable ankle rattles), tenegyo (xylophone), *Chordophones: shareero (lyre), kinaandha (lute), madhuube (thumb piano), seese (one-chord violin) History Somali singer Saado Ali Warsame receiving a Gold Record, Lifetime Achievement Award. Abdullahi Qarshe, popularly known as the father of Somali music. Somali popular music began with the balwo style, pioneered by Abdi Sinimo, who rose to fame in the early 1940s. This new genre then in turn created the Heelo style of Somali music. Abdi's innovation and passion for music revolutionized Somali music forever. Introduction of melody in modern Somali song is credited to Abdullahi Qarshe, who is recognised for introducing the kaban (oud) as an accompaniment to Somali music. Qarshe is revered by Somalis as \\"father of Somali music\\". Many qaraami songs from this era are still extremely popular today. This musical style is mostly played on the kaban (oud). Prominent Somali kaban players of the 1950s include Ali Feiruz and Mohamed Nahari. During fascist Somalia, music was suppressed except for a small amount of officially sanctioned music. There were many protest songs (pioneered by the people of Somaliland who were trying to separate and gain independence from the totalitarian neglectful government of Somalia to create their own stable, peaceful government) produced during this period. Bands such as Waaberi and Horseed have gained a small following outside of the country. Others, like Ahmed Ali Egal, Maryam Mursal and Waayaha Cusub have fused traditional Somali music with pop, rock and roll, bossa nova, jazz, and other modern influences. Music recorded in the 1970s was preserved in Hargeisa, buried underground, and is now available at the Red Sea Foundation at the Hargeisa Cultural Center, and in Radio Hargeisa. The Barre dictatorial regime effectively nationalised the music scene, with bands and production under state control. Bands were operated by the police, the army and the national penitentiary. Female singers were encouraged more than was the case in most of East Africa. Most musicians had left the country before 1991. Hiddo Dhawr is now operating as the only live music venue in the city. Music institutions The first radio station in Somalia to air popular Somali music was Radio Kudu based in Hargeisa, Somaliland. The first song to be broadcasted was composed by Guroon Jire in 1940 in English, Somali and Arabic, before being renamed the following year to Radio Somali. The head of the Music department was Mohamed Saeed (Guroon jire). Music is now regularly broadcast on the state-run Radio Mogadishu, as well as a number of private radio and popular television networks such as Horn Cable Television (a private company which is based in Somaliland).

The genus was formerly included in the lily family (Liliaceae).Bailey, L.H. & E.Z. Bailey. 1976. Hortus Third i‚Äìxiv, 1‚Äì1290. MacMillan, New York. The genus is native to temperate Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian Subcontinent, and some species have been introduced to, and are now naturalized in, other places such as New Zealand, Australia, Mexico and southwestern United States.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesAltervista Flora Italiana, genere Asphodelus includes photos plus European distribution maps Many asphodels are popular garden plants, which grow in well-drained soils with abundant natural light. Character The plants are hardy herbaceous perennials with narrow tufted radical leaves and an elongated stem bearing a handsome spike of white or yellow flowers. Asphodelus albus and A. fistulosus have white flowers and grow from 1¬Ω to 2 ft. high; A. ramosus is a larger plant, the large white flowers of which have a reddish-brown line in the middle of each segment. Uses The leaves are used to wrap burrata, an Italian cheese. The leaves and the cheese last about the same time, three or four days, and thus fresh leaves are a sign of a fresh cheese, while dried out leaves indicate that the cheese is past its prime. Mythology In Greek legend the asphodel is one of the most famous of the plants connected with the dead and the underworld. Homer describes it as covering the great meadow (), the haunt of the dead. It was planted on graves, and is often connected with Persephone, who appears crowned with a garland of asphodels. Its general connection with death is due no doubt to the greyish colour of its leaves and its yellowish flowers, which suggest the gloom of the underworld and the pallor of death. The roots were eaten by the poorer Greeks; hence such food was thought good enough for the shades. The asphodel was also supposed to be a remedy for poisonous snake- bites and a specific against sorcery; it was fatal to mice, but preserved pigs from disease. The Libyan nomads made their huts of asphodel stalks. Poetry The asphodel is mentioned by several poets in connection with the mythology of death, and by association, the afterlife - specifically the Isles of the Blessed and Elysium - part of the ancient Greek concept of the afterlife. :* Conrad Aiken: \\"Snowflake on asphodel‚Äîhow clear, how bright / Snow's death on dying flower, yet both immortal\\" :* Elizabeth Barrett Browning: \\"As one who stands in dewless asphodel, Looks backward on the tedious time he had In the upper life.\\" :* Florence Earle Coates: \\"beauty wove a magic spell/ For him, and early, at his need,/ Upon a bed of asphodel/ He found a tuneful reed\\" in poem \\"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\\" :* Leonard Cohen: \\"But in his lapel, discreetly, he wore a sprig of asphodel.\\" :* William Faulkner: \\"There asphodels are scattered through the night, Like ghosts of young beseeching hands.\\" ONE WHO WAS LEFT LIVING, CHANSONS AU PRINTEMPS, handwritten with drawings, 1919, W.

While at Maryland State College, Clemons also joined his first band, the Vibratones, which played James Brown covers and stayed together for about four years between 1961 and 1965. While still playing with this band, he moved to Somerset, New Jersey, where he worked as a counselor for emotionally disturbed children at the Jamesburg Training School for Boys between 1962 and 1970. Music career =E Street Band= Clemons stage front with the E Street Band, playing his famous \\"Jungleland\\" saxophone solo. Nassau Coliseum, March 10, 2008. Born to Run\\" saxophone solo with house lights up. Hartford Civic Center, April 24, 2009. The story of how Clemons first met Bruce Springsteen has entered into E Street Band mythology. \\"The E Street Shuffle\\" contains a monologue about how they met, and the event was also immortalized in \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\". They allegedly met for the first time in September 1971. At the time, Clemons was playing with Norman Seldin & the Joyful Noyze at The Wonder Bar in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Seldin was a Jersey Shore musician/entrepreneur who, as well as playing piano and leading various bands, had his own record label, Selsom Records. In 1969, Clemons had recorded an eponymous album with this band. In 2008, tracks from this album were reissued on an anthology, Asbury Park ‚Äî Then And Now, put together by Seldin. It was Karen Cassidy, lead vocalist with the Joyful Noyze, who encouraged Clemons to check out Springsteen, who was playing with the Bruce Springsteen Band at the nearby Student Prince. Clemons recalled their meeting in various interviews: > One night we were playing in Asbury Park. I'd heard The Bruce Springsteen > Band was nearby at a club called The Student Prince and on a break between > sets I walked over there. On-stage, Bruce used to tell different versions of > this story but I'm a Baptist, remember, so this is the truth. A rainy, windy > night it was, and when I opened the door the whole thing flew off its hinges > and blew away down the street. The band were on-stage, but staring at me > framed in the doorway. And maybe that did make Bruce a little nervous > because I just said, \\"I want to play with your band,\\" and he said, \\"Sure, > you do anything you want.\\" The first song we did was an early version of > \\"Spirit in the Night\\". Bruce and I looked at each other and didn't say > anything, we just knew. We knew we were the missing links in each other's > lives. He was what I'd been searching for. In one way he was just a scrawny > little kid. But he was a visionary. He wanted to follow his dream. So from > then on I was part of history. Well before this meeting, however, Clemons and Springsteen had moved within the same circle of musical acquaintances. Norman Seldin had managed and promoted several local bands, including The Motifs who featured Vinnie Roslin, later to play with Springsteen in Steel Mill. On April 22, 1966, Seldin had also organized a battle of the bands competition at the Matawan-Keyport Roller Drome in Matawan, New Jersey. Springsteen was among the entrants playing with his then band, The Castiles. Billy Ryan, who played lead guitar with The Joyful Noyze,Backstreets No.31 Winter 1990 also played in The Jaywalkers with Garry Tallent and Steve Van Zandt. Clemons himself had also played with Tallent in Little Melvin & The Invaders. In July 1972, Springsteen began recording his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and during breaks from recording, he jammed with Clemons and The Joyful Noyze on at least two occasions at The Shipbottom Lounge in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. When Springsteen then decided to use a tenor saxophone on the songs \\"Blinded by the Light\\" and \\"Spirit in the Night,\\" he called Clemons. By October Springsteen was ready to tour and promote Greetings‚Ä¶ and he put together a band featuring Clemons, Tallent, Danny Federici and Vini Lopez. Clemons played his last gig with Norman Seldin & The Joyful Noyze at the Club Plaza in Bayville, New Jersey, on October 21, 1972. Four days later Clemons made his debut with the formative E Street Band at an unadvertised, impromptu performance at The Shipbottom Lounge. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Clemons featured prominently on Springsteen's albums.Jon Pareles (June 19, 2011). \\"The Big Man, Much More Than Springsteen's Sideman\\". The New York Times, C1. Retrieved July 1, 2011. On Born to Run he provided memorable saxophone solos on the title track, \\"Thunder Road\\", \\"She's the One\\", \\"Night\\", and \\"Jungleland\\". Darkness on the Edge of Town featured notable solos by Clemons on \\"Badlands\\" and \\"The Promised Land\\". The River saw Clemons featured on songs such as \\"The Ties That Bind\\", \\"Sherry Darling\\", \\"I Wanna Marry You\\", \\"Drive All Night\\" and \\"Independence Day\\" while Born in the U.S.A. saw solos on \\"Bobby Jean\\" and \\"I'm Goin' Down\\". Springsteen and other members of the band referred to Clemons as \\"The Big Man\\". At the end of shows, while recognizing members of the E Street Band, Springsteen referred to Clemons as \\"The Biggest Man You Ever Seen\\". He sometimes changed this depending on where the E Street Band performs ‚Äî at their 2009 concert in Glasgow he introduced Clemons as \\"the biggest Scotsman you've ever seen\\". In April 2014, the E Street Band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Clemons' widow accepted on his behalf. =Solo career= Outside of his work with the E Street Band, Clemons recorded with many other artists and had a number of musical projects on his own. The best known of these are his 1985 vocal duet with Jackson Browne on the Top-20 hit single \\"You're a Friend of Mine\\", and his saxophone work on Aretha Franklin's 1985 Top-10 hit single \\"Freeway of Love\\". He was managed briefly in the 1980s by former Crawdaddy editor Peter Knobler, at whose wedding Clemons played with his band, Clarence Clemons & the Red Bank Rockers. During the 1980s, Clemons also owned a Red Bank, New Jersey, nightclub called Big Man's West. He toured in the first incarnation of Ringo Starr & The All-Starr Band in 1989, singing \\"You're a Friend of Mine\\" (dueting with Billy Preston) and an updated rap arrangement of \\"Quarter to Three.\\" In the mid-1990s, he recorded a Japan-only CD release called Aja and the Big Man \\"Get It On\\" with Los Angeles singer/songwriter Aja Kim. Clarence also sat in with the Grateful Dead during the Grateful Dead's Summer Solstice Simulcast concert in 1989. There is a video of this concert in circulation. In 1992 he was involved in the sessions for the album Zoom by Alvin Lee. At this time he also recorded an instrumental record with Alan Niven producing, Peacemaker. In the 2000s, Clemons along with producer Narada Michael Walden, put together a group called The Temple of Soul, releasing a single called \\"Anna\\". He also recorded with philanthropic teen band Creation. Clemons collaborated with Lady Gaga on the songs \\"Hair\\" and \\"The Edge of Glory\\" from her album Born This Way, providing a saxophone track and solo. Clemons occasionally sat in with the Grateful Dead and as recently as April 2011, sat in on several tunes with the Grateful Dead \\"spinoff\\" band Furthur during a concert in Boca Raton, Florida. Just days before he suffered a major stroke, he shot a music video with Lady Gaga for \\"The Edge of Glory\\".

He played one of the 'Three Most Important People In The World' in the 1989 comedy film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. In 1985, Clemons was a special guest star in Diff'rent Strokes episode \\"So You Want to Be a Rock Star\\", in which he played the role of Mr. Kingsley, a young saxophonist helping Arnold Jackson to learn to play his sax. He has also been a guest voice in an episode of The Simpsons. In 1990, he co-starred in the pilot episode of Human Target, a Rick Springfield action series intended for ABC.

Death Memorial display for Clemons at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey, June 2011 Clemons suffered a stroke in June 2011. He underwent two surgeries, after which he was declared to be in serious but stable condition. According to Rolling Stone magazine, he had been showing signs of recovery. However, on June 18, 2011, he died from complications caused by the stroke while in West Palm Beach, Florida. He was 69. Upon announcement of Clemons' death, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ordered all state flags to be lowered to half staff in his honor. He was survived by his four sons and his fifth wife, Victoria, whom he had married in 2008. Tributes and legacy Springsteen said of Clemons: At their concert in Portsmouth, Virginia, on June 19, 2011, Phish covered \\"Thunder Road\\" as a tribute to Clemons. At an Eddie Vedder concert in Hartford, Connecticut on June 18, 2011, Vedder wished Clemons well, and was soon notified by a sound tech that Clemons had died. Vedder later played a tribute to Clemons during Pearl Jam song \\"Better Man\\" changing the lyrics to include, \\"Can't find a Bigger Man\\" (paying homage to Clemons' nickname \\"The Big Man\\"). During a subsequent performance on the Late Show with David Letterman, Vedder played a ukulele with \\"Clarence\\" written across the front of it. Before singing \\"Moment of Surrender\\" at the U2 concert in Anaheim on June 18, 2011, Bono paid tribute to Clemons. He read lyrics from Springsteen's \\"Jungleland\\" near the end of the song, and repeated them at the song's conclusion. Bono repeated this dedication and tribute during \\"Moment of Surrender\\" at the U2 concert in New Jersey on June 21 and again in Baltimore on June 22. Bon Jovi performed \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" as the first encore during their concert in Horsens on June 19, 2011. While playing that song, photos of Clemons were shown on the giant video screen behind the band. Jimmy Buffett added verses that included Clemons in \\"The Stories We Could Tell\\" during his final encore during his concert on June 21, 2011. The rest of the band left the stage and it was Buffett playing and singing alone. During The Gaslight Anthem's set at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, frontman Brian Fallon dedicated their song \\"The '59 Sound\\" to Clemons. On July 17, 2011, a tribute concert was held at the Wonder Bar in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Springsteen performed a 45-minute set playing some of Clemons' songs. Clemons' son, Clarence III, (known as Nick), opened the show with his band, The Nick Clemons Band. On October 1, 2011, a tribute to Clemons took place at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Traditionally an annual charity event hosted by Clemons called The Classic Rock & Roll Party, the event paid tribute to Clemons' life and all he did for Home Safe, a non-profit organization helping victims of child abuse and domestic violence. In January 2012, Clemons' hometown paid tribute with memorial concerts featuring members of the E Street Band. The concert took place at The NorVa concert hall. In October 2011 Lady Gaga paid tribute to him when she accepted the \\"Big Man of the Year\\" from Little Kids Rock. In a June 21, 2012 concert in Sydney, Australia Gaga dedicated her song \\"The Edge of Glory\\" in which Clemons has contributed. On July 28, 2012, in Gothenburg, Springsteen and the E Street Band performed \\"Jungleland\\" for the first time on the Wrecking Ball World Tour, with Clemons' nephew Jake Clemons playing the saxophone solo and the song being dedicated to Clemons.

It was originally called , but its name was later changed to the more popular Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (\\"Grass-Cutting Sword\\"). In folklore, the sword represents the virtue of valor. Legends Susanoo holds the Kusanagi no Tsurugi while slaying the eight-headed beast Yamata-no-Orochi The history of the Kusanagi- no-Tsurugi extends into legend. According to Kojiki, the god Susanoo encountered a grieving family of kunitsukami (\\"gods of the land\\") headed by in Izumo Province. When Susanoo inquired of Ashinazuchi, he told him that his family was being terrorized by the fearsome Yamata no Orochi, an eight-headed serpent of Koshi, who had consumed seven of the family's eight daughters and that the creature was coming for his final daughter, . Susanoo investigated the creature, and after an abortive encounter he returned with a plan to defeat it. In return, he asked for Kushinada-hime's hand in marriage, which was agreed. Transforming her temporarily into a comb (one interpreter reads this section as \\"using a comb he turns into [masquerades as] Kushinada-hime\\") to have her company during battle, he detailed his plan into steps. He instructed that eight vats of sake (rice wine) be prepared and put on individual platforms positioned behind a fence with eight gates. The monster took the bait and put one of its heads through each gate. With this distraction, Susanoo attacked and slew the beast (with his sword Worochi no Ara-masa), chopping off each head and then proceeded to do the same to the tails. In the fourth tail, he discovered a great sword inside the body of the serpent which he called Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi. He presented the sword to the goddess Amaterasu to settle an old grievance. Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya dates back to c. 100 CE during the reign of Emperor Keik≈ç and houses the Kusanagi sword. Generations later, during the reign of the twelfth Emperor, Keik≈ç, Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi was given to the great warrior, Yamato Takeru as part of a pair of gifts given by his aunt, Yamatohime-no-mikoto, the Shrine Maiden of Ise Shrine, to protect her nephew in times of peril. These gifts came in handy when Yamato Takeru was lured onto an open grassland during a hunting expedition by a treacherous warlord. The lord had fiery arrows loosed to ignite the grass and trap Yamato Takeru in the field so that he would burn to death. He also killed the warrior's horse to prevent his escape. Desperately, Yamato Takeru used the Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi to cut back the grass and remove fuel from the fire, but in doing so, he discovered that the sword enabled him to control the wind and cause it to move in the direction of his swing. Taking advantage of this magic, Yamato Takeru used his other gift, fire strikers, to enlarge the fire in the direction of the lord and his men, and he used the winds controlled by the sword to sweep the blaze toward them. In triumph, Yamato Takeru renamed the sword Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (\\"Grass- Cutting Sword\\") to commemorate his narrow escape and victory. Eventually, Yamato Takeru married and later fell in battle against a monster, after ignoring his wife's advice to take the sword with him. Folklore Although the sword is mentioned in the Kojiki, this book is a collection of Japanese myths and is not considered a historical document. The first reliable historical mention of the sword is in the Nihonshoki. Although the Nihonshoki also contains mythological stories that are not considered reliable history, it records some events that were contemporary or nearly contemporary to its writing, and these sections of the book are considered historical. In the Nihonshoki, the Kusanagi was removed from the Imperial palace in 688, and moved to Atsuta Shrine after the sword was blamed for causing Emperor Tenmu to fall ill. Along with the jewel (Yasakani no Magatama) and the mirror (Yata no Kagami), it is one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan, the sword representing the virtue of valor. Artist's impressions of the (unseen) Imperial Regalia of Japan Kusanagi is allegedly kept at Atsuta Shrine but is not available for public display. During the Edo period, while performing various repairs and upkeep at Atsuta Shrine, including replacement of the outer wooden box housing the sword, the Shinto priest Matsuoka Masanao claimed to have been one of several priests to have seen the sword. Per his account, \\"a stone box was inside a wooden box of length 150 cm, with red clay stuffed into the gap between them. Inside the stone box was a hollowed log of a camphor tree, acting as another box, with an interior lined with gold. Above that was placed a sword. Red clay was also stuffed between the stone box and the camphor tree box. The sword was about 82 cm long. Its blade resembled a calamus leaf. The middle of the sword had a thickness from the grip about 18cm with an appearance like a fish spine. The sword was fashioned in a white metallic color, and well maintained.\\" After witnessing the sword, the grand priest was banished and the other priests, except for Matsuoka, died from strange diseases. The above account therefore comes from the only survivor, Matsuoka.First appears in from around 1725, written by Tamaki Masahide, a Shinto priest of Umenomiya Shrine. This text is then mentioned in the , published 1898, written by Kurita Hiroshi. Kokugakuin. http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/815487 In The Tale of the Heike, a collection of oral stories transcribed in 1371, the sword is lost at sea after the defeat of the Heike in the Battle of Dan-no-ura, a naval battle that ended in the defeat of the Heike clan forces and the child Emperor Antoku at the hands of Minamoto no Yoshitsune. In the tale, upon hearing of the Navy's defeat, the Emperor's grandmother, Taira no Tokiko, led the Emperor and his entourage to commit suicide by drowning in the waters of the strait, taking with her two of the three Imperial Regalia: the sacred jewel and the sword Kusanagi. The sacred mirror was recovered in extremis when one of the ladies- in-waiting was about to jump with it into the sea. Although the sacred jewel is said to have been found in its casket floating on the waves, Kusanagi was lost forever. Although written about historical events, The Tale of the Heike is a collection of epic poetry passed down orally and written down nearly 200 years after the actual events, so its reliability as an historical document is questionable. Another story holds that the sword was reportedly stolen again in the sixth century by a monk from Silla. However, his ship allegedly sank at sea, allowing the sword to wash ashore at Ise, where it was recovered by Shinto priests. Current status Due to the Shinto priests' refusal to show the sword, and the rather unreliable nature of its historical references, the current state of ‚Äî or even the existence of ‚Äî the sword as a historical artifact cannot be confirmed. The most recent appearance of the sword was in 2019 when Emperor Akihito abdicated from the throne; the sword (as well as the jewel Yasakani no Magatama, the Emperor's privy seal and the State Seal) were shrouded in packages.

Historically in the East Division of Staincliffe Wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is on the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the south of the Yorkshire Dales. It is situated north-west of Leeds and west of York. At the 2011 Census, the population was 14,623. The town was listed in the 2018 Sunday Times report on Best Places to Live in northern England. History Skipton Castle The name Skipton means 'sheep-town', a northern dialect form of Shipton.The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-names, ed. by Victor Watts (Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 2004), 554 The name is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. It was important during the English Civil War and was the site of a prisoner of war camp during the First World War. One of the oldest mills in North Yorkshire, High Corn Mill is powered by the waters of Eller Beck, and dates to 1310 when it was owned by Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford; at that point it was transferred to the powerful Clifford family by the then King Edward II. The mill as it appears today is only half of what used to exist when two mills were in operation to produce corn for the whole of Skipton. The mill has been completely redesigned, from the mill grounds to the buildings themselves. The outside walls of the mill have been sandblasted and the two main buildings of the old mill have been turned into flats from 2007 onwards, with one stand-alone building yet to be redesigned, touched or Sandblasted. Skipton Castle was built in 1090 as a wooden motte- and-bailey by Robert de Romille, a Norman baron. In the 12th century William le Gros strengthened it with a stone keep to repel attacks from the Kingdom of Scotland to the north, the castle elevated Skipton from a poor dependent village to a burgh administered by a reeve. The protection offered by Skipton Castle during the Middle Ages encouraged the urbanisation of the surrounding area, and during times of war and disorder the town attracted an influx of families. It is now one of the most complete and best preserved medieval castles in England and is open to the public. Skipton became a prosperous market town, trading sheep and woollen goods: its name derives from the Old English sceap (sheep) and tun (town or village). A market stemming from its formative years still survives. In the 19th century, Skipton emerged as a small mill town connected to the major cities by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and its branch Thanet Canal, (known locally as 'Springs branch canal'), but during the 20th century Skipton's economy shifted to tourism, aided by its historic architecture and proximity to the Yorkshire Dales. Since 1974, Skipton has been the seat of Craven District Council. The Skipton Building Society was founded in the town. In 2016 Skipton was voted the best place to live in England for the second time, having been voted for by the Sunday Times, two years earlier. Governance Skipton is part of the parliamentary constituency of Skipton and Ripon, which was created in 1983. The constituency has returned a Conservative MP since its inception. The seat is currently held by Julian Smith MP. Before 1983 Skipton had its own eponymous constituency. Skipton forms part of Craven District, a non-metropolitan district, and is home of the offices of Craven District Council. In 2007, proposals to make North Yorkshire County Council a unitary authority, removing the layer of government represented by Craven District, were rejected. Skipton has its own town council consisting of 16 councillors, formed by 4 members from each of the four wards within the parish boundaries, North, East, South and West. Skipton town councillors elect a town mayor each year at an annual general meeting. As of 2018, the town mayor is Councillor Alan Hickman. The town council offices are based on the high street, upstairs in the Town Hall. Economy The Bailey, headquarters of the Skipton Building Society. The town's major local employer is Skipton Building Society, with its subsidiary companies. The town is home to several holiday companies, including Blue Water Holidays and several cottage holiday firms. It is a centre for recruitment agencies, with several hundred people employed in this sector. Recruitment firms include Medacs, HCL Doctors, Templars, Holt Doctors and Medic International and Justteachers. Tourism and retail sales are also significant. The Global Environmental Engineer JBA Consulting is headquartered here. There is a recruitment software company called LMS Recruitment Systems Ltd. The town is known as the \\"Gateway to the Dales\\", because of its close proximity to the Yorkshire Dales. Skipton has many visitors, particularly on market days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday). As Skipton is the nearest and largest town to most of the small towns and villages within the Dales, it attracts numerous shoppers. In 2008, the Academy of Urbanism voted High Street the best shopping spot in Britain. The wide main street used to host the sheep market, but now a general market is held there four days a week and livestock is auctioned at the Auction Mart on the western edge of the town. The town has three official allotment sites. Chocolatier Whittakers, now based in the town, was established in 1889 in nearby Cross Hills. Ida Whittaker began making chocolates there in 1903, taught by the wife of the vicar of Kildwick. Culture and community High Street, Skipton Holy Trinity Church (Church of England) On Saturday 13 July 1901, a gala was held in Skipton to raise money for the Skipton and District Cottage Hospital, built at the time of Queen Victoria's Jubilee, held on the Brick Buildings Fields off Bailey Road. This was such a major event in the area that extra trains were provided to bring visitors to the town from miles around. After the formation of the National Health Service, with the Skipton General Hospital being funded from central government, the Skipton Charities Gala continued raising money for local charities and non-profit-making organisations. The gala, held every year on the second Saturday in June, starts with a procession through the town centre to Aireville Park, where live performance acts entertain the public, culminating in live music and a firework display. Today, main events in Skipton include the annual heritage event Skipton Sheep Day which takes place on the first Sunday in July on Skipton High Street and showcases what Skipton and the Yorkshire Dales has to offer with demonstrations, stalls, entertainment and food on offer. Another main event on the annual calendar is Skipton Christmas Market which has been constantly voted in the top 10 of the UK's best Christmas Markets. Craven Museum & Gallery Skipton Town Hall holds regular craft fairs and special events and houses the Craven Museum & Gallery as well as a tourist information centre. Skipton Little Theatre is located near the town centre. The Mart Theatre opened in October 2005 with funding from the European Regional Development Fund, Yorkshire Forward, Craven District Council and the Arts Council England. It provides rural theatre, events and other facilities within a functioning Auction Mart. In March 2014 The Sunday Times judged Skipton as the \\"best place to live\\" in Britain. In 2016 the paper said it was amongst the nine best towns in Yorkshire and the North East due to its market, schools and being close to the Dales, Skipton is twinned with the Bavarian town of Simbach. In May 2009 the town council decided to proceed with twinning with Erquinghem-Lys in France. Skipton has numerous public houses, three nightclubs and several restaurants. The local newspaper is the Craven Herald & Pioneer. Transport Skipton Waterway Festival Skipton railway station Skipton lies close to the junction of the A65 road (from Leeds to the Lake District) and the A59 from York to Liverpool. The north section (A65 & A59) of the ¬£16.4 million Skipton Bypass opened in December 1981. The rest of the bypass (A629) opened in October 1982, greatly reducing journey times to the Dales. Skipton railway station gives access southbound to regular services for Leeds and Bradford on the electrified Airedale Line; northbound services connect to Lancaster, Morecambe and Carlisle, The latter route is along the scenic Settle-Carlisle Railway, passing over the Ribblehead Viaduct.

Also, whilst 16 Air Assault Brigade is apparently the only fighting brigade listed with its own organic helicopter support in this order of battle, 3 Commando Brigade had the helicopters on board Ocean and Ark Royal to call upon, and 7 Armoured Brigade wasn't really air mobile as a formation. There were also the RAF Pumas and Chinooks mentioned above for transport purposes. Special Forces elements of the British Army (Special Air Service) and Royal Marines (Special Boat Service) were also deployed but as the British government policy is not to comment on special forces activity, the exact details or elements deployed are officially unconfirmed. The contribution of reservists to the deployment (some 9,500 of the 46,000 personnel involved in the warfighting phase and its immediate aftermath, the vast majority from the Territorial Army, and in significant number in the subsequent roulements) is understated by the order of battle, as the only units to deploy in their entirety were 202 Field Hospital (with augmentees from the other TAVR Field Hospitals), 131 Independent Commando Squadron of the Royal Engineers as well as A (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) Squadron and W (Westminster Dragoons) Squadron of the Royal Yeomanry. The remainder were augmentees, called up individually from their units (which therefore do not feature in the order of battle) and employed to bring many of the units listed above up to their war-fighting strength. Finally, 3 Commando Brigade had a United States Marine Corps unit, 15th MEU under its command in the initial stages of the war. This went back to American command around 25 March. Roulements 1st Armoured Division remained in theatre, controlling UK ground forces until June 2003, when 3rd Mechanised Division's HQ arrived in theatre to take command of British forces.

It is triggered by the presence or actions of the victim and sometimes has some form of bait designed to lure the victim towards it. The trap may be set to act upon trespassers that enter restricted areas, and it can be triggered when the victim performs an action (e.g., opening a door, picking something up, or switching something on). It can also be triggered by vehicles driving along a road, as in the case of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Booby traps should not be confused with mantraps which are designed to catch a person. Lethal booby traps are often used in warfare, particularly guerrilla warfare, and traps designed to cause injury or pain are also sometimes used by criminals wanting to protect drugs or other illicit property, and by some owners of legal property who wish to protect it from theft. Booby traps which merely cause discomfort or embarrassment are a popular form of practical joke. Etymology The Spanish word bobo translates to \\"stupid, daft, na√Øve, simple, fool, idiot, clown, funny man, one who is easily cheated\\" and similar pejorative terms. The slang of bobo, bubie, translates to \\"dunce\\". Variations of this word exist in other languages (such as Latin), with their meaning being \\"to stammer\\". In approximately 1590, the word began appearing in the English language as booby, meaning \\"stupid person, slow bird\\". The seabird in question was the genus Sula, with their common name being boobies. These birds have large flat feet and wide wingspans for marine habitats but are clumsy and slow on shore making them easy to catch. The birds are also known for landing aboard seagoing vessels, whereupon they have been eaten by the crew. The phrase booby trap originally applied to schoolboy pranks, but took on its more sinister connotation during World War I. The term \\"booby trap\\" gives rise to the idea that an individual with the misfortune to be caught in the trap does so because the individual is a \\"booby\\", or that an individual who is caught in the trap thereby becomes a \\"booby\\". The word itself now has formal usage and a legal definition, as per the Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices. Military booby traps Vietnam War: Republic of Korea Armed Forces soldiers show Vietnamese villagers types of Viet Cong booby traps. A group of 105mm artillery shells with plastic explosive stuffed into their fuze pockets. Each of the 5 shells has been linked together with red detcord to make them detonate simultaneously. To turn this assembly into a booby trap, the final step would be to connect an M142 firing device to the detcord and hide everything under some form of cover e.g. newspapers or a bed-sheet. Boobytrap firing devices, c. 1941: Press, pull and release switches; mass-produced components intended for the construction of booby traps. A military booby trap may be designed to kill or injure a person who activates its trigger, or employed to reveal the location of an enemy by setting off a signalling device. Most, but not all, military booby traps involve explosives. There is no clear division between a booby trap and buried conventional land mines triggered by a tripwire or directional mine. Other, similar devices include spring-guns and mechanisms such as the SM-70 directional antipersonnel mine. What distinguishes a booby trap is that its activation is intended to be unexpected to its victim. Thus booby trap design is widely varied, with traps or their trigger mechanisms often hidden. Frequently at least part of the device is improvised from standard ordnance, such as an artillery shell, grenade, or high explosive. However, some mines have features specifically designed for incorporation into booby traps and armies have been equipped with a variety of mass-produced triggering mechanisms intended to be employed in booby traps deployment. Part of the skill in placing booby traps lies in exploiting natural human behaviors such as habit, self-preservation, curiosity or acquisitiveness. A common trick is to provide victims with a simple solution to a problem, for example, leaving only one door open in an otherwise secure building, thereby luring them straight toward the firing mechanism. An example that exploits an instinct for self-preservation was used in the Vietnam War. Spikes known as punji sticks were hidden in grassy areas. When fired upon soldiers instinctively sought to take cover by throwing themselves down on the ground, impaling themselves on the spikes. Attractive or interesting objects are frequently used as bait. For example, troops could leave behind empty beer bottles and a sealed wooden packing case with \\"Scotch Whisky\\" marked on it before leaving an area. The rubble-filled packing case might be resting on top of an M5 or M142 firing device, connected to some blocks of TNT or to some C4 explosive stuffed into the empty fuze pocket of a mortar shell. Alternatively, the weight of the packing case might simply be holding down the arming lever of an RGD-5 grenade with a zero-delay fuze fitted and the pin removed. Either way, when the case is moved, the booby trap detonates, killing or severely injuring anyone in the immediate area. Many different types of bait object can be used e.g. soldiers will be tempted to kick an empty beer can lying on the ground as they walk past it. However, the can (partially filled with sand to add weight) may be resting on top of an M5 pressure-release firing device screwed into a buried M26 grenade. Many purpose-built booby-trap firing devices exist such as the highly versatile M142 universal firing device (identical to the British L5A1 or Australian F1A1), or Yugoslavian UMNOP-1 which allow a variety of different ways of triggering explosives e.g. via trip wire (either pulling it or releasing the tension on it), direct pressure on an object (e.g. standing on it), or pressure release (lift/shift something) etc. Almost any item can be booby-trapped in some way. For example, booby trapping a flashlight is a classic tactic: a flashlight already contains most of the required components. First of all, the flashlight acts as bait, tempting the victim to pick it up. More importantly, it is easy to conceal a detonator, some explosives, and batteries inside the flashlight casing. A simple electrical circuit is connected to the on/off switch. When the victim attempts to turn the flashlight on to see if it works, the resulting explosion blows their hand or arm off and possibly blinds them. The only limits to the intricacy of booby- traps are the skill and inventiveness of the people placing them. For example, the \\"bait object\\" (e.g. a cash box in a corner of the room) which lures victims into the trap may not in fact be booby-trapped at all. However, the furniture which must be pushed away in order to get to the bait has a wire attached, with an M142 firing device connected to a 155mm artillery shell on the other end of it. A booby trap may be of any size. However, as a general rule the size of most explosive booby traps use between 250 g and 1 kg of explosive. Since most booby traps are rigged to detonate within a metre of the victim's body, this is adequate to kill or severely wound. As a rule, booby- traps are planted in any situation where there is a strong likelihood of them being encountered and triggered by the targeted victims. Typically, they are planted in places that people are naturally attracted to or are forced to use. The list of likely placement areas includes: * the only abandoned houses left standing in a village, which may attract enemy soldiers seeking shelter. * a door, drawer or cupboard inside a building that someone will open without thinking of what might be connected to it. If a door is locked, this makes people believe there could something valuable behind it so they are more likely to kick it open, with fatal results. * vehicles abandoned by the roadside, perhaps with some kind of victim \\"bait\\" left on the back seat such as a suitcase or large cardboard box. * natural choke-points, such as the only footbridge across a river, which people must use whether they want to or not. * important strategic installations such as airfields, railway stations and harbour facilities, all of which the invading forces will want to occupy and use. * anything of use or value that people would naturally want to possess or which makes them curious to see what is inside it, e.g. a crate of beer, a pistol, a jerry can, a flashlight, discarded army rucksack or even a picture torn out of a pornographic magazine. A booby trap does not necessarily incorporate explosives in its construction. Examples include the punji sticks mentioned above and deadfall traps which employ heavy objects set up to fall on and crush whoever disturbs the trigger mechanism. However, setting non- explosive booby traps is labour-intensive and time-consuming, they are harder to conceal and they are less likely to do serious damage. In contrast, booby traps containing explosives are much more destructive: they will either kill their victims or severely wound them. =Effects= In addition to the obvious ability of booby traps to kill or injure, their presence has other effects such as these: * demoralize soldiers as booby traps kill or maim comrades * keep soldiers continually stressed, suspicious and unable to relax because it is difficult for them to know which areas, buildings or objects are safe * slow down troop movement as soldiers are forced to sweep areas to see if there are more booby traps. * make soldiers cautious instead of aggressive and confident * create no-go areas (real or imagined) after a booby trap has killed or wounded someone * cause a section or platoon to have to stop in order to deal with casualties, thus slowing and delaying those troops * create confusion and disorientation as a prelude to an ambush Booby traps are indiscriminate weapons. Like anti-personnel mines, they can harm civilians and other unsuspecting noncombatants (during and after the conflict) who are unaware of their presence. =Usage throughout history= A type of booby-trap was referred to in an 1839 news story in The Times.Allegedly made to injure an actress, Mrs. Charles Mathews, a parcel left for her at the Olympic Theatre contained a mahogany box, within which was an apparent explosive device:‚ÄòOn the interior of the lid was fastened a small parcel, neatly made up, supposed to contain detonating powder,...beneath which was attached a piece of sand- paper, which was so placed as to act upon several matches, and thus set fire to a quantity of gunpowder...the strings, which were attached to the piece of twine fastened to the cover...were so contrived as to act as a trigger, so that the moment the lid should be raised the whole...would instantly explode.‚Äô Although the newspaper carried the story, it did so sceptically and described it as a 'hoax'. The Times (London, England),6 March 1839, p.6 During the Vietnam War, motorcycles were rigged with explosives by the National Liberation Front and abandoned. U.S. soldiers would be tempted to ride the motorcycle and thus trigger the explosives. In addition, NLF soldiers would rig rubber band grenades and place them in huts that US soldiers would likely burn. Another popular booby trap was the \\"Grenade in a Can\\", a grenade with the safety pin removed in a container and a string attached, sometimes with the grenade's fuse mechanism modified to give a much shorter delay than the four to seven seconds typical with grenade fuses. The NLF soldiers primarily used these on doors and attached them to tripwires on jungle paths. The CIA and Green Berets countered by booby-trapping the enemy's ammunition supplies, in an operation code-named \\"Project Eldest Son.\\" The propellant in a rifle or machine-gun cartridge was replaced with high explosive. Upon being fired, the sabotaged round would destroy the gun and kill or injure the shooter. Mortar shells were similarly rigged to explode when dropped down the tube, instead of launching properly. This ammunition was then carefully re-packed to eliminate any evidence of tampering, and planted in enemy munitions dumps by covert insertion teams. A sabotaged round might also be planted in a rifle magazine or machine-gun belt and left on the body of a dead NLF soldier, in anticipation that the deceased's ammo would be picked up and used by his comrades. No more than one sabotaged round would be planted in any case, magazine, or belt of ammunition, to reduce the chances of the enemy finding it no matter how diligently they inspected their supplies. False rumors and forged documents were circulated to make it appear that the Communist Chinese were supplying the NLF with defective weapons and ammunition. Northern Ireland During the \\"Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland, booby trap bombs were often used by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) to kill British Army soldiers and Royal Ulster Constabulary officers. A common method was attaching the bomb to a vehicle so that starting or driving it would detonate the explosive. According to the Sutton Index of Deaths, 180 deaths during the Troubles were the result of booby trap bombs, the vast majority of them laid by the Provisional IRA. Middle East During the Al-Aqsa Intifada, some Arab-Palestinian groups made wide use of booby traps. The largest use of booby traps (between 2000‚Äì2005, the period of the Intifada) was in the Battle of Jenin during Operation Defensive Shield where a large number (1000-2000 according to Palestinian militant captured in Jenin during the battle ) of explosive devices were planted by insurgents. Booby traps had been laid in the streets of both the camp and the town, ready to be triggered if a foot snagged a tripwire or a vehicle rolled over a mine. Some of the bombs were huge, containing as much as 250 lb (110 kg) of explosives. To counter the booby traps, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines the IDF sent armored D9 bulldozers to clear the area out of any explosive device and booby trap planted. The IDF D9 bulldozers were heavily armored and thus did not sustain any damage from the explosions, which were triggered by them as they pushed forwards. Eventually, a dozen D9 bulldozers went into action, razing the center of the refugee camp and forcing the Palestinian militants inside to surrender. =Gallery= As a rule, most purpose-made military booby-trap firing devices contain some form of spring-loaded firing pin designed to strike a percussion cap connected to a detonator at one end. The detonator is inserted into an explosive charge e.g. C4 or a block of TNT. Triggering the booby-trap (e.g. by pulling on a trip-wire) releases the cocked firing pin which flips forward to strike the percussion cap, firing both it and the attached detonator. The resulting shock-wave from the detonator sets off the main explosive charge.

Laws vary: the creator of the trap may be immune from prosecution since the victim is trespassing, or the home owner may be held liable for injuries caused to the trespasser. Booby traps can also be a manner in which one can catch a criminal vandalizing items or areas in which there was no permission given to enter. Computer viruses Many computer viruses take the form of booby traps in that they are triggered when an unsuspecting user performs an apparently ordinary action such as opening an email attachment. Practical jokes Instead of being used to kill, maim or injure people, booby traps can also be used for entertainment. Practical joke booby traps are typically disguised as everyday items such as cigars or packets of chewing gum, nuts or other snack items. When the victims attempts to use the item, the trap is triggered. Two of the best known examples of this are the exploding cigar and dribble glass; others include the Snake Nut Can and shocking gum. Booby traps can also be constructed out of household or workplace items and be triggered when the victim performs a common action. Examples of this include loosening the bolts in a chair so that it collapses when sat upon, or placing a bucket of water on top of a partly open door so that when the door is fully opened, the bucket tips onto the victim. A variant is the water bucket which when \\"thrown\\" at the target, is full of confetti.

It was the last of the United Kingdom's second generation nuclear power plants to be commissioned. Construction of this facility began in 1980 for the then South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB) and it was commissioned in 1988. It is a local landmark, highly visible from the main A1 road and East Coast Main Line railway.  History  After extensive discussions with the local planning authority and more than twenty other interested organisations, the SSEB sought approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland in 1973 for Torness as a site for a nuclear power station. A public exhibition was held at Dunbar in February 1974 to explain the Board's proposals, and in June 1974, a public inquiry was held. There was widespread public opposition to the building of a nuclear plant at Torness. Diverse campaigning groups came together to highlight the environmental and human cost of nuclear power stations. In May 1978 4000 people marched from Dunbar to occupy the Torness site. Many of them signed a declaration to ‚Äútake all nonviolent steps necessary to prevent the construction of a nuclear power station at Torness‚Äù. The SSEB submitted designs for four types of reactor then being considered by HM Government for the next stage of the UK civil nuclear programme: the advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR), the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor (SGHWR), the Light Water Reactor (LWR) and the High Temperature Reactor (HTR). In February 1975, the Secretary of State for Scotland granted the SSEB statutory consent for the location of future nuclear power stations and, after review of the four alternative reactor types, consent was given on 24 May 1978 for construction of the AGR station. The construction, which was undertaken by a consortium known as National Nuclear Corporation ('NNC'), began in 1980. The reactors were supplied by NNC, the boilers by NEI and the turbines by GEC. Torness was the last of the United Kingdom's second generation nuclear power plants to be commissioned (25 May 1988). The station consists of two advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR) capable of producing a peak rating of 1364 MWe. Upon deregulation of the United Kingdom's electricity generation market it passed to the state-owned Scottish Nuclear, privatised as part of British Energy which was sold to the French company EDF in January 2009, and incorporated in the latter's UK subsidiary EDF Energy. It is expected to operate until 2030.  Plant design  The station viewed from the east Torness shares its design with Heysham 2 nuclear power station. The station was designed by NNC, a company created from the gradual amalgamation of five consortia that were formed in the 1950s and 1960s to build the UK's commercial nuclear power stations. NNC is now part of Jacobs Engineering Group. The graphite- moderated, gas-cooled design was proven at the WAGR ‚Äì the Windscale experimental AGR facility and is a significant evolution of the Magnox reactor designs. The entire UK commercial reactor programme shares a common heritage with, and was built on operating experience gained from the early PIPPA reactors at Calder Hall and Chapelcross and prior to that, the Windscale piles. When first operated Torness probably had the most sophisticated and complex computerised control system for a nuclear power station worldwide, and a far more sophisticated than earlier members of the advanced gas-cooled reactor fleet. Over 70 Ferranti Argus 700 computers are used in the control and instrumentation systems, which included Digital Direct Control (DDC) of the reactors. Nuclear fuel for Torness power station can be delivered and removed via a loading/unloading facility on a branch from the adjacent East Coast Main Line.  Operating experience and incidents  Details of incidents are published on the web site of the Health and Safety Executive in its quarterly statements of nuclear incidents at nuclear installationshttp://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/quarterly-stat/ and quarterly inspection reports for each nuclear licensed site. = Crash of an RAF Tornado near the site - November 1999 = In November 1999 an RAF Panavia Tornado F.3 crashed into the North Sea less than 1 km from the power station following an engine failure. The UK Ministry of Defence commended the two crew members for demonstrating \\"exceptional levels of airmanship and awareness in the most adverse of conditions\\", because they ensured that the Tornado was clear of the power station before abandoning the aircraft.Pilots praised over Tornado crash BBC News, 11 March 2002 = Failure of a gas circulator ‚Äì May 2002 = This was thought, from forensic evidence, to be linked to the development of an unexpected fatigue-related crack in part of the impeller. In August, another gas circulator on the other Torness reactor showed signs of increasing vibration and was promptly shut down by the operators. Its subsequent disassembly revealed a fully developed fatigue related crack in a similar position to the first failure, but the prompt shutdown had prevented consequential damage.Statement of nuclear incidents at nuclear installations 1 July 2002 - 30 September 2002 HSE, 2002 = Unplanned power excursion ‚Äì December 2005 = An unplanned power increase on Reactor 2 at Torness during the night shift of 30 December 2005. Operators responded to the event by taking corrective action to restore normal core reactivity levels. Station and Company investigations identified that improvement to the training of operators covering reactivity fundamentals is appropriate.British Energy Generation (UK) Ltd Torness Power Station Quarterly report for 1 April to 30 June 2006 HSE, 2006 = Shutdown after drumscreen blockage by seaweed ‚Äì August 2006 = Complete blockage by seaweed of the main cooling water intake drum- screens is an initiating event considered in the Station Safety Report (SSR). The event resulted in supplies of main cooling water being lost for a period. As a consequence, water supplies to the reactor seawater (RSW) system, which provides a safety role, were lost for a time on one reactor and restricted on the other. The station responded to the event by shutting down both reactors within 70 minutes of receiving the first indication of impaired main cooling water flow and provided adequate post trip cooling.Nuclear Safety Newsletter HSE, December 2006 = Shutdown after sea-water intake blockage by jellyfish ‚Äì June 2011 = On 28 June 2011IAEA IRS report dated 30 October 2012 (not public) both reactors were manually shut down due to reduced flow of sea water at intakes by a large mass of jellyfish.

The area is known for its airfield which was constructed in 1915 to help protect Britain from attack by German Zeppelin airships during the First World War. The RNAS airship station also included an airship hangar. In 1919 the British airship R34 made the first airship crossing of the Atlantic, flying from East Fortune to Mineola, New York.http://heritage.scotsman.com/ingenuity.cfm?id=430902005 The name may mean \\"settlement where hogs are farmed\\", from Old English f≈çr, a hog, and t≈´n, a settlement. In 1922 several buildings and an area of land were used to create East Fortune Hospital. This served as a tuberculosis sanatorium for the south east region of Scotland until the onset of World War II. The airfield was then brought back into service as RAF East Fortune, initially a training airfield, and the hospital patients were transferred to Bangour Hospital in West Lothian. The hospital re-opened after the war, but by 1956, as the number of tuberculosis patients began to fall, the hospital changed its function to house the mentally handicapped. In 1997, the hospital closed down, and its patients were transferred to Roodlands Hospital in Haddington. For a short period in 1961, East Fortune operated as Edinburgh's airport while facilities at Turnhouse were being reconstructed. In 1975, the National Museum of Flight was opened at the airfield, and has since become a popular tourist attraction. It is also home to a Concorde, G-BOAA from the decommissioned British Airways fleet, which forms the centrepiece of a major exhibition about the Concorde programme. At the eastern side of the airfield the old runways and link roads of East Fortune airfield are now used as a motorcycle race track run by the Melville Motorcycle Club. There are around seven race weekends every year with racing on both Saturdays and Sundays, continually attracting over 200 competitors over the several classes available. Riders travel from the local area, Northumberland and as far as Ireland on occasions for most weekends. Melville Motorcycle Club run the track on a not-for-profit basis and have reinvested heavily in resurfacing and upgrading facilities. From 2014, the track also hosts a Greenpower race. At the western side of the airfield East of Scotland Microlights operate from the extension to the main runway that was laid in 1961 when the airfield was used as Edinburgh's Airport. An annual airshow is held, normally in July, however no aircraft are able to land during the airshow due to the runways being in an unfit state for aircraft operations.

The first known example of double-effect reasoning is Thomas Aquinas' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work Summa Theologica.Summa Theologiae, IIa- IIae Q. 64, art. 7 This set of criteria states that an action having foreseen harmful effects practically inseparable from the good effect is justifiable if the following are true: * the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral; * the agent intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect either as a means to the good or as an end in itself; * the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect and the agent exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.T. A. Cavanaugh, Double-Effect Reasoning: Doing Good and Avoiding Evil, p.36, Oxford: Clarendon Press Intentional harm versus side effects The principle of double effect is based on the idea that there is a morally relevant difference between an \\"intended\\" consequence of an act and one that is foreseen by the actor but not calculated to achieve his motive. So, for example, the principle is invoked to consider the terror bombing of non- combatants having as its goal victory in a legitimate war morally out of bounds, while holding as ethically in bounds an act of strategic bombing that similarly harms non-combatants with foresight as a side effect of destroying a legitimate military target. Because advocates of double effect propose that consequentially similar acts can be morally different, double effect is most often criticized by consequentialists who consider the consequences of actions entirely determinative of the action's morality. In their use of the distinction between intent and foresight without intent, advocates of double effect make three arguments. First, that intent differs from foresight, even in cases in which one foresees an effect as inevitable. Second, that one can apply the distinction to specific sets of cases found in military ethics (terror bombing/strategic bombing), medical ethics (craniotomy/hysterectomy), and social ethics (euthanasia). Third, that the distinction has moral relevance, importance, or significance. The doctrine consists of four conditions that must be satisfied before an act is morally permissible: # The nature-of-the-act condition. The action, apart from the foreseen evil, must be either morally good or indifferent. # The means-end condition. The bad effect must not be the means by which one achieves the good effect. Good ends do not justify evil means.Mark Timmons, Moral Theory: An Introduction (Rowman & Littlefield 2003 ), p. 80 # The right-intention condition. The intention must be the achieving of only the good effect, with the bad effect being only an unintended side effect. All reasonable measures to avoid or mitigate the bad effect must be taken. # The proportionality condition. There must be a proportionately grave reason for permitting the evil effect. Examples =Medicine= The principle of double effect is frequently cited in cases of pregnancy and abortion. A doctor who believes abortion is always morally wrong may still remove the uterus or fallopian tubes of a pregnant woman, knowing the procedure will cause the death of the embryo or fetus, in cases in which the woman is certain to die without the procedure (examples cited include aggressive uterine cancer and ectopic pregnancy). In these cases, the intended effect is to save the woman's life, not to terminate the pregnancy, and the effect of not performing the procedure would result in the greater evil of the death of both the mother and the fetus. In cases of terminally ill patients who would hasten their deaths because of unbearable pain, or whose caregivers would do so for them (euthanasia, medical aid in dying, etc.), a principle of \\"double effect death\\" could be applied to justify the deliberate administration of a pain-killer in potentially unsafe doses‚Äînot in an attempt to end life but to relieve the pain suffered as it is considered harmful to the patient. The U.S. Supreme Court has voiced support for this principle in its deliberations over the constitutionality of medical aid in dying.Vacco v. Quill and Washington v. Glucksberg, both in 1997. See: Tucker, Kathryn E., ‚ÄúLegal Advocacy to Improved Care and Expand Options at the End of Life,‚Äù in Physician-Assisted Dying: The Case for Palliative Care & Patient Choice, edited by T.E. Quill and M.P. Battin (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004). The Court made it clear that a ‚Äúmedical death‚Äù hastened by palliative measures was permissible. Criticisms Consequentialists, in particular, reject the notion that two acts can differ in their moral permissibility if both have exactly the same consequences, or expected consequences. John Stuart Mill, a nineteenth-century advocate of the utilitarian version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: \\"He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations.\\" According to Mill, scrutiny of motives will show that almost all good behavior proceeds from questionable intentions. Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and unintended consequences.John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism (London: Parker, Son and Bourn, 1863), page 26. Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions.

Indigenous Peoples, the Irish, British, and the French have all made unique contributions to the musical heritage of Canada. The music has subsequently been heavily influenced by American culture because of the proximity and migration between the two countries. Since French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1605 and established the first permanent Canadian settlements at Port Royal and Qu√©bec in 1608, the country has produced its own composers, musicians and ensembles. Canada's music industry is the sixth largest in the world, producing many internationally renowned artists. Canada has developed a music infrastructure, that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations and television music video channels. Canada's music broadcasting is regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences administers Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards, which first commenced in 1970. History =Indigenous music= For thousands of years, Canada has been inhabited by indigenous peoples from a variety of different cultures and of several major linguistic groupings. Each of the Indigenous communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. Chanting - singing is widely popular, with many of its performers also using a variety of musical instruments. They used the materials at hand to make their instruments for thousands of years before Europeans immigrated to the new world. They made gourds and animal horns into rattles which were elaborately carved and beautifully painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birchbark along with drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs and dances. For many years after European settlement Canada, First Nations and Inuit peoples were discouraged from practicing their traditional ceremonies. However, impacts varied significantly depending on such aspects as the time period, relative population size, relation quality, resistance, etc. In 1606‚Äì1607 Marc Lescarbot collected the earliest extant transcriptions of songs from the Americas: three songs of Henri Membertou, the sakmow (Grand Chief) of the Mi'kmaq First Nations tribe situated near Port Royal, present-day Nova Scotia. =17th century= Louis Jolliet - sculpture at the Quebec Parliament. French settlers and explorers to New France brought with them a great love of song, dance and fiddle playing. Beginning in the 1630s French and Indigenous children at Qu√©bec were taught to sing and play European instruments, like viols, violins, guitars, transverse flutes, drums, fifes and trumpets. Ecole des Ursulines and The Ursuline Convent are among North America's oldest schools and the first institutions of learning for women in North America. Both were founded in 1639 by French nun Marie of the Incarnation (1599‚Äì1672) alongside the laywoman Marie-Madeline de Chauvigny de la Peltrie (1603‚Äì1671) and are the first Canadian institutions to have music as part of the curriculum.New Catholic encyclopedia. editors, Thomas Carson, Joann Cerrito - Washington, D.C.

Louis Jolliet (1645‚Äì1700) is on record as one of the first classically trained practicing musicians in New France, although history has recognized him more as an explorer, hydrographer and voyageur. Jolliet is said to have played the organ, harpsichord, flute, and trumpet. In 1700, under British rule at this time, an organ was installed in Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal and military bands gave concerts on the Champ de Mars. A French-born priest, Ren√© M√©nard, composed motets around 1640, and a second Canadian-born priest, Charles-Amador Martin, is credited with the plainchant music for the Sacrae familiae felix spectaculum, in celebration of the Holy Family feast day in 1700. =18th century= Joseph Quesnel (1746‚Äì1809) Historically, music was composed in Canada's colonies and settlements during the 18th century, although very few popular named works have survived or were even published. The French and Indian Wars began and left the population economically drained and ill-equipped to develop cultural pursuits properly. The part-time composers of this period were nonetheless often quite skilled. Traditional songs and dances, such as those of the Habitants and M√©tis, were transmitted orally, from generation to generation and from village to village, thus people felt no need to transcribe or publish them.Contemporary Canadian Composers. ed. by Keith MacMillan and John Beckwith.

Canada's first two operas were written, ca. 1790 and ca. 1808 by composer, poet, and playwright Joseph Quesnel (1746‚Äì1809). The instrument of favour for the lower class was the fiddle. Fiddlers were a fixture in most public drinking establishments. God Save the King/Queen has been sung in Canada since British rule and by the mid-20th century was, along with \\"O Canada\\", one of the country's two de facto national anthems. =19th century= The beginning of the 19th century Canadian musical ensembles had started forming in great numbers, writing waltzes, quadrilles, polkas and galops. The first volumes of music printed in Canada was the \\"Graduel romain\\" in 1800 followed by the \\"Union Harmony\\" in 1801. Folk music was still thriving, as recounted in the poem titled \\"A Canadian Boat Song\\". The poem was composed by the Irish poet Thomas Moore (1779‚Äì1852) during a visit to Canada in 1804. \\"The Canadian Boat Song\\" was so popular that it was published several times over the next forty years in Boston, New York City and Philadelphia. Dancing likewise was an extremely popular form of entertainment as noted In 1807 by the Scottish traveler and artist George Heriot (1759‚Äì1839), who wrote... Temple of the Children of Peace, where the band played from the second floor. Among the earliest musical societies were Halifax's \\"New Union Singing Society\\" of 1809 and Qu√©bec's \\"Harmonic Society\\" of 1820. One of the first registered all-civilian musical ensembles was a religious sect organized from Upper Canada called the Children of Peace in 1820. In 1833, a student orchestra was organized at the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec the Soci√©t√© Ste-C√©cile, as it was known, and was one of the earliest ensembles of its kind in Lower Canada. The first appearance of a piece of music in a newspaper or magazine was in the pages of the Montreal twice-weekly newspaper, La Minerve, on September 19, 1831. Many immigrants during this time lived in relative isolation and music sometimes obtained through subscriptions to newspapers and magazines, provided entertainment and a life line to civilization. One of the earliest surviving publications in Canada of a song on the piano in sheet music format is \\"The Merry Bells of England\\" by J.F. Lehmann, of Bytown (later Ottawa) in 1840. Alexander Muir (1830‚Äì1906) The Great Migration of Canada from 1815 to 1850, consisting largely of Irish, and British immigrants, broadened considerably the Canadian musical culture. 1844, Samuel Nordheimer (1824‚Äì1912) opened a music store in Toronto selling pianos and soon thereafter began to publish engraved sheet music.

By the time of Canadian Confederation (1867), songwriting had become a favored means of personal expression across the land. In a society in which most middle-class families now owned a harmonium or piano, and standard education included at least the rudiments of music, the result was often an original song.The Piano Concerto In Canada, 1900‚Äì1980 a bibliographic survey. by Zuk, Ireneus.

The 1870s saw several conservatories open their doors, providing their string, woodwind and brass faculty, leading to the opportunity for any class level of society to learn music. One Sweetly Solemn Thought in 1876 by Hamilton-based Robert S. Ambrose, became one of the most popular songs to ever be published in the 19th century. It fulfilled the purpose of being an appropriate song to sing in the parlors of homes that would not permit any non-sacred music to be performed on Sundays. At the same time it could be sung in dance halls or on the stage along with selections from operas and operettas. Calixa Lavall√©e, (1842‚Äì1891) \\"O Canada\\" was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Th√©odore Robitaille (1834‚Äì1897), for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony. Calixa Lavall√©e (1842‚Äì1891) wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier (1839‚Äì1920). The text was originally only in French, before it was translated into English from 1906 on. Leo, the Royal Cadet a light opera with music by Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and a libretto by George Frederick Cameron was composed in Kingston, Ontario in 1889. The work centres on Nellie's love for Leo, a cadet at the Royal Military College of Canada who becomes a hero serving during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. The operetta focussed on typical character types, events and concerns of Telgmann and Cameron's time and place. =20th century=  1900‚Äì1929  R. Nathaniel Dett (1882‚Äì1943) Prior to the development of the gramophone, Canadian songwriters' works were published as sheet music, or in periodicals in local newspapers such as The Montreal Gazette and Toronto Empire. Most recordings purchased by Canadians in the early days of the gramophone were made by American and British performers, behind some of these international hits were Canadian songwriters.Music in Canada, capturing landscape and diversity by Elaine Keillor. Montreal McGill-Queen's University Press. 1939 () Robert Nathaniel Dett (1882‚Äì1943) was among the first Black Canadian composers during the early years of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. His works often appeared among the programs of William Marion Cook's New York syncopated Orchestra. Dett himself performed at Carnegie Hall and at the Boston Symphony Hall as a pianist and choir director.Southern, Eileen. The Music of Black Americans: A History. W. W. Norton & Company; 3rd edition. () Following quickly on the gramophone's spread came Canada's involvement in the First World War. The war was the catalyst for the writing and recording of large numbers of Canadian-written popular songs, some of which achieved lasting international commercial success. The military during World War I produced official music such as regimental marches and songs as well as utilitarian bugle calls. The soldiers had a repertoire of their own, largely consisting of new, often ribald, lyrics to older tunes. Murray Adaskin, (1906‚Äì2002) Canada's first independent record label Compo Company built a pressing plant (the largest of its day) in 1918 at Lachine, Quebec. Compo was originally created to serve the several American independent record companies such as Okeh Records which wanted to distribute records in Canada. The 1920s saw Canada's first radio stations, this allowed Canadian songwriters to contribute some of the most famous popular music of the early 20th century. Canada's first commercial radio station CFCF (formerly XWA) begins broadcasting regularly scheduled programming in Montreal in 1920, followed by CKAC, Canada's first French language radio station, in 1922. By 1923, there were 34 radio stations in Canada and subsequently proliferated at a remarkable rate, and with them spread the popularity of jazz. Jazz became associated with all things modern, sophisticated, and also decadent.Hakim, Joy (1995). War, Peace, and All That Jazz. New York, New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 41‚Äì46. () In 1925, the Canadian Performing Rights Society was formed to administer public performance and royalties for composers and lyricists. It became known as the Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada (CAPAC). Toronto-born Murray Adaskin (1906‚Äì2002) was a violinist, composer, conductor and teacher at the University of Saskatchewan. From 1923 to 1936 he was an orchestral and chamber musician with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, he was later named head of music at the University of Saskatchewan.

Canada's first big band star was Guy Lombardo (1902‚Äì1977), who formed his easy listening band, The Royal Canadians, with his brothers and friends. They achieved international success starting in the mid-1920s selling an estimated 250 million phonograph records, and were the first Canadians to have a #1 single on Billboards top 100. 1932, the first Broadcasting Act was passed by Parliament creating the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission. It was to both to regulate all broadcasting and create a new national public radio network. 1936, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation came into existence, at the time, a million Canadian households had a radio. Emerging out of the great depression on near equal-footing to American popular music, Canadian popular music continued to enjoy considerable success at home and abroad in the preceding years.Before the gold rush: flashbacks to the dawn of the Canadian sound by Nicholas Jennings, (Yorkville ON: Viking, 1997) ()Canadian music fast facts: profiles of Canada's pop music pioneers. by Randy Ray and Mark Kearney London, Ont. : Sparky Jefferson Productions, c1991.

Don Mills, Ont. : Society of Composers, Authors and Music publishers of Canada, 1994- (ML27 .C3S635) Most notable from the 1940s is contralto singer Portia White (1911‚Äì1968). She achieved international fame because of her voice and stage presence. As a Canadian female of African descent, her popularity helped to open previously- closed doors for talented women who followed. She has been declared \\"A person of national historic significance\\" by the Government of Canada. In 1964 she performed for Queen Elizabeth II, at the opening of the Confederation Centre of the Arts. Paul Anka, 2007 Following World War II a growth phase for Canadian bands was experienced, this time among school bands. Rapid advances in the inclusion of instrumental music study in formal school curricula brought about fundamental changes to the philosophy of the band movement and the type of repertoire available. The CHUM Chart debuted on May 27, 1957, under the name CHUM's Weekly Hit Parade, was in response to the fast-growing diversity of music that needed to be subdivided and categorized.Music Directory of Canada. 8th ed. Toronto : Norris-Whitney, 2001 The CHUM charts were the longest-running Top 40 chart in Canada ending in 1986. 1958 saw its first Canadian rock and roll teen idol Paul Anka, who went to New York City where he auditioned for ABC with the song \\"Diana\\".Canadian musician periodical. Unionville Branch v. 20 no. 4, 1998 August (ISSN 0708-9635) This song brought Anka instant stardom as it reached number one on the US Billboard charts. \\"Diana\\" has gone on to be one of the best selling 45s in music history.

Canada would produce some of the world's most influential singer-songwriters during this time. Among the most notable is Winnipeg's Neil Young who has been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Canada's Walk of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. Leonard Cohen has been inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame and is also a Companion of the Order of Canada. Folk legend Joni Mitchell is an Alberta native, and has been inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Walt Grealis of Toronto started in the music business with Apex Records in 1960, the Ontario distributor for Compo Company. He later joined London Records, where he worked until February 1964, when he then established RPM weekly trade magazine. From the first issue of RPM Weekly on February 24, 1964 to its final issue on November 13, 2000, RPM was the defining charts in Canada. The American and British counterculture explosion and hippie movement had diverted music to that which was dominated by socially and American politically incisive lyrics by the late 1960s.San Francisco Chronicle, 18 January 1967 column, p. 27 The music was an attempt to reflect upon the events of the time ‚Äì civil rights, the war in Vietnam and the rise of feminism.Axes, Chops & Hot Licks: the Canadian rock music scene by Ritchie York, (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1971, 1979) () This led to the Canadian government passing Canadian content legislation to help Canadian artists. On January 18, 1971 regulations came into force requiring AM radio stations to devote 30 per cent of their musical selections to Canadian content. Although this was (and still is) controversial, it quite clearly contributed to the development of a nascent Canadian pop star system. Rush, 2004 With the introduction in the mid-1970s of mainstream music on FM radio stations, where it was common practice to program extended performances, musicians were no longer limited to songs of three minutes' duration as dictated by AM stations for decades. The most notable musicians to benefit from this and one of the largest Canadian exports is the progressive rock band, Rush. Rush have produced 25 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records, making them one of the best-selling ensembles in history, and on April 18, 2013, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In the classical world, homegrown talent Canadian Brass was established in Toronto in 1970‚Äîthey are credited with reshaping concert presentation style for classical artists, now copied and valued everywhere in the classical world. Canada's first nationwide music awards began as a reader poll conducted by Canadian music industry trade magazine RPM Weekly in December 1964. A similar balloting process continued until 1970 when the RPM Gold Leaf Awards, as they were then known, were changed to the Juno Awards. The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences held the first Juno Award ceremony in 1975. This was in response to rectifying the same concerns about promotion of Canadian artists that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission had.230x230px Canadian music changed course in the 1980s and 1990s, the changing fast-paced culture was accompanied by an explosion in youth culture.Heart of Gold: 30 years of Canadian pop music by Martin Melhuish, (Toronto: CBC Enterprises, 1983) ( Until the mid-1960s, little attention was paid to music by Canadian daily newspapers except as news or novelty. With the introduction during the late 1970s of the \\"music critic\\", coverage began to rival that of any other topic.

Like Shania Twain, Alanis Morissette and most notable is French-Canadian singer, Celine Dion, who became Canada's best-selling music artist, and who, in 2004, received the Chopard Diamond Award from the World Music Awards for surpassing 175 million in album sales, worldwide. =21st century= Michael Bubl√© in February 2011 The turn of the millennium was a time of incredible nationalism, at least as far as Canadian radio is concerned. The 1971 CRTC rules (30% Canadian content on Canadian radio) finally come into full effect and by the end of the 20th century radio stations would have to play 35% Canadian content. This led to an explosion in the 21st century of Canadian pop musicians dominating the airwaves unlike any era before. In 1996, VideoFACT launched PromoFACT, a funding program to help new artists produce electronic press kits and websites. At about the same time, the CD (cheap to manufacture) replaced the vinyl album and Compact Cassette (expensive to manufacture). Shortly thereafter, the Internet allowed musicians to directly distribute their music, thus bypassing the selection of the old-fashioned \\"record label\\". Canada's mainstream music industry has suffered as a result of the internet and the boom of independent music. The drop in annual sales between 1999 - the year that Napster's unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing service launched \\\\- and the end of 2004 was $465 million. Drake performing at the Summer Sixteen Tour in Toronto in 2016 In 2007, Canada joined the controversial Anti- Counterfeiting Trade Agreement talks, whose outcome will have a significant impact on the Canadian music industry. In 2010 Canada introduced new copyright legislation. The amended law makes hacking digital locks illegal, but enshrine into law the ability of purchasers to record and copy music from a CD to portable devices. The early 2000s saw Canadian independent artists continue to expand their audience into the United States and beyond. Mainstream Canadian artists with global recorded contracts such as Nelly Furtado, Avril Lavigne, Michael Bubl√©, Drake, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes and Justin Bieber reached new heights in terms of international success, while dominating the American music charts.

Accolades Shania Twain holding her 2011 Juno Award The Canadian Music Hall of Fame established in 1976 honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements. The ceremony is held each year as part of Canada's main annual music industry awards, the Juno Awards. The Governor General's Performing Arts Awards for Lifetime Artistic Achievement are the foremost honours presented for excellence in the performing arts, in the categories of dance, classical music, popular music, film, and radio and television broadcasting. They were initiated in 1992 by then Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn, and winners receive $25,000 and a medal struck by the Royal Canadian Mint.

The most common type of phonetic transcription uses a phonetic alphabet, such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. Versus orthography The pronunciation of words in all languages changes over time. However, their written forms (orthography) are often not modified to take account of such changes, and do not accurately represent the pronunciation. Pronunciation can also vary greatly among dialects of a language. Standard orthography in some languages, such as English and Tibetan, is often irregular and makes it difficult to predict pronunciation from spelling. For example, the words bough and through do not rhyme in English even though their spellings might suggest otherwise. Other languages, such as Spanish and Italian have a more consistent (but still imperfect) relationship between orthography and pronunciation, while a few languages may claim to have a fully phonemic spelling system (a phonemic orthography). For most languages, phonetic transcription makes it possible to show pronunciation with something much nearer to a one-to-one relationship between sound and symbol than is possible with the language's orthography. Phonetic transcription allows one to step outside orthography, examine differences in pronunciation between dialects within a given language and identify changes in pronunciation that may take place over time. A basic principle of phonetic transcription is that it should be applicable to all languages, and its symbols should denote the same phonetic properties whatever the language being transcribed. It follows that a transcription devised for one individual language or group of languages is not a phonetic transcription but an orthography. Narrow versus broad transcription Phonetic transcription may be used to transcribe the phonemes of a language, or it may go further and specify their precise phonetic realization. In all systems of transcription there is a distinction between broad transcription and narrow transcription. Broad transcription indicates only the most noticeable phonetic features of an utterance, whereas narrow transcription encodes more information about the phonetic characteristics of the allophones in the utterance. The difference between broad and narrow is a continuum, but the difference between phonemic and phonetic transcription is usually treated as a binary distinction. Phonemic transcription is a particular form of broad transcription which disregards all allophonic difference; as the name implies, it is not really a phonetic transcription at all (though at times it may coincide with one), but a representation of phonemic structure. A transcription which includes some allophonic detail but is closely linked to the phonemic structure of an utterance is called an allophonic transcription. The advantage of the narrow transcription is that it can help learners to produce exactly the right sound, and allows linguists to make detailed analyses of language variation. The disadvantage is that a narrow transcription is rarely representative of all speakers of a language. While most Americans, Canadians and Australians would pronounce the of little as a tap , many speakers in southern England would pronounce /t/ as (a glottal stop; t-glottalization) and/or the second as a vowel resembling (L-vocalization), possibly yielding . A further disadvantage of narrow transcription is that it involves a larger number of symbols and diacritics that may be unfamiliar to non-specialists. The advantage of broad transcription is that it usually allows statements to be made which apply across a more diverse language community. It is thus more appropriate for the pronunciation data in foreign language dictionaries, which may discuss phonetic details in the preface but rarely give them for each entry. A rule of thumb in many linguistics contexts is therefore to use a narrow transcription when it is necessary for the point being made, but a broad transcription whenever possible. Types of notational systems Most phonetic transcription is based on the assumption that linguistic sounds are segmentable into discrete units that can be represented by symbols. Many different types of transcription, or \\"notation\\", have been tried out: these may be divided into Alphabetic (which are based on the same principle as that which governs ordinary alphabetic writing, namely that of using one single simple symbol to represent each sound), and Analphabetic (notations which are not alphabetic) which represent each sound by a composite symbol made up of a number of signs put together. =Alphabetic= IPA The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is the most widely used and well-known of present-day phonetic alphabets, and has a long history. It was created in the nineteenth century by European language teachers and linguists. It soon developed beyond its original purpose as a tool of foreign language pedagogy and is now also used extensively as a practical alphabet of phoneticians and linguists. It is found in many dictionaries, where it is used to indicate the pronunciation of words, but most American dictionaries for native English-speakers, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Webster's Third New International Dictionary, avoid phonetic transcription and instead employ respelling systems based on the English alphabet, with diacritical marks over the vowels and stress marks.Landau, Sidney (2001) Dictionaries: The Art and Craft of Lexicography, 2nd ed., p 118. Cambridge University Press. . (See Pronunciation respelling for English for a generic version.) Another commonly encountered alphabetic tradition was originally created by American linguists for the transcription of Native American and European languages, and is still commonly used by linguists of Slavic, Indic, Semitic, Uralic (here known as the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet) and Caucasian languages. This is sometimes labeled the Americanist phonetic alphabet, but this is misleading because (although it has mostly been used by American or American-trained linguists) it has been widely used for languages outside the Americas. The principal difference between these alphabets and the IPA is that the specially created characters of the IPA are abandoned in favour of already existing typewriter characters with diacritics (e.g. many characters are borrowed from Eastern European orthographies) or digraphs. Examples of this transcription may be seen in Pike's Phonemics and in many of the papers reprinted in Joos's Readings in Linguistics 1. In the days before it was possible to create phonetic fonts for computer printers and computerized typesetting, this system allowed material to be typed on existing typewriters to create printable material. There are also extended versions of the IPA, for example: Ext-IPA, VoQS, and Luciano Canepari's canIPA. Aspects of alphabetic transcription The International Phonetic Association recommends that a phonetic transcription should be enclosed in square brackets \\"[ ]\\". A transcription that specifically denotes only phonological contrasts may be enclosed in slashes \\"/ /\\" instead. If one is unsure, it is best to use brackets since by setting off a transcription with slashes, one makes a theoretical claim that every symbol phonemically contrasts for the language being transcribed. For phonetic transcriptions, there is flexibility in how closely sounds may be transcribed. A transcription that gives only a basic idea of the sounds of a language in the broadest terms is called a broad transcription; in some cases, it may be equivalent to a phonemic transcription (only without any theoretical claims). A close transcription, indicating precise details of the sounds, is called a narrow transcription. They are not binary choices but the ends of a continuum, with many possibilities in between. All are enclosed in brackets. For example, in some dialects the English word pretzel in a narrow transcription would be , which notes several phonetic features that may not be evident even to a native speaker. An example of a broad transcription is , which indicates only some of the features that are easier to hear. A yet broader transcription would be in which every symbol represents an unambiguous speech sound but without going into any unnecessary detail. None of those transcriptions makes any claims about the phonemic status of the sounds. Instead, they represent certain ways in which it is possible to produce the sounds that make up the word. There are also several possibilities in how to transcribe the word phonemically, but here, the differences are generally of not precision but analysis. For example, pretzel could be or . The latter transcription suggests that there are two vowels in the word even if they cannot both be heard, but the former suggests that there is only one. Strictly speaking, it is not possible to have a distinction between \\"broad\\" and \\"narrow\\" within phonemic transcription, since the symbols chosen represent only sounds that have been shown to be distinctive. However, the symbols themselves may be more or less explicit about their phonetic realization. A frequently cited example is the symbol chosen for the English consonant at the beginning of the words 'rue', 'rye', 'red': this is frequently transcribed as /r/, despite the symbol suggesting an association with the IPA symbol [r] which is used for a tongue-tip trill. It is equally possible within a phonemic transcription to use the symbol /…π/, which in IPA usage refers to an alveolar approximant; this is the more common realization for English pronunciation in America and England. Phonemic symbols will frequently be chosen to avoid diacritics as much as possible, under a 'one sound one symbol' policy, or may even be restricted to the ASCII symbols of a typical keyboard, as in the SAMPA alphabet. For example, the English word church may be transcribed as , a close approximation of its actual pronunciation, or more abstractly as , which is easier to type. Phonemic symbols should always be backed up by an explanation of their use and meaning, especially when they are as divergent from actual pronunciation as . Occasionally a transcription will be enclosed in pipes (\\" \\"). This goes beyond phonology into morphological analysis. For example, the words pets and beds could be transcribed phonetically as and (in a fairly narrow transcription), and phonemically as and . Because and are separate phonemes in English, they receive separate symbols in the phonemic analysis. However, a native English speaker would recognize that underneath this, they represent the same plural ending. This can be indicated with the pipe notation. If the plural ending is thought to be essentially an s, as English spelling would suggest, the words can be transcribed  and . If it is essentially a z, these would be  and . To avoid confusion with IPA symbols, it may be desirable to specify when native orthography is being used, so that, for example, the English word jet is not read as \\"yet\\". This is done with angle brackets or chevrons: . It is also common to italicize such words, but the chevrons indicate specifically that they are in the original language's orthography, and not in English transliteration. =Iconic= Visible Speech In iconic phonetic notation, the shapes of the phonetic characters are designed so that they visually represent the position of articulators in the vocal tract. This is unlike alphabetic notation, where the correspondence between character shape and articulator position is arbitrary. This notation is potentially more flexible than alphabetic notation in showing more shades of pronunciation (MacMahon 1996:838‚Äì841). An example of iconic phonetic notation is the Visible Speech system, created by Scottish phonetician Alexander Melville Bell (Ellis 1869:15). =Analphabetic= Another type of phonetic notation that is more precise than alphabetic notation is analphabetic phonetic notation. Instead of both the alphabetic and iconic notational types' general principle of using one symbol per sound, analphabetic notation uses long sequences of symbols to precisely describe the component features of an articulatory gesture (MacMahon 1996:842‚Äì844). This type of notation is reminiscent of the notation used in chemical formulas to denote the composition of chemical compounds. Although more descriptive than alphabetic notation, analphabetic notation is less practical for many purposes (e.g. for descriptive linguists doing fieldwork or for speech pathologists impressionistically transcribing speech disorders). As a result, this type of notation is uncommon. Two examples of this type were developed by the Danish Otto Jespersen (1889) and American Kenneth Pike (1943). Pike's system, which is part of a larger goal of scientific description of phonetics, is particularly interesting in its challenge against the descriptive method of the phoneticians who created alphabetic systems like the IPA. An example of Pike's system can be demonstrated by the following. A syllabic voiced alveolar nasal consonant ( in IPA) is notated as : MaIlDeCVoeIpvnnAPpaatdtltnransnsfSpvavdtlvtnransssfTpgagdtlwvtitvransnsfSrpFSs In Pike's notation there are 5 main components (which are indicated using the example above): # M ‚Äì manner of production (i.e., MaIlDe) # C ‚Äì manner of controlling (i.e., CVoeIpvnn) # description of stricture (i.e., APpaatdtltnransnsfSpvavdtlvtnransssfTpgagdtlwvtitvransnsf) # S ‚Äì segment type (i.e., Srp) # F ‚Äì phonetic function (i.e., FSs) The components of the notational hierarchy of this consonant are explained below: { cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size: 86%\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  : M = productive mechanism :: a = air-stream mechanism ::: I = initiator :::: l = for lung air ::: D = direction of the air stream :::: e = egressive : C = controlling mechanism :: V = valvate stricture ::: o = oral stricture ::: e = subvalvate esophageal stricture :: I = degree of air-stream interruption ::: p = partial (continuants) :::: v = nonfrictional :::: n = nasal ::::: n = resonant nasal  valign=\\"top\\"  : _(Rank of stricture)_ : A = acme : P = primary :: _(Features of stricture)_ :: p = point of articulation ::: a = alveolar :: a = articulator ::: t = tongue tip :: d = degree of articulation ::: t = in time :::: l = long :: t = type of articulation ::: n = normal :: r = relative strength ::: a = of articulating movement :::: n = normal ::: s = of acoustic impression :::: n = normal :: s = shape of articulator ::: f = flat : _(Rank of stricture)_ : S = secondary :: _(Features of stricture)_ :: p = point of articulation ::: v = velic :: a = articulator ::: v = velic :: d = degree of articulation ::: t = in time :::: l = long ::: v = with cavity friction :: t = type of articulation ::: n = normal :: r = relative strength ::: a = of articulating movement :::: n = normal ::: s = of acoustic impression :::: s = soft :: s = shape of articulator ::: f = flat : _(Rank of stricture)_ : T = tertiary :: _(Features of stricture)_ :: p = point of articulation ::: g = glottal :: a = articulator ::: g = vocal folds :: d = degree of articulation ::: t = in time :::: l = long ::: w = wide ::: v = with cavity friction :: t = type of articulation ::: i = iterative :::: t = trill :::: v = vibratory trill :: r = relative strength ::: a = of articulating movement :::: n = normal ::: s = of acoustic impression :::: n = normal :: s = shape of articulator ::: f = flat  valign=\\"top\\"  : S = segmental type :: r = real :: p = perceptual : F = function phonetically :: S = of the segment in the syllable ::: s = syllabic contoid } Bibliography * Albright, Robert W.

Puritan lasted only until 1927, but Paramount, based in the factory of its parent company in Grafton, Wisconsin, published some of the nation's most important early blues recordings between 1929 and 1932. The label's offices were located in Port Washington, Wisconsin and the pressing plant was located at 1819 S. Green Bay Road in Grafton, Wisconsin. The label was managed by Fred Dennett Key. The Wisconsin Chair Company made wooden phonograph cabinets for Edison Records. In 1915 it started making its own phonographs in the name of its subsidiary, the United Phonograph Corporation. It made phonographs under the Vista brand name through the end of the decade; the line failed commercially. In 1918, a line of records debuted on the Paramount label. They were recorded and pressed by a Chair Company subsidiary, the New York Recording Laboratories, Inc. which, despite its name, was located in the same Wisconsin factory in Port Washington. Advertisements, however, stated: \\"Paramounts are recorded in our own New York laboratory\\". In its early years, the Paramount label fared only slightly better than the Vista phonograph line. The product had little to distinguish itself. Paramount released pop recordings with average audio quality pressed on average quality shellac. With the coming of electric recording, both the audio fidelity and the shellac quality declined to well below average, although some Paramount records were well pressed on better shellac and have become collectible. Paramount Records ad, 1919 In the early 1920s, Paramount was accumulating debt while producing no profit. Paramount began offering to press records for other companies on a contract basis at low prices. Race records Paramount was contracted to press discs for Black Swan Records. When the Black Swan company later floundered, Paramount bought out Black Swan and made records by and for African-Americans. These so-called race music records became Paramount's most famous and lucrative business, especially its legendary 12000 series. It is estimated that a quarter of all race records released between 1922 and 1932 were on the Paramount label. Paramount's race record series was launched in 1922 with vaudeville blues songs by Lucille Hegamin and Alberta Hunter. The company had a large mail-order operation which was a key to its early success. Most of Paramount's race music recordings were arranged by black entrepreneur J. Mayo Williams. \\"Ink\\" Williams, as he was known, had no official position with Paramount, but he was given wide latitude to bring African-American talent to the Paramount recording studios and to market Paramount records to African-American consumers. Williams did not know at the time that the \\"race market\\" had become Paramount's prime business and that he was keeping the label afloat. Problems with low fidelity and poor pressings continued. Blind Lemon Jefferson's 1926 hits, \\"Got the Blues\\" and \\"Long Lonesome Blues\\", were quickly rerecorded in the superior facilities of Marsh Laboratories, and subsequent releases used the rerecorded version. Both versions were released on compilation albums. In 1927, Ink Williams moved to competitor Okeh Records, taking Blind Lemon Jefferson with him for just one recording, \\"Matchbox Blues\\". Paramount's recording of the same song can be compared with Okeh's on compilation albums. In 1929, Paramount was building a new studio in Grafton, so it sent Charley Patton --\\"sent up\\" by Jackson, Mississippi, storeowner H. C. Speir --to the studio of Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, where on June 14 he cut 14 famous sides, which led many to consider him the \\"Father of the Delta Blues\\". After Williams quit working for Paramount, he left the business in the hands of his secretary, Aletha Dickerson, who had not been informed that her former employer had quit. Dickerson continued working for Paramount, and eventually moved to the company's new headquarters is Grafton. In 1931, she quit when the management, facing hard times, cut her wages. Depression, closure, reissues The Great Depression drove many record companies out of business. Paramount stopped recording in 1932 and closed in 1935. In 1948 Paramount was bought by John Steiner, who revived the label for reissues of important historical recordings and new recordings of jazz and blues. In 1952 Steiner leased reissue rights to a newly formed jazz label, Riverside Records. Riverside reissued 10\\" and then 12\\" LPs by many blues singers in the Paramount catalog, as well as jazz by such Chicago-based notables as Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band (which included a young Louis Armstrong), Johnny Dodds, Muggsy Spanier, and Meade Lux Lewis. The Riverside label remained active until 1964. The rights to Paramount's back catalog were acquired by George H. Buck in 1970. The use of the name \\"Paramount Records\\" was purchased from Buck by Paramount Pictures, a previously unconnected company. Like other record companies during the Great Depression, Paramount sold most of its master recordings as scrap metal. Some of the company's recordings were said to have been thrown into the Milwaukee River by disgruntled employees when the company was closing in the mid-1930s.Petrusich, Amanda. Do Not Sell At Any Price. Scribner, 2014, p. 78. A 2006 episode of the PBS television show History Detectives showed divers searching the river for Paramount masters and unsold 78s, but they were unsuccessful. Author Amanda Petrusich also dived into the river to find some records for her 2014 book Do Not Sell At Any Price, but did not find any.Petrusich, pg. 111. When Riverside re-released the original recordings, they used records from the collection of John Hammond. John Fahey's Revenant Records and Jack White's Third Man Records issued two volumes of remastered tracks from Paramount's catalog, The Rise and Fall of Paramount Records, Volume One (1917‚Äì27) and The Rise and Fall of Paramount Records, Volume Two (1928‚Äì32), on vinyl records with a USB drive for digital access. Each volume features 800 songs, contemporary ads and images (200 in volume one and 90 in volume 2), two books (a history of Paramount and a guide to the artists and recordings) and six 180-gram vinyl LPs, packaged in a hand-crafted oak case modeled after those that carried phonographs in the 1920s.

Founded in Johannesburg in 1987, Nando's operates over 1,000 outlets in 35 countries. Their logo is the famous Portuguese symbol, the Rooster of Barcelos. History Flame-grilled peri peri chicken at Nando's The restaurant was founded in 1987 in the Johannesburg suburb Rosettenville, by Mozambique-born Fernando Duarte and South African-born Robert Brozin. Upon visiting a Colonial Portuguese-African takeaway named Chickenland, and trying the chicken with peri peri (a sauce that was first developed in nearby Mozambique and further refined in South Africa before being exported to other Portuguese territories and mainland Portugal) they bought the restaurant for about R80,000 rand (equivalent of about ¬£25,000 at the time). They renamed the restaurant Nando's after Fernando's first born son. By 1989, the restaurant had three outlets in Johannesburg and one in Portugal. Capricorn Ventures International acquired the chain in 1992. As of 2017, there were over 1,000 Nando's branches in 35 countries. In 2010, Advertising Age magazine named Nando's one of the world's top 30 hottest marketing brands alongside Tata Nano, MTN and Natura. During the same year, the success of Nando‚Äôs in the U.K. led The Guardian to write that Nando's is a modern restaurant brand that has ‚Äúchanged the face of British fast food‚Äù. In 2012 Nando's 1000th store worldwide opened. As of July 2014 the Nando's restaurant group was ultimately owned by South African businessman Dick Enthoven and his family. Enthoven's son, Robby Enthoven who took over running the restaurants in 1993, was responsible for expanding the Nando's chain in the United Kingdom. In 2018, American-based recruitment website Indeed named Nando's as the UK's sixth best private sector employer based on millions of employee ratings and reviews. Worldwide locations Nando's locations worldwide Nando's has locations in five continents worldwide. =Africa= Nando's take-away in Canal Walk Shopping Mall, Cape Town, South Africa (2006) South Africa Fernando Duarte and his friend Robert Brozin are the founders of the first Nando's restaurant bought a joint previously called \\"ChickenLand\\" and renamed it Nando's.

As of early 2015, they have expanded to a total of 10 outlets in Ireland. United Kingdom Nando's Restaurant at the White Rose Centre in Leeds, West Yorkshire Nando's opened its first UK restaurants in 1992 in the west London suburbs of Ealing and Earls Court, initially focusing on takeaway food. The UK arm, owned by the Enthoven family via a private equity company, struggled until chairman Dick Enthoven put his son Robert in control. The focus then moved from takeaways to a mixed service (counter ordering and table service) model. Nando‚Äôs expanded in the UK in 1993. The company now employs around 8,000 staff in the UK and, as of 2013, had over 280 branches, with some 60 serving food conforming with Muslim dietary laws (halal). In 2010, Nando's UK won the Sunday Times's best place to work award in the big company category. Its sauces and marinades were also retailed in UK supermarkets. Nando's claims to have the largest collection of South African art in the UK, with over 5,000 works displayed in restaurants; original artworks are commissioned by the company. The United Kingdom is one of Nando's largest markets. In March 2020, all 400 UK restaurants closed temporarily due to nationwide lockdown rules introduced by the government to limit the spread of COVID-19. In late April 2020, Nando's reopened select locations for delivery and collection services, with many more locations opening throughout May.

New Zealand Nando's opened their first store in Glenfield in 2000. there are 31 Nando's outlets in New Zealand. Controversies =Advertising= Australian refugee advertisement In Australia, Nando's ran an advertising campaign based around the 2002 political controversy regarding the mandatory detention of refugees. The detainees had been waging a hunger strike campaign, even resorting to sewing their lips closed. Nando's adverts proclaimed that the strikers \\"decided to unsew their lips after hearing the news that with every Nando's quarter chicken combo, Nando's are giving away an extra quarter chicken free\\". Melbourne's Sphere Advertising said that the ad was designed to spark controversy, saying that they knew that \\"there's a section of our audience that's going to be uncomfortable... but we want to evoke a response\\". Malema advertisement During the South African national elections of 2009, Nando's made an advert lampooning African National Congress Youth League then president Julius Malema by using a puppet that resembled him. Malema's lawyers sued Nando's and the original advert was removed. However, an altered version was released, with the puppet's face pixelated and the voice altered. The puppet used in the advert was later sold at auction for R100,000 which was donated to an educational charity. \\"Last dictators\\" advertisement In 2011, Nando's launched a \\"Last dictators\\" advert in South Africa. The 60-second commercial shows a sad Robert Mugabe dining alone at Christmas in a large mansion while he reminisces about \\"happier times\\" with former dictators, such as playing water tag with Muammar Gaddafi, making snow angels in the sand with Saddam Hussein, singing Karaoke with Mao Zedong, pushing P. W. Botha on a swing set, and riding a Covenanter cruiser tank with Idi Amin in a similar fashion to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embracing each other from the film Titanic, while the music from \\"Those Were the Days\\" is played. Musekiwa Kumbula, holder of the Nando's franchise in Zimbabwe, said his group \\"strongly feels the advertisement is insensitive and in poor taste\\". The advert also offended Chipangano, a Zimbabwean youth militia loyal to Mugabe, who then demanded an apology from Nando's, threatened to boycott the South Africa-based chain, and demanded the advert be withdrawn or the restaurant face retribution. Nando's South Africa subsequently withdrew the advert citing threats to its staff in Zimbabwe from a youth group. =Corporation tax bill = Both The Guardian newspaper (UK) and the American non-profit publication ICIJ received documents in July 2014 revealing the details of past and present offshore clients of wealth managers Kleinwort Benson, including the Nando's restaurant group. The Guardian published its belief that, through the use of businesses in Malta, Guernsey and the Netherlands, Enthoven legally reduces the group's UK corporation tax bill by \\"up to a third\\". According to the British newspaper, Enthoven's profits eventually accumulate in the Kleinwort Benson-managed \\"Taro III Trust\\" that is based in Jersey and contains at least ¬£750 million. While no member of the Enthoven family agreed to speak with The Guardian, a company representative explained that UK tax laws are not applicable to Enthoven, as \\"he is not resident in the US or the UK.\\" The spokesperson also stated that, in the UK, Nando's paid corporation tax of ¬£12.6 million on a profit of ¬£58.2 million for the year ending February 2013.

It was founded as a priory in 1139 by William le Gros, the Earl of Yorkshire, and raised to the status of abbey in 1148. It was a house for Augustinian or black canons, who lived a communal life under the Rule of St Augustine but also undertook pastoral duties outside of the Abbey. Officers within the abbey included a cellarer, bursar, chamberlain, sacrist, kitchener and an infirmer. The abbey was closed in 1539 by Henry VIII as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Thornton was a wealthy and prestigious house valued at the dissolution at the considerable sum of ¬£591 0s 2¬æd. It managed to survive by becoming a secular college, until it was closed in 1547. Thornton Abbey railway station is nearby. Architecture The gatehouse of Thornton Abbey from the outside Gatehouse of Thornton Abbey from the inside The founding abbey building from the 12th century was Romanesque in style, but nothing of it remains above ground. The later abbey from the 13th/14th centuries was built in Early Gothic style. Little remains of the building, except for three walls of the chapter house and part of the cloister, though the ground plan of the abbey is traced out. The main interest lies in the gatehouse which is amongst the earliest large-scale uses of brick in England. It stands two storeys high and is structurally intact. There are few windows in the building, and the internal dimensions are cramped due to the thickness of the walls. The outside of the building is adorned with three almost life-size statues directly above the gate. A bridge over the moat adjoins the gatehouse and is fortified with walls and guardrobes. Later history Since the dissolution the site has been owned by: Henry Randes (the Bishop of Lincoln); Sir Robert Tyrwhitt of Kettleby; Sir Vincent Skinner of Westminster (in 1602); Sir Robert Sutton; George Appleby; and in 1816 Charles, 1st Baron Yarborough. In May 1859, members of the Lincoln Diocesan Architectural Society visited the site and were given a guided tour by the Rev. J. Byron of North Killingholme. A report of the tour, published by the Stamford Mercury, records that access to site had been restricted due to damage 'by bands of modern Vandals'. Brass effigies, some in place, others 'strewed amongst the growing grass', and the entrance to a subterranean passageway were also observed. In 1938 Sackville Pelham, 5th Earl of Yarborough handed the care of the abbey remains to HM Office of Works. The site is currently in the care of English Heritage and open to the public. In 2016 excavations directed by Dr Hugh Willmott from the University of Sheffield's Department of Archaeology discovered a Black Death plague pit in the cemetery of the Abbey's hospital. DNA was successfully extracted and tested positive for Yersinia pestis, the bacterium responsible for the plague. The nearby Abbot's Lodge is a Grade I listed building. Elements of the ground floor of the monastic range of Thornton Abbey were converted to a house and the first floor rebuilt in the 17th century, reputedly by Sir Vincent Skinner, but collapsed on completion.

League system In sports using a league system (also known as a pyramid structure), a division consists of a group of teams who play a sport at a similar competitive level. Teams can move up to a higher division of play or drop down to a lower one via the process of promotion and relegation, based on their performance in the standings at the end of the season. The existence of divisions based on level of competition ensures that teams at one competitive level can play other teams at a similar competitive level, thus creating parity and more exciting matches. Franchise system In North America, where sports usually operate on a franchise system rather than a league system, a division is a group of teams within a league which is organized along geographical lines rather than competitive success. Teams based in cities that are in a particular region of the continent are grouped together in the same division. For instance, in Major League Baseball, both the American and National Leagues have East, Central, and West divisions; the teams in each division are mostly (but not always) located in the eastern, central, and western sections of North America respectively. In a franchise system, teams are not promoted or relegated as are teams in a league system. All teams in the league (and by extension, the divisions of the league) are at the same competitive level and remain so year after year. North American professional sports leagues often construct their season schedules in a way such that teams in a division play matches against each other more often than other teams in the league. This not only has the effect of reducing travel costs, but also creates exciting rivalries between the teams in the division. Moreover, the top teams in a division qualify for the postseason playoff tournament that crowns the league champion, which heightens the rivalries between the teams in a division. Geographically-based divisions can become skewed if an expansion team joins the league or if one of the franchises within a division moves to another city, necessitating a shuffling or realignment of the teams in a division. Furthermore, the results of the realignment may not always reflect geographical realities. For instance, in 1995, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL) moved to St Louis, Missouri and became the St Louis Rams. The team retained its place in the NFC West division despite the fact that St. Louis is further east than Dallas, Texas, home of the Dallas Cowboys. Although Dallas is located in the south-central United States, the Cowboys are a member of the NFC East division due to their long-standing rivalries with the New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, and Washington Redskins, all of whom are located on the Eastern seaboard. U.S. college sports In U.S. college sports, a \\"division\\" has a meaning different from either sense listed above, although somewhat closer to that of the league system. The major governing bodies for college sports, the NCAA and NAIA, divide their member schools into large competitive groups. These groups are much larger than divisions in either the league or franchise system‚Äîfor example, the NCAA's highest competitive level, Division I, has more than 300 member schools. The vast majority of teams are members of conferences, smaller groupings that usually have between 6 and 14 members. Conference champions, plus selected other teams, compete in national championship tournaments (with the exception of schools in the highest level of NCAA (American) football, which have never had an NCAA-recognized national championship). As an example, the NCAA is split into three divisions: * Division I ‚Äì Usually the largest and most prominent schools, with the largest athletic budgets. All Division I member schools are allowed to award athletic scholarships to students, although some schools and conferences voluntarily choose not to award athletic scholarships in some or all sports (most notably the Ivy League, which prohibits such scholarships in all sports). * Division II ‚Äì Generally smaller schools that do not choose to take on the sometimes- massive expense of Division I athletics. The NCAA allows D-II schools to award scholarships, but places much more stringent limits on the amount of athletic aid awarded than at the D-I level. * Division III ‚Äì Schools, usually but not always small institutions, at which intercollegiate sports is treated more as a regular student activity. In keeping with this philosophy, the NCAA prohibits Division III schools from awarding athletic scholarships. =\\"Division\\" within conferences= The term division is also used in US college sports to indicate the groupings of members of a given conference. However, this usage is more recent. The first conference to divide its teams into divisions was the Southeastern Conference which, upon expanding to 12 members in 1992, divided into Eastern and Western divisions. Other conferences have undergone similar expansion and division. The usage in the section above is still maintained. For example, the Georgia Bulldogs are in Division I, but are also in the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference.

Its 50th anniversary was celebrated on-air on November 16, 2018. It has been one of the most popular and acclaimed shows on CBC Radio. The bulk of the program consists of one of the co-hosts, currently Carol Off, conducting telephone interviews with newsmakers and other persons of interest. The other co-host, Chris Howden as of January 6, 2020, introduces the interviews and other segments, such as \\"For the Record\\" recordings of speeches or press conferences, and musical interludes (or as former co-host Barbara Budd often referred to them, \\"the dance portion of the program\\"). Stations and time The show is broadcast each weekday from 6:30 to 8:00 p.m. (half an hour later in Newfoundland) throughout Canada. It used to be widely accessible to much of the northern United States, but as the CBC switched its CBC Radio One from powerful AM signals in Eastern Canadian urban centres to FM stations, it became harder to receive CBC content further away from the border. As It Happens can be heard on CBC Radio One's channel 169 on Sirius Satellite Radio (in both Canada and the U.S.), on an increasing number of American public radio stations, especially NPR affiliates with news radio formats, via distribution from CBC's American distribution partner Public Radio International, and on the Internet via streaming audio at the CBC's website. Older broadcasts are available as a stream from the CBC's website, but without the music. As It Happens is heard on a delayed-broadcast basis in the United States, generally airing in a later-evening slot and often paired with Q; American stations that carry As It Happens do not air the final half- hour (7:30 to 8:00 p.m.) of the program. In the fall of 2009, the show also added an hour long repeat airing at midnight Tuesday morning to Friday morning called As It Happens: The Midnight Edition which features selections from the evening broadcast. During the summer, the program ends at 7:30 and is followed by a half-hour program from the network's schedule of short-run summer series. Most summers, one of those summer series is As It Happened: The Archive Edition, a separate program which airs previously broadcast interviews from the main series. History The show was introduced in 1968 as a reverse call-in show: rather than having the public call in, the reporters at As It Happens called newsmakers and pundits for their opinions. During the 1970s, the program produced 54-minute-long segments called \\"As It Happened, (insert year)\\", covering the major events of years past, particularly the 1930s and 1940s. During the CBC technicians strike in 1981, after a few weeks of music, the As It Happened segments were played each weeknight in chronological order as repeat filler material until the strike was resolved. =Hosts= *1968‚Äì1969: Phillip Forsyth, Harry Brown and William Ronald *1969‚Äì1971: Harry Brown and William Ronald *1971‚Äì1973: Barbara Frum, Harry Brown, Cy Strange *1973‚Äì1974: Barbara Frum and Harry Brown *1974‚Äì1981: Barbara Frum and Alan Maitland *1981‚Äì1985: Elizabeth Gray and Alan Maitland *1985‚Äì1987: Dennis Trudeau and Alan Maitland *1987‚Äì1993: Michael Enright and Alan Maitland *1993‚Äì1997: Michael Enright and Barbara Budd *1997‚Äì2005: Mary Lou Finlay and Barbara Budd *2006‚Äì2010: Carol Off and Barbara Budd *2010: Carol Off and guest host *2011‚Äì2019: Carol Off and Jeff Douglas *2019: Carol Off and guest host *2020‚Äì : Carol Off and Chris Howden When the interviewer is absent, other CBC journalists typically sit in as substitute interviewers; when the announcer is absent, substitutes may include other CBC personalities, actors such as R.H.

She was ultimately spared. The show has also interviewed a wide array of presidents, prime ministers, terrorists, inventors, and authors. Humour Despite the gravity of many of its stories, As It Happens is also known for being lighthearted and carrying news of the obscure and bizarre. For instance, during the early 1990s there were updates for several years on the battle over a large fibreglass fish that annoyed a neighbour in England. The show opens with humorous synopses of the day's stories, which are followed by a pun based on one of the same. An example is \\"radio that reads between the Linuses,\\" following a story about baseball stats in the Peanuts comic strip.As It Happens, \\"January 20, 2010\\" As it happens, the show‚Äôs title is also a pun. Former host Barbara Frum once interviewed Cookie Monster from Sesame Street. Another well-remembered interview was with a hard-of-hearing but imperturbable British farmer who had grown a prize-winning giant cabbage. The 1976 interview was conducted by an increasingly frustrated Frum, who could not get the farmer to give any kind of coherent replies to her straightforward questions; by mid- interview, Frum was stuck repeatedly asking the question \\"What did you feed your cabbage?\\" a little bit louder each time. Exasperated, she finally asks him \\"WHAT. DID. YOU. FEED. THE. GODDAMN. CABBAGE?\\". It is still occasionally played as an amusing interlude on the show, as well as on CBC Radio's afternoon series Rewind. After Lloyd Robertson left CBC Television for CTV in 1976, the program conducted its own on-air auditions for his replacement as anchor of The National, eventually choosing Robert Stanfield as its nominee. Barbara Budd and Mary Lou Finlay maintained a recurring debate over whether ABBA's \\"Dancing Queen\\" was an appropriate choice of bumper music between interviews, and more recently Budd and Carol Off solicited listener feedback to determine the world's most annoying song. On one occasion when Budd was away on a sick leave that coincided with April Fools' Day, she and Finlay arranged a prank in which Budd gave an interview explaining that she had been given a Canada Council grant to tour the world visiting all the cities whose names she had ever mispronounced on the air.As It Happens: Tribute to Barbara Budd, April 30, 2010. Following Finlay's retirement in 2005, she published The As It Happens Files, a memoir of her time with the program. The book was subtitled Radio That May Contain Nuts. =The distance from Reading= A frequently cited example of the show's sometimes whimsical sense of humour relates to its frequent references to the UK town of Reading, Berkshire. After almost any lighter news story or interview that emanates from any location in the UK, the As It Happens host will conclude the piece by straight-facedly noting how far the UK location is from Reading, frequently giving the distance in both miles and some other form of strange, non-standard measurement (e.g., 733,000 garden gnomes, lined up hat to hat). This long-standing tradition on the show dates from the mid-1970s, when English-born segment producer George Somerwill once concluded a program script with a note that a small village mentioned in the preceding segment was located 'nine miles from Reading'.Mary Lou Finlay, The As It Happens Files, Alfred A. Knopf, Toronto, 2008, pp 34-35. This note, intended as a serious clarification, was totally baffling to most Canadian listeners‚Äîand even to the rest of the show's staff. It quickly became a running joke on the show to identify all places in the UK (even major centres like London) in relation to their proximity to the comparatively obscure borough of Reading. In her book The As It Happens Files, former show host Mary Lou Finlay notes that As It Happens has given a boost not just to Reading's profile, but also to its economy, as in recent years a number of Canadian fans of the show have made a point of visiting Reading when they are visiting the UK. Christmas and Hanukkah readings During the holiday season in late November and December each year, the show also maintains a tradition of airing one or more Christmas and Hanukkah themed stories narrated by past or present announcers. Alan Maitland's reading of Frederick Forsyth's The Shepherd is always played on the last show before Christmas Day, and Maitland's reading of O. Henry's \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" remains a popular staple of the program, as do Barbara Budd's narrations of How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and Aubrey Davis' Bone Button Borscht. Music The opening and closing themes ‚Äî \\"Curried Soul\\" and \\"Koff Drops\\", respectively ‚Äî are played by Moe Koffman. The second segment of the show begins with a 1987 rearrangement of \\"Curried Soul\\" by Billy Bryans. In September 2013, amidst much on-air fanfare, the decades-old \\"Curried Soul\\" opening theme was given a discreetly modernized remix by Socalled.\\"As It Happens 'Curried Soul' theme remixer Socalled on how to remix a classic\\" . CBC Music, September 4, 2013. During phone-in segments broadcast in the days following the new theme's premiere, listener reaction was mixed: some preferred the newer mix, while others stated their preference for the original 1969 recording. When Socalled appeared on CBC Radio's Q as a musical guest in June 2015, Off and Douglas joined him for a live performance of the song, with Douglas playing a shaker and Off playing cowbell. On extraordinary news occasions, the show may also broadcast alternate opening and closing theme music more reflective of a major news story, or may entirely skip opening theme music. For example, on the December 5, 2013 episode marking the death of Nelson Mandela, the show opened and closed with Ladysmith Black Mambazo's recording of \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\"; on the October 22, 2014 episode covering the Parliament Hill shootings, the show opened with a montage of audio clips of the day's events, entirely skipping theme music; and on the November 11, 2016 episode following the death of Canadian musical and literary icon Leonard Cohen, the show opened with Cohen's \\"Bird on the Wire\\".

History The Vienna School of Fantastic Realism, first established in 1946, is considered to be an important technical and philosophical catalyst in its strong influence upon contemporary visionary art.Manifesto of Visionary Art by L. Caruana Its artists included Ernst Fuchs, Rudolf Hausner, Arik Brauer, Wolfgang Hutter and Anton Lehmden among others. Several artists who would later work in visionary art trained under Fuchs, including Mati Klarwein, Robert Venosa,Robert Venosa biography Philip Rubinov Jacobson and De Es Schwertberger. Definition Visionary artist Laurence Caruana with visionary art paintings. Visionary art often carries themes of spiritual, mystical or inner awareness. Despite this broad definition, there does seem to be emerging some definition to what constitutes the contemporary visionary art 'scene' and which artists can be considered especially influential. Symbolism, Cubism, Surrealism and Psychedelic art are also direct precursors to contemporary visionary art. Notable visionary artists count Hilma af Klint, Hieronymous Bosch, William Blake, Morris Graves (of the Pacific Northwest School of Visionary Art), Emil Bisttram, and Gustave Moreau amongst their antecedents. Schools and organizations The Vienna School of Fantastic Realism, which includes Ernst Fuchs and Arik Brauer, is also a strong influence on visionary culture. It may also be considered the European version, with the names being interchangeable. The Society for the Art of Imagination, founded by Brigid Marlin serves as an important portal for visionary art events. More recently, a new wave of visionary artists collaborate to function as modern cooperatives involved in self-publishing and promotion of visionary artists through the internet and via festivals such as Burning Man and Boom Festival, and exhibition/ritual spaces such as Tribe 13, Temple of Visions, Psychedelic Dream Temple, Synergenesis and the Interdimensional Art Movement. =Organizations= *Society for Art of Imagination *Society of Layerists in MultiMedia *The VANA (visionary art film) project *Chapel of Sacred Mirrors Gallery File:Alex Grey Painting 4 cropped.jpgA painting by Alex Grey File:Templi dell'Umanit√† Damanhur.jpgHall of Mirrors, Temples of Humankind, Federation of Damanhur See also *Burning Man *Interdimensional art *Fantastic art *Horror vacui *Outsider art *Psychedelic art *Surrealism *Alex Grey *The Symbolist and Decadent art movement *Temples of Humankind *Conceptual art References =Sources= * Cosmic Art Ramond & Lila Piper (Hawthorne Books) , 1975 * Celestial Visitations The Art of Gilbert Williams (Pomegranate Artbooks) , 1979 * Sacred Mirrors: The Visionary Art of Alex Grey\\", Carlo McCormick, Inner Traditions International, 1990 * Raw Creation: Outsider Art and Beyond John Maizels,, 1996 * The Art of Adolf Wolfli Elka Spoerri, Daniel Baumann and E.

Most car artists are ordinary people with no artistic training.\\"'Art cars' find a lane on the main drag: Quirky creations gaining popularity.\\" USA Today. 16 Sep. 2003. 7D. Web. Academic Search Premier. Artists are largely self-taught and self funded, though some mainstream trained artists have also worked in the art car medium. Most others agree that creating and driving an art car daily is its own reward. Artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and others have designed BMW Art Cars and their work has been reflected in racing cars like the BMW V12 LMR.Art car festival in San Francisco \\"Animal print\\" art car Leopard Bernstein, with owner/creator Kelly Lyles dressed in matching motif. History There is some disagreement as to what precisely led to the growth of the art car subculture. It can be seen as a twining together of several influences - the hippie-themed VWs of the late 1960s, the lowrider, as well as a Merry Pranksters' creation, the decorated school bus known as Furthur. During the late 1960s, singer Janis Joplin had a psychedelically-painted Porsche 356 and John Lennon, a paisley Rolls Royce.https://web.archive.org/web/20051127032512/http://www.officialjanis.com/porsche.html Partly in imitation, the late 1960s/early 1970s counterculture featured many painted VW Buses (sometimes with a peace symbol in place of the giant VW logo) and customized vehicles (e.g. a customized 1977 Cadillac Fleetwood seen in the film Escape from New York). Likewise, as a way of evading The Muppet Movie's main antagonist \\"Doc Hopper\\", Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem paint up the borrowed 1951 \\"bullet-nose\\" Studebaker Commander two-door owned by Fozzie Bear's uncle in a psychedelic manner, for Fozzie and Kermit the Frog to escape safely, at least for a while.Fozzie in his psychedelic \\"art-car\\" Studebaker from The Muppet Movie Artist Larry Fuente was among the first to take motorized appliqu√© to the limit with his \\"Mad Cad.\\" Later, artists Jackie Harris and David Best contributed their works to the art car world. An example of an art car event - cars gathered in Providence, RI at the Rhode Rally 2000 An art car community began to cohere in the 1990s, inspired by movies and books with a wide underground following, and the development of innovative art display venues such as Burning Man. One of the main forces behind this is filmmaker and art car artist Harrod Blank, who created the art car documentaries Wild Wheels (1992), Driving The Dream (1998) and Automorphosis (2009). He also published two books Wild Wheels (1993, 2001) and Art Cars: the cars, the artists, the obsession, the craft (2002, 2007, 2012) Blank also co- founded with Philo Northrup the U.S.'s second largest art car festival in the San Francisco Bay Area: ArtCar Fest. Today many cars are covered by local newspapers and media. The only real way to get an idea of what is out there is to simply hit the road or attend an art car event. A New Year's Eve event in Houston, Texas, held on 31 December 2010 had over 100 Illuminated entrants, it is titled Gloworama, produced by ArtX (formerly Art Cars of Houston LLC prior to 2013 - their events are limited to illuminated vehicles only). The illuminated parade also drew the attention of the Galveston, Texas-based business empire Yaga's Entertainment, Inc. (the contract holder of Mardi Gras! Galveston 2011-2015) as part of their five-year contract signed on 18 November 2010. A well known early art car used for commercial advertisement was the Oscar Mayer Wienie Wagon‚ÄîLater versions were known as the Wienermobile. These are bus-sized vehicles styled to appear as a hot dog on a bun. Commercial use of the art car has become popular in the 20th and continues into the 21st century. At the same time visionary applications including cars transformed into religious shrines continues to place visionary self-taught artists, student artists and corporate artists side by side on the road and at art car events. The art car culture was once strongest throughout Texas and the Southeast but now it extends throughout the United States and art car events can be found in many major cities as well as in small country towns. Art cars now very evident in the East, with a large event often held in Baltimore. In Canada, art cars are popular in British Columbia and also in the western Canadian plains with shows in Nanaimo, British Columbia and Regina, Saskatchewan. Other cars can be found throughout the world, most recently in Europe with the European arm of car-hire firm Avis supporting the movement. Artistic styles Huichol style Art cars are public and mobile expressions of the artistic need to create. Often these days art cars derive their inspiration from popular culture. Others however, are created by visionary artists in order to express complex visions, philosophies and ideas. There is a wide and varied spectrum of purpose found in art cars. In creating an art car, the \\"exteriors and interiors of factory-made automobiles are transformed into expressions of individual ideas, values, beliefs and dreams. The cars range from imaginatively painted vehicles to extravagant fantasies whose original bodies are concealed beneath newly sculptured shells\\".Petersen Automotive Museum's Spring 2003 Los Angeles, California exhibit Wild Wheels: Art for the Road Gallery Guide An example of an art car with a message meant to educate Later themes have become more widely focused and more satirical or dark. One of the funniest and most inventive entries in recent memory was titled \\"Student Driver:\\" it featured a telephone pole laminated through one corner of the cabin; a leg with roller skate still attached projecting from one wheel well; and sundry jokey dents and marks of mayhem all over the vehicle. Political or educational messages are incorporated when an artist realizes that they can take advantage of the attention they garner to advance a cause. Science fiction themes (monsters, giant insects from Them!, flying saucers) are common crowd pleasers. Expressions of the Gothic and the sublime are not unknown. Surrealism is commonplace. In parades and shows, shtick often includes \\"arted\\" bicycles or motor-scooters or costumed roller-skaters weaving among the art cars. Many art car owners are natural-born hams, and incorporate elements of music or street theater in their presentation. Artistic style must be carefully dove tailed with the constraints of the law. However, the car artist who takes the time to read the rules is generally surprised at how free expression can be (in the United States at least). Although pulled over by police at times the car artist who is fluent in the law will find that the police are glad to be educated as they themselves often do not realize what is possible under the many law codes on the books. For daily driver cartists making sure the art is legal can be a daunting task. For some it is part of the fun.

In 2004, it merged with the G4 gaming channel which ultimately dissolved TechTV programming. At the height of its six-year run, TechTV was broadcast in 70 countries, reached 43 million households, and claimed 1.9 million unique visitors monthly to its website. A focus on personality-driven product reviews and technical support made it a cultural hub for technology information worldwide, still existing today online through its former hosts' webcasts, most notably the TWiT Network. The offices were located at 650 Townsend Street, 94103, and the studios, of which there were two, were located at 535 York Street, 94110. Names It originally was called ZDTV by its founder, Ziff-Davis, when it debuted on May 11, 1998. It later was owned by Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures. Vulcan Ventures sold TechTV to G4 Media (owned primarily by Comcast), which merged it with the video game channel G4 in May 2004 to form G4techTV. In February 2005, the name was changed back to G4, eliminating TechTV from the name completely. Show personalities The personalities of TechTV include Leo Laporte, Kate Botello, Roger Chang, Yoshi DeHerrera, John C. Dvorak, Carmine Gallo, Ali Hossaini, James Kim, Kris Kosach, Pam Krueger, Chris Leary, Chi-Lan Lieu, Jim Louderback, Tom Merritt, Megan Morrone, Patrick Norton, SuChin Pak, Michaela Pereira, Bill Rafferty, Kevin Rose, Martin Sargent, Catherine Schwartz, Adam Sessler, Laura Swisher, Morgan Webb, Tammy Cavadias and Liam Mayclem. Many former hosts of TechTV programs have gone on to create new programs distributed online: Leo Laporte's This Week in Tech, Chris Pirillo's live.pirillo.com, Systm, thebroken, From The Shadows, commandN, Diggnation, Infected with Martin Sargent, DL.TV, CrankyGeeks, InDigital, East Meets West, and Weezy and the Swish are some of the shows produced by alumni. Leo Laporte hosted Call for Help which aired until April 6, 2007. It was revamped and renamed The Lab with Leo Laporte and was shown on G4techTV Canada and the Australian HOW TO Channel. The show was filmed in HD and Laporte hoped to have it picked up by an American network. The series has since been cancelled due to poor ratings. Kevin Rose, who worked on \\"The Screen Savers\\" and \\"Unscrewed with Martin Sargent\\", co-founded Digg which he featured on \\"The Screen Savers\\" in 2004 , was hired by Google in March 2012, along with many of the employees at Rose's mobile app incubator called Milk. =Former personalities= * Peter Barnes, Fox Business Channel * Erica Hill, HLN host * Leo Laporte, Leo Laporte's This Week in Tech, founder of TWiT.tv * Kris Kosach, Host Audiofile * Scott Herriot, Anchor of Internet Tonight and Sasquatch Hunter * Michaela Pereira, former HLN host * Chris Pirillo, created own website * Victoria Reca√±o, formerly at KTLA * Becky Worley, tech contributor for ABC TV's Good Morning America * Liam Mayclem, Formerly Correspondent Internet Tonight Host Audiofile NOW KCBS FOODIE CHAP KCBS RADIO *Tammy Cavadias, Community Production Manager =Virtual characters= Many of the founding staff of ZDTV had previously worked on MSNBC's The Site, which featured Dev Null, a virtual animated character voiced by Leo Laporte who interacted with host Soledad O'Brien. Improving on the technology used for Dev Null, ZDTV created two animated virtual characters who appeared as hosts for the network. Dash (voiced first by Paul McKinney and later by Patrick Flick and Chris Manners, with body performance by Jessa Brie Moreno and later Slater Penney) and Tilde (voiced by Kate Botello and later by Laura LeBleu, with body performance by Jessa Brie Moreno, in some support chat appearances Tilde was played by Theresa Quinn, Asst Production Manager ) appeared in on-air and online promos for the network. Dash also appeared as a virtual correspondent on the show Internet Tonight in a segment called \\"The Homepage Hall of Fame\\" and briefly as the host of \\"Dash's Animation House.\\" History =ZDTV= ZDTV logo The channel originally launched on Monday May 11, 1998, in Las Vegas, Detroit, parts of Georgia near Atlanta and parts of Maine. Vulcan Ventures first invested in ZDTV, a network that supplemented content from Ziff-Davis' computer and technology based print publications (at the time including PC Magazine, MacWEEK, and eWEEK), in November 1998, acquiring a one-third interest from Ziff-Davis. In November 1999, Vulcan purchased the remaining two-thirds in a transaction that was completed on January 21, 2000. The deal (which permitted Vulcan to temporarily continue using the \\"ZD\\" initials and \\"red diamond\\" logo) was worth approximately $204.8 million. An early adopter of ZDTV was Charter Communications, which began carrying the channel in Newnan, Georgia in July 1998. Beginning on Saturday August 1, 1998, ZDTV was broadcast in its native San Francisco, when the channel struck a deal with DirecTV to become available on Channel 273, via the providers' satellite dishes. In July 2000, it was announced that ZDNet would be acquired by CNET, placing ZDTV in the awkward position of using the initials and logo of a company that soon would belong to its main TV programming rival. However, a new name was already being worked on. =TechTV= On September 18, 2000, ZDTV was renamed TechTV, and a new on-air strategy was announced along with several new series including the music- technology series, AudioFile. Soon, TechTV made a huge commitment to enter into live broadcasting when it launched a nine-hour experimental news program called TechLive in April 2001. The show, which catered to daytraders and business types, never caught on with TechTV's audience. In November 2001, following a massive round of layoffs, TechLive was divided into three one-hour shows. In the spring of 2002, TechLive was cut further into just one thirty- minute daily news magazine show, with a focus less on tech news and more on how technology changed people's lives. Beginning March 15, 2001, TechTV experienced repeated layoffs. In 2002, Silicon Spin (an opinion forum hosted by PC Magazine editor John C. Dvorak from the original ZDTV launched in May 1998) and AudioFile (a show for digital music enthusiasts launched in August 2000) were canceled, with its hosts being absorbed onto other network programs. 2003 saw the introduction of several new shows (such as Performance, Robot Wars, and Unscrewed with Martin Sargent). In late 2001 and early 2002, many Comcast cable systems dropped TechTV from their channel lineups. At the time, some viewers speculated that this was done to eliminate a competitor to the Comcast-owned G4. When Comcast's G4 Media acquired TechTV and merged it with G4 in 2004, a second theory emerged, which suggested that Comcast's actual motive was to lower TechTV's value, and ultimately its asking price. TechTV was also broadcast over the air on KTQW in Wichita, Kansas until the TechTV name was dropped during the G4 merger. In Davenport, Iowa from early 2001. St. Ambrose University carried the show feed for most of the day and early evening on their cable channel. For a short time after the change to G4TechTV it still carried the feed. It was dropped after complaints about some of the G4 later programming. =International distribution= A Canadian version of TechTV launched on September 7, 2001, as a joint venture of TechTV, Rogers Media, and Shaw Communications. The channel would later become G4techTV Canada to coincide with the American merger of TechTV and G4. The channel would change its name once again in mid-2009 to G4 Canada. In 2004, TechTV launched on Foxtel Digital in Australia. After the merger with G4, TechTV (then called G4techTV) left Australia lineups as its international feed ceased. On Malaysia's ASTRO platform, repeats of the international feed was run for some time after the international feed ceased before starting to import G4TV programming and retransmitting them locally on the same channel as the public educational service TV Pendidikan from 2002 to 2006. In Japan, Sony's So-net channel aired several TechTV programs until the fall of 2005 (they aired reruns after May 2004). In New Zealand, TechTV aired on Saturn Communications's channel 34 until May 2004. In addition to those countries, TechTV had existence in Russia and the United Kingdom. Merger and consolidation On March 25, 2004, Comcast's G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV and Leo Laporte, who, because of a contract dispute with Vulcan, left the channel. Shows with Laporte, including The Screen Savers and Call for Help, continued on with remaining staff taking over his hosting duties. Around May 6, 2004, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 16, 2004, allowing approximately 8 to 10 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles if they agreed to relocate there. Shows from TechTV that weren't redundant to G4's offerings continued on until July, when the closing of the TechTV Offices would close the respective stages for these shows in turn. On May 10, 2004, G4 Media completed the acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan. G4techTV was launched in the U.S. on May 28, 2004. This led to the cancellation of many of the TechTV channels throughout carriers across the world (e.g.: systems with both channels active, systems limiting Comcast's number of channels on their lineup, etc.) On January 3, 2005, TechTV International began airing select programs from G4techTV. After the closure deadline passed on July 16, 2004, only Los Angeles produced shows would air on the new channel. The final production originating at TechTV in San Francisco was the September 2, 2004, episode of The Screen Savers (which was taped on July 16, 2004). On February 15, 2005, the TechTV brand was dropped from the United States G4techTV feed, leaving the network name as G4 ‚Äì Video Game Television which also echoed the changes in programming made to the channel due to the merger for both G4's original offering and the greatly diminished TechTV originated shows (exceptions noted below); since then, G4 has gone through a rebranding and has changed all programming current and future to position itself as a male oriented network. =TechTV shows and personalities who survived the merger= The Screen Savers survived somewhat in Attack of the Show!, remaining an open-format hosted talk show. On March 17, 2005, the staff made an announcement that they intended to reformat The Screen Savers to better fit the network, including the change of its name (a computer term for a program to protect a monitor from burned-in imagery, which no longer fit when The Screen Savers stopped covering computer self-help and DIY programming). It changed to Attack of the Show (a reference to the Star Wars prequel \\"Attack of the Clones\\"), and while still covering technology to a lesser extent, it also covers autos, sports, movies, new products and pop culture. Kevin Rose, Sarah Lane, and Brendan Moran stayed on after the transition to Attack of the Show for a short time, but Rose left on May 27, 2005, and both Lane and Moran left after their marriage on April 6, 2006, marking the final TechTV on-camera staff's exit from the program. Kevin Pereira was the sole staff member who was present after the show moved to Los Angeles and remained host of Attack of the Show with other post-merger G4 staff until his departure, May 31, 2012. Six TechTV personalities, Kevin Rose, Sarah Lane, Morgan Webb, Adam Sessler, Chi-Lan Lieu and Brendan Moran relocated to Los Angeles to join G4. Only two TechTV shows, Anime Unleashed and X-Play, survived the merger without any major changes. Anime Unleashed (and in turn, all of the anime series which aired on the block) was canceled in March 2006. X-Play was the last TechTV-created show in production under G4 until it was announced in late 2012 that it and Attack of the Show would both be cancelled in December 2012. In April 2012, Sessler was let go from G4. A proper reason was not given, however there have been rumors of a contractual dispute. Sessler was the last of the original hosts from the initial launch of ZDTV in 1998. When the network withdrew all their live programming in December 2012, Blair Butler and Webb were the only remaining TechTV personalities working at G4.

The term originated in the medieval church, where it signified a post without any responsibility for the \\"cure [care] of souls\\", the regular liturgical and pastoral functions of a cleric, but came to be applied to any post, secular or ecclesiastical, that involved little or no actual work. Sinecures have historically provided a potent tool for governments or monarchs to distribute patronage, while recipients are able to store up titles and easy salaries. A sinecure can also be given to an individual whose primary job is in another office, but requires a sinecure title to perform that job. For example, the Government House Leader in Canada is often given a sinecure ministry position so that he or she may become a member of the Cabinet. Similar examples are the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the British cabinet. Other sinecures operate as legal fictions, such as the British office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, used as a legal excuse for resigning from Parliament. History Marco Cornaro investing Marco, abbot of Carrara, with his benefice. Titian, c. 1520 Sinecure, properly a term of ecclesiastical law for a benefice without the cure of souls, arose in the English Church when the rector had no cure of souls nor resided in the parish, the work of the incumbent being performed by a vicar. Such sinecure rectories were expressly granted by the patron. They were abolished by parliament under the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act of 1840. Other ecclesiastical sinecures were certain cathedral dignities to which no spiritual functions attached or incumbencies where by reason of depopulation and the like, the parishioners disappeared or the parish church was allowed to decay. Such cases eventually ceased to exist.Cf. M. Guasco, Storia del clero, Laterza (1997), p.20 The term is also used of any office or place to which salary emoluments or dignity, but no duties are attached. The British civil service and the royal household, for example, were loaded with innumerable offices which, by lapse of time, had become sinecures and were only kept as the reward of political services or to secure voting power in parliament. They were prevalent in the 18th century, but were gradually abolished by statutes during that and the following centuries.

During the 1642 to 1646 First English Civil War, he served as Royalist commander in the West Country, and was made Baron Hopton of Stratton in 1643. Along with his close friend Sir Edward Hyde (later the Earl of Clarendon), he was made advisor to the future Charles II, when he was appointed to rule the West in early 1644. He commanded the last significant Royalist field army, and followed Charles into exile after surrendering in March 1646. A devout supporter of the Church of England, his personal opposition to Catholicism and Presbyterianism meant he took no further part in the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms. He died in Bruges in 1652. In his account of the war, Clarendon described him as 'a man of great honour, integrity, and piety, of great courage and industry, and an excellent officer for any command but the supreme, to which he was not equal'. Life Ralph Hopton was born in early 1596, and baptised on 13 March at St Peter's, in Evercreech. He was the eldest child of Robert Hopton, 1575 to 1638, and Jane ( Kemeys, circa 1570 to 1610, who owned estates in Monmouthshire. His grandfather's lands in Suffolk had been sold to provide dowries for his ten surviving daughters, and Robert inherited Witham Friary in Somerset, acquired from Glastonbury Abbey after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. He was educated at a local grammar school, possibly King's School, Bruton; various sources confirm he attended Lincoln College, Oxford, as did his uncle, Sir Arthur Hopton. In 1614, he studied law at Middle Temple in London, thus completing the education common for a man of his standing at the time. He married Elizabeth Capel (1596-1646) in 1623; their marriage was childless. His estates were inherited by his nephew Thomas Wyndham, son of his eldest sister Catherine. Career =1615 to 1642= Hopton helped Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, escape from Prague in 1620 From 1615 to 1618, Hopton was travelling in Europe, in order to 'learn languages'. In 1620, he joined an English volunteer force under Sir Horace Vere, sent to support Frederick of the Palatinate, newly appointed Protestant king of Bohemia. This was authorised by James I, whose daughter, Elizabeth, was Frederick's wife; Hopton's younger sister Abigail was one of her Maids of Honour. After Frederick's defeat at White Mountain in November 1620, he and his close friend William Waller were among those who escorted the Royal couple to safety, the Queen reportedly riding on his horse. They finally reached safety in the Dutch Republic in early 1621. Hopton returned to London in February, and elected Member of Parliament, or MP, for Shaftesbury, a constituency controlled by the Earl of Pembroke, a connection of his mother, Jane. Parliament's fury at James' lack of support for his sister, and the Protestant cause in general, found an outlet in charges against an elderly Catholic lawyer, Edward Floyd, accused of insulting Frederick. Despite his personal anti-Catholicism, Hopton argued Floyd should not be condemned without a proper hearing; he was ultimately released, after James intervened. When Parliament adjourned in June, he enlisted in Sir Charles Rich's Regiment of Foot, serving in the Palatinate campaign against the Catholic League. It appears likely he was among the English garrison of Frankenthal, which was ordered by James to surrender in March 1623. Back in England, he married Elizabeth Capell, five years his senior, and widow of Justinian Lewin, a Privy Councillor; while childless, their marriage was apparently happy. Invited to stand as MP for Somerset in 1624, he declined, instead joining an English force recruited by Mansfeld to relieve Breda, then besieged by the Spanish. They arrived in the Dutch Republic in February 1625, reportedly in an 'appalling state;' the expedition collapsed, Breda surrendered, and Hopton returned home in July. In his absence, Hopton was appointed MP for Bath in place of Nicholas Hyde, who switched to Bristol; Hyde was the uncle of Edward Hyde, future Earl of Clarendon. Their connection links Hopton with the constitutional monarchists, those who opposed attempts by Charles I to rule without Parliament, but ultimately supported him in 1642. Hopton's friend and political associate, Edward Hyde, future Earl of Clarendon During the 1625 to 1630 Anglo-Spanish War, Hopton refused to take part in the C√°diz expedition, accurately predicting its failure due to lack of funding. He was made a Knight of the Bath in February 1626, and MP for Wells in 1628. The following year, Charles dissolved Parliament, and did not recall it until 1640. Appointed Deputy lieutenant of Somerset, and a Justice of the Peace, Hopton inherited his father's estates in 1638. He avoided involvement in the political debates of the 1630s, but supported the levying of Ship money, and in 1639, raised a troop of cavalry to fight in the first of the 1639 and 1640 Bishops Wars. Charles refused to seek financing from Parliament, and the result was chaos; although he assembled 15,000 men at York, the vast majority were untrained, unfed, unpaid and mutinous conscripts from the Northern trained bands, armed with bows and arrows. He was obliged to agree the Treaty of Berwick, leaving the Covenanters in control of Scotland. Seeking funds for another attempt, in early 1640 Charles called what became known as the Short Parliament; Hopton was selected for Somerset, but the house refused to provide taxes without concessions, and was dissolved after three weeks. Hopton took no part in the 1640 war, another humiliating defeat; he was MP for Wells in the Long Parliament, this time called to raise the money to pay the Scots to return large parts of Northern England. Along with Edward Hyde and other moderates, he voted for the execution of Charles' chief advisor, the Earl of Strafford; unlike them, he also backed the strongly anti-Catholic Grand Remonstrance in late 1641. A committed supporter of the Church of England, the arrest of Archbishop Laud and exclusion of bishops from the Lords seems to have been the point when he changed sides. He defended the attempt to arrest the Five Members in January 1642, and in early March, was held in the Tower of London for two weeks for objecting to Parliament censuring the king. =1642 to 1646= After his release in March, Hopton was appointed Royalist Commissioner of Array for Somerset, placing him in command of the local trained bands. Despite Hopton's connections, the county was dominated by Parliament, forcing him to withdraw to Sherborne, in Dorset; the First English Civil War began on 22 August, when Charles raised his standard at Nottingham. Charles named the Marquess of Hertford as his Lieutenant General in the West. Threatened by a larger Parliamentary army under the Earl of Bedford, the Royalists retreated from Wells to Minehead, where Hopton advised Hertford to take the infantry and artillery across the water to South Wales. Accompanied by a small force of cavalry, Hopton joined Sir Bevil Grenville and other supporters in Cornwall. Under his command, the Royalists won victories at Braddock Down in January 1643, then Stratton in May. After the inconclusive Battle of Lansdowne on 5 July, he linked up with Hertford and Prince Maurice; their combined force destroyed William Waller's Western Association army at Roundway Down on 13 July. The biggest Royalist success of the war, it secured the West Country, apart from isolated garrisons in Plymouth and elsewhere. Temporarily blinded by an explosion after Lansdowne, Hopton was confirmed as Royalist commander in the West, made Baron Hopton of Stratton, and governor of Bristol. In September, it was agreed Prince Rupert would move against London, while Hopton advanced into Hampshire and Sussex, whose iron foundries were Parliament's main source of armaments. However, Rupert was checked at Newbury on 20 September, and although Hopton reached Winchester in November, he was prevented from moving further. In March 1644, he was defeated at Cheriton, ending the Royalist campaign in Southern England, and damaging his position with Charles. Although he served in the Lostwithiel campaign, his main role became one of administration; in early 1645, he was appointed to the Council advising the future Charles II. After Naseby in June, the Western Army was the last significant Royalist field force, but was scattered by the New Model Army at Langport in July. Hopton succeeded Lord Goring as commander in January 1646, but the remnants of his army were defeated at Torrington on 16 February 1646. He pulled back to Truro, where he surrendered to Thomas Fairfax on 12 March. =1646 to 1652= St Mary's, Witham Friary Along with Edward Hyde, he followed the Prince of Wales to Jersey; like the majority of his advisors, they refused to accompany him to Paris, concerned over the influence of his strongly Catholic mother, Henrietta Maria. His wife died shortly after, and in 1647, he moved to Rouen, where he stayed with his uncle, Sir Arthur Hopton, former Ambassador in Madrid. He resumed his position as advisor to Charles II during the 1648 to 1649 Second English Civil War, which continued after the execution of Charles I in January 1649. He resigned after Charles II signed the 1650 Treaty of Breda, which agreed to impose Presbyterianism on England in return for Scottish support in restoring him to the throne. An Episcopalian Church of England was central to Hopton's political beliefs, and he refused to support it. While in exile, he wrote Bellum civile, an account of his campaign in the West from 1642 to 1644. He died at Bruges in September 1652, and after the 1660 Restoration, his body was reburied at St Mary's, in Witham Friary. Confiscated by Parliament in 1647, his estates were returned to his family, and inherited by his nephew Thomas Wyndham.

He died at the age of 25 in a car accident,[ allmusic Biography] leaving behind four years' worth of recordings. He was also a composer of note: his compositions \\"Sandu,\\" \\"Joy Spring,\\" and \\"Daahoud\\" have become jazz standards. Brown won the Down Beat critics' poll for New Star of the Year in 1954; he was inducted into the DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1972 in the critics' poll. He influenced later jazz trumpeters such as Booker Little, Freddie Hubbard, and Lee Morgan. Biography Brown was born into a musical family in a progressive East-Side neighborhood of Wilmington, Delaware. His father organized his four youngest sons, including Clifford, into a vocal quartet. Around age ten, Brown started playing trumpet at school after becoming fascinated with the shiny trumpet his father owned. At age thirteen, upon entering senior high, his father bought him his own trumpet and provided him with private lessons. As a junior in high school, he received lessons from Robert Boysie Lowery and played in \\"a jazz group that Lowery organized.\\" He even began making trips to Philadelphia. Brown took pride in his neighborhood and earned a good education from Howard High. Brown briefly attended Delaware State University as a math major, before he switched to Maryland State College, which was a more prosperous musical environment. As Nick Catalano points out, Brown's trips to Philadelphia grew in frequency after he graduated from high school and entered Delaware State University; it could be said that, although his dorm was in Dover, his classroom was in Philadelphia. Brown played in the fourteen-piece, jazz-oriented, Maryland State Band. In June 1950, he was seriously injured in a car accident after a successful gig. During his year-long hospitalization, Dizzy Gillespie visited the younger trumpeter and pushed him to pursue his musical career. Brown's injuries limited him to the piano for months; he never fully recovered and would routinely dislocate his shoulder for the rest of his life. Brown moved into playing music professionally, where he quickly became one of the most highly regarded trumpeters in jazz. Brown was influenced and encouraged by Fats Navarro, whom he first met at the age of 15, sharing Navarro's virtuosic technique and brilliance of invention. His sound was warm and round, and notably consistent across the full range of the instrument. He could articulate every note, even at very fast tempos which seemed to present no difficulty to him; this served to enhance the impression of his speed of execution. His sense of harmony was highly developed, enabling him to deliver bold statements through complex harmonic progressions (chord changes), and embodying the linear, \\"algebraic\\" terms of bebop harmony. In addition to his up-tempo prowess, he could express himself deeply in a ballad performance. His first recordings were with R&B; bandleader Chris Powell, following which he performed with Tadd Dameron, J. J. Johnson, Lionel Hampton, and Art Blakey before forming his own group with Max Roach. The Clifford Brown & Max Roach Quintet was a high-water mark of the hard bop style, with all the members of the group except for bassist George Morrow contributing original songs. Brown's trumpet was originally partnered with Harold Land's tenor saxophone. After Land left in 1955 in order to spend more time with his wife, Sonny Rollins joined and remained a member of the group for the rest of its existence. In their hands, the bebop vernacular reached a peak of inventiveness. The clean-living Brown escaped the influence of heroin and alcohol on the jazz world. Brown stayed away from drugs and was not fond of alcohol. Rollins, who was recovering from heroin addiction, said that \\"Clifford was a profound influence on my personal life. He showed me that it was possible to live a good, clean life and still be a good jazz musician.\\" In June 1956, Brown and Richie Powell embarked on a drive to Chicago for their next appearance. Powell's wife Nancy was at the wheel so that Clifford and Richie could sleep. While driving at night in the rain on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, west of Bedford, she is presumed to have lost control of the car, which went off the road, killing all three in the resulting crash. Brown is buried in Mt. Zion Cemetery, in Wilmington, Delaware.  Family  On June 26, 1954, in Los Angeles, Brown married Emma LaRue Anderson (1933‚Äì2005), who he called \\"Joy Spring\\". The two had been introduced by Max Roach. They actually celebrated their marriage vows three times, partly because their families were on opposite coasts and partly because of their differing religions ‚Äì Brown was Methodist and Anderson was Catholic. They were first married in a private ceremony June 26, 1954, in Los Angeles (on Anderson's st birthday). They again celebrated their marriage in a religious setting on July 16, 1954 ‚Äì the certificate being registered in Los Angeles County ‚Äì and a reception was held at the Tiffany Club where the Art Pepper/Jack Montrose Quintet had been replaced a few days earlier by the Red Norvo Trio with Tal Farlow and Red Mitchell. Then, Anderson's parish priest followed them to Boston, where, on August 1, 1954, they performed their marriage ceremony at Saint Richards Church in the Roxbury neighborhood. They had a son, Clifford Benjamin Brown, Jr. (born 1955). Legacy His nephew, drummer Rayford Griffin (n√© Rayford Galen Griffin; born 1958), modernized Brown's music on his 2015 album Reflections of Brownie. Brown's grandson, Clifford Benjamin Brown III (born 1982), plays trumpet on one of the tracks, \\"Sandu\\". Benny Golson, who had done a stint in Lionel Hampton's band with Brown, and was a member along with Brown of Tadd Dameron's Big 10, wrote \\"I Remember Clifford\\" to honor his memory. The piece became a jazz standard, as musicians paid tribute by recording their own interpretations of it. Duke Pearson, who had yet to record for Blue Note records, wrote \\"Tribute To Brownie\\", which was recorded by the Cannonball Adderley Quintet on Adderley's 1957 album, Sophisticated Swing. It also appeared on an album by trumpeter Louis Smith, Here Comes Louis Smith with Cannonball again on alto saxophone. Helen Merrill, who recorded with Brown in 1954 (Helen Merrill, EmArcy), recorded a tribute album in 1995 entitled Brownie: Homage to Clifford Brown. The album features solos and ensemble work by trumpeters Lew Soloff, Tom Harrell, Wallace Roney, and Roy Hargrove. Arturo Sandoval's entire second album after fleeing from his native Cuba, entitled I Remember Clifford, was likewise a tribute to Brown. Each year, Wilmington hosts the Clifford Brown Jazz Festival. Brownie Speaks, a video documentary, is the culmination of years of research by Wilmington-born jazz pianist Don Glanden, research that has included interviews with Brown's friends, family, contemporaries, and admirers. Glanden's son Brad edited these interviews, along with archival materials and newly shot video footage. The documentary premiered in 2008 at the \\"Brownie Speaks\\" Clifford Brown Symposium hosted by the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. The three-day symposium featured performances from close friends and bandmates of Brown such as Golson and Lou Donaldson and other artists inspired by Brown, including Marcus Belgrave, Terence Blanchard, and John Fedchock. Spanish film director Jes√∫s Franco often used Clifford Brown as a screen pseudonym in homage to one of his musical heroes. In 1994, Brown's widow, LaRue Brown Watson, established the Clifford Brown Jazz Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to Brown's memory and inspiring a love for jazz among young people. The Foundation is under the direction of Clifford Brown III, Brown's grandson and a respected Bay Area trumpeter and music producer. In 2014, a campaign was launched to restore Brown's grave site at Mt. Zion Cemetery on Lancaster Pike, just outside the city limits in Wilmington, Delaware.

Aztalan State Park is a Wisconsin state park in the Town of Aztalan, Jefferson County, at latitude N 43¬∞ 4‚Ä≤ and longitude W 88¬∞ 52‚Ä≤. Established in 1952, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The park covers 172 acres (0.7 km¬≤ or 70 ha) along the Crawfish River. Approximate areas of Mississippian and related cultures. Aztalan is in the Oneota region of the map. Aztalan is the site of an ancient Mississippian culture settlement that flourished during the 10th to 13th centuries. The indigenous people constructed massive earthwork mounds for religious and political purposes. They were part of a widespread culture with important settlements throughout the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries. Their trading network extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast, and into the southeast of the present-day United States. Pre-history (900‚Äì1300) Aztalan was first settled around 900 by a Native American culture known as the Middle Mississippian Tradition. The chief center of a Middle Mississippian settlement is at Cahokia, in present-day Illinois, a city that at its peak had 20,000‚Äì30,000 people. This was not surpassed by Europeans in North America until after 1800. These settlements are characterized by the construction of mounds, stockades, and houses, by decorated Mississippian culture pottery and agricultural practices. There are also elements of the Woodland culture found there. The residents had long-distance trading relationships with other settlements, linked by their use of the rivers for transportation. For example, items found at the settlement include copper from Michigan's Upper Peninsula, shells from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and stone such as Mill Creek chert from other areas of the Midwest. Sometime between 1200 and 1300, the Aztalan settlement was abandoned. Archeologists and historians surmise they may have outgrown environmental resources, or encountered more warfare from other cultures, but do not know for sure. The Little Ice Age occurred soon after 1300 and may have contributed to farming difficulties, putting too much stress on the local chiefdoms. =Life in Aztalan= Most of the residents lived in circular or rectangular houses which they built between the river and the eastern secondary wall. The placement of the structures suggests that the layout was planned. The dwellings were built around a central ceremonial plaza likely used for rituals and public gatherings, as has been found at similar locations. Posts for the house frames were placed either in individual holes, or in a trench dug slightly narrower than the posts. The walls were completed with wattle and daub, a plaster mixture of grass and clay. The roof was covered with bark or thatch. The doorway usually faced south to keep out the winter's north winds. Inside, a single family slept on pole-frame beds, covered with tamarack boughs, deer skins, and furs. Sometimes a fire was kept in the middle of the house and a hole in the roof let out the smoke. Storage pits dug in the earthen floor of the house held foods such as corn, nuts, and seeds in woven bags. Perishable foods like meat were most likely stored outside prior to cooking. Refuse pits for garbage and community storage pits were located outside. The site was well chosen to provide a variety of food sources, and other resources. The staple of the diet was corn or maize, and other plants were also gathered as food, such as acorns, hickory nuts, and berries. Tobacco was grown at this time for sacred rituals, as tobacco seeds have been found at this site. The main source of meat was deer, especially in the winter. The people also caught and ate beaver, elk, fox, muskrats, and raccoons. They hunted birds and turtles, collected mussels, and caught fish in the Crawfish River directly next to the site. To help with fishing, the people set up rock barriers called fish weirs at key points, one of which is visible when the river is low. They caught catfish, bass, suckers, buffalo fish, pike, drum fish, and gar. They disposed of the thousands of shells from consumed mussels in middens. These have layers of shells several feet thick. The people living here gathered food and resources for tools and building. Other materials were obtained through trade. They hunted small game and deer and fished the rivers. Trees nearby provided wood for posts for house walls and stockades, bows and arrow shafts, and firewood. Smaller tree branches and grass were used for bedding and roofs. Shells were used to make jewelry, beads, spoons, and digging tools. The people dug river clay which was used to fashion fired pottery. Traded items, used for ornamental or ceremonial purposes, were an attribute of status because of their rarity. Replica of a house built over 1000 years ago at Aztalan from an exhibit in the Wisconsin Historical Museum Interior of Aztalan house in museum exhibit =Physical features= Reconstructed stockade behind the northwestern mound The most obvious features of Aztalan are its pyramid-shaped, flat-topped platform mounds and the stockades, believed to have served both ceremonial and defensive functions. Mounds Three platform mounds remain on the site. The largest is the one in the southwest corner of the stockade; one almost as large is located in the northwest corner. The smallest of the three is along the east side of the settlement, near the Crawfish River (labeled \\"West Branch of Rock River\\" on the plates). The hill in the southeast corner is a natural gravel knoll, not built by the inhabitants. With The largest mound was built in three stages, with a set of steps leading to the top, where a structure was built over the entire flat top. The mound was covered with a clay cap, probably to enhance its appearance. Corn was stored in pits inside the structure. Scholars have several theories about why the corn was kept there, and the overall purpose of the structure. It may have been the storage facility for the entire village or storage for food just for the top village officials; it may have been used for ceremonies and rituals; or it could have been a house for the village officials. This topmost structure was rebuilt each time a larger stage of the mound was built on top of the old. The northwestern mound, used for formal burial, was also built in three stages. A special structure, approximately by , with its long axis towards the northeast/southwest, was built on the west side of the mound. Its doorway was in its southwest corner, and the structure was covered with a mixture of clay, willow branches, and grass. The floor was covered with a mat of what may have been cattails. The bodies of ten people were placed side by side on this, with their heads toward the doorway. The bones of another person were bundled together with cord and placed near them. Once this construction was complete, and the bodies were inside, the building was burned. The eastern mound had a large open-walled structure, about by , built on top of it, with firepits lined with white sand inside. The function of this mound and structure remain unclear. Additionally, to the northwest of the stockaded area, a row of round mounds extends northward. When archaeologists dug in these mounds during the 1920s, they did not find the burial sites they had expected. Instead, each mound had a large post set in a pit in its center, surrounded by gravel and soil, with the pit capped with clay and gravel to hold the post steady. These mounds have been termed \\"marker mounds\\" because they may have been used to mark the site for travelers, but this is not certain. They may also have been used for announcements, message relays, or for calculations of astronomical phenomena, as has been found at other Mississippian sites, such as Cahokia. Stockade Reconstructed stockade near the Crawfish River The settlement was surrounded on the north, west, and south sides by a palisade, a wall of logs set vertically into the ground. Narrow holes were dug into the ground, then the posts were lifted into position and set into the holes. The stockade was finished by people weaving flexible willow branches through the posts, and plastering the whole with a mixture of clay and grass to fill in the gaps, a technique similar to wattle and daub. At some point, a smaller stockade was built within the outer one to delimit the dwelling areas. Archeologists have not been able to determine whether both stockades existed simultaneously, for a layered defense, or one was built after the other fell into disuse. In 1850, Increase A. Lapham, an author, scientist, and naturalist, surveyed the site on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution. He described the outer stockade as being \\" long at the north end, long on the west side and on the south side; making a total length of wall of . The ridge or wall is about , and from to ) in height\\".Lapham, Increase A. The Antiquities of Wisconsin. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1855. p. 43. It had at least 33 square bastions at regular intervals along its length, similar in form and placement to some European fortifications, in order to allow defensive warriors to cover that area by shooting arrows. In addition, others were built along the secondary walls. Rather than having a gate to protect the entrance, the builders constructed the entrance so that it was camouflaged from direct view and blended in with the wall on either side. During the time Aztalan was inhabited, two sets of outer stockades were built. The posts of the first one eventually rotted, and the second one burned and was never rebuilt. It is not clear whether the purpose of the stockade was to keep out invaders, or if the occupants built it for another reason. Modern discovery (1835‚Äì1919) A young man named Timothy Johnson discovered the ruins of the ancient settlement in December 1835. In January 1836, N. F. Hyer conducted the first rough survey of the site, and published his discovery in the Milwaukie Advertiser of January 1837. According to Lapham: > The name Aztalan was given to this place by Mr. Hyer, because, according to > Humboldt, the Aztecs, or ancient inhabitants of Mexico, had a tradition that > their ancestors came from a country at the north, which they called Aztalan; > and the possibility that these may have been remains of their occupancy, > suggested the idea of restoring the name. It is made up of two Mexican > words, atl, water, and an, near; and the country was probably so named from > its proximity to large bodies of water. Hence the natural inference that the > country about these great lakes was the ancient residence of the > Aztecs.Lapham (1855), Antiquities of Wisconsin, p. 42 Hyer wrote, \\"We are determined to preserve these ruins from being ruined.\\" However, in 1838, President Martin Van Buren refused a request by Massachusetts statesman Edward Everett to withdraw the site from public sale, and it was sold for $22. In the following years, the surface was plowed, the mounds were leveled for easier farming, pottery shards and \\"Aztalan brick\\" were hauled away by the wagonload to fill in potholes in township roads, and souvenir hunters took numerous artifacts. In 1850, Lapham urged the preservation of the stockade. At the time, the stockade was still standing, though not in the condition it had once been. State park foundation and reconstruction (1919‚Äìpresent) Historic marker for Aztalan State Park In 1919, archeological excavations began at Aztalan under the direction of Dr. S. A. Barrett. In 1920, the Landmarks Committee of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin under Publius V. Lawson started a new effort to save what remained of Aztalan, supported by the Friends of Our Native Landscape and the Wisconsin Archeological Society. They made their first purchase of some of the land in 1921, three acres (12,000 m¬≤) west of the stockade and containing eight conical mounds, and presented it to the Wisconsin Archeological Society. Work for preservation continued. In 1936, the state's archeological and historical societies petitioned the federal government for funds to reconstruct the stockade, without success, although during the Great Depression it funded archeological work and preservation at numerous ancient sites around the country. In 1941, the newly founded Lake Mills-Aztalan Historical Society began an energetic campaign to preserve the stockade area. In 1945, the Wisconsin State Assembly passed a bill directing the State Planning Board to study the possibility of establishing a state park at Aztalan. In 1947, the Wisconsin State Legislature passed a resolution requesting the State Conservation Commission to purchase Aztalan. 120 acres (490,000 m¬≤) were purchased to this end in 1948, and the Wisconsin Archeological Society and the Lake Mills-Aztalan Historical Society donated their holdings. Aztalan opened to the public as Aztalan State Park in 1952. Aztalan was designated a registered National Historic Landmark in 1964 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. In 1968, the state reconstructed portions of the stockade wall by placing new posts in the original holes. A section of this was also covered with the wattle and daub, but this has since worn away or been removed.

While public grievances had existed for years, it was the rebellion in Lower Canada (present-day Quebec), which started the previous month, that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to revolt. The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838. While it shrank, it became more violent, mainly through the support of the Hunters' Lodges, a secret United States-based militia that emerged around the Great Lakes, and launched the Patriot War in 1838‚Äì39. Some historians suggest that although they were not directly successful or large, the rebellions in 1837 should be viewed in the wider context of the late 18th and early 19th century Atlantic Revolutions including the American Revolutionary War in 1776, the French Revolution of 1789‚Äì99, the Haitian Revolution of 1791‚Äì1804, the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and the independence struggles of Spanish America (1810‚Äì25). While these rebellions differed in that they also struggled for republicanism, they were inspired by similar social problems stemming from poorly regulated oligarchies, and sought the same democratic ideals, which were also shared by the United Kingdom's Chartists.Ducharme, Michel (2010) Le concept de libert√© au Canada √† l‚Äô√©poque des R√©volutions atlantiques (1776‚Äì1838) McGill/Queens University Press: Montreal/Kingston. The book was awarded the John A. MacDonald award for best book 2010 by the Canadian Historical AssociationWim Klooster, Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History (2009) The rebellion led directly to Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America, and to The British North America Act, 1840, which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system, leading to the formation of Canada as a nation in 1867. Reform movement and rebellion organization Because it was put down relatively easily, and was not a sophisticated or sustained military campaign, the Upper Canada Rebellion is sometimes dismissed as a \\"farmers' revolt, but the rebellion was led by Members of Parliament and the Mayor of Toronto, had widespread support, and was part of a global revolutionary movement that used the organizational strategies of the British reform movement, which had achieved the Reform Act 1832 to broaden the electoral franchise and reduce political corruption. The rebellion led to substantive reforms in the British North America Act. =Political unions= The Upper Canada Central Political Union was organized in 1832-3 by Dr Thomas David Morrison (mayor of Toronto in 1836) while William Lyon Mackenzie was in England. This union collected 19,930 signatures on a petition protesting Mackenzie's unjust expulsion from the House of Assembly by the Family Compact. The Reformers won a majority in the elections held in 1834 for the Legislative Assembly of the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada and Mackenzie was again elected as member for York, but the Family Compact held the majority in the Legislative Council, and the two Houses of government were at loggerheads. Marketplaces like St. Lawrence Market were commonly used public spaces by political unions. This union was reorganized as the Canadian Alliance Society in 1835. It shared a large meeting space in the market buildings with the Mechanics Institute and the Children of Peace. The Canadian Alliance Society adopted much of the platform (such as secret ballot & universal suffrage) of the Owenite National Union of the Working Classes in London, England, that were to be integrated into the Chartist movement in England. In pursuit of this democratic goal, the Chartists eventually staged a similar armed rebellion, the Newport Rising, in Wales in 1839. The Canadian Alliance Society was reborn as the Constitutional Reform Society in 1836, when it was led by the more moderate reformer, Dr William W. Baldwin. The Reformers experienced a disaster at the 1836 elections for the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada, and the Society took its final form as the Toronto Political Union in 1837. It was this group of the disenfranchised that began organizing local \\"Vigilance Committees\\" to elect delegates to a so-called Constitutional Convention in July 1837. This became the organizational structure for the Rebellion; most of the rebel organizers were elected Constitutional Convention delegates. =Convention delegates and committees of vigilance= The first of those meetings to select delegates to the constitutional convention were held at Doel's Brewery in Toronto on July 28 and 31. The second meeting was called to order by Samuel Hughes, a member of the Children of Peace, three days later, on August 3 in Newmarket. The meeting appointed Hughes, Samuel Lount, Nelson Gorham, Silas Fletcher, Jeremiah Graham and John McIntosh, M.P.P. as delegates to the convention (and all, with the exception of Hughes and MacIntosh, leaders in the Rebellion). A further eight public meetings across the Home District were scheduled over the next three weeks; each of these public meetings named a local committee of vigilance to organize reform support, prepare a registry of valid electors, and name their delegates to the proposed convention. Immediately preceding the Mackenzie rebellion John Doel's house and brewery were prominent gathering places for the Reformers. The large meetings were usually held in the brewery while smaller meetings of the leaders were held in the home. Mackenzie planned to take foundry-men and axe- makers and seize arms, ammunition, and the artillery from the garrison. They would then arouse the citizens of the town and country to proclaim a provincial government. Mr. Doel objected to the plan and there was a fight between Mackenzie, Doel, and Morrison. The meeting was broken up and Mackenzie left the house forever. From this point forward John Doel, his brewery, and his home were not longer part of the rebellion. The meetings in the Home District met with an increasing amount of Orange Order violence, so that the reformers began to protect themselves and resort to arms to do so. Mackenzie was accompanied by 50 young farmers from the Lloydtown meeting, for example, after they heard that an Orange riot was planned for Albion. As the violence continued, peaceable reform meetings tapered off in October, to be replaced by instances of men drilling for battle. Issues There is no single cause for the Rebellion, only a context. Many of the grievances which underlay the Rebellion involved the provisions of the Constitutional Act of 1791, which had created Upper Canada's political framework. The issues, from the perspective of the reformers, were to an extent summarised in The seventh report from the Select Committee of the House of Assembly of Upper Canada on grievances...,\\"The seventh report from the Select Committee of the House of Assembly of Upper Canada on grievances...\\" and can be related as follows: =Political issues= The alien question Both before and after the War of 1812, the government of Upper Canada continued to fear what it suspected might be a growing interest in American-inspired republicanism in the province. Reasons for this can be found in the pattern of settlement across the province over the previous half-century. Although the British had originally hoped that an orderly settlement in Upper Canada would inspire the former American colonies to abandon their republican form of government, demographic realities intervened. After an initial group of about 70,000 United Empire Loyalists were thinly settled across the province in the mid-1780s, a far larger number of American settlers came after Lieutenant- Governor John Graves Simcoe offered cheap land grants to promote settlement. Although these settlers, known as \\"late-Loyalists,\\" were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown in order to obtain land, their fundamental political allegiances were always considered dubious. By 1812, this had become acutely problematic since the American settlers outnumbered the original Loyalists by more than ten to one. It was this reality that led American legislators to speculate that bringing Upper Canada into the American fold would be a \\"mere matter of marching.\\" Following the war, the colonial government took active steps to prevent Americans from swearing allegiance, thereby making them ineligible to obtain land grants. Relations between the appointed Legislative Council and the elected Legislative Assembly became increasingly strained in the years after the war, over issues of immigration, taxation, banking and land speculation. Family Compact and political corruption The Family Compact was a small, tightly knit group of men who dominated the government of Upper Canada and the financial and religious institutions associated with it. They were the leading members of the administration: executive councillors, legislative councillors, senior officials and some members of the judiciary. Their administrative roles, however, were intimately tied to their business activities: \\"they were not a political elite taking political decisions in a vacuum, but an overlapping elite whose political and economic activities cannot be entirely separated from each other. They might even be called 'entrepreneurs', most of whose political views may have been highly conservative but whose economic outlook was clearly 'developmental'.\\" For example, William Allan, one of the most powerful, \\"was an executive councillor, a legislative councilor, President of the Toronto and Lake Huron Railroad, Governor of the British American Fire and Life Assurance Company and President of the Board of Trade.\\" Mackenzie frequently complained about the manner in which members of the Family Compact utilized their official positions for monetary gain, especially through corporations such as the Bank of Upper Canada, and the two land companies (the Clergy Corporation and the Canada Company) that between them controlled two sevenths of all the land in the province. The Bank of Upper Canada, for example, had been founded by William Allan and the Rev. John Strachan, key members of the Family Compact, both of whom were Executive and Legislative Councillors. Although they lacked the minimum capital needed to found the bank, they persuaded the government to subscribe for a quarter of its shares. During the 1830s, a third of the bank's board were Legislative or Executive Councillors, and the remaining all magistrates. Despite repeated attempts, the elected Legislature - which had chartered the bank - could obtain no details about the bank's workings. Mackenzie saw the bank as a prop of the Government and demanded farmers withdraw their support from it, by withdrawing their specie. The small confidence in the security which most banks gave for their redemption of their issues and the managers refusal to answer reasonable questions put forth by the House resulted in public confidence plummeting. Mackenzie was attempting to drain the banks of their money as a political weapon against the Government in hopes to avoid an armed revolution. However, the bank rebounded from this attack, making this attempt at peaceful revolution a failure. Francis Bond Head and the elections of 1836 The appointment of Francis Bond Head as the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada was initially warmly greeted, though his administration was later met with controversy. Sir Francis Bond Head, the newly appointed Lt. Governor, was initially warmly greeted by the Reform movement. His first move was to broaden the representation on the Executive Council by including the advocate of \\"responsible government\\", Robert Baldwin. Disappointment soon followed when Bond Head made it clear he had no intention of consulting the Executive Council in the daily operations of the administration. The whole Executive Council unanimously resigned, provoking widespread discontent and an election. Unlike previous Lt. Governors, Bond Head threw himself into the electoral fray in support of the Tory candidates, and utilized Orange Order violence in order to ensure their election. In the face of what was believed to be widespread fraud, William Lyon Mackenzie and Samuel Lount lost their seats in the Legislature. The reformers prepared a petition to the Crown protesting the abuses, carried to London by Charles Duncombe, but the Colonial Office refused to hear him. These three men became core organizers of the Rebellion. The now Tory dominated Legislature passed a series of laws that exacerbated tensions: * They passed a law extending the session of the Legislature, even if the King died. William IV was ill, and traditionally, an election had to be called within six months of the death. * They passed a law promoting \\"irresponsible government\\", prohibiting members of the Legislature from serving as Executive Councillors (a cabinet minister). They argued the Executive Councillors needed to be accountable to the Lt. Governor, not the Legislature. * They passed a law making it easier to sue indebted farmers. * They passed laws protecting the Bank of Upper Canada from bankruptcy. * Legislative Councillors all attempted to get charters for their own banks. Republicanism After the 1836 elections, political rhetoric in the province was divisive, and did not allow for dissent. The Royal Standard, a short lived Tory daily, clearly called out for repressive measures. William Lyon Mackenzie launched a new newspaper, the Constitution, on July 4, 1836. Lest the symbolism of the name and date be missed, he began serializing the American Revolutionary, Thomas Paine's tract, Common Sense. A year later, in July 1837, the newly formed Toronto Political Union called for a constitutional convention. The \\"Declaration of the Reformers of the City of Toronto\\" contained provocative references to the American Revolution and included a direct attack on the recently deceased monarch who they held personally responsible for the colony's unrepresentative government. In November 1837, in the lead-up to the Political Union's Constitutional Convention, Mackenzie published a satire in the Constitution, a round table discussion by such luminaries as John Locke, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Oliver Goldsmith and William Pitt and others, said to be a \\"convention sitting in this township for the purpose of circulating political information, weighing opinions as to the best means of improving the civil institutions of the country, and endeavoring to determine whether the British Constitution, Sir F. Head's government or Independence would be the most likely to prove advantageous to the people.\\" As part of this satire, he published a draft republican constitution for Upper Canada. This constitution closely resembled the objectives spelled out in the constitution of the Canadian Alliance Society in 1834; it called for an elected governor, legislative council (senate), House of Assembly and magistracy, all by secret ballot. It was egalitarian, prohibiting both slavery and the granting of \\"hereditary emoluments, privileges, or honors.\\" It also called for a separation of church and state, and barred the clergy from seeking election, or serving in any civil or military office. It guaranteed the rights to personal property, to freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly. But tied to these rights to personal property and egalitarian democracy were severe restrictions on chartering corporations; starting from the premise that \\"Labour is the only means of creating wealth\\" it placed a constitutional prohibition on chartering either banks or trading companies. Reform of the jury system The reformer party in the Legislative Assembly desired that the Jury system be reformed, to the extent that they passed a Jury Law Amendment Bill no less than four times over eight years. This was a contentious issue, and the Legislative Council replied again for the last time in favour of the status quo on February 25, 1836.Proceedings of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada on the bill sent up from the House of Assembly, entitled, An act to amend the jury laws of this province (1836) The defeat of the reformers on June 20, 1836 elections for the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada silenced this legislative outlet of steam, and thus was the stage set for rebellion. =Economic issues= Collapse of the international financial system Democratic cartoon from 1833 showing Jackson destroying the Second Bank of the United States, to the approval of the Uncle Sam like figure to the right, and annoyance of the bank's president, shown as the Devil himself On July 10, 1832, President Andrew Jackson vetoed the bill for the refinancing of the Second Bank of the United States, arguing that it was utilized by a \\"moneyed aristocracy\\" to oppress the common man. The dismantling of the bank plunged the Anglo-American world into an enormous depression (1836‚Äì38) that was worsened by bad wheat harvests in Upper Canada in 1836. Farmers were unable to pay their debts. Most banks - including the Bank of Upper Canada - suspended payments (i.e. declared bankruptcy) by July 1837 and requested government support. While the banks received government support, ordinary farmers and the poor did not. Among the more than 150 lawsuits they launched that year, the Bank of Upper Canada, which served the same purpose as the Bank of the United States, launched a suit against Sheldon, Dutcher & Co., a foundry and Toronto's largest employer with over 80 employees in late 1836, bankrupting the company. Not surprisingly, Mackenzie's first plan for rebellion involved calling on Sheldon & Dutcher's men to storm the city hall, where the militia's guns were stored. Economic distress The brunt of this economic distress was felt by the common farmers. One fifth of British immigrants arrived in Upper Canada impoverished. Most immigrant farmers lacked the capital to pay for purchased land. The large debts they owed were compounded by the bad harvest, and debt collection laws that allowed for them to be jailed indefinitely until they paid their loans off to merchants. The situation was made worse in March 1837 when the Tories passed a law making it cheaper to sue farmers: city merchants could sue in the middle of harvest, and if the farmer refused to come to court in Toronto, they would automatically forfeit the case and be subjected to a sheriff's sale. Provincial debt of Upper Canada The Reformers were incensed at the debt that the family compact had managed to incur as the results of general improvements to the province, such as the Welland Canal. These debts stemmed mostly from investments in canals.Canadian History. Retrieved on July 12, 2013. A man and his team of oxen hired at two dollars per day. The population of the province was estimated at 400,000, while the debt of the province amounted to around 1,000,000 pounds. The annual revenues amounted to 60,000, a sum almost insufficient to pay the interest on the debt. The dissolution of the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada in spring of 1836 resulted from the denial of money bills by the Reformist Legislative Assembly. Confrontation =Toronto Rebellion= Peter Matthews was one of several delegates in support of revolt, in an October 1837 meeting with other reformists and rebels. When the Lower Canada Rebellion broke out on October 9, 1837, Bond Head sent all the British troops stationed in Toronto to help suppress it. At the beginning of November, a meeting of 15 reformers at John Doel's house rejected Mackenzie's call for an immediate attack on City Hall. They instead decided to send Mackenzie north to investigate public sentiment. At a secret meeting in East Gwillimbury, Samuel Lount, Silas Fletcher, Peter Matthews of Pickering, Nelson Gorham of Newmarket, Jesse Lloyd of King township and James Bolton of Albion township heard Lloyd report on the revolt in Lower Canada. All were delegates to the Constitutional Convention. They decided to set the date for a supportive Upper Canadian revolt on December 7. On November 15, Mackenzie published his draft constitution. On November 27, Mackenzie printed a handbill declaring \\"Independence!\\". On November 29, Mackenzie set the date for the Constitutional Convention for December 21, exactly 6 months after the date of King William's death - the Tory dominated elected assembly, which refused to prorogue, would at that time become illegitimate. The delegates to the convention, like Samuel Lount, downplayed the armed aspect of the Rebellion to the farmers he tried to enlist. Lount called a meeting in Hope (now Sharon), the village of the Children of Peace, where he told them \\"there was war in Lower Canada and there was reason to believe that Martial Law would be proclaimed‚Ä¶ he thought the city would be taken without firing a gun.\\" Dr. Rolph, however, had heard that the Lt. Governor had been informed of the plan, and sent a note to Lount moving the march from the north forward to December 4, 1837. When hearing about this change of plans, Mackenzie quickly tried to send a messenger to Lount to tell him not to arrive until December 7. This message was not received in time, with Lount replying that the rebels had already been ordered to march to Toronto and were on their way. Barely armed with pikes and guns for hunting fowl, the farmers from York County marched from Newmarket down Yonge Street towards Toronto and Montgomery's Tavern. Before the direct confrontation between Mackenzie's rebels and Bond Head's militia forces on December 7, there were various encounters between both sides which resulted in small skirmishes. On December 4, Mackenzie and some fellow rebels encountered Alderman John Powell (Canadian politician) and Archibald McDonald when riding down Yonge Street to scout the city. Upon meeting them, Mackenzie took both men prisoner and sent them to Montgomery's Tavern. Although there were concerns over whether Powell and McDonald possessed arms, Mackenzie accepted their denials and said, ‚Äúwell, gentlemen, as you are my townsmen, and men of honor, I would be ashamed to show that I question your words by ordering you to be searched.‚Äù Despite such assurances, Powell had hidden a pistol and shot rebel Captain Anthony Anderson before escaping back to Toronto, thereby dealing a large blow to the rebel's military expertise. Robert Moodie was fatally shot outside of Montgomery's Tavern in an attempt to lead loyalists through the roadblock. As Mackenzie and his forces marched towards Toronto, Bond Head sent a flag to the rebels and asked for their demands, to which Mackenzie demanded ‚ÄúIndependence and a convention to arrange details.‚Äù By the time Mackenzie and his followers had reached College Street, Bond Head sent another party to tell Mackenzie that his demands had been rejected. That same day, Colonel Moodie attempted to ride through a roadblock to warn Bond Head, but the rebels shot him. With the truce faltering, Mackenzie and his forces continued into Toronto, eventually confronting a small loyalist force estimated to be between 15 and 30 members strong. The last real engagement prior to the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern occurred on December 6 via a raid on a mail coach which was suspected to have government intelligence regarding future actions towards the rebels. It was from this raid that the rebels learned of government plans to soon attack Montgomery's Tavern. When the revolt began, Mackenzie hesitated in attacking the city until December 7, when his military leader, Anthony Van Egmond, arrived. Van Egmond, a veteran on both sides of the Napoleonic Wars, advised immediate retreat, but Mackenzie remained hesitant. Mackenzie waited for Bond Head's force of about 1000 men and one cannon, led by Colonel James FitzGibbon, which outnumbered Mackenzie's approximately 400 rebels. When the battle started, Mackenzie split his troops into two groups and put one group on each side of Yonge Street, with the western flank taking the brunt of Bond Head's assault. Outmatched both in weaponry and skill, Mackenzie's rebels lasted about 15 minutes in the battle before retreating. The untested forces dispersed in a panic after the first round of firing thinking the rebel's front row had been killed when they were simply dropping to the ground to allow those behind them to fire. =London Rebellion= News of the intended rebellion had reached London and the surrounding townships by December 7. It was initially thought that the Toronto rebellion was successful, contributing to Charles Duncombe wanting to rise up as well.Read, Colin. The Rising in Western Upper Canada, 1837-1838: The Duncombe Revolt and After. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982, pp. 84-85. Upon hearing more details about the rebellion in Toronto, Duncombe convened a series of public meetings to spread news of the supposed atrocities committed by Bond Head against all suspected reformers to help increase anti- government support. It is estimated that there were between 400-500 rebels who assembled under Duncombe Read, Colin. The Rising in Western Upper Canada, 1837-1838: The Duncombe Revolt and After. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982, p. 94 Colonel Allan MacNab, who had just finished leading Upper Canadian militiamen during the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, was sent to engage Duncombe's uprising. He left Hamilton, Ontario on December 12 and arrived in Brantford on December 13. Although many rebels, including Duncombe, had fled prior to the upcoming battle due to hearing about the failure of Mackenzie in Toronto and general disorganization, there were still some present in Scotland, Ontario and MacNab commenced his attack on Scotland on December 14, causing the remaining rebels to flee after only a few shots were fired.Read, Colin. The Rising in Western Upper Canada, 1837-1838: The Duncombe Revolt and After. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982, pp. 97-99. The victorious Tory supporters burned homes and farms of known rebels and suspected supporters. In the 1860s, some of the former rebels were compensated by the Canadian government for their lost property in the rebellion aftermath. =Rebellion by other means= British forces and the Canadian militia defeated an invasion attempt by a Hunters' Lodges paramilitary unit based in the United States. Mackenzie, Duncombe, John Rolph and 200 supporters fled to Navy Island in the Niagara River, where they declared themselves the Republic of Canada on December 13. They obtained supplies from supporters in the United States, resulting in British reprisals (see Caroline affair). On January 13, 1838, under attack by British armaments, the rebels fled. Mackenzie went to the United States where he was arrested and charged under the Neutrality Act. The other major leaders, Van Egmond, Samuel Lount, and Peter Matthews were arrested by the British; Van Egmond died in prison, and Lount and Matthews were executed at 8 AM on April 12, 1838, in Toronto. Their last words were: \\"Mr. Jarvis, do your duty; we are prepared to meet death and our Judge.\\" The rebels continued their raids into Canada, however, using the U.S. as a base of operations and cooperating with the U.S. Hunters' Lodges, dedicated to the overthrow of British rule in Canada. The raids did not end until the rebels and Hunters were decisively defeated at the Battle of the Windmill, nearly a year after the initial battle at Montgomery's Tavern. Consequences: execution or transportation Proclamation from December 1837, offering a reward for the capture of William Lyon Mackenzie. Compared to the Lower Canada Rebellion, the initial portion of the Upper Canada Rebellion was short and disorganized. However, the British government in London was very concerned about the rebellion, especially in light of the strong popular support for the rebels in the United States and the more serious crisis in Lower Canada. Bond Head was recalled in late 1837 and replaced with Sir George Arthur who arrived in Toronto in March 1838. Parliament also sent Lord Durham to become Governor- in-Chief of the British North American colonies,Lambton, John George, 1st Earl of Durham, in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, University of Toronto, Universit√© Laval, 2000 so that Arthur reported to Durham. Durham was assigned to report on the grievances among the British North American colonists and find a way to appease them. His report eventually led to greater autonomy in the Canadian colonies, and the union of Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada in 1840. The populations of Upper and Lower Canada are listed on the Province of Canada wiki, and that of Canada West was not to exceed that of Canada East until 1850. A number of the rebels were hanged including Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews, others were shot. Their deaths were a strong motivation for the continuing Patriot War. Many more prisoners were transported, but most were pardoned, e.g. Enoch Moore (Loyalist turned rebel). A general pardon (for everyone but Mackenzie) was issued in 1845, and Mackenzie himself was pardoned in 1849 and allowed to return to Canada, where he resumed his political career. Mackenzie was strongly disillusioned after his time in the United States, writing to his son that \\"after what I have seen here, I frankly confess to you that, had I passed nine years in the United States before, instead of after, the outbreak, I am sure I would have been the last man in America to be engaged in it.\\"Lindsey, Charles, The Life and Times of William Lyon Mackenzie and the Rebellion of 1837‚Äì38. 1862; cited by Betsy Dewar Boyce, The Rebels of Hastings, (1992) In later life however, Mackenzie advocated annexation of Canada by the United States.Lillian F. Gates, After the rebellion: the later years of William Lyon Mackenzie (1988) p 312 In total 93 Americans and 58 Canadiens prisoners from Lower Canada were transported to Australia after being convicted in Montreal in late 1838 or early 1839. Almost all were taken on HMS Buffalo, leaving Quebec in September 1839 and arriving off Hobart, Van Diemen's Land in February 1840. The Americans were disembarked at Hobart but the French-Canadians were taken to Sydney, New South Wales. They were interned near the present-day suburb of Concord, giving rise to the names Canada Bay, France Bay and Exile Bay. The French-Canadians were treated better than the Americans, liberated sooner and assisted in getting home. Of the 93 Americans, 14 died as a direct result of transportation and penal servitude. By the end of 1844, half of those in Van Diemen's Land had been granted pardons, nearly all were pardoned by 1848, but five remained in penal servitude until at least 1850. None chose to stay in Van Diemen's Land after being pardoned.A Guide to researching your convict ancestorsMagazine article about monument to French prisoners, and their story From Upper Canada 150 were sent to the penal colony of Van Diemen's Land and Sydney, Australia. In December 1838, more than a dozen convicts, amongst whom Grant, Miller, Reynolds, Parker, Malcolm, Walker, Bedford, Wixon, Watson, Brown, Anderson and Alves, were transferred through Liverpool, where those named interested in their case a local Member of Parliament, Joseph Hume, who brought an affidavit and petition of Habeas Corpus on their behalf. Grant had been sentenced in Niagara to death but pardoned if he would be transported. Miller and Reynolds were convicted in Niagara of felony to the same effect. The nine others were convicted in Toronto to the same effect. They depended, amongst other artifices, on the difference in status between convicted as they had been and pardoned by the time they were in Liverpool. But, in the end, the judges confirmed their transportation.State Trials (New Series) III, 963. Historical significance The Rebellion ‚Äì a \\"fact that every school child knows\\" ‚Äì has overshadowed all else in the Canadian narratives on the struggle for democracy and responsible government. Allan Greer has argued that \\"though the 'Progress of Liberty' was a favorite theme of history for earlier generations, it is difficult today to get anyone interested in the history of democracy‚Ä¶ Canadians in particular, taught in school to see their national past as a story dominated by transcontinental railways and Fathers of Confederation, have trouble imagining the struggle for democracy as an important historical theme. The history of democracy, we tend to believe, happened somewhere else.\\" Paul Romney explains this failure of historical imagination as the outcome of an explicit strategy adopted by reformers in the face of charges of disloyalty to Britain in the wake of the Rebellions of 1837. In recounting the ‚Äúmyths of responsible government‚Äù, Romney emphasized that after the ascendancy of Loyalism as the dominant political ideology of Upper Canada any demand for democracy or for responsible government became a challenge to colonial sovereignty. The linkage of the \\"fight for responsible government\\" with disloyalty was solidified by the Rebellion of 1837, as reformers took up arms to finally break the \\"baneful domination\\" of the mother country. Struggling to avoid the charge of sedition, reformers later purposefully obscured their true aims of independence from Britain and focused on their grievances against the Family Compact. Thus, responsible government became a \\"pragmatic\\" policy of alleviating local abuses, rather than a revolutionary anti-colonial moment.

President Franklin Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China were present. The declaration developed ideas from the 1941 Atlantic Charter, which was issued by the Allies of World War II to set goals for the post-war order. The Cairo Communiqu√© was broadcast through radio on December 1, 1943. The Cairo Declaration is cited in Clause Eight (8) of the Potsdam Declaration, which is referred to by the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.

The community is approximately 130 kilometers from Halifax Regional Municipality, 30 kilometers from Bridgewater and 25 kilometers from Lunenburg and now primarily a summer vacation and weekend getaway destination. Kingsburg features two large beaches, Hirtle's Beach and Kingsburg Beach. There is also a protected cape which features hiking trails called Gaff Point. Kingsburg has three large and two smaller ponds that are used for swimming. History King George lll issued a land grant of approximately 1350 acres to five foreign Protestant settlers, Leonard Hirtle, John Mossman, Peter Knack, Christian Hartman and John Kayser and Jacob Moser on July 5, 1787.Book 5,#53,page 45, Registry of Deeds, Municipality District of Lunenburg For many decades Kingsburg was mixed a fishing and farming community. By the mid twentieth century, with the widespread decline of small-scale Atlantic fishery, most fishing culture has disappeared. Economy Housebuilding is active in the community, with the first wave of construction buying and restoring older houses. With the landscape inspiring creative designers and hard working tradesmen, new custom homes with views have been created for buyers. The evolution of Kingsburg into a vacation and retirement destination has had an impact on the population of this remote village. Today the area attracts a premium for house and land prices compared to nearby communities. A lot of new ground and roads have been opened for future development though about 80% of the houses are vacant during most of the year. Much of the rural infrastructure for Upper and Lower Kingsburg is centered in Riverport, Nova Scotia. This includes Riverport Electric, the first municipal utility incorporated in Nova Scotia, the Riverport & District Fire Department, Riverport & District Community Center, Riverport Community School and Riverport Post Office. Rose Bay General Store offers a wide range of locally based goods and services. The best location for retail goods is Bridgewater, Nova Scotia and dining is available in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Culture Like many coastal communities on Nova Scotia's South Shore, Kingsburg has experienced major growth over the past 20 years.

A Macintosh version was released in 1994. The player controls Luigi, who must travel around the world to find and return stolen treasures as part of a quest to find his brother, Mario, who has been captured by Bowser. Mario Is Missing!, part of a series of educational Mario games, marked Luigi's second starring role in a video game, which would not occur again until 2001, when Luigi's Mansion was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Gameplay alt=A screenshot from Mario is Missing!. Mario Is Missing! is an educational game. The computer version is a point-and- click adventure game, while the NES and SNES versions have more of an emphasis on platforming. In the game, Bowser, king of the Koopas, has relocated from the Mushroom Kingdom to the real world, where he has set up his headquarters in an Antarctic castle. Bowser plans to steal the Earth's treasures with the use of the Passcode-Operated Remote Transportation and Larceny System (PORTALS), which allows his Koopas to teleport anywhere in the world. Bowser plans to sell the treasures to pay for enough hairdryers so he can melt the ice of Antarctica. Bowser captures Mario to prevent him from foiling the plan, and it is up to Mario's brother Luigi to save him. The player controls Luigi throughout the game. At the beginning of the game, Luigi and dinosaur Yoshi are at Bowser's castle, and Luigi has access to the PORTALS, allowing him to teleport to cities where the Koopas are operating. The player can view a map of the city that Luigi is in, as well as a map of the world that is known as the Globulator. The player can use the Globulator to control Yoshi's movements across the world, which is necessary to reunite Yoshi with Luigi. The player has access to a computer that keeps track of various clues learned throughout the game, including information gained from speaking to people in the cities Luigi visits and pamphlets regarding the landmarks that have had something stolen from them. Notable locations in the game include Cairo, New York City, Paris, and Tokyo. Missing artifacts include Big Ben, the Mona Lisa, and the Great Sphinx of Giza. Upon arriving in each city, the player must figure out what city Luigi is in and determine what artifact has been stolen and where it can be found; to figure these out, the player must talk to local people and ask them questions. Each city contains multiple tourist information centers, as well as three stolen treasures, which are obtained by dispatching the Koopa who is carrying each one. In the version for Macintosh PC and MS-DOS, the number of treasures that have to be retrieved from the Koopas in each city varies, ranging between three and five that need to be recovered and returned. The treasure must be taken to the correct tourist information center, where the attendant in charge of the center asks the player general questions about the artifact they are returning to ensure it is authentic. When the artifact is restored, a picture is taken of Luigi with the artifact and is placed into a photo album. The player must summon Yoshi to Luigi's current location so the dinosaur can eat a Pokey that is blocking the level exit leading back to Bowser's castle. Development and release To capitalize on educational games, which were popular at the time, Nintendo partnered with Radical Entertainment to create an educational Mario game. Nintendo licensed the Mario characters but was otherwise not involved in the game's development, nor was Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. The Software Toolworks released the game for MS-DOS in January 1993. Mario Is Missing! marked Luigi's first starring role in a video game, followed by Luigi's Mansion (2001) and Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon (2013). Nintendo later re-released the game for their own video game consoles. In the United States, The Software Toolworks had released the NES and SNES versions by June 1993. By October 1993, Mindscape had published said NES and SNES versions in Europe. The SNES version used audio and visual assets from Super Mario World. The DOS version uses stretched-out character animations, unlike the later versions. In the United States, The Software Toolworks released a Macintosh version on CD-ROM and floppy disks in June 1994, under the title Mario Is Missing! CD-Rom Deluxe. The new version included 127 QuickTime clips featuring 99 landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge and the Great Wall of China. Reception Due to the educational, rather than action-adventure content gamers of the time were used to, reception of the title was initially mixed. However, sales of the NES and SNES versions exceeded $7 million in profit for Software Toolworks during the second quarter of 1993. For contemporary reviews of the time, Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewed the SNES version; three of the magazine's four reviewers commented that the game is too slow and easy for experienced gamers, but that it offers great appeal to its young target audience while providing good educational value. Reviewers for GameFan praised the game's SNES version and compared it to Carmen Sandiego. Nintendo Power noted the game's \\"excellent\\" graphics. GamePro, reviewing the SNES version, called the game \\"a good way to learn geography\\", but wrote that players should not expect the game to be exciting. The magazine also noted that younger players would need help in progressing through the game. Nintendo Magazine System UK reviewed the SNES version and wrote that it succeeded as both an educational and entertaining game, but noted that it would only be suitable for people of a certain age. SNES Force criticized the graphics and the restricted gameplay, and noted that it was too easy for older players and too difficult for younger players. Total! wrote that the NES version was not as good as the SNES version, stating that it was missing \\"a bit of the graphical humour ‚Äì but it packs in almost as much game-play and educational value.\\" Chris Cavanaugh of AllGame reviewed the SNES version and considered it to be \\"somewhat enjoyable\\" for children, but believed that adult players would not be interested. Cavanaugh noted the colorful graphics, but criticized the repetitive gameplay and the \\"virtually identical\\" appearances of each city. AllGame's Skyler Miller reviewed the NES version and noted that the graphics were washed-out and lacking in detail, but stated that the overall game was \\"as good as can be expected\\" for an NES Mario game that was not created by Nintendo. Miller noted that the game should appeal to younger players because of its \\"relatively seamless\\" combination of instruction and action. Lisa Karen Savignano of AllGame reviewed the Macintosh version and considered it to be an enjoyable game with adequate graphics, but also stated that it was a simple game, noting that it was intended for young players. Savignano called the music \\"quite nice\\" but noted the basic sound effects and the lack of voiceovers. Critical consensus of the game has changed over time. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku wrote in 2012 that unlike the NES and SNES versions, the PC version \\"was the star, featuring not only more content but better visuals as well\\", although he also noted that the game was \\"awful\\" and not very educational. Kevin Wong of Kotaku noted in 2015 that the game was poorly received in many online reviews, although Wong himself praised the character animations and music, and wrote, \\"I think the backlash against Mario Is Missing comes down to measured expectations; what is suitable or primally engaging at a young age could be dull and tedious at another.\\" In 2016, Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer noted that the computer version had poor pixel art and that \\"every street has the exact same buildings on it, and all the NPCs are exactly the same no matter where I go.\\" Roberts also wrote that the game was \\"conceptually baffling and hated by Nintendo fans.\\" In 2017, Seth Macy of IGN included the game on a list of the \\"Weirdest Mario Games Ever Made\\", writing that the game's weirdest aspect \\"is how Bowser weaponizes climate change to melt the ice of Antarctica, flooding the Earth so he can steal landmarks.

The park is administered by the Parks Canada Agency. This \\"island of conservation\\" is located 35 km east of Edmonton, Alberta along the Yellowhead Highway, which goes through the park. It is Canada's eighth smallest in area but largest fully enclosed national park, with an area of . The park is representative of the northern prairies plateau ecosystem and as such, the knob and kettle landscape is a mix of native fescue grassland that has been converted to forage land dominated by non-native grasses, aspen parkland and boreal forest. As well, Elk Island plays host to both the largest and the smallest terrestrial mammals in North America, the wood bison and pygmy shrew respectively.  History  Elk Island National Park Elk Island National Park is situated in the Beaverhills area, which with its aspen thickets and easy access to water, has provided shelter for wintering herds of elk, bison and moose since times immemorial. Though there was never any permanent First Nations settlement in the area, there are over 200 archaeological remains of campsites and stone tool-making sites. The land has been influenced by the Blackfoot, Sarcee and Cree Aboriginal Canadians. In early post-Contact history, the Beaverhills area was primarily used for commercial hunting. This led to over-hunting and the virtual elimination of beaver from the area by the 1830s and of large ungulates by the 1860s. The area then became valuable for timber until 1894, when fire swept through the area. In 1899, the federal government designated the area the \\"Cooking Lake Forest Reserve\\". But while the forest was protected, it did little to protect the moose, elk and deer populations. Thus, in 1906, five men from Fort Saskatchewan put forward $5000 and petitioned the federal government to set up an elk sanctuary, calling it \\"Elk Park\\". Elk Island Park was later granted federal park status in 1913, and then designation as an official National Park under the National Parks Act which passed through the Canadian Parliament in 1930. In 1951, a replica of a pioneer cabin was built in the park to honour the Ukrainian Canadians who pioneered the area. This replica, known as the Ukrainian Pioneer Home, was the first museum or historic site ever dedicated to Ukrainian immigration in Canada. In 1993 it was declared a Classified Federal Heritage Building by the federal government.  Wildlife  Pelicans on Astotin Lake Elk Island is home to the densest population of ungulates (hoofed mammals) in Canada. A variety of mammal species including coyote, bison, moose, mule deer, lynx, beaver, elk, white-tailed deer, and porcupine are year-round residents. Black bears and timber wolves certainly roam within this park, but they are not commonly seen by wildlife viewers. Over two hundred and fifty bird species that can be found in the park at various times of year. Most notable among these are the red-necked grebes, American white pelicans, double-crested cormorants, great blue herons, red-tailed hawks, American bitterns and the trumpeter swans. Elklake.jpgAstotin Lake = Wildlife management = Elk Island National Park maintains a thriving elk population, estimated at 605 in 2007, as well as around 300 moose and over 500 deer. Parks Canada transferred eighteen moose from Elk Island to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Highlands National Park between 1947 and 1948. Reintroduction of traditional species has been an important focus as well. Besides the success of the wood and plains bison introduction, beavers were reintroduced in 1942, and in 2007 numbered near 1000. 1987 saw the beginning of a Trumpeter Swan reintroduction program me which is now seeing mating pairs returning to Elk Island, raising hope for a sustainable population. Elk Island National Park also remains a seed herd for repopulation efforts in other areas. Elk Island elk have been relocated to various parts North America, including Ontario and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Plains bison have been reintroduced to conservation areas scattered throughout their historic domain, for example American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana, Grasslands National Park and the Old Man on His Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area in Saskatchewan, and in 2006, 30 wood bison were relocated to the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) to begin repopulation efforts of the area historically inhabited by the now extinct steppe bison. = Bison conservation = Bison in the Elk Island National Park Elk Island National Park has a prominent history in large ungulate conservation. As early as 1907, the Canadian government bought one of the last and largest remaining pure-bred plains bison, the Pablo-Allard herd, from Montana. Close to 400 bison were shipped to Elk Island as a temporary waystation until the fencing at Buffalo Park in Wainwright was completed. In 1909 the fence was finished and 325 bison were relocated to Buffalo National Park. However, 40-70 bison evaded capture and became the ancestors of today's herd in Elk Island National Park. In 2007, Parks Canada maintained a herd of about 450 plains bison in Elk Island. When the Bison number over this amount they are sold. The proceeds of the sales go to help finance the needs of national parks. In the late 19th century, only 300 wood bison remained worldwide, almost exclusively in Wood Buffalo National Park. During the 1920s, 6000-7000 plains bison were also relocated to Wood Buffalo National Park. These bison were not only infected with brucellosis and tuberculosis, which infected the wood bison herd, but the wood and plains subspecies also interbred, and thus it was thought that wood bison were completely extinct by the 1940s. In 1957, however, a disease-free, not fully but relatively pure wood bison herd of 200 was discovered near Nyarling river in Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park and remain there today as the most genetically pure wood bison remaining. In 2007, the wood bison population in Elk Island National Park was estimated at 315. Elk Island has become famous for exporting its ungulates to other conservation areas around North America, and even to Russia. In 1996 elk were sent to Land Between The Lakes National Recreation Area in Kentucky. Starting in 2005, a series of plains bison deliveries were made to the American Prairie Reserve in northeastern Montana, including 94 head in 2010 and 72 in 2012. Three groups of 30 wood bison were sent to the Republic of Sakha, in the Russian Federation, partly to replace the extinct steppe bison in the habitat but also a protection against any disease wiping out the North American herd of that species. Conservationists transferred fifty-three wood bison from this national park to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in June 2008. They were absent from Alaskan boreal forests for nearly one hundred years.https://www.alaskawildlife.org/wood-bison-restoration/  Climate   Activities and facts  Elk Island National Park is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, year round.

It was first published by McClelland and Stewart in 2000. Set in Canada, it is narrated from the present day, referring to previous events that span the twentieth century. The work was awarded the Man Booker Prize in 2000 and the Hammett Prize in 2001 and also received a number of other nominations. Plot summary The novel's protagonist, Iris Chase, and her sister Laura, grow up well-off but motherless in a small town in southern Ontario. As an old woman, Iris recalls the events and relationships of her childhood, youth and middle age, including her unhappy marriage to Toronto businessman Richard Griffen. The book includes a novel within a novel, a roman √† clef attributed to Laura but published by Iris. It is about Alex Thomas, a politically radical author of pulp science fiction who has an ambiguous relationship with the sisters. That embedded story itself contains a third tale, the eponymous Blind Assassin, a science fiction story told by Alex's fictional counterpart to the second novel's protagonist, believed to be Laura's fictional counterpart. The novel takes the form of a gradual revelation illuminating both Iris's youth and her old age before coming to the pivotal events of her and Laura's lives around the time of the Second World War. Laura and Iris live in a house called Avilion. Their mother dies at a young age leaving Reenie, the caretaker, to take on full responsibility for the girls. As the novel unfolds, and the novel-within-a-novel becomes ever more obviously inspired by real events, Iris, not Laura, is revealed to be the novel-within-a-novel's true author and protagonist. Though the novel-within-a-novel had long been believed to be inspired by Laura's romance with Alex, it is revealed that The Blind Assassin was written by Iris based on her extramarital affair with Alex. Iris later published the work in Laura's name after Laura committed suicide upon learning of Alex's death in the war. Following the suicide, Iris realizes through her sister's journals that Richard had been raping Laura for much of their marriage, blackmailing her to comply with him by threatening to turn Alex in to the authorities. Iris takes her young daughter Aimee and flees her home, threatening to reveal that Richard had impregnated Laura and forced an abortion on her. This move estranges Iris from the last people who were supporting her, and creates bitterness between her and the grown Aimee. Iris deceives Richard into believing that Laura was the one having an affair with Alex Thomas, which drives him to commit suicide. The novel ends as Iris dies, leaving the truth to be discovered in her unpublished autobiography that she leaves to her sole surviving granddaughter. The book is set in the fictional Ontario town of Port Ticonderoga and in the Toronto of the 1930s and 1940s. It is a work of historical fiction with the major events of Canadian history forming an important backdrop. Greater verisimilitude is given by a series of newspaper articles commenting on events and on the novel's characters from a distance. Main characters * Iris Chase Griffen: The narrator and protagonist of the tale. * Laura Chase: Iris's sister, whose suicide opens the book and who is named as the author of the novel within. * Richard E.

Reception Reception was mixed. A reviewer for Salon described the book as a \\"cunning tale ... sketched with Atwood's trademark dark humor and deft hand.\\" The Christian Science Monitor critic commented on \\"Atwood's crisp wit and steely realism\\" and said the book \\"brilliantly ... works to flesh out the dime-novel culture of the 1930s and to emphasize the precarious position of women.\\" The New York Times critic Thomas Mallon was unimpressed, calling the book \\"overlong and badly written\\". Adam Mars-Jones in The Guardian was less negative but characterized the book as a \\"romantic tale\\" with political elements bolted on. The novel was awarded the Booker Prize in 2000 and the Hammett Prize in 2001. It was also nominated for Governor General's Award in 2000, Orange Prize for Fiction, and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2002.

At the time of the book's writing in the mid-1930s, Rommel's rank was lieutenant colonel. Rommel had planned to write a successor called Panzer greift an (in English: Tank Attacks) about tank warfare, and gathered much material during the North Africa Campaign. However, he was forced to commit suicide before completing this work. Overview Rommel describes his Sto√ütruppen (shock troops) tactics, which used speed, deception, and deep penetration into enemy territory to surprise and overwhelm. Throughout the book, Rommel reports assigning small numbers of men to approach enemy lines from the direction in which attack was expected. The men would yell, throw hand grenades and otherwise simulate the anticipated attack from concealment, while attack squads and larger bodies of men sneaked to the flanks and rears of the defenders to take them by surprise. These tactics often intimidated enemies into surrendering, thus avoiding unnecessary exertion, expenditure of ammunition, and risk of injury. =Contents= The text is divided into six chapters: *I.

Pursuit of Tagliamento and Piave Translations In 1943, an abridged version titled, more simply, Attacks! was released by the US military for officers' tactical study. The first full English translation was published in 1944 by The Infantry Journal in the United States. The translator was Lieutenant Colonel Gustave E. Kidde without permission from Rommel, according to the foreword to the 1995 edition published by Stackpole Books. Impact Infanterie greift an was first published in 1937 and helped to persuade Adolf Hitler to give Rommel high command in World War II, although he was not from an old military family or the Prussian aristocracy, which had traditionally dominated the German officer corps. It was printed in Germany until 1945. By then, about 500,000 copies had been published. The book is still in print, and was most recently published in German in 2015. The book was also used throughout the West as a resource for infantry tactical movements. General George S. Patton was among the many influential military leaders reported to have read Infantry Attacks.Patton, G. S. : War As I Knew It, page 166. Mariner Books, 1995. In popular culture In the 1970 film Patton, when it is clear to Patton that he is defeating forces he believes are commanded by Rommel during a tank battle, Patton says to himself, \\"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\\" However, in a previous scene in the film, Patton is awoken by his aides with news that an intercepted German radio message reveals that Rommel will attack Patton near El Guettar, Tunisia. Before this, the camera focuses on a book on Patton's nightstand, The Tank in Attack (Panzer greift an), a book which Rommel had planned to write but never completed. It is clear that the unwritten book is what the film is referring to, and not Infanterie greift an.

Shakespeare's Desdemona is a Venetian beauty who enrages and disappoints her father, a Venetian senator, when she elopes with Othello, a Moorish man several years her senior. When her husband is deployed to Cyprus in the service of the Republic of Venice, Desdemona accompanies him. There, her husband is manipulated by his ensign Iago into believing she is an adulteress, and, in the last act, she is murdered by her estranged spouse. The role has attracted notable actresses through the centuries and has the distinction of being the first role performed professionally by Margaret Hughes, the first actress to appear on an English public stage.  Sources  Desdemona Cursed by her Father (Desdemona maudite par son p√®re) by Eug√®ne Delacroix, Brooklyn Museum Othello has its source in the 1565 tale, \\"Un Capitano Moro\\" in Gli Hecatommithi by Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio. While no English translation of Cinthio was available in print during Shakespeare's lifetime, it is possible that Shakespeare knew both the Italian original, Gabriel Chappuy's 1584 French translation, and an English translation in manuscript. Cinthio's tale may have been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508. The only named character in Cinthio's story is \\"Disdemona\\". The name derives from Greek , which means \\"ill-fated, unfortunate\\", i.e. the antonym of Eudaimonia. L√©one Teyssandier notes that it may indeed be how Othello views his wife, calling her an \\"ill-starred wench\\". The other characters are identified only as the Moor, the ensign, the ensign's wife, and the squadron leader. In the original, the ensign lusts after Disdemona and is spurred to revenge when she rejects him. Unlike Shakespeare's Othello, the Moor in Cinthio's story never repents the murder of his wife. Both he and the ensign escape immediate prosecution but are killed much later. Cinthio also drew a moral (which he placed in the mouth of the lady) that European women are unwise to marry the temperamental males of other nations. While Shakespeare followed Cinthio's tale very closely in composing Othello, he deviated significantly in some details. He invented Desdemona's father, Brabantio, and her dissolute Venetian admirer, Roderigo. He invented the entire first act in which Iago arouses Brabantio's prejudices against Othello, and Desdemona defends her choice of husband before Venice's Doge. Shakespeare considerably expanded the role of Cinthio's ensign's wife. In Cinthio, she is simply Disdemona's companion but in Shakespeare she becomes Desdemona's attendant and confidante. In Cinthio, the ensign filches Disdemona's handkerchief from a sash at her waist; his wife is not involved in the mischief as is Shakespeare's Emilia. Later, Cinthio's ensign's wife learns of her husband's villainy in the handkerchief deception but feels constrained to remain silent. Unlike Shakespeare's Emilia, Cintho's ensign's wife lives to tell what she knows of Disdemona's death long after her husband and the Moor are dead. Disdemona's death in Cinthio is strikingly different from Desdemona's death in Shakespeare. The poet's gentle scene between Desdemona and Emilia while preparing for bed does not exist in Cinthio, and Cinthio's murder of Disdemona is accomplished when the Moor commissions his ensign to bludgeon Disdemona to death with a sand-filled stocking. The two murderers then place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and cause the cracked ceiling of the room to collapse upon her, giving the impression that the lady's skull was smashed by falling rafters.  Role in Othello  Othello and Desdemona in Venice by Th√©odore Chass√©riau (1819‚Äì1856) In the play's first act, Desdemona has eloped with Othello, a Moor in the service of the Venetian Republic. Before the Duke of Venice, his councilmen, and her father, she proclaims her love for Othello and defends her choice. Her father reluctantly accepts the union but warns Othello that she will someday deceive him. When Othello is sent to Cyprus in the line of duty, Desdemona accompanies him with his ensign's wife, Emilia attending her. In act 2, Othello's lieutenant, Cassio is disgraced in a brawl and falls from Othello's favor. Iago suggests to Cassio that he importune Desdemona to intercede for him, which she does. Meanwhile, Iago persuades Othello that Desdemona has formed an illicit relationship with Cassio. However many critics argue that the first seed of doubt is not issued from Iago but by Desdemona's father: It is Desdemona's assurance and confidence in the honor and strength of the love she bears for Othello that inspires her boldness. Yet the passion of her love both arouses and unnerves her husband too, adding to the seeds of fear and suspicion. When Emilia's husband Iago sees Desdemona's handkerchief, he steals it and forbids Emilia to disclose its whereabouts to Desdemona. Iago plants the article in Cassio's room. Eventually, Othello sees Cassio with the handkerchief and accepts it as confirmation of Desdemona's infidelity. Rodolfo Amoedo ‚Äì Desdemona Desdemona is concerned over the loss of the handkerchief but maintains that its loss will not cause Othello to grow angry. Emilia is more cynical, especially after Othello violently asks to see it. Desdemona is confused over her husband's behavior, which culminates in his striking her in public and calling her a whore. Desdemona is deeply upset by her husband's attacks but continues to assert her love. In the final act, Othello tells her that he knows she has been unfaithful, and is going to kill her. Despite Desdemona's claims of innocence, Othello refuses to believe her, and when he tells her that Cassio has been killed, Desdemona cries out. Othello becomes enraged and smothers Desdemona, ignoring her pleas for mercy. When her maid Emilia rushes into the room, Desdemona rises weakly to defend Othello, then dies. Eventually, Othello learns of Desdemona's faithfulness after Emilia exposes Iago's true nature before being stabbed to death by Iago, and out of complete remorse, Othello commits suicide, but only after angrily stabbing Iago (though not fatally) as retribution for his lies against Desdemona. Desdemona's cousin Lodovico then orders that Iago be tortured and executed.  Cuts in performance  Desdemona's banter with Iago and Emilia at their arrival in Cyprus (2.1.100ff) has been traditionally regarded as distasteful and cut on moral and artistic grounds, being deemed unworthy of a noble tragedy such as Othello and out of character for Desdemona. Today, however, the purpose of the passage is sometimes viewed as a depiction of Desdemona's awareness of the way of the world, and her persistence in pursuing the exchanges as a characteristic innocent overconfidence displayed elsewhere in the play (3.3.41‚Äì83, 3.4.90ff).  Performance history  On 8 December 1660, Thomas Killigrew's new King's Company performed Othello at their Vere Street theatre, with Margaret Hughes as Desdemona ‚Äì possibly the first time a professional actress appeared on a public stage in England. She played Desdemona in the performance of Othello seen by Samuel Pepys on 6 February 1669. Pepys was present for a performance of Othello at the Cockpit on 11 October 1660, noting in his diary: \\"a pretty lady that sat by me called out to see Desdemona smothered.\\"Shakespeare, William. Four Tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth. Bantam Books, 1988. In the eighteenth century, the play was sometimes cut to heighten the tragic nobility of the protagonist. Bell's acting version, for example, omitted several moments including Desdemona's conversation with Emilia before her death‚Äîa death which is accomplished in Bells' version by stabbing rather than strangulation. Dante Gabriel Rossetti: Desdemona's Death Song In the nineteenth century, behind- the-scenes events in the lives of the play's performers garnered for Othello a shocking and sensational reputation. Charles Kean, for example, suffered a bitter divorce in 1825, and, in 1833, collapsed following a performance of the play, dying shortly thereafter. Edwin Forrest filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery only to be found guilty himself and ordered to pay alimony. Ira Aldridge, an American black actor who appeared in the role, married a white woman. Such events cultivated the play's shocking and sensational reputation, and Tommaso Salvini's savage and sensual performance only enhanced it. In his rendition, Desdemona's death was an especially violent affair. Further cultivating the drama's reputation were the performances of Sarah Siddons, Anna Mowatt, and Ellen Terry who all played the melodramatic role of womanly innocence traduced and overwhelmed to the hilt. In 1839, Samuel Phelps and William Charles Macready alternated in the roles of Othello and Iago at the Haymarket Theatre with Helen Faucit in the role of Desdemona. In 1881, Ellen Terry performed the role at London's Lyceum Theatre with Edwin Booth and Henry Irving alternating in the roles of Othello and Iago. The production was a great artistic and financial success. In the twentieth century, Peggy Ashcroft played the character opposite Paul Robeson in London's Savoy Theatre in 1930, and Uta Hagen appeared in the role opposite Robeson in Margaret Webster's production at the Shubert Theatre in New York City in 1943. = Cinema = Suzanne Cloutier as Desdemona in Orson Welles' 1952 film, Othello In a 1951 film version, Suzanne Cloutier played Desdemona opposite Orson Welles. The film won the grand prize Palme d'Or at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival. In a 1966 British film version, Maggie Smith played the character opposite Laurence Olivier. The film holds the record for the most Academy Award nominations given to a Shakespeare film adaptation. Maggie Smith and co-stars Olivier, Frank Finlay (Iago), and Joyce Redman (Emilia) all received acting nominations. In a 1995 film version, Ir√®ne Jacob played the character opposite Laurence Fishburne. There have been numerous screen modernisations of the play. During 1999 Edinburgh Film Festival, Adil Hussain, cast as Othello, fell in love with Kristen Jain, who was playing Desdemona. He ended up tightly hugging her, much to her and the audience's shock, instead of \\"killing\\" her as per the script, thus forcing the curtains to be brought down immediately. They eventually got married eight years later, in 2007. In O (2001), Julia Stiles played a character based on Desdemona in a version of Othello set in a contemporary high school. A 2001 British made-for-television film featuring Keeley Hawes as Desdemona \\"Dessie\\" Brabant also updates the action, picturing John Othello (Eamonn Walker) and Ben Jago (Christopher Eccleston) as high ranking Metropolitan Police officers. In 2006, Omkara, a Bollywood version of Othello, Dolly Mishra (Desdemona) was played by Kareena Kapoor.

Mao sought to remove reactionary elements within the bureaucracy of the Communist Party of China, saying that \\"governance is also a process of socialist education.\\" The People's Republic Of China: III Chinese researchers have pointed out the movement resulted in at least 77,560 deaths, with 5,327,350 people being persecuted.

Goals  The goal of the movement was to cleanse politics, economy, organization, and ideology (the four cleanups). It was to last until 1966. What this movement entailed was that intellectuals were sent to the countryside to be re-educated by peasants. They still attended school, but also worked in factories and with peasants.  Aftermath  The campaign is described by Donald Klein in the Encyclopedia Americana 2007 (Grolier Online), as a \\"nearly complete failure.\\" Mao's dissatisfaction over this program's inefficacy set the stage for the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).

The latter have longer amino acid chain lengths than the former. These hormones have an effect on the endocrine system of animals, including humans.K. Siddle, J. C. Hutton, Peptide Hormone Secretion/Peptide Hormone Action: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press, 1991, . Most hormones can be classified as either amino acid‚Äìbased hormones (amine, peptide, or protein) or steroid hormones. The former are water-soluble and act on the surface of target cells via second messengers; the latter, being lipid-soluble, move through the plasma membranes of target cells (both cytoplasmic and nuclear) to act within their nuclei. Like all protein and proteins, peptide hormones and protein hormones are synthesized in cells from amino acids according to mRNA transcripts, which are synthesized from DNA templates inside the cell nucleus. Preprohormones, peptide hormone precursors, are then processed in several stages, typically in the endoplasmic reticulum, including removal of the N-terminal signal sequence and sometimes glycosylation, resulting in prohormones. The prohormones are then packaged into membrane-bound secretory vesicles, which can be secreted from the cell by exocytosis in response to specific stimuli (e.g. an increase in Ca2+ and cAMP concentration in cytoplasm). J. C. Hutton, Peptide Hormone Secretion: A Practical Approach, Hull University Press, 1991, . These prohormones often contain superfluous amino acid residues that were needed to direct folding of the hormone molecule into its active configuration but have no function once the hormone folds. Specific endopeptidases in the cell cleave the prohormone just before it is released into the bloodstream, generating the mature hormone form of the molecule. Mature peptide hormones then travel through the blood to all of the cells of the body, where they interact with specific receptor on the surfaces of their target cells. Some neurotransmitters are secreted and released in a similar fashion to peptide hormones, and some \\"neuropeptides\\" may be used as neurotransmitters in the nervous system in addition to acting as hormones when released into the blood. When a peptide hormone binds to a receptor on the surface of the cell, a second messenger appears in the cytoplasm, which triggers signal transduction leading to the cellular responses.C. G. Wermuth, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Academic Press, 2003, . Some peptide/protein hormones (angiotensin II, basic fibroblast growth factor-2, parathyroid hormone-related protein) also interact with intracellular receptors located in the cytoplasm or nucleus by an intracrine mechanism.William J.

He served briefly in the state of Cao Wei, founded by Cao Cao's successor Cao Pi, in the early Three Kingdoms period before his death. Formerly a subordinate of other warlords such as Ding Yuan, Dong Zhuo and L√º Bu, Zhang Liao joined Cao Cao around 198 after L√º Bu's downfall at the Battle of Xiapi. Since then, he participated in many of Cao Cao's military campaigns, including those against Yuan Shao's heirs and the Wuhuan tribes from 201‚Äì207. He is best known for his pivotal role in the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford in 214‚Äì215, in which he successfully defended Hefei from the forces of the warlord Sun Quan.

When Cao Cao was preparing to attack the enemy in Liucheng (Êü≥Âüé; present-day Xingcheng, Liaoning), Zhang Liao warned him that Jing Province's Governor Liu Biao take advantage of his absence from Xu to send Liu Bei to attack Xu and take control of the capital. However, Cao Cao felt that Liu Biao would not send Liu Bei to attack Xu because he did not trust Liu Bei, so he proceeded with the campaign against Yuan Shang and the Wuhuan.(ÂÇÖÂ≠êÊõ∞ÔºöÂ§™Á•ñÂ∞áÂæÅÊü≥ÂüéÔºåÈÅºË´´Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§´Ë®±ÔºåÂ§©Â≠ê‰πãÊúÉ‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂ§©Â≠êÂú®Ë®±ÔºåÂÖ¨ÈÅ†ÂåóÂæÅÔºåËã•ÂäâË°®ÈÅ£ÂäâÂÇôË•≤Ë®±ÔºåÊìö‰πã‰ª•Ëôü‰ª§ÂõõÊñπÔºåÂÖ¨‰πãÂã¢ÂéªÁü£„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÁ≠ñË°®ÂøÖ‰∏çËÉΩ‰ªªÂÇôÔºåÈÅÇË°å‰πü„ÄÇ) Fu Zi annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 17.

In common sense, refractory period is the characteristic recovery time, a period that is associated with the motion of the image point on the left branch of the isocline \\\\dot{u} = 0 (for more details, see also Reaction‚Äìdiffusion and Parabolic partial differential equation). electrophysiological recording of an action potential showing the various phases that occur as the wave passes a point on a cell membrane. In physiology, a refractory period is a period of time during which an organ or cell is incapable of repeating a particular action, or (more precisely) the amount of time it takes for an excitable membrane to be ready for a second stimulus once it returns to its resting state following an excitation. It most commonly refers to electrically excitable muscle cells or neurons. Absolute refractory period corresponds to depolarization and repolarization, whereas relative refractory period corresponds to hyperpolarization.  Electrochemical usage  After initiation of an action potential, the refractory period is defined two ways: The absolute refractory period coincides with nearly the entire duration of the action potential. In neurons, it is caused by the inactivation of the Na+ channels that originally opened to depolarize the membrane. These channels remain inactivated until the membrane hyperpolarizes. The channels then close, de-inactivate, and regain their ability to open in response to stimulus. The relative refractory period immediately follows the absolute. As voltage-gated potassium channels open to terminate the action potential by repolarizing the membrane, the potassium conductance of the membrane increases dramatically. K+ ions moving out of the cell bring the membrane potential closer to the equilibrium potential for potassium. This causes brief hyperpolarization of the membrane, that is, the membrane potential becomes transiently more negative than the normal resting potential. Until the potassium conductance returns to the resting value, a greater stimulus will be required to reach the initiation threshold for a second depolarization. The return to the equilibrium resting potential marks the end of the relative refractory period.  Cardiac refractory period  Effective Refractory Period The refractory period in cardiac physiology is related to the ion currents that, in cardiac cells as in nerve cells, flow into and out of the cell freely. The flow of ions translates into a change in the voltage of the inside of the cell relative to the extracellular space. As in nerve cells, this characteristic change in voltage is referred to as an action potential. Unlike that in nerve cells, the cardiac action potential duration is closer to 100 ms (with variations depending on cell type, autonomic tone, etc.). After an action potential initiates, the cardiac cell is unable to initiate another action potential for some duration of time (which is slightly shorter than the \\"true\\" action potential duration). This period of time is referred to as the refractory period, which is 250ms in duration and helps to protect the heart. In the classical sense, the cardiac refractory period is separated into an absolute refractory period and a relative refractory period. During the absolute refractory period, a new action potential cannot be elicited. During the relative refractory period, a new action potential can be elicited under the correct circumstances. The cardiac refractory period can result in different forms of re-entry, which are a cause of tachycardia. Vortices of excitation in the myocardium (autowave vortices) are a form of re-entry. Such vortices can be a mechanism of life- threatening cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, the autowave reverberator, more commonly referred to as spiral waves or rotors, can be found within the atria and may be a cause of atrial fibrillation.  Neuronal refractory period  The refractory period in a neuron occurs after an action potential and generally lasts one millisecond. An action potential consists of three phases. Phase one is depolarization. During depolarization, voltage-gated sodium ion channels open, increasing the neuron's membrane conductance for sodium ions and depolarizing the cell's membrane potential (from typically -70 mV toward a positive potential). In other words, the membrane is made less negative. After the potential reaches the activation threshold (-55 mV), the depolarization is actively driven by the neuron and overshoots the equilibrium potential of an activated membrane (+30 mV). Phase two is repolarization. During repolarization, voltage-gated sodium ion channels inactivate (different from the closed state) due to the now-depolarized membrane, and voltage-gated potassium channels activate (open). Both the inactivation of the sodium ion channels and the opening of the potassium ion channels act to repolarize the cell's membrane potential back to its resting membrane potential. When the cell's membrane voltage overshoots its resting membrane potential (near -60mV), the cell enters a phase of hyperpolarization. This is due to a larger- than-resting potassium conductance across the cell membrane. This potassium conductance eventually drops and the cell returns to its resting membrane potential. The refractory periods are due to the inactivation property of voltage-gated sodium channels and the lag of potassium channels in closing. Voltage-gated sodium channels have two gating mechanisms, the activation mechanism that opens the channel with depolarization and the inactivation mechanism that closes the channel with repolarization. While the channel is in the inactive state, it will not open in response to depolarization. The period when the majority of sodium channels remain in the inactive state is the absolute refractory period. After this period, there are enough voltage- activated sodium channels in the closed (active) state to respond to depolarization. However, voltage-gated potassium channels that opened in response to repolarization do not close as quickly as voltage-gated sodium channels; to return to the active closed state. During this time, the extra potassium conductance means that the membrane is at a higher threshold and will require a greater stimulus to cause action potentials to fire. In other words, because the membrane potential inside the axon becomes increasingly negative relative to the outside of the membrane, a stronger stimulus will be required to reach the threshold voltage, and thus, initiate another action potential. This period is the relative refractory period.  Skeletal muscle refractory period The muscle action potential lasts roughly 2‚Äì4 ms and the absolute refractory period is roughly 1‚Äì3 ms, shorter than other cells.

Structure =Bachelor of Commerce= The Bachelor of Commerce degree is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business (see aside). Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their major, students are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance, economics, actuarial studies, business management, human resources and marketing; some programs also require business statistics and -calculus, and information systems. Depending on the institution, a formal academic major may or may not be established. Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others. For a comparison with other business degrees, see Business education#Undergraduate education. =Honours Bachelor of Commerce= The Honours Bachelor of Commerce (BCom (Hons) or BComm (Hons) or HBCom or HBComm) is further advanced. It may consist of a four-year program or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a three-year Bachelor's degree. The degree requires additional academic courses to be completed with higher academic performance standards and may also require a researched thesis component. The degree has a specialization aspect, analogous to the BBA; the one-year program is typically focused exclusively on a single subject-area. The Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree often serves as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate programs, including the Master of Commerce (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees. =Duration= The curriculum generally lasts three years in Australia, New Zealand, India, Malta, South Africa, some parts of Canada and Hong Kong. The curriculum requires four years of study in the Republic of Ireland, the majority of Canada, Ghana, the Philippines and the Netherlands. In Nepal, the duration of the program can be three years. In South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and some universities in India, the BCom (Hons) degree is considered an additional postgraduate qualification, whereas in Malta, an additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification. In Pakistan, the BCom/AD Commerce degree lasts two years, the BCom (Hons) degree lasts three years, and a four-year program leads to the BS (Hons) Commerce degree. History The Bachelor of Commerce degree was first offered at the University of Birmingham. The University's School of Commerce was founded by William Ashley, an Englishman from Oxford University, who was the first professor of Political Economy and Constitutional History in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Toronto. Ashley left Toronto in 1892, spent a few years at Harvard University, and then went back to England to the new University of Birmingham where he founded the School of Commerce. Ashley began the program which was the forerunner of many other BCom degree programs throughout the British Empire. Eighteenth-century economists had divided the English economy into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Commerce included the transportation, marketing and financing of goods. The Birmingham program in commerce included economic geography, economic history, general economics, modern languages, and accountancy.

Usage In Canada, the Netherlands and other places the Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) is equivalent to the Bachelor of Engineering, and is classified as a professional degree. In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree. In the United States, it is also considered a highly specialized professional technical degree; the Bachelor of Applied Science is an applied baccalaureate, typically containing advanced technical training (e.g. military training) in sciences combined with liberal arts that traditional degrees do not have. All the general education courses are valid courses if taken at accredited universities and colleges that have regional accreditation. Hence, an earned BAS degree does include having to take upper-division coursework as required in addition to traditional bachelor's degree programs. The Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree is designed to grow professional management skills of the learner and meet the demand for leadership of highly technical professionals in the workplace. A Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree requires an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree, a minimum of 4 years of professional development or additional classes in an approved field, professional certifications or approved military training, and 2 years of upper level college courses. This degree takes longer than a basic traditional degree because of the specialized technical skill level and professional development requirements. Most people who pursue this degree are already experienced professional adults who are working towards an advanced graduate degree or interested in upward mobility in their field. The AAS is historically considered a technical degree in the United States. An accredited AAS degree is a 2 to 3-year degree that articulates well with advanced academics and/or approved technical programs. A high school diploma and entry level testing is necessary for college acceptance. The AAS provides opportunities for advanced learning through 4-year undergraduate studies in approved fields that will transfer to an accredited BAS program. On 20 February 2009 the Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Ronald Plasterk, proposed to replace all the existing degrees offered by Dutch vocational universities, such as the BBA, BEd and BEng, with the BAA and the BASc. But, the BAS has taken the official degree term in the United States. The Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degrees are designed to enhance the occupational/technical education provided by an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) or Associate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree program. Fields of study The BAS usually requires a student to take a majority of their courses in the applied sciences, specializing in a specific area such as the following: * Agricultural systems * Applied physics * Applied mathematics * Architectural science * General engineering * Automotive engineering * Building Arts * Biological engineering * Biochemical engineering * Built Environment * Business informatics * Chemical engineering * Civil engineering * Computer science * Computer engineering * Communication * Construction Management * Criminal justice * Criminology * Electrical engineering * Environmental engineering * Geomatics * Occupational health and safety * Public health * Engineering management * Engineering physics * Engineering science * Engineering science and mechanics * Geological engineering * Hospitality Management * Industrial engineering * Information management * Integrated engineering * Information systems * Information technology * Management engineering * Management of technology * Manufacturing engineering * Manufacturing Management * Materials science & engineering * Mechanical engineering * Mechanical engineering technology * Mechatronics engineering * Mining engineering * Microbiology * Nanotechnology engineering * Nutrition and Food * Paralegal Studies * Forensics * Astrophysics * Professional Technical Teacher Education * Project Management * Property and Valuation * Software engineering * Sound engineering * Surveying * Sustainable building science technology * Systems engineering * Regional and Urban Planning * Applied physics & electronic engineering * Business management * Social science * Leadership See also * Bachelor of Applied Arts * Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences * Bachelor of Arts * Bachelor of Science * Bachelor of Science in Information Technology * Bachelor's degree References Bachelor's degrees ","title":"Bachelor of Applied Science"},{"id":"248401","title":"Huntsville, Ontario"},{"id":"248410","text":"Minister of State is a title borne by politicians or officials in certain countries governed under a parliamentary system. In some countries a 'Minister of State' is a junior minister, who is assigned to assist a specific cabinet minister. In other countries a 'Minister of State' is a holder of a more senior position, such as a cabinet minister or even a head of government. High government ranks In several national traditions, the title \\"Minister of State\\" is reserved for government members of cabinet rank, often a formal distinction within it, or even its chief. *Australia: Section 64 of the Commonwealth constitution empowers the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, to appoint Ministers of State 'to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish'. Junior ministers may not be responsible for an entire department, but may serve under a senior minister who is so responsible, with the junior Minister administering a particular area of policy. For example, the Minister for Sport is responsible for sport within the Department of Health and Ageing, which is in turn administered by the Minister for Health and Ageing. *Brazil: Minister of State () is the title borne by all members of the Federal Cabinet. *Kenya: A Minister of State generically refers to a more senior minister by virtue of the revenue power, or security implications of their ministry. For instance, ministries housed under the Office of the President, Office of the Deputy President and Office of the Prime Minister are titled as \\"Ministries of State for\\". Actual examples include Ministry of State for Internal Security and Provincial Administration; Ministry of State for Immigration; and Ministry of State for Public Service. *France: Under the Fifth Republic, Minister of State (Ministre d'√âtat in French) is an honorific title bestowed upon nomination as a Minister. Ministres d'√âtat, in the protocol, rank after the Prime Minister and before the other Ministers but enjoy no other specific prerogatives. Initially, the title of Ministres d'√âtat didn't explicitly include a portfolio (a practice common under previous regimes), although in time both the title and a specific portfolio have since normally been conferred together. As under previous regimes, a series of Ministres d'√âtat in the same cabinet may also reflect a balance between the different political trends in the ruling party (or within the ruling coalition). A Ministre d'√âtat is not to be confused with a Secretary of State (Secr√©taire d'√âtat), a Junior minister assisting a Minister and who may only attend cabinet meeting if the topic discussed touches his responsibilities. Former Ministres d'√âtat include former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. *Japan: Minister of State is the title borne by all members of the Japanese Cabinet. *Luxembourg: Minister of State (French: Ministre d'√âtat; Luxembourgish and German: Staatsminister) is an additional title borne by the Prime Minister. Unlike the title 'Prime Minister' (French: Premier ministre; Luxembourgish: Premier; German: Premierminister), which was instituted only in 1989, that of Minister of State has been held by the head of government since 1848. As Minister of State, his role is to control and coordinate the activities of the other Ministers. *Monaco: The Minister of State of Monaco is the Principality's head of government, appointed by and subordinate to the Prince of Monaco and responsible for enforcing its laws. *Portugal: Minister of State (Ministro de Estado) is a member of the Council of Ministers who holds a more distinct position within the cabinet, roughly equivalent to Deputy prime minister. *Spain: When Adolfo Su√°rez was Prime Minister, Ministers of State were created who held a more distinct position within the Government. However, this initiative did not last since his successors did not follow this path. *Scandinavian states: The equivalent title statsminister is used for the head of government (i.e. the prime minister), and compound titles of which -minister is a part may be used for major-portfolio Ministers. For details on statsminister, see Prime Minister of Sweden, Prime Minister of Denmark, Prime Minister of Norway, and Prime Minister of Finland. *United Kingdom: Normally a mid-level government role (see next section) but Lord Beaverbrook was nominally Minister of State from 1 May 1941 to 29 June 1941 while a member of the war cabinet. Senior Ministers of State can be invited to attend cabinet on a regular basis at the Prime Minister's discretion, though they are not technically full members. Minor government ranks In various nations, especially in former members of the British Empire, \\"Minister of State\\" is a junior ministerial rank, often subordinated to a cabinet member. *Australia: The Special Minister of State is a ministerial position in the Australian Government, sometimes a Cabinet position, responsible for parliamentary, electoral, oversight and other affairs. *Canada: A Minister of State is senior to a Secretary of State but junior to a Minister of the Crown (ordinary portfolio minister). *Germany: Minister of State (Staatsminister in German) is the title given to a parliamentary state secretary (a member of parliament serving as a political aide to a cabinet minister) serving in the Foreign Office or the Chancellor's Office. Accordingly, Minister of State ranks between a State Secretary and a Federal Minister. It is also used as the title of cabinet ministers of certain German states. Historically, the same title was used (sometimes alternating with other styles), notably as head of government in certain of the many constituent monarchies of pre-reunion Germany, e.g. in Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Lippe, Schaumburg-Lippe, in Hannover, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Reuss-Schleiz-Gera and Principality of Reuss-Greiz, Kingdom of Saxony, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg- Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. *India: A Minister of State is a junior minister in the Council of Ministers in the Union Government who may assist a cabinet minister or have independent charge of a ministry. The Constitution of India restricts the number of ministers of state in the federal government. A Minister of State with independent charge is a minister without an overseeing Cabinet Minister in the State or Union Government of India. He himself is in charge of his ministry, unlike Minister of State who is also a Minister but assists a cabinet minister. Moreover, such ministers can take part in cabinet meetings on important issues unlike Ministers of state who does not take any part in any cabinet meetings. *Ireland: A Minister of State is junior to a Minister of a Department of State (portfolio minister) and of similar standing to a Parliamentary Secretary. *Nigeria: A Minister of State is a junior Minister in the Nigerian Cabinet and is normally the principal deputy or one of the deputies to the Minister in a Federal Ministry. The Minister of State may in some cases be the head of a special department in the President's Office. By law, both senior Ministers and Ministers of State are regarded as Ministers of the Government of the Federation. *Pakistan: Like in other former British colonies, a Minister of State in Pakistan is a junior Minister in the national Government who may assist a cabinet minister or have independent charge of a ministry.Pakistan Federal Cabinet *Sri Lanka: A Minister of State (or State Minister) is a non-cabinet minister of the executive branch of the Government of Sri Lanka, as such is junior to a Cabinet Minister but senior to a Deputy Minister. *Singapore: Ministers of State and Senior Ministers of State are members of the executive branch of the Government of Singapore, senior in rank to Parliamentary Secretaries and Senior Parliamentary Secretaries, but junior to full Cabinet Ministers. *United Kingdom: A Minister of State is a member of Her Majesty's Government, junior only to a Secretary of State but senior to a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and Parliamentary Private Secretaries (PPSs). Ministers of State are responsible to their Secretaries of State. The role in this context has existed only since 1945 (see above for exception in the case of Beaverbrook) ‚Äì previously, each parliamentary under-secretary was directly beneath a secretary of state. There can be more than one Minister of State at any government Department. Ministers of State may have departmental PPSs, or a PPS might be assigned to them. Of a similar standing to Ministers of State are positions such as the Solicitor General, the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, Treasurer of the Household, Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, Paymaster General, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Economic Secretary to the Treasury. Ministers of State are bound by the Ministerial Code. Subnational office In the republic of Burma, the title was used for the Chief ministers of the following autonomous states, from 1947/48 till the abolition of that autonomy in 1962: Arakan State (Rakhine), Chin State, Kayin State (Kayin), Kayah State (Karenni), Kachin State and Shan State Other uses =Netherlands and Belgium= In the Netherlands (Minister van Staat in Dutch) and Belgium (also Ministre d'√âtat in French), Ministers of State is a title of honour awarded formally by the Monarch, but on the initiative of the government. It is given on a personal basis, for life rather than for a specified period. The title is granted for exceptional merits, generally to senior politicians at the end of their party career. Ministers of state are often former cabinet members or party leaders. Ministers of State advise the Sovereign in delicate situations, with moral authority but without formal competence. In Belgium they are entitled to a seat, alongside the members of the government in power, in the Crown Council; to date the Crown Council has been convened on only five occasions, the first being in 1870 for the Franco-Prussian War, and the latest in 1960 in connection with the independence of the Belgian Congo. Apart from that, the only privileges of being a \\"minister of state\\" are protocollary precedence on state occasions and a ministerial car registration number. De facto, appointments tend to respect the almost obsessional balances between the Flemish and French-speaking communities as well as between the 'ministeriable' political families: mainly Christian-democrats, Socialists, Liberals, also (moderate) Nationalists, occasionally an Ecologist). Other former careers include those of √âtienne Davignon (European Commissioner) and Luc Coene (prime-ministerial Kabinetschef, roughly Chief of staff). In January 2006 the number of ministers of state reached 51 with Johan Vande Lanotte, shortly after he laid down his portfolio and title of Vice-Prime Minister to head the Flemish Socialist SP.A party. After formateur Yves Leterme returned his commission in August 2007, King Albert II consulted 13 Ministers of State individually, without convening the crown council as such. In both countries, junior ministers are called State Secretary (staatssecretaris or secr√©taire d'√©tat), similarly to France. Some State Secretaries may, in specific circumstances, style themselves as Minister (not Minister of State) when visiting a foreign country. =New Zealand= * To bestow a sinecure -- the role has been given to senior figures who did not occupy positions of leadership, but who were held in high esteem or who were wanted in Cabinet. For example, a former Prime Minister might be appointed Minister of State as an \\"elder statesman\\" -- this was the purpose for which New Zealand Prime Minister Rob Muldoon originally created the position in 1975. * To create a sort of junior minister -- using this office, politicians can be appointed to associate roles without having a substantive ministerial role of their own. There is no formal rank of \\"assistant minister\\" or \\"deputy minister\\" in New Zealand, but if someone is a full minister, they can be assigned to an associate role helping a different full minister. Someone appointed Minister of State is technically a full minister and can thus be assigned associate roles, thereby creating a type of minister whose only effective authority is as an associate minister. The first Minister of State in New Zealand was Keith Holyoake, a former Prime Minister. Other prominent people to have held the office include Jim Bolger and Robin Gray (a former Prime Minister and a former Speaker, respectively). Examples of people who held the office simply in order that they might be appointed as associate ministers include Mita Ririnui, Damien O'Connor, and Dover Samuels. =Ancien R√©gime fran√ßais= In France during the Ancien R√©gime and Bourbon Restoration, the title \\"Ministre d'√âtat\\" had a specific designation. The title first appeared under Louis XIII. The \\"ministres d'√âtat\\", appointed by lettres patentes, attended meetings of the Conseil du Roi (which would later become the Conseil d'√âtat). From 1661 on ‚Äî at the start of Louis XIV's \\"personal reign\\" ‚Äî the king called whomever he wished to his Council; invitations were only good for one session and needed to be renewed as long as the individual retained the king's confidence. However, having attended one session of the Council gave the person the right to be called \\"ministre d'√âtat\\" for life, and also gave him the right to an annual life pension of roughly 20,000 livres. There were few \\"ministres d'√âtat\\" at Council meetings (between three or four during the reign of Louis XIV); they also attended the \\"Conseil des D√©p√™ches\\" (the \\"Council of Messages\\", concerning notices and administrative reports from the provinces). Suppressed during the French Revolution, the title \\"ministre d'√âtat\\" reappeared during the Bourbon Restoration as essentially an honorary title given (not systematically) to Ministers after their demission or their departure from office; refusal on behalf of the King to award this title to a demissioned Minister was seen as an affront. =British diplomacy= From 28 January 1944, the last two British Ministers Resident in the Middle East, concerned with former British protectorate Egypt, were styled Ministers of State in the Middle East.

The town was built around a waterfall on the Muskoka River in the centre of town, and is known for its other nearby waterfalls (Wilson's Falls, High Falls, etc.). It was first incorporated in 1875. The town is the seat of the district government, a centre of tourism for the Muskoka area, and home to several historical sites, such as the Clock Tower, Woodchester Villa, and the Silver Bridge, which joins Manitoba Street with Ecclestone Drive. The Silver Bridge was repaired in 2002. Graydon Smith is the current mayor. History Bracebridge and Muskoka River circa 1880 View down Manitoba Street in Bracebridge circa 1910 The character of the town of Bracebridge is shaped by its proximity to Lake Muskoka to which it is connected by 6 miles of the Muskoka River, and by the promise of abundant water power afforded by the great waterfall at the foot of the downtown. Early growth of the town occurred in proximity to the falls which powered the first factory. The arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway cemented the town's role as a transportation hub for the area. Modern settlement of the town began in the 1860s, beginning at first with a few log huts. The Muskoka colonization road had been completed to the first falls on the north branch of the Muskoka River by 1862. Entrepreneurs began to take advantage of the area's water power. With the advent of steamship service on Lake Muskoka a few years later, Bracebridge prospered as the main distribution centre for the region. By 1869, Bracebridge was a village with a population of 160 in the Township of Macaulay, Victoria County. (In 1868 Macauley and six additional townships had been detached from the County and transferred to the new District of Muskoka, but were not withdrawn for municipal purposes until 1877.) The village was established on the Muskoka River. There were stages in winter and boats in summer from Barrie to Washago. The average price of wild land was $2 to $5 an acre while improved land was $10 per acre.The province of Ontario gazetteer and directory. H. McEvoy Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869 By 1870 the village had a population of about 400, growing to reach a total of about 2,000 by the turn of the 20th century. The village was incorporated in 1875 and became a town under an Act of Parliament in 1889. In 1894 Bracebridge became the first town in Ontario to have its own hydro generating station. In 1971 Macaulay Township was merged into Bracebridge. The municipal boundaries of Bracebridge also encompass the smaller communities of Clear Lake, Falkenburg (ghost town), Falkenburg Station, Fraserburg, Germania, Lakewood, Matthiasville, Monsell (ghost town), Purbrook, Rocksborough, Springdale Park, Stoneleigh, Uffington and Vankoughnet. Transportation The Bracebridge Town Express 'trolley' Bracebridge is immediately adjacent to Highway 11, a major provincial highway that connects the community to Greater Toronto in under 2 hours, as well as to markets in Northern Ontario. Muskoka Airport, which serves general aviation and scheduled flights from Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, is located 5 km south of Bracebridge. While rail service to Bracebridge has been discontinued, the community is serviced by coach bus line that departs from the Bracebridge Quality Inn and takes passengers south to Toronto and north to North Bay. In 2016 the municipality launched Bracebridge Transit, a one-hour, single-route schedule that gets residents around the urban core. Bracebridge Mobility also offers door-to-door service to individuals who are unable to access the regular transit service due to mobility issues. Climate Education Bracebridge is served by several elementary schools and two high schools: Bracebridge and Muskoka Lakes Secondary School, and Saint Dominic Catholic Secondary School. Public education is administered by the Trillium Lakelands District School Board, and Catholic education is administered by the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board. Georgian College operates a satellite campus in the town with programming that supports the local labour market. Nipissing University operated in Bracebridge for over 21 years but chose to consolidate its operations in 2016 resulting in the closure of the local campus. The facility was purchased in 2018 by Dewey College, an independent high school registered with the Ontario Ministry of Education that offers international students a range of programs from high school to ESL and AP programs. Demographics Sports The Town of Bracebridge built a Sportsplex in 2006 which contains a rock climbing wall, indoor track, eight- lane swimming pool and fitness studio. The town partnered with the Muskoka Limberettes Gymnastics Club to create a gymnastics facility in the same building. The Sportsplex is part of the same complex including the Bracebridge and Muskoka Lakes Secondary School and Rene M. Caisse Memorial Theatre.\\"A Trip Around Lake Muskoka With Norman Bethune - And A Cure For Cancer\\", by Martin Avery, 2013, Bracebridge also opened a new 3.75 Million dollar softball venue called Peake Fields at Verena Acres. This facility supports a Men's League, Women's League, and Minor Ball, as well as slow pitch. The Men's fastball League has been running for some 35 years, and has produced 4 Ontario Intermediate Fastball Championships, and 3 Canadian Championships, with all local players. Plans are currently in place for a new Arena/Fieldhouse/Library complex that is now currently under construction. Attractions and venues Bracebridge is the home of Santa's Village, a Christmas theme park, established in 1955. It was inspired by the town's location at 45 degrees latitude, halfway between the equator and the North Pole. In 2016, Bracebridge held its first annual Fire and Ice Festival. Media Bracebridge is served by the local radio stations CFBG-FM and CJMU-FM. Local newspapers include Bracebridge Examiner, District Weekender, Muskoka Sun and Muskoka Advance. The first newspaper in Bracebridge was the Northern Advocate begun in 1870 by Thomas McMurray. It was joined in 1872 by the Free Grant Gazette owned by E.F. Stephenson. The Advocate ceased publication in 1874 and was bought out by Stephenson. Competition resumed, however, in 1878 when Mr Gaffe and Mr Oaten founded the Muskoka Herald.

In a seven-decade career, he has recorded over sixty albums as a leader. A number of his compositions, including \\"St. Thomas\\", \\"Oleo\\", \\"Doxy\\", \\"Pent-Up House\\", and \\"Airegin\\", have become jazz standards. Rollins has been called \\"the greatest living improviser\\" and the \\"Saxophone Colossus\\". Early life Rollins was born in New York City to parents from the United States Virgin Islands. The youngest of three siblings, he grew up in central Harlem and on Sugar Hill, receiving his first alto saxophone at the age of seven or eight. He attended Edward W. Stitt Junior High School and graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. Rollins started as a pianist, changed to alto saxophone, and finally switched to tenor in 1946. During his high school years, he played in a band with other future jazz legends Jackie McLean, Kenny Drew, and Art Taylor. Later life and career =1949‚Äì1956= After graduating from high school in 1947, Rollins began performing professionally; he made his first recordings in early 1949 as a sideman with the bebop singer Babs Gonzales (trombonist J. J. Johnson was the arranger of the group). Within the next few months, he began to make a name for himself, recording with Johnson and appearing under the leadership of pianist Bud Powell, alongside trumpeter Fats Navarro and drummer Roy Haynes, on a seminal \\"hard bop\\" session. In early 1950, Rollins was arrested for armed robbery and spent ten months in Rikers Island jail before being released on parole; in 1952, he was re-arrested for violating the terms of his parole by using heroin. Between 1951 and 1953, he recorded with Miles Davis, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Charlie Parker, and Thelonious Monk. A breakthrough arrived in 1954 when he recorded his famous compositions \\"Oleo\\", \\"Airegin\\", and \\"Doxy\\" with a quintet led by Davis that also featured pianist Horace Silver, these recordings appearing on the album Bags' Groove. In 1955, Rollins entered the Federal Medical Center, Lexington, at the time the only assistance in the U.S. for drug addicts. While there, he volunteered for then- experimental methadone therapy and was able to break his heroin habit, after which he lived for a time in Chicago, briefly rooming with the trumpeter Booker Little. Rollins initially feared sobriety would impair his musicianship, but then went on to greater success. Rollins briefly joined the Miles Davis Quintet in the summer of 1955.Richard Cook. It's About That Time: Miles Davis on and off Record. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. , pp. 45.Lewis Porter. John Coltrane: His Life and Music. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1999. , p. 98. Later that year, he joined the Clifford Brown‚ÄìMax Roach quintet; studio albums documenting his time in the band are Clifford Brown and Max Roach at Basin Street and Sonny Rollins Plus 4. After the deaths of Brown and the band's pianist, Richie Powell, in a June 1956 automobile accident, Rollins continued playing with Roach and began releasing albums under his own name on Prestige Records, Blue Note, Riverside, and the Los Angeles label Contemporary. His widely acclaimed album Saxophone Colossus was recorded on June 22, 1956, at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in New Jersey, with Tommy Flanagan on piano, former Jazz Messengers bassist Doug Watkins, and his favorite drummer, Roach. This was Rollins's sixth recording as a leader and it included his best-known composition \\"St. Thomas\\", a Caribbean calypso based on a tune sung to him by his mother in his childhood, as well as the fast bebop number \\"Strode Rode\\", and \\"Moritat\\" (the Kurt Weill composition also known as \\"Mack the Knife\\"). A long blues solo on Saxophone Colossus, \\"Blue 7\\", was analyzed in depth by the composer and critic Gunther Schuller in a 1958 article. In the solo for \\"St. Thomas\\", Rollins uses repetition of a rhythmic pattern, and variations of that pattern, covering only a few tones in a tight range, and employing staccato and semi-detached notes. This is interrupted by a sudden flourish, utilizing a much wider range before returning to the former pattern. (Listen to the music sample.) In his book The Jazz Style of Sonny Rollins, David N. Baker explains that Rollins \\"very often uses rhythm for its own sake. He will sometimes improvise on a rhythmic pattern instead of on the melody or changes.\\"Baker, David N (1983). The Jazz Style of Sonny Rollins: A Musical and Historical Perspective. Alfred Music (Van Nuys, CA). . p. 14. Ever since recording \\"St. Thomas\\", Rollins's use of calypso rhythms has been one of his signature contributions to jazz; he often performs traditional Caribbean tunes such as \\"Hold 'Em Joe\\" and \\"Don't Stop the Carnival,\\" and he has written many original calypso-influenced compositions, such as \\"Duke of Iron,\\" \\"The Everywhere Calypso,\\" and \\"Global Warming.\\" In 1957 he married the actress and model Dawn Finney. In 1956 he also recorded Tenor Madness, using Davis's group ‚Äì pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. The title track is the only recording of Rollins with John Coltrane, who was also a member of Davis's group. At the end of the year Rollins appeared as a sideman on Thelonious Monk's album Brilliant Corners and also recorded his own first album for Blue Note Records, entitled Sonny Rollins, Volume One, with Donald Byrd on trumpet, Wynton Kelly on piano, Gene Ramey on bass, and Roach on drums. =1957‚Äìspring 1959= In 1957, Rollins pioneered the use of bass and drums, without piano, as accompaniment for his saxophone solos,Ratliff, Ben. \\"Sonny Rollins Strips for Action.\\" New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast). Sep 16 2007. ProQuest. Web. 13 Aug. 2014. a texture that came to be known as \\"strolling.\\" Two early tenor/bass/drums trio recordings are Way Out West and A Night at the Village Vanguard, both recorded in 1957. Way Out West was so named because it was recorded for California-based Contemporary Records (with Los Angeles drummer Shelly Manne), and because it included country and western songs such as \\"Wagon Wheels\\" and \\"I'm an Old Cowhand\\". The Village Vanguard album consists of two sets, a matinee with bassist Donald Bailey and drummer Pete LaRoca and an evening set with bassist Wilbur Ware and drummer Elvin Jones. Rollins used the trio format intermittently throughout his career, sometimes taking the unusual step of using his sax as a rhythm section instrument during bass and drum solos. Lew Tabackin cited Rollins's pianoless trio as an inspiration to lead his own. Joe Henderson, David S. Ware, Joe Lovano, Branford Marsalis, and Joshua Redman have also led pianoless sax trios. While in Los Angeles in 1957, Rollins met alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman and the two of them practiced together. Coleman, a pioneer of free jazz, stopped using a pianist in his own band two years later. By this time, Rollins had become well known for taking relatively banal or unconventional songs (such as \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" on Work Time, \\"Toot, Toot, Tootsie\\" on The Sound of Sonny, and later \\"Sweet Leilani\\" on the Grammy- winning album This Is What I Do) and using them as vehicles for improvisation. Rollins acquired the nickname \\"Newk\\" because of his facial resemblance to Brooklyn Dodgers star pitcher Don Newcombe.Liner notes Nucleus (1975) Sonny Rollins at the San Francisco Opera House, February 22, 1982 In 1957 he made his Carnegie Hall debut and recorded again for Blue Note with Johnson on trombone, Horace Silver or Monk on piano and drummer Art Blakey (released as Sonny Rollins, Volume Two). That December, he and fellow tenor saxophonist Sonny Stitt were featured together on Dizzy Gillespie's album Sonny Side Up. In 1958, he appeared in Art Kane's A Great Day in Harlem photograph of jazz musicians in New York; he is one of only two surviving musicians from the photo (the other being Benny Golson). The same year, Rollins recorded another landmark piece for saxophone, bass and drums trio: Freedom Suite. His original sleeve notes said, \\"How ironic that the Negro, who more than any other people can claim America's culture as his own, is being persecuted and repressed; that the Negro, who has exemplified the humanities in his very existence, is being rewarded with inhumanity.\\" The title track is a nineteen-minute improvised bluesy suite; the other side of the album features hard bop workouts of popular show tunes. Oscar Pettiford and Max Roach provided bass and drums, respectively. The LP was available only briefly in its original form, before the record company repackaged it as Shadow Waltz, the title of another piece on the record. Following Sonny Rollins and the Big Brass (Sonny Rollins Brass/Sonny Rollins Trio), Rollins made one more studio album in 1958, Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders, before taking a three-year break from recording. This was a session for Contemporary Records and saw Rollins recording an esoteric mixture of tunes including \\"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody\\" with a West Coast group made up of pianist Hampton Hawes, guitarist Barney Kessel, bassist Leroy Vinnegar and drummer Manne. In 1959 he toured Europe for the first time, performing in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and France. =Summer 1959‚Äìfall 1961: The Bridge= By 1959, Rollins had become frustrated with what he perceived as his own musical limitations and took the first ‚Äì and most famous ‚Äì of his musical sabbaticals. While living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, he ventured to the pedestrian walkway of the Williamsburg Bridge to practice, in order to avoid disturbing a neighboring expectant mother. Today, a fifteen-story apartment building named \\"The Rollins\\" stands on the Grand Street site where he lived. Almost every day from the summer of 1959 through the end of 1961, Rollins practiced on the bridge, next to the subway tracks. Rollins admitted that he would often practice for 15 or 16 hours a day, no matter what season.Frequently Asked Questions, Sonnyrollins.com In the summer of 1961, the journalist Ralph Berton happened to pass by the saxophonist on the bridge one day and published an article in Metronome magazine about the occurrence. During this period, Rollins became a dedicated practitioner of yoga. Rollins ended his sabbatical in November 1961. He later said \\"I could have probably spent the rest of my life just going up on the bridge. I realized, no, I have to get back into the real world.\\" In 2016, a campaign was initiated that seeks to have the bridge renamed in Rollins's honor. =Winter 1961‚Äì1969: Musical explorations= In November 1961, Rollins returned to the jazz scene with a residency at the Jazz Gallery in Greenwich Village; in March, 1962, he appeared on Ralph Gleason's television series Jazz Casual. During the 1960s, he lived on Willoughby Street in Brooklyn, New York. He named his 1962 \\"comeback\\" album The Bridge at the start of a contract with RCA Victor. Produced by George Avakian, the disc was recorded with a quartet featuring guitarist Jim Hall, Ben Riley on drums, and bassist Bob Cranshaw. This became one of Rollins's best-selling records; in 2015 it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Rollins's contract with RCA Victor lasted through 1964 and saw him remain one of the most adventurous musicians around. Each album he recorded differed radically from the previous one. The 1962 disc What's New? explored Latin rhythms. On the album Our Man in Jazz, recorded live at The Village Gate, he explored avant-garde playing with a quartet that featured Cranshaw on bass, Billy Higgins on drums and Don Cherry on cornet. He also played with a tenor saxophone hero, Coleman Hawkins, and free jazz pianist Paul Bley on Sonny Meets Hawk!, and he re-examined jazz standards and Great American Songbook melodies on Now's the Time and The Standard Sonny Rollins (which featured pianist Herbie Hancock). In 1963, he made the first of many tours of Japan. In 2007, recordings from a 1965 residency at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club were released by the Harkit label as Live in London; they offer a very different picture of Rollins' playing from the studio albums of the period. (These are unauthorized releases, and Rollins has responded by \\"bootlegging\\" them himself and releasing them on his website.) Upon signing with Impulse! Records, he released a soundtrack to the 1966 film Alfie, as well as There Will Never Be Another You and Sonny Rollins on Impulse! After East Broadway Run Down (1966), which featured trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones, Rollins did not release another studio album for six years. In 1968, he was the subject of a television documentary (in the series Creative Persons), directed by Dick Fontaine, entitled Who is Sonny Rollins? =1969‚Äì1971: Second sabbatical= In 1969, Rollins took another two-year sabbatical from public performance. During this hiatus period, he visited Jamaica for the first time and spent several months studying yoga, meditation, and Eastern philosophies at an ashram in Powai, India, a district of Mumbai. =1971‚Äì2000= Sonny Rollins performing in 2005 He returned from his second sabbatical with a performance in Kongsberg, Norway, in 1971. Reviewing a March 1972 performance at New York's Village Vanguard night club, The New Yorker critic Whitney Balliett wrote that Rollins \\"had changed again. He had become a whirlwind. His runs roared, and there were jarring staccato passages and furious double-time spurts. He seemed to be shouting and gesticulating on his horn, as if he were waving his audience into battle.\\"Whiney Balliett, Collected Works: A Journal of Jazz 1954-2001 St. Martin's Press, 2001, p. 762. The same year, he released Next Album and moved to Germantown, New York. Also in 1972, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in composition. During the 1970s and 1980s, he also became drawn to R&B;, pop, and funk rhythms. Some of his bands during this period featured electric guitar, electric bass, and usually more pop- or funk- oriented drummers. In 1974, Rollins added jazz bagpiper Rufus Harley to his band; the group was filmed performing live at Ronnie Scott's in London. For most of this period Rollins was recorded by producer Orrin Keepnews for Milestone Records (the compilation Silver City: A Celebration of 25 Years on Milestone contains a selection from these years). In 1978 he, McCoy Tyner, Ron Carter, and Al Foster toured together as the Milestone Jazzstars. In June of that year he joined many other major jazz artists in a performance for President Jimmy Carter on the South Lawn of the White House. It was also during this period that Rollins' passion for unaccompanied saxophone solos came to the forefront. In 1979 he played unaccompanied on The Tonight Show and in 1985 he released The Solo Album, recorded live at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He also frequently played long, extemporaneous unaccompanied cadenzas during performances with his band; a prime example is his introduction to the tune \\"Autumn Nocturne\\" on the 1978 album Don't Stop the Carnival. By the 1980s, Rollins had stopped playing small nightclubs and was appearing mainly in concert halls or outdoor arenas; through the late 1990s he occasionally performed at large New York rock clubs such as Tramps and The Bottom Line. He added (uncredited) sax improvisations to three tracks by the Rolling Stones for their 1981 album Tattoo You, including the single, \\"Waiting on a Friend\\" and the long jam \\"Slave\\". That November, he led a saxophone masterclass on French television. In 1983, he was honored as a \\"Jazz Master\\" by the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1986, documentary filmmaker Robert Mugge released a film titled Saxophone Colossus. It featured two Rollins performances: a quintet concert at Opus 40 in upstate New York and a performance with the Yomiuri Shimbun Orchestra in Japan of his Concerto for Saxophone and Symphony, a work composed in collaboration with the Finnish pianist and composer Heikki Sarmanto. In 1993, the Sonny Rollins International Jazz Archives opened at the University of Pittsburgh. New York City Hall proclaimed November 13, 1995, to be \\"Sonny Rollins Day.\\" Several days later, Rollins gave a performance at New York City's Beacon Theatre that reunited him with musicians with whom he played as a teenager, including McLean, Walter Bishop Jr., Percy Heath, Connie Henry, and Gil Coggins. In 1997, he was voted \\"Jazz Artist of the Year\\" in the Down Beat magazine critics' poll. The following year, Rollins, a dedicated advocate of environmentalism, released an album entitled Global Warming.Phillip Lutz, \\"An Environmental Benefit, Set to the Jazz of Sonny Rollins\\", The New York Times, November 27, 2009. =2001‚Äì2012= Rollins at Newport Jazz Festival in 2008 Critics such as Gary Giddins and Stanley Crouch have noted the disparity between Rollins the recording artist, and Rollins the concert artist. In a May 2005 New Yorker profile, Crouch wrote of Rollins the concert artist: Rollins won a 2001 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album for This Is What I Do (2000).GRAMMY Award Winners accessed September 29, 2009 On September 11, 2001, the 71-year- old Rollins, who lived several blocks away, heard the World Trade Center collapse, and was forced to evacuate his Greenwich Street apartment, with only his saxophone in hand. Although he was shaken, he traveled to Boston five days later to play a concert at the Berklee School of Music. The live recording of that performance was released on CD in 2005 as Without a Song: The 9/11 Concert, which won the 2006 Grammy for Jazz Instrumental Solo for Rollins' performance of \\"Why Was I Born?\\" Rollins was presented with a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2004; that year also saw the death of his wife, Lucille. In 2006, Rollins went on to complete a Down Beat Readers Poll triple win for: \\"Jazzman of the Year\\", \\"#1 Tenor Sax Player\\", and \\"Recording of the Year\\" for the CD Without a Song: The 9/11 Concert. The band that year featured his nephew, trombonist Clifton Anderson, and included bassist Cranshaw, pianist Stephen Scott, percussionist Kimati Dinizulu, and drummer Perry Wilson. Sonny Rollins at Stockholm Jazz Festival 2009 After a successful Japanese tour Rollins returned to the recording studio for the first time in five years to record the Grammy-nominated CD Sonny, Please (2006). The CD title is derived from one of his wife's favorite phrases. The album was released on Rollins' own label, Doxy Records, following his departure from Milestone Records after many years and was produced by Anderson. Rollins' band at this time, and on this album, included Cranshaw, guitarist Bobby Broom, drummer Steve Jordan and Dinizulu. During these years, Rollins regularly toured worldwide, playing major venues throughout Europe, South America, the Far East, and Australasia; he is estimated to have sometimes earned as much as $100,000 per performance. On September 18, 2007, he performed at Carnegie Hall in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of his first performance there. Appearing with him were Anderson (trombone), Bobby Broom (guitar), Cranshaw (bass), Dinizulu (percussion), Roy Haynes (drums) and Christian McBride (bass). Around 2000, Rollins began recording many of his live performances; since then, he has archived recordings of over two hundred and fifty concerts. To date, four albums have been released from these archives on Doxy Records and Okeh Records: Road Shows, Vol. 1; Road Shows, Vol. 2 (with four tracks documenting his 80th birthday concert, which included Rollins's first ever recorded appearance with Ornette Coleman on the twenty-minute \\"Sonnymoon for Two\\"); Road Shows, Vol. 3; and Holding the Stage, released in April 2016. In 2010 Rollins was awarded the National Medal of Arts and the Edward MacDowell Medal; in the fall of the same year he celebrated his 80th birthday with a concert at New York's Beacon Theatre that included a guest appearance by Ornette Coleman. The following year he was the subject of another documentary by Dick Fontaine, entitled Beyond the Notes. Rollins has not performed in public since 2012, due to recurring respiratory issues. =2013‚Äìpresent= In 2013, Rollins moved to Woodstock, New York. That spring, he made a guest television appearance on The Simpsons in \\"Whiskey Business\\" and received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Juilliard School in New York City. In 2014 he was the subject of a Dutch television documentary entitled Sonny Rollins-Morgen Speel ik Beter. He made a public appearance in June of that year introducing saxophonist Ornette Coleman at an all-star tribute performance to Coleman in Brooklyn, NY. In October 2015, he received the Jazz Foundation of America's lifetime achievement award. In the spring of 2017, Rollins donated his personal archive to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, one of the research centers of New York Public Library. Later that year, he endowed the \\"Sonny Rollins Jazz Ensemble Fund\\" at Oberlin College, in \\"recognition of the institution's long legacy of access and social justice advocacy.\\" Sonny Rollins was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Influences As a saxophonist he had initially been attracted to the jump and R&B; sounds of performers like Louis Jordan, but soon became drawn into the mainstream tenor saxophone tradition. The German critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt described this tradition as sitting between the two poles of the strong sonority of Coleman Hawkins and the light flexible phrasing of Lester Young, which did so much to inspire the fleet improvisation of bebop in the 1950s. Other tenor saxophone influences include Ben Webster and Don Byas. By his mid-teens, Rollins became heavily influenced by alto saxophonist Charlie Parker. During his high school years, he was mentored by the pianist and composer Thelonious Monk, often rehearsing at Monk's apartment. Instruments Rollins has played, at various times, a Selmer Mark VI tenor saxophone and a Buescher Aristocrat. During the 1970s he recorded on soprano saxophone for the album Easy Living. His preferred mouthpieces are made by Otto Link and Berg Larsen. He uses Frederick Hemke medium reeds.

It is located approximately south of Bracebridge, Ontario. Mayor Paul Kelly was . The Town of Gravenhurst includes a large area of the District of Muskoka, known to Ontarians as \\"cottage country.\\" The town centre borders on two lakes: Lake Muskoka, which is the largest lake in the region, and Gull Lake, a smaller cottage-bordered lake. Another lake, Kahshe Lake, is situated south of the town. History Opera House in Gravenhurst Gravenhurst was first known as McCabes Landing and later as Sawdust City. Gravenhurst was named by a postal official who was reading Gravenhurst or Thoughts on Good and Evil, a treatise by William Smith. Gravenhurst's economic prosperity stemmed from the construction of a colonization road in the 1850s. Steamboating on the Muskoka lakes began in the 1860s. The town was located strategically at the northern terminus of the Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway. The town is positioned as the \\"Gateway to Muskoka\\". Nearby Muldrew Lake was named after the lake's second cottager, Dr. William Hawthorne Muldrew. He was the principal of the first Gravenhurst high school in 1894. In 1901 he published a book called Sylvan Ontario, A Guide to Our Native Trees and Shrubs. It was the first book published on this subject in Ontario, and the drawings were his own. All the different types of trees and shrubs of Muskoka could be seen at the school, as he transplanted many of the specimens from Muldrew Lake. In 1942 the Royal Norwegian Air Force moved their training camp (Little Norway) from Toronto to Muskoka airfield near Gravenhurst. The Norwegians remained in Gravenhurst almost to the end of World War II in 1945.Per Conradi Hansen, Little Norway - A message of Liberty to the Hills of Home, From 1940 to 1946 Gravenhurst was the site of Camp XX, the Gravenhurst Internment Camp, for Nazi Prisoners of War, known locally as \\"the Muskoka officers club\\". Before the war it was the Calydor Sanitarium. After the war it was turned into a TB sanitarium, again, and later became a kosher resort called The Gateway. =Camp 20= Between 1940 and 1946 Gravenhurst was home to a German prisoner- of-war camp known as Camp 20. The camp is also referred to as Camp Calydor and Muskoka Officer‚Äôs Club. Many describe Camp 20 as a vacation for the prisoners of war. The camp had a swimming area fenced in on Lake Muskoka where the prisoners could bathe. By the end of the first summer, Camp 20 held 489 prisoners. They were taken around Gravenhurst to work on various projects. The prisoners of war built a set of stone steps leading down to the waterfront which can still be seen at Gull Lake Park today. They also built a light house in the park. The camp had its own gardens where the prisoners would grow their own vegetables and they were able to smoke sausages from the local animals. Some prisoners of war said that they became friends with the guards who sought to make the place as friendly as possible to avoid escapes. Many prisoners had the opportunity to work outside of the camp and lumber camps and received a small wage as well as access to the outside world. Through this access to the outside world many German prisoners of war had love affairs with the local girls. Ulrich Steinhilper, a German fighter ace who shot down five RAF airplanes during the Battle of Britain before himself being shot down, was one of the prisoners here; he made at least five attempts to escape from various camps, his last two attempts being at Gravenhurst. Today, all that remains of Camp 20 is concrete pillars, a fire hydrant, and the outline of a fence. There is an information kiosk at the end of Lorne Street where visitors can go to get more information on the camp. =Original townships= The Town of Gravenhurst includes these original townships from the 1800s: * Wood Township (eastern half) * Morrison Township * Ryde Township * Muskoka Township Demographics In the 2011 Census, Statistics Canada originally reported that the Town of Gravenhurst had a population of 11,640 living in 4,674 of its 7,757 total dwellings, a 5.4% change from its 2006 population of 11,046. Statistics Canada subsequently amended the 2011 census results to a population of 12,055 living in 4,845 of its 8,202 total dwellings, a 9.1% change from 2006. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. In 2006, Gravenhurst's population was 95.6% white, 2.0% Aboriginal and 2.4% visible minorities. In the summer months, Gravenhurst has a population of approximately 34,000 due to cottagers coming up to stay for the summer. Age Structure *0‚Äì14 years: 14.6% *15‚Äì64 years: 64.3% *65 years and over: 21.1% Transportation Gravenhurst also declares itself the \\"Gateway to the Muskoka Lakes\\" and has a large gate bearing this message hanging over Muskoka District Road 169, the main road leading into town from Highway 11. The gate had been removed but was rebuilt in 2009 and stands again at the south end of town. It is the home port of the RMS Segwun, the oldest vessel powered by a working steam engine in North America. Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services provides inter-city bus service to Gravenhurst along its Toronto to North Bay routes. The nearby Muskoka Airport has scheduled flights to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and also serves general aviation. The former Gravenhurst railway station was served by Ontario Northland Railway's Northlander passenger train until the train was discontinued in 2012, it is now a railway museum. Attractions Parts of the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park and Torrance Barrens Conservation Reserve are in Gravenhurst. =The Muskoka Wharf= View of Muskoka Wharf from over the bay The Muskoka Wharf, located on Lake Muskoka, was completed in 2005. The project cost $170 million and spreads across 89 acres. Before the new development was built, the wharf used to be used for lumber and boat building industries. It was also the entry point to the lakes. Years ago, a train would arrive at the wharf three times a day with passengers coming to Muskoka looking to settle. Today, the wharf is full of retailers and restaurants like Boston Pizza and the Blue Willow Tea Shop. The wharf hosts a number of events in the summer including Pirate Fest and the Gravenhurst farmers‚Äô market. There are also condominiums and a Marriott hotel for those looking to spend some time in Gravenhurst. =Winter Carnival= Every year Gravenhurst has a winter carnival for the community to enjoy. There are events for every age at the carnival including donut eating contests, sno-yoga, ball hockey, a polar dip, and arm wrestling. The town has several dances for anyone ages nineteen and older as well as fireworks on Sunday for the closing ceremony. The fireworks take place at the Muskoka Wharf. Education Located on the shore of Lake Muskoka since 1949 Gravenhurst has been home to the Ontario Fire College. The College run by the Province of Ontario, under the Fire Marshall's Office, offers training and education programs which are based on the Ontario Fire Service Standards. Courses are available to members of any Ontario municipal fire department, whether full-time or volunteer. The campus also provides a location for Ontario Provincial Police marine and K-9 training. Public education consists of Gravenhurst High School, and three elementary schools administered by the Trillium Lakelands District School Board.

R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. \\"Turambar and the Foal√≥k√´\\", begun in 1917, is the first appearance of T√∫rin in the legendarium. J.R.R. Tolkien consciously based the story on the medieval tale of Kullervo in the Finnish mythological poem Kalevala compiled by Elias L√∂nnrot, saying that it was \\"an attempt to reorganize...the tale of Kullervo the hapless, into a form of my own\\".Letters, p. 214 Also called \\"The Tale of Grief\\", \\"Narn i Ch√Æn H√∫rin\\", commonly called \\"The Narn\\", it tells of the tragic fates of the children of H√∫rin, namely his son T√∫rin (Turambar) and his daughter Nienor. Excerpts of the story were published before, in The Silmarillion (prose), Unfinished Tales (prose), The Book of Lost Tales Part II (prose), The Lays of Beleriand (verse in alliterative long-lines) and most recently in 1994 in The War of the Jewels (prose), the latter three part of The History of Middle-earth series. T√∫rin Turambar is the primary protagonist and tragic hero of the novel The Children of H√∫rin, published after Tolkien's death by his son Christopher Tolkien and drawing from many of the above sources to finally present a complete narrative. His title, \\"Turambar\\", means master of fate. Later, on his tombstone, it was written, \\"...Master of Fate, yet by fate mastered,\\" concluding his tragedy, and ultimately showing his failure to achieve his goals of escaping the curse ill fate Morgoth had cast upon him. In the books, T√∫rin was a Man of the First Age of Middle-earth, whose family had been cursed by the ultimate evil being of the legendarium, Morgoth. In course of his unsuccessful attempts to defy the curse, T√∫rin brought ruin upon several Mannish and Elven strongholds as well as upon himself and his sister Ni√´nor N√≠niel. Their history was recorded in the Tale of the Children of H√∫rin or Narn i Ch√Æn H√∫rin, which was claimed by Tolkien to be the ultimate source of the published writings.Morgoth's Ring, \\"Myths Transformed\\" (I), p. 373 and note 2 T√∫rin is briefly mentioned in The Fellowship of the Ring, but little more is said than that he was one of \\"the mighty Elf-friends of old\\". In The Two Towers, his name is briefly mentioned as a strong warrior. Appearances T√∫rin was the son of H√∫rin Thalion, Lord of the Folk of Hador, and Morwen Eledhwen of the House of B√´or. He was born in the month of Gwaeron (March) of the Year of the Sun 464.Narn: \\"The Childhood of T√∫rin\\" He had a younger sister, Lalaith, but she died of a plague at the age of three, when a pestilent wind came from Angband. T√∫rin was also taken sick at that time, but recovered. His closest childhood friend was Sador One-foot. The Siege of Angband was already broken at that time, but T√∫rin's homeland of Dor-l√≥min was still contested by the Folk of Hador against Morgoth's forces. When T√∫rin was eight years old, H√∫rin led most of his Men to war, and all were slain during the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. H√∫rin himself was captured alive, and cursed by Morgoth together with his family. Dor-l√≥min was invaded by the Easterlings at Morgoth's command. T√∫rin remained with Morwen, who hid him from the Incomers, fearing that they would enslave or kill him as the heir of both Dor- l√≥min and Ladros. She sent him secretly and under protection of Grithnir and Gethron to the Elven-realm of Doriath; Morwen remained in Dor-l√≥min herself, and shortly afterwards T√∫rin's second sister, Ni√´nor, was born. T√∫rin and his guides eventually reached Doriath, and were enmeshed in the Girdle of Melian. There they came near to death, but the marchwarden Beleg Strongbow found them and led them to the halls of Menegroth. King Thingol adopted T√∫rin, in memory of H√∫rin's heroism and because of his kinship with Beren. One of T√∫rin's friends there was an elven-lady Nellas, who watched over him at Queen Melian's bidding and taught elven-lore. T√∫rin became esteemed and renowned for his prowess and bravery, and Beleg became his teacher of warfare. When after eight yearsT√∫rin reached Doriath in 473, and Dor-l√≥min was cut off in 481. Statements in The Silmarillion (Ch. 21) and The Children of H√∫rin (Ch. 5) that T√∫rin had dwelt in Doriath for nine years by this time derive from an early version of Quenta Silmarillion (The Lost Road, pp. 320‚Äì2), and are contradicted by both earlier and later texts (e.g. The Grey Annals, pp. 79‚Äì80), as well as by the statement in The Children of H√∫rin (ibid.) that he was 17 then. Dor-l√≥min was cut off and tidings from Morwen and Ni√´nor ceased, T√∫rin decided to pit his strength against Morgoth's forces, hoping to avenge thus the sorrows of his kin. Thingol appointed him to be one of his \\"knights of the sword\\",Narn: \\"T√∫rin in Doriath\\" and T√∫rin departed to the northern marches of Doriath to fight the Orcs, where he was joined by Beleg. His chief weapon for ever after became the sword, and in addition he wore now the Dragon-helm of Hador, so that the Orcs began to fear him. At the age of 20,The War of the Jewels: The Grey Annals, pp. 61‚Äì103, 129‚Äì165. T√∫rin accidentally killed Saeros, one of Thingol's counsellors, who had scorned him for his attire and mortal lineage. T√∫rin injured him for this, but later was ambushed by Saeros. T√∫rin overpowered him, chasing him at sword point to a ravine where, in an attempt to jump, Saeros stumbled and died on the rocks below. Heedless of Mablung's counsels, and before T√∫rin could have been either punished or absolved, he fled from Doriath, fearing imprisonment. Thingol, after learning of the circumstances from Nellas, eventually pardoned T√∫rin, and Beleg obtained leave to seek out his friend. T√∫rin was unaware of this and fled westward, eventually meeting up with a band of outlaws called Gaurwaith that dwelt in the woods south of the river Taeglin. He proved his worth for them by killing one of their best warriors, and thus earned himself a place in the band. At that moment he wished neither to depart anywhere else, nor to strive with them, and so he did little to restrain other members from their evil deeds, such as harassing scattered homesteads of Men. A year later, in an attempt to save the daughter of Larnach, a woodman, T√∫rin accidentally killed Forweg, the leader of the band. He then claimed his place, and this was granted to him as \\"the best man\\" among the outlaws.Narn: \\"T√∫rin among the Outlaws\\". Soon Beleg found the band in the wild, while T√∫rin was absent spying upon the Orcs. The outlaws treated the Elf badly, and this, as well as the counsels of Beleg, made T√∫rin stop the lawless way of the band's life, hunting hereafter only the servants of Angband. He rejected Beleg's advice to return to Doriath, and the Elf then departed to Menegroth. Later T√∫rin's band captured M√Æm the Petty-dwarf; his two sons escaped, but one of them, Kh√Æm, was mortally wounded by an outlaw Andr√≥g. In order to save his own life, M√Æm was forced to share his dwellings upon the hill of Amon R√ªdh with the band. Beleg returned to T√∫rin after a time, healing those of the band that had become sick with cold and delivering them lembas of Melian. He also brought the Dragon- helm, and the area around Amon R√ªdh became known as Dor-C√∫arthol, the \\"Land of Bow and Helm\\". Many warriors joined them, and much of West Beleriand was freed from evil by the prowess of the \\"Two Captains\\", Beleg and T√∫rin. However, by wearing the Helm T√∫rin revealed his identity to Morgoth, who sent a host of Orcs against Amon R√ªdh two years later. These found M√Æm, and he once again bought his life by leading them up the hill. T√∫rin was captured and all his men slain, except Beleg and Andv√≠r.The War of the Jewels, \\"√Ülfwine and D√≠rhaval\\", pp. 311‚Äì315 Beleg followed the Orcs through the forest of Taur-nu- Fuin, where he met Gwindor, a slave who escaped from Angband. Together they rescued T√∫rin upon the confines of Anfauglith. Unfortunately, when Beleg was cutting the sleeping T√∫rin free from his bonds, he pricked T√∫rin's foot with the sword Anglachel, and T√∫rin, mistaking Beleg in the darkness for an orc come to torment him, took the sword and slew Beleg. T√∫rin became dazed with grief after this, but Gwindor led him to the Pools of Ivrin, where he returned to senses. They journeyed to the hidden fortress of Nargothrond, where Gwindor had formerly been a lord. He gave Beleg's black sword Anglachel to T√∫rin now, who had it reforged and renamed as Gurthang, \\"Iron of Death\\". T√∫rin hid his own name, eventually becoming known as Mormegil or the Blacksword of Nargothrond, because of his prowess with Gurthang. Gwindor met there again his beloved, Finduilas daughter of King Orodreth, but she unwillingly fell in love with T√∫rin; however, T√∫rin did not perceive this and held her in awe. T√∫rin was extremely influential in Nargothrond, becoming a chief counsellor of Orodreth and eventually overruling both him and Gwindor. He encouraged the Elves to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the Doors of Nargothrond and managed to clear the land between River Sirion and Falas from enemies. However, T√∫rin became arrogant, ignoring even a warning from the Vala Ulmo, brought by Gelmir and Arminas, to destroy the bridge and return to secrecy. When T√∫rin had dwelt in Nargothrond for five years, Morgoth sent a great host of Orcs led by the dragon Glaurung against Nargothrond, and T√∫rin encouraged Orodreth to send his forces to fight them in the open. During the ensuing Battle of Tumhalad, Nargothrond's forces were destroyed and Orodreth was slain, while the bridge helped Morgoth's forces to locate the fortress and cross the river Narog. T√∫rin fought valiantly and was alone able to withstand Glaurung, but he forsook the battle to carry away the mortally wounded Gwindor. Before he died, he instructed T√∫rin to save Finduilas, prophesying that she alone can save T√∫rin from his doom. Hastening to save the captives of Nargothrond, T√∫rin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung, and stood by enspelled and immobile as Finduilas was dragged away, calling to him. The dragon deceived him into believing that Morwen and Ni√´nor were suffering in Dor-l√≥min, and T√∫rin abandoned Finduilas to seek out his kin. Next year he reached Dor-l√≥min,The War of the Jewels: \\"The Wanderings of H√∫rin\\", pp. 256‚Äì257 (a plot-synopsis for the Narn) but found his old house empty and went to the halls of Brodda the Easterling, who had taken H√∫rin's lands and possessions. There T√∫rin learned from Brodda's wife Aerin that Morwen had already left for Doriath before the fall of Nargothrond, as T√∫rin's own efforts had made the way passable. In his rage he killed Brodda and his followers, rising a revolt. As he left, Aerin burnt herself alive in her halls, and the remnant of the Folk of Hador was persecuted even more cruelly from that time. T√∫rin next tried to find Finduilas and followed the trail towards the forest of Brethil, but came too late: the woodmen informed him that she had been killed by the orcs when the Men of Brethil had ambushed them in an attempt to rescue the prisoners. T√∫rin collapsed of grief upon her grave, and was brought to Ephel Brandir. There he took up his life again, now calling himself Turambar (\\"Master of Doom\\") and renouncing his descent, hoping to overcome thus his curse. The Folk of Haleth dwelling there was ruled by Brandir the Lame, who hoped to preserve his people by secrecy. Turambar quickly gained the favour of the Folk and once again overruled Brandir, gathering companies to fight Orcs upon the borders. He stopped wielding Gurthang and fought rather with a spear and a bow. Meanwhile, Morwen and Ni√´nor dwelt in Doriath, but when the news of Nargothrond's destruction had reached them, they rashly went to look for T√∫rin, aided by a small company of Elves. Glaurung, who now lived in the ruined halls of Nargothrond, descended into the river so that a fog rose and enmeshed the company. Morwen was lost, but Ni√´nor met the dragon and was enspelled by him, forgetting her past. Eventually she fled from both the Elves and the Orcs that pursued her and reached Brethil. Turambar found her at Finduilas's grave, naked, unable to speak and remembering nothing. He named her N√≠niel, \\"Maid of Tears\\", and took her to Ephel Brandir. There she was healed by Brandir, who fell in love with her; however, N√≠niel and Turambar came to love each other. T√∫rin asked her in marriage, but Brandir managed to dissuade her, foreboding evil; yet when Turambar had vowed to forsake war for her sake unless to protect her, N√≠niel finally married him. Turambar was forced to go back to war when Glaurung sent Orcs to attack Brethil: taking the sword up again, T√∫rin drove them away, taking control of the Folk from Brandir. Next year N√≠niel conceived; however, soon Glaurung attacked Brethil himself. Turambar decided to ambush the Dragon as he crossed the ravine of Cabed-en-Aras and to try stabbing him from beneath. He took two companions with him, Dorlas and Hunthor, but the first deserted them and the other was slain by a stone. Turambar mortally wounded Glaurung with Gurthang, but was hurt by the venom of the Dragon's blood and fell in a swoon. When N√≠niel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last words undid his spell, and she remembered who she was and realized that Turambar was her brother. Horrified, Ni√´nor cast herself over the brink of the ravine into the river Taeglin and died. Brandir witnessed this, and when Turambar awoke, he told him what had happened and taunted him from his jealousy that T√∫rin had more respect than he and had had the love of N√≠niel. Refusing to believe and in wrath on his fate, T√∫rin slew the defenceless Brandir and ran in madness towards Finduilas's grave. There he was met by Mablung of Doriath, who confirmed the words of Brandir were true. In despair and shame T√∫rin fled back to Cabed-en-Aras and cast himself upon the point of his sword Gurthang. T√∫rin was buried in a high mound near the brink of Cabed- en-Aras, together with Gurthang which had broken asunder. A great stone was set upon the grave, upon which the Elves wrote in Cirth, the runes of Doriath: T√öRIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA NIENOR N√çNIEL (T√∫rin, Conqueror of Fate, Slayer of Glaurung Ni√´nor N√≠niel) However, Ni√´nor's body was not there and could not have been found. Two years later Morwen and H√∫rin met at that place for the last time, and Morwen was also buried there. The mound survived the War of Wrath and the Drowning of Beleriand, and as Tol Morwen was one of the islands off the coast of Middle- earth in later ages. =Fate after death= Tolkien also wrote several versions of a prophecy about T√∫rin's fate after his death. In the earliest outline preserved, where the tale is drafted only cursorily and has many elements missing, a reference already appears to \\"purification of Turambar and Vain√≥ni (the original name of Ni√´nor) who fare shining about the world and go with the hosts of Tulkas against Melkor (Morgoth)].\\" In the finished manuscript of The Tale of Turambar and the Foal√≥k√´, this is elaborated into a story that T√∫rin and Nienor were not at first admitted to Mandos because of their deeds; but after their parents' prayers, they were permitted to enter the \\"bath of flame\\", where the Sun replenished its light, \\"and so were all their sorrows and stains washed away, and they dwelt as shining Valar among the blessed ones‚Äù.\\" A new detail is introduced, that \\"Turambar indeed shall stand beside Fionw√´ [E√∂nw√´] in the Great Wrack, and Melko [Morgoth] and his drakes [name of the dragons in Tolkien legendarium] shall curse the sword of Mormakil [name of the sword of T√∫rin]\\". In later Tolkien's writings no reference to Ni√´nor's fate appears, but T√∫rin's destiny is made even more prominent. The notion maintained for a long time was that T√∫rin would take part in the Last Battle fought before the End of the World, when Morgoth would return and make the final assault upon the Valar and the Children of Il√∫vatar. In an early text, known as \\"Earliest Silmarillion\\", it is \\"the spirit of T√∫rin\\" who came back and fought, and \\"it shall be T√∫rin who with his black sword will slay Morgoth\\" while in the revision of the Quenta Noldorinwa carried out in 1930 the battle is described thus: In the same text says that after the victory over Morgoth the prophecy of Mandos about man not saying anything but \\"save of T√∫rin only, and him it names among the Gods.\\" In \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\", published in 1937, T√∫rin also takes part in the Last Battle, he \\"will come from the halls of Mandos\\" and his sword causes Morgoth \\"death and final end\\",The Lost Road\\", The conclusion of the Quenta Silmarillion\\", p. 333 but in this text T√∫rin gets a place among \\"the sons of the Valar\\", although the whole line about the prophecy of the Mandos about the man, including the presence of T√∫rin among the sons of the Valar, in \\"Later Quenta Silmarillion\\" was marked with a large cross, that in the works of Tolkien mean that there is \\"some misstatement in the text that requires revision\\"The Shaping of Middle- earth, The Quenta, p. 135The War of the Jewels, \\"The Later Quenta Silmarillion\\", p. 247 Also, in \\"Later Quenta Silmarillion\\" the string of \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" about the arrival of T√∫rin from the halls of Mandos was corrected to \\"returning from the Doom of Men at the ending of the world\\", but the strings with participation of T√∫rin in the battle against Morgoth and the death of Morgoth from the black sword of T√∫rin were neither removed nor marked in any way, corrected or replaced. Among the texts of Tolkien, written for the \\"Narn i Ch√Æn H√∫rin\\", which dates from the 1950s, contains the prophecy of Finduilas stating that \\"The Adanedhel [one of the names of T√∫rin] is mighty in the tale of the World, and his stature shall reach yet to Morgoth in some far day to come.\\"Unfinished Tales, Appendix to Narn i H√Æn H√∫rin In 1958, Tolkien wrote that when Varda set the constellation of Menelmacar, she intended it to be \\"a sign of T√∫rin Turambar\\" and \\"a foreshowing of the Last Battle.\\"Morgoth's Ring, \\"The Annals of Aman\\", p. 71 In one of the footnotes to his later texts ¬´Problem of Ros¬ª, Tolkien mentions prophecy of Andreth, according to which T√∫rin \\"in the Last Battle should return from the Dead, and before he left the Circles of the World for ever should challenge the Great Dragon of Morgoth, Ancalagon the Black, and deal him the death-stroke.\\".The Peoples of Middle- earth, \\"The Problem of Ros\\", p. 374 note 17 According to Christopher Tolkien, the term \\"Last Battle\\" is used in the same text the ¬´Problem of Ros¬ª, as a designation for the War of Wrath and in this last reappearance of the idea of the return of T√∫rin, Andreth predicted the War of Wrath, in which according to the all more earliest texts, the death of Ancalagon the Black was attributed to E√§rendil. Characteristics T√∫rin is said to have been one of the fairest Men to have ever lived: \\"dark-haired and pale-skinned, ... his face more beautiful than any other among mortal Men, in the Elder Days.\\"The Silmarillion, Ch. 21 \\"Of T√∫rin Turambar\\", p. 207‚Äì210 In this he is stated to have taken after his mother Morwen,The Silmarillion, Ch. 18 \\"Of the Coming of Men into the West\\", p. 148 descended from the House of B√´or, in contrast to his fair-haired father H√∫rin from the House of Hador. According to Gwindor's words, T√∫rin was very tall, \\"as tall as are the Men from the misty hills of Hithlum,\\" in which he supposedly took after his grandfather Galdor the Tall since both H√∫rin and the Folk of B√´or were shorter than was usual among the Men of Hador. Tolkien was not consistent in describing T√∫rin's eyes. According to some texts \\"he had the beauty of his mother and the eyes of his father\\",Narn: \\"The Departure of T√∫rin\\". which were blue,Narn, \\"The Death of T√∫rin\\": \\"[Ni√´nor's] eyes were blue, her hair fine gold, the very likeness in woman's form of H√∫rin her father.\\" Cf. The Silmarillion, ch. 18, p. 148 while in other T√∫rin is said to have inherited the grey eyes of his mother. It is also stated that his eyes were bright, and that \\"few indeed could challenge the eyes of T√∫rin in set will or in wrath.\\"Narn: \\"Of M√Æm the Dwarf\\" Thus it is possible that he inherited the \\"elven-light ... hard to endure\\" of his mother's eyes.The War of the Jewels: The Wanderings of H√∫rin, p. 273 As a child of five years, T√∫rin is described thus: A similar reference to this last trait of T√∫rin's character is found in Finduilas' words: \\"He is not yet awake, but still pity can ever pierce his heart, and he will never deny it. Pity maybe shall be ever the only entry.\\" His reserved nature is also said to have resulted from Morgoth's curse; thus during T√∫rin's sojourn in Doriath \\"...it seemed that fortune was unfriendly to him, so that often what he designed went awry, and what he desired he did not gain; neither did he win friendship easily, for he was not merry, and laughed seldom.\\" T√∫rin is said to have been greatly affected by the deaths of his friends; thus after overcoming pestilence himself and the death of Lalaith, T√∫rin's character was hardened and he became even more reserved. Tolkien also stated that T√∫rin ever after \\"sought in all faces of women the face of Lalaith,\\"Unfinished Tales, notes 6 and 8 to Narn i H√Æn H√∫rin that he did not love Finduilas because \\"his mind and heart were elsewhere, by rivers in springs long past,\\" and that T√∫rin did fall in love with N√≠niel because she reminded him of Lalaith. The grief that he had slain Beleg \\"was graven on the face of T√∫rin and never faded\\"; early Tolkien's writings add that after this time \\"wild and black was his hair yet streaked with grey, and his face was pale and marked as with deep sorrows of the past.\\"Book of Lost Tales 2, \\"Turambar and the Foal√≥k√´\\", pp. 69‚Äì143 Tolkien gave another T√∫rin's trait which differed him from others: \\"his speech and bearing were that of the ancient kingdom of Doriath\\", implying that he used a more archaic and 'noble' variant of the Sindarin language. T√∫rin was a cousin of Tuor Eladar, father of E√§rendil the Blessed. There are many parallels between the circumstances of their lives (both lost their fathers in the N√≠rnaeth Arnoediad, were raised in part by Elves, spent time as outlaws, were war-leaders in great Elvish fortresses and survived their downfall), but the outcome of Tuor's life was quite different. Even T√∫rin's colouring was dark, enhancing his resemblance to the Noldorin Elves but further setting him apart from his fair-haired cousin. The two never actually met, but Tuor did once see his cousin in passing at Eithel Ivrin. The cousins' respective fates ‚Äì suicide and paradise ‚Äì are analogous to those in Greek myth of Ajax and Achilles. T√∫rin is one of the few characters in Tolkien's writings to have committed suicide, and several of the others ‚Äì Aerin, Ni√´nor, and H√∫rin ‚Äì are connected to his story. =Names and titles= The name T√∫rin supposedly comes from the speech of the Folk of Hador, with unknown etymology. Turambar derives from Quenya, an Elvish language created by Tolkien, with the meaning \\"Master of Fate\\" (Q. Tur- 'mastery', umbar or ambar 'fate').The Lost Road: \\"The Etymologies\\", pp. 339‚Äì400. Stems TUR-, MBARAT-, MOR-, MAK-, NDAK-. All other names given to and taken by T√∫rin come from Sindarin, another Elven-tongue devised by Tolkien. The Sindarin form of Turambar, rarely used by Tolkien, was Turumarth (S. umarth or amarth 'fate', also √∫marth 'ill-fate'). After leaving Doriath, T√∫rin usually tried to conceal his curse and, consequently, his true name. When he first appeared among the outlaws, he called himself Neithan, \\"the Wronged\\", as he thought that he had been expelled from Doriath. Later he took the name Gorthol, \\"the Dread Helm\\" (S. gor- 'horror', th√¥l 'helm'),The Silmarillion, Appendix, pp. 355‚Äì365 since he wore the Dragon-helm then. When T√∫rin came to Nargothrond, he hid his identity under the epithet Agarwaen son of √ömarth, \\"the Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate\\", but soon became generally known as Adanedhel, \\"Man-Elf\\", since he greatly resembled Elves in manners and looks. Finduilas also called him Thurin, \\"the Secret\\", and after the reforging of the black sword Gurthang and because of his prowess with it, T√∫rin was known as Mormegil, \\"the Blacksword\\" (S. mor- \\"black\\", magol or megil \\"sword\\"). When he first met the Men of Brethil, T√∫rin presented himself as the Wildman of the Woods, but soon took the name Turambar when he decided to settle there. He was also entitled Dagnir Glaurunga, \\"the Bane of Glaurung\\" (S. dagnir 'slayer'). =Line of T√∫rin and Nienor= Concept and creation =Inspiration= Resemblance of T√∫rin to figures from medieval tales can be confirmed by a letter which Tolkien wrote to Milton Waldman, a publisher from the HarperCollins, concerning the fate of his works: Tolkien based T√∫rin on the tragic figure of Kullervo from the Finnish Kalevala. Painting Kullervo Rides to War by Akseli Gallen-Kallela, 1901 T√∫rin is mainly based on Kullervo, a character from the Finnish folklore poems known as Kalevala, who was also \\"cursed\\" in a sense, seduced his sister, brought ruin upon his family and slew himself. There is a degree of connection to Norse mythology: T√∫rin resembles Sigurd in the Volsunga saga, as both achieve great renown for the slaying of a dragon of immense power, in Sigurd's case Fafnir, in T√∫rin's Glaurung. There is also, according to Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger, a link to Arthurian Legend, with its complex temporal layering, history of manuscripts, and \\"overlapping story variants in both poetry and prose\\", supplemented by Tolkien's pretence that he was translating a lost Narn poem from the Elvish. Tolkien mentions also the resemblance to the unfortunate Oedipus, prince of Thebes, who unwittingly fulfils a prophecy that he will kill his father and marry his mother. Richard West, in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, writes indeed that the tale \\"is one of almost unrelieved gloom\\", though he notes that a prophecy in Tolkien's mythology holds that T√∫rin and his sister will help in the final defeat of Morgoth after the end of the world. West observes also that as in many other stories of Middle-earth, there is a \\"delicate balance\\" between fate, whereby the character inevitably takes certain actions and suffers the consequences, and free will, whereby he makes his own bold or rash choices that determine the outcomes for him. =Other versions of the story= =Rejected names= The idea of T√∫rin changing his name to escape his doom is present already in the original versions of the tale, although to a lesser extent. The name Turambar goes to preliminary drafts, where however it was taken by T√∫rin at his first encounter with Glaurung after the latter had \\"revealed\\" to T√∫rin that he was cursed. Blacksword also appears there, as a side-name; in addition T√∫rin is said to have called himself \\"Turambar son of the weary forest\\" when he returned to Dor-l√≥min, with Quenya form R√∫sitaurion and Gnomish bo-Dhrauthodavros. Tolkien was hesitant about the exact Elvish transcriptions of names: in various texts the later Turumarth appears as Turumart, Turmarth, or Turamarth; Mormegil as Mormagli(r) or Mormael in Gnomish/Sindarin and as Mormakil in Quenya.The Shaping of Middle-earth, \\"The Earliest 'Silmarillion'\\", p. 29‚Äì30, 40‚Äì41; \\"The Quenta\\", p. 125‚Äì131The Lost Road, pp. 139‚Äì140, 315, 321. The original form of Agarwaen \\"Bloodstained\\" was Iarwaeth, and Thurin \\"the Secret\\" supposedly originated in Thuringud \\"the Hidden Foe\\". In early texts Tolkien usually interpreted Turambar as \\"the Conqueror of Fate\\". Portrayal Several artists have created illustrations of T√∫rin's story.

Ethnically, it includes Arabic music, Assyrian, Kurdish and the music of Turkmen, among others. Apart from the traditional music of these peoples, Iraqi music includes contemporary music styles such as pop, rock, soul and urban contemporary. Iraq is recognized mainly for three instruments, the Oud, Iraqi Santur and Joza. The most renowned Oudists are Ahmed Mukhtar, Naseer Shamma, Rahim AlHaj, Sahar Taha and Munir Bashir. Classical Iraqi Music Musical theater group in Baghdad, 1920s. Iraqi classical music necessitates some discussion of the social environment, as well as references to the poetry. Poetry is always rendered clearly. Poetry is the art of the Iraqis, and sung poetry is the finest of all. In Baghdad from 760-1260, writers spurned musical notation.Classical Music in Iraq Virginia Danielson, Harvard University The music is melodically modal, and moves in a stepwise motion with repeated notes. Use of the lower end of a melodic range is characteristic, as is the use of silence; one listens through the silence. Following a cadence, the singer moves up to the next range of pitches. An arch shape is discernible, and the work ends in the original mode. Singers of the Baghdad Court were praised for their excellence in composition, their knowledge of history and songs, and their ornaments and innovations. There was support for female singers and orators, such as Arib, a skilled poet, calligrapher, lutenist, composer, and backgammon player who wrote more than one thousand songs. The common instrument (comparable in popularity to the piano or violin in the west) is the oud. Classical Iraqi music is identifiable by the genre/canon, and by how it is performed. Historically, music would have been played for gatherings of men. With the advent of the sound recording industry, things have changed somewhat. Today one invites musicians to perform at weddings; by the first quarter of the century, concerts were being staged at concert venues. =Maqam= Traditional flute player from Iraqi folk troupe Across the Arab world, maqam refers to specific melodic modes. When a musician performs maqam performances, the performer improvises, based on rules. There are a number of different maqams, each with its own mood and characteristics. There are between fifty and seventy maqams, many of which have sub-styles. Other characteristics of Iraqi music include a slow tempo, rhythmically free ornamentation or melodic lines, and predominantly minor modes. Instruments include qanun, riq, santur, darbuka, naqareh, ney, djose and oud. Baghdad's Chalgi ensembles typically include the djoze and ney, and may also utilize an oud. \\"Lil 'Ashiqi fi-l Hawa Dala'il\\" by Ahmed Abdul Qadir al-Musili (1877-1941). Maqama texts are often derived from classical Arabic poetry, such as by Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri, al-Mutanabbi and Abu Nuwas, or Persian poets like Hafez and Omar Khayy√°m. Some performers used traditional sources translated into the dialect of Baghdad, and still others use Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, Hebrew, Turkmen, Aramaic or Persian language lyrics. History The roots of modern Iraqi maqam can be traced as far back as the Abbassid Caliphate, when that large empire was controlled from Baghdad. The pesteh, a kind of light song which concludes a maqam performance, has been popularized in the later 20th century, growing more prominent along with the rise of recorded music and broadcast radio. Among the most popular pesteh performers are the husband and wife Salima Pasha and Nazem Al-Ghazali. The most popular modern singers of maqam are Rachid Al-Qundarchi (1887‚Äì1945), Youssouf Omar (1918‚Äì1987), Nazem Al-Ghazali (1920‚Äì1963), Salim Shibbeth (born 1908), Hassan Chewke (1912‚Äì1962), Najim Al-Sheikhli (1893‚Äì1938), Mohammed Al-Qubanchi (1900‚Äì1989), Hamid Al Saadi (1959-) and Farida Mohammad Ali (1963- ). Modern era Munir Bashir, an acclaimed oud singer. Omar Bashir, a modern day oud singer. For much of the 20th century, Egypt was the center for Arab popular music, with only a few stars from other countries finding international success. Singers were Muslims, Jews and Christians. Iraqi instrumentalists attended the famous 1932 Arabic music congress in Cairo, which the Muslim vocalist Muhammed al-Qubanchi also attended. In 1936, Iraq Radio was established by two of Iraq's most prominent performers and composers, Saleh and Daoud al-Kuwaity with an ensemble, with the exception of the percussion player. The nightclubs of Baghdad also featured almost entirely Jewish musicians. At these nightclubs, ensembles consisted of oud, qanun and two percussionists while the same format with ney and cello were used on the radio. One of the reasons for the predominance of Jewish instrumentalists in early 20th century Iraqi music was a prominent school for blind Jewish children, which was founded in the late 1920s by the great qanunji (\\"qanun player\\") Joseph Hawthorne (Yusef Za'arur) ( ). Many of the students became musicians, eventually forming the Arabic music ensemble \\"Israel Radio\\" ( Qol Yisraeli ). The most famous singer of the 1930s-1940s was perhaps Salima Pasha. . During the 1920s, two brothers began to gain prominence in the field of music in Iraq; the Kuwaiti brothers - Salih, a violin player, and Dawud, an oud player. Almost at the same time, the name of a woman singer, Salima Pasha began to achieve fame. The brothers, Salih and Dawud el-Kuwaiti began to perform and to compose new songs for Pasha. Salih became the most prominent musician in Iraq, and Pasha became the most famous singer. Following the opening of the Iraqi Broadcast Station in 1936. Salih was asked to form the official music ensemble for the radio station. It was due to him, that two instruments, the cello and nay (flute), were introduced for the first time into the instrumental music ensemble. The respect and adoration for Pasha were unusual at the time, since public performance by women was considered shameful and most female singers were recruited from brothels. Numerous instrumentalists and singers of the middle and late twentieth century were trained at the Baghdad Conservatory. In recent years the Iraqi school of oud players has become very prominent, with players such as Salman Shukur and Munir Bashir developing a very refined and delicate style of playing combining older Arabic elements with more recent Anatolian influences. Pop music Pop music in Iraq more often than not means musical motifs and lyrics dating back centuries but performed with a mix of traditional and modern instruments. Kadim Al Sahir, for example, may be nicknamed \\"the Elvis of the Middle East,\\" but he sings in classical Arabic. Popular musician Ilham al-Madfai features the electric guitar and saxophone, but uses the instruments to reinterpret age-old folk songs. Until the fall of Saddam Hussein, the most popular radio station was the Voice of Youth, which used to play the popular music of Iraq to continue the culture of the country. The station also played a mix of rock, hip hop and pop music from artists as far-ranging as Eminem to R.E.M., all of which had to be imported via Jordan due to international economic sanctions, and both disc jockeys and callers spoke exclusively in English. Irish bands The Corrs and Westlife were especially popular. Iraq also produced a major pan-Arab pop star in exile in Kadim Al Sahir, whose songs include Ladghat-e Hayya, which was banned by Hussein for its racy lyrical content. Other modern Iraqi singers include Ali Al Essawi, whose song Makhtuba became huge hit in the Arab world and made him famous throughout the region. Major artists include Shatha Hassoun, Rahma Mezher, Majid al-Muhandis, Hussam Al-Rassam, Rida Al Abdullah and Iraq's very own boy band Unknown to No One, as well as Acrassicauda, Iraq's first heavy metal band. There are also ethnic Assyrian singers such as Klodia Hanna, Ashur Bet Sargis and Linda George as well as a number of Kurdish, Turkmen, Yazidi, Dom and Armenian musicians such as Seta Hagopian. Effect of 2003 Iraq War Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq and fall of Saddam Hussein, some musicians have come under attack by militants. Basra's sea shanties are well known throughout Iraq. Music shops in the Summar district have been the target of grenade bombings. Religious leaders have closed some of the concert halls and clubs in the city.

Amherstburg (2016 population: 21,936, urban area: 13,910) is a town near the mouth of the Detroit River in Essex County, Ontario, Canada. In 1796, Fort Malden was established here, stimulating growth in the settlement. The fort has been designated as a National Historic Site. The town is approximately south of the U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan, facing Wyandotte, Grosse Ile Township, Brownstown Charter Township, Trenton, and Gibraltar, Michigan. It is part of the Windsor census metropolitan area. Communities Besides the town proper of Amherstburg, the town of Amherstburg comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Amherst Point, Bar Point, Busy Bee Corners, Edgewater Beach, Glen Eden, Lake Erie Country Club, Lakewood Beach, Malden Centre, McGregor (partially), River Canard (partially), Sunset Beach, Willow Beach, Willowood; Golfview, Kingsbridge, Pointe West; Auld, Gordon, Loiselleville, North Malden, Quarries, Southwick, Splitlog; Good Child Beach, The Meadows History French colonists had settled along what became the Canadian side of the Detroit River during the colonial era, establishing small farms. The Petite C√¥te settlement was founded along the river to the north. In 1796, after losing the Thirteen Colonies following the American Revolutionary War, the British established Fort Malden as a military fort overlooking the river's mouth at Lake Erie. It was occupied as a garrison. This stimulated development in the area, as did the Crown granting land in Upper Canada to Loyalists (now known as United Empire Loyalists) in compensation for losses in the Thirteen Colonies, or as payment for service in the military during the war. The Crown also wanted to increase population and development in Upper Canada. The new settlers built many of their houses in the French style of a century before, giving the new town a historic character. French-speaking colonists also settled here, some of whom were descendants of soldiers and traders associated with Fort Detroit, or other early colonists. They were known as Fort Detroit French, in contrast to later migrants of the 19th century from Quebec, who became known as Canadian French.Jack D. C√©cillon, Prayers, Petitions, and Protests: The Catholic Church and the Ontario Schools Crisis in the Windsor Border Region, 1910-1928, McGill-Queen's University Press, 2013, Chap 1: \\"Early Struggles for Bilingual Schools and the French Language in the Windsor Border Region\\", in pp. 16-41 St. Jean was their Catholic church. During the days of the Underground Railroad before the American Civil War, refugee African-American slaves often crossed the river to escape to freedom in Canada, after the Crown abolished slavery. Although Michigan was a free state, slavecatchers went to Detroit trying to capture slaves and take them to owners for bounty. Detroit abolitionists William Lambert and especially George DeBaptiste were key to helping the slaves escape. DeBaptiste owned a lake steamboat that he used to offload refugees in town while docked ostensibly to load lumber.Tobin, Jacqueline L. From Midnight to Dawn: The Last Tracks of the Underground Railroad. Anchor, 2008. p200-209 They used Fort Malden as one of several entry points to Canada. The town is mentioned in Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin as the entry point of George and Eliza, after escaping from slavery in the United States. By 1869, the town of Amherstburg in the Township of Malden County Essex had a population of 2,500. When the fort was no longer needed for military purposes, the government adapted it for use as a provincial \\"lunatic asylum\\". Its main building was later used as a Port of Entry Money Order office and Post Office savings bank.The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory. H. McEvoy, Editor and Compiler, Toronto : Robertson & Cook, Publishers, 1869 Amherstburg was incorporated as a town in 1878. The town is named after Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, commander of the British forces and first British Governor General of the Province of Quebec (1760). In 1998, The Town of Amherstburg absorbed the neighbouring Township of Anderdon (to its northeast) and Township of Malden (to its southeast) to form a larger Town of Amherstburg. At 20:01 Eastern Daylight Time on April 19, 2018, a magnitude 3.6 earthquake (with a depth of ) occurred in Amherstburg, between the main portion of town and McGregor. No damage was reported, but the 30-second shaking was felt in Windsor, Downtown Detroit, and the Downriver communities across the river, such as Grosse Ile, Michigan. Some minor shaking was felt as far away as Toledo, Ohio along Lake Erie and Ann Arbor in the interior of Michigan. Education The local public high school in Amherstburg is General Amherst High School, also named after Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst. Although General Amherst High School is located in the town, some youth residents choose to attend Sandwich Secondary School or St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic Secondary School, located near the neighbourhood of River Canard. French- speaking students in Amherstburg may also attend √âcole Secondaire E.J. Lajeunesse, located in Windsor, Ontario. Tourist attractions Amherstburg is home to several tourist attractions, including Fort Malden and the Amherstburg Freedom Museum (formerly the North American Black Historical Museum). This explores the history of African-American refugees in western Ontario, who sought freedom from slavery and made their homes here. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected in Amherstburg by the province to commemorate Bellevue House. Built c. 1816-19, it was the home of Catherine Reynolds, a landscape painter, and her brother Robert Reynolds. Additional tourist attractions include the Park House Museum and King's Navy Yard Park, both of which are located in the heart of old Amherstburg. The Gibson Gallery is located in a former Michigan Central Railroad Station (c. 1896), which has been fully restored. The gallery operates year-round, featuring exhibits by local artists, the permanent collection of the Art Gallery of Windsor, traveling exhibits from Ontario museums and galleries, and student art/photography exhibits. A restored Essex Terminal railway caboose is operated as a railway museum. Gordon House was built in 1798 as a residence overlooking the Detroit River. Since being restored, it houses a Marine exhibit.

Marathon Oil has a coke storage site near the river. =Chemical plant history= The production at the Honeywell plant of hydrofluoric acid (HF) was suspended in October 2013 in favour of a plant in Geismar, Louisiana. The Honeywell plant is used in the production of fuels, refrigerants, and other materials. HF is a precursor to numerous pharmaceuticals, as well as being used to produce Teflon, fluoropolymers and fluorocarbons. Because of its highly corrosive nature, HF is also used to dissolve glass, in glass etching and frosting, and is used in quartz purification, chemical milling, steel pickling and cleaning silicon wafers. It is produced by treating the mineral fluorite with sulfuric acid, which produces hydrogen fluoride and calcium sulfate. The plant, which is located at 395 Front Rd, North, had previously suspended its operations between 1992 and 1996. There is hope locally that production will resume at some future time. The plant's gypsum pond had been identified in 2008 as the source of high levels of arsenic pollution in the area, which have been a provincial Ministry of the Environment concern since 2006.\\"Amherstburg arsenic levels shrinking, residents told\\", Canada.com, 21 Feb 2008 Honeywell now owns the adjacent Brunner Mond chemical plant and soda ash settling basins site, whose former owners, General Chemical Industrial Products, declared bankruptcy in 2005.\\"Remediation of Amherstburg‚Äôs former General Chemical plant on schedule\\" 29 Apr 2013 This site was used since 1920 to manufacture calcium chloride and other chemicals, which were shipped from a deep water port on the Detroit River. The site has been since April 2012 the subject of remediation work, supervised by CH2M Hill.Daily Commercial News: \\"Amherstburg, Ontario chemical plant set to come down piece by piece,\\" 26 Apr 2012 The plant was once part of Allied Chemical, which retained it when it sold the soda ash and calcium chloride operations and Amherst Quarries to General Chemical. The plant is composed of three separate parcels connected through rights of way and easements. In 1999, Allied Signal merged with the much smaller Honeywell Inc. but chose to carry on the newly expanded corporation under the Honeywell name. Transportation Between Amherstburg and Windsor (the nearest local metropolis), there is no regularly scheduled bus line. Amherstburg Taxi and South Shore Taxi occasionally operate a \\"shared ride service\\" from Amherstburg to the Devonshire Mall in Windsor. Commercial rail service is provided through Essex Terminal Railway, which operates a 35 km line to Windsor. The former Michigan Central Railway/CASO railway linking Amherstburg to Essex was converted into the Cypher Systems Group Greenway rail trail in stages beginning in 2007, with the two stream bridges being rehabilitated for public use again in 2017. Small boats are welcome to call at any one of three local marinas that serve Lake Erie and the Detroit River. Amherstburg Ferry Company operates private ferry service to Bob-Lo Island community.

It has been celebrated annually on 12 June since 1992. It is the successor to October Revolution Day, the former national day in the Soviet Union. The day commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) on 12 June 1990. The passage of this Declaration by the First Congress of People's Deputies marked the beginning of constitutional reform in the Russian Soviet state. History With the creation of the post of the President of the Russian Federation and the adoption of the new Russian Constitution to reflect the new political reality, the national flag, anthem, and emblem of the Russian Federation were major landmarks in the consolidation of Russian statehood. The country's new name, the Russian Federation, was adopted on December 25, 1991. In 1992, the Supreme Soviet of Russia proclaimed June 12 as a national holiday. By presidential decree on June 2, 1994, the date was again proclaimed Russia's national holiday. Under a subsequent presidential decree on June 16, 1998, the holiday was officially named \\"Russia Day\\". In 2002, the new Labour Code gave its official seal to this title. Russia Day celebrations in Saint Petersburg, 2007. Russian attitudes towards this holiday are ambivalent.School of Russian and Asian Studies article According to the Fund \\"Public Opinion\\", June 12 is considered a holiday by 45% of Russians. It is noteworthy that the number of citizens who perceive this day as a holiday increased substantially over time. For example, in 2005 only 15% of Russians called it a holiday, and 29% did in 2014. At the same time, the number of people who receive the day off from work has declined: In 2005 the figure was 73%, in 2014 it was 60%, and by 2015 it had fallen to 42%. In 2019 the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic proclaimed Russia Day a \\"state holiday\\".. For the 2020 celebrations in the city of Kirov, from June 1, 2020 a flash mob #WeRussia () was launched, in which people can also take part. It is necessary to sing the anthem of the Russian Federation, having recorded this performance on video, and put it on social networks. From the first day of summer, you can participate in the Challenge #RussianRhymes: read video poems of Russian classics and publish on social networks. From June 5 to 12 the action ‚ÄúWindows of Russia‚Äù was taking place: decoration of windows, balconies and facades of residential buildings with symbols of our country. From June 8 to June 12, Kirov residents could join the ‚ÄúWelcome to Russia‚Äù and ‚ÄúRussia in the lens‚Äù promotions on the official pages of clubs in the community and centers of local activity. Challenges were held on the same dates: # Russian word - reading poems and excerpts from works of domestic writers and \\"I love you, Russia, I love you, Kirov\\", reading poems dedicated to the country and the city.

Prominent Russian writers, scientists and humanitarian workers receive State Awards from the President of Russia on this day. Most public offices and schools are closed on June 12. If the day falls on a weekend, the public holiday shifts to the following Monday. However, many Russians see Russia Day only as a day off. As it commemorates the Soviet Union's dissolution, it brings back bitter memories for some. This is because the dissolution led to severe unemployment, high crime and poverty within Russia and other former Soviet republics. In 2002, about 5000 representatives from across the country took part in the pageantry from Tverskaya Zastava to Manezh Square. The highlight of the Day of Russia-2003 was the air show, which included aerobatic teams \\"Russian Knights\\" and \\"Swifts\\". Sukhoi and MiG planes left a trail forming the Russian flag. On June 12, 2004 at Red Square a historical military parade was held. Its members, soldiers of the Russian army and representatives of 89 regions, dressed in national costumes, presented the audience the most significant milestones of Russian history. In 2007 celebrations occurred in a hundreds of cities. For example, in Krasnoyarsk action thousands of people in white, blue and red robes formed more than a kilometer long tricolor. Russia Day in 2008 was celebrated for three days from 11 to 14 June. In Tomsk a \\"Wooden Carnival\\" displayed a huge wooden Russian ruble, one hundred times the size of the coin. In Samara enthusiasts reconstructed forces of Minin and Pozharsky in 1612 with Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War. In Moscow, the holiday included a three-hour concert and concluded a six-month contest over the \\"Seven Wonders of Russia\\". In Red Square 20 lines of stage pyrotechnics, confetti cannon in the colors of the Russian flag and 100 guns. In 2009 residents of Volgograd formed a map of the country covering 127 square meters. In Sevastopol, youths passed through the city center carrying a 30-meter flag of Russia. In Moscow, at Revolution Square that day a two-meter Khokhloma doll was painted. For the first time at the Ostankino Tower the state flag was displayed. Name According to some surveys, many Russians think that this holiday is Russia's Independence Day, but the holiday has never had such a name in official documents. According to the survey of Levada Center in May 2003, 65 percent of the respondents named the holiday as the Independence Day of Russia.

It is on Lake St. Clair east of Windsor and had a population of 23,229 at the 2016 census. It is part of the Windsor census metropolitan area, and is a part of the Windsor-Essex County region along with Amherstburg, Kingsville, Lakeshore, LaSalle and Leamington. Tecumseh enjoys long summers and mild winters. Originally a small Franco-Ontarian settlement, Tecumseh now offers many restaurants, shopping areas, medical facilities, as well as industrial and commercial enterprises. Food processing is a major industry in Tecumseh, as Bonduelle owns a food processing plant near the heart of the town. The plant originally was Green Giant 1931 (Fine Foods of Canada) and Pillsbury Company. Green Giant sold in the late 1990s to Family Tradition Foods. Family Traditions sold the food processing plant to Carri√®re Foods in 2006. Carri√®re Foods was then purchased in 2007 by Bonduelle. The Tecumseh Corn Festival has been recognized as one of the Top 50 Festivals in Ontario by Festivals and Events Ontario, which is quite an honour considering over 3000 festivals taking place in Ontario each year. Tecumseh is surrounded by Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River. Detroit is easily accessible to Tecumseh residents by the Ambassador Bridge or the Detroit‚ÄìWindsor Tunnel, both of which are located within the neighbouring municipality of Windsor. History In 1792, Tecumseh, then known as Ryegate Postal Station, had only three families. Ryegate Postal Station was renamed in 1912 during the death centennial of Tecumseh, leader of the Shawnee Tribe who was killed at battle in the War of 1812. Tecumseh had a large Franco-Ontarian population. When nearby Windsor started to grow into the area, there arose conflict between the Loyalists and the Canadiens. The creation of Tecumseh Road in 1838 and the establishment of the Great Western Railway opened up the area for settlement. The town became an important railway depot and stopover for travellers. County residents took horse and buggy into Tecumseh and then transferred onto the train, journeying by rail the rest of the way into Windsor. Several hotels were started in Tecumseh to accommodate travellers. The Bedell Hotel, the Soulliere Inn, the Hebert and the Hotel Perreault were some of the places most frequented by travellers and locals alike. The French were for the most part the original settlers of Tecumseh, the majority of them descendants of the Frenchmen who had established their seigneural land holdings along the banks of the Detroit River in 1700s. As the Town of Windsor grew, Tecumseh began to experience new blood when the overflow of immigrants coming to the city began to settle in the peripheral regions as well. Indicative of the change was the mix-up created by the introduction of the tomato to the area of Tecumseh. Many of the English residents of the community refused to touch the suspicious red vegetable believing it to be a ‚Ä≥Love Potion‚Ä≥ concocted by the amorous Frenchmen. The first post office was located on the northeast corner of Tecumseh and Lesperance Roads and was operated by a Mr. Christie. Some of the first businesses in Tecumseh included a lumber mill operated by J.B.Cada; a grocery store operated by Arthur Cecile; a cheese factory on Banwell Road operated by Joseph Breault; a bakery owned by John Dugell; three butcher shops; a canning factory and a brewery eventually closed under Carling Brewery. In 1921 it was felt that Tecumseh was not getting its fair share of improvements in proportion to the taxes paid to the municipality of Sandwich East. A group of people headed by Malcolm Clapp petitioned the legislature to separate from the township and incorporate as the Town of Tecumseh with a population of 978. Dr. Paul Poisson was appointed as the first mayor of the town. The real growth in Tecumseh occurred in 1931 with the establishment of the Green Giant Factory as Fine Foods of Canada. Green Giant (now Bonduelle) is still located in Tecumseh and continues to employ full and part-time workers. As the population grew, so did the demands for services. The Ontario Provincial Police started policing the Town in 1948 with 2 officers. In 1922 a fire chief was appointed although no fire department was in existence, the fires were fought by town volunteers. In 1999, as part of a reorganization of Essex County, Tecumseh was merged with the Village of St. Clair Beach, and the Township of Sandwich South into the Town of Tecumseh. In 2003, the City of Windsor annexed approximately from the Town of Tecumseh. Now considered to be a bedroom community of Windsor, Tecumseh is often cited as an example of urban sprawl; new subdivisions have developed on some of Canada's most valuable agricultural land beginning in the late 1980s. Communities Besides the town proper of Tecumseh itself, the town of Tecumseh comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including Fairplay, Maidstone, Oldcastle, Paquette, Paquette Corners (partially) and St. Clair Beach (formerly from Maidstone Township).

Early years  The Path√© record business was founded by brothers Charles and √âmile Path√©, then owners of a successful bistro in Paris. In the mid-1890s, they began selling Edison and Columbia phonographs and accompanying cylinder records. Shortly thereafter, the brothers designed and sold their own phonographs. These incorporated elements of other brands. Soon after, they also started marketing pre-recorded cylinder records. By 1896 the Path√© brothers had offices and recording studios not only in Paris, but also in London, Milan, and St. Petersburg.  Path√© cylinders and discs  Columbia \\"Eagle\\". In 1894, the Path√© brothers started selling their own phonographs. The earliest Path√© offerings were phonograph cylinders. Path√© manufactured cylinder records until approximately 1914. In addition to standard size cylinder records (), Path√© produced several larger styles. The \\"Salon\\" records measured 3¬Ω inches in diameter and the larger \\"Stentor\\" records measured 5 inches in diameter. The \\"Le C√©leste\\" records, the largest commercial cylinder records manufactured by any phonograph company, measured 5 inches in diameter by 9 inches long. In 1905 the Path√© brothers entered the growing field of disc records. They needed to employ several unusual technologies as preventive measures against patent infringement. At first they sold single-sided discs with a recording in wax on top of a cement base. In October 1906 they started producing discs in the more usual manner with shellac. Even with this less eccentric material, the early Path√© discs were unlike any others. The sound was recorded vertically in the groove, rather than side-to-side, and the groove was wider than in other companies' records, requiring a special ball- shaped stylus for playing. The discs rotated at 90 rpm, rather than the usual 75 to 80 rpm. Originally, the groove started on the inside, near the center of the disc, and spiraled out to the edge. In 1916, Path√© changed over to the customary rim-start format, a more nearly normal 80 rpm speed, and paper labels instead of the stamped-in, paint-filled text previously used. Path√© discs were commonly produced in 10 inch (25 cm), 10 inch (27 cm), and 11 inch (29 cm) sizes. 6 (17 cm), 8 inch (21 cm), and 14 inch (35 cm) discs were also made, as were very large 20 inch (50 cm) discs that played at 120 rpm. Due to their fragility, unwieldiness, and much higher price, the largest sizes were a commercial failure and were not produced for long. Hungarian Path√© record In France, Path√© became the largest and most successful distributor of cylinder records and phonographs. These, however, failed to make significant headway in foreign markets such as the United Kingdom and the United States where other brands were already in widespread use. Although Path√© cylinder records were never popular outside France, their disc records sold successfully in many foreign countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Russia. Path√© was the first company to make master recordings in a different medium than the final commercial product. In the Path√© recording studios, masters were cut on rapidly spinning wax cylinders that measured about 13 inches long and 4 ¬Ω inches in diameter. Beginning in 1913, special \\"Paradis\\" cylinders about 8 inches in diameter and 8 ¬Ω inches long were used. The large, fast-spinning cylinders allowed for a greater level of audio fidelity. The various types of commercial Path√© cylinders and discs were then dubbed (or \\"pantographed\\") from these masters. This dubbing process enabled copies of the same master recording to be made available on multiple formats. The process sometimes resulted in uneven results on the final commercial record, causing a pronounced rumble or other audio artifacts. (This rumble was generally undetectable on acoustic wind-up phonographs of the period, but is noticeable on electric and more modern equipment.) The vertically-cut Path√© discs normally required a special Path√© phonograph equipped with a sapphire ball stylus. The advantage of the sapphire ball stylus was its permanence. There was no need to change a needle after every record side. Since most records and phonographs used a different playback method, various attachments were marketed that allowed one to equip a Path√© phonograph to play standard, laterally-cut records. Attachments were also sold to equip a standard phonograph to play Path√© records. In 1920, Path√© introduced a line of \\"needle- cut\\" records, at first only for the US market. The needle-cut records were laterally-cut discs designed to be compatible with standard phonographs, and they were labelled Path√© Actuelle. In the following year, these \\"needle-cut\\" records were introduced in the United Kingdom and within a few more years they were selling more than the vertical Path√©s, even on the continent. Attempts to market the Path√© vertical-cut discs abroad were abandoned in 1925, though they continued to sell in France until 1932. In mid-1922, Path√© introduced a lower priced label called Perfect. This label became one of the most popular and successful \\"dime store\\" labels of the 1920s, and survived beyond the end of the US Path√© label - discontinued in 1930 - right up to 1938. In January 1927, Path√© began recording using the new electronic microphone technology, as opposed to the strictly acoustical-mechanical method of recording they used until then. In December 1928, the French and British Path√© phonograph assets were sold to the British Columbia Graphophone Company. In July 1929, the assets of the American Path√© record company were merged into the newly formed American Record Corporation. The Path√© and Path√©-Marconi labels and catalogue still survive, first as imprints of EMI and now currently EMI's successor Parlophone Records. The film division of Path√© Fr√®res still survives in France.

Located on the Bay of Quinte, it is the starting point for the Trent-Severn Waterway, which continues northwest to Peterborough and eventually Port Severn on Georgian Bay. History The Trent River was known to the Mississauga as Sangichiwigewonk, or 'fast flowing.' It was re- named after the River Trent in England. French explorer Samuel de Champlain followed the Trent passing through Trenton in 1615. The area around the mouth of the Trent River was first settled by Europeans in the 1780s. Assorted settlements and town plots in the area went under a number of names, until the Village of Trenton was incorporated in 1853. Trenton grew thanks to its port location and the area's lumber industry. During the First World War, the town was home to a major munitions plant owned by the British Chemical Company. This facility was built in 1915 to manufacture artillery, rifle, and small arms ammunition. Three weeks before the Armistice, an explosion levelled the plant. Remains of the old plant can still be found today. Trenton was also an important film production centre. In 1917, a film studio was built in the town and a number of productions were filmed there.\\"The History of the Canadian Film Industry\\" . The Canadian Encyclopedia. In 1923, the Trenton Film Plant was purchased by the Ontario government to house the studio and laboratory of the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau. The advent of talkies and 16mm film made the equipment at the film plant obsolete and the facility closed in 1934. The construction of a RCAF Station Trenton, a major Royal Canadian Air Force base just east of Trenton, started in 1929 and continued through the 1930s. This provided a major economic boost to the area through the Great Depression, the Second World War and later. Trenton was incorporated as a city in 1980. On January 1, 1998, Trenton was amalgamated with the Village of Frankford and the Townships of Murray and Sidney to form Quinte West. Home to nearly half the population of Quinte West, Trenton is the largest community within the municipality, and is one of Ontario's largest unincorporated settlements. Economy Canadian Forces Base Trenton/8 Wing, located on the east side of the town, is an important facility for the Royal Canadian Air Force's transport and search and rescue operations, and is Trenton's main employer. Other large employers include Trenton Cold Storage, Norampac, Pentair Thermal Controls, Nestl√©, ElectroCables, Domtech, Global Med Inc. (Schauenburg), Mckesson Canada and DECA Cables. Tourism also plays an important role in the economy, given Trenton's location as the southern entry point for the Trent‚ÄìSevern Waterway. From 1917‚Äì1920, The Parker Bros. Textile Mill was a movie studio, which dubbed Trenton \\"Hollywood North\\". Transportation Lock One on the Trent-Severn Waterway at Trenton Highway 401 crosses the Trent River on the north side of the town. Hastings County Road 2 (formerly Ontario Highway 2) is the main east‚Äìwest route through town leading towards Brighton in the west and to Belleville in the east. The main north‚Äìsouth route is Hastings County Road 33 (formerly Ontario Highway 33), leading towards Picton to the south and Stirling to the north. Canadian Pacific and Canadian National main railway lines (Toronto ‚Äì Ottawa/Montreal) pass through the city. Via Rail offers limited passenger service to and from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal via Kingston to Trenton Junction station. Trenton Airport is co-located with CFB Trenton on the east side of town. Trenton is the starting point for the Trent‚ÄìSevern Waterway and two locks (Lock 1 and Lock 2) are located in the community.Angus, James T. A Respectable Ditch: A History of the Trent-Severn Waterway 1833‚Äì1920. McGill-Queens University Press, Montreal and Kingston, 1988. Trenton also has a local public transit system, run by Quinte Access. It runs an hourly schedule Monday to Friday and limited service on Saturday (no Sunday Service, check for holidays) with Chevrolet Arboc specialized buses with ramps for wheelchairs. Several private firms also provide dispatched taxi services. Climate Recreation and culture Trenton is located on the Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail. Surrounding Trenton, there are numerous conservation areas, a YMCA, campsites, picnic grounds, and marinas. The area has nine golf courses, three ice hockey rinks, numerous soccer fields, bowling, many kilometres of walking trails, a dog park, curling rinks and baseball diamonds, amongst many other recreational activities. Trenton also serves as a gateway to Prince Edward County, south of the Bay of Quinte. This area is becoming increasingly well known for its vineyards, camping, beaches and boating. The city is home to the Trenton Golden Hawks a junior hockey team that plays in the OJHL. Trenton is the site of the National Air Force Museum of Canada. It features an original RAF Halifax Bomber, the 75th RCAF time capsule, a Lockheed CC-130E Hercules, and many other aircraft and exhibits. The museum is presently restoring an Avro Lancaster bomber. Every summer CFB Trenton also is home to over one thousand Royal Canadian Air Cadets who attend two-week Familiarization Courses, three-week Introductory Specialty Courses, and six-week Advanced Specialty Courses, and has special staff positions for more senior cadets. These summer courses introduce the cadets to a military learning environment. Most camps here also go on trips to the airport, the Air Museum, and other relevant places. Trenton is a hot spot for sport fishing. Popular freshwater fish in the Bay of Quinte and the Trent River include walleye (pickerel), bass, pike, perch, and mudcat. During particular times of the year, salmon and rainbow trout can be caught in the Trent River and in cold-water streams in the area. Each year in May, the Kiwanis Club of Trenton holds the Annual Live Release Fishing Derby, attracting thousands of sport fishermen from around North America with major prizes for tagged fish and heaviest weighed walleye and Northern pike. In 1990, Canadian poet Al Purdy (who received the Order of Canada and the Governor General's award) published his only novel A Splinter In The Heart. It takes place entirely in Trenton and provides a historical look at the town. It mentions many of the landmarks in the city (Mount Pelion, The Bridges, Trent River, etc.) and documents the period of the town directly before and after the huge munitions plant explosion of 1918. Purdy also wrote a poem entitled \\"At the Quinte Hotel\\" about the strip club in Trenton called The Sherwood Forest Inn.
