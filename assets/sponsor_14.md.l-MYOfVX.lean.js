The Orson Welles Cinema was a movie theater at 1001 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts that operated from 1969 to 1986. Showcasing independents, foreign films and revivals, it became a focal point of the Boston-Cambridge film community. History Ad in The Real Paper (June 13, 1973). Note the premiere of Ilene H. Lang’s short about famed Cambridge photographer Elsa Dorfman, At Home, Elsa Dorfman (1973), with Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky. The Orson Welles Cinema opened April 8, 1969 with Luis Buñuel’s Simon of the Desert, Orson Welles’ The Immortal Story and a midnight movie, Don Siegel’s Invasion of the Body Snatchers.The Harvard Crimson (April 8, 1969): \\"Parade, City Council Proclamation Greet New Orson Welles Cinema\\", by Frank Rich Originally the Esquire Theater in the early 1960s,The Harvard Crimson (January 9, 1964): \\"Esquire Theatre: Cinema Opening Here Soon\\" it became the Orson Welles Cinema under its next owner, folk musician Dean Gitter. It was programmed by then-Harvard Law student Peter Jaszi. On September 29, 1970, the cinema was raided by Massachusetts State Police for showing Oh! Calcutta! on video. Gitter, Jaszi, and Ted Uzzle, among others, were arrested, and spent the night in the Cambridge jail.The Crimson, September 29, 1970. The case would later be literally laughed out of court. When Gitter departed, the new owners were Molly and Ralph Hoagland (previously a co-founder of the CVS Corporation). From 1971 to 1978 the theater was managed and programmed by Larry Jackson, who later held positions with Miramax, Orion Pictures and the Samuel Goldwyn Company. The theater was purchased by Herbert and Philip Meadow and managed by Phil Meadow through the early and mid-1980s. In 1972–73, the Orson Welles Cinema expanded with two smaller screening rooms in addition to the main 400-seat auditorium. Jackson, who worked with Gary Graver and Welles on The Other Side of the Wind, succeeded in getting Welles to visit the cinema named in his honor. Welles and his cameraman Graver used the occasion--the premiere of F For Fake on January 7, 1977--to shoot footage inside the large auditorium for their documentary Filming Othello (1978).The Harvard Crimson: \\"H for Hype\\" (January 13, 1977) by Mark T.

At first, it was famous for requiring strangers sitting at the same table to order the same meal. The chef was Odette J. Bery, who later wrote Another Season Cookbook: Recipes for Every Season from the Chef/Owner of Boston’s Another Season Restaurant (Globe Pequot, 1986). In his autobiography, comedian Jay Leno notes that he performed in the Orson Welles Restaurant during his early days as a stand-up comic.Leno, Jay. Leading with My Chin. New York: HarperCollins, 1996. After the Welles Restaurant closed, the two-level space became Chi-Chi's, part of the Mexican restaurant chain. The Orson Welles Cinema came to an end with fire caused by a popcorn maker at 2 pm on Saturday, May 24, 1986. The last three films shown were Henry Jaglom’s Always, Dick Clement’s Water and Dennis Potter’s Dreamchild. Operations Vintage Hitchcock is a 13\\" x 18\\" poster designed by Jean Fogle for a month-long Alfred Hitchcock series held in 1973 at the Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Orson Welles Cinema’s advertising and promotion were under the direction of John Fogle,Promosis.com: John Fogle - VP/Creative Director with ad and poster copy written by Fogle and Larry Jackson. The Welles Cinema’s posters were designed by Jean Fogle. Extra runs of these posters were sold in the lobby. Among Fogle’s outstanding creations was Vintage Hitchcock, a 13\\" x 18\\" poster she designed for a month- long Hitchcock series held in 1973. Film notes for each showing were prepared by staffer John Rossi, who for each film gathered lengthy cast and crew credits, a partial synopsis and selected film reviews. These were prepared in the upstairs offices of the complex, as was the black-and-white digest-sized Orson Welles Cinema Magazine. Science Fiction Film Marathon In February 1976, the Welles launched its 24-hour Science Fiction Film Marathon with The Day of the Triffids, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, Fantastic Voyage, Five Million Years to Earth, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), It Came from Outer Space, Them!, The Thing from Another World (1951), The Shape of Things to Come, This Island Earth, The War of the Worlds, and Zardoz.Cambridge Chronicle film critic Ed Symkus on the history of the Science Fiction Film Marathon The Marathon became an annual event that continued even after the Orson Welles Cinema closed. Following the 11 Marathons held at the Orson Welles, the film series moved on to other Boston theaters, and under the name Boston Science Fiction Film Festival it is now held annually on President’s Day weekend at the Somerville Theatre in Davis Square, Somerville.Boston Science Fiction Film Festival official site First Boston Film Festival Less successful was the Welles’ Boston Film Festival (1976), which included such films as Monty Python's Flying Circus, And Now For Something Completely Different and Jacques Rivette’s Out One: Spectre. However, according to Welles Cinema staffers, many of the announced films arrived late or never appeared. Legacy The Orson Welles Cinema on Massachusetts Avenue a few days after a fire that reportedly started in a popcorn machine caused it to close in May 1986 Film personalities associated with the Orson Welles Cinema include the first house manager, future actor Tommy Lee Jones, during the spring of his senior year at nearby Harvard University. Producer-screenwriter John Semper (Class Act, Spider-Man) was an employee, as was the Brazilian film composer Pancho Sáenz, future writer-director Martha Pinson and future sound editor David E. Stone. The career of writer-producer Fred Barron began in 1975 when he used the history of Cambridge’s The Real Paper as the basis for a screenplay, Between the Lines. When Joan Micklin Silver brought Hester Street (1975) to the Welles Cinema, she was joined at the Welles Restaurant by Barron and others. When someone asked what she would direct next, she answered that she was looking at screenplays. Barron stood up, left the restaurant and returned with his screenplay. The success of Between the Lines (1977) led to a short-lived television series, also titled Between the Lines. On January 2, 1975, Nicholas Ray appeared at the Welles for a Q&A; session after the showing of the David Helpern documentary, I’m a Stranger Here Myself. Other filmmakers and musicians who made personal appearances or visited at the Welles Cinema included Peter Bogdanovich, Edward Dmytryk, Ed Emshwiller, Jean Eustache, Gary Graver, Jean-Pierre Léaud, Jim McBride, Vincente Minnelli, Nicholas Ray, George A. Romero, Harold Russell, François Truffaut, Orson Welles and Neil Young. After Steven Lisberger premiered his Cosmic Cartoon (1973) at the Welles, the animated short received a Student Academy Award nomination,Tron Bonus Disc and he went on to make Animalympics and Tron. Rob Morris, former film intern, busboy, and waiter (for the restaurant next door) started a two- man company that created the first commercial multimedia computer system in the mid 1980s.

Anatomy  Shows the sub-areas of the clitoris. Areas include clitoral glans, body, crura. Also shows vestibular bulbs and corpora cavernosa The two corpora cavernosa are expandable erectile tissues which fill with blood during clitoral erection. These formations are made of a sponge-like tissue containing irregular blood-filled spaces lined by endothelium and separated by connective tissue septa. United together along their medial surfaces by an incomplete fibrous pectiniform septum; each corpus is connected to the rami of the pubis and ischium by a clitoral crus. The female anatomy has two vestibular bulbs beneath the skin of the labia minora (at the entrance to the vagina), which expand at the same time as the glans clitoridis to cap the ends of the corpora cavernosa. This is homologous with the corpus spongiosum of the male anatomy.  Physiology  In some circumstances, release of nitric oxide precedes relaxation of the clitoral cavernosal artery and nearby muscle, in a process similar to male arousal. More blood flows in through the clitoral cavernosal artery, the pressure in the corpora cavernosa clitoridis rises, and the clitoris is engorged with blood. This leads to extrusion of the glans clitoridis and enhanced sensitivity to physical contact.

In February 2012, it claimed a membership of 268. Politics , the primary political positions of the ERL were opposition to building the planned Nord Stream pipeline through the Baltic Sea, dislike for Estonia being a member state of the European Union, support for a NATO military base being installed in Estonia and disdain for the Estonian Centre Party's perceived improper acts. The movement has also repeatedly expressed displeasure for the Russian Federation's covert influence in Estonia's internal affairs. On June 20, 2007, the movement issued a press release demanding declaring the Russian Ambassador to Estonia, Nikolai Uspenski, a persona non grata based on his repeated attempts to exert such influence. This was triggered by the ambassador's presence at an establishment meeting of Russki Mir in Tallinn. In February 2012, it was announced that the movement would merge with the People's Union of Estonia to form the Estonian Conservative People's Party.

The yard was established in 1961 by Toralf Westermoen, who had also started Westermoen Båtbyggeri og Mek Verksted. The yard began producing hydrofoil craft under license from Italian Supramar. The first boat, Westfoil, with a top speed of 38 knots, was finished in 1962 and was delivered to the Bahamas. After that, a number of small and large (models PT20 and PT50) hydrofoils were built for passenger traffic in western Norway, in the Oslofjord, Øresund, Bahamas and in Greece. Towards the end of the 1960 they built the world's then-largest hydrofoil, the \\"Expressen\\", that could carry 250 passengers. The boat did not achieve the intended design speed of 38 knots, and the contract was annulled. This was the beginning of the end of the hydrofoil epoch in Mandal. After this, development of a new class of high speed vessel, the catamaran, began. The Westamaran type, constructed by commander Harald Henriksen and introduced in 1973,Westamaran Store Norske Leksikon, retrieved 23 March 2013 was very successful, and a new era of high speed craft in Norway and elsewhere was begun.NOU 1994:9:Om sikkerhet og forhold som har betydning for norsk hurtigbåtnæring Regjeringen.no, retrieved 23 March 2013 Towards the end of the 1980s the yard changed name to Westamarin. Westamarin closed in the end of the 1990s. One of the final ships produced was a single High-speed Sea Service HSS 900 catamaran for Stena Line in 1997. The shipyard went bankrupt shortly afterwards, leading to Stena Line being unable to claim compensation for corrosion later found to the aluminium alloy hull on the vessel (Stena Carisma).

Poisoning refers specifically to chemical deactivation, rather than other mechanisms of catalyst degradation such as thermal decomposition or physical damage. Although usually undesirable, poisoning may be helpful when it results in improved catalyst selectivity (e.g. Lindlar's catalyst). Poisoning of Pd catalysts Organic functional groups and inorganic anions often have the ability to strongly adsorb to metal surfaces. Common catalyst poisons include carbon monoxide, halides, cyanides, sulfides, sulfites, phosphates, phosphites and organic molecules such as nitriles, nitro compounds, oximes, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Agents vary their catalytic properties because of the nature of the transition metal. Lindlar catalysts are prepared by the reduction of palladium chloride in a slurry of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) followed by poisoning with lead acetate. In a related case, the Rosenmund reduction of acyl halides to aldehydes, the palladium catalyst (over barium sulfate or calcium carbonate) is intentionally poisoned by the addition of sulfur or quinoline in order to lower the catalyst activity and thereby prevent over-reduction of the aldehyde product to the primary alcohol. Poisoning process Poisoning often involves compounds that chemically bond to a catalyst's active sites. Poisoning decreases the number of active sites, and the average distance that a reactant molecule must diffuse through the pore structure before undergoing reaction increases as a result.Charles G. Hill, An Introduction To Chemical Engine Design, John Wiley & Sons Inc., 1977 , page 464 As a result, poisoned sites can no longer accelerate the reaction with which the catalyst was supposed to catalyze.Jens Hagen, Industrial catalysis: a practical approach ,Wiley-VCH, 2006 , page 197 Large scale production of substances such as ammonia in the Haber–Bosch process include steps to remove potential poisons from the product stream. When the poisoning reaction rate is slow relative to the rate of diffusion, the poison will be evenly distributed throughout the catalyst and will result in homogeneous poisoning of the catalyst. Conversely, if the reaction rate is fast compared to the rate of diffusion, a poisoned shell will form on the exterior layers of the catalyst, a situation known as \\"pore-mouth\\" poisoning, and the rate of catalytic reaction may become limited by the rate of diffusion through the inactive shell. Selective poisoning If the catalyst and reaction conditions are indicative of low effectiveness, selective poisoning may be observed, where poisoning of only a small fraction of the catalyst's surface gives a disproportionately large drop in activity. If η is the effectiveness factor of the poisoned surface and hp is the Thiele modulus for the poisoned case: : \\\\eta =\\\\frac{\\\\tanh h_{\\\\rm p}}{h_{\\\\rm p}} When the ratio of the reaction rates of the poisoned pore to the unpoisoned pore is considered: : F =\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\alpha} \\\\tanh \\\\left (h_{\\\\rm T} \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\alpha} \\\\right) }{\\\\tanh h_{\\\\rm T}} where F is the ratio of poisoned to unpoisoned pores, hT is the Thiele modulus for the unpoisoned case, and α is the fraction of the surface that is poisoned. The above equation simplifies depending on the value of hT. When the surface is available, hT is negligible: : F = 1 - \\\\alpha This represents the \\"classical case\\" of nonselective poisoning where the fraction of the activity remaining is equal to the fraction of the unpoisoned surface remaining. When hT is very large, it becomes: : F = \\\\sqrt{1- \\\\alpha} In this case, the catalyst effectiveness factors are considerably less than unity, and the effects of the portion of the poison adsorbed near the closed end of the pore are not as apparent as when hT is small. The rate of diffusion of the reactant through the poisoned region is equal to the rate of reaction and is given by: : \\\\vec{v}_{\\\\rm diffusion} = -\\\\pi \\\\langle r^2 \\\\rangle D \\\\vec{ abla} c And the rate of reaction within a pore is given by: : v = \\\\eta \\\\pi \\\\langle r \\\\rangle (1-\\\\alpha) \\\\langle L \\\\rangle k_1 c_{\\\\rm c} The fraction of the catalyst surface available for reaction can be obtained from the ratio of the poisoned reaction rate to the unpoisoned reaction rate: : F =\\\\frac{v_{\\\\rm poisoned}}{v_{\\\\rm unpoisoned}} or : F = \\\\frac{\\\\tanh[(1-\\\\alpha) h_{\\\\rm T}]}{\\\\tanh h_{\\\\rm T}} \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\alpha h_{\\\\rm T} \\\\tanh[(1-\\\\alpha) h_{\\\\rm T}]} Benefits of selective poisoning Usually, catalyst poisoning is undesirable as it leads to the wasting of expensive metals or their complexes. However, poisoning of catalysts can be used to improve selectivity of reactions. Poisoning can allow for selective intermediates to be isolated and desirable final products to be produced. Hydrodesulfurization catalysts In the purification of petroleum products, the process of hydrodesulfurization is utilized. Thiols, such as thiophene, are reduced using H2 in order to produce H2S and hydrocarbons of varying chain length. Common catalysts used are tungsten and molybdenum sulfide. Adding cobalt and nickel to either edges or partially incorporating them into the crystal lattice structure can improve the catalyst's efficiency. The synthesis of the catalyst creates a supported hybrid that prevents poisoning of the cobalt nuclei. Other examples * In catalytic converters used in automobiles, tetraethyllead is converted into elemental lead which alloys with the metals present in the catalyst, reducing the converter's ability to reduce NOx emissions. * In fuel cells using platinum catalysts, the fuels must be free of sulfur and carbon monoxide, unless a desulfurization system is used. * Ziegler-Natta catalysts for the production of polyolefins (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene, etc) are poisoned by water and oxygen. This poisoning applies to both homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization. This requires the monomers (ethylene, propylene, etc.) to be purified.

In the 7th century came Avars and then Slavs. The first mention of that village comes from 14th century (1393) called 'Wamuslehutaya' it means toll (duty) village. In 1467 'Wamosfalva' and in 1773 had nearly the present name but with i 'Mitna'. That name likely comes from 1423 when there was just several houses, and the toll house which served to pay a toll (duty) because of using the way from Zvolen to Lučenec. 2 km away lies the Castle of Divin which took the toll. In 1467 Mýtna already belonged under the Castle. Gradual settlement in the Valley of Kriváň creek came from the north and northwest and was completed settlement in the surrounding mountains in the 19th and 20th century. The village at present introduces an entrance gateway for traveling in the northwest region of Novohrad.

Cracht in 1636.Abraham van Beijeren at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He lived in Leiden in 1638-1639 where in 1639 he married Emmerentia Stercke. He was back in The Hague in 1640 where he became a master of the local Guild of Saint Luke. River view After the death of his first wife he was left to raise three daughters. He married with Anna van den Queborn in 1647. His second wife was a painter and daughter of the painter Crispijn van den Queborn. Anna's aunt was married to Pieter de Putter, a painter of fish still lifes. De Putter may have been the source of van Beijeren's initial interest in the genre of fish still lifes as well as his tutor in this genre.Walter A. Liedtke, Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volumes 1-2, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1 Jan, 2007, p. 31-32 Still Life with Haddocks and Plaice Van Beijeren's initial works were marine and fish still life paintings. These were not very well paid at the time and the relative poverty of van Beijeren may explain his frequent moves from one place to another. He resided in Delft from 1657 where he joined the local Guild of Saint Luke. In 1663 he returned to The Hague where he remained until 1669 when he moved to Amsterdam. Further moves followed: to Alkmaar in 1669, then Gouda in 1675 and finally Overschie (Rotterdam) in 1677. This was his last home. The artist may have been doing better financially in his later years as he was able to buy a house in Overschie for 1,000 guilders of which 600 was covered by a mortgage. His wife was reported as being sick in bed in 1679 when she made her will. The date of her death is unknown. Van Beijeren died in Overschie in 1690. Work Van Beijeren signed his canvases with the monogram AVB and invariably failed to include a date. As a result, it has been difficult to compile a precise chronology of his works. Still-Life with Landscape, 1650s While in the 1640s most of his paintings were seascapes, van Beijeren began to develop as a skilled still life painter of fish. In his early marine paintings he shows the influence of Jan van Goyen. In the 1650s and 1660s he started to focus on pronkstillevens, i.e. still lifes with fine silverware, Chinese porcelain, glass and selections of fruit. He also painted a number of floral still life paintings, dead bird paintings and vanitas paintings. The move to painting pronkstillevens may have been motivated by economic necessity as they could be sold to a wealthier clientele. These still lifes are often quite elaborate displays and show the influence of Jan Davidsz. de Heem. He generally used a fairly broad technique and brown tonalities with some precision of detail. Van Beijeren was likely familiar with the other Dutch painters of pronkstillevens such as Pieter Claesz and Willem Claeszoon Heda who were specialists in monochrome banquet still lives. He often worked on a larger scale than his Dutch contemporaries with his tall canvasses reaching a height of one meter.

Everything that happens for campers is informed by the Galileo Innovation Approach (affectionately known as the “GIA”). Drawing heavily from the innovation process inspired by the Institute of Design at Stanford, Galileo runs an evolving series of programs for kids. The GIA is a distillation of everything kids need to learn to envision and create a better world—the mindset, the knowledge and the process. Since its founding, Galileo has served more than 500,000 kids across the Bay Area, Southern California and Illinois with more than 70 locations. In 2012, Galileo became certified as a B-Corporation. In addition, the company founded its Innovation for All initiative which aims to provide full and partial scholarships to kids in the areas it serves who otherwise would not be able to attend camps. In 2019, Galileo offered more than 10,000 scholarships to families in need. In April 2020, Galileo was ranked as one of the Bay Area Best Places to Work 2020, marking the organization's eleventh consecutive year on the list by the San Francisco and Silicon Valley Business Times. Camp Galileo received criticism in June 2019 for allowing a 5-year-old child to walk away from camp unnoticed at one of its camps. The camp did not realize the child went missing until hours later when the parents of the child arrived for pickup. Since then, Galileo expanded its safety protocols to ensure the unprecedented event did not happen again. Due to the global pandemic, Galileo was forced to cancel its traditional in-person camps scheduled for the spring and summer of 2020. Because of the COVID-19 epidemic, Camp Galileo strategically filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2020 to reorganize the company with plans to continue operating. In lieu of cash refunds, Galileo offered enrolled families credits to be used for future camp sessions and products, and also launched Camp Galileo Anywhere, a comprehensive set of online classes, resources.

The event took place on January 8, 1981, outside the town of Trans-en- Provence in the French departement of Var. It was described in Popular Mechanics as \\"perhaps the most completely and carefully documented sighting of all time\\".  Event details  The case began on January 8, 1981 at 5pm. Renato Nicolaï, a 55-year-old farmer,National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena: UFO Casebook:1981 heard a strange whistling sound while performing agricultural work on his property. He then saw a saucer-shaped object about eight feet in diameter land about away at a lower elevation. According to the witness, \\"The device had the shape of two saucers, one inverted on top of the other. It must have measured about 1.5 meters in height. It was the color of lead. This device had a ridge all the way around its circumference. Under the machine I saw two kinds of pieces as it was lifting off. They could be reactors or feet. There were also two other circles which looked like trapdoors. The two reactors, or feet, extended about below the body of the machine.\\"UFO Evidence: Renato Nicolai; Trans en Provence, France Nicolaï claimed the object took off almost immediately, rising above the treeline and departing to the north east. It left burn marks on the ground where it had supposedly sat. The local gendarmerie were notified of the event the following day by Nicolaï directly on the advice of his neighbor's wife, Mrs. Morin.UFO Skeptic.org: UFO Case 4: The Trans-en-Provence Case The gendarmerie proceeded to interview Nicolaï, take photos of the scene, and collect soil and plant samples from the field. The case was later sent to GEIPAN—or GEPAN (Groupe d'Étude des Phénomènes Aérospatiaux Non-identifiés) as it was known at that time—for review.  Analysis of evidence  GEPAN analysis noted that the ground had been compressed by a mechanical pressure of about 4 or 5 tons, and heated to between . Trace amounts of phosphate and zinc were found in the sample material, and analysis of resident alfalfa near the landing site showed chlorophyll levels between 30% and 50% lower than expected.  Impressions and explanations  Nicolaï had initially believed the object to be an experimental military device. The close proximity of the site to the Canjuers military base makes such a theory generally plausible. However, GEPAN's investigation focused on conventional explanations, such as atmospheric or terrain causes of a terrestrial nature. But despite a joint investigation by GEPAN and the gendarmerie which lasted for two years no plausible explanation was found.  Analysis  Some French scientistsRossoni, D., Maillot, E., & Déguillaume, E. (2007). Les ovnis du CNES – 30 ans d’études officielles. www.book-e-book.com. (extracts from the book) . Critical skeptical investigations of GEPAN's work. insist that the GEPAN investigation was flawed, especially the study of the physical trace.Figuet, M. (Ed.) (1995). L’affaire de Trans-en-Provence. Dompierre-les-Ormes, SERPAN. The police report said that the trace, which appeared on an active road, looked like one made by the tire of a car. This explanation was dismissed by GEPAN because of the sole witness saying otherwise. The physical trace shown on the picture is not a perfect circle, in fact there are two more-or-less semicircles crossing over each other. Also, a circular shape does not coincide with the description of the UFO made by Nikolaï. In an interview for French television, Nikolaï confirmed that there were vehicles passing by on the road at the time of the sighting.

In 1961, the book was translated into English by Edouard Roditi, thus gaining Kemal his first exposure to English-speaking readers. Plot Memed, a young boy from a village in Anatolia, is abused and beaten by the villainous local landowner, Abdi Agha. Having endured great cruelty towards himself and his mother, Memed finally escapes with his beloved, a girl named Hatche. Abdi Agha catches up with the young couple, but only manages to capture Hatche, while Memed is able to avoid his pursuers and runs into the mountains. There he joins a band of brigands and exacts revenge against his old adversary. Hatche was then imprisoned and later dies. When Memed returns to the town, Hatche's mother tells him he has a \\"women's heart\\" if he surrenders himself. He instead rides into town to find his enemy, on a horse given to him by the townspeople. He finds Agha in the south-east corner of his house and shoots him in the breast. The local authorities hear the gunshots, but Memed gets away. Before Hatche dies she gives birth to Memed's son, who is also named Memed. The protagonist then must take care of his son.

It served in West Virginia before being transferred to the Western Theater. Initial infantry service The 17th Indiana was organized at Indianapolis, Indiana, and mustered on June 12, 1861. It left the state for Parkersburg, West Virginia, on July 1, 1861, and was subsequently attached to the District of the Kanawha until September, 1861. Cheat Mountain District, W. Va., to November, 1861. Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed John T. Wilder as the lieutenant colonel of the 17th Indiana Infantry Regiment three months after the regiment was organized. On March 2, 1862, Wilder became the regiment's colonel, replacing Milo Hascall, who became a general. Conversion to mounted infantry  In December 1862, the regiments colonel, John T. Wilder was promoted to command of the 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, Center, XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland. After fruitless attempts to chase down rebel cavalry raiders on foot, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The regiment voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles. Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 17th chose Spencer repeating rifles, invented by Christopher Spencer, as their weapon.A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution As part of the \\"Wilder Lightning Brigade\\" the 17th was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the Spencer repeating rifle. After intense training and development of new tactics, the \\"Lightning Brigade\\" was ready for service. The mounted infantry proof of concept for the Army of the Cumberland occurred in their first mounted infantry action at the Battle of Hoover's Gap.Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloffhttp://howcanamandiebetter.com/the- lightning-brigade Despite torrential rains, the 17th and its brigade gained the gap so quickly that they surprised and scattered surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at breakfast in front of the entrance of the gap.National Park Service battle description The 17th drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit. The massive superiority of firepower the 17th and its brethren had with the Spencers allowed them to entrench and hold the southern entrance against numerous assaults by numerically superior rebel infantry and artillery through the rainy day until the sodden remainder of the XIV Corps slogged to join them at their position. With the Lightning Brigade, the 17th found itself detached from the XIV Corps to serve as a mobile reserve for all three of the Corps within the Cumberland. After playing a key role in the feint that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the Chickamauga Campaign. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at Chickamauga. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. The performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps. The 17th and the 98th Illinois Mounted Infantry were assigned to 2nd Brigade under Colonel Eli Long of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps under Major General George Crook. On 1 October, the 17th joined the rest of the Cavalry Corps operating against Wheeler's rebel cavalry, then in the Sequatchie Valley. On 3 October in a night attack at Thompson's Cove, the regiment routed the 2nd Brigade of Kelly's Division, capturing a number of arms and the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry's colors The next day it drove more elements of Wheeler's horsemen out of McMinnville. Regaining contact with the enemy on 7 October beyond Shelbyville, the 17th drove the enemy from the field and into Parmington. When the rebels attempted to make a stand, the regiment charged and took three of Wheeler's guns, a great number of small arms, and 300 prisoners. The regiment regrouped with the 998th Illinois in Huntsville, AL until 13 October, when it started in pursuit of enemy cavalry again.

Qhichwa Simipi (monolingual Quechua and bilingual Quechua-Spanish dictionary) or from Aymara jamp'atu, both meaning \\"frog\\") is a dormant stratovolcano in the Andes of southern Peru. It lies about northwest of Arequipa and is part of a north-south chain that includes the volcanoes Hualca Hualca and Sabancaya, the last of which has been active in historical time. Ampato consists of three volcanic cones, which lie on top of an older eroded volcanic edifice. They were formed sequentially by extrusion of lava flows, but Ampato has also had explosive eruptions which have deposited ash, lapilli and pumice in the surrounding landscape. One young lava flow has been dated to 17,000 ± 6,000 years before present, but a summit lava dome is even younger, and Holocene ash layers in surrounding peat bogs may testify to the occurrence of recent eruptions. The present-day volcano is covered by an ice cap, and during the last glacial maximum glaciers advanced to low altitudes. In 1995, an Inca mummy known as Mummy Juanita was discovered on Ampato by Johan Reinhard; it had been offered as a human sacrifice more than six hundred years earlier on the mountain.  Geography and geomorphology  Ampato lies south of the Colca Canyon and at the southern end of a chain of volcanoes formed by Hualca Hualca and Sabancaya, the last of which has been historically active. Clockwise from northeast the towns of Colihuiri, Cajamarcana, Sallalli, Japo, Baylillas, Corinta and Collpa surround the volcano; the city of Arequipa lies to the southeast. Ampato is part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, which in Peru manifests itself as several dozen Pleistocene volcanoes, some of which erupted in historical time including El Misti, Huaynaputina, Sabancaya and Ubinas. The largest historical eruption of the Andes took place at Huaynaputina. Other volcanoes in the Peruvian Central Volcanic Zone are Sara Sara, Solimana, Coropuna, Chachani, Ticsani, Tutupaca, Yucamane and Casiri. Ampato seen from west The volcano Ampato consists of three individual steep- sided cones which rise from a gentle glacially eroded foot. These three cones are lined up in southwest-northeast direction and the highest one reaches an elevation of or . Ampato is one of the highest volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone and the 35th highest summit in the Andes. The summit of the volcano is covered with an ice cap, and the edifice is incised by glacial valleys. The volcano is surrounded by three sets of moraines, the lowermost one at elevation has been attributed to the last glacial maximum between 25,000-17,000 years ago, the middle one between to a late readvance at the Pleistocene-Holocene epoch boundary and the higher ones above to Holocene advances.  Geology  Off the western coast of South America, the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate at a rate of . This subduction process is responsible for volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone and started during the Jurassic period after the opening of the southern Atlantic Ocean, which triggered the onset of subduction of the Nazca Plate. Volcanic arc- associated volcanism originally occurred within the Cordillera de la Costa in the Jurassic, but later it migrated resulting in the emplacement of the Tacaza and Toquepala groups and finally the Neogene Barroso group. The present-day volcanic arc is situated in the area of the Barroso group but has a narrower extent. The basement beneath Ampato is formed by sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Western Cordillera of Peru, and the rocks are of Mesozoic to Cenozoic age. A high plateau formed by ignimbrites and lavas of Pliocene to Miocene age rises above this basement. The terrain is cut by several different fault systems; one of these, the northeastward striking Sepina fault has been seismically active in the 20th and 21st centuries and seems to have controlled the development of the Ampato and Sabancaya volcanoes.  Composition  Ampato has erupted different volcanic rocks at different stages, with the earliest ones generating andesite and dacite and which define a potassium-rich suite. The rocks contain amphibole, biotite, iron oxide, olivine, plagioclase, pyroxene and titanium oxide. Processes such as fractional crystallization, magma mixing and the absorption of crustal material by developing magmas have been invoked to explain the formation of the magmas of both Ampato and Sabancaya. Estimating the rate of magma production at Ampato is difficult owing to the uncertainties in determining the volume of the edifice and the duration of repose times between eruptions; on average it appears to be . This rate does not consider \\"spurt\\"-like behaviour; volcano growth in fits and spurts has been observed at many other volcanic arc volcanoes.  Vegetation  The Western Cordillera features various climate zones, such as the quechua and suni zones. The vegetation that occurs at high altitudes is dominated by pioneer plants, with wetlands constituting additional centres of biodiversity.  Eruptive history  A thick pile of andesitic lava flows with additional scoria and which crops out on the southern, southeastern and southwestern side of the Ampato volcano is the oldest volcanic stage of this volcano, with argon-argon dating yielding ages between 400,000 - 450,000 years before present. Above this formation, another pile of dacitic lava flows constructed the first Ampato edifice, which was about the same size as the present-day volcano. This pile (\\"Moldepampa stage\\") is about thick in outcrops and was emplaced between 230,000 - 200,000 years before present. After a pause in volcanic activity and an intermediary stage (\\"Yanajaja stage\\"; one date obtained on this stage is 77,000 ± 4,000 years before present) that produced andesitic-dacitic lava flows which form a thick unit on top of eroded remnants of the older Ampato volcanics, the andesitic northern cone formed as the first of the three present-day cones. The southern cone developed in several different stages; a first stage generated lava flows emanating from the summit; dating of two such flows has produced ages of 34,000 ± 8,000 and 40,000 ± 3,000 years before present. More than of block-and-ash flows was erupted onto the eastern and western flanks of Ampato, and these flows consist of one andesitic and one dacitic formation; both appear to relate to a lava dome forming stage of volcanic activity. These block-and-ash flows are themselves covered on both the eastern and the western flanks by more thick lava flows, which make up a thick unit and again consist of one andesitic and one dacitic unit; both units appear to have been erupted during the last glacial maximum. Either during or before the last glacial maximum, Ampato erupted tephra during multiple explosive eruptions which today is preserved in two units, the Baylillas and the Corinta deposits. The first consists of lapilli, pumice and scoria and individual layers form thick sequences at large distances from the volcano, but are heavily eroded and thus difficult to measure in extent. Scoria flows identified on the southwestern-southern flanks of Ampato correspond to this unit. The dacitic Corinta deposits conversely were created during one large eruption which also left a crater on Ampato; it generated stratified thick tephra deposits which contain pumice embedded within ash-rich layers, and it is probably also the source of the pumice flow deposits on the south-southwestern flank. These contain dacitic pumice fragments in a matrix rich in ash and have thicknesses of more than in the few outcrops; much of this unit was likely eroded away by glacial activity.Aerial view of Ampato (back) from the northeast, with the active volcano Sabancaya in front. The central cone grew in the gap between the northern and southern edifice and consists of lava flows again of andesitic to dacitic composition. These flows are together maximally thick and one flow has been dated to 17,000 ± 6,000 years before present. A dacitic summit lava dome is not affected by glacial erosion and appears to be the youngest eruption product of Ampato. Early Holocene (11,000 - 8,000 years before present) ash layers in peat bogs around the volcano may have originated either on Ampato or on Sabancaya. Late Holocene tephra layers dated to 1,790 ± 110, 2,050 ± 70 and 4,500 ± 125 likewise may have been erupted from Ampato, but Sabancaya is a more likely source for these ash layers.  Hazards  Presently, Ampato is considered to be a dormant volcano. Potential hazards from future eruptions at Ampato are lahars induced by melting of the icecap and sub-Plinian eruptions, considering the history of explosive eruptions at this volcano. The Peruvian geological service has published a hazard map that describes danger areas of both Ampato and Sabancaya. Hazards mapped include both the fall of ash and the formation of lahars which can advance to distances of in the southerly valleys of Ampato. Pyroclastic fallout primarily threatens the vicinity of the volcano but large eruptions can result in fallout over large areas around the volcanic complex.  Human history  Ampato was the site of human sacrifice during Inca times, when about 1466 the Mummy Juanita was offered for sacrifice on the mountain, along with two other girls and a boy. The sacrifice took place on a platform on the summit of the volcano and was presumably intended to calm the mountain spirits during an eruption of the neighbouring volcano Sabancaya. The mummies were discovered in 1995 by Johan Reinhard and colleagues on the summit of the mountain. Such sacrifices with children being the usual subjects are known as capacocha and the discoveries of their mummies on mountains in the Andes has gained them a lot of attention. The process served to tie the Inka empire more closely together, since children to be sacrificed were selected from the entire realm and the children adorned and their names remembered after the sacrifice.

It is about an eight-grade girl named Rune Ayanokouji, who is destined to save the world from peril caused by notorious cyber-alien beings. Plot Rune lives with her mad scientist grandfather, who is very smart, but has a habit of dressing her up in weird cosplay outfits. Rune was born with a sun-like crest on her wrist (known as the Crest of the Sun), and was told by her grandfather that she was the reincarnated Space Queen. Rune refuses to believe almost anything her grandfather says and tries to live a normal life, despite the fact that she works part-time as a cybernetic superhuman to ward off alien beings that have invaded the earth. Rune's childhood friends, Masaya and Masato Ibayashi, are also cybernetic warriors who bear the Crest of the Sun, but she doesn't know this until later in volume one. It is also revealed that her other close friend, Aina Hazumi, is also a Crest-bearer. A horde of cybernetic aliens hail from Planet X to dominate the earth, and they ensure that their plans are carried out successfully. Many of them are disguised as humans in order to conceal their identities. These alien forces are under the command of Emperor Gald, the mastermind behind the domination of Earth. In the beginning of the series, Gald is \\"asleep\\"—he hasn't been awakened to his full power yet. During this time, the aliens are trying to revive him so that he can lead them to their victory. There are five certain objects needed in order to destroy the aliens' operation. These are the six Elements of the Sun. Each piece resembles one part of Sun Crest (five points and a central core). Each one must be obtained before the aliens are able to steal them. In the meantime, another trio of aliens arrive on earth from Planet X. It turns out they're actually on a mission to protect Rune and defeat the evil horde of aliens. They disguise themselves as humans and go along with pseudonyms. Rune happens to befriend one of these aliens, but doesn't know that he is undergoing an important mission.  Characters  ;Rune Ayanokouji: The heroine of the story. She hates the way her grandfather acts, and wakes up almost every morning dressed in strange cosplay outfits. She is a bearer of the Sun Crest, and is told that she is the reincarnation of the Space Queen. She has a part-time job of fighting aliens with a Veena-Alpha battlesuit. One day, she comes across a cute pink creature, and decides to name him Chat-kun, and brings him home with her. ;Masaya and Masato Ibayashi: These are the two twin brothers in the story. Masaya is the older twin, and the one who pilots the powerful Beta-Max powersuit while fighting off aliens. After a malfunction with Beta-Max, he and his younger twin, Masato decide to take turns piloting the powersuit. They are also Rune's childhood friends and classmates. These two also bear the Crest of the Sun on their wrists. In volume three, it is revealed that Masato is a clone of Masaya, and in volume four, it reveals that the Space Queen hid her DNA inside of Masato's body. ;Aina Hazumi: Rune's female friend and classmate. She is an expert at using Tarot cards and tries to convince Rune about the problems of the real world, even though it seems Rune isn't interested in them. She is revealed to bear the Crest of the Sun on her ankle in volume two. ;Chat-Kun: This is the pink, blobby little creature in the story. He has the Sun Crest on his belly. Although he nearly always makes the sound \\"cha!\\" he also makes other unusual sounds such as \\"puni\\" and \\"mii\\". ;Professor Ayanokouji: Rune's grandfather, a smart, but bizarre scientist. He's the one who analyzes and calculates things, as well as dresses Rune up in strange Space Queen cosplay outfits each morning. ;Professor Ibayashi: The scientist father of Masaya and Masato. He's been quite competitive against Professor Ayanokouji, even though they've been lab partners and friends many years ago. ;Quark: This is the alien that arrived from Planet X to Earth to find and protect the Space Queen. He is a strong, alien warrior and he fights with a neutrino saber. He and his two companions all transformed into humans as part of their mission on Earth. However, due to a malfunction in the transformation device they used, Quark turned into a female human instead of male. As he goes on with his mission, he seems to care much about it, and takes on the pseudonym, Akira Shingyoji. After saving Rune from an explosion, Rune befriends Akira, totally unaware of his true identity. Akira attends Rune's junior high school as a student in disguise, to ensure the safety of Rune. ;Gluon: He is one of Quark's dependable companions. After activating the transformation device, he turned into a male human. He helps keep watch over the evil aliens to make sure their plans to dominate Earth don't progress. He takes the pseudonym Seiji. ;Plasma: He is yet another one of Quark's companions, and also keeps check over the aliens. He too, turned into a male human. He takes the pseudonym Keiichi. ;Noema and Noeshisu: These two are the cat-like cybernoids that have stolen the secret \\"numbers\\" to activate a grand summoning system. They seem to be making a lot of progress, but nobody in the alien Empire seems to think much of them. ;Delta-Chronos: He is one of the Empire's top cybernoid aliens, and is very tough. However, after leaving Akira for dead in volume three, Rune defeats him. He returns in volume four. ;Thunder-Mu: She is the Empire's toughest female cybernoid alien. She was supposed to collect an Elemental piece from Rune and her friends in volume two, thus failing, and being destroyed by Chat-kun. ;Grand Wizard Fractal: He is the old man who is part of the Empire and keeps watch over the evil aliens' steady progress to ensure that nothing interferes with it. ;Ishtar: She is the programmed girl who the Empire needs to awaken many alien comrades, all of whom are hiding among human DNA. In volume three, Ishtar is the user of VR City, which simulates the Ishtar System, which is revealed to be on Planet X in volume four. Ishtar is also a computer virus. ;Emperor Gald: He is the leader of the Empire and the boss that has been hiding in a physical human body since the aliens failed their last invasion a decade ago. He is awakened and summoned in volume two, and begins to wreak havoc in VR City in volume three. In volume four, it is revealed that he is a neural network and the Space Queen's true love. ;The Space Queen: The ruler of all the cosmos, with her great will and power. With the Crest of the Sun on both wrists, she chose six \\"warriors\\" to fight the evil aliens. Her secrets are revealed in volume four. ;Aurora: Aurora is another alien from Planet X. She is a scientist and has been called to travel to Earth and fix the damaged transformation device that Gluon, Plasma, and Quark used. It is revealed in volume four that she and Quark are genetic siblings.  Cybernetic Units  The Cybernetic suit and units in the series are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, PSI, Zeta, and Omega. The alpha unit appears to be used mostly by females such as Rune, whereas the beta unit appears to be used mostly by males, like Masaya and Masato. The other letters of the alphabet shown up in volume four during the final invasion. Quark's cybernoid is an early model of Zeta-Omega. Due to Quark being a clone of Emperor Gald, Gald is also under the Zeta-Omega unit, which explains why Quark would have died after entering Gald's net.  The Ishtar System  This is the virtual city that entraps, Rune, Quark, Aurora, Masaya, Masato, and the Student Council. The member of the school's Student Council created this network. The aliens betrayed them and sent them into the city. They all try to work their way to the \\"exit\\". Ishtar is the user controlling the city. Throughout the city, monstrous creatures known as VR City Hunters pop up and attack. When Rune gets attacked by a Hunter, Quark shows up and saves her. However, Rune gets taken away by Ishtar and nearly dies from the senses of the Ishtar System. She is then stuck in an empty space in which she meets the Space Queen. The Student Council members later come across an area known as the \\"perception space\\", which draws from a person's subconsciousness and presents them with their strongest emotions. The lead member of the Student Council gets lost and she meets up with Masaya, who later finds out that Masato is a clone. Soon afterward, Rune is revived, and she and Quark battle against the forces of the Ishtar System, and everyone trapped inside the net are finally able to escape.  The Six Warriors  The Space chose six people from Earth to fight the newly awakened Gald. She made them each bear the Crest of the Sun. In volume one, Rune bore the Crest on her wrist. Masaya had borne it on his right wrist, and Masato had it marked on his left wrist. In volume two, Aina revealed to have the Crest on her ankle. In volume four, it revealed amidst the battle that Quark had the Crest on it wrist, then later revealed that Chat-kun was also a \\"chosen one\\", due to the Crest on his belly.  The Truth About Gald and the Space Queen  According to book four, Gald was a program created by the Space Queen, who was able to sneak some of his DNA and transform him into a human being with it. The Space Queen fell deeply in love with Gald, which created Ishtar, who is merely the Space Queen's feelings. Ishtar became a virus and made Gald powerful. After the failure of the last invasion decades ago, the Space Queen sent a message to ordinary people of the Earth, including Rune's grandfather, and they have all responded. The Space Queen then chose warriors to fight and defeat the invasion. Just as she puts an end to the battle, she tells Rune to help transform Ishtar. Ishtar becomes a baby human. Gald completely changes and assures the Space Queen that he will raise and protect Ishtar, as well as protect the Earth from future peril.  The Six Elements  According to volume two, the six Elements together resemble the Crest of the Sun. The Core makes up the center and is the most important part, while the five Elemental spokes surround it, supporting it with power. Each of the chosen warriors make up the Elements, Rune being the Core, and the Elements are needed to start the Great Attractor by the aliens. The heroes must collect all the Elemental pieces in order to prevent them from falling into the aliens' hands. There are, of course, six characters who bear the crests: Rune, Masaya, Masato, Aina, Quark, and Chat-kun.

It may be a variant spelling of two Chinese surnames ( Léi and Lǚ), as well as an Italian surname. The surname Lui can also be found on various Pacific Islands. Origins Lui may be the spelling of various Chinese surnames, based on their pronunciation in different varieties of Chinese; they are listed below by their spelling in Hanyu Pinyin, which reflects the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation: *Léi (), meaning \\"thunder\\"; the spelling Lui is based on the Cantonese pronunciation (). The spelling Lui is common in Hong Kong, while other spellings of the same surname such as Loi and Louie are found in Macau and among overseas Chinese. *Lǚ (); nearly-homophonous with the above in Cantonese (; note the differing tone), and so also spelled Lui, Loi, or Louie. Lui is also an Italian surname, derived from the name of the month of July in the Eastern Lombard dialect spoken in Mantua and surroundings (compare Italian ). Statistics In Italy, 287 families bore the surname Lui, with 200 (69.7%) located in Lombardy. According to statistics cited by Patrick Hanks, there were 488 people on the island of Great Britain and 18 on the island of Ireland with the surname Lui as of 2011. There were no people with the surname on the island of Great Britain in 1881. The 2010 United States Census found 6,156 people with the surname Lui, making it the 5,641st-most-common name in the country. This represented an increase from 5,620 (5,662nd-most-common) in the 2000 Census. In both censuses, about nine-tenths of the bearers of the surname identified as Asian, and roughly five per cent as White.

The village lies on a slope between Great Hinton and Bulkington. Semington Brook forms much of the northeast boundary of the parish. In the far north of the parish, on the A361, is the hamlet of The Strand.  History  A settlement of 42 households at Chivele was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, when the land was held by Ernulf de Hesdin. His son, also Ernulf, held the manor in 1130; it passed through various hands until it was sold in 1560 by Henry, Earl of Arundel to Richard Lambert, a grocer of London. His brother's grandson sold the manor to William Beach in 1681. In 1790 the estate was inherited by Henrietta Maria Beach; she married Michael Hicks of Beverstone Castle, Gloucestershire, who took the additional surname of Beach. Their grandson W.A. Hicks Beach sold the property in 1911. Two mills were recorded in the Domesday Book and two, presumably the same, were granted to Romsey Abbey by Ernulf. These were on the Semington Brook, one at Gayford (upstream of Bulkington near the present Mill Farm) and the other near Baldham Bridge (in the northeast of Keevil parish). Although there were other mills on the brook, only these two survived into recent times. The Gayford mill was used for clothworking until the early 20t century, while that at Baldham was a water-powered flour mill in 1965 and is now a residence. A school was built in the village in 1868, at the expense of Mrs Chamberlaine, the vicar's wife, and by 1894 was also attended by children from Bulkington. Children of all ages were educated until 1941, when those over 11 transferred to schools in Trowbridge. The school gained voluntary controlled status in 1950, and continues as Keevil Church of England Academy.  Religious sites   Parish church  St Leonard's Church There was a church at Keevil in the late 11th century, which was granted to Shaftesbury Abbey by Ernulf de Hesdin. In 1393 the rectory and advowson were conveyed to the Bonhommes of Edington Priory. After the Dissolution, in 1541, the rectory and advowson were granted to Winchester Cathedral, and this continues to the present day. The oldest parts of the present Church of England parish church of St Leonard are single-light lancet windows from the late 13th century, in the north and south walls of the chancel. The church was extended and enlarged in the 15th and early 16th centuries, when the south aisle was added; the building was restored in the 1860s and c. 1910. The organ was installed in 1909. There is a 14th-century sanctus bell and a ring of six bells, including two dated 1609 and two dated 1761 by Thomas Bilbie II. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1968. In 1869 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners described the benefice as \\"the vicarage of Keevil with the chapelry of Bulkington annexed\\". A small church, Christ Church, was built in 1860 to serve the tithing of Bulkington, in the east of the parish, which became a separate civil parish in the 1880s while remaining part of Keevil ecclesiastical parish. This connection was broken in 1971 when Bulkington was united with Seend parish. Keevil last had a resident vicar in 1970; from 1972 the benefice was held in plurality with Steeple Ashton. Today the benefice is united with St James, Trowbridge.  Early church  The site of the 11th- century church may have been in the area known as Cooplechurch field, about half a mile east of Steeple Ashton church. Foundations and nearby burials were excavated in 1913; the site is now within the airfield and nothing is visible.  Methodist chapel  Methodists met in Keevil from 1783, and by 1829 there was also a congregation at Bulkington. A red brick chapel was built in 1833 in the northeast of Keevil village, to which a Sunday schoolroom was added in 1901. The chapel closed in 1988 and became a private house. Landmarks The parish has two Grade I listed buildings, both in the centre of the village. Keevil Manor, across the road from the church, was built c. 1580 for the Lambert family. Two stories and an attic are faced with limestone ashlar at the four-gabled front, while a central two-storey porch of 1611 carries Tuscan columns. English Heritage describe the house as \\"a fine example of a Wiltshire manor house retaining especially rich fittings\\". Also Grade I listed are the boundary wall to Main Street, of c. 1600, about two metres in height, with gate piers at the southwest entrance and an arched doorway in line with the manor's porch; and an inner garden wall in front of the house, probably 1611. The second Grade I listed house, Talboys, is described by Pevsner as \\"A timber-framed house of great charm and value, although some of its features are deceptive\\". The centre and right (west) wing are late 14th century to mid 15th but the left wing was added in 1876 to match; the whole was restored in 1899. The former vicarage, Field Head, today a private residence, was built in 1842 by Reverend Pooke and enlarged in 1869. In the western part of the village are several timber-framed houses including Little Talboys, a cruck- framed house with four bays. The Trowbridge–Devizes section of the A361 crosses the north of the parish. At the parish boundary in the northeast the road crosses Semington Brook at Baldham Bridge; there has been a bridge here since the 14th century but the present two-arched ashlar bridge is from the mid 18th. After the Second World War, the barracks of RAF Keevil were used as a temporary home for Polish refugees. Today the small Ministry of Defence airfield is used for gliding at weekends, being the base of Bannerdown Gliding Club.

Historically part of Lancashire, Openshaw was incorporated into the city of Manchester in 1890. Its name derives from the Old English Opinschawe, which means an open wood or coppice.http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/districts/openshaw.html During the Second Industrial Revolution, when Openshaw become an area of heavy industry, socialism and trade unionism flourished. In 1910 the Openshaw Socialists were formed; Keir Hardie, founder of the Labour Party, spoke at their inaugural meeting. Annie Lee became Manchester's first socialist woman alderman in 1936, having been secretary of the Openshaw Independent Labour Party since the 1890s. Following profound de-industrialisation, Openshaw's population is now a fraction of what it was a century ago. Industry There is little industry in the district now. Very large enterprises such as a government munitions factory (ordnance works) and associated railway yards were closed after the First World War. Companies which employed thousands of people, but of which nothing remains, include RHM, Ferguson, Pailin & Co (later GEC Switchgear), the English Steel Corporation, B&S; Massey and Crossley Brothers, and the Gorton Works of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, later the Great Central Railway followed by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Gorton works exemplified the industries that sustained the economy of Openshaw and adjacent districts of Manchester during and after the Second Industrial Revolution.Gorton locomotive works were not related to the Beyer, Peacock and Company's Gorton Foundry. It was established in 1848 to service locomotives and build carriages and wagons. The first locomotive was built in 1858 and by 1923, Gorton works had built more than 900 locomotives. The last steam engine was built for British Railways in 1950. The works then produced electric locomotives until it closed in 1963. The site is now the New Smithfield Wholesale Market, Manchester's wholesale fruit and vegetable market.Location: . Openshaw is, however, within the East Manchester Regeneration Scheme and new businesses are moving into the area. Education There are four primary schools in Openshaw: Higher Openshaw Community Primary School, St Barnabas' CE Primary School, St Clement's CE Primary School and Varna Community Primary School. Openshaw has no high school; Wright Robinson College in Gorton and Fairfield High School for Girls in Droylsden are nearby. The Openshaw Campus of The Manchester College on Whitworth Street near Ashton Old Road (A635) specialises in new technical and industrial training, including construction craft and building services, motor engineering and computer technology. Lime Square redevelopment As part of the area's redevelopment under the East Manchester Regeneration Scheme, a new shopping precinct has been built called Lime Square. The majority of Lime Square is taken up by a Morrisons supermarket that was built in 2010, with The Range also in the same unit. It is also home to The Gym Group, McDonald's fast food restaurant, a doctors' surgery, several charity shops, a B & M, Greggs, Farmfoods, Savers, Poundland, Costa Coffee, and a Betfred bookmaker's, among others.

The Eagle Wing left Groomsport in 1636 and was over half way there when they turned back. (The Mayflower sailed in 1620). thumb Robert Blair (1593 – 27 August 1666) was a Scottish presbyterian minister who was excommunicated in 1634 but became a Westminster Divine and was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1646 after an unsuccessful attempt to emigrate to Boston in 1636. Robert Blair was born in Irvine, 1593, the sixth son of John Blair of Windyedge, a merchant-adventurer and cadet of Blair, and Beatrix Mure of the Rowallan family. He was educated at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an M.A. in 1612. He was appointed regent there in 1615 and licensed in 1616. In consequence of the appointment of John Cameron, to the Principalship, who favoured Episcopacy, Blair resigned his regency, went to Ireland on the invitation of Lord Claneboy, and was sometime minister of a Presbyterian congregation at Bangor. He was ordained thereto by Robert Echlin, Bishop of Down and Connor, and some of the neighbouring pastors. Blair narrates that he was \\"very careful to inform him [Echlin] both of what accusations had been laid against me of disaffection to the civil powers, and that I could not submit to the use of the English liturgy nor Episcopal government. But he having been informed of my altercations with Dr Cameron, said, 'I know all that business,' and added that he was confident of procuring a free entry for me, which he quickly effectuated. . . . Having been invited to preach by the patron, and by Mr Gibson, the sick incumbent, I yielded to their invitation and preached there three Sabbath days. After that, several of the aged and most respectful persons in the congregation came to me by order of the whole, and informed me that they were edified by the doctrine delivered by me, and intreated me not to leave them. Likewise the dying man did several ways encourage me. He professed great sorrow for his having been a dean. He condemned Episcopacy more strongly than ever I durst do: he charged me in the name of Christ, and as I expected his blessing on my ministry, not to leave that good way wherein I had begun to walk, and then drawing my head towards his bosom with both his arms, he laid his hands on my head, and blessed me. Within a few days after he died, and my admission was accomplished as quickly as might be, in the following way. The Viscount Claneboy did, on my request, inform the Bishop how opposite I was to Episcopacy and their liturgy, and had the influence to procure my admission on easy and honourable terms. Yet, lest his lordship had not been plain enough, I declared my opinion fully to the Bishop at our first meeting, and found him yielding beyond my expectation. The Bishop said to me, 'I hear good of you, and will impose no conditions on you: I am old and can teach you ceremonies, and you can teach me substance, only I must ordain you, else neither I nor you can answer the law nor brook the land.' I answered him that his sole ordination did utterly contradict my principles; but he replied both wittily and submissively, 'Whatever you account of Episcopacy, yet I know you account a presbytery to have divine warrant; will you not receive ordination from Mr [Robert] Cunningham [minister at Holywood] and the adjacent brethren, and let me come in among them in no other relation than a presbyter!' This I could not refuse, and so the matter was performed,\\" 10 July 1623. Echlin, however, turned out to be his bitter enemy, and in September 1631, Blair was suspended from the exercise of his ministerial functions, the ostensible reason being that he had taken part (with John Livingston) in a celebration of the Lord's Supper at the Kirk of Shotts; and on 4 May 1632 he was deposed. Through the intervention of Charles I. sentence was removed in May 1634, but he was again deposed by Echlin in November that same year. He was now bent on emigrating to New England, but the ship in which he and other ministers, including John Livingstone, sailed was driven back by stress of weather, a sign, as Blair thought, that his services were still required at home. The next months were spent partly in Scotland and England, and an order for his apprehension being issued, he escaped to Scotland, and was admitted to the Second Charge of Ayr in July 1638. He was invited to go to France as chaplain to Colonel Hepburn's Regiment, but after embarking at Leith was threatened by a soldier whom he had reproved for swearing, and thereupon went ashore again. He petitioned the Privy Council for liberty to preach the Gospel and was admitted to St Andrews 8 October 1639. In 1640 he accompanied the Scottish army to England and assisted at the negotiations for the Peace of Ripon; pres. by Charles I. 8 November 1641. He preached in Ulster for three months during 1642, the Presbyterians there having petitioned the General Assembly for a supply of ministers after the Irish Rebellion of 1641. He attended Lord President Spottiswood and others to the scaffold in 1645. He was elected Moderator of General Assembly 3 June 1646. He was then appointed Chaplain-in-Ordinary to King Charles I. that year. He was also appointed by Commission of Assembly in 1648, one of a Committee to endeavour to get Cromwell to establish \\"a uniformity of religion in England.\\" On the division of the Church in 1650, he inclined to the Resolutioners and endeavoured to effect a union between them and the Protesters. He was summoned to London by the Protector in 1654, but excused himself on the ground of ill-health. He was named by the Council of England that year on the committee for authorising admissions to the ministry in Perth, Fife, and Angus. On the establishment of Episcopacy he was removed from his charge September 1661, confined to Musselburgh and subsequently to Kirkcaldy (where he was for three years and a half), and afterwards at Meikle Couston, parish of Aberdour, Fife, where he died 27 August 1666, and was buried in the churchyard of Aberdour. Life He was a native of Irvine, Ayrshire. His father was a merchant-adventurer, John Blair of Windyedge, a younger brother of the family of Blair of that ilk; his mother was Beatrix Muir (of the house of Rowallan), who lived for nearly a century. From the parish school at Irvine Blair proceeded to the University of Glasgow, where he took his degree of M.A. He is stated to have acted as a schoolmaster in Glasgow. In his twenty-second year he was appointed a regent or professor in the university. One of his students was the future author of polemics for the Covenanters, Robert Baillie. In 1616 he was licensed as a preacher of the gospel in connection with the established church (presbyterian) of Scotland. In 1622 he resigned his professorship. Having gone over to Ireland, he was called to Bangor, County Down, and ordained by Robert Echlin, the Bishop of Down, on 10 July 1623. But he was suspended in the autumn of 1631, and deposed in 1632 for nonconformity; Echlin had turned a blind eye in the 1620s to presbyterian clergy in his diocese, but Blair (on his own account) didn't react to hints by Theophilus Buckworth, Bishop of Dromore, and was then interviewed by James Ussher, who tried to persuade him with arguments current from John Sprint. By the intervention of the king, Charles I, he was restored in May 1634; but the former sentence was renewed, with excommunication, by John Bramhall, bishop of Derry, the same year. Excommunicated and ejected, Blair, along with others, fitted out a ship, intending to go to New England in 1635. But the weather proved so bad that they were beaten back, and, returning to Scotland, he lived partly in that country and partly in England. Orders were issued in England for his apprehension in 1637, but he escaped to Scotland, and preached for some time in Ayr. He was invited to go to France as chaplain to the regiment of Colonel Patrick Hepburn of Waughton, but after embarking at Leith he was threatened by a soldier whom he had reproved for swearing, and went ashore again. He also petitioned the privy council 'for liberty to preach the gospel,' and received an appointment at Burntisland in April 1638. He was nominated to St. Andrews in the same year, and was admitted there on 8 October 1639. In the Second Bishops' War of 1640 he accompanied the Scottish army on its march into England. He assisted in the negotiations for the treaty of peace presented by Charles I on 8 November 1641. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641 he once more went to Ireland with several other clergymen of the Scottish kirk, the Irish general assembly (presbyterian) having petitioned for supplies for their vacant charges. He afterwards returned to St. Andrews. In 1645 he attended the lord president Robert Spottiswoode and others to the scaffold. In the same year he was one of the Scottish ministers who went to Newcastle to speak very plainly to the king. In 1646 he was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland (3 June). Later, on the death of Alexander Henderson, he was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to the king, supported by the revenues of the Chapel Royal. The Commission of the General Assembly, in 1648, named him one of those for 'endeavouring to get Cromwell to establish a uniformity of religion in England.' At the division of the church, in 1650, into Resolutioners and Protesters, he leaned to the former, but lamented the strife. Summoned with others to London in 1654, that 'a method might be devised for settling affairs of the church,' he pleaded ill-health and declined to go. In the same year he was appointed by the council of England 'one of those for the admission to the ministry in Perth, Fife, and Angus.' At the Restoration he came under the notice of Archbishop James Sharp, had to resign his charge in September 1661, and was confined to certain places, first of all to Musselburgh, afterwards to Kirkcaldy (where he remained three and a half years), and finally to Meikle Couston near Aberdour. As a Covenanter he preached outdoors. He died at Aberdour on 27 August 1666, and was buried in the parish churchyard.

In Australia it is commonly known as kangaroo grass and in East Africa and South Africa it is known as red grass and red oat grass or as rooigras in Afrikaans. Description Themeda triandra is a grass which grows in dense tufts up to tall and wide. It flowers in summer, producing large red-brown spikelets on branched stems. The leaves are in length and wide but can exceed long and wide. Its inflorescence is compounded, fasciculated, is long and composed of a single raceme. It pedicels are oblong and are 0.5 mm long while its lemma is long and is both apical and geniculate. The column of lemma's awn is hispidulous and twisted. Taxonomy and naming Themeda triandra was first formally described in 1775 by Peter Forsskål who published the description in Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica. There are many synonyms of this species. The specific epithet (triandra) is the feminine of the Botanical Latin adjective triandrus, meaning 'with three stamens', p. 516. based on the Greek-derived combining forms tri-, three, and -andrus, male. Distribution and habitat Themeda triandra is found across Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific. In Australia, it is found in all of the states and territories. It grows predominantly in grassland and open woodland communities. It is a significant species in temperate grasslands in Australia, a habitat considered to be endangered or threatened in various parts of the country. It does not do well under heavy grazing pressure, but benefits from occasional fire. Uses The young growth is palatable to stock.Burbidge, N. T. Australian Grasses. Angus and Robertson Publishers. 1966. T. triandra seed has been used as a famine food in Africa. It also serves as a food source for several avian species, including the long-tailed widowbird. It is also occasionally used as an ornamental plant.

He graduated from the 31st class of the Army Staff College in 1919. After graduation, he held various staff positions, and from 1928 was an instructor of the Army Field Artillery School. In 1928, he was promoted to the honorific title of Senior Sixth Court Rank『官報』第535号「叙任及辞令」October 5, 1928.

He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1939. After a brief stint at the Army Aviation Technology Research Institute, he was given a field command as the commander of the newly-formed IJA 56th Division from August 1940. Although initially the 56th division was slated as reinforcements for the Japanese invasion of Malaya, the rapid cessation of British resistance resulted in division been attached to IJA 25th Army and sent to Burma in March 1942, landing in Rangoon and participating in the Battle of Toungoo. The 56th Division linked with the IJA 55th Division in Toungoo on 28 March 1942. Its reconnaissance elements forced the Chinese to evacuate the city opening the way to the east. Later the 56th Division flanked the Allied line to the east, by advancing through the mountains to the Salween River in the Karenni States. The Division defeated the Chinese 6th Corps in the Karen Hills area battles of Mawchi on 13 April 1942, Bawlake, Taunggyi and Loikaw on 20 April 1940,World War II database: Invasion of Burma and forced their retreat eastward to Yunnan.

In Spain, the battle is better known as the Battle of Estremoz. D. Sancho Manuel, commander of the Portuguese Army in the battle, portrayed in 1673-5 by Feliciano de Almeida (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) In the spring of 1663, the Spanish had undertaken their most successful attack on Portugal, since the beginning of the war. Under command of John of Austria the Younger, son of Philip IV of Spain (and the conqueror of Catalonia and of the Kingdom of Naples and winner of the French in Italy), the greater part of the south of Portugal was overrun. The important city of Évora was taken on 22 May, opening perspectives for a march on Lisbon, to the west. But the lack of ammunition, food and money paralysed the Spanish army. The Portuguese raised a 17,000 men strong army led by Sancho Manoel de Vilhena, aided by Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg, Fernando de Meneses, Count of Ericeira and other senior officers, and marched against the Spanish.Rui Natário, As Grandes Batalhas da História de Portugal, Marcador Editora, Barcarena, 2013 (in oortuguese) The Spanish commander decided to retreat to a strategic position at the north east of Évora and wait for the enemy, leaving a garrison of 3,700 in Évora. The Portuguese army was reinforced by three regiments (1 cavalry & 2 infantry) of about 3,000 troops, from England (mostly from around the British isles) which were put under the command of the Duke of Schomberg. Also included were a small number of mercenaries from France. Of this foreign contingent, almost 2,000 English fought in Ameixial, about 1600 incorporated in the infantry and 300 in the cavalry. The standard of Don John of Austria was captured when his squadron was almost totally killed.Great Britain Royal Manuscripts, pp. 111-12 The standard was later presented to King Afonso VI of Portugal himself. The Spanish casualties were very high, all of their artillery and baggage was captured, and the army was forced to retreat to Badajoz in Extremadura. When the Spanish garrison of Évora of 3,700 men capitulated on 24 June 1663, the whole expedition was a complete failure. The independence of the Kingdom of Portugal was saved while the military career of John of Austria ended. A memorial stone was placed on the site of the battlefield.H. V.

Anthrop. 1 : 1-121 (2008) In the 1960s he tried to decipher Carian inscriptions and proved that their language belonged to Anatolian languages. In the 1970s he emigrated to the United States. He is now a professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures and Linguistics at the University of Michigan. Shevoroshkin is also a leader in the study of language in prehistory (paleolinguistics), and in publicizing the recent work of paleolinguists, especially Russians. In 1988 he and Benjamin Stolz organized the First International Interdisciplinary Symposium on Language and Prehistory, at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. Forty-six scholars participated as presenters and discussants, sixteen of which were from Russia and other eastern European countries (or recently emigrated therefrom). This symposium led to renewed cooperation among historical linguists, archeologists, and physical anthropologists from East and West. Some of his work on remote linguistic relationship relationships and the hypothetical Proto-World language is controversial.  References   Books  * SHEVOROSHKIN, V.V. & T.L. MARKEY, Eds. 1986.

Judson Dance Theater 1962-64 At Judson, Summers shared in the ongoing experiments with chance methods and pedestrian, everyday movements as part of the interest in expanding the then accepted methods of creating and performing dances. However she also embraced the more theatrical part of the collective (as did Aileen Passloff, John Herbert McDowell and others). Elaine Summers expanded dance into other disciplines, experimental film, visual art, and body work. In the later phase of the Judson Dance Theater she created dances that would be made to work with the entire environment of the performance space, notably Country Houses (1963) which included speaking non-sequitor one-liners, and her solo-concert Fantastic Gardens (1964) which included the first large- scale use of intermedia, immersing the entire performance area in film- projections, multiplied by the audience with hand-held mirrors.Jonas Mekas, \\"Movie Journal\\", Village Voice, 27 February 1964, p. 12 References Sources * Banes, Sally, Democracy's body.

History A nurse at Park Prewett Hospital in 1941 Park Prewett was an enclosure dating back to the time of Edward I. Following a report by the Lunacy Commission into overcrowding at Knowle Hospital in the south of the county, a new site was required to house the expanding population. Park Prewett Farm was selected and then acquired in 1899. The hospital was designed by George Thomas Hine but, because of a delay caused by a reduction in demand for mental health services in the county, construction did not commence until 1913. The works which were carried out by Thomas Rowbotham progressed slowly because of shortage of labour during the First World War but were completed in 1917. The building was first used by the Canadian Army Medical Corps as a military convalescent hospital. It was known as 'Number Four Canadian General Hospital'. The facility re-opened as Park Prewett Mental Hospital in 1921 and catered for 1,400 patients by 1939. John Arlott worked as a records clerk at the hospital for four years, from 1930 till 1934. The hospital returned to military use again during the Second World War. Part of the hospital, Rooksdown House, was used by Sir Harold Gillies, the pioneering plastic surgeon. It was originally the private wing of the Asylum but became a plastic surgery unit in 1940. The facility joined the National Health Service as Park Prewett Hospital in 1948. Following the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s the hospital went into a period of decline and ultimately closed in 1997. Park Prewett was bought by English Partnerships in 2005. They appointed Taylor Woodrow as developers for most new building on the site, and Thomas Homes for conversion of many of the old hospital blocks into housing and community facilities. The new housing development was called \\"Limes Park\\" and formed the core of a new civil parish named Rooksdown. Railway line The hospital was served by its own railway line from 1913 until 1954 from a junction on the South Western Main Line west of Basingstoke railway station.

Many times, the owner of the animal will say \\"Fetch\\" to the animal before or after throwing the object. The game is usually played with a dog, but in rare instances cats, especially younger cats, have been known to engage in fetch behavior. Mathematics of Fetch A Spaniel fetches a stick Arizona State psychology professor Michael McBeath has proposed a simple model to explain how dogs play Fetch. By mounting a camera on the head of a dog, he found that the dog changed its speed and direction in order to keep the frisbee's image in a constant position on its retina. This approach, called the Linear Optical Trajectory, makes the frisbee appear to move in a linear path at a constant speed. McBeath had previously noticed this interception strategy in professional baseball players pursuing fly balls. Tim Pennings, a mathematics professor at Hope College, has found that dogs are somehow able to calculate the optimal path to a ball thrown in the water. While playing Fetch with his Welsh Corgi, he noticed that the dog ran along the beach for a certain distance before jumping into the water. Because the dog is faster on land, this technique minimizes the total retrieval time. He showed that the dog is able to calculate the optimal point to jump into the water with statistical significance, a problem Pennings must resort to calculus to solve. Perruchet and Gallego have demonstrated a method for calculating this optimal path using calculus in a different way. They propose that the dog optimizes its behaviour on a moment- to-moment basis, choosing at each moment the path that allows it to maximize its speed of approach to the ball. This requires the dog to be able to accurately estimate its speed on both land and water, but does not rely on the premise that the dog plans the entire route in advance.

He was shot dead by a Turkish sniper at Gallipoli, and was posthumously promoted to brigadier general when all brigade commanders in the Australian Imperial Force were thus promoted. Early life MacLaurin was born on 31 October 1878 in Sydney, Australia. He was the son of Sir Henry Normand MacLaurin, the chancellor of the University of Sydney. He was educated at Blair Lodge School, Polmont, Scotland; Sydney Grammar School; and the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts. MacLaurin was later admitted to the bar in New South Wales and became a barrister. Military career MacLaurin enlisted in the New South Wales Scottish Rifles while still at university and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1899. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1900, captain in 1903 and major in 1908. On 1 July 1913, he took command of the 26th Infantry Regiment. First World War On 15 August 1915, MacLaurin joined the Australian Imperial Force as a full colonel and given command of the 1st Infantry Brigade. MacLaurin was the youngest of the three original brigade commanders of the 1st Division, and more than ten years younger than any of his four battalion commanders. For a brigade major, he was given a British regular officer, Major Irvine of the Royal Engineers. MacLaurin's brigade was the last to come ashore at Anzac Cove. By this time a crisis was developing and Major General William Bridges was ordering units to fill gaps almost as soon as they arrived ashore. During the afternoon of 27 April 1915, when a Turkish counterattack threatened, Major Irvine collected 200 stray men in Monash Valley and was about to send them forward when the news arrived that the need for them had passed. Irvine went up to Steele's Post, where he observed the positions. He was warned about Turkish snipers, but brushed off the warnings and was quoted as saying \\"It's my business to be shot at\\".

Unaware of Irvine's fate, MacLaurin was in the act of warning soldiers to keep under cover when he too was shot dead, from the same point, possibly by the same Turkish sniper. MacLaurin was buried by his men near where he fell in a grave marked with a simple wooden cross.

Akua was seen as a close ally of President Marcus Stephen, whose government ceased to command the support of a majority in the Parliament of Nauru in March 2008. Akua's resignation was thus set in the context of strengthening the Executive by hindering the conduct of Parliamentary business, which, as widely acknowledged, would likely have led to the term of office of the Stephen Administration being ended by Parliament. In this sense, Akua's record as Parliamentary Speaker is seen as controversial and allegations of a coup d'état made by Akua's successor as Speaker, David Adeang, may be seen against this light.

Sirin), while living in Berlin and sojourning at resorts in the Baltic in 1928. It was published as Король, дама, валет (Korol', dama, valet) in Russian in October of that year; the novel was translated into English by the author's son Dmitri Nabokov (with significant changes made by the author) in 1968, forty years after its Russian debut. Plot summary Franz (Bubendorf), a young man from a small town, is sent away from home to work in the Berlin department store of his well-to-do uncle (actually, his mother's cousin), Dreyer. On the train ride to Berlin Franz is seated in the same compartment with (Kurt) Dreyer and Dreyer's wife, Martha, neither of whom Franz has met. Franz is immediately enchanted by Martha's beauty, and, shortly after Franz begins work at the store, the two strike up a secret love affair. As the novel continues Martha's distaste for her husband grows more pronounced, and with it her adoration for Franz. Franz, meanwhile, begins to lose any will of his own, and becomes a numb extension of his lover. Dreyer, meanwhile, continues to lavish blind adulation on his wife, and is only hurt, not suspicious, when she returns his love with resentment. As her relationship with Franz deepens, Martha begins to hatch schemes for Dreyer's demise. Franz himself has begun to lose interest in Martha, but he goes along with her plotting. As part of Martha's plans, the three vacation together at the Seaview Hotel at Gravitz, a resort on the Baltic Sea. She plans to take Dreyer, who cannot swim, out in a rowing boat so he can be drowned. On the boat, however, the plot is suspended by Martha when she learns from Dreyer that he is about to close a very profitable business deal. Martha then gets pneumonia from the rain and the cold on the boat. To Dreyer's great sorrow she passes away; he never learns about the betrayal and the danger he was in. Franz, relieved by her death, is heard laughing \\"in a frenzy of young mirth\\". Other characters in the novel are the \\"conjuror,\\" Old Enricht, who rents out a room to Franz, and the Inventor who was developing robot-like \\"automannequins\\" financed by Dreyer who hoped to make money by selling the invention to the American Mr. Ritter. The Inventor promised to make three dummies, however, at the final performance for Ritter, only the \\"elderly gentleman\\" with Dreyer's jacket and the woman (\\"walking like a streetwalker\\") were ready. The woman dummy crashed in a final clatter. Themes, foreshadowings One of Nabokov's favorite subjects, the doppelgänger theme, is enacted through the creation of the \\"automannequins\\". The character's fates can be read in the automatons' performance: the male dummy performs with panache and exits the stage; the female dummy's crash foreshadows Martha's demise; the third dummy is incomplete and unable to perform its intended mission. Additionally, the actual automaton Franz represents a backward critique by Nabokov of the Weimar German psyche—ripe for destructive organization. The picture of Franz is that of a lower-class German who is easily manipulated, surrenders his moral judgment, and becomes increasingly dehumanized. In the book's last scenes, Nabokov describes Franz (with great penetration and comedy) as having \\"reached a stage at which human speech, unless representing a command, was meaningless.\\"Vladimir Nabokov, King, Queen, Knave, New York: McGraw Hill, 1968. p. 247. When Nabokov wrote the story, Nazism was then in its nascent stages, and Franz appears as a \\"Nazi in the making\\".Leona Toker. Nabokov. The Mystery of Literary Structure. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York, 1989. Page 63. Franz is faced in the train to Berlin by a man with a grotesque facial disfiguration, a glimpse of his fate according to the narrator. The narrator tells us also that Franz will eventually be “guilty of worse sins than avunculicide\\", a section that was inserted by Nabokov much later with historical hindsight when he prepared the English translation. Authorial walk-ons The author and his wife, though not directly identified, are portrayed near the end of the novel as a happy, but \\"puzzling\\" couple who are also vacationing in the Baltic resort and speaking in a foreign tongue;Nabokov, King, Queen, Knave, pps, 232, 254. Nabokov describes himself and Vera in a breezy prose postcard: \\"The girl had a delicately painted mouth and tender gray-blue eyes, and her fiancé or husband, slender, elegantly balding, contemptuous of everything on earth but her, was looking at her with pride; and Franz felt envious of that unusual pair.\\" they have a butterfly net, which is taken for a mosquito net by Franz and a shrimp net by Martha, but Dreyer identifies it correctly. Later Franz sees them again and feels they are talking about him and know \\"everything about his predicament\\". Dreyer reads a list of people in their hotel. The strange name Blavdak Vinomori strikes him; presumably this is the name of the male of this couple; it is an anagram of Vladimir Nabokov. The name Mr. Vivian Badlook also appears in the text, a \\"fellow skier and teacher of English,\\" who photographs Dreyer in Davos, another anagram of Vladimir Nabokov. In the book, there is also a reference to a fictional movie King, Queen, Knave, based on a play by a \\"Goldemar\\".

Life Vidyarthi obtained his master's degree from Lucknow University in anthropology, studying under D. N. Majumdar. He received PhD from Chicago University in 1958 under the supervision of Robert Redfield and McKim Marriott. His doctoral dissertation was The sacred complex of a traditional city of Northern India. He started his career as a professor at Ranchi College (under Bihar University), and served there from 1953 to 1956. He worked as a professor of anthropology at Ranchi University from 1958 to 1968, and became head of the department of anthropology in 1968. He served at this position till his death in 1985. He died on 1 December 1985.  Works  Vidyarthi believed that social scientists in India must explore the scriptures, such as the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Smritis, the Puranas and the Great Epics, if they are to acquire a sensitive insight into the social realities of India. He advocated for appreciation of traditional religion not to be swayed by those western scholars who proclaim only the negative influence of religion on development. Vidyarthi declared that the social scientists must not ignore the Indian social thinkers like Sri Aurobindo, Rabindra Nath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda, Raja Ram Mohan Roy etc. who spoke in terms of \\"spiritual humanism, universal love and non-violence\\". He said of the tribal people: > It is for the Indian Anthropologists to take them seriously and not to be > carried away by the voluminous writings of the Western Scholars who termed > them to be 'animist', 'savages' and 'very different form the Hindus'. In 1951, Vidyarthi learned of the Maler tribe, which according to him was one of the few primitive tribes of great anthropological interest in India. When he got to know about the excessive primitiveness of the isolated Malers, he decided to make them the object of his scientific investigation. Vidyarthi explained how the ecological basis of forests and the slash-and-burn cultivation shaped the socio-economic life of the Maler tribe. He studied man in relation with man. Lastly, he presented the four types of Maler spirits, (Gossaiyan — the benevolent spirits, Jiwe Urrkya — the ancestors, Alchi — evil spirits and Chergani — spiritual power of a witch or witchcraft) in a framework of sacred geography, sacred performances, and sacred specialists. Nature, Man and spirit interact of necessity. This was the basis of the famous concept of Nature-Man-Spirit Complex proposed by Vidyarthi. The another major concept that Vidyarthi brought into the Anthropological arena was that of a Sacred complex. His work The Sacred Complex in Hindu Gaya is considered to be one of the greatest contributions to the field of Anthropology. Gaya is a sacred city of Hindu pilgrimage. He described Gaya in terms of \\"a sacred geography\\", a set of \\"sacred performances\\" and a group of \\"sacred specialists\\". These three concepts are the ones comprising the \\"Sacred Complex\\", which is essentially a 'great tradition' in character. This great tradition is the one which reflects Hinduism and unites the diverse people of India. Vidyarthi's study of Hindu Gaya demonstrated that the sacred complex establishes and maintains continuity and compromise between the traditions of the Hindu Civilisation.

Career After a short stint in the United States Marine Corps during his late teens, Carr launched his acting career with a role in a New Orleans production of Herman Melville's Billy Budd. By the middle 1950s, he was working on live television in New York City, including appearances on the popular Studio One and Kraft Television Theater, while continuing theatrical work in stock companies in Ohio and Michigan, including roles such as Peter Quilpe in The Cocktail Party, Haemon in Antigone, Jack in Tennessee Williams' The Rose Tattoo, and Hal Carter in William Inge's Picnic. He toured in summer stock with Chico Marx in Fifth Season. Carr made his film debut in 1955 with a small uncredited role in Alfred Hitchcock's thriller The Wrong Man. That same year, he portrayed a prisoner of war in the New York Theatre Guild production of Time Limit on Broadway. His film career continued with a much larger role in Alfred Werker's The Young Don't Cry in 1957 starring James Whitmore and Sal Mineo; and that same year he appeared in the Warner Bros. rock and roll jukebox movie Jamboree as Pete Porter. He worked steadily on television in the late 1950s and early 1960s with guest spots and supporting roles in many western series such as three appearances on Laramie, Trackdown, four appearances on Rawhide, The Rifleman, The Tall Man, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, and The Virginian. He also appeared in many dramas. One such appearance was in 1964 when he played folk singer and defendant Con Bolton in the Perry Mason episode \\"The Case of the Tandem Target\\". He also appeared on 77 Sunset Strip, Straightaway, The Everglades, Dr. Kildare, Going My Way, Hawaii Five-O, The Fugitive, Twelve O'Clock High, and The Silent Force, interspersed with occasional film work, including Captain Newman, M.D.. Other television appearances were on Burke's Law, Combat!, Gunsmoke, The Time Tunnel, Land of the Giants, Star Trek, and The Invaders. In 1965, Carr acted in the role of Bill Horton, the physician son of protagonist Dr. Tom Horton on Days of Our Lives in its first season. He was later a regular on General Hospital and The Doctors. Carr went on to work in many of other television shows in the intervening years, including Get Smart, Mannix, The Rockford Files, Police Story and Murphy Brown. He may be remembered best, however, for his various appearances on science fiction shows over the years. In 1964/1965, he had the recurring role of uptight crewman Casey Clark on Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. In 1965, Carr played Lt. Lee Kelso, the USS Enterprise helmsman in the second Star Trek pilot episode, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\". The episode finally aired, out of sequence in terms of new episodes produced, early in the first season of Star Trek in the autumn of 1966. Carr would later use the name Lee Kelso as a pseudonym for his voice performances in the English-language versions of the anime shows Cowboy Bebop and Trigun. In 1981, he joined the cast of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century as 'Lt. Devlin', one of the officers on the Earth Starship Searcher. Throughout his career, Carr's first love was the stage. He appeared in nearly 100 stage productions on Broadway, off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway, as well as touring companies, stock, and in regional theaters around the United States. He received the LA Weekly Theater Award for Best Actor in the Theatre East production of Manhattan Express in 1987 and garnered a 1995 Dramalogue Award for his role in the Los Angeles Repertory production of Assassins. Carr was also a writer and director, and headed the Play Committee of the L.A. Repertory Company. Death Carr died of lung cancer in Los Angeles, California on February 17, 2006. He was 72 years old.

Attic white-ground lekythos (type I) depicting Herakles fighting Geryon, Museo archeologico regionale Antonio Salinas, Palermo Spinning woman, Attic oinochoe (type III), probably from Locri, by the Brygos Painter, circa 490 BC White-ground technique is a style of white ancient Greek pottery and the painting in which figures appear on a white background. It developed in the region of Attica, dated to about 500 BC. It was especially associated with vases made for ritual and funerary use, if only because the painted surface was more fragile than in the other main techniques of black- figure and red-figure vase painting. Nevertheless, a wide range of subjects are depicted. Technique and style In white-ground pottery, the vase is covered with a light or white slip of kaolinite. A similar slip had been used as carrier for vase paintings in the Geometric and Archaic periods. White- ground vases were produced, for example, in Ionia, Laconia and on the Cycladic islands. But only in Athens did it develop into a veritable separate style beside black-figure and red-figure vase painting. For that reason, the term white-ground pottery or white-ground vase painting is usually used in reference to the Attic material only. The light slip was probably meant to make the vases appear more valuable, perhaps by eliciting associations with ivory or marble. However, in no case was a vessel's entire surface covered in white slip. It has also been conjecturedSee Tiverios and Tsiafakis, Color in Ancient Greece, 2002, for a survey of opinions on this. that this form of painting emerged in order to emulate the more prestigious medium of wall painting, but the thesis has been elusive of proof. Furthermore, the group of five Huge Lekythoi (c. 70–100 cm high) are covered entirely in white slip, which suggests an imitation of marble lekythoi for funerary purposes.Kurtz, Athenian White Lekythoi: Patterns and Painters, Oxford 1975, p.69-70; Schreiber, Athenian Vase Construction: A Potter's Analysis, Malibu 1999, p.183. White-ground vase painting often occurred in association with red- figure vase painting. Especially typical of this are kylikes with a white- ground interior and a red-figure exterior image. White-ground painting is less durable than black- or red-figure, which is why such vases were primarily used as votives and grave vessels. Types Hera on the tondo of an Attic white- ground kylix (type IV) found at Vulci, by the Sabouroff Painter (ca. 470 BC) The development of white-ground vase painting took place parallel to that of the black- and red-figure styles. In the course of that development, five sub- styles can be noted: Raging maenad by the Brygos Painter. She holds a thyrsos in her right hand, her left is swinging a panther through the air. A snake is winding through the diadem in her hair. Tondo of a kylix, 490-480 BCE. Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen. Early use. The earliest surviving example of the technique is a fragmentary kantharos signed by the potter-painter Nearchos ca. 570 BC . It was found on the Athenian Acropolis (Akropolis 611).Cohen, Colors of Clay, 2006, p.187 The technique was used to create strobing bands of colour that emphasize the shape of the vase.Metropolitan Museum of Art 1926,26.49. and is associated with the workshops of Andokides, Nikosthenes and Psiax.Cohen, op. cit., p.188 Type I. The use of a white ground in conjunction with outline painting did not develop until some fifty years later, when black-figure vase painting on white ground was probably introduced by the potter Nikosthenes around 530/525 BC. After a short interval, this technique was also adopted by other workshops, including that of Psiax.Cohen, op. cit., p.188 The manner of painting is the same as in conventional black-figure, the colour of the grounding being the only difference. The ground is rarely pure white, but usually slightly yellowish or light beige. Type II. A second form is monochrome silhouette drawing. Images are not created from reservation (paint-free areas) and painted internal detail (as in red-figure vase painting), but from drawn outlines and painted internal detail. This style is used since the end of the 6th century BC, especially on cups, alabastra and lekythoi. Initially, the outline of the figures is executed in the form of a relief line, but from about 500 BC, this is increasingly replaced by painted yellowish-brown lines. The so-called semi-outline technique is a combination of the first and the second technique, used only in the first half of the 5th century BC, virtually exclusively on lekythoi and alabastra. Type III. In the first quarter of the 5th century, the workshop of the potter Euphronios develops a four-colour painting style using a combination of shiny clay slip and mineral paints. The images are made up of outline drawings in shiny slip and coloured areas in mineral paint. This style is used especially on pyxides and cups. Some details, such as fruit, jewellery, weaponry or vessels can be executed in clay slip in such a fashion as to attain a slight plasticity, additionally they may be gilded. The paints used are limited to tones of red and brown, yellow, white and black. Type IV. Early Classical lekythos painting combined shiny slip, mineral paints and non.ceramic mineral paints, This type developed in the second quarter of the 5th century BC. It was used in painting large grave lekythoi used in funerary cult. The images are mostly constructed of coloured areas. Pure outline drawing is only used for the depiction of male bodies at this stage. Female bodies are rendered in white paint, clothing in black shiny slip, mineral paints and occasionally non-ceramic paints such as cinnabarite or Egyptian blue. Many images depict scenes from women's life (the gynaikion). Grave images are rare. The most important representative of this style is the Achilles Painter. Type V. The fifth style was polychrome lekythos painting. It replaced Early Classical lekythos painting around the middle of the 5th century BC. By this time, white-ground can be identified most closely with three principal shapes: the lekythos, the krater, and cups.Cohen, op. cit., p.190 Black shiny slip and white paint now disappeared from the paintings. Female bodies were again rendered as simple outline drawings. Non- ceramic mineral paints also ceased to be used. At the same time, several painters, starting with the Sabouroff Painter, began to use red or blackish- grey matt paints, instead of shiny slip, for the contours. Only the contours are painted before firing, other paints are applied afterwards. Therefore, the durability of such vase paintings is very limited; many examples are badly preserved or completely worn. As a result, it is difficult to assess the depicted motifs. Grave scenes are predominant.

By the end of the century, some first attempts at shaded painting can be observed, influenced probably by contemporaneous panel painting. Notable in this regard is the Group of the Huge Lekythoi, specialised in decorating large grave vessels. During the second half of the 5th century, white-ground vase painting was used nearly exclusively for grave lekythoi. When that vase type went out of use around 400 BC, white-ground vase painting also ceased. Later, during the Hellenistic period, various types of white-ground pottery occur in several locations of the Greek World, sometimes painted monochrome, sometimes polychrome. They include Hâdra vases, Canosa Vases and vases of the Centuripe type. Lagynoi were often decorated in white- ground technique. Notes  Bibliography  * Donna Kurtz: Athenian White Lekythoi.

It can be identified as him from the striated eyebrows, full lips, sombre expression and the head's twist down and to the right (reminiscent of that of the Lemnian Athena), whilst its smooth skin and elaborate, centre-parted hair mirror those of Hellenistic images of Dionysus and Apollo. It formed part of a colossal acrolithic cult statue for the worship of Antinous as a god. 31 holes in 3 different sizes have been drilled for the attachment of a head-dress (possibly a lotus flower or uraeus) in metal; the sculpture has also lost eyes in metal, ivory or coloured stone. It is said to have been found at Frascati between 1713 and 1729 - it was certainly displayed as part of the Borghese collection at their Villa Mondragone there. Winckelmann made it better known by praising it in his History of Ancient Art, calling it \\"the glory and crown of art in this age as well as in others\\" and \\"so immaculate that it appears to have come fresh out of the hands of the artist\\".In the posthumous publication of Winckelmann's history translated into Italian with copious notes by Carlo Fea, Storia delle arti del disegno presso gli antichi Rome, 1783-84, it was described in vol. II, p 386, noted by Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900 (Yale University Press) 1981, p. 101. This was since, though Roman in date, it echoed the 5th century BC Greek style which Winckelmann preferred over Roman art.In contrast to Winckelmann's enthusiasm for it, John Addington Symonds criticised the head in 1879 for its \\"vacancy and lifelessness\\". In 1807 it was bought with a large part of the Borghese collections for Napoleon. Sometime after this, a brown layer of wax was added to give an opaque finish, along with plaster round the base of the neck to make the statue look more complete - these were both removed in recent cleaning.

The 2013 New Zealand census gave its population as 303, a decline of 54 people since the 2006 census. History Origins of name The literal meaning of Ohai is unclear, but a mural in the town centre reads \\"OHAI\\" and then curved underneath \\"Place of the Stone\\". The name Ohai was recorded by James Herries Beattie as in use for the area before 1840. Up until as late as 1958 Morley stream near the town was officially called Ohai Stream in the Wairio District Survey maps. It is likely that the area was originally named in relation to an historic Maori stone quarry that is nearby as described in New Zealand Archaeological Association Schedule & Maps of Recorded Archaeological Sites, Map 7, Page 271 Early history Ohai township was founded in 1917 following the discovery of large amounts of high quality coal in the area. However, the early days of mining were restricted by poor roads. Coal production boomed in the area in 1925, when the Ohai Railway Board opened a new line linking Wairio to the Ohai Railway District. This line also carried workers between Wairio and Ohai on a passenger steam train called the ‘Piecart’. In order to provide convenient transport of the coal to markets beyond the local area, a privately owned railway extension from the New Zealand Railways Department's Wairio Branch was opened by the Ohai Railway Board in January 1925. In 1934, this line was further extended beyond Ohai to Birchwood, but the terminus had reverted to Ohai by the time the line was incorporated into the national rail network in 1990. The line is now called the Ohai Line and is one of the very few survivors of a formerly extensive rural branch line network. The Ohai Railway Board Heritage Trust, which had no connection with the Ohai Railway Board, was involved in the restoration of steam locomotives including members of the P and V classes and a railway museum was established, but the trust has been dissolved. Modern history Mechanization of mining methods in the 1980s brought huge changes to Ohai (and the nearby sister town of Nightcaps). Many families with generations associated in mining left the area. In Ohai today, shearing now rivals mining as the biggest industry employer in the town. Recent times have seen a number of people move into the Ohai/Nightcaps area (many of them North Islanders), attracted by the rural lifestyle and affordable housing. Ohai's rural location lends itself well to many outdoor pursuits. These include fishing and duck hunting, the close proximity of rivers and duck ponds making these popular local pursuits. Infrastructure Ohai is the terminus of , which runs from Mataura via Hedgehope and Winton. The primary school closed in 2003 and students now attend school in nearby Nightcaps. A heated and covered swimming pool, tennis courts, golf course, a bowls club, a police station, and a recreational reserve are located in the town. The Takitimu District Pool is a large (33 metre) heated, covered pool in Ohai. It is open for use during daylight hours from around late October through to March. Sliding doors allow the pool area to be opened out to an outdoor garden. Public sessions are available at certain times most afternoons during the season. Once a week during these sessions the 'inflatable' is used in the pool. Alternatively, family or single keys can be purchased seasonally, providing users with unlimited use during daylight hours. Local coal, supplied by Solid Energy, heats the swimming pool. Many volunteers donate their time to help maintain and manage this facility. Despite concerns about the closure of the mine, many residents look forward to the establishment of recreational lakes that will be connected to the local trout stream, and the construction of walkways around the Morley streams and proposed lakes. An example of the coal mine rehabilitation with the similar community use concept can be found at Glyncorrwg, South Wales, United Kingdom. Major petroleum company L&M; Energy is successfully completing the final stages of its well-drilling programme for coal seam gas production on the outskirts of the town. If the Ohai coal seam gas project is able to convert its existing 3P gas reserves into 2P reserves for development, it could be the biggest onshore gas project in New Zealand, creating growth and opportunities in this town. Coal is to be mined again on a small scale, commencing mid-2012. Threat of mine subsidence Map showing extent of underground mining in Ohai area. During 2012 there was some concern from some residents of a possible mine subsidence risk in Ohai, due to several old mining tunnels under the Northern part of the township dating from pre- World War II, the old Wairaki 3 mine works. In July, a man had called the council claiming his drainage system was affected by subsidence, but an engineer had concluded it was not the case. Solid Energy had told the council the risk of subsidence from the old Wairaki 3 mine works, which lie under the northern side of the township, was \\"very minimal\\", he said, since subsidence normally occurred in the first few years, but they would continue working together to examine it. After an unrelated survey of 2 km of pipes was completed, Council Chief executive Dave Adamson said overall, the survey work did not highlight any areas that may cause significant immediate concern. \\"Now that we have some good information on the condition of the pipes it will allow us to plan better for the long term. It needs to be made clear the purpose of the survey was to determine the condition and remaining life of the pipes, it was not to prove or disprove the existence of a subsidence issue or problem.\\" \\"However, any subsidence would have been obvious during the camera survey\\", Mr Adamson said. Ohai CDA chairman John Hogg said he had not heard of houses or gardens subsiding in the township. Council chief executive Dave Adamson said he had asked staff to look at the problem, but many old mining towns in New Zealand had tunnels underneath them. \\"As far as I know we haven't had any direct reports of subsidence issues to date,\\" he said. However, going public with the potential subsidence issue was not welcomed by some in Ohai. One of the CDA members who resigned, said he was unhappy another CDA member had gone to the Southland Times,(Regional Newspaper).

Amaldi graduated under the supervision of Enrico Fermi and was his main collaborator until 1938, when Fermi left Italy for the United States. In 1939, Amaldi was drafted into the Royal Italian Army and returned to physics in 1941. The Via Panisperna Boys, including Edoardo Amaldi (center), circa 1934 After WWII, Amaldi held the chair of \\"General Physics\\" at the Sapienza University of Rome, rebuilt the post-Fermi school of physics, and was the co-founder of the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics and of ESRO. He was the general secretary of CERN at its early stages when operations were still provisional, before September's 1954 official foundation. He pioneered in Europe the search for gravitational waves. His main scientific results were on slow neutrons in the Fermi group, and the evidence for antiproton annihilations with emulsion techniques, somewhat contemporary to its production in accelerators by Emilio Segrè and collaborators. Amaldi co-authored about 200 scientific publications ranging from atomic spectroscopy and nuclear physics to elementary particle physics and experimental gravitation, as well as textbooks for secondary schools and universities.

His style has been enormously influential and has been described as the foundation of American Primitive Guitar, a term borrowed from painting and referring mainly to the self-taught nature of the music and its minimalist style. Fahey borrowed from the folk and blues traditions in American roots music, having compiled many forgotten early recordings in these genres. He would later incorporate 20th-century classical, Portuguese, Brazilian, and Indian influences into his work. Fahey spent many of his later years in poverty and poor health, but enjoyed a minor career resurgence in the late 1990s, with a turn towards the avant-garde. He also created a series of abstract paintings in his final years. Fahey died in 2001 from complications from heart surgery. In 2003, he was ranked 35th on Rolling Stone magazine's \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" list. Life and career Early years: 1939–1959 Fahey and his mother, Takoma Park, Maryland, 1945 Fahey was born into a musical household in Washington, D.C. in 1939.Lowenthal, S.; Dance of Death\\" the Life of John Fahey, American Guitarist; Chicago Review Press; Chicago: 2014. p. 3 Both his father, Aloysius John Fahey, and his mother, Jane (née Cooper), played the piano. In 1945, the family moved to the Washington suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland, where his father lived until his death in 1994. On weekends, the family attended performances of the top country and bluegrass acts of the day, but it was hearing Bill Monroe's version of Jimmie Rodgers' \\"Blue Yodel No. 7\\" on the radio that ignited the young Fahey's passion for music. In 1952, after being impressed by guitarist Frank Hovington, whom he met while on a fishing trip, he purchased his first guitar for $17 from a Sears, Roebuck Catalog. Along with his budding interest in the guitar, Fahey was attracted to record-collecting. While his tastes ran mainly in the bluegrass and country vein, Fahey discovered his love of early blues upon hearing Blind Willie Johnson's \\"Praise God I'm Satisfied\\" on a record-collecting trip to Baltimore with his friend and mentor, the musicologist Richard K. Spottswood. Much later, Fahey compared the experience to a religious conversion; he remained a devout disciple of the blues for the rest of his life. As his guitar-playing and composing progressed, Fahey developed a style that blended the picking patterns he discovered on old blues 78s with the dissonance of 20th-century classical composers he loved, such as Charles Ives and Béla Bartók. In 1958, Fahey made his first recordings. These were for his friend Joe Bussard's amateur Fonotone label and were recorded under both the pseudonym \\"Blind Thomas\\" and under his own name. These recordings, individually pressed in very small runs, were reissued in 2011 as a box set under the title Your Past Comes Back To Haunt You: The Fonotone Years 1958–1965. In 1959, Fahey recorded at St. Michaels and All Angels Church in Adelphi, Maryland, and that material would become the first Takoma record. Having no idea how to approach professional record companies and being convinced they would be uninterested, Fahey decided to issue his first album himself, using some cash saved from his gas station attendant job at Martin's Esso and some borrowed from Donald W. Seaton, an Episcopal priest at St. Michaels and All Angels. Thus was born Takoma Records, named in honor of his hometown. One hundred copies of this first album were pressed.According to The Rolling Stone Record Guide (first edition, 1979), \\"there were only ninety-five copies of the record available for distribution.\\" The Guide assigns the record 5 stars out of 5. On one side of the sleeve was the name \\"John Fahey\\"; on the other, \\"Blind Joe Death\\"—a humorous nickname given to him by his fellow blues fans. He attempted to sell these albums himself. Some he gave away, some he sneaked into thrift stores and blues sections of local record shops, and some he sent to folk music scholars, a few of whom were fooled into thinking that there really was a living old blues singer called Blind Joe Death. It took three years for Fahey to sell the remainder of the records. After graduating from American University with a degree in philosophy and religion, Fahey moved to California in 1963 to study philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. Arriving on campus, Fahey, ever the outsider, began to feel dissatisfied with the program's curriculum. He later suggested that studying philosophy had been a mistake and that what he had wanted to understand was really psychology. He was equally unimpressed with Berkeley's post-Beat Generation, proto-hippie music scene, loathing in particular the Pete Seeger–inspired folk-music revivalists he found himself classed with. Eventually, Fahey moved south to Los Angeles to join UCLA's folklore master's program at the invitation of department head D. K. Wilgus, and received an M.A. in folklore in 1966. Fahey's master's thesis on the music of Charley Patton was later published by Studio Vista in 1970. He completed it with the musicological assistance of his friend Alan Wilson, who would go on to be in the band Canned Heat. 1960s and early 1970s Fahey in studio with Recording King guitar, 1970 While Fahey lived in Berkeley, Takoma Records was reborn through a collaboration with Maryland friend ED Denson. Fahey decided to track down blues legend Bukka White by sending a postcard to Aberdeen, Mississippi; White had sung that Aberdeen was his hometown, and Mississippi John Hurt had been rediscovered using a similar method. When White responded, Fahey and ED Denson decided to travel to Memphis and record White. These recordings became the first non-Fahey Takoma release. Fahey released a second album on the label in late 1963, Death Chants, Breakdowns and Military Waltzes. To the duo's surprise, the Fahey release sold better than White's, and Fahey had the beginnings of a career. His releases during the mid-1960s employed odd guitar tunings and sudden shifts in style firmly rooted in the old-time and blues stylings of the 1920s. But he was not simply a copyist, as compositions such as \\"When the Catfish Is in Bloom\\" or \\"Stomping Tonight on the Pennsylvania/Alabama Border\\" demonstrate. Fahey described the latter piece as follows: > The opening chords are from the last movement of Vaughan Williams' Sixth > Symphony. It goes from there to a Skip James motif. Following that it moves > to a Gregorian chant, \\"Dies Irae\\". It's the most scary one in the Episcopal > hymn books, it's all about the day of judgment. Then it returns to the > Vaughan Williams chords, followed by a blues run of undetermined origin, > then back to Skip James and so forth. A hallmark of his classic releases was the inclusion of lengthy liner notes, parodying those found on blues releases. In the later half of the 1960s, Fahey continued to issue material through Takoma as well as Vanguard Records, which had signed him along with similar instrumental folk guitarists Sandy Bull and Peter Walker. Albums from this period, such as Days Have Gone By, The Voice of the Turtle, Requia, and The Yellow Princess, found Fahey making sound collages from such elements as gamelan music, Tibetan chanting, animal and bird cries and singing bridges. In 1967, Fahey recorded with Texas psych-rock trio The Red Crayola at the 1967 Berkeley Folk Festival, music that resurfaced on the 1998 Drag City release The Red Krayola: Live 1967. The Red Crayola subsequently recorded an entire studio album with Fahey, but the Red Crayola's label demanded possession of the tapes and recorded documentation of those sessions has been missing ever since. He married his first wife Jan in 1969, traveling back to Maryland for his nuptials. During the spring of 1969, Fahey performed several East Coast shows, including several nights at the world renowned Cellar Door in Georgetown. In the summer, he toured the South and appeared at the Memphis Country Blues Festival on June 6 and 7th. In addition to his own creative output, Fahey expanded the Takoma label, discovering fellow guitarists Leo Kottke, Robbie Basho, Bola Sete and Peter Lang, as well as an emerging pianist in George Winston. Kottke's debut release on the label, 6- and 12-String Guitar, ultimately proved to be the most successful of the crop, selling more than 500,000 copies. Other artists with albums on the label included Mike Bloomfield, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Maria Muldaur, Michael Gulezian, and Canned Heat. In 1979, Fahey sold Takoma to Chrysalis Records. Jon Monday, who had been the general manager of the label since 1970, was the only employee to go with the new company. Chrysalis eventually sold the rights to the albums, and Takoma was in limbo until bought by Fantasy Records in 1995. Later years By the mid-1970s, Fahey's output had abated and he had begun to suffer from a drinking problem. He lost his home in the dissolution of his first marriage, remarried, divorced again, and moved to Salem, Oregon, in 1981 to live with his third wife, Melody. He soon met Portland guitarist Terry Robb who would serve as his producer, arranger and accompanist on several albums for Varrick, a subsidiary of Rounder Records.Lowenthal, Steve. Dance of Death: The Life of John Fahey, American Guitarist, Chicago Review Press, 2014. In 1986, Fahey contracted Epstein-Barr syndrome, a long-lasting viral infection, which exacerbated his diabetes and other health problems. He continued to perform in and around the Salem area, and was managed by friends David Finke and his wife Pam. The trio attempted to keep Fahey's career afloat through radio appearances and performances at small venues. Fahey broke up with his third wife, and his life began to spiral downward. He made what appeared to be his last album in 1990. Although he had recovered from Epstein- Barr syndrome after five years, he would spend much of the early 1990s living in poverty, mostly in cheap motels. Gigs had dried up because of his health problems. He paid his rent by pawning guitars and reselling rare records he found in thrift stores. Following a 1994 entry on Fahey in Spin magazine's spin-off Alternative Record Guide, Fahey learned that he now had a whole new audience, which included the alternative bands Sonic Youth and Cul de Sac and the avant-garde musician Jim O'Rourke. A lengthy article in Spin magazine by Byron Coley, \\"The Persecutions and Resurrections of Blind Joe Death\\", combined with a two-disc retrospective, The Return of the Repressed, to revive Fahey's career. New releases started to appear rapidly, alongside reissues, by Fantasy Records, of all the early Takoma releases. O'Rourke went on to produce a Fahey album, Womblife, in 1997. That same year, Fahey recorded an album with Cul de Sac, The Epiphany of Glenn Jones, named for the band's lead guitarist. Gone were the melodic dreaminess and folk-based meditations of the 1960s and 70s, which Fahey had later described as \\"cosmic sentimentalism\\". With characteristic wit, he once said of his style, \\"How can I be a folk? I'm from the suburbs you know.\\" Fahey's passion for traditional folklore did not subside. After the death of his father in 1995, Fahey used his inheritance to form another label, Revenant Records, to focus on reissuing obscure recordings of early blues, old-time music, and anything else that took his fancy. In 1997, Revenant issued its first crop of releases, including albums by the British guitarist Derek Bailey, the American pianist Cecil Taylor, Jim O'Rourke, bluegrass pioneers The Stanley Brothers, old-time banjo legend Dock Boggs, Rick Bishop of Sun City Girls, and the slide guitarist Jenks \\"Tex\\" Carman. The label's most famous release would prove to be Screamin' and Hollerin' the Blues: The Worlds of Charley Patton, a seven-disc retrospective of Charley Patton and his contemporaries. It won three Grammy awards in 2003. Fahey, for his part, won a Grammy in 1997 for his contributions to the liner notes of Revenant's Anthology of American Folk Music, Vol. 4. In February 2001, six days before his 62nd birthday, Fahey died at Salem Hospital after undergoing a sextuple coronary bypass. In 2006, no fewer than four Fahey tribute albums were released as a testament to his reputation as a \\"giant of 20th century American music\\". Paintings During the later years of his life, Fahey painted a series of abstract paintings. Many of these were exhibited from July 10 to September 12, 2010, at The East Village, New York, presented by John Andrew and Audio Visual Arts (AVA). The exhibit featured 55 paintings, ranging in size from 6.75\\" by 9\\" to 22\\" by 29\\". The \\"sale sheet\\" for the exhibit listed prices from $750 for smaller works to $3,000 for the large paintings. The paintings were either framed or unframed. AVA described Fahey's paintings as follows: > Pulling inspiration from the 'French Primitive', untutored painters, Fahey > often referred to his music as 'American Primitive'. The same alluring, raw, > roots, mysterious, power, grit, obscure, industrial, ambient, epic, and > tranquilizing aesthetics that one finds in Faheys music and his writings are > equally present in his paintings. The 90s proved to be a decade of > regeneration for Fahey. Though he struggled with certain health problems, he > was brimming with experimentation. Collaborating with noise artists and > improvisational performers of the alternative movement, Fahey began to > channel a new outlet for experimentation which included his return to > painting; a hobby he abandoned when he took up the guitar. Fahey's works are > evocative of action painters and abstract expressionists. He painted on > found poster board and discarded spiral notebook paper. His painting studio > floated from motel bed to motel bed and eventually ended up on the bed of > his rental home in Salem, OR; occasionally painting with anti-freeze in the > garage. He worked with tempera, acrylic, spray paint, and magic marker. Several of Fahey's paintings were sold on eBay by Michael R. Karn in July 2001. Karn attested, > John brought [these paintings] into the used book store I owned and > operated, Balcony Books, located at 108 SW Third Street in Corvallis, > Oregon, in December 1998. John had been shopping and trading with me for > several years. I originally became acquainted with him several years earlier > when I operated a similar store in Salem, Oregon, where John lived at the > time. John often brought in books or records he had scouted, and exchanged > them for books and records from our stock. He also generously signed several > records and posters from my personal collection for me, and even performed a > couple of in-store concerts. Karn said he received several paintings \\"directly from John in exchange for a large collection of Duke Ellington records which I had recently obtained. He had recently taken up painting as a creative outlet. He was aware the paintings could be sold some day, even though he himself would not sell his paintings, but he understood the nature of the used book and record business, and gave his blessing to me to sell them in the store if I wished. I never did sell a painting in store, but recently [sold several] through auction at ebay.\\"Notarized Certificate of Provenance for \\"a large abstract painting by the guitar legend John Fahey, dated 9/98 and signed in bold letters by John Fahey, measures 22\\" × 28\\"\\", by Michael Karn, Balcony Books and Music, P.O.

Documentaries Starting work in 2007, filmmaker Marc Minsker produced a 30-minute documentary on Fahey's life entitled John Fahey: The Legacy of Blind Joe Death. It chronicles Fahey's early life in Takoma Park, and his success as a guitarist and record producer in California. It also follows Fahey through his dark days in Salem, and ends with commentary on his contributions to American music. The film premiered at the Takoma Park Film Festival on Friday, May 7, 2010. The screening was accompanied by a live performance and discussion with Fahey's friend, the guitarist Peter Lang. A feature-length documentary directed by James Cullingham, In Search of Blind Joe Death: The Saga of John Fahey, was released in 2013.

Former political and cultural leaders from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania were members of the organization. Its main office was in New York, with branch offices in Bonn, London and Paris. History The goals of the ACEN were, in their own words: > to provide liberation from communist dictatorship by peaceful means, to > educate public opinion on the actual situation behind the Iron Curtain, and > to enlist the cooperation and assistance of governmental and non- > governmental institutions. Funding was provided by the Free Europe Committee. When that organization suspended financial assistance to ACEN in January 1972 because of its own budget reductions, the offices of ACEN were closed and publication activities came to a halt. During its lifetime the organization published pamphlets and periodicals in English, as well as some of the members' own languages. It also sponsored symposia and exhibitions, in particular it promoted the commemoration of Captive Nations Week. It provided background information to members of the United States Congress regarding the political and economic situations in their homelands situated behind the Iron Curtain. The records of the ACEN and its member organizations are preserved in the Immigration History Research Center Archives, University of Minnesota Libraries.

The song is a ballad, with Sigga expressing her delight in the power of nights. She sings that in her dreams she can be with her lover, even if this is not the case in the real world. The song was performed in the Icelandic national final by Sigga's sister, Sigrun, who had previously sung with her as a member of the group 'Heart2Heart' at the Eurovision Song Contest 1992. However, bosses at Icelandic television felt that the arrangement of the song would not lead them to victory, therefore a new arrangement was created for the Eurovision Song Contest final by Frank McNamara, who conducted on the night. Sigrun was replaced with Sigga. The song was performed fifth on the night, following Cyprus' Evridiki with \\"Ime Anthropos Ki Ego\\" and preceding the United Kingdom's Frances Ruffelle with \\"We Will Be Free (Lonely Symphony)\\".

Reed (born April 1963) is a British businessman. He is Chairman and Chief Executive of the Reed group of companies, which comprises Reed Specialist Recruitment, Reed Learning, Reed in Partnership and Reed Online. He is the son of Sir Alec Reed, who founded the company in 1960. Education Reed attended Scaitcliffe prep school and St Paul's. He graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1984 with a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) and subsequently gained an MBA from the Harvard Business School, where his father briefly joined him to study. At Oxford, Reed was political editor of Samizdat, a magazine for political science students. At Harvard he produced a case study and video about slum improvement works in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Titled In The Shadow of The City, the case study was taught at Harvard and other Universities. Reed was travel editor of Harbus News, the Harvard Business School's student news organisation. Early career Reed's first job was in a cemetery, levelling graves at a burial site in Old Windsor. In an interview with The Independent newspaper Reed said: \\"It was miserable, it was cold, it was horrible and hard – and I didn't last very long at it.\\" After graduating from Oxford in 1984, Reed sought to work for an entrepreneur. He wrote a speculative job application to Gordon and Anita Roddick of the Body Shop plc. The couple subsequently employed him as assistant to then-chairman Gordon. Reed has described his time at the Body Shop as his transition from university to the world of work. He has cited Anita Roddick as an influence, saying: \\"If a bottle of jojoba hand lotion wasn't displayed properly on the shelf, she'd pull you up on it. And I really liked that — that combination of real drive and enthusiasm, and getting the details right.\\" During 1985–1986 Reed worked as a media planner and buyer for Saatchi & Saatchi plc, where he planned and managed advertising campaigns for British Rail, Club 18-30, Eurotunnel and Procter and Gamble. From 1987 to 1988 Reed worked for Afghanaid and Help the Aged, co-ordinating relief and development programmes in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. In Afghanistan he established a village assistance programme for farmers affected by regional conflict. He also co-ordinated fundraising, publicity and sponsorship services for Afghanaid, and reported on the Afghan conflict for The Independent newspaper. To enter Afghanistan from Pakistan's border, Reed travelled disguised as an Afghan with a party of Mujahideen rebels. Following his graduation from Harvard in 1990, Reed began a two-year production course at the BBC, where he worked as an assistant producer on documentaries and factual programmes. These included BBC TV's Business Matters, for which Reed produced Crazy Ways for Crazy Days, a 50-minute documentary about management guru Tom Peters, and The Pros and The Cons, an inside view of prison privatisation at Strangeways. After the Tom Peters documentary grossed £1m, Reed requested funding to make a similar programme – but was turned down, leading him to grow dissatisfied with his employment at the BBC. Reed became a non-executive director of Reed in 1992. In a 2014 radio interview, Reed spoke of the circumstances leading up to joining the family business full-time: \\"Joining the family business wasn't a fait accompli. When my father got to 60 he said 'James, there's not much point having a family business if there isn't any family in it'. I'd been sitting on the fence for some time. Then one day he said: ‘That job that I have been talking to you about? It’s going to be in The Sunday Times Appointments section next week – do you want to apply or not?\\" That got me off the fence! I was fearful of following him. He was a very successful entrepreneur who'd set up this business and he was well loved in the business. I was worried about failing. That fear of failure probably kept me on the fence for longer than it should have done.\\" Reed Group Reed joined the Reed Group full-time in April 1994, as director of operations. He became Chief Executive in February 1997. To symbolise the handover of control of the company, Reed's father presented him with a conductor's baton. The baton now hangs on the wall of Reed's personal office at the company's headquarters in Covent Garden, London. In press interviews, Reed is often asked to respond to the accusation that his appointment to the family business was an act of nepotism, which he consistently concedes. In a 2010 Guardian interview he said \\"There is no other way of describing it\\". Reed's father is quoted as believing that family-run businesses \\"...cut out a lot of company politics\\". Reed succeeded his father to the position of chairman in 2004. Reed has said that he considers his three most significant contributions to the Reed Group to be the development of reed.co.uk, the advent of Reed in Partnership and the globalisation of the company. Under his leadership the company's turnover has grown from £150m to £1.1bn. In June 2018 he relocated Reed Group's corporate HQ from Malta to the UK, citing the firm's predominantly British operations and his personal confidence in Britain's economy post-Brexit. Welfare-to-work (Reed in Partnership) In 1997 the- then Paymaster General Geoffrey Robinson invited Reed to bid for the inaugural contracts issued by the newly elected Blair Government which, as part of its New Deal programme, saw some of the traditional work of Job Centres outsourced to the private sector. As of 2011, Reed in Partnership employed 900 staff. Reed has expanded the business into Poland and Australia. De-listing As chief executive, Reed delisted Reed Executive from the UK Stock Exchange in 2003, buying back the company for 140p per share, at a valuation of £62.6 million, an 18% premium to the previous day's closing price. Shares in Reed Executive rose 15% following the announcement. At the time, some financial commentators suggested that the Reed family were taking advantage of a lull in the firm's share price, in the wake of both a cyclical downturn and the controversy over Reed's decision to spin off Reed Health. Two years later Reed would launch a £38m hostile takeover for Reed Health, following which the company eventually came back under the Reed family's control. Reed stated that the firm was delisted because it no longer had need of outside capital. In his autobiography, Reed's father suggested that the de-listing was due in part to the publication of the Higgs and Cadbury reports into public company governance, both of which called for wide-ranging restrictions upon directors and their appointments. reed.co.uk reed.co.uk was the first recruitment website offered by a recruitment agency in the UK. It launched in 1995 with 40 vacancies. It now advertises over 270,000 vacancies a day. In interview, Reed has made light of the fact that the company's first website was suggested and built by a young IT contractor nicknamed \\"Pancake the Clown\\", after the contractor's sideline business as a children's entertainer. Reed later said: \\"The truth of the matter is, I got Pancake the Clown to build our first prototype.\\" Reed has also spoken of being \\"horrified\\" when a young member of staff suggested that the website should offer vacancies advertised by rival recruitment firms. Reed would go on to approve the experiment; the scheme began in May 2000 and by November of the same year over 2000 rival firms had registered on the site. Reed would go on to credit the idea as being the foundation of the firm's online strategy; the junior staff member was paid a £100,000 bonus for his suggestion. Media commentary Reed regularly comments in the media on employment issues, including the minimum wage, apprenticeships, automation, workplace skills, employee engagement, taxation reform for family businesses and jobs for prisoners and ex-prisoners. He has called for state contracts to be held back from firms that deliberately delay payment to creditors. Citing the collapse of Carillion and the £2bn it owed to its suppliers, Reed has characterised such firms as \\"drunk-drivers\\". He has also encouraged school-leavers to consider joining the workplace instead of attending university, and has called upon Oxbridge universities to increase their intake by doubling their semesters. Reed is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). He was formerly an Associate of the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit and a member of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR)'s business-led Taskforce on Race Equality and Diversity in the Private Sector. In the run-up to the 2010 general election, Reed conducted public video-interviews with the three Parliamentary candidates nominated for the role of Secretary of State (Steve Webb, Yvette Cooper and Theresa May), asking questions sent in by job hunters. For the 2017 general election, Reed's cross-party interviews were conducted with Damien Hinds, Debbie Abrahams and Baroness Kramer. Television appearances Between 2008 and 2018, Reed was depicted in a series of humorous TV adverts featuring the actor and comedian Rufus Jones. Some of these adverts have been directed by the previous year's winners of Reed's annual Short Film Competition. The adverts begin with Jones introducing himself as James Reed. Jones' portrayal of Reed is a knowingly over-acted caricature of a comic book superhero, one who has the superpower to transform job-hunters into their ideal vocation. In one advert Reed makes a cameo appearance as an ice cream seller who is transformed into a nightclub DJ by the character of James Reed as played by Jones. The adverts have received more than 28 million YouTube views. The 2016 TV campaign sees Jones playing Reed as a comic knight. Reed has made appearances in Series 11, 13 and 15 of BBC Television's The Apprentice. Philanthropy Reed is a trustee of several Reed family charitable initiatives, including The Reed Foundation and The Big Give Trust. The Big Give was founded by James's father Sir Alec Reed in 2007 and has helped to raise over £129m for UK-registered charities. During the COVID-19 pandemic Reed re-launched the Keep Britain Working campaign, originally launched after the 2008 financial crisis. Alongside Lord Sugar, Lord Bamford, Luke Johnson, James Timpson and others, Reed called upon CEOs to protect jobs by sacrificing management salaries and company profits; he also warned of a possible \\"...tsunami of job losses\\" after the UK government's furloughing scheme ended. During the campaign Reed declined his salary from the family business. He also donated £100,000 from personal funds to the National Emergencies Trust (NET), which was matched by a £100K donation from the Reed Foundation made via The Big Give, whose campaign for NET raised £1.36m in total. Grenfell Tower appeal Reed's family home in London is within sight of Grenfell Tower. After witnessing the Grenfell Tower fire, Reed set up a Big Give charity appeal that raised £1m within 48 hours of the disaster. The appeal went on to raise £2.6m before being closed in September 2017. Reed donated £100,000 of his own money and The Reed Foundation donated a further £100,000, alongside donations made by members of the public, businesses and local organisations. The proceeds were donated to The K&C; Foundation. Reed has called for some of the appeal proceeds to be spent on an educational centre, for residents of the area to learn coding and other digital skills, as part of a wider project to form a hub of digital companies in North Kensington. Publications Put Your Mindset to Work Coauthored by Reed and Harvard lecturer Paul G. Stoltz, Put Your Mindset to Work was published by Portfolio Penguin in May 2011. The book offers research data underlining the importance of employee mindset, citing that 97% of employers would put mindset ahead of skill set when recruiting. The book goes on to identify three elements of a competitive employment mindset, namely Global, Good and Grit, which the authors summarise as \\"the 3G's\\". Global is said to measure an employee's ability to set their actions and decisions in a global context; Good refers to an employee's interpersonal sensitivity and a desire to do good for others; Grit references an employee's tenacity and intensity in the workplace. Put Your Mindset to Work was awarded the CMI Management Book of the Year Award in the Commuters' Read category. The book entered the USA Today best-seller list in June 2011. A second edition of the work was published in August 2013, with jacket endorsements from Timpson CEO James Timpson, Gordon Roddick and management author Jim Kouzes. Why You: 101 Interview Questions You'll Never Fear Again Reed's second book with Penguin Portfolio features examples of interview questions and strategies for answering them, based on research obtained from Reed's network of hirers, recruiters and interviewees. The book's premise is that all interview questions are variations on 15 distinct themes, referred to as \\"The Fateful Fifteen\\". Reed encourages candidates to relate all interview questions to these 15 themes, while cautioning against preparing canned answers in advance, arguing that this approach gets in the way of genuine and spontaneous conversation. Bookbag.co.uk awarded the title a \\"Highly Recommended\\" in its review section; The Notting Hill Post called the book \\"...essential reading\\"  The 7-Second CV: How to Land the Interview  In January 2019 Reed published his third book, with the Virgin Books imprint at Ebury. The title is a reference typical amount of time a recruiter will spend reading a CV before deciding to shortlist or reject an application. The book is written in two voices, consisting of Reed’s commentary on first-person accounts from front-line recruiters. As with his other works, the book was crowd-sourced using Reed Executive’s network, and builds on Reed’s ideas of a \\"growth mindset”. The overall theme is that jobseeker CVs should give more consideration to the time-pressure faced by the recruiter, where most vacancies are heavily oversubscribed and many CVs appear alike. The book offers advice on presenting a relevant work history and honing a unique selling point. Other topics include automated applicant-tracking systems and the role of social media profiles. The book carries an endorsement by Lord Sugar. The Happy Recruiter In June 2019 Reed published The Happy Recruiter, a short book offering career advice for professional recruiters. Life’s Work: 12 Proven Ways to Fast-Track Your Career Published in January 2020, Life's Work is aimed at general readers seeking to choose, switch or enjoy their chosen career. Reed argues that all successful careers are underpinned by a degree of ambition, positivity, peer support, self- knowledge and self-discipline. The most successful and contented workers encountered by Reed tend to be gregarious and self-reflective - but also “sustainably selfish” in their choices, which protects against career burn-out by establishing clear targets and personal boundaries. Reed emphasises that opting for roles and sectors in high growth is essential for personal progress: individuals swept along by structural change tend to do better than those who remain in low-growth roles and sectors, a phenomenon Reed likens to Poohsticks. In a 2020 interview with Management Today, Reed described Dale Carnegie's How To Win Friends And Influence People as being the business book that \\"...resonated most with me\\". Personal life Reed is married to Nicola. The couple live in London and Wiltshire and have six children. His hobbies are said to include running, riding and driving horses, football and mountaineering. He has participated in two of Reed's annual Alpine Leadership Challenges led by the alpinist Stefan Gatt. Reed has identified his father as the person he most admires in the recruitment industry, and King Alfred the Great as his boyhood hero. Awards In 2019 Reed was voted top recruitment CEO on Glassdoor's Employees' Choice awards, and 20th CEO across all industries. In the same year he was also named to the Europe Staffing 100 list of recruitment professionals, published by Staffing Industry Analysis. In 2020 CEO Today magazine named Reed to its list of notable CEOs.

It was the only below ground station on the line. Trains accessed the station via a half-mile tunnel, bored from the cliff face at Herculaneum Dock to Park Road. It is the last remaining part of the Overhead railway, with the surface entrance still standing. The former platform and track area were in use as a garage called Roscoe Engineering until 2015. History The Liverpool Overhead Railway Southern Extension Tunnel is the entrance to Dingle railway station. The extension to a new southern terminus at Dingle was opened on 21 December 1896 with the first trains leaving from Dingle station at 5am that morning, carrying a large number of dock workers. There were plans for the tunnel to extend further inland with a few more stations when funds were available. On the evening of 23 December 1901 a motor on a train pulling into the station fused, causing large amounts of sparking, which ignited a stack of wooden sleepers by the railside. The resulting fire spread to the train carriages and station and resulted in the deaths of six people; the train's guard and driver, the station foreman, a carriage cleaner, and two passengers. The general manager of the railway stated that the fusing would \\"scarcely have caused £5 worth of damage\\" if not for the wind which was blowing into the tunnel and fanning the flames. The station was closed for more than a year. Closure Along with the rest of the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the station closed permanently on 30 December 1956. At approximately 11:30am on 24 July 2012, part of the tunnel near Dingle railway station collapsed. A number of homes above this section of the tunnel were evacuated. In October 2013 work commenced to repair the tunnel, with residents allowed back into their homes in February 2014.

Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The Big Cedar Baptist Church and Burying Ground on Big Cedar Creek Road, between the road to Reily and the Oxford Pike was an arm or branch of the Little Cedar Grove Baptist Church. Construction The church group had organized several years before building a permanent building. In December 1811 the New Madrid earthquake occurred the church members took it as a sign of judgment for their failure to build a proper church. Rev. Allen Wiley, a circuit rider of the church, said \\"The people ran to and fro, called for prayer meetings, exhorted each other to do good deeds and repent of sins as if Judgment Day was at hand. Then they met in solemn conclave and made a covenant with the almighty that if he would send no more earthquakes, they would build Him a church\\".Amazing Tales from Indiana, By Fred D., Pg 6–7 The congregation then quickly proceeded to build a large brick church.

The company received financial backing from aristocrat and coal magnate Earl Fitzwilliam. The first few cars were made by Peter Brotherhood and were a continuation of the Brotherhood-Crocker cars made in London in which Earl Fitzwilliam had been an investor. Stanley Brotherhood sold the London site in 1905 and moved his Peter Brotherhood business to Peterborough, near Fitzwilliam's second seat at Milton Park. He could not get permission to build a car factory in Peterborough so the Earl suggested a move to Sheffield where Stanley Brotherhood built a new factory in Tinsley a few miles south of Wentworth-Woodhouse, the Fitzwilliam family seat.

Car production recommenced in 1919 with the LA7b but now called the 30 hp. Few were sold and it was replaced by a new design, the 50, in 1920. This had a new engine of 7777 cc with each of its six cylinders cast separately. It appeared at the London Motor Show in 1921 fitted with a two-seat body and again in 1922. It is quite probable that it was the only one made. It is believed that at least three cars survive. The unique 50 hp car produced in 1920 and exhibited at several motor shows was acquired by Earl Fitzwilliam, the financial backer of the business, in 1925 after the liquidation of the Sheffield company.

Tiflis, 1910 Tombstones of Smbat and Elikum III Orbelian, inside the St. Gregory Chapel at Noravank monastery. Through the 12th century, the Orbelians were a major feudal family in Georgia, with their home base the fortress of Orbet'i in southern Georgia. In 1177/8, their leader Ivane led his whole extended clan on the losing side in a power struggle between the deceased king's young heir, Ivane's protégé and son-in-law Demetre, and the king's brother Giorgi. Ivane sent his brother Liparit and nephews Elikum and Ivane to the Persians in Tabriz for help, but this new army came too late, after Ivane had been blinded, his family strangled, and young Demetre blinded and castrated. Liparit died in exile. One son, Ivane, returned to Georgia when the situation cooled down; his descendants, on their dwindled estates, stayed prominent in Georgia and even the USSR. Honored by the Persian atabek, other son Elikum stayed and became an important official, converting to Islam and dying in one of the atabek's wars. He left behind a widow, sister of an Armenian bishop of Syunik, and a young son Liparit. These quickly became, involuntarily, the wife and stepson of a Muslim notable in Nakhchivan. In 1211 a combined Armenian and Georgian army under Zakare and Ivane Mkhargrdzeli wrested control of Syunik from the Ildenizid atabeg state. Remembering the Orbelians—whose dominant role in Georgia the Mkhargrdzelis had since filled—Ivane made a search, located Liparit thanks to the bishop brother-in- law, and established him as feudal lord of Vayots Dzor. Bolstered by marriage alliances with its feudal relations the Khaghbakians or Proshians and others, the Orbelians flourished, building or supporting a network of fine monasteries (most notable of which is Noravank, historically important manuscripts, and inscribed khachkars. Every medieval monastery in Vayots Dzor bears inscriptions recording their patronage. The Mongol arrival imposed the need for fast footwork. In 1251 and 1256, the prudent and multi-lingual Orbelian prince Smbat made arduous pilgrimages to Karakorum, armed with a splendid jewel and divine blessing, and persuaded Möngke Khan, son of Genghis, the Mongol ruler, to make Syunik and its churches a tax-exempt fiefdom under Mangu's (or at least his Christian mother's) direct patronage. The family expanded its influence, helped by an apparently genuine and reciprocated liking and respect for the Mongols, at least until the Mongols converted to Islam. In 1286, the scholar of the family, the historian Stepanos, made the pilgrimage to the Western Armenian kingdom in Cilicia and was made Metropolitan—presiding archbishop—of the newly amplified See of Syunik. The fiefdom was divided in three from 1290-1300, then reunited by Burtel, who ruled a flourishing principality and was ultimately named Mayor/Amir of the Mongol capitals Sultania and Tabriz. This close cooperation with the Mongol rulers had its price. Several Orbelians died on the Khan's campaigns far from home, and one spent 12 years a captive in Egypt before being ransomed. The Orbelians survived the arrival of Timur Lenk and his Turkmen hordes in the 1380s, but in the collapse of Timur's empire into warring factions, Smbat, the last firm Orbelian ruler of Syunik, chose the wrong side and, on the capture of his stronghold of Vorotnaberd (south of Sisian) in 1410, decamped for Georgia where he died. Orbelians managed to retain property in Vayots Dzor throughout the 15th century, though many of them emigrated to their relatives in Georgia.

History In the nineteenth century, Arifwala was only a village named as Chak No. 61/EB. Later, it was called Arifwala because of a Sufi Saint, \\"Arif Baba\\", who stayed in the village. His Mazar can be seen in the graveyard near the Railway Station. In 1908, the Deputy Governor \\"Hurbert\\" founded the new city of Arifwala. The most significant castes residing in the area are Kamboh, Awan,Rehmani, Baloch, Jatt, Syed, Rajpoot Rath, Hotiyana, Chishti, joiya, Mohla, Gujja # r, Arain, Raja, Kharal, Rai, Rana, Sukhera, and Doggars. In 1987, Arifwala was raised to the status of sub-division and in 1995 it was attached to district Pakpattan. Qabula is also a famous place near Arifwala.

They mostly use \\"Khan\\", \\"Mian\\" , \\"Pir\\" as titles.Most of the Jatts and Arain Family migrated to India and have come to Arifwala.  Demography  Most of the population are farmers; about 75% of the population live in villages and only 25% live in the municipal urban area. But the trend is shifting with the increase of industrialization in the premises of Arifwala and people are moving to the urban area. Arifwala Tehsil covers an area of 295,146 acres (5 km2) with a population of about 720,000. The urban area covers 457 acres (1.82 km2) and the agriculture area covers 1274 acres (3.18 km²). Punjabi is the native spoken language but Urdu is also widely used. Economy Agriculture is important to the local economy, particularly the growing of cotton, grain, potato, wheat, maize, and rice exported all over Pakistan and around the world. The grain market of Arifwala is one of the biggest grain markets in Pakistan. But the advanced way of agriculture, which is called Tunnel Farming, is on peak. Now it is the big source of economy in this area. Farmers here grow different kinds of vegetables which are also exported all over Pakistan. Industry Industry of Arifwala city is primarily an Agro-based. The main industries include Beverage & Food processing units, Rice Mills, Cotton Ginning & Pressing, Flour Mills, Fertilizer companies, Vegetable Ghee & Cooking Oil, Poultry Feed, Seed Processing, and leather products. Climate The climate of Arifwala is extreme, reaching 45 °C in summer, and down to 05 °C in winter. The soil of the suburbs is very fertile.

In 1909, Herbert Freundlich gave an expression representing the isothermal variation of adsorption of a quantity of gas adsorbed by unit mass of solid adsorbent with pressure.Freundlich, Herbert. Kapillarchemie, eine Darstellung der Chemie der Kolloide und verwandter Gebiete. Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft, 1909. This equation is known as Freundlich adsorption isotherm or Freundlich adsorption equation. As this relationship is entirely empirical, in the case where adsorption behavior can be properly fit by isotherms with a theoretical basis, it is usually appropriate to use such isotherms instead (see for example the Langmuir and BET adsorption theories). The Freundlich equation is also derived (non- empirically) by attributing the change in the equilibrium constant of the binding process to the heterogeneity of the surface and the variation in the heat of adsorption.. Freundlich adsorption isotherm Freundlich's original data for adsorption of acetic acid (page 392 in Freundlich, Herbert. \\" Über die Adsorption in Lösungen.\\" Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie - Stöchiometrie und Verwandschaftslehre (1907): Volume 57, Issue 4, pages 385-470.) and a fit according to Freundlich's exponential law The Freundlich adsorption isotherm is mathematically expressed as :\\\\frac{x}{m} = Kp^{1/n} It is also written as : \\\\log\\\\frac{x}{m} = \\\\log K + \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\log p or :\\\\frac{x}{m} = K c^{1/n} It is also written as :\\\\log \\\\frac{x}{m} = \\\\log K + \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\log c where :x = mass of adsorbate :m = mass of adsorbent :p = Equilibrium pressure of adsorbate :c = Equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in solution. K and n are constants for a given adsorbate and adsorbent at a particular temperature. At high pressure 1/n = 0, hence extent of adsorption becomes independent of pressure. It is used in cases where the actual identity of the solute is not known, such as adsorption of colored material from sugar, vegetable oil etc. The Freundlich equation is unique; consequently, if the data fit the equation, it is only likely, but not proved, that the surface is heterogeneous. The heterogeneity of the surface can be confirmed with calorimetery. Homogeneous surfaces (or heterogeneous surfaces that exhibit homogeneous adsorption (single site)) have a constant \\\\Delta H of adsorption. On the other hand, heterogenous adsorption (multi-site) have a variable \\\\Delta H of adsorption depending on the percent of sites occupied. When the adsorbate pressure (or concentration) are low, high energy sites will be occupied; and as the pressure (or concentration) increases, the lesser energy sites will be occupied resulting in a lower \\\\Delta H of adsorption. Limitation of Freundlich adsorption isotherm Experimentally it was determined that extent of gas adsorption varies directly with pressure, and then it directly varies with pressure raised to the power 1/n until saturation pressure Ps is reached. Beyond that point, the rate of adsorption saturates even after applying higher pressure. Thus, the Freundlich adsorption isotherm fails at higher pressure.

Plug valves are valves with cylindrical or conically tapered \\"plugs\\" which can be rotated inside the valve body to control flow through the valve. The plugs in plug valves have one or more hollow passageways going sideways through the plug, so that fluid can flow through the plug when the valve is open. Plug valves are simple and often economical. When the plug is conically tapered, the stem/handle is typically attached to the larger diameter end of the plug. Plug valves usually do not have bonnets but often have the end of the plug with the handle exposed or mostly exposed to the outside. In such cases, there is usually not much of a stem. The stem and handle often come in one piece, often a simple, approximately L-shaped handle attached to the end of the plug. The other end of the plug is often exposed to the outside of the valve too, but with a mechanism that retains the plug in the body. Handwheel operated plug valve. The simplest and most common general type of plug valve is a 2-port valve with two positions: open to allow flow, and shut (closed) to stop flow. Ports are openings in the valve body through which fluid can enter or leave. The plug in this kind of valve has one passageway going through it. The ports are typically at opposite ends of the body; therefore, the plug is rotated a fourth of a full turn to change from open to shut positions. This makes this kind of plug valve a quarter-turn valve. There is often a mechanism limiting motion of the handle to a quarter turn, but not in glass stopcocks. Slightly conically tapered metal (often brass) plug valves are often used as simple shut-off valves in household natural gas lines. It is also possible for a plug valve to have more than two ports. In a 3-way plug valve, flow from one port could be directed to either the second or third port. A 3-way plug valve could also be designed to shift flow between ports 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 1 and 3, and possibly even connect all three ports together. The flow-directing possibilities in multi-port plug valves are similar to the possibilities in corresponding multi-port ball valves or corresponding multi-port valves with a rotor. An additional possibility in plug valves is to have one port on one side of the plug valve and two ports on the other side, with two diagonal and parallel fluid pathways inside the plug. In this case the plug can be rotated 180° to connect the port on the one side to either of the two ports on the other side. Stopcocks used in laboratory glassware are typically forms of conically tapered plug valves. When fused with the glassware, the valve bodies are made of glass. Otherwise, they can be made of an inert plastic such as Teflon. The plugs can be made of a similar plastic or glass. When the plug is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When glass is used for both the stopcock body and the plug, the contacting surfaces between them are special ground glass surfaces (see Laboratory glassware) often with stopcock grease in between. Special glass stopcocks are made for vacuum applications, such as in use with vacuum manifolds. Stopcock grease is always used in high vacuum applications to make the stopcock air-tight. Also if the plug valve is \\"locked\\" from being in the open or closed position for an extended amount of time lubricant can be added through the greaser with the valve in service.

Recorded in 1997 at Sawmills Studios with producer Paul Reeve, it was released on 11 May 1998 by Dangerous Records, limited to 999 hand-numbered copies. The EP features four tracks, all of which were released again later – \\"Coma\\" was featured as the B-side to the band's second single \\"Cave\\", while the other three were re- recorded for the group's debut full-length album Showbiz. Recording and production The self-titled debut EP by Muse was recorded over a period of five days \\"in the autumn of 1997\\" at Sawmills Studios in Golant, Cornwall, with studio owner and Dangerous Records founder Dennis Smith agreeing to fund and arrange the sessions in return for payment if the band were later signed as a result of the release. Paul Reeve was tasked by Smith with leading production of the EP, partly due to the fact that senior engineer John Cornfield was currently working with Supergrass, and partly because Reeve and Muse frontman Matt Bellamy had \\"similar singing styles\\". The band recorded a total of ten songs during the sessions, later settling on \\"Overdue\\", \\"Cave\\", \\"Coma\\" and \\"Escape\\" for inclusion on the EP. \\"Cave\\" and \\"Coma\\" were also mixed by Reeve, while Cornfield mixed \\"Overdue\\" and \\"Escape\\". Promotion and release Muse was released on Dennis Smith's own independent record label Dangerous Records on 11 May 1998. The retail version was limited to 999 hand- numbered copies, while an additional 251 non-numbered promotional copies were produced for distribution to media contacts. Smith commented about the release that \\"I wasn't interested in making money selling records. That release was a pure statement of intent to the music industry, a way of raising [Muse's] profile\\". It was sold in a number of local independent record shops in Devon (such as KMA in Torquay and Solo in Exeter), as well as made available by mail order. The EP's artwork was created by the band's drummer Dominic Howard, who arranged three photocopied sections of his face into a \\"wonky visage\\". For promotional purposes, another copy of the EP was pressed with the title Sawmills Promo, featuring the same track listing (except for \\"Escape\\", which featured its original title of \\"Escape Your Meaningless\\"). Reception and legacy According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the Muse EP \\"sold slowly at first, creeping out of shops as word gradually spread\\" of the band; Muse: Inside the Muscle Museum author Ben Myers commented that it was met with \\"relative indifference\\". Writing in Out of This World: The Story of Muse, Beaumont claimed that \\"While the vitality and verve of 'The Muse EP' was enough to win over the casual listener, in retrospect it sounds like a band awkwardly finding their way around the recording studio and its techniques\\". Beaumont also criticised Bellamy's lyrical content on the release, describing \\"Overdue\\" as \\"crude\\" and \\"Escape\\" as \\"rambling\\".

It is a proprietary catalytic chemical process developed by UOP used in oil refineries and natural gas processing plants to remove mercaptans from LPG, propane, butanes, light naphthas, kerosene and jet fuel by converting them to liquid hydrocarbon disulfides. The Merox process requires an alkaline environment which, in some process versions, is provided by an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, commonly referred to as caustic. In other versions of the process, the alkalinity is provided by ammonia, which is a weak base. The catalyst in some versions of the process is a water-soluble liquid. In other versions, the catalyst is impregnated onto charcoal granules. Processes within oil refineries or natural gas processing plants that remove mercaptans and/or hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are commonly referred to as sweetening processes because they results in products which no longer have the sour, foul odors of mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide. The liquid hydrocarbon disulfides may remain in the sweetened products, they may be used as part of the refinery or natural gas processing plant fuel, or they may be processed further. Especially when dealing with kerosene, the Merox process is usually more economical than using a catalytic hydrodesulfurization process for much the same purpose. Indeed, it is rarely (if ever) required to reduce the sulphur content of a straight-run kerosene to respect the sulphur specification of jet fuel as the specification is 3000 ppm and very few crude oils have a kerosene cut with a higher content of sulphur than this limit. Types of Merox process units UOP has developed many versions of the Merox process for various applications: * Conventional Merox for extraction of mercaptans from LPG, propane, butanes or light naphthas.Merox Process for Mercaptan Extraction * Conventional Merox for sweetening jet fuels and kerosenes.Merox Process for Kerosene/Jet Fuel Sweetening * Merox for extraction of mercaptans from refinery and natural gases.Merox Process for Gas Extraction * Minalk Merox for sweetening of naphthas.Minalk Process for Fixed-Bed Naphtha Sweetening This process continuously injects just a few ppm of caustic into the feed naphtha. * Caustic-free Merox for sweetening jet fuels and kerosenes.Caustic-free Merox Process for Kerosene/Jet Fuel Sweetening This process injects small amounts of ammonia and water (rather than caustic) into the feed naphtha to provide the required alkalinity. *Caustic-free Merox for sweetening of naphthas.Caustic-Free Merox Process for Fixed-Bed Naphtha Sweetening This process also injects small amounts of ammonia and water (rather than caustic) into the feed naphtha to provide the required alkalinity. In all of the above Merox versions, the overall oxidation reaction that takes place in converting mercaptans to disulfides is: :4 RSH + O2 → 2RSSR + 2H2O The most common mercaptans removed are: * Methanethiol - CH3SH [m-mercaptan] * Ethanethiol - C2H5SH [e- mercaptan] * 1-Propanethiol - C3H7SH [n-P mercaptan] * 2-Propanethiol - CH3CH(SH)CH3 [2C3 mercaptan] * Butanethiol - C4H9SH [n-butyl mercaptan] * tert-Butyl mercaptan - C(CH3)3SH [t-butyl mercaptan] * Pentanethiol - C5H11SH [pentyl mercaptan] In some of the above Merox process versions, the catalyst is a liquid. In others, the catalyst is in the form of impregnated charcoal granules. Process flow diagrams and descriptions of the two conventional versions of the Merox process are presented in the following sections. Conventional Merox for extracting mercaptans from LPG The conventional Merox process for extraction and removal of mercaptans from liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), such as propane, butanes and mixtures of propane and butanes, can also be used to extract and remove mercaptans from light naphthas. It is a two-step process. In the first step, the feedstock LPG or light naphtha is contacted in the trayed extractor vessel with an aqueous caustic solution containing UOP's proprietary liquid catalyst. The caustic solution reacts with mercaptans and extracts them. The reaction that takes place in the extractor is: :2RSH + 2 NaOH → 2NaSR + 2 H2O In the above reaction, RSH is a mercaptan and R signifies an organic group such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl or other group. For example, the ethyl mercaptan (ethanethiol) has the formula C2H5SH. The second step is referred to as regeneration and it involves heating and oxidizing of the caustic solution leaving the extractor. The oxidations results in converting the extracted mercaptans to organic disulfides (RSSR) which are liquids that are water- insoluble and are then separated and decanted from the aqueous caustic solution. The reaction that takes place in the regeneration step is: :4NaSR + O2 \\\\+ 2H2O → 2RSSR + 4NaOH After decantation of the disulfides, the regenerated \\"lean\\" caustic solution is recirculated back to the top of the extractor to continue extracting mercaptans. The net overall Merox reaction covering the extraction and the regeneration step may be expressed as: :4 RSH + O2 → 2RSSR + 2H2O The feedstock entering the extractor must be free of any H2S. Otherwise, any H2S entering the extractor would react with the circulating caustic solution and interfere with the Merox reactions. Therefore, the feedstock is first \\"prewashed\\" by flowing through a batch of aqueous caustic to remove any H2S. The reaction that takes place in the prewash vessel is: :H2S + NaOH → NaSH + H2O The batch of caustic solution in the prewash vessel is periodically discarded as \\"spent caustic\\" and replaced by fresh caustic as needed. Flow diagram The flow diagram below depicts the equipment and the flow paths involved in the process. The LPG (or light naphtha) feedstock enters the prewash vessel and flows upward through a batch of caustic which removes any H2S that may be present in the feedstock. The coalescer at the top of the prewash vessel prevents caustic from being entrained and carried out of the vessel. The feedstock then enters the mercaptan extractor and flows upward through the contact trays where the LPG intimately contacts the downflowing Merox caustic that extracts the mercaptans from the LPG. The sweetened LPG exits the tower and flows through: a caustic settler vessel to remove any entrained caustic, a water wash vessel to further remove any residual entrained caustic and a vessel containing a bed of rock salt to remove any entrained water. The dry sweetened LPG exits the Merox unit. The caustic solution leaving the bottom of the mercaptan extractor (\\"rich\\" Merox caustic) flows through a control valve which maintains the extractor pressure needed to keep the LPG liquified. It is then injected with UOP's proprietary liquid catalyst (on an as needed basis), flows through a steam-heated heat exchanger and is injected with compressed air before entering the oxidizer vessel where the extracted mercaptans are converted to disulfides. The oxidizer vessel has a packed bed to keep the aqueous caustic and the water-insoluble disulfide well contacted and well mixed. The caustic- disulfide mixture then flows into the separator vessel where it is allowed to form a lower layer of \\"lean\\" Merox caustic and an upper layer of disulfides. The vertical section of the separator is for the disengagement and venting of excess air and includes a Raschig ring section to prevent entrainment of any disulfides in the vented air. The disulfides are withdrawn from the separator and routed to fuel storage or to a hydrotreater unit. The regenerated lean Merox caustic is then pumped back to the top of the extractor for reuse. Flow diagram of a conventional Merox process unit for extracting mercaptans from liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Conventional Merox for sweetening jet fuel or kerosene The conventional Merox process for the removal of mercaptans (i.e., sweetening) of jet fuel or kerosene is a one-step process. The mercaptan oxidation reaction takes place in an alkaline environment as the feedstock jet fuel or kerosene, mixed with compressed air, flows through a fixed bed of catalyst in a reactor vessel. The catalyst consists of charcoal granules that have been impregnated with UOP's proprietary catalyst. The oxidation reaction that takes place is: :4 RSH + O2 → RSSR + 2H2O As is the case with the conventional Merox process for treating LPG, the jet fuel or kerosene sweetening process also requires that the feedstock be prewashed to remove any H2S that would interfere with the sweetening. The reaction that takes place in the batch caustic prewash vessel is: :H2S + NaOH → NaSH + H2O Flow diagram The Merox reactor is a vertical vessel containing a bed of charcoal granules that have been impregnated with the UOP catalyst. The charcoal granules may be impregnated with the catalyst in situ or they may be purchased from UOP as pre-impregnated with the catalyst. An alkaline environment is provided by caustic being pumped into reactor on an intermittent, as needed basis. The jet fuel or kerosene feedstock from the top of the caustic prewash vessel is injected with compressed air and enters the top of the Merox reactor vessel along with any injected caustic. The mercaptan oxidation reaction takes place as the feedstock percolates downward over the catalyst. The reactor effluent flows through a caustic settler vessel where it forms a bottom layer of aqueous caustic solution and an upper layer of water-insoluble sweetened product. The caustic solution remains in the caustic settler so that the vessel contains a reservoir for the supply of caustic that is intermittently pumped into the reactor to maintain the alkaline environment. The sweetened product from the caustic settler vessel flows through a water wash vessel to remove any entrained caustic as well as any other unwanted water-soluble substances, followed by flowing through a salt bed vessel to remove any entrained water and finally through a clay filter vessel. The clay filter removes any oil-soluble substances, nonmetallic compounds (especially copper) and particulate matter, which might prevent meeting jet fuel product specifications. The pressure maintained in the reactor is injected air will completely dissolve in the feedstock at the operating temperature.

The Heavyweight Championship bout was first scheduled to take place at UFC 24, but was rescheduled due to a backstage accident involving Kevin Randleman, who slipped and fell on the concrete floor, sustaining a concussion. A bantamweight division was added at UFC 26 for fighters under 155 pounds; Jens Pulver defeated Joao Roque in the first ever UFC bantamweight bout. Lightweight was now 155-169.9 pounds, Middleweight 170-199.9 pounds, and Heavyweight 200+ pounds. This was the fourth event to feature now-regular referee, Mario Yamasaki in addition to \\"Big\\" John McCarthy. UFC 26 featured the second appearance of Matt Hughes in the UFC, who would go on to dominate the welterweight division. The event also marked the second UFC appearance of British fighter Ian Freeman, whose preliminary bout was shown on the live pay per view broadcast. UFC 26 was the fourth straight UFC event to have never received a home video or DVD release in the United States, as the UFC's parent company SEG was incurring financial difficulties, and would eventually sell the company to Zuffa just six months later.

The title of the book is taken from a poem by the First World War poet Wilfred Owen. The novel was first published by Hamish Hamilton in 1971 and then by Penguin Books in 1974. Characters Main characters *John George Glover Hilliard – The protagonist of the novel, John Hillard is a withdrawn character who begins the novel in a military hospital, recovering from a wound to the leg. He feels that his family have no understanding of the conflict and is relieved when he is able to return to France. *David Barton – The second main character in the novel is David Barton. A direct contrast to the character of Hilliard, he is a friendly man who is able to charm almost everyone he meets. Unlike John he has only recently arrived and is not aware of the realities of war. At the end of the novel Barton goes missing in action, presumed dead. Minor characters *Constance Hilliard – John Hilliard's mother. *Captain Franklin – An Adjutant. John argues with David that Franklin \\"has it in for us\\". Franklin is an unemotional character described in one of Barton's diaries as \\"someone with a head to lose but a heart? I wonder.\\" *Coulter – A soldier and familiar face to Hilliard. Coulter is the new batman who replaces Bates, who has been killed. Coulter dies in a raid on the German trenches at the end of the book. *Harris – A shell-shocked soldier who hides in the corner of a cellar; he is killed by a shell blast. *Colonel Garrett – David and John's commanding officer. He criticises the senior officers and describes the state of his battalion as \\"absolute bloody chaos\\". When Hilliard goes to see him he has yellow fingers and whisky by his side, suggesting that he has been drinking to cope with the stresses of war. *Beth Hilliard (Mrs. Henry Partington) – John Hilliard's sister. She tells John that she may marry Henry Partington. *Henry Partington – The lawyer that Beth marries. *Crawford – A doctor in the military hospital where Hilliard recovers from his wounds. Plot summary Part I The novel begins with the protagonist of the novel 'John Hilliard' in a military hospital, recovering from a wound he received; he briefly speaks to Crawford, a doctor, whom he knows from childhood and greatly dislikes. It is when Hilliard returns home that he has trouble sleeping. This is not because of his memories of war, but from being at home, a place which he greatly dislikes. The opening pages of the novel concern his brief period of sick leave back in England where his sister Beth, mother Constance and father are blind to the horror of the trenches. John finds it hard to adapt to life back in England and is happy to return to the war; especially after the new distance between him and his sister, to whom he was previously close. When Hilliard returns he finds that his batman and many other faces he knew have been killed. The group's Commanding Officer, Colonel Garrett, appears to have aged greatly in the short time Hilliard has been away, due to the stresses of war, and has taken to drinking quantities of whisky. His old batman is replaced with a new one called Coulter and he is placed in a room with a new Officer called David Barton in a rest camp while they wait to be called up to the front. During this time he becomes great friends with Barton, who is as yet untouched by the war. Throughout this chapter, the new Adjutant, a character called Franklin, appears expressionless and remote from the group. The chapter ends with Hilliard and Barton witnessing the wreckage of a German plane crash which shocks Barton, who has not seen a dead body yet. Part II In Part Two, the group that Hilliard and Barton are in, B Company, is travelling to the front line at Feuvry. There are not enough horses so David walks alongside for the duration of the journey. He writes a letter home describing what a terrible place Feuvry is; the town has few buildings left intact after being shelled and occupied by the Germans in 1914. When they arrive at their billets the Officers are informed that a soldier called Harris won't come out of the cellar. Harris is a new recruit who has broken down in terror; Barton manages to talk him round and lead him from the cellar. While Barton goes to fetch some rum ration for the still unstable Harris, a shell falls on the billets, killing Harris. Barton blames himself for the soldier's death because he would have been safe if Barton had not talked him out of the cellar. In another letter home Barton confesses that he has become hardened by his experiences in the war. He also states that John thinks that one of the most difficult experiences is getting used to the new faces as so many soldiers die. The chapter ends with Barton being chosen to go to the front lines to draw a map of the surrounding area with a runner called Grosse. In the front line he witnesses a shelling and the deaths of several men; he also sees a Private killed by a German sniper. After returning from the front line Barton admits that he feels that the war is changing him because he is unable to feel emotion for every soldier killed due to the sheer numbers killed each day. Part III The final chapter of the novel begins with one of Barton's long letters complaining that \\"we are drones not fighting men\\". He is concerned that his letter may be censored by the military but he wants to tell those back home the truth. John gets a letter stating that his sister Beth is to marry the lawyer Henry Partington which causes John to become angry at those back home. Hilliard and Barton are sent on a reconnaissance mission which requires the men to spy on the enemy trenches. They can see little and after a flare exposes their position they are forced to retreat with some casualties. Barton feels guilty that he left Coulter, the batman, to die in No Man's Land. In another letter home, Barton states that the constant death erodes his courage. Midway through the letter, the C.O. states that he is leaving the platoon after arguing with Generals that reconnaissance missions are a waste of lives. After this news, a Private called Parkin is worried about the news that they will soon be going over the top. Barton and Hilliard begin to talk about how they will meet after the war before they realise they are assuming that they both will survive. During the military advance, Barton and Hilliard lose track of each other's positions. Hilliard is injured by a shell and is forced to hide in a hole by several dead bodies. At nightfall he crawls back to his trench. His leg is amputated in France and at first he is too ill to return to England. The inconclusive end of the novel is Hilliard being informed by a letter from Barton's parents that Barton is missing and presumed dead. Hilliard writes to inform Barton's parents that it is extremely unlikely that Barton is alive. Once he gets back to England, he goes and visits Barton's family and friends, and feels he knows the place already from Barton's descriptions. Afterword * In the afterword to the novel Susan Hill explains that she did not intend \\"the conclusion to be drawn\\" that the relationship between the soldiers David Barton and John Hilliard is a physical one. She also writes that she hoped the novel would be seen as a novel as much on the subject of human love as 'war and the pity of war'. *In the afterword she goes on to state that a performance of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem made her want to write about the First World War: \\"But I was not at all prepared for the effect that performance War Requiem was to have on me. I came out feeling dazed, as though something very important had happened ...I cant exactly explain it or even describe it. But one result was that I became filled with the desire to write something myself about the First World War.

It centers around first-person exploration of a mysterious dungeon known as the Yggdrasil Labyrinth using a player-created party of characters. The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who criticized its punishing difficulty as limiting its appeal, but also making its gameplay more rewarding.  Plot  The game starts with the player forming an adventuring guild in order to explore the mysterious Yggdrasil Labyrinth from the nearby town of Etria. This is encouraged by the Radha and its chieftain, Visil, due to the town's prosperity stemming from exploration of the labyrinth. He uses the experienced ronin Ren and the hexer Tlachtga to teach the player how to explore the labyrinth and continue descending into each stratum. Once the player nears the lowest stratum of the labyrinth, they encounter a humanoid race known as the Forest Folk. The Forest Folk attempt to prevent the player from descending further, citing an ancient pact, but the player finally prevails against their massive guardian bird, the Iwaopeln. Entering the lowest stratum, they discover the ruins of a post-apocalyptic Shinjuku, Japan, revealing for the first time that the setting of the game is actually a far-future Earth. At this point, the player is confronted by Ren and Tlachtga, but this time to kill the player, claiming that if they are able to discover the secrets of the labyrinth, explorers would stop coming to Etria and the town would no longer prosper. However, the player defeats the two, and confronts Visil deeper in the labyrinth. Visil, who was actually the immortal lead researcher who created the Yggdrasil Project to restore the planet, merges with the core of Yggdrasil, becoming the Etreant in order to protect Yggdrasil. However, the player defeats him, destroying Yggdrasil.  Gameplay  Drawing comparisons to titles such as Wizardry and The Bard's Tale, Etrian Odyssey challenges players with exploring and mapping a vast dungeon. Players navigate through the dungeon in fixed increments. Time passes only when an action is taken, causing movement, random encounters, and combat to all be entirely turn-based. The game uses a first-person view to present the dungeon using a combination of relatively simple 3D computer graphics for environments and single-frame 2D sprites for enemies. Etrian Odyssey requires that players maintain their own map by annotating (with the stylus) a small map displayed on the DS's touchscreen. The player is free to map accurately or haphazardly. However, the player cannot draw their own symbols, and must instead use the game's limited set of pre-designed symbols. The game also limits the number of symbols that can be used for each level map. In addition to normal random encounters, the player must overcome \\"FOEs\\" (Field On Enemies), which are exceptionally powerful monsters which wander around the dungeon in much the same way as the player's party, advancing whenever the player does. The AI of FOEs varies, but most will wander the dungeon in a set circular path until they sense the player's party, after which they will move directly towards the party. If the player encounters an FOE in an area with multiple FOEs, it is possible for a second or even third FOE to join the battle if it reaches the party before they defeat the first one. Like most early RPGs, Etrian Odyssey uses custom characters from a number of different character classes. While only five characters can be in the party at a single time, a much larger number can be created and kept in waiting back at the \\"guild hall\\". Characters can be switched in and out of the party when in town, so if a given specialty is needed for a specific obstacle, the party can be tailored appropriately. The player allocates skill points to specific skills during level advancement.  Development  The title was first announced by Atlus through Famitsu after demonstrating it behind closed doors at E3 2006. The development team within Atlus was led by Kazuya Niinou who also directed the development of Atlus' first in-house game for the DS, Trauma Center: Under the Knife. The game features character designs by Yuji Himukai, monster design by Shin Nagasawa, a story by Shigeo Komori, and FM-like music by Yuzo Koshiro. The game was originally to be released internationally as Yggdrasil Labyrinth, but was renamed to avoid any possible confusion with Yggdra Union (a game published in North America by Atlus a year earlier) or Deep Labyrinth.  Reception  Etrian Odyssey sold 32,511 copies in its first week of release in Japan. Media Create/Famitsū reported that Etrian Odyssey had sold 119,584 copies in Japan as of July 1, 2007. Atlus' own July 2007 investors report listed US sales of the title at around 30,000 units, roughly 2 months after release. Elsewhere, the game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Although the title was recognized as accomplishing its goals (in terms of presenting a very classic RPG experience), it was noted that this greatly limits its appeal to a certain \\"hardcore\\" demographic. The IGN review noted, \\"[...] if you gave this game to ten players you may find one or two in the group that truly enjoy it\\". GamePro concurred, remarking, \\"Ultimately, this one is for fans of the genre and not for the short-on-time\\". Most reviews noted that those who enjoy rigorous dungeon crawls or fondly recall similar titles from years past may greatly enjoy the game. 1UP.com summarized this sentiment by concluding \\"Etrian Odyssey will definitely appeal more to the OCD'd than the ADD'd, and its punishing difficulty and very deliberate pacing may turn off younger gamers who grew up on flashier roleplayers. But it offers a real sense of wonder and a sense of accomplishment -- feelings missing from far too many modern games\\". N-Europe awarded the game an 8/10 score, though the site criticised its lack of story and the fact that it is \\"too old school for some\\".

The original station opened on 1 June 1877, as the terminus of the line from Morwell, before the line was extended to Stratford Junction on 8 May 1888.Sale VicsigVictorian Station Histories: Sale station This original station was located in the town of Sale itself, east of Reeve Street. It was a dead-end terminus, with the line from Melbourne and the line to Stratford both entering from the west. Trains continuing along the line beyond Sale were required to reverse at the station, or use the Traralgon- Maffra-Stratford line, which avoided Sale altogether. At the peak of operations, the yard had five roads, passenger and goods platforms, a goods shed, a 47-lever signal box, a cattle yard, an engine shed, a coal stage, and a turntable. There was also a short branch line to the Sale Wharf, as well as a number of industrial sidings in the area, serving cool stores, fuel depots, a gas works, a flour mill, woollen mills, and stockyards. After many years of discussions between the local council and rail authorities, the station was relocated in 1983, to a site outside the town, on a new section of track which linked the Melbourne and Stratford lines, without the need to run in and out of the original station. This formed a rail triangle for a short period of time. The goods facilities were first to be moved, on 28 September 1983, using part of the Sale – Stratford line as the base of the yard. The last train ran to the old station on 12 November 1983, with the new station officially opening on 4 December the same year. The last remnant of the railway line arriving directly into Sale was abolished in 1985, when parts of the former Port of Sale spur line were removed. Full signalling was not provided until 1987. Station staff were withdrawn in 1993, but have since been restored. Rail traffic beyond Sale ceased in December 1995, and Sale became the terminus for all trains on the line. Road coach services continued to Stratford, Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Orbost and further east, with some continuing into southern New South Wales. However, in mid-1999, log trains began running to Bairnsdale again, and the passenger service to Bairnsdale resumed on 3 May 2004. The original site of Sale station is now the Gippsland Centre Shopping Centre, although the signal box, level crossing gates, and two semaphore signals are statically preserved in situ. To the west of the station, the Sale Industrial Sidings remain in place but unused, as do the goods sidings. The sidings across from the platform were regularly used to allow Bairnsdale to Geelong log trains to cross passenger services, but log trains have ceased running.

Simultaneously, feminist anthropology challenges essentialist feminist theories developed in Europe and America. While feminists practiced cultural anthropology since its inception (see Margaret Mead and Hortense Powdermaker), it was not until the 1970s that feminist anthropology was formally recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Since then, it has developed its own subsection of the American Anthropological Association – the Association for Feminist Anthropology – and its own publication, Feminist Anthropology. Their former journal Voices is now defunct.  History  Feminist anthropology has unfolded through three historical phases beginning in the 1970s: the anthropology of women, the anthropology of gender, and finally feminist anthropology. Prior to these historical phases, feminist anthropologists trace their genealogy to the late 19th century. Erminnie Platt Smith, Alice Cunningham Fletcher, Matilda Coxe Stevenson, Frances Densmore—many of these women were self-taught anthropologists and their accomplishments faded and heritage erased by the professionalization of the discipline at the turn of the 20th century. Prominent among early women anthropologists were the wives of 'professional' men anthropologists, some of whom facilitated their husbands research as translators and transcriptionists. Margery Wolf, for example, wrote her classic ethnography \\"The House of Lim\\" from experiences she encountered following her husband to northern Taiwan during his own fieldwork. While anthropologists like Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict are representatives of the history of feminist anthropology, female anthropologists of color and varying ethnicities also play a role in the theoretical concepts of the field. Hortense Powdermaker, for example, a contemporary of Mead's who studied with British anthropological pioneer Bronislaw Malinowski conducted political research projects in a number of then a-typical settings: reproduction and women in Melanesia (Powdermaker 1933), race in the American South (Powdermaker 1939), gender and production in Hollywood (1950), and class-gender-race intersectionality in the African Copper Belt (Powdermaker 1962). Similarly, Zora Neale Hurston, a student of Franz Boas, the father of American anthropology, experimented with narrative forms beyond the objective ethnography that characterized the proto/pseudo-scientific writings of the time. Other African American women made similar moves at the junctions of ethnography and creativity, namely Katherine Dunham and Pearl Primus, both of whom studied dance in the 1940s. Also important to the later spread of Feminist anthropology within other subfields beyond cultural anthropology was physical anthropologist Caroline Bond Day and archeologist Mary Leakey. The anthropology of women, introduced through Peggy Golde's \\"Women in the Field\\" and Michelle Rosaldo and Louise Lamphere's edited volume Woman, Culture, and Society, attempted to recuperate women as distinct cultural actors otherwise erased by male anthropologists' focus on men's lives as the universal character of a society. Male anthropologists, Golde argued specifically, rarely have access to women in tribes and societies because of the sexual threat they pose to these women. As such, they receive the stories of men about women in instances when women are not present at all. The male anthropologists' ignorance and the indigenous men's domination congeal to create instances where, according to Rosaldo and Lamphere, the asymmetry between women and men become universal. The second anthropology of women would arise out of American engagements with Friedrich Engels' The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, arguing that this universal asymmetry was not timeless, but a product of capitalist relations that came to dominate the global mode of production through colonialism. As both approaches grew more vocal in their critique of male ethnographers' descriptions as one-sided, an 'add women and mix' approach to ethnography became popular, whereby women were not necessarily described at detail, but mentioned as part of the wider culture. Pdf. In the wake of Gayle Rubin and her critique of \\"the sex/gender system,\\" the anthropology of women transformed into anthropology of gender. Gender was a set of meanings and relationships related to but not isomorphic with biological sex. Women was not a universal community or category that was self-evident. Following the rise of women of color feminism, the anthropology of gender critiqued the early goals of first-wave feminists and anthropologists as overly concerned with bourgeois social ambitions. It did so through a move from documenting the experience of women as a universal population to interpreting the place of gender in broader patterns of meaning, interaction, and power. This includes the work of women anthropologists Henrietta Moore and Ethel Albert. Moore contended that anthropology, even when carried out by women, tended to \\"[order] the world into a male idiom [. . .] because researchers are either men or women trained in a male-oriented discipline\\". Anthropology's theoretical architecture and practical methods, Moore argued, were so overwhelmingly influenced by sexist ideology (anthropology was commonly termed the \\"study of man\\" for much of the twentieth century) that without serious self-examination and a conscious effort to counter this bias, anthropology could not meaningfully represent female experience. Today, feminist anthropology has grown out of the anthropology of gender to encompass the study of the female body as it intersects with or is acted upon by cultural, medical, economic, and other forces. This includes the expansion of feminist politics beyond cultural anthropology to physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archeology, as well as feminist anthropology becoming a site for connecting cultural studies, history, literature, and ethnic studies. Feminist Archaeology Feminist archaeology initially emerged in the late 1970s and early 80s, along with other objections to the epistemology espoused by the processual school of archaeological thought, such as symbolic and hermeneutic archaeologies. Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector’s 1984 paper Archaeology and the Study of Gender summed up the feminist critique of the discipline at that time: that archaeologists were unproblematically overlaying modern-day, Western gender norms onto past societies; for example in the sexual division of labor; that contexts and artifacts attributed to the activities of men, such as projectile point production and butchering at kill sites, were prioritized in research time and funding; and that the very character of the discipline was constructed around masculine values and norms. For example, women were generally encouraged to pursue laboratory studies instead of fieldwork (although there were exceptions throughout the history of the discipline)^ Hays-Gilpin, 2000:92. Feminist Scholarship in Archaeology. Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 571:89-106. and the image of the archaeologist was centered around the rugged, masculine, “cowboy of science”.^ Gero, 1985:342. Sociopolitics and the Woman-at-Home Ideology. American Antiquity 50:342-50 Recently, feminists in archeology have started to confront the issue of sexual assault during \\"field work\\" through scholarly research on the social life of archeologists. The Biological Anthropology Field Experiences Web Survey, open to bioarcheologists, primatologists, and other subfields, revealed that 19% of women are sexually assaulted during fieldwork, with 59% of anthropologists—male and female—experiencing sexual harassment.  Feminist Cultural Anthropology  Feminist cultural anthropology deals with the concept of feminism through the lens of cultural anthropology. When combining these two fields of study, cultural anthropology can be approached in a non-binary way. New information pertaining to research and knowledge from a scholarly perspective also has no restrictions. This field of study may impact feminism and women and gender studies as well because it provides feminist analyses of culture from an anthropological perspective. In the 1970s, women started attending undergraduate and graduate universities where the social sciences, which were at one time largely dominated by men, were now being practiced by men and women alike. With more women in the social science disciplines, they started having an impact on how some issues were being dealt with in the social science fields, such as the emphasis on gender studies and the integration of women’s rights issues into these studies. Women entering the social science fields had such a large impact on the feminist anthropology movement because before the 1980s, female anthropologists mostly focused on aspects such as family, marriage, and kinship. Many female anthropologists reacted to this stereotype placed on them, as they wanted to focus on broader aspects of culture in the scholarly community. When feminist anthropology first developed, it was intended to be the subdiscipline of the anthropology of women. However, feminist cultural anthropology arose as a subfield itself when anthropologists started to realize that women's and gender studies weren’t published as frequently as other topics in anthropology. As feminist anthropology began being practiced by more people and cultural aspects such as race, values, and customs started being considered, focuses on personal identity and differences between people in varying cultures became the main idea surrounding feminist cultural anthropology. With this advance, female anthropologists started focusing on all aspects of gender and sex and how they vary culturally. With a focus on feminism through an anthropological lens, women’s role in society and their contributions to the social sciences formed itself a new subfield known as feminist cultural anthropology. According to The Gender Sexuality Reader, modern anthropologists removed the father from the family without changing the basic social science concept of the family. The function of the family is child rearing, which is mapped onto a bounded set of people who share a place and love one another. Feminist anthropologists have found it difficult to apply the normal concept of family put forward by modern anthropologists as not all families display the same associated features.Jackson, Stevi (1998). Contemporary Feminist Theories. New York: New York University Press. pp. 73–82. .Jackson, Stevi (1998). Contemporary Feminist Theories. New York: New York University Press. pp. 73–82. .  Complex subjectivity  Subjectivity has become an increasing focal point for both Feminist scholars and anthropologists, as the notion of the subject has been becoming the center of more and more social theories.Jackson, Stevi (1998). Contemporary Feminist Theories. New York: New York University Press. pp. 73–82. . This new shared interest between these two groups has been posited by Stevi Jackson as the reason for the new partnership between feminists and anthropologists, as \\"\\"Complex Subjectivity is relational and these relations provide the possibilities for both similarity and difference to emerge.\\" Others argue that in order to move forward society there must be more focus on relationships of both similarity and difference, as produce in western theoretical practice and people's daily lives.Jackson, Stevi (1998). Contemporary Feminist Theories. New York: New York University Press. pp. 73–82. . Hybridity is considered by Jackson to be an important point within complex subjectivity, as it \\"is the mixing that brings forth new forms from previously identified categories.\\" Anthropologist and Feminist scholars have started to integrate the notion of the subject at the center of social theories, which Jackson states is complex because it discusses a notion of subjectivity that signifies society is moving away from what can be appropriately called the objective truth. This new idea of complex subjectivity is relational and these relations can provide the possibilities for similarities and differences to emerge. Relationship with Feminism The relationships of feminist anthropology with other strands of academic feminism are uneasy. By concerning themselves with the different ways in which different cultures constitute gender, feminist anthropology can contend that the oppression of women is not universal. Henrietta Moore argued that the concept of \\"woman\\" is insufficiently universal to stand as an analytical category in anthropological inquiry: that the idea of 'woman' was specific to certain cultures, and not a human universal. For some feminists, anthropologist Michelle Rosaldo wrote, this argument contradicted a core principle of their understanding of relations between men and women. Contemporary feminist anthropologist Marilyn Strathern argues that anthropology, which must deal with difference rather than seeking to erase it, is not necessarily harmed by this disagreement, but notes nonetheless that feminist anthropology faces resistance. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory. On the other hand, anthropologists' claims to include and engage with such other perspectives have in turn been criticized - local people are seen as the producers of local knowledge, which only the western anthropologist can convert into social science theory. Because feminist theorists come predominantly from the west, and do not emerge from the cultures they study (some of which have their own distinct traditions of feminism, like the grassroots feminism of Latin America), their ideas about feminism may contain western-specific assumptions that do not apply simply to the cultures they investigate. Rosaldo criticizes the tendency of feminists to treat other contemporary cultures as anachronistic, to see other parts of the world as representing other periods in western history - to say, for example, that gender relations in one country are somehow stuck at a past historical stage of those in another. Western feminists had, Rosaldo said, viewed women elsewhere as “ourselves undressed and the historical specificity of their lives and of our own becomes obscured”. Anthropology, Moore argued, by speaking about and not for women, could overcome this bias. Marilyn Strathern characterized the sometimes antagonistic relationship between feminism and anthropology as self- sustaining, since “each so nearly achieves what the other aims for as an ideal relationship with the world.\\". Feminism constantly poses a challenge to the androcentric orthodoxy from which anthropology emerges; anthropology undermines the ethnocentricism of feminism. The 'double difference' Feminist anthropology, Rayna Rapp argues, is subject to a 'double difference' from mainstream academia. It is a feminist tradition – part of a branch of scholarship, sometimes marginalized as an offshoot of postmodernism and deconstructionism and concerned with the experiences of women – who are marginalized by an androcentric orthodoxy. At the same time it addresses non- Western experience and concepts, areas of knowledge deemed peripheral to the knowledge created in the west. It is thus doubly marginalized. Moore argues that some of this marginalization is self-perpetuating. By insisting on adhering exclusively to the 'female point of view', feminist anthropology constantly defines itself as 'not male' and therefore as inevitably distinct from, and marginal to, mainstream anthropology. Feminist anthropology, Moore says, effectively ghettoizes itself. Strathern argues that feminist anthropology, as a tradition posing a challenge to the mainstream, can never fully integrate with that mainstream: it exists to critique, to deconstruct, and to challenge.

He became known for his unusual delivery that sometimes caused him to lose his cap after a pitch. Background Born in Brooklyn, New York, Pacella moved to Long Island in . After going 21-4 in three seasons at Connetquot High School in Bohemia, he was drafted by his hometown New York Mets in the fourth round of the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft. He was 32-35 with a 3.78 earned run average over four seasons in their farm system when he was called to the majors in . Major League career He made his major league debut out of the bullpen on his 21st birthday against the Philadelphia Phillies. After retiring the side in the seventh inning, Pacella walked the first batter he faced, Ted Sizemore, in the eighth. A botched pick off attempt allowed Sizemore to move to second. After he stole third, an error by Mets shortstop Doug Flynn put runners on the corners. Larry Bowa then drove Sizemore in with a single, while Ron Reed (who reached on Flynn's error) advanced to third. Pacella then uncorked a wild pitch allowing Reed to score. Though this could hardly be called a successful debut, he escaped without allowing an earned run. He made two more appearances by the end of the season; each time pitching one perfect inning. After spending all of in the minors, he returned to the Mets in as a September call-up. After pitching well in his first two appearances, he failed to make it out of the first inning in his third. For the season, he went 0-2 with a 4.41 ERA in four games. His only full season in the majors was . After starting the season in the bullpen, he was moved into the starting rotation in June. He earned his first major league win against Hall of Famer Steve Carlton and the Phillies on June 27, and improved to 3-0 with a 3.43 ERA on July 17 when he and Jeff Reardon combined to shut the Atlanta Braves out. Unfortunately, things went south from there as Pacella lost his next four decisions and finished the season at 3-4 with a 5.14 ERA. After the season, he and infielder José Moreno were traded to the San Diego Padres for Cy Young Award winner Randy Jones. The following Spring, the Padres dealt Pacella and Jerry Mumphrey to the New York Yankees for Ruppert Jones, Joe Lefebvre, Tim Lollar and Chris Welsh. After spending the season in triple A, Pacella won a job in the Yankees' bullpen out of Spring training . He made three appearances, getting hit hard in each, before being reassigned to triple A Columbus. Shortly after his arrival in Columbus, he was dealt to the Minnesota Twins with Pete Filson and Larry Milbourne for Roger Erickson and Butch Wynegar. He reported directly to the Twins, and remained with the club for the rest of the season despite a high 7.32 ERA. On November 1, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for Len Whitehouse. He failed to make the club out of Spring training, and was released just as the season was set to begin. During the season, he signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles. He earned a September call-up to the big league club in September , but was released at the end of the season. Shortly afterwards, he signed with the Detroit Tigers. He appeared briefly with the Tigers in the middle of the season. During the season, his contract was sold to the Yokohama Bay Stars of the Japanese Central League. Post- playing career Today, Pacella is a pitching instructor at Big League Baseball School in Ohio. He was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Baseball Category with the Class of 2017.

A predominantly rural parish, Gresham centres on its medieval church of All Saints. The village also once had a square 14th century castle, a watermill and a windmill. The moat and some ruins of the castle survive. History The name of Gresham is derived from a local stream known as the Gur Beck, plus -ham, meaning a settlement. In the Domesday Book of 1086, Gresham is recorded as one of the holdings of William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey.Hinde, Thomas, The Domesday Book, England's Heritage Then and Now (), p. 189 Sir Edmund Bacon of Baconsthorpe held the manor.Rye, Walter, Some Rough Materials for a History of the Hundred of North Erpingham (1883) p. 72 After his death in 1336 or 1337, there was much fighting over his property, which included the manor of Gresham. A William Moleyns married Bacon's daughter Margery and tried unsuccessfully to deprive John Burghersh, the son of Bacon's other daughter and heiress Margaret, of his inheritance. A partition of Bacon's property was made between his heirs in the 35th year of King Edward III, and when the division between Moleyns and Burghersh was complete, Gresham went to Margery, who died in 1399. She granted Gresham to Sir Philip Vache for nine years after her death, but in 1414 his widow still held it and Sir William Moleyns agreed to buy it from Margery's executors for 920 marks. He held it for two years, but did not complete the payment. The manor then fell into a complicated contract for the future marriage of Moleyns's daughter Katherine which did not take place, and Thomas Chaucer (c. 1367–1434), Speaker of the House of Commons, and the son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, acquired the manor of Gresham and sold it to William Paston. (Thomas Chaucer was married to a granddaughter of Maud Bacon, almost certainly another daughter of Edmund Bacon.Rye, Walter, Chaucer: a Norfolk man (1972) p. 58: \\"...but there is little doubt she was daughter of Sir Edmund Bacon of Gresham in Norfolk\\".) However, Robert Hungerford, Lord Moleyns, then claimed it and seized it by force.Richmond, Colin, The Paston Family in the Fifteenth Century: the First Phase (Cambridge University Press, 2002, ) pp. 47-50 at books.google.com, accessed 24 January 2009 Margaret Paston, in one of the Paston Letters, writing to her husband John Paston in a letter dated 19 May 1448, says: The James Gresham here referred to is James Gresham, gentleman, of Holt, who appears often in the Paston Letters as a confidential agent. Eight months later, when Paston's attempts to recover the manor through negotiation and legal action had failed, he sent his wife to occupy \\"a mansion\\" in the parish. In response, Moleyns sent an armed force which the Pastons claimed amounted to a thousand men, attacked the house, which was badly damaged, and expelled Margaret Paston.Castor, Helen, The King, the Crown, and the Duchy of Lancaster (Oxford University Press, 2000) p. 125, accessed 4 January 2009 Writing to her husband in a letter dated 28 September, Margaret Paston says: Moleyns was able to hold onto possession of Gresham for three years.

Walter Johnson, in Byways in British Archaeology, comments that \\"Its presence there was probably accidental, but it is well to recall the Breton practice of building stone axes into chimneys to ward off lightning\\".Johnson, Walter, Byways in British Archaeology (1912), pp. 79-80 In 1940, the executors of Joseph Cox of Gresham presented Norwich Castle Museum with a prehistoric handled beaker of the Bronze Age which had been found near Gresham.'A Handled Beaker from Norfolk' in Childe, V.

Although it was then seen as an Anglo-Catholic parish, the inside walls of the church are now bare and whitewashed, due to the efforts of the squire of the day, Colonel Batt, who was a determined Protestant, while his parish priest was an Anglo-Catholic. The Colonel demanded that all high church decorations be removed, the clergyman refused, and Batt took the matter to a consistory court and won. The case became famous, but it was one of the last of its kind. The parish registers for the years 1559 to 1969 are held in the Norfolk Record Office at Norwich.Gresham parish at nationalarchives.gov.uk, accessed 25 January 2009 For centuries, the church had its own rector, but it now shares a clergyman, who lives at West Runton, with neighbouring villages.

A general in the Republic of Korea Army, he served as Foreign Minister 1963 to 1964, and Prime Minister from 1964 to 1970. He was an ally of President Park Chung-hee. His pen name was Chungsa () Early life and education Korean War Dwight D. Eisenhower, Kim Baik-Il, Baik Seon-yup, Chung Il-kwon Chung was born in Ussuriysk in Primorsky Krai, Russia, where his father worked as an interpreter for the Imperial Russian Army. After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, his father moved the family to his hometown Kyongwon County, North Hamgyong province in Korea. However, in 1930, the family relocated to what is now Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Manchuria, where Chung grew up in extreme poverty. Because he was raised in Korea when it was still occupied by Japan, he was given the name of Ikken Nakashima. Career Due to his excellent grades in school, Chung won a place at the Manchukuo Imperial Army academy in Mukden, from which he graduated in September 1937. Again, his performance was regarded as excellent, and he was sent on to attend the 55th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in Tokyo, where he specialized in cavalry operations. He also assumed the Japanese name Nakajima Ikken (中島一權). During the Pacific War, he served in the Manchukuo Imperial Army as a military police captain. Following the Soviet invasion of Manchuria at the end of World War II, he was briefly captured by Soviet forces and interrogated by the KGB. Chung graduated from the first class of the Korea Military Academy in 1946 and was commissioned into the South Korean army. He was in Hawaii undergoing military training at the start of the Korean War. He arrived in Korea on June 30, and was immediately promoted to major general and replaced General Chae Byeong Deok as commander of the Republic of Korea Army. Serving as a tactical commander and then major general in the Korean War, Chun Il Kwon, organized the South Korean soldiers at Inchon. His initial responsibilities included regrouping the routed Korean military forces and coordinating their efforts with the United Nations command. He was the commander of all ROK forces in Pusan from July–August, which would place him at the attack of Inchon. This was known for incapacitated the North Korean Army and leaving him a well-known war hero. He returned to the United States for additional training in July 1951 following the National Defense Corps Incident and the Geochang massacre. However, on his return in July 1952 he was demoted by President Syngman Rhee to a divisional command and sent to a front-line combat unit. Three months later, he was promoted to deputy commander of the IX Corps (United States) commanding front line UN forces in numerous offensives and counteroffensives. Three months after this, he was again promoted to command the Korean II Corps, which he held until the end of the war. After retiring in 1957, he served as South Korea's ambassador to Turkey. In 1960, he was appointed ambassador to France, and then served as ambassador to the United States from 1960 to 1961 and 1962 to 1963. From 1963 to 1964 Chung served as Foreign Minister of South Korea and was Prime minister of South Korea from 1964 to 1970. During his time as an ambassador, he also took the time to study political science and international relations at prestigious universities such as Oxford and Harvard. From 1971, Chung served as a member of the National Assembly from the Democratic Republican Party for three consecutive terms. He also served as chairman in the ninth National Assembly of 1973–1979. In March 1991, Chung received treatment for lymph cancer in Hawaii. Although he continued political activities in 1992 for the Democratic Republican Party in 1993, particularly in support of Kim Young-sam during the 1992 Korean presidential election, he was re-hospitalized in Hawaii in January 1994 due to cancer, and died there. He received a state funeral and was buried at the Seoul National Cemetery. Survived by his four children and his wife, Park Hye-Soo, after his death in Hawaii.

It is the co- cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. Freising Cathedral is also known for being the place where Pope Benedict XVI was ordained a priest. History View of the rococo interior with the high altar in the background An early church was present on the site by AD 715, consecrated as episcopal church by Boniface in 739. A triple nave was constructed in 860 and rebuilt after a fire in 903. The church was completely destroyed by fire on Palm Sunday, 5 April 1159. Construction of the current romanesque building started in 1159 and completed in 1205. The romanesque wooden ceiling was replaced by a gothic vault in 1481-3\\\\. The tomb of St. Corbinian, the patron saint of the bishopric, is located in the four-nave crypt of the cathedral. In the centre of this crypt one of the most distinguished sculptures in Europe is located: the Bestiensäule (\\"pillar of beasts\\"), carved in the high Middle Ages. Substantial reconstruction was undertaken during the Baroque period, beginning in 1619. A complete renovation begun in 1621, and its nearly completed high altar was consecrated on 1 January 1624. In 1623, Prince-Bishop Veit Adam von Gepeckh of Freising commissioned Hans Rottenhammer (1564-1625) to paint a vast altarpiece. Rottenhammer was near the end of his career (and life) and possibly an alcoholic, and his work was delayed. The commission was transferred to Rubens at an unknown time.a letter by Empress Eleonora dated 10 December 1624 refers to the altar as nearly complete, but it is unclear whether the painting was still in charge of Rottenhammer or already handed over to Rubens at that time. Rubens completed the painting of the Woman of the Apocalypse, a subject that had been very popular in German iconography since the 15th century. The bishop had commissioned a subject \\"applicable to all feast days of the Blessed Virgin\\" (so sich auf alle unser Lieben Frauen Fest applizieren liesse), which made the Madonna of the Revelation, associated in Counter-Reformation iconography with both the Assumption of the Virgin and the Immaculate Conception, an apt choice. The finished painting is first mentioned in 1632, when it was evacuated from the advancing Swedish troops. It is now kept in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich.Peter C. Sutton , Peter Paul Rubens, The Virgin as the Woman of the Apocalypse , The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles Another renovation was undertaken in 1724, in view of the church's thousand-year anniversary. The rococo decoration of the interior created is a work of Cosmas Damian Asam and Egid Quirin Asam. In the 1920s, some of the frescoes were painted over and severely damaged. These were restored in 2006. References * Mark Bankus: Der Freisinger Domberg und sein Umland. Untersuchungen zur prähistorischen Besiedlung.

He was the great great nephew of the Archbishop of Canterbury John Tillotson. In 1776, he was commissioned as a First lieutenant in the Maryland Militia, and served during the American Revolutionary War. He was appointed by Congress as a physician and surgeon general of the Northern Department of the Continental Army in 1780, and served until the close of the war. Afterward, he settled in Rhinebeck, New York and engaged in the practice of medicine. In 1779, he married Margaret Livingston (1749–1823, sister of Chancellor Robert R. Livingston). Their children included Robert, John, and Janette. Janette was the wife of Judge James Lynch. A Federalist, he represented Dutchess County in the New York State Assembly in 1788. In 1790, State Senator Anthony Hoffman died, and Tillotson was elected to fill the vacancy. He was a member of the State Senate from 1791 to 1799, and served as a member of the Council of Appointment in 1791. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 7th United States Congress in 1800, but resigned on August 10, 1801, before Congress met, to become Secretary of State of New York. He remained in this office until March 15, 1806, and again from February 16, 1807 to February 1, 1808. He died in Rhinebeck on May 5, 1832 was buried in the Livingston family vault in the cemetery at the Dutch Reformed Church in Rhinebeck. Linwood Tillotson's estate in Rhinebeck was known as \\"Linwood\\". It was originally part of the Artsen-Kip Patent. Tillotson purchased from Isaac Van Etten the southerly lot forming part of the lands which had been granted in 1688 by Governor Dongan to Gerrit Aertsen and others. It was bounded on the south and west by the Hudson River and on the east by the stream known as Landsmans Kill, which also formed the westerly boundary of the Beekman patent. On this property Dr. Tillotson in the years 1788-1790 laid out a country place and called it \\"Linwood.\\" His house commanded a magnificent view of the river. He then acquired 150 acres of the Beekman land lying between Landsmans Kill and Fallsburgh Creek. This plateau, between the two streams, with extensive views of the Catskill mountains and Hudson river, became known as Linwood Hill. At the mouth of Landsmans Kill he built a dock and mill, where grain was ground. Dr. Tillotson also obtained at this time another part of the Beekman lands, twenty-nine acres of woodland lying east of Fallsburgh Creek, where two beautiful waterfalls bring it to the river level. This portion of the property became known as \\"Glenburn\\".Historical and Genealogical Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A. V. Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912 In 1830, Tillotson gave \\"Glenburn\\" to his granddaughter, Julia Lynch, who later married Rev. Stephen Olin, President of Wesleyan University.

Biography Haddon was born at Croydon, England, the son of Richard Haddon, a schoolmaster and landscape artist, and his wife Mary Caroline, née Wykes. Haddon was educated at private schools and in 1859 became assistant-secretary of the Statistical Society of London and of the Institute of Actuaries. Haddon resigned these positions in 1863 to accept an engagement with The Argus, Melbourne. Haddon arrived in Melbourne in December 1863 was soon made sub- editor. When the new weekly The Australasian was established in 1864, Haddon became its first editor, and in January 1867 was made editor of The Argus at 27 years of age. It was a period of great developments in Victoria, and under Haddon's editorship the Argus, while distinctly conservative served a most useful purpose in advocating the claims of the primary producers, and endeavouring to keep protective duties within reasonable bounds. It fought with success for non-political control of government departments and purity of administration, with the result that Victoria set a high standard among the colonies in these matters. Richard Twopeny, described The Argus as 'the best daily paper published out of England'. When Graham Berry and Charles Henry Pearson went as an embassy to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1879, Haddon, who was visiting England in that year, was asked by some of their opponents to set the facts of the controversy before the \\"government, parliament and press of Great Britain\\". He compiled a pamphlet which was printed in London, The Constitutional Difficulty in Victoria. This was sent to all the members of the British parliament and to the press. Haddon also personally interviewed leading statesmen and editors, and probably was a strong influence on the non-success of the mission. There was not really, however, a strong case for British interference. On his return from Britain, Haddon went back to his editorial chair. He was of a dispassionate nature and set a high standard in the discussion of public matters. The Argus fought well for federation, which had practically become certain when Haddon in 1898 resigned his editorship to take up the important task of representing the Edward Wilson Estate on the management of the Argus and Australasian. Haddon was Melbourne correspondent for The Times in 1895–1903, and was president of the Victorian Poultry and Kennel Club. Haddon died at Melbourne on 7 March 1906. Haddon was married twice: firstly to Annie Jane King (died 1875) and secondly to Alice Annie Good on 31 January 1883 who survived him with a daughter by the first marriage. Haddon appreciated good writing and was always ready to encourage it. As an editor, he refused to be affected by popular excitement, and though his paper was on occasions criticized for not taking a stronger stand, he probably did all that could be done when it is remembered how strong the remarkable personality of David Syme had made The Age, which for a great part of the period was issued at a lower price than the Argus, and had a much larger circulation.

As a pioneer in weather forecasting, he was the first Canadian to present the weather in satellite and radar images and to give road reports and forest fires. He also hosted numerous public affairs programs on CBC and, in 1969, along with Lloyd Robertson, he hosted ten days of coverage of the first moon landing for CBC Television. Early life Born in Winnipeg, his family moved to Neudorf, Saskatchewan to operate a general store. In 1925, they moved to Vancouver, British Columbia where he studied at King George Secondary School and the University of British Columbia. He was the eldest of four children of Solomon and Elizabeth Saltzman. His father and mother had immigrated to Canada from Ukraine in 1911. He was a good student and won the Governor-General Lord Willingdon's Silver Medal for coming in first in the province in his final high school exams. In the 1930s he was a political activist and once shared a stage with Stafford Cripps at a Vancouver socialist rally. Saltzman maintained his left-wing convictions into later life. His son, Paul, said of him \\"(h)e came out of the Depression in Western Canada and that kind of skewed his values. He was an armchair socialist, but that didn't translate into action.\\" After their Vancouver grocery store failed, Saltzman's parents moved to Los Angeles along with his youngest brother, Kenneth Saltzman and he rarely saw them. His younger brother, Morris Saltzman remained in Vancouver until his death in 1988. For his activism in bringing different religious and cultural factions to respect one another and work together, Morris received the Order of Canada several years before Percy was so honoured. Saltzman moved to Montreal and studied medicine at McGill University School of Medicine until 1935 when he met and married his first wife, Rose Kogan (1911–1988), in 1935. He dropped out of medical school around this time and took a series of odd jobs such as working in a clothing store, an envelope opener in a puzzle contest and as a waiter before entering the printing business. He then moved with her to Toronto in 1937 where he worked as a Linotype operator at Eveready Printing, the Communist Party of Canada's printshop, for several years. In 1943, he became a meteorology officer for the weather service of the federal government and was attached to the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan for the remainder of World War II. He would retain his position with the Dominion Weather Service for 25 years. It was essentially an extension of this function for him to be given the opportunity to bring his expertise first to radio beginning in 1947 and later to television as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, another Canadian government agency, embarked on this new medium. \\"He kept that job at the weather office the entire time he was on television with CBC because he didn't think TV was secure. He wasn't sure that TV would last,\\" said his grandson, CBC reporter Aaron Saltzman. Television career Saltzman was the first person to appear on CBC Toronto (CBLT) English-language television when the service was launched on September 8, 1952 (the bilingual CBFT in Montreal opened two days earlier). Initially, he gave the weather on a puppet show, Uncle Chichimus and Hollyhock, but he soon delivered forecasts on Stop Watch and Listen and then became co-host of Tabloid, the CBC's daily current affairs and interview show His first major story was Hurricane Hazel which hit Toronto just over two years after his television career began. He was a staple at CBC through the following decades and was initially paid $10 for each appearance. While pursuing what he considered a sideline career on television, he remained with the Dominion Weather Service and rose to the position of head of the verification section finally leaving in 1968 to join the CBC full-time. During his stint at CBC he hosted a multitude of special shows and also developed into one of Canada's best interviewers. He left the network in 1972 to become a co-host of CTV's new morning show Canada AM. His presentations, before the introduction of such amenities as computer-enhanced satellite displays and graphics, involved a blackboard and chalk as he drew maps, suns, clouds, snowflakes, fronts, etc., ending with his signature toss of the chalk, and his \\"and that's the weather picture\\" as he caught it. (He is said to have always caught it, although he admitted having dropped it once, but only once.) Saltzman once estimated he had done 9,000 weather forecasts on radio and television and interviewed more than 1,000 people. He used no notes or teleprompters relating his forecasts entirely from memory. After leaving CTV, he worked at CITY-TV in 1974 (Free For All), then he became a freelancer until 1980 when he joined Global TV for the next two years. He also broadcast local radio weather reports in Toronto at CBC Radio, CKEY, and CFRB. Later life In 1990 he married his second wife, Grace Audrey Ford (née Modeland). He has two sons from his first marriage, Earl (born 1942) and Paul (born 1943). His brother Kenneth lives in Los Angeles. His grandson Aaron Saltzman is a reporter, first with CBC Television in Calgary and now in Toronto. Saltzman's only granddaughter, Devyani Saltzman, is the author of the internationally published literary memoir: Shooting Water and is the daughter of Paul Saltzman and filmmaker Deepa Mehta. Paul Saltzman is an Emmy Award- winning film and TV producer and director whose most recent film was the documentary Prom Night in Mississippi, featuring actor Morgan Freeman. Saltzman was the nephew of Communist Party of Canada organizer Sam Carr. Saltzman died on January 15, 2007 in Toronto. He is buried at York Cemetery in Toronto.

History The parish of Little Island dates to the seventh century, and tidal mills have been excavated dating to c. 630 AD. By the fourteenth century the parish was known as De Insual, meaning \\"of the island\\". The current Church of Ireland parish church was built in 1865 in the Gothic Revival style. A limestone quarry on Little Island was the source of thousands of tons of limestone annually, which were used in the construction of public buildings nationally, including Cork's City Hall and Holy Trinity Church. Ancient protected structures, as recorded on the Record of Monuments and Places, include examples of fulacht fiadh, middens, corn-drying kilns, the remains of a medieval church and graveyard, and the 15th or 16th century tower house known locally as Wallingstown Castle. Development A number of Cork's pharmaceutical companies are based on the island. The main drainage wastewater treatment plant for Cork City was also opened in the area in 2004. Since the 1990s, development has grown, with retail and commercial spaces opened at Little Island Business Park and East Gate Retail Park. As of 2017, the Little Island Business Association reported that there were approximately one thousand businesses operating in the area. Over seven thousand people were employed in the area, which was described as one of Ireland's \\"industrial powerhouses,\\" as of April 2018. Cork Golf Club is also based on Little Island.

In the village is Brinton Hall which was constructed in the Georgian era to replace an earlier 16th-century house. The house seen today was rebuilt in 1822 by Brereton family. The interior has a fine wainscot staircase, installed in 1911.Investigation of the history of Nelson's Staircase Award-winning work at Brinton Hall includes remodelling of the west front and renovation of all interior rooms. In the grounds there are formal gardens, the hall also has a walled kitchen garden with a hot greenhouse. The property is surrounded by parkland with ha-ha wall, lake, woods and meadows. The village and some of its houses were once used as a backdrop for the BBC television series Dangerfield. Parish church The parish church is dedicated to St Andrew and parts date back to the 14th century.Norfolk 1: Norwich and North-East, By Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson, Brinton entry. The church register dates from 1547. The church tower dates from c.1400 and has one bell. There is a statue of Saint Andrew in a niche above the transept which dates from the Medieval period. The statue only survives because it had been screened with plasterwork to hide it. It was rediscovered in 1871.

Life and career Braakensiek had a successful career as a model, with some acting work, for over twenty-five years. She told the Daily Telegraph in 2017 that she had never really wanted to be a model.Daily Telegraph, 8 January 2019, p.9 She said that she had deferred her university studies, thinking she would do modelling for a year, but was still doing it 25 years later. She also worked as a jewelry and lingerie designer, and was a vegan blogger as well as creating the catering company Love Lunch. Braakensiek graced the covers and pages of magazines incudling FHM, Maxim and GQ. Braakensiek became an ambassador for Australian mental health charity R U OK?.

It was formed in 1995 and signed to Indecision Records in 1996. They signed to the larger label \\"next door\\", Dexter Holland's Nitro Records in 1998 and finally came to rest at Blackout Records in 2003 after a brief sortie back to Indecision in 2000. History The beginning - 1995 The band was formed in New Brunswick, New Jersey by Chris Ross (drums), Walt Svekla (bass) and John Fraunberger (guitar) in 1995 and self-produced a demo. In the search for a new vocalist, they found Tim Shaw who was a roadie with Sick Of It All, a band in the New York Hardcore scene. Indecision years 1996 - 1998 The band went to California and signed for Indecision Records and in May, 1996 released a self-titled 7\\" four track EP. After this, Walt Svelka and Chris Ross departed and were replaced by Nate \\"Edge\\" Gluck (ex-Strength 691, Vision) and Ryan Murphy (ex-Undertow) respectively. In mid-1997, Fall from Grace, another four track 7\\" EP, was released. John Fraunberger then left the band to take up a teaching degree, but not before recording material for the first full-length album, Direction of Things to Come which came out in November, 1997. Fraunberger was replaced on guitar by Ryan \\"Mackenzie\\" Donoghue as the band took to the road. In 1998, the band decided to cast their net further and sign for Nitro Records which had a larger distribution network. Also in 1998, three live tracks appeared on an Indecision Records 7\\" Devil's Night, with other artists from the label - the remainder of the live set would later feature on the Three Years Two Months Eleven Days album. Nitro years 1998 - 2002 Although the band had switched labels, they retained the services of the same recording studio (Trax East, South River, New Jersey) and the same producer (Steve Evetts) as their debut on Indecision for the next full-length outing, Cast the First Stone released in March, 1999. While on tour in Ireland, Ryan Murphy decided to leave the band and was replaced by John \\"Vince Vegas\\" O'Neill. Before touring Europe in 2000, Ryan Donoghue left the band which, although was on very good terms, left the band with a situation. Nate solved it by employing Chris Oliver for bass duties on the tour (teaching him along the way) while taking up the guitar duties himself. Back at Indecision - April 2000 In April, 2000, Indecision Records released a retrospective album of Ensign material, entitled Three Years Two Months Eleven Days - the precise amount of time the band had spent on the label. It consisted of the first 7\\" plus three tracks from the same recording session, the Fall from Grace 7\\" plus two more from the same session, two otherwise unreleased tracks, two tracks from just after the release of Direction of Things to Come sessions and, finally, six tracks recorded live in 1998 at the Showcase Theater in Corona, California - three of which had previously appeared on the Indecision Records 7\\" Devil's Night. Nitro/Indecision 2000 In June, 2000, the band recorded four tracks in New York for an EP called For What It's Worth which was released in October 2000. They also recorded two tracks which would end up on a Split 7\\" EP with Death By Stereo released by Indecision Records in December 2000, and a further two tracks which were released on a split 7\\" with Reaching Forward on European label, Reflections Records. Nitro years (continued) In November 2000, the band entered the studio to start recording their third full-length release, The Price of Progression. Chris Byrnes came in December to add some second guitar parts as Nate was performing on bass and guitar, as well as the usual backing vocals. Chris Oliver had played bass on the initial takes as a favor to Nate, and continued to play for a while after. The band were also joined on vocals for guest spots by Russ Rankin of Good Riddance and Andy West of Kill Your Idols. The record was finally released in April, 2001. Also, in February 2001, Indecision Records re-released their split 7\\" with Death By Stereo on CD as part of their Split Series compilation. In 2002, they headed out on a Canadian tour supporting metalcore band, Hatebreed. A tour of Europe with Avail followed in 2003. Blackout years - 2003 to present The band found a regular guitarist in Frank Piegaro in 2002, while John O'Neill had been replaced by Brian \\"Pnut\\" Kozuch in 2001. They took to a studio in Hoboken, New Jersey and in seven days recorded twenty cover versions of artists such as Bad Brains, Descendents, Dag Nasty, Hüsker Dü, Misfits and Discharge, all seminal punk bands who had influenced members of Ensign in their formative years. The record was released in October, 2003, on Blackout Records - they had agreed to do this for label owner, Bill \\"Blackout\\" Wilson, with Tim Shaw having worked with and for him during the early Indecision Records days - and it was called Love the Music, Hate the Kids. In Europe, it was released by German label, JoinTheTeamPlayer. Ensign in the United Kingdom In November 2003, UK- based record label, Household Name released a split EP with Ensign and Leeds, UK based hardcore band Fig 4.0. It featured three tracks from Ensign: \\"A Place\\", \\"Circa 1985\\" and \\"Three Can Keep A Secret\\" and was limited to 500 releases on 7\\" vinyl.

He was the eldest son of Jobst of Limburg Stirum. Family He married baroness Anna Magdalena von Spiess (1599—1659) in 1618 and had four children: *Otto, count of Limburg, Bronckhorst, Wisch and Borculo, hereditary banneret of the Principality of Guelders and of the county of Zutphen (born 1620, died 1679); *Adolf Ernst, count of Limburg Styrum, Sovereign Lord of Gemen (died 1657); *Moritz, count of Limburg and Bronkhorst, Lord of Styrum; and *Sophie Elisabeth (died 1686), who married Count Ferdinand Gottfried von Vehlen und Meggen. Military career Hermann Otto served in the armies of the Dutch Republic. He commanded Christian of Brunswick's rearguard at the Battle of Stadtlohn (1623)Peter H. Wilson, Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years' War, Allen Lane, 2009, p. 342. and the Dutch cavalry at the Siege of Groenlo (1627). Heritage At his death, Hermann Otto divided his possessions amongst his three sons. *Otto received Bronckhorst, Borculo and all the Dutch possessions; he founded the older line of the House, still alive today in Belgium and the Netherlands. *Adolf reigned over Gemen and Illereichen until his death in 1657. He founded the line of Limburg Stirum Gemen. In 1782, with extinction of Gemen branch, Gemen was passed to the Barons of Bomelberg in 1800, and was mediatized to the Princes of Salm-Kyrburg in 1806. It passed to France in 1810, then to Prussia in 1814. *Moritz received the ownership of Mülheim an der Ruhr and thereby of the immediate lordship of Styrum, and later Oberstein. Here he founded the line of counts of Limburg-Styrum-Styrum, extinct in 1809. In the mediatisation of 1806, Styrum came under control of the Grand Duchy of Berg. Oberstein was mediatized at the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801, however the Limburg Stirum were never compensated by the Final Recess in 1803. All members of the House of Limburg-Stirum descend from Hermann Otto, but also a great number of monarchs, such as the present members of the Habsburg-family, the king of Belgium and the Grand-Duke of Luxemburg.

The organisation has responsibility for the safety and security of the Irish Defence Forces, its personnel, and supporting the national security of Ireland. The directorate operates domestic and foreign intelligence sections, providing intelligence to the Government of Ireland concerning threats to the security of the state and the national interest from internal and external sources. Military Intelligence is a constituent part of Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) and is the intelligence section of all Defence Forces branches. The Directorate of Military Intelligence draws staff from the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. The Irish military special operations forces, the Army Ranger Wing (ARW), carries out physical tasks in support of Military Intelligence in Ireland and overseas, and the Communications and Information Services Corps (CIS) provides technical and electronic support. \\"J2\\" works closely with the Garda Síochána Special Detective Unit (SDU), the national police counter-terrorism and counter- espionage unit.  Mission and organisation  McKee Barracks in Dublin is the reported headquarters of the Directorate of Military Intelligence Military Intelligence is also believed to operate out of the Defence Forces Headquarters complex in Newbridge, County Kildare The duties of the Defence Forces Directorate of Military Intelligence are; :* The provision of security and intelligence in relation to the state and its national interests, both domestic and foreign, and; :* To provide operational intelligence and security to deployed Irish forces globally. The Directorate of Military Intelligence staffs members drawn from the entire Defence Forces (Army, Naval Service and Air Corps), who then serve on a full-time basis with J2. Military Intelligence personnel regularly train, liaise and deploy with foreign intelligence, government and non-government agencies to share knowledge and best practice. This ensures they keep abreast of threats and are able to collate essential intelligence to further protect the state, the Defence Forces and its interests. The service is under the command of a Colonel, known as the Director of Military Intelligence, who provides regular intelligence briefings to the Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations), Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Secretary-General of the Department of Defence. The Director provides a monthly intelligence briefing in-person to the Minister for Defence. The Chief of Staff briefs the cabinet on matters of state security, as well as the secretive National Security Committee (NSC). The organisation's number of employees and budget are classified, with a further 150-200 operatives in the Army Ranger Wing (ARW), who can conduct missions at the behest of Military Intelligence. Funding comes from the overall Department of Defence budget (€1.16 billion in 2012). The only publicly known funding is that for the budget to pay confidential informants, through the \\"Secret Service\\" budget, which is shared with the Garda Crime & Security Branch (CSB). In 2014, this figure was €1 million. Operatives from the Directorate of Military Intelligence can carry firearms on operations both at home and abroad, and those in the Directorate may not wear uniforms on operations. The Garda Special Detective Unit (SDU) works closely with the Intelligence Branch on domestic matters. Military Intelligence operates out of a number of locations in Dublin and County Kildare, and their headquarters are understood to be based at McKee Barracks, Dublin and the Department of Defence Headquarters in Newbridge, County Kildare. The latter is rumoured to house sophisticated modern technology for espionage, the building was completed in 2010 after a number of years of construction, at a cost of €30 million. Intelligence and language training takes place at the Military College, Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC), Curragh Camp. In Ireland, national security is primarily the responsibility of the Garda Síochána (national police service), while the Defence Forces are responsible for intelligence.  Structure   Defence Intelligence Section  The Directorate of Military Intelligence Defence Intelligence (DI) Section is staffed by military commissioned and non-commissioned officers. It is tasked with providing intelligence support to the Defence Forces. Staff actively monitor relevant political, economic, social and military situations globally to produce intelligence reports and strategic studies to support operations. Personnel in this section can be found briefing all the way up to the Minister for Defence. The Directorate is responsible for conducting background checks of all Defence Forces personnel through close cooperation with the Garda National Vetting Bureau (GNVB). The Defence Intelligence Section is tasked with keeping members of the Defence Forces safe, be it in Ireland or abroad during active military engagements. The Army Ranger Wing Intelligence Section deploys in foreign countries alongside Military Intelligence soldiers during Irish military deployments, which are generally peacekeeping missions on behalf of the United Nations, European Union and NATO (Partnership for Peace), due to Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  National Security Intelligence Section  The Directorate of Military Intelligence National Security Intelligence Section (NSIS) deals with threats to the state and the Defence Forces. This includes identifying, monitoring and assessing possible threats to the state and Irish national interests at home and abroad, be it by hostile intelligence services, terrorist groups and/or criminal organisations. Counter-intelligence forms a large part of the section's remit, in addition to fulfilling counter- terrorist, counter-subversion, counter-insurgency, counter-sabotage roles, and physical security of critical infrastructure. The National Security Intelligence Section works very closely with the Garda SDU and Garda National Surveillance Unit (NSU) to spy on potential terrorism threats, particularly from Islamic terrorists and dissident republicans. Military Intelligence have a number of Arabic speakers in their ranks as a result of Defence Forces deployments overseas. Separately, outside of Defence Forces Headquarters, the Naval Service maintains a Naval Intelligence Cell within its Intelligence and Fishery Section at Naval Operations Command, Haulbowline Naval Base, Cork Harbour, which is responsible for the collection, collation and dissemination of Naval Intelligence. The Air Corps maintains an Air Intelligence Section at its HQ at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, Dublin responsible for aviation intelligence. Army Brigades maintain their own regional intelligence function - designation \\"G2\\" - reporting into J2.  History  Founded in the mid-1920s following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Office of the Directorate of Intelligence was originally the intelligence arm of the Irish Army, hence its code-name \\"G2\\", which is a designation in NATO's continental staff system used to refer to an army intelligence, security, and information branch. Later the Directorate became the intelligence service for the entire Irish armed forces, hence it is now referred to as \\"J2\\" (which refers to joint services, i.e. the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps) and took on more national security roles. G2 spent much of its early efforts combating the Anti-Treaty IRA, in the Republic of Ireland, and also operated in Northern Ireland. World War II G2 first came to public attention during World War II (1939-1945), known in Ireland as The Emergency. Although Ireland had a policy of military neutrality and was \\"non-belligerent\\" during WWII, G2 formed secret agreements with the United Kingdom's Military Intelligence Section 5 (MI5) and the United States' Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). During this period, G2 intercepted German naval and aerial communications through listening stations located across Ireland, sharing the information with Allied forces. Under the legendary Colonel Daniel \\"Dan\\" Bryan, Director of Intelligence, G2 apprehended all thirteen Nazi spies sent to Ireland, notably Hermann Görtz, and broke German codes during the war, under the supervision of cryptologist Richard J. Hayes. During this period, G2 also undertook intelligence operations in Europe, including a notable covert mission in April 1943 where G2 officers travelled to neutral Portugal by flying boat, using the cover of the Irish Red Cross delivering supplies to refugees in Spain, in order to gather information on the Irish minister (precursor to ambassador) in Madrid whom the Irish government had become increasingly suspicious about, due to his close links with Germany. Leopold H. Kerney had been visited by Edmund Veesenmayer, a senior Waffen-SS officer, who was one of the main Nazis involved in plotting secret Nazi operations in Ireland. G2 made contact with British spies in Lisbon and Madrid and concluded that Kerney was in fact neutral. The Troubles in Northern Ireland G2 was involved throughout The Troubles (late 1960s to 1998), and Army officers were sent across the border into Northern Ireland on intelligence-gathering missions from 1969. In August 1969 Taoiseach Jack Lynch asked Irish Army Intelligence to draft proposals for a military intervention and guerilla operations in Northern Ireland in order to protect Irish nationalists there from sectarian attack from Ulster loyalist mobs, under a plan known as Exercise Armageddon. However it was deemed unworkable and was not adopted by the cabinet. Nationalist areas were later given a form of protection by British forces under Operation Banner. In 1970, the Arms Crisis and subsequent trial engulfed the state in a political scandal in which Irish Army intelligence officer Captain James Kelly was implicated in an unauthorised covert operation with the knowledge of Minister for Finance Charles Haughey and Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries Neil Blaney whereby £50,000 of a secret Irish government humanitarian fund of £100,000 (which had been set-up to help refugees fleeing Northern Ireland) was diverted and used to illegally import and smuggle arms and ammunition for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). The Garda Special Branch became aware of the unsanctioned operation and informed Minister for Justice Mícheál Ó Móráin and Taoiseach Lynch, who were slow to take action. Sensing this inaction, the Special Branch leaked the information to the press and the leader of the opposition Fine Gael leader Liam Cosgrave, who put pressure on Lynch to act. This resulted in Ministers Haughey (who later became Taoiseach) and Blaney being sacked from their posts, Captain Kelly was forced to resign, and the subsequent trial of all three in which the case collapsed and they were cleared of charges.CAIN – Chronology of the Conflict – 1970 — from the CAIN project at the University of Ulster. Cold War During the Cold War, G2 monitored communists and agents of communist governments operating in Ireland, primarily through embassies in Dublin, sharing information with western allies. Declassified intelligence files marked \\"Confidential\\" released at the end of 2019, after 30 years, show Irish government concerns over the possibility of British nuclear weapons in Northern Ireland. Colonel L Buckley, then Director of Intelligence briefed Peter Barry, then foreign minister, in November 1983 on the possibility of British/NATO nuclear missiles on the island of Ireland. Col Buckley believed nuclear weapons could be situated at underground facilities inside Benbradagh mountain in Derry, which US forces used as a communications hub in order to communicate with its North Atlantic fleet, but which were also designed for the storage of conventional high explosives. Col Buckley complained that he did not have \\"the monitoring or surveillance systems\\" to confirm the presence of nuclear weapons in Northern Ireland, but that the British strongly denied land-based systems in the territory and refused to confirm the movements of air and sea-based nuclear weapons. A separate file marked \\"Secret\\" from June 1985 shows that Irish military intelligence carried out reconnaissance on a British Army installation at Forkhill, Armagh (Northern Ireland) after it received information of \\"strong rumors\\" from locals that it was being converted into a nuclear facility. Their findings \\"strongly discounted the possibility\\". Materials had been brought into the base in night convoys but this was done for security reasons and it noted that there were underground facilities at Forkhill but that these were for accommodation and protection in the event of a mortar attack. Military intelligence did, however, have a reservation that Forkhill was \\"now on a microwave communications network which would have a Nato function in relation to possible nuclear attack”. J2 has been deployed numerous times alongside Irish forces on peacekeeping duties globally, mainly to ensure the safety and security of Irish troops, but also to provide intelligence on hostile forces. It is considered one of the most secretive intelligence agencies in Europe, and the Irish government and Defence Forces rarely allude to its very existence.  Operations   Foreign activities  Following the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, the Directorate of Military Intelligence significantly expanded their operations both internally and externally to provide the Irish government with a better intelligence picture in relation to terror threats emanating from al- Qaeda and affiliated groups, working with western partners. The 2004 Madrid train bombings (11-M) in Spain and 7 July 2005 London bombings in the United Kingdom also saw an increase in the budget and deployments of Irish intelligence officers. The service came to national and international attention in late 2005, when Arabic-speaking intelligence officers from the Directorate of Military Intelligence were deployed in Iraq, alongside heavily armed Irish Army Rangers, following the kidnapping of Irish journalist Rory Carroll in Baghdad by militants. Following the intervention of Irish, British and American governments, Rory Carroll was released unharmed days later and returned safely to Dublin. From 2006 to 2014, it has been reported that Military Intelligence and ARW Intelligence Section operatives were on the ground in; Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of various international missions. The Directorate receives intelligence reports from civil servants posted at Irish diplomatic missions overseas, via the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFA). Irish Military Intelligence works closely with the British Security Service (MI5) and Secret Intelligence Service (SIS/MI6), American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and National Security Agency (NSA), and is understood to have a relationship with Israeli Mossad. The Defence Forces and Garda Síochána provide security briefings to Department of Foreign Affairs employees and their families regarding potential terrorist attacks in host countries they are posted to. In May 2019, J2 was reported to have drawn up a plan to extract Lisa Smith - a former Irish Army soldier who converted to Islam before fleeing Ireland to join ISIS - and her two-year-old child from Syria by working with US military intelligence, who agreed to the plan. She would have been brought by Kurdish forces who had arrested her south to the Jordanian border by US military intelligence where Irish military intelligence would have escorted her back to Ireland. The plan was presented to the government by Minister Kehoe but was rejected by the government. There was reported to be significant dissatisfaction within J2 and the higher levels of the Defence Forces with the government's decision, as intelligence officers believed their experience put them in the best position to extract Smith and her child safely and quietly, rather than the DFA or Gardai. Later, in October 2019 it was reported the Army Ranger Wing had been deployed to the Syrian border in order to try and extract Smith and her child in a Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation after the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria resulted in Kurdish-held ISIS prisoners escaping, including Smith, although the Defence Forces did not confirm this. Domestic activities It has been alleged that Ireland facilitated the CIA's extraordinary rendition program of terrorism suspects in the aftermath of 9/11, including the secret detention and interrogation of suspects. It is claimed that Irish airports Casement Aerodrome (military) and Shannon International Airport (civilian) – used by the US military as stopover hubs – have been used by the CIA for rendition operations, with support from the Irish government. Military Intelligence and the Garda Special Detective Unit's Middle Eastern Desk are tasked with monitoring potential jihadists in Ireland and Irish citizens who fight abroad in warzones – specifically Syria and Iraq – for Muslim extremist organisations such as the self-proclaimed \\"Islamic State\\".  Electronic surveillance  CIS Corps have a signals intelligence role Ireland is not believed to engage in mass surveillance – as has been alleged in other western countries – however, it is reported to be a member of the ECHELON SIGINT (signals intelligence) network, sharing and receiving information with its members (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States). The Defence Forces CIS Corps is jointly responsible with the Military Intelligence Directorate for SIGINT and cyber operations within the Defence Forces. According to the Department of Defence: \\"The Defence Forces adheres to the provisions of all legislation regulating the conduct of intelligence gathering. The Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 does provide the Defence Forces with the authority to conduct intelligence-led operations involving surveillance, electronic communications and stored electronic information in order to safeguard and maintain the security of the State. The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 also provides for surveillance to be conducted by the Defence Forces in order to safeguard the security of the State.\\" The Directorate of Military Intelligence ceased the practice of providing transcripts of intercepts on mobile phone calls, landlines, texts and emails and other raw intelligence to the CIA in 2011/2012. It now provides information on Irish residents to foreign intelligence services through a mutual assistance programme instead. A warrant signed by the Minister for Defence or Minister for Justice is required to intercept a telephone call or email of an Irish citizen. J2 maintains a secured information technology network and a registry of classified documentation. All intelligence electronically transmitted to J2 from abroad comes via secured data links to the Army's Intelligence Comcen (Communications Centre), where messages are encrypted and electronically logged before being passed on for analysis. J2's computer systems are linked with the Garda CSB for the purpose of information share and cross-analysis. A report in late 2018 found that the Defence Forces had received 1,380 disclosures of communication data (mobile, landline and internet) based on requests to phone and internet firms over the five years 2013 to 2017 under the powers of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011. The Defence Forces can only seek data for state security - and averaging more than 5 requests per week - they were the next biggest user of such data after the Garda Síochána, ahead of the Revenue Commissioners and Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  Training and selection  Individuals can apply to be selected for the Directorate of Military Intelligence, and they must be Officers or NCOs to be considered for appointment. Unlike a number of similar military forces, the Irish Defence Forces actively include intelligence as part of Officer and NCO education, but those selected to join the Directorate receive further specialist training. The Defence Forces run their own Defence Intelligence & Security Course (DISC). The course runs for a number of months and covers the main areas of intelligence operations, including the principles of intelligence operations, defence intelligence, intelligence analysis, and combat intelligence. The course is supported by additional \\"on-the-job\\" training as part of the Directorate. This includes additional weapons, surveillance and communications training to support ongoing operations. Further training in languages is available, and specialist training on sensitive subjects such as religion, culture, ethnicity and radicalisation are also provided. Members of the Intelligence Branch may also receive further training with friendly forces overseas, such as in imagery intelligence. The Directorate of Military Intelligence consists of a high proportion of commissioned officers, most of whom will enter J2 with third level education, a Level 7 or Level 8 Bachelor's degree as per modern Defence Forces education standards and may go on to undertake further academic studies (such as a Level 9 Masters or higher) in a relevant field.

Southampton Academy, also known locally as \\"SA\\" provides education for students from pre-kindergarten through the 12th grade. Southampton Academy was founded in 1969, as a segregation academy.  Athletics  The school contains students ranging from pre- kindergarten through twelfth grade, thus the team offers athletic teams from the middle school level (junior junior varsity) to the varsity level. Most of Southampton Academy's athletic teams participate in the Virginia Commonwealth Conference (VCC). At the state level, Southampton Academy participates in Virginia Independent Schools (VIS) in Division III (smallest schools classification). From the schools founding in 1969 to 1991 the school played 11 man football in both the VAAC (precursor to the VCC) and the Virginia Commonwealth Conference. From 1991 to 2004, the school fielded eight-man football teams that participated in the Colonial Carolina Conference, a conference that plays in the North Carolina Independent Schools Athletic Association (NCISAA). The school was forced to play in North Carolina because there were none or few schools in Virginia that participated in 8-man football during this time period. While participating in the Colonial Carolina Conference, the Raiders won conference championships in 1995, 1996, and 1999. In 1997 and 2004, the Raiders won the NCISAA state championship. Southampton Academy finished its time playing 8-man football with another NCISAA championship in 2004. In 2005, the Raiders resumed playing 11-man football and reentered the Virginia Commonwealth Conference. Dale Marks has been the head football coach at Southampton Academy since 1991. Marks also enjoyed a coaching stint at Southampton Academy in the early 1980s which followed up his successful playing career at Hampden Sydney College. In 1995-1996, the girls teams at Southampton Academy finished a banner year in which they won VCC championships in girls basketball, volleyball, cheerleading, and softball. In 2007, the Raiders won the VIS Division III state baseball championship. In 2007, The Girls Varsity Basketball team won the VCC Conference and Tournament Championship. From 2000 through 2009 the Girl's Varsity Volleyball team won 10 consecutive regular season VCC Conference Championships as well as, 9 VCC Tournament Championships under the guidance of Head Coach Shawn Denne. During this period, the Raiders compiled a record of 202-13, finishing as state runners-up in 2006 while making 7 straight state tournament appearances.

Westermoen was involved in the companies Båtservice Verft, Westermoen Båtbyggeri og Mek. Verksted , Westermoen Hydrofoil and Westamarin , all situated in Mandal. On his own initiative, Westermoen started development of ahigh speed motor-torpedo vessel early in the 1950s. The prototype, Nasty was the start of the Tjeld class patrol boat that was put into production in 1957. The top speed was around 45 knots. Jan Herman Linge was the main designer for Westermoens from 1949 to 1956. The Nasty/Tjeld-class was in continuous production until 1970, and in addition to sales to the Norwegian navy, it was exported to Germany, Greece, Turkey and the United States. In the period 1965 to 1970, Westermoen Hydrofoil built 6 Storm class patrol boats. The Storm class we used as the basis for the Westamaran catamaran, which was essentially a Storm-class hull divided in the middle and separated to form a much wider catamaran, suited for passenger transport. The first generation Westamaran catamarans were not as quick as the competing hydrofoils, but their capacity was larger, maintenance easier, and they were more comfortable. The second generation catamarans, with symmetrical hulls, matched the hydrofoils in speed, reaching 35-40 knots. Toralf Westermoen was CEO in the various companies until 1969 when he was elected to the Norwegian parliament for Kristelig Folkeparti, where he served until 1981. The technology and heritage that Westermoen initiated, lives on in the company Umoe Mandal, who are building third generation catamaran craft that also includes SES-technology, such as the Skjold class patrol boats. His son Thore Westermoen also became involved in politics.

Originally built in 1958, the mall closed in 1997 and was demolished and redeveloped into Harundale Plaza, a shopping center anchored by HomeGoods and Regency Furniture.  History   Opening  The mall opened on October 1, 1958. Developed by Community Research & Development Inc, headed by James W. Rouse and designed by architectural firm Rogers, Taliaferro, & Lamb, the fully enclosed and air-conditioned center, which was constructed at a cost of $10 million, was described as the first one of its kind on the east coast. Built around an existing group of six stores on the property, the mall consisted of a total of 350,000 square feet, and featured fountains and plants throughout the mall. The primary \\"Garden Court\\" featured a 35-foot cage of \\"Mynah birds\\", along with a staircase leading to a balcony restaurant over top a fountain. Major retailers included department stores Hochschild, Kohn, & Co and Brager's, a large Oppenheim Collins branch, both S.S. Kresge and G. C. Murphy variety stores, and Food Fair. Grand opening ceremonies, beginning at 9 AM, featured Governor Theodore McKeldin, James W, Rouse, president of Hochschild, Kohn, & Co Martin Kohn, and various other politicians, including then senator John F. Kennedy. In 1959, Brager's would convert to the Brager-Gutman's name, with the two store's merger that year. A single screen theater, operated by General Cinemas, opened across from the mall in 1964. By 1971 the mall's Food Fair had also been converted to the new Pantry Pride name.  Missing persons  The mall was connected to two missing persons cases, in 1969 and 1970. Twenty-year-old Joyce Malecki was last seen at the Harundale Mall on November 11, 1969; she was found dead two days later at a shooting range in Fort Meade, Maryland. The next year, 16-year-old Pamela Conyers was last known as having driven to the Harundale Mall on October 16, before her body was found four days later in a wooded area, near what is now the Waterford Road/Maryland Route 648 overpass along Maryland Route 100.  Changes and decline  The mall's first renovation began on July 14, 1980. Done by Leblang & Associates, the $250,000 renovation consisted of a total repaint and re-tiling of the mall, in addition to a new \\"picnic area\\" in the south court, redesigned kiosks, and expanded planters and seating areas. The mall's Pantry Pride location was sold at auction in 1981 to E-Zee Markets, who went on to close the store in 1983. Hutzler's would acquire the Harundale Mall location of Hochschild, Kohn, & Co in 1984, with that location replacing their existing store at the Southdale Shopping Center. This location would become one of several announced to become \\"Hutzler's Value Way\\" in September 1988, before closing later that year. Value City took over the former Hutzler's space in 1989. The mall, then at 80% occupancy, was put up for sale by owner The Rouse Company in 1995. The next year, McCrory announced it would close its Harundale store once it reached the end of its lease in October, as part of wider store closures as a result of their 1992 bankruptcy. The mall quietly closed in 1997, with only two exterior tenants including Value City staying open. This was followed by the sale of the property to Manekin Corp, who announced plans to demolish the mall and redevelop the property into a strip mall.  Redevelopment as Harundale Plaza  By 1998 anchors for the strip mall had been announced, to include a Superfresh Supermarket and an expanded Value City, with both bank tenants at the former mall, First Union and Crestar, negotiating leases for new locations. Demolition began in March 1998, and was finished the next year. The final major store, AJWright, was announced in November 1999. Value City closed its doors in order to be converted to Burlington Coat Factory, as part of a deal reached by owner Retail Ventures Inc to sell leases of up to 24 stores, in 2008. AJWright would be converted to HomeGoods in February 2011, and later that year, Superfresh would close its doors. Regency Furniture would later open in that space.

Initially a Liberal Party member, in 2007 he became the party leader and the following year oversaw a merger with the National Party that produced the Liberal National Party. McArdle has held many parliamentary party positions, including stints as a Shadow Minister for Justice, State Development & Innovation; Emergency Services; Seniors; and Local Government. He has also served the Shadow Attorney General and the Parliamentary Liberal Party Whip. Political career  Member of Parliament  McArdle was first elected to Parliament at the 2004 Queensland State Election, succeeding former Deputy Premier Joan Sheldon.Mark McArdle Biography  Queensland Parliament In the 2006 Queensland election, McArdle was returned as the Member for Caloundra, taking a 2.6-point swing in his favour, and increasing his margin to 3.9%. Following electoral redistributions in 2008 prior to the 2009 state election, McArdle's margin was reduced to 1.9%. He was returned to Parliament again in the 2012 State Election. At the 2015 state election, Mark McArdle successfully defeated Labor candidate Jason Hunt to retain his state seat, despite a swing of over 20% against him. He was returned to his seat again, in the 2017 Queensland Elections. In June 2019 McArdle announced he would retire at the 2020 Queensland state election in October.  Ministerial Portfolios & Parliamentary Positions  McArdle served as the State Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party and the Deputy Opposition Leader, between 2007 and 2009. He was installed as a compromise candidate in the Leadership Contest of December 2007, after a deadlock between supporters of former leader Bruce Flegg and young challenger Tim Nicholls. He was made Deputy Leader of the Liberal National Party after the Queensland Liberal Party merged with the Queensland National Party. After the 2009 Queensland election, Mark McArdle vacated his position as Deputy Leader, as did Leader Lawrence Springborg. Days later, John-Paul Langbroek was elected Leader with Lawrence Springborg as Deputy Leader. Additional to his Parliamentary Party responsibilities, McArdle assumed the role of Shadow Minister for Health in August 2008, until the LNP's emphatic victory in 2012. Following the party leadership change, McArdle remained in his position as Shadow Minister for Health. After the Liberal National Party's landslide win in the 2012 Queensland state election, McArdle was appointed as Minister for Energy and Water Supply by Premier Campbell Newman, overseeing long-awaited and modernising reforms in energy and water security, after a series of natural disasters and an historical drought. In 2013, he revealed that he had prostate cancer, and took time off from his portfolio to battle the disease.  Party Involvement  McArdle has held many party positions as well, including as Chair of the Fisher Federal Divisional Council; Chair of the Fisher Business Branch; and as a Member of the State Executive of the then Liberal Party. LNP Queensland State MP Bio 2006 Election Controversy Prior to the 2006 Election, McArdle, by then an emerging force within the Parliament, came under sustained criticism from the Labor Party and local media for his role in the collapse of mortgage schemes run by Boyce Garrick Lawyers. Premier Peter Beattie claimed that his role in the collapse made him unfit for such a leadership position. McArdle responded by pointing out that he was cleared of any fault in the collapse by the Queensland Law Society in its investigation in 2001. He ultimately retained his seat. Activities McArdle takes an active role in the administration of his portfolio. He regularly attends relevant conferences and meets with key industry executives.

At its upper terminus, the funicular connects with what was the lower terminus of the Chemin de fer Glion-Rochers-de-Naye (GN) mountain railway, which opened in 1892. This later line was joined, in 1909, in an end on junction at Glion with the newly constructed Chemin de fer Montreux-Glion (MGl). History The line was opened in 1883, making it one of the oldest funiculars in Switzerland (the Giessbachbahn, opened in 1879, is the oldest). It was built to with two separate and adjacent tracks which spread apart to allow passing at the halfway point. The stations had two side platforms. In 1992 the company merged with Chemin de fer Montreux-Glion-Rochers-de-Naye, since 2001 they are part of Transports Montreux-Vevey-Riviera (MVR). Up to the mid-1980s the railway operated by gravity alone: Both cars had a water tank under their decks and the one at the upper station was filled with water while the one at the lower station (Territet) was dumping its contents in Lake Geneva (Lac Leman). Once the fill-dump process and passenger boarding were complete the brakes were gradually released and since both cars were attached by a single cable passing over a pulley arrangement at Glion, the heavier car descended the slope carrying up the lighter car. The process was then repeated so the car uphill was always filled and the one downhill always empty and thus pulled uphill when brakes were released. An added picturesque note was that the two car operators were communicating for synchronisation with whistles instead of an intercom or similar device. Eventually the system was abandoned and the train now uses electric traction. With rebuilding the line adapted the more conventional approach in which only a single track is used, the two rails opening at the halfway point to form a passing loop. One flanking (side) platform is in use at each station, however the second platform which was originally used can still be seen. The funicular was closed from 8 June to 2 October 2009 for maintenance work to be carried out and the two cars were taken to the MOB workshops at Chernex for attention and repainting in the new \\"Golden Pass\\" livery. A certain amount of rewiring was carried out along with a metal stairway on one side of the track (right hand side when going up) for the full length of the line being erected. Work was also carried out on the station shelters including a replacement roof. The two cars, originally painted in an all-over red livery, were built by Gangloff AG of Bern. In the 2009 repaint the cars were painted in a gold (lower portion) and white (upper portion) livery scheme and rebranded \\"Golden Pass\\". The new colours will be applied to the other funiculars in the Golden Pass Group as well as buses and trains, other than the Golden Pass Panoramic and Golden Pass Classic which they operate. Services The service, in each direction, commences at 05h25, then at 05h45 and every 15 minutes until 21h15, 21h45 and every 30 minutes until 23h15, 23h50, 00h20 and 00h45.

When Ari is fired in the episode \\"Exodus,\\" Lloyd is the only one who joins him on the way out and works for Ari's new agency in the third season. Over the course of the season, he continues to prove himself on the job, booking Drama's role in the new NBC series Five Towns. Ari eventually earns Lloyd's gratitude when he rescues Lloyd from a gay TV writer who wanted to take advantage of him and reunites him with his boyfriend after a breakup in the fourth season. Having spent years as Ari's assistant by the time of the sixth season, Lloyd tries to talk to him about a promotion. Ari makes him endure a series of challenges over 100 days, which proves so hard for Lloyd, that he leaves Ari to take up Adam Davies' offer to work at TMA. Ari responds in the episode \\"Berried Alive\\" by ensuring that nobody in Hollywood will work with Lloyd again, starting with his attempt to sign Drama as a client after he is taken off Five Towns. When the Miller-Gold Agency merges with TMA in the season 6 finale \\"Give A Little Bit,\\" Ari finally promotes Lloyd as an agent. Lloyd continues to work under him into the seventh season. In the final season, Ari makes Lloyd the interim chief of TMA's TV division upon the condition that he will task the Mad Men production staff to derail the audition of a waiter Ari mistakes as dating his wife. As Ari steps down from TMA in the series finale, Lloyd is surprised and confronts Ari for not letting him know early on, telling Ari that he was his inspiration. Ari exhorts Lloyd to continue working at TMA under Babs Miller. In the movie, Ari agrees to give away Lloyd at his wedding.

It is revealed in season 3 that the two first met at Harvard years before the events of the series and that she came from a rich Jewish family who left her a sizable trust fund (which Ari dips into to finance his new agency). In season 4, she receives a call from the producers of the soap opera The Young and the Restless to reprise her old role of Kendall Scott for a one-day comeback but turns down a full-time role to concentrate on raising her children. In season five, it is revealed that Melissa once featured in an erotic film that Ari tried to hide, but Adam Davies posted a picture from the film on the web. Mrs Ari has been shown to fully support her husband in his decisions through thick and thin, although in season 6, she is disgusted with Ari lying to her about Andrew Klein cheating on his wife Marlo (whom she had become close friends with). In the season 6 finale \\"Give A Little Bit,\\" Mrs Ari refuses to give Ari additional money to buy out the Terrance McQuewick Agency because of his admission of wanting to avenge his firing years before, but she is convinced to lend him the money for business reasons. The marital problems that built up in season 7 prompts Mrs Ari to separate from Ari and files for divorce while seeing Bobby Flay for most of the eighth season. However, Mrs Ari breaks up with Flay and reconciles with Ari in the series finale. Mrs. Ari is a recurring guest star in the first three seasons and a credited star in the intro of Season 4.

They broke up in the period between seasons 3 and 4 when E returns from the Medellin shoot and suddenly goes with the gang to Italy. Sloan reappears in the fifth season as E seeks her help in convincing Seth Green - who taunts E about his supposed past with her - to accept a role in a new show. Despite helping E lease one of her friends' houses to him in the sixth season and also land him a new job with her godfather, Sloan admits that she cannot get back with him unless they can really determine what they want from each other. A long fight on the road in the season 6 finale results in Sloan accepting E's marriage proposal.

(28 Episodes) Billy Walsh Making his debut in the Season 1 episode \\"The Scene,\\" Walsh is first hired by Vince to direct his upcoming movie, Queens Boulevard, on account of his triumph at the Sundance Film Festival with his indie movie Daze. He partially rewrites the script to include a scene in which Vince's character has a homosexual encounter. The boys worry over the scene, but Walsh persuades Vince of its viability as a test of his commitment to the project - by admitting that the scene will not be made at all. The team shoots the movie in New York during the interlude between Seasons 1 and 2. In season 2, Walsh aims for a second Sundance trophy by successfully submitting Queens Boulevard for exhibition, but defiantly insists that James Cameron - whom Vince wants to meet to firmly land the title role in Aquaman - watch it at the festival instead of sending him a print. The movie is eventually well received. In the third season, the studio prepares to release QB for a wider audience, but Walsh seeks an injunction because the general-release version would be colorized; it is implied that he was denied the injunction. Late in the season, the gang brings back Walsh - who is working as a porn film director - to direct the shooting of Medellin after he reads the script, knowing his ability to make quality films with small budgets. He agrees on the condition that he will have final cut. He later decides it will be shot in Spanish. In the fourth season, the gang goes down to Colombia to shoot Medellin. However, Walsh falls apart on the set over the course of the shoot, with some of his antics include banning cellphones during production meetings, violently firing a director of photography for poorly shooting a scene, conducting witch hunts to see who may have seduced a local woman (Sofia Vergara) hired for the shoot, and tapping Stephen Gaghan to help him rewrite the ending when he already revised it. Billy finishes filming the final scene of the movie, a military assault scene that he is pleased with. Walsh's conflicts in Colombia with E, whom he derisively calls \\"suit,\\" continue in Los Angeles for most of the season. Per his final cut authority, he avoids Vince and E from showing them the first cut and also refuses to consider editing it further after they see it. The Cannes Film Festival committee also accepts Medellin for screening, but not before Walsh gets angry at E for supposedly leaking the copy of a trailer (it is revealed that an editor's girlfriend did). Walsh hires Ari as his agent after Ari signs him, Vince and E to do a new movie, Lost in the Clouds. Knowing E's pledge to never work with Walsh again, Vince tries to get Walsh off the movie. Walsh fires Ari over a threat about being sued for breach of contract because he disposed the Lost in the Clouds script to make an entirely new script for a sci-fi film called Silo. Upon learning that Anna Faris is being managed by E, Walsh tries to get her aboard for the film, but she does not understand the script. He joins the gang in flying to Cannes for the Medellin premiere in the season finale \\"The Cannes Kids\\" but as with Cameron in Queens Boulevard, he refuses to let Yair Marx see the film. E's warnings about a failure to edit the film come back to haunt him as the audience jeers away at Medellin after the world premiere. It is implied that this failure has resulted in the cancellation of the Silo project and it effectively ends Walsh's movie career. Billy returns in the season 7 episode \\"Hair\\" looking to find work again to feed his family. He explains that he had spent the past two years reforming his ways - including being an ordained minister - and specifically approaches E for help. Over the rest of the season, Billy works with Drama to create a new animated series called Johnny's Bananas. In the final season, Walsh is temporarily rankled that Drama and Andrew Dice Clay's labor strike could cost him his job. He also steps in to fix Vince's miner movie script and to direct it as well. The final fate of the project is left unknown with the ending of the series. According to interviews on the season 2 DVD, the Billy character was inspired mainly by American television producer \\"Mad Skillz Tommy Schillz\\" Tom Schiller of Norwood, New Jersey.

Ari and Babs agrees to a 51/49 partnership in the new Miller-Gold Agency (MGA), where they must both agree on hiring or firing employees. They periodically get at odds with each other over various company issues during the next two seasons. In the fifth season, after she discovers Ari being offered the presidency of Warner Brothers, Babs tells Ari she will pay him ten cents per every dollar he invested in the agency. She also objects to Ari's plans to merge MGA with Andrew Klein's Klein-Cutler Talent Agency despite its profitability and clean finances. She eventually relents and agrees to the buyout as long as Ari will take care of Klein's wages. In season 6, Barbara wants to fire Klein after she sees him walking around the agency in his robe and threatens to do so unless he can sign Aaron Sorkin by the end of the day. Although Klein does land the job, Barbara begins to think less of him. In the seventh season, Babs works with Ari in dealing with the NFL and fallout from the disclosure of Lizzie Grant's blackmail. In the series finale, Ari lets her take over TMA as he resigns to spend time with his family.Babs: Jesus Christ Ari, this is a place of business. Ari: Not for me, not anymore.

Dana is accepted as an executive in another studio in the fourth season, where she clashes with Billy Walsh and Ari regarding the treatment of a script Walsh rewrote into an entirely new movie. She also avoids buying Medellin for distribution after the film's failure at the Cannes Film Festival. In the fifth season, Dana lands the presidency of Warner Brothers with Ari's help. The success of the maneuver results in Dana securing Vince for the film Smoke Jumpers, but issues with director Verner Vollstedt eventually lead to the project's cancellation despite Dana's attempts to get him in line. In Season 7, Dana is rebuffed by Ari over Vince's drug test ordered by Air-Walker director Randell Wallace, who later resigns and Peter Berg assumes the director's chair. Over the course of the series, various exchanges between Ari and Dana hint at a romantic and sexual relationship in the early 1990s. Ari also joked to Dana in the seventh season about she becoming the woman he would like to fool around with if he decides to cheat on Mrs. Ari. In the final season, it is revealed that the two were lovers until September 1992. At the time, Dana wanted to marry Ari, who broke up with her so he can marry who eventually became Mrs. Ari. The repercussions from Ari and Mrs. Ari's separation at the start of the eighth season prompts him to seek solace once again in Dana's arms. Both regretted walking away from each other years before and try to make their renewed relationship work, even as Mrs. Ari files for divorce. The attempts fail, especially after Dana encounters Ari's children at the TMA office. Ari and Dana finally part ways in the penultimate episode \\"Second to Last\\" when Ari states that despite them being good together and making Dana happy once again, he still loved his wife.

Scott later mocks Eric over a sexual encounter late in the season. In the seventh season, their rivalry escalates as Scott takes advantage of E's concerns with his wedding by luring Vince away from Eric with Air-Walker, a potential superhero franchise film. Despite agreeing to work together, the partnership sours as Scott is further marked as the catalyst of Vince's erratic behavior, although the partnership seems to have mended over time. As E learns of Murray's reporting to Terrance McQuewick about his work performance, Scott finally recruits him to aid in a takeover of the company, which is implied to have the support of the rank-and-file. It is also implied that while Scott likes Murray to his face, he secretly resents and despises the man because he's often absent from work. In the final season, Scott and E are busy handling operations at the new Murphy Lavin management agency. As a result, Scott tags along with the rest of the gang.

Over the rest of the story arc, Vollstedt admits he never wanted Vince to be part of the movie in the first place if not for Ari's deal with Dana Gordon, and even orders Turtle and Drama off the set. He fires Vince after shooting multiple takes of a critical scene without producing what he thinks is tangible results.

Description Wu Feng was a Han Chinese who befriended aborigines. According to the popular story about him, which was not recorded before 1855, he tried to persuade the A-li-shan tribe to give up their practice of headhunting, but his attempts were unsuccessful. On one occasion he declared that on the following day the aborigines would see a man in a red cloak. He told them they would cut off the man's head, but it would be the last head they ever took. The next day, the aborigines saw a man in a red cloak and decapitated him, only to find they had killed Wu Feng himself. Horrified, they gave up the practice of headhunting forever.劉家謀《海音詩》及其附文（咸豐五年，1855年） In the early 19th century, before 1820, a small mausoleum was built for Wu Feng. It was rebuilt and expanded in the early 20th century. This mausoleum is now a cultural landmark. This story was in school history books during the martial law period. In the 1970s, it was the subject of a long form modern dance piece, containing echoes of The Rite of Spring, by Cloud Gate Dance Theater. Some said it purports to show an example of the Han Chinese having a \\"civilising\\" influence on the Taiwanese aborigines through heroic personal sacrifice. During the Kuomintang rule of Taiwan, Wu Feng was considered a minor national hero. Reprinted 1995, SMC Publishing, Taipei. In 1989, soon after the 1987 lifting of martial law in Taiwan and taking advantage of a new-found emphasis on human rights, aborigines who had long been offended by their perception of racism in the Wu Feng story protested against its continued presence in history books. As part of the protest, they demolished statues of Wu Feng \\"wherever they found them.\\"\\"Minority, Not Minor.\\" Dignity, Respect & Freedom website:Government Information Office, Republic of China.

It was a loosely organised \\"cadre party\\" without mass membership. Its ideology was vague, including a broad diversity of different political convictions with descriptions ranging from left-wing via centrist to conservative. It was decidedly anti-communist and linked with the Paix et Liberté (\\"Peace and Liberty\\") movement. The UDSR was a founding member of the Liberal International in 1947.  Foundation  It was founded in 1945 by the non- Communist majority of the resistance network, Movement of National Liberation. The project was to create a French labour party with all the former non- Communist Resistance. However, this plan failed because of the rebirth of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and the emergence of the new Christian-Democratic party Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and then of the Gaullist party, Rally of the French People (RPF). Henceforth, the UDSR associated itself with the Radical Party, who had been in government during most of the Third Republic, in the Rally of the Republican Lefts (Rassemblement des gauches républicaines or RGR), which presented itself as an alternative to the tripartisme alliance between the SFIO, the MRP and the French Communist Party (PCF).  Fourth Republic  Following the May 1947 crisis during which Maurice Thorez, Communist vice-premier, and four other PCF ministers left Paul Ramadier's government, the UDSR took part in the Third Force coalition which gathered the centre-left and centre-right parties to face with the oppositions of the PCF on the one hand, and of the RPF on the other. It remained throughout the Fourth Republic a minor centrist political party which participated to the governments. Its president René Pleven was named president of the Council from 1951 to 1952, before being succeeded by Antoine Pinay (National Centre of Independents and Peasants, CNIP). But Pleven's leadership was eventually challenged by François Mitterrand who advocated a realignment to the Left, and took the lead in 1953. In 1956 the UDSR participated in the centre-left coalition Republican Front, headed by Pierre Mendès-France, which won the legislative election. However, two years later, the UDSR imploded. Indeed, Pleven and the conservative wing approved Charles de Gaulle's come back during the May 1958 crisis, in the midst of the Algerian War and threats of a coup d'état, and the institutions of the Fifth Republic, contrary to Mitterrand who called the new Constitution a \\"permanent coup d'état.\\"  Legacy  The UDSR survived until 1964, when it merged into Mitterrand's Convention of Republican Institutions (CIR), which itself merged at the 1971 Epinay Congress into the new Socialist Party (PS), which until 2017 was the main left-wing party in France.

The Grade I listed parish church of St Edmund is particularly noted for containing four Baroque marble monuments erected between the 1750s and 1830s to members of the local Montagu family of Boughton House. The monuments are housed in four niches in the specially constructed chancel. The original medieval (probably Norman) chancel was demolished to make way for its construction. The east window is large and of clear glass, flooding the chancel with light to show the white marble monuments at their best. Monuments to John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu (1690–1749), and his wife, Mary Churchill (1689–1752) are by the renowned sculptor Louis-François Roubiliac. A third monument to Mary Montagu (1711–1775), daughter of John and Mary, is by Pieter Mathias van Gelder (1742–1824). These first three monuments are of very high quality, rivalling the Roubilliacs in Westminster Abbey. The fourth monument, to Elizabeth Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch (1743–1827), daughter of Mary, is by Thomas Campbell (1790–1858) and, though very fine, is of significantly lesser quality than the other three. The private family burial vault, adjacent to the chancel, contains the mortal remains of those celebrated in the monuments, together with their children, many who died in infancy, and Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (1638–c. 1709).

The film tries to subjectively view schizophrenia and those who are affected by it. The film, Kerrigan's first feature, took about two years to completely finish shooting because he was constantly running out of money. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. The film was released on VHS in 1993, and for DVD on February 13, 2001.  Plot summary  The film begins with abstract images and sounds in the director's interpretation of schizophrenia. Peter Winter has recently been released from a mental institution and upon his release, must try to experience and understand a world that is all but foreign to him. Beginning the search for his daughter Nicole (Jennifer MacDonald), Peter's car is hit by a soccer ball. A young girl looks from beyond his windshield at him, and he gets out of the car. No actual images of the girl are shown after Peter exits his car, but the screams of a young girl are heard as if Peter is beating her. He carries a large orange bag into his trunk, and the audience is meant to presume that Peter killed this little girl. Winter returns home, where sounds invade his very being, and he is never completely at rest. He believes that there is a transmitter beneath the skin on his head and he proceeds to remove it. Peter is also disturbed by mirrors, and typically covers up any mirrors that he can access. The car that Peter drives becomes encased in newspaper, and he isolates himself from the outside world. Peter comes back home to find his mother Mrs. Winter (Megan Owen) still very disturbed about Peter's schizophrenia. She still treats Peter as a child, and does not want him to find his daughter. Peter, through his travels, becomes wrapped up in the investigation of the murder of another young girl. Jack McNally (Robert Albert), the detective on the case, is stymied because there is almost no evidence at the scene of the crime. Peter becomes a suspect in the case, but nothing found at the crime scene or in Peter's hotel room can link him to the murder. That does not stop the detective from following Peter after he kidnaps his daughter from her adoptive mother. Just as Peter begins to reconcile himself with his daughter, McNally shows up, desperate to take Peter in as the murderer. Peter foolishly takes out a gun and aims it at the police officer to try to protect his daughter from McNally. McNally, believing that what he is seeing is the dead body of Peter's daughter, opens fire on Peter, killing him. He finds the girl to be safe and fires Peter's gun in the air, so that he would not be charged for shooting a man unnecessarily. He then opens the orange bag and finds nothing but newspaper inside.

There's no conclusive evidence that he is and if people feel that he's guilty, I hope that the picture holds them responsible for drawing that conclusion.\\"  Response  Roger Ebert awarded the film with 3 and a half stars out of four and described it as a film for \\"anyone with a serious interest in schizophrenia or, for that matter, in film\\" and praised Greene's performance. The film enjoys a 90% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.78/10. The film has been cited as a favorite by filmmaker John Waters, who presented it as his annual selection within the 2000 Maryland Film Festival.

Peter and Paul The old church, although structurally sound, was in poor condition when Marcon, with the help of architect John Dando Sedding, decided to move the church. The new church was a reproduction of the old one, apart from the tower, using much of the masonry and fittings (such as the font, rood screen, pillars and windows) from the original, which stood a mile west. Consecration took place in 1885 and the tower was built in 1907-09, with a clock added in 1921. The Canon is remembered in the new church where he is depicted riding his bicycle in a window, which also commemorates the building of the church. This window was installed in the church in the 1980s. The 13th century tower from the old church still stands in a farmyard on the road to Hunworth. It is octagonal in shape and built from flint and carrstone. The remnants and tower of the old church were renovated with grants from English Heritage in 1981.

The village is north of North Walsham and south east of Cromer. It is north of the city of Norwich. Nearby road communications with Gimingham are the A140 to Norwich, the A148 (direct) and A149 (coast road) to King's Lynn, and the A149 into the Norfolk Broads and Great Yarmouth. The B1159 is a coastal road between Cromer and Mundesley. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. Early history Gimingham is in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name of Gimingeham. The manor was held by William de Warenne. The village name is thought to mean the ‘Ham’ or the ‘Homestead of Gymma’s people'. Gymma was the name of an Anglo-Saxon warlord who settled in this part of the country some time between the 5th and 6th century. The village name has appeared in several different versions. In 1192 it is documented as Gumingham whilst in 1211 it appears as Gemingehem. Gimingham Parish Church The Church Gimingham Parish Church is called All Saints. The church has been part of the Trunch group of parishes since 1965 and is in the service of a team of clergy of these parishes. There was an earlier church on the site of the present one. Signs of early Anglo-Saxon quoins can be seen in the east wall of the chancel. The chancel dates from the early 14th century. The church is almost entirely built from un-knapped flint although there are some squared flints in the entrance porch. Some buttresses and arches are of brick construction. The porch has two storeys and was incorporated into a much older original porch. The room on the first floor is known as a parvise. This room was used in the past by priests who had travelled some distance to get to the church. It also may have been used in the past as part of the wedding service, with guests waiting there while the groom and bride exchanged their vows in the porch. The nave dates from the 15th century and was re-roofed around 1950. The battlemented tower is also 15th century. Mill Pond and Water Mill The preserved Crossley diesel engine The River Mun pond A feature of the village is the mill pond which stretches along the western edge of the main street. The pond is home to many species of water fowl and is very popular with local fisherman. The mill pond is filled by the River Mun. The area beyond the river is said to have been part of the stew pond, the fish-breeding place of a small monastery. Close to the mill pond is the rebuilt corn mill. The original watermill burnt down during the night of 15 February 1979. A mill mentioned in the Domesday Book stood on this location. The one previous to the present building was built in the 18th century of flint, brick and pantiles. The pit for the original water wheel still remains, as does the old diesel engine, which provided power to the mill for many years.

Negative pledges often appear in security documents, where they operate to prohibit the person who is granting the security interest from creating any other security interests over the same property, which might compete with (or rank pari passu with) the security of the first secured creditor under the security document in which the negative pledge appears. In Australia, negative pledge lending took off after a substantial deal by Pioneer Concrete in 1978.Trevor Sykes, The Bold Riders, second edition, 1996, , pages 7-10 It was a new way of lending, which allowed the banks to lend to corporations, something previously the domain of life insurers. Negative pledge clauses are almost universal in modern unsecured commercial loan documents. The purpose is to ensure that a borrower, having taken out an unsecured loan, cannot subsequently take out another loan with a different lender, securing the subsequent loan on the specified assets. If the borrower could do this, the original lender would be disadvantaged because the subsequent lender would have first call on the assets in an event of default.

For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of Breckland.  History  Village sign for Caston Caston was the residence of Edward Gilman, a prosperous yeoman of Welsh descent, who died in 1573. Gilman's son Robert, born in 1559, later removed to Hingham, Norfolk, about five miles distant.Genealogy of the Gilman Family in England and America Traced in the Line of Hon. John Gilman of Exeter, Arthur Gilman, Published by J. Munsell, Albany, N.Y., 1864 His son Edward Gilman subsequently became caught up in the Puritan movement that swept parts of Norfolk, and moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in North America, to the town of Hingham, arriving there on 10 August 1638.Old Hingham Emigrants, hingham.org.uk Puritan sympathies apparently travelled in the family: Edward Gilman's sister Bridget, married to Edward Lincoln, had a son, Thomas Lincoln, who himself left Norfolk for Massachusetts in 1633 accompanied by Mary Gilman Jacob, another of Edward Gilman's sisters. Thomas Lincoln's brother Samuel followed him to Massachusetts in 1637, settling in Hingham alongside his brother. Samuel Lincoln became the great-great-great-great-grandfather of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States.Searches Into the History of the Gillman or Gilman Family, Alexander William Gillman, Eliot Stock, London, 1895 The Gilman family subsequently moved to Exeter, New Hampshire, where they became noted businessmen and statesmen. The family branch which remained in England subsequently produced two mayors of Norwich: Charles Suckling GilmanCharles Suckling Gilman was the son of Charles Gilman, Esq., of Norwich, and his wife Ann Suckling, niece of Capt. Maurice Suckling, RN, who first took to sea his nephew Horatio Nelson, later Lord Nelson. and his son, Sir Charles Rackham Gilman, who were both instrumental in the development of the insurance industry of Norwich and became philanthropists. Charles Rackham Gilman served as the first Chairman of Conservators of Mousehold Heath, which was donated to the City Council during Gilman's mayoralty. Gilman Road in Norwich is named for the family. Also descended from the Caston Gilmans was the prominent Norfolk barrister Samuel Heyhoe Le Neve Gilman, the grandson of a Hingham brewer and who practiced law at Hingham.The Record of the House of Gournay, Daniel Gurney, Printed by J.B. Nichols and J.G. Nichols, London, 1848 The remains of an elaborately carved cross believed to date from the 15th century are mounted atop a pillar on the Caston village green. The cross was smashed by Puritans during the Interregnum. Nearby is the Caston Windmill, a grade II* listed building built in 1864.

Islands are rare within the city and county of Waterford, although it is encircled by the River Suir and Kings Channel rather than the Atlantic Ocean. It is 420 acres in extent. Waterford city at night History According to tradition a Monastic settlement existed on the island sometime between the sixth and eighth centuries, and two \\"finds\\" on the land have lent substance to this: A Winged Angel dating from the 8th century and the crude carving of a Monk's head, dating from the 6th century. (The latter is now prominently displayed over the main entrance to the current castle.) During the Viking era, between the 9th and 11th centuries, the island was referred to as Dane's Island or Island Vra large number of Waterford yk. The Vikings built two fortifications guarding the river at the north and the south.waterfordcastle.com history The first family to live on the Island were the FitzGerald Family, who were cousins to Strongbow. They were awarded the land for their part in the Norman invasion of 1170. During the 15th and 16th centuries the FitzGeralds were Kings of Ireland in all but name and hosted many feasts and banquets on the island. Later the family took the name Purcell-Fitzgerald through marriage (see the two family emblems in the dining room). The first structure to be built on the island was a Norman keep. By the 15th century, the ruins of the keep were no longer habitable. A tower, the centre part of the present Castle, was then constructed on the site of the old keep. Initially it was relatively modest in size but over the years was enlarged, firstly in 1849 by John Fitzgerald and subsequently in 1875 and 1895 when the east and west wings were added. Built entirely out of stone, these additions are now indistinguishable from the older structure. The whole bears a strong resemblance to the Purcell castle at Loughmoe near Thurles. At that time, the island was also equipped with the latest in machine shop technology including lathes, grinding equipment, a 3ton overhead gantry, and so forth in the farm yard, This included a 110 V DC generator which was used to power the castle, the workshop, and the water pump (site of old windmill). Developments included a large arrangement of loose boxes and a dairy, forming the boundary to a large farm yard complete with a large two-story steward's house. These are still extant (summer 2014). The island and the castle having remained in the FitzGerald name for almost eight centuries, were sold 1966 to the Igoe family (Aberfoyle Plantations). They bought the property and installed a complex of glass houses from which they produced flowers for export. These included the very latest thinking in glasshouse technology at the time. They completely refurbished the castle and the cottages on the island - for example \\"Seaford\\" is located beside the jetty and the ferry-man lived there. In 1966, they employed a large number of Waterford people during construction and in operating the farm. The Igoes can be credited with saving the castle and bringing the Island up to date. Prior to the Igoe era, in 1956 John and Betty Williams came from Lough Ree near Athlone and took on the island from Princess Maria D'Ardia Caracciola on a lease arrangement. They ran a herd of 40 cows, shipping the milk across the river by prong every day to Gaultier Creamery, a very progressive coop at that time. They grew barley and wheat, which they brought by barge (M71) to the Mill in Waterford in the late winter time. Later on they grew potatoes and sold them in their shop \\"The Gourmet\\" which they started in Lombard street (1963-6) (extant summer 2014). All machinery was carried across the river in a \\"cattle boat\\", the remains of which can be seen lying on the mud just down-river from the landing place. In this time, they received great help from the Grant and Carslake families who lived and worked on the farm. Life on the island for all was tempered by having to face the river to get to school and bring back groceries and such like! From 1973 to 1974, the island served as one of the shooting locations for Stanley Kubrick's film Barry Lyndon. Much of this was shot in Ballinakill House, the home of Patsy Gossip and family. Ballinakill is also very significant in the Island's history. Michael Farren from Dublin, a horticultural engineer, renovated and developed the Island from 1974 to 1982. In 1982, the island was rented to a local pedigree dairy farmer, who later bought it. The castle became a luxury hotel in 1988 and the island became its grounds. Much of the land has since been converted into a golf course. The Igoe's The head of the family, Bill Igoe, was from Nenagh, while his forebears came from near Bonniconlon in County Mayo. He did however have investments in Rhodesia. He bought Little Island because of its horticultural potential, the Suir estuary having a micro climate with similar attributes to those of the Channel Islands. Access was by way of a \\"prong\\" or heavy rowing boat. with a very old barge powered by an ancient two stroke motor for moving crops and produce upstream to Waterford City. As time passed this was replaced first by a World War II DUKW (an amphibious two ton truck), then by another World War II vessel, a Landing Craft which could and did transport vehicles as large as oil tankers; and eventually by a purpose built chain ferry constructed by Verolme shipyards in Cork. Horticulture consisted of of modern glasshouses growing flowers for the export market, and outdoor crops such as salads, daffodils, raspberries and asparagus. During this period from 1965, some 30 people were employed on Little Island Today Little Island ferry Today the island, castle and grounds, continue to comprise a (19 bedroom) luxury hotel and golf course, Waterford Castle. The island is linked to the mainland by a private ferry which operates across Kings Channel between Ballinakill and the island's west side. The island is considered a significant site for bird watching. The main species are the grey heron (breeding), little egret, Eurasian wigeon, greenshank, common sandpiper and commoner waders, common kingfisher and Eurasian jay. In the 1950s/1960s the sloblands were home to large flocks of wild geese.

Matviyenko became the first female leader of Saint Petersburg.A journey from Saint Petersburg to Moscow RIAN Since the start of Matviyenko's service as governor, a significant share of taxation money was transferred from the federal budget to the local budget, and along with the booming economy and improving investment climate the standard of living significantly increased in the city, making income levels much closer to Moscow, and far above most other Russian federal subjects. The profile of Saint Petersburg in Russian politics has risen, marked by the transfer of the Constitutional Court of Russia from Moscow in 2008. Matviyenko developed a large number of megaprojects in housing and infrastructure, such as the construction of the Saint Petersburg Ring Road, including the Big Obukhovsky Bridge (the only non-draw bridge over the Neva River in the city), completion of the Saint Petersburg Dam aimed to put an end to the infamous Saint Petersburg floods, launching Line 5 of Saint Petersburg Metro, and starting land reclamation in the Neva Bay for the new Marine Facade of the city (the largest European waterfront development project)Marine facade Official website containing the Passenger Port of St. Petersburg. Several major auto-producing companies were drawn to Saint Petersburg or its vicinity, including Toyota, General Motors, Nissan, Hyundai Motor, Suzuki, Magna International, Scania, and MAN SE (all having plants in the Shushary industrial zone), thus turning the city into an important center of automotive industry in Russia, specializing in foreign brands. Another development of Matviyenko's governorship was tourism; by 2010 the number of tourists in Saint Petersburg doubled and reached 5.2 million, which placed the city among the top five tourist centers in Europe.Saint Petersburg expects 5 million tourists by the end of the year RIAN Some actions and practices of Governor Matviyenko have drawn significant criticisms from the Saint Petersburg public, the media, and opposition groups. In particular, new construction in already heavily built-up areas and several building projects were deemed to conflict with the classical architecture of the city, where the entire centre is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Some projects eventually were cancelled or modified, such as the controversial design of a 400-metre-tall Okhta Center skyscraper, planned to be built adjacent to the historical center of the city; however, after a public campaign and the personal involvement of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, it was relocated from Okhta to the Lakhta suburb. Another major point of criticism was Matviyenko's handling of the city's snow removal problems during the unusually cold and snowy winters of 2009–10 and 2010–11. On 22 August 2011, soon after completion of the Saint Petersburg Dam, Matviyenko resigned from office. As a member of the ruling United Russia Party, on 21 September 2011, Matviyenko was elected as Chairwoman of the Federation Council,Matviyenko takes Russian Upper House Speaker post RIAN the country's third-highest elected office. Early life Valentina Tyutina was born in Shepetivka in the Khmelnytskyi Oblast of Western Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. In 1972, Matviyenko graduated from Leningrad Institute of Chemistry and Pharmaceutics, where she met her husband, Vladimir Vasilyevich Matviyenko. They had a son, Sergey, in 1973. Matviyenko held various leadership positions within the Komsomol organization until 1984. Timeline of political career Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko signs joint documents in Greece on behalf of the Russian Federation while accompanying President Vladimir Putin. *In 1985 Valentina Matviyenko graduated from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Academy and became a party official in Leningrad's municipal government. In 1984–1986 she was the First Secretary of the Krasnogvardeysky District Committee of the Party. *Matviyenko was elected as a people's deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and headed the committee on women, family and children affairs. *Between 1991 and 1998 Matviyenko served in the diplomatic service and held several diplomatic positions including posts of Russian ambassador to Malta (1991–1995) and Greece (1997–1998). *On 24 September 1998, Matviyenko was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Russia for Welfare, and occupied this position until 2003. *In June 1999 she worked on the Board of Directors of the ORT TV channel. *Matvyenko was involved in a life-threatening car accident on 20 November 1999. *On 3 February 2000 she was nominated for the presidency, but refused to contest. On 29 February 2000, she announced that she was considering running in the St. Petersburg governor elections to be held on 14 May, and on 10 March announced that she was indeed launching her campaign. However, on 4 April she claimed that Vladimir Putin had asked her to withdraw from the elections, and she did so on 5 April. *On 11 March 2003 she left the Deputy PM position and was appointed presidential envoy to the Northwestern Federal District by Vladimir Putin.Presidential decree on appointing Valentina Matviyenko presidential envoy to the Northwestern Federal District Governor of Saint Petersburg Election French President Jacques Chirac, Chancellor of Germany Gerhard Schroeder and Valentina Matviyenko during the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg in 2003. On 24 June 2003, after Saint Petersburg governor Vladimir Yakovlev resigned ahead of schedule, Matviyenko announced that she was ready to run for governor. Her nomination was supported by the United Russia political party and President Vladimir Putin. Putin publicly supported her candidacy on 2 September in a meeting that was broadcast by two state-owned TV stations. Previously, at the end of June, the new management of local channel St. Petersburg Television shut down a range of analytical programmes on local politics, which was thought to be one of the factors in elections outcome. In the first round of elections held on 21 September 2003, Matviyenko came first with 48.61% of the vote, followed by Anna Markova, a former member of Yakovlev's staff, with 15.89%. 10.97 percent of the electorate voted against all nine nominees. Turnout was low at just 29%. On 5 October 2003 Matviyenko won the second round with 63 percent (vs. 24% for Anna Markova) and was elected governor of Saint Petersburg, the head of the Saint Petersburg City Administration. She became the first female head of government of Saint Petersburg. Confirmation in office Vladimir Putin and Valentina Matviyenko in 2008. In 2005 a new Russian federal law came into force whereby governors are proposed by the President of Russia and approved or disapproved by regional legislative assemblies rather than elected by direct popular vote. On 6 December 2006, one year before her term as elected governor would expire, Valentina Matviyenko asked Vladimir Putin to nominate her for approval according to the new legislation, and he agreed. She was approved by the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly on 22 December 2006. Public protests On 3 March 2007, scores of participants of the Dissenters' March, organized by marginal opposition parties, demonstrated in the city's main avenue, Nevsky Prospekt, calling for governor Matviyenko's dismissal. She in turn accused them of stirring up trouble ahead of elections to the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly scheduled for 11 March, of criticising the city's perceived dynamic development and for allegedly receiving financial support from dubious sources. On 15 April 2007, the Dissenters' March took place in Saint Petersburg for the second time. Assassination attempt On 19 May 2007, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation announced that on 16 May it had detained several members of an undisclosed youth religious group allegedly preparing an assassination attempt on Valentina Matviyenko's life using hand grenades and plastic explosive. On 23 May FSB Director Nikolay Patrushev announced that the prevented attempt had been scheduled for June. City development =Budget and incomes= The Saint Petersburg Dam was completed when Matviyenko was in office. The dam is the last part of the Saint Petersburg Ring Road, with the longest sub-sea tunnel in Russia going below the dam's largest lock. Matviyenko electoral promises included the transfer of a significant share of taxation money from the federal budget to the local one, which was supported by President Putin, a native of Saint Petersburg. Along with the booming economy and improving investment climate this allowed to significantly improve the standard of living in the city, making income levels much closer to Moscow and high above most other Russian federal subjects. =Political profile= New governor pledged her support for the idea of transferring some part of the capital's functions from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. The role of Saint Petersburg in Russian politics has risen, marked by the transfer of the Constitutional Court of Russia from Moscow in 2008. The city's main television broadcast, Petersburg – Channel 5, in October 2006 was licensed to broadcast nationwide again.Channel 5 Official Website. About company The 32nd summit of G8 countries were held in Saint Petersburg from 15 to 17 July 2006. St. Petersburg International Economic Forum continued to grow in popularity and attendance in the late 2000s. =Infrastructure= The construction of the Saint Petersburg Metro gained pace under Matviyenko. (Obvodny Kanal, the newest station, is shown). Matviyenko developed a large number of megaprojects in housing and infrastructure, such as building of the Saint Petersburg Ring Road including the Big Obukhovsky Bridge (the only non- draw bridge over the Neva River in the city), completion of the Saint Petersburg Dam aimed to put an end to ill-famous Saint Petersburg floods, launching Line 5 of Saint Petersburg Metro and starting land reclamation in the Neva Bay for the new Marine Facade of the city (the largest European waterfront development project) containing the Passenger Port of St. Petersburg. =Industry= Several major auto-producing companies were drawn to Saint Petersburg or its vicinity, including Toyota, General Motors, Nissan, Hyundai Motor, Suzuki, Magna International, Scania and MAN SE (all having plants in Shushary industrial zone), thus turning the city into an important center of automotive industry in Russia, specializing on foreign brands. =Tourism= Scarlet Sails, rose to a new scale under Matviyenko and began to be broadcast nationwide. The city administration launched a number of programs aimed to increase the number of tourist arrivals (such as advertisement campaigns abroad) and to improve the tourist infrastructure in the city, including the construction of new hotels. Between 2003–2010 the number of tourists in Saint Petersburg doubled and reached 5.2 million, which placed the city among the top 5 tourist centers in Europe. =Culture= The June celebration of the graduation from school, the Scarlet Sails (a part of the White Nights Festival), rose to a new scale under Matviyenko and began to be broadcast nationwide on Petersburg – Channel 5. The Saint Petersburg Carnivals on the day of the city, 27 May, also became much grander. Criticism =Controversial construction projects= A collage showing how the controversial Okhta Center skyscraper would look beside the historic Smolny Cathedral by Bartolomeo Rastrelli. The new construction in already heavily built-up areas was a point of continuous criticism during Matviyenko's governorship. Of especial note were a number of building projects deemed by many experts and conservative public to contradict the classical architecture of the city where the entire centre is UNESCO World Heritage site. Matviyenko supported the construction project of the Gazprom City business center (also called Okhta Center) including a 400-meter skyscraper holding the headquarters of some of Gazprom's subsidiaries on the right bank of the Neva River in the vicinity of the historic Smolny Cathedral. The current regulations forbidding construction buildings of more than 42 meters (48 with expert approval) were specially changed by the city administration for the project. By the end of her governor service, Matviyenko more eagerly engaged in dialogue with the groups of the so-called gradozaschitniki (градозащитники, \\"city-defenders\\"). A number of controversial projects eventually were cancelled or modified. Notably, after an extensive public protest campaign, which lasted several years, and after the personal involvement of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the Okhta Center was relocated from Okhta to Lakhta suburb. Other controversial projects include the Mariinsky Theatre Second Stage and the reconstruction of the New Holland Island. Both projects required destruction of some of the earlier historic buildings, and the new stage of the Mariinsky Theatre was originally attempted to be built according to a highly original design by French architect Dominique Perrault, resembling a cocoon. The project, however, was deemed too costly and too much out-of-line with the surrounding classical architecture, and the design was changed. =Snow cleaning problems= Matviyenko's handling of the cleaning of the city from snow during the unusually cold and snowy winters of 2009–2010 and 2010–2011, in the last two years of her governorship, drew criticism, especially from the automobile owners and drivers in the city. The authorities were unprepared for vast amounts of snow on the city streets, especially in the historical centre, and there was a lack of snow cleaning equipment.Saint Petersburg needs 5000 units of snow-cleaning equipment - Oksana Dmitrieva =Accusations of corporate raiding= Businessman Vitaly Arkhangelsky accused Matviyenko of corporate raiding and corruption. According to him, Matvieyenko is the real owner of the Bank Saint Petersburg that staged a corporate raid on the property of his company, OMG that included Vyborg Port and Western Terminal of Saint Petersburg port using falsified documents with Arkhangelsy's forged signature. The lawyers of Bank Saint Petersburg insist on exclusion materials of Matviyenko's involvement from the criminal case in London court.

She was backed by President Dmitry Medvedev as a candidate to head the Federal Assembly or Upper House of the Russian Federation. The previous speaker of the Federation Council, Sergey Mironov, was recalled in May after criticising Matviyenko's handling of Saint Petersburg. The leader of A Just Russia party, Mironov was ousted by the majority United Russia and replaced by an acting speaker Alexander Torshin. As a member of United Russia party, Matviyenko stood in a municipal election in August in order to have legal possibilities to attain the office in the Federation Council.

It began operating motorbuses in 1912, and became a limited company on 26 October 1986 due to the Transport Act 1985. Southend Transport was involved in a price war with Thamesway (now part of First Essex). Southend Transport was sold by Southend Borough Council to the British Bus group in June 1993 for a reported £1, which in turn was taken over by the Cowie group. Cowie was renamed Arriva in August 1998 and Southend Transport was renamed Arriva serving Southend as part of this rebranding. Although the 'serving Southend' local identity caption has now been phased out, it can still be seen on the sides of some of their buses. On 28 January 2000, the original Southend garage at 87 London Road dating from the foundation of Southend Corporation Transport was closed and demolished shortly afterwards, with a new one constructed in Short Street, Southend-on-Sea. The old London Road site is now occupied by a retail park. Arriva Southend had continued the service X1 coach service to London inherited from Southend Transport, latterly as the Green Line 721 service. In 2001 operation of route X1 was taken over by Stephensons of Essex, which withdrew it in July 2008. A restructuring in 2002 saw overall control of Arriva Colchester and Arriva Southend pass to Arriva Southern Counties from Arriva East Herts & Essex. On 30 March 2008 both commercially run services from the Grays garage (routes 373 and 383) were withdrawn, with the buses used for these services moving to Southend garage. The Grays garage now only operates the Transport for London (TfL) contracted services. Criticisms Arriva Southend has been criticised by users and the Southend Area Bus Users' Group for withdrawing services which it considered no longer economically viable due to low passenger numbers (even when parts of the route were profitable) when Southend Borough Council withdrew bus subsidies of up to £6 per passenger in 2005. On 21 January 2008 Southend Area Bus Users' Group and Councilor Steve Aylen successfully campaigned for improvements to Service 6A after having been withdrawn in 2005. On 31 March 2008, service 7 was extended at the suggestion of Great Wakering Parish Council and the Rochford Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership, who are subsidising the service. The company trials the operation of new services to gauge service demand, and makes services permanent if there are enough passengers to support them being run. It has also been criticised by Southend Borough Council for the age of its bus fleet, as some of its buses are nearly 20 years old and many do not have low-floor, easy-access step-free entry which is important for older people, as Southend has an ageing population with the most senior citizens in the country, although most areas do not have full low-floor networks yet, and buses are built to have working lives of about 20 years. Arriva Southend did introduce some new Dennis Trident 2 Alexander ALX400 low-floor double-decker buses branded for use on services 7 and 8 in 2000, but they were subsequently redistributed to Arriva Maidstone and Arriva East Herts & Essex in 2004/5 as Arriva decided that they were not getting enough passengers to justify their use. However, many of the older buses have now been replaced with more modern ones, and this process will continue over the next year to replace the remainder of the older vehicles. Further criticism came from passengers when Arriva Southend and First Essex decided to withdraw their \\"Day Rover\\" ticket, which allowed unlimited journeys on the day of purchase on buses operated by both companies regardless of which company issued the ticket, so day tickets can now only be used on the buses of the company issuing them. They replaced it with a more expensive \\"Octopus\\" ticket which is issued by and can be used on any buses operated by Arriva Southend, First Essex, NIBS, Regal Busways and Stephensons of Essex in the Southend, Rochford and Castle Point districts, covering more bus operators and a wider area of Essex. On 8 February 2009, Arriva reduced the frequency of services 7 and 8 to some areas, which angered some residents in Hockley and Hawkwell, as it made it very difficult for them to get to and from Southend Hospital and Clements Hall Leisure Centre on time due to the 7 and 8 either running very late in the Shoebury area, or buses turning back before reaching their terminating point. The move also dismayed Rochford councillors. The Hockley Residents' Association also said that the figures for low customer numbers used to justify the frequency reduction were flawed. After receiving numerous complaints from Hockley residents, on 7 June 2009 Arriva Southend extended some service 7 buses to Hockley Spa instead of terminating at Ashingdon Schools. It is likely that this extra service is now going to stay after a review in December 2009. Hawkwell residents then sent further complaints to the Essex County Council about service 8 not having evening services after 6:30pm since 2002. They demanded that one of the service 7 evening buses to become an 8 and divert to Hawkwell. Essex County Council said it would not be possible to add an evening service to service 8. Arriva Southend have also been criticised for running all of their services in the Shoeburyness area via Asda, after they changed the route of Service 1 to run through Asda instead of Elm Road. Arriva Southend has started using an \\"undercover passenger\\" scheme to attempt to better understand problems and complaints with the changes they have made to their services, encouraging passengers to participate by offering them a week's free bus travel for rating the services they use. There has been crictism from passengers frequently using Service 29, which was merged with Service 13 to provide a through service from Belfairs to Temple Sutton since 27 March 2011. The route merger resulted in drivers not given sufficient time to complete the whole route, which has caused buses to turn back before reaching their terminating point, missing out certain bus stops and leaving passengers stranded from over 45 to 90 minutes to wait for the next Service 29. Service branding From September 2010, the main services have been colour-coded on route maps, with Service 1 dark green, Service 4 red, Service 4A light blue, Service 5 maroon, Service 6A lilac, Service 7 orange, Service 8 light green, Service 9 light pink, Service 10 dashed grey, Service 13 dark pink, Service 17 dashed dark blue, Service 18 dashed dark purple, and Service 29 sea green. In 2008, Arriva Southend began branding some of its low-floor Dennis Dart buses for specific services with red and yellow vinyl stickers, beginning with Service 29 as \\"the twenty-nine\\", then Service 13 as \\"…the sutton shuttle…\\" and Service 5 as \\"Basildon direct\\", with associated dedicated web sites for the 5 and 29. Some buses had previously been colour-coded, with Service 1 red, Service 5 dark blue and Service 9 light green. This colour-coding was retained on the timetables for these services, with Service 13 and 29 dark green, and Service 17 purple, until the new colour codes replaced them. The four Service 29 branded Darts were named by students at the Fairways Primary School in Belfairs in conjunction with the launch of the branding. Service 5 branding has now been removed following the withdrawal of services to Grays and Lakeside. Services 13 and 29 have now had their branding removed, as they have been combined from Monday 28 March 2011, with Service 29 being extended to Temple Sutton to replace Service 13. Service 9 was branded \\"The Wave\\" and supplied with new, named, buses in November 2011. In 2013, route 1 also received new, branded buses, each named after a place that the route serves, e.g. 'Pride of Rayleigh' or 'Pride of Southend'.

It has been specified by the European Broadcasting Union. It has been accepted as the ITU recommendation ITU-R BS.2088. The file format is designed to meet the requirements for multichannel sound in broadcasting and audio archiving. It is based on the Microsoft RIFF/WAVE format and Wave Format Extensible for multichannel parameters. Additions are made to the basic specification to allow for more than 4 GB file sizes when needed (the new maximum filesize is now approximately 16 exabytes). The format is transparent to the BWF and all its supplements and chunks. RF64 WAV files typically use the .wav file extension.  Capability  A maximum of 18 surround channels, stereo down mix channel and bit stream signals with non-PCM coded data can also be stored in the file format. RF64 can be used in the entire programme chain from capture to editing and play out and for short or long term archiving of multichannel files. Due to the inconsistent usage of CUE data definition, the additional requirement that CUE chunk names be stored in an additional LABL chunk, along with the inherent 32-bit limitation of the CUE chunk pointer index, the 2009 RF64 format also defines a new 'r64m' marker chunk. The RF64 file format should fulfill the longer-term need for multichannel sound in broadcasting and archiving. The required effort for software implementers is very small. The changes that will be needed to update existing systems will be reasonable in cost.  Format  In its basic form, the 32-bit chunk size field at offset 4 in the file is set to \`-1\` (\`0xFFFFFFFF\`), and immediately following that a new 'ds64' chunk is inserted (before the FMT chunk). This new ds64 chunk will contain the 64-bit sizes of the DATA chunk(s), using a simple sequential table mechanism to point to additional DATA chunks. The first 4 bytes of the file are then changed from 'RIFF' to 'BW64'. RF64 files define the following extra chunks: * BW64, replaces \\"RIFF\\" * ds64, data size 64, first chunk under BW64 * axml, from BWF * bxml, like \\"axml\\" in BWF (ITU-R BS.1352-3), but compressed * sxml, sound- related XML data * chna, channel info * JUNK, a placeholder for ds54 An RF64 file with a 'bext' chunk becomes an MBWF-file.

Such insertional mutations can occur naturally, mediated by viruses or transposons, or can be artificially created for research purposes in the lab.  Signature tagged mutagenesis  This is a technique used to study the function of genes. A transposon such as the P element of Drosophila melanogaster is allowed to integrate at random locations in the genome of the organism being studied. Mutants generated by this method are then screened for any unusual phenotypes. If such a phenotype is found then it can be assumed that the insertion has caused the gene relating to the usual phenotype to be inactivated. Because the sequence of the transposon is known, the gene can be identified, either by sequencing the whole genome and searching for the sequence, or using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify specifically that gene.  Virus insertional mutagenesis  Because many viruses integrate their own genomes into the genomes of their host cells in order to replicate, mutagenesis caused by viral infections is a fairly common occurrence. Not all integrating viruses cause insertional mutagenesis, however. Some DNA insertions will lead to no noticeable mutation. In recent gene therapy trials, the lentiviral vectors used to insert therapeutic DNA showed no tendency to disrupt gene function or promote oncogenic development.Biffi A, et al., Lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy benefits metachromatic leukodystrophy. Science. 2013 Aug 23;341(6148):1233158.Aiuti A, et al. Lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Science. 2013 Aug 23;341(6148):1233151 Because of these advances, it is now considered safe to use such integrating vectors for gene therapy. An advantage is that the lentiviral vectors integrate the DNA permanently, whereas other, non- integrating, viruses' effect is transient. For those viruses such as gammaretroviruses that tend to integrate their DNA in genetically unfavorable locations, the severity of any ensuing mutation depends entirely on the location within the host's genome wherein the viral DNA is inserted. If the DNA is inserted into the middle of an essential gene, the effects on the cell will be drastic. Additionally, insertion into a gene's promoter region can have equally drastic effects. Likewise, if the viral DNA is inserted into a repressor, the promoter's corresponding gene may be over-expressed – leading to an overabundance of its product and altered cellular activity. If the DNA is inserted into a gene's enhancer region, the gene may be under-expressed – leading to relative absence of its product, which can significantly interrupt the activity of the cell. Alteration of different genes will have varying effects on the cell. Not all mutations will significantly affect the proliferation of the cell. However, if the insertion occurs in an essential gene or a gene that is involved in cellular replication or programmed cell death, the insertion may compromise the viability of the cell or even cause the cell to replicate interminably – leading to the formation of a tumor, which may become cancerous. Insertional mutagenesis is possible whether the virus is of the self-inactivating types commonly used in gene therapy or competent to replicate. The virus inserts a gene (known as a viral oncogene) normally near the cellular myc (c-myc)gene. The c-myc gene is normally turned off in the cell; however when it is turned on it is able to push the cell into the G1 phase of the cell cycle and cause the cell to begin replication, causing unchecked cell proliferation while allowing the viral gene to be replicated. After many replications where the viral gene stays latent tumours begin to grow. These tumours are normally derived from one mutated/transformed cell (clonal in origin). Avian leukosis virus is an example of a virus that causes a disease by insertional mutagenesis. Newly hatched chicks infected with Avian leukosis virus will begin to form tumours that will begin to appear in their bursa of fabricus (like the human thymus). This viral gene insertion is also known as a promoter insertion as it drives the expression of the c-myc gene. There is an example of an insertional mutagenesis event caused by a retrotransposon in the human genome where it causes Fukuyama-type muscular dystrophy. Insertional inactivation Insertional inactivation is a technique used in recombinant DNA engineering where a plasmid (such as pBR322) is used to disable expression of a gene. The inactivation of a gene by inserting a fragment of DNA into the middle of its coding sequence. Any future products from the inactivated gene will not work because of the extra codes added to it. An example is the use of pBR322, which has genes that respectively encode polypeptides that confer resistance to ampicillin and tetracyclin antibiotics. Hence, when a genetic region is interrupted by integration of pBR322, the gene function is lost but new gene function (resistance to specific antibiotics) is gained. An alternative strategy for insertional mutagenesis has been used in vertebrate animals to find genes that cause cancer. In this case a transposon, e.g. Sleeping Beauty, is designed to interrupt a gene in such a way that it causes maximal genetic havoc. Specifically, the transposon contains signals to truncate expression of an interrupted gene at the site of the insertion and then restart expression of a second truncated gene. This method has been used to identify oncogenes.

He performed in a variety of Latin music genres, including Latin pop, Latin jazz, Brazilian pop and easy pop. The son of a classical violinist and a ballet instructor, Slon was raised in São Paulo and began recording professionally at an early age, taking first place in a national poll of jazz critics while still a teenager. He performed alongside his father in the São Paulo Philharmonic, before appearing with the Walter Wanderley Trio, as well as Sérgio Mendes' Brasil '66 and Brasil ‘77 during the 1960s and 1970s. He also appeared on many Brazilian sessions overseen by Creed Taylor for the Verve label, including A Certain Smile, A Certain Sadness by Astrud Gilberto and The Walter Wanderley Trio, Wave by Antônio Carlos Jobim, and Samba '68 by Marcos Valle. Although a total of three drummers are generally credited on the Jobim Wave release and reissues, it is Slon who is playing the drum set; Bobby Rosengarden and Dom Um Romao play only percussion on the record. The success of the Wanderley Trio's Top Five single \\"Summer Samba\\" and platinum debut album Rain Forest brought recording work of all kinds for Slon during the period, including a high-profile gig with Jobim and Frank Sinatra on the album Sinatra & Company and its accompanying television special A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim. He joined Sérgio Mendes & Brasil '66 by the end of the decade. Slon appeared with the group for a total of nine years, and has also played and recorded albums with Dori Caymmi, Paulinho da Costa, John Pisano and Joe Pass, among others. Slon also co-led (with Milcho Leviev) the Leviev-Slon Quartet, releasing albums for Vartan Jazz (Jive Sambas, among others) and then for Elephant Records (“When I'm 64”), the latter recorded with Herbie Mann. The last Trio of which he was the drummer was the newly formed Joao Donato Trio in 1999, where that group recorded three albums on Elephant. In addition to being a top-notch drummer, Claudio was also an excellent Brazilian percussionist and recorded as such on several albums. Slon was based in Los Angeles for many years before relocating in the mid-1990s to Colorado where he continued to work as a drummer, percussionist and producer until his death from lung cancer in Denver, Colorado, in April, 2002.

GDL describes the state of a game as a series of facts, and the game mechanics as logical rules. GDL is hereby one of alternative representations for game theoretic problems. Purpose of GDL Quoted in an article in New Scientist, Genesereth pointed out that although Deep Blue is able to play chess at a grandmaster level, it is incapable of playing checkers at all because it is a specialized game player. Both chess and checkers can be described in GDL. This enables general game players to be built that can play both of these games and any other game that can be described using GDL. Specification  Syntax  GDL is a variant of Datalog, and the syntax is largely the same. It is usually given in prefix notation. Variables begin with \\"\`?\`\\".  Keywords  The following is the list of keywords in GDL, along with brief descriptions of their functions: ;\`distinct\` :This predicate is used to require that two terms be syntactically different. ;\`does\` :The predicate \`does(?r,?m)\` means that player (or role) \`?r\` makes move \`?m\` in the current game state. ;\`goal\` :The predicate \`goal(?r,?n)\` is used to define goal value \`?n\` (usually a natural number between 0 and 100) for role \`?r\` in the current state. ;\`init\` :This predicate refers to a true fact about the initial game state. ;\`legal\` :The predicate \`legal(?r,?m)\` means that \`?m\` is a legal move for role \`?r\` in the current state. ;\`next\` :This predicate refers to a true fact about the next game state. ;\`role\` :This predicate is used to add the name of a player. ;\`terminal\` :This predicate means that the current state is terminal. ;\`true\` :This predicate refers to a true fact about the current game state.  Rules  A game description in GDL provides complete rules for each of the following elements of a game. = Players = Facts that define the roles in a game. The following example is from a GDL description of the two-player game Tic-tac-toe: (role xplayer) (role oplayer) = Initial state = Rules that entail all facts about the initial game state. An example is: (init (cell 1 1 blank)) ... (init (cell 3 3 blank)) (init (control xplayer)) = Legal moves = Rules that describe each move by the conditions on the current position under which it can be taken by a player. An example is: (<= (legal ?player (mark ?m ?n)) (true (cell ?m ?n blank)) (true (control ?player))) = Game state update = Rules that describe all facts about the next state relative to the current state and the moves taken by the players. An example is: (<= (next (cell ?m ?n x)) (does xplayer (mark ?m ?n))) (<= (next (cell ?m ?n o)) (does oplayer (mark ?m ?n))) = Termination = Rules that describe the conditions under which the current state is a terminal one. An example is: (<= terminal (line x)) (<= terminal (line o)) (<= terminal not boardopen) = Goal states = The goal values for each player in a terminal state. An example is: (<= (goal xplayer 100) (line x)) (<= (goal oplayer 0) (line x)) Extensions GDL-II With GDL, one can describe finite games with an arbitrary numbers of players. However, GDL cannot describe games which contain an element of chance (for example, rolling dice) or games where players have incomplete information about the current state of the game (for example, in many card games the opponents' cards are not visible). GDL-II, the Game Description Language for Incomplete Information Games, extends GDL by two keywords that allow for the description of elements of chance and incomplete information: ;\`sees\` :The predicate \`sees(?r,?p)\` means that role \`?r\` perceives \`?p\` in the next game state. ;\`random\` :This constant refers to a pre-defined player who chooses moves randomly. The following is an example from a GDL-II description of the card game Texas hold 'em: (<= (sees ?player ?card) (does random (deal_face_down ?player ?card))) (<= (sees ?r ?card) (role ?r) (does random (deal_river ?card))) GDL-III Michael Thielscher also created a further extension, GDL-III, a general game description language with imperfect information and introspection, that supports the specification of epistemic games — ones characterised by rules that depend on the knowledge of players. Applications A 2016 paper \\"describes a multilevel algorithm compiling a general game description in GDL into an optimized reasoner in a low level language\\". A 2017 paper uses GDL to model the process of mediating a resolution to a dispute between two parties, and presented an algorithm that uses available information efficiently to do so.

Located on the French Riviera (Côte d'Azur), west from Nice and east from Marseille, it had a population of 13,968 in 2017. Its inhabitants are called Maximois or Maximoises in French. Geography The town faces southward on the northern shore of the Gulf of Saint-Tropez. In the north the Massif des Maures mountain range protects it from the cold winds of the mistral. It is the seat of the canton of Sainte-Maxime. History Early history Le goûter sur la terrasse à Sainte-Maxime by Henri Lebasque Sainte-Maxime was founded around 1000 AD by monks from the Lérins Islands outside Cannes. They built a monastery and named the village after Saint Maxime. Fishing was the economic mainstay for the inhabitants but during the early 19th century increasing amounts of lumber, cork, olive oil and wine were shipped to Marseille and Italy. The village grew and in the 20th century began to attract artists, poets and writers who enjoyed the climate, beautiful surroundings and azure blue water. In front of the old town is the characteristic tower, La Tour Carrée, built by the monks in the early 16th century to protect the village from invaders. With an addition of a battery of cannons and with the Tour du Portalet in Saint-Tropez the whole bay was protected. As late as in the beginning of the 19th century, Napoleon ordered a restoration of the battery while also adding cannons on the Lérins Islands. The tower is now a museum. World War II On 15 August 1944, the beach of Sainte-Maxime was at the centre of Operation Dragoon, the invasion and liberation of Southern France during World War II. \\"Attack Force Delta\\", based around the 45th Division, landed at Sainte-Maxime. After fierce house-to-house fighting the Germans were defeated and eventually surrendered. By the foot of the Harbour pier and by La Garonette beach in the far east of the commune, memorials at the respective landing places honour the United States troops. At La Garonette beach, but formally in Les Issambres, (Roquebrune-sur-Argens commune), the sailing centre is named La Batterie, as it was the location of a German artillery battery. Economy Avenue Raoul Nordling Tourism is the largest source of revenue for Sainte-Maxime nowadays, but the town remains lively all year round with 13 968 inhabitants as of 2017. There is the old town with shops, markets, restaurants, bars and cafés, opposite the harbour. On the pier are marine shops and an upscale restaurant, and also fast boat transportation with Les Bateaux Verts to Les Issambres, St Tropez and Port Grimaud. There is a shoreline promenade with parks, pine trees, boulodrome Prince Bertil, the tourist office and the city beaches, as well as a casino with its own piece of white sand. In addition to the city beaches, there are the Blue Flag-certified supervised ones. On the west side, The Croisette has a sailing school. On the east side of the town are La Nartelle, La Plage des Eléphants and La Garonette (also called Val D'Esquieres), which all provide water-skiing and jet-skiing activities. In addition, there are several smaller beaches that are unsupervised, for a total of 10 km of publicly accessible shoreline. There are eight golf courses within a 30 minute radius by car. Notable people Jean de Brunhoff, the author of the Babar books, lived in Sainte-Maxime for some time and here created the first book. One of the beaches – La Plage des Eléphants – is named after the famous blue elephant. The Swedish royal family (of the Bernadotte dynasty) owns a villa, Mirage, in the town's central area. It was originally acquired by Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland in 1946 as a second home for himself and his at that time unofficial life partner Lilian Davies, later Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland. The central and ocean facing boulodrome in Sainte-Maxime is named after the prince, as he was a regular player who appreciated the uncomplicated and warm reception of the village locals. Raoul Nordling was the Swedish consul in Paris 1944 that made great efforts to save Paris and its citizens during the late phase of the Second World War. He persuaded General Choltitz to disobey Hitler's orders to destroy the French capital and many lives were saved before General Eisenhover approved General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque and Charles de Gaulle to re- enter the town. Norling had a house in Sainte-Maxime, Le Mas du Gay Savoir; he was also named an honorary citizen. Part of the road to Grimaud is named after him. Léon Gaumont was a French inventor, engineer and industrialist who was a pioneer of the motion picture industry. Gaumont often stayed in Sainte-Maxime where he owned a castle, Les Tourelles, built circa 1883. This residence served as a backdrop for several films including Judex conducted in 1916 by Louis Feuillade that was shot in part in Sainte-Maxime. The castle – with new buildings – is now a holiday resort. Léon Gaumont died in Sainte-Maxime in 1946. Paul Géraldy or Paul Lefevre (1885–1983) was a French poet and playwright. He had a house in Sainte-Maxime named Toi et moi (\\"You and me\\") which took its name from his second book (which was his breakthrough). The house is located east of the village above the Madrague beach and now split into apartments. Victor Margueritte (1866–1942) was a French novelist and a frequent guest in Sainte-Maxime. Around 1920, he bought and developed a large property, La Madrague, which stretched from the sea and climbed to the top of the Colline Meinier magnificently facing south. The writer lived in his tower with his wife until 1938. Michel Constantin (1924–2003) was a French movie actor. He was a frequent guest in Sainte-Maxime where he owned a villa at Beauvallon.

The park was opened in July 1921 as a tribute to the 2,587 Coventrians who died between 1914 and 1918 fighting in the First World War. The landscaped gardens and sports areas were created in the late-1920s and 1930s,Coventry City Council: History of the War Memorial Park Retrieved 4 October 2008 and the most prominent structure in the park is the city's war memorial monument, built in 1927. History Alternative proposal for the memorial, for the Corporation of the City of Coventry, by an anonymous hand, circa 1925 Land The park was opened in July 1921 as a tribute to the 2,587 Coventrians who died between 1914 and 1918 fighting in the First World War. Coventry Council used money donated by the public to purchase the land from the Lords of Styvechale Manor, the Gregory-Hood family, when it was little more than a large grassed area that once formed Styvechale common. In the north of the park, the landscaped gardens and sports areas were created in the late-1920s and 1930s, Autumnal photograph of the iconic avenue of Atlantic cedars in Coventry's War Memorial Park looking North. During the Second World War, barrage balloons and anti-aircraft guns were sited in the park, and the large concrete blocks where they were positioned still exist in the Coat of Arms bridge area of the park. In 2013, the park was listed at Grade II on the statutory Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. The war memorial is a Grade II* listed building in its own right. In July 2013 the park gained green flag status, retaining it in 2017. On 16 July 2014 Prince William, Duke of Cambridge visited the park to formally launch the Centenary Fields programme of the Fields in Trust by granting the first designation under the scheme to the park. Monument At around high, the war memorial monument is the most prominent construction in the park. It was designed by local architect T. F. Tickner and £5,000 was raised from a public appeal that commenced in 1924 to fund the building work. It was built in 1927 and dedicated by Field Marshal Douglas Haig on 8 October 1927. It is made of Portland stone, and was built by John Gray who also built the Courtaulds works at Foleshill and a number of housing estates. Inside the memorial is a room called the Chamber of Silence which contains the \\"Roll of the Fallen\\", a list of all Coventry men killed in the two World Wars and the Gulf War, and is open to the public every year on Remembrance Sunday. Refurbishment Work started in August 2010 on a multi-million pound refurbishment of the park, involving about 30 projects taking place around the park over a ten-month period. The work was funded by a £2.8 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund together with money from Coventry City Council. Additionally a grant of £50,000 was awarded in February 2011 to create a new under-8s play area in the park.  Facilities and events  The park's facilities include football pitches, bowling greens, a small golf course, tennis courts, a splash and play area, an aviary for small birds, and a skate board area, but it mainly comprises large open green areas with many trees and shrubberies. A perimeter path lies just inside the park's boundaries, and now encircles the entire park following completion of groundwork on the south-western segment in the summer of 2006. The park is the venue for a number of annual events including the Godiva Festival, Donkey Derby, Caribbean Festival and the Vaisakhi Mela. The park also holds weekly parkruns – free, timed 5km (3.1mi) runs – that attract over 300 people to the park every Saturday. Car parks The main car park is a large tarmaced area with access from Kenilworth Road. Travel de Courcey (in conjunction with Coventry City Council and Transport for West Midlands) operates a park and ride scheme between here and Coventry city centre. There is a much smaller car park on Coat of Arms Bridge Road on the southern side of the park and another small car park near the northern end of Leamington Road.

After he lost his re-election in 2003, he was appointed the first Minister of Defence of the Fourth Republic with no prior military background from 2003 to 2007. He was later elected to the Senate in 2015, serving one term under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) representing Kano Central Senatorial District.

In 2015, Kwankwaso unsuccessfully contested the presidential primaries nomination under the opposition All Progressive Congress, but lost to Muhammad Buhari. In 2018, he returned to People's Democratic Party (PDP) and contested the presidential primaries losing out to Atiku Abubakar. Background Kwankwaso was born on 21 October 1956 in Kwankwaso a village located in Madobi. He attended Kwankwaso Primary School, Gwarzo Boarding Senior Primary School, Wudil Craft School and Kano Technical College before proceeding to Kaduna Polytechnic where he did both his National Diploma, and Higher National Diploma.

Kwankwaso was an active student leader during his school days and was an elected official of the Kano State Students Association. Kwankwaso started work in 1975, at the Kano State Water Resources and Engineering Construction Agency (WRECA). He served in the civil service for 17 years in various capacities and rose through the ranks as the principal engineer.  Early political career  In 1992, Kwankwaso made his entry into politics on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He belonged to the People's Front faction of the SDP led by General Shehu Yar'adua and made up of other politicians such as his former boss Senator Magaji Abdullahi, Babagana Kingibe, Atiku Abubakar, Bola Tinubu, Tony Anenih, Chuba Okadigbo, Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila and Lamidi Adedibu amongst others. In 1992, Kwankwaso was elected as a member of House of Representatives representing Madobi Federal Constituency. His subsequent election as deputy speaker in the House brought him to the limelight of national politics. During the 1995 Constitutional Conference, Kwankwaso was elected as one of the delegates from Kano, as a member of the People's Democratic Movement led by Yar'adua.

Kwankwaso was elected as the Governor of Kano State on 29 May 1999. His first tenure as the governor of Kano State was very eventful because of several other groups who were opposed to his high-handed governorship and his attempt at supporting Yoruba President Olusegun Obasanjo. In 2003, he lost re- election to his rival Malam Ibrahim Shekarau. In 2011, Kwankwaso was re- elected for a second term in office as Governor of Kano State from 29 May 2011 to 29 May 2015.

In August 2013, Kwankwaso was amongst seven serving governors who formed the G-7 faction within the PDP. In November 2013, Kwankwaso alongside five members of the G-7 defected to the new opposition party the All Progressives Congress (APC). In June 2014, Kwankwaso was at loggerheads with long time Emir of Kano Ado Bayero over his appointment of Waziri (Vizier) of the Kano Emirate Council. On 6 June 2014, Ado Bayero died and a succession crisis loomed amongst the royals. On 8 June 2014, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi suspended Central Bank governor and Dan Majen Kano (Son of Emir-Maje) emerged as the new Emir of Kano. His accession led to widespread protests from supporters of Sanusi Ado Bayero son of the late Emir and Chiroman Kano (Crown Prince), and allegations that Kwankwaso supported Sanusi because of the 2015 presidential election.  Minister of Defence  From 2003 to 2007, Kwankwaso appointed Minister of Defence in President Olusegun Obasanjo second cabinet. He replaced General Theophilus Danjuma, and with no prior military background used the influential ministry at the federal level to undermine his opponents especially the Kano State Government.  Elections  In 2007, Kwankwaso resigned his ministerial position to contest the Kano State governorship election but he lost because he had been indicted by a Government White Paper. Alhaji Ahmed Garba Bichi later replaced him as the governorship candidate of the party. After losing the bid from his party to contest the 2007 elections, he was appointed as the Special Envoy to Somalia and Darfur by President Olusegun Obasanjo; and was later appointed by President Umaru Yar'Adua as a Board Member of the Niger Delta Development Commission, a position he resigned from in 2010. Kano state and supreme leader of the Kwankwasiyya ideology, 29 May 2011 In 2011, Kwankwaso was re-elected for a second term in office as Governor of Kano State from 29 May 2011 to 29 May 2015. In 2014, Kwankwaso used his large political following in Kano to contest the APC presidential primaries. The presidential primaries results held in Lagos was: Muhammadu Buhari with 3,430 votes, Kwankwaso with 974 votes, Atiku Abubakar with 954 votes, Rochas Okorocha with 400 votes and Sam Nda-Isiah with 10 votes. Coming in second, Kwankwaso endorsed the winner Muhammadu Buhari and later secured nomination to the Senate of Nigeria representing Kano Central Senatorial District from May 2015 to May 2019. In July 2018, Kwankwaso alongside fourteen serving senators of the APC defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In October 2018, Kwankwaso contested the PDP presidential primaries. At the presidential primaries held in Rivers, amongst twelve presidential aspirants Kwankwaso came in fourth behind: Atiku Abubakar with 1,532 votes, Aminu Tambuwal with 693 votes, Bukola Saraki with 317 votes and Kwankwaso with 158 votes. Kwankwaso later endorsed the winner Atiku Abubakar and refused to seek re-election into the Senate, with Ibrahim Shekarau replacing him. Kwankwaso campaigned heavily for his son-in-law Abba Kabir Yusuf to emerge as the Governor in Kano State. The election was later declared inconclusive in favour of incumbent Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.  Corruption  On 9 March 2004, the chief judge of Kano state swore in the six-member commission of inquiry which was headed by Hon. Justice Ahmed Badamasi as chairman to inquire the activities of Kwankwaso. The commission commenced sitting on 19 March 2004 and made its report available and for the government to issue the white paper by November 2004, when he was indicted. On 2 July 2015, justice Mohammed Yahaya of the Kano High Court had restrained the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC) from arresting or restraining Kwankwaso in its investigation for alleged misappropriation of N10 billion pension funds while serving as Kano State governor. But two weeks later on 16 July 2015, the same judge in the Kano High Court voided his earlier order and granted the EFCC a judgement to enable the commission to investigate, arrest and prosecute Kwankwaso. Justice Muhammed Yahaya also fined N50,000 against Kwankwaso for \\"time-wasting.\\" However the EFCC has denied and refuted claims of any pending corruption case and prosecution against Kwankwaso.https://guardian.ng/news/efcc-denies-any-pending-case-against- kwankwaso-orji/https://tribuneonlineng.com/kwankwaso-not-probe- efcc/https://www.latestnigeriannews.com/news/3607382/kwankwaso-not-under- probe-efcc.html Kwankwaso himself has strongly denied and rejected any corruption allegation against him, describing it as mere political blackmail, mischievous and untrue which is sponsored by his enemies and political rivals to tarnish his image and reputation, Kwankwaso even went ahead and filed suit in court through his lawyer seeking compensation for tarnishing his image.https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/190251-kwankwaso- slams-n10-bn-suit-against-kano- pensioners.htmlhttps://thenationonlineng.net/efcc-not-investigating-me-says- kwankwaso/https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/03/04/kwankwaso-denies- being-investigated-for-fraud/https://thenigerialawyer.com/efcc-not- investigating-me-says-kwankwaso/  Legacy  Kwankwaso's time in office was characterised with a number of notable achievements.

It was commissioned for the 1999 NT Shell Connections programme, in which regional youth theatre groups compete to stage short plays by established playwrights. The basic premise of the play, following on from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is \\"What happened to the Capulets and Montagues after Romeo and Juliet died?\\". The setting of After Juliet is described as \\"Verona. Or it could be Edinburgh, Dublin, Birmingham, New York City, or Liverpool. It could be 1500, 1900, 2000, or 3000\\".ACQUIS The only place that After Juliet cannot be set is Glasgow, as one of the characters, Rhona, is from Glasgow, and away from home.Scotsman.com Living Macdonald's daughter Keira Knightley appeared in the Heatham House Youth Centre's NT Connections production, which made the regional finals. It continues to be performed by youth groups around the world. Plot The play centres on Rosaline, Juliet's cousin and Romeo's ex- flame. Ironically, Rosaline had been in love with Romeo, but was playing \\"hard to get\\". Tortured by the loss of her love, Rosaline has become a sullen, venomous woman. She actively seeks to be elected the 'Princess of Cats' and run the Capulet family. Meanwhile, the Capulets and Montagues have obeyed Prince Escalus and called a truce. The truce quickly descends into a farce as both sides continue to rage against each other. Amid the turmoil more doomed love springs-between Benvolio Montague and Rosaline. Benvolio is warned by Valentine (Mercutio's twin brother) to stay away from her if he knows what is right. The climax of the play comes during an election to determine whether or not Rosaline or Petruchio (Tybalt's brother) will succeed Tybalt as the Prince or Princess of Cats. The election fails to have any results and the fate of the truce is left open-ended. A 2009 youth, stage version of the show featured Valentine as the twin sister of Mercutio; this added an extra storyline where Valentine is in love with Benvolio and is jealous of Rosaline. Benvolio's final scene ends with Valentine running off stage after his rejection.

She was named after the 3rd Rajah of Sarawak, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke. At the outbreak of war with Japan the ship was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and armed. Description Ship designed by naval architect F.G Ritchie OBE, of Ritchie & Bisset, Singapore. Ramage & Ferguson of Leith, Edinburgh's harbour area, built the ship, completing her in February 1928. The launch by Her Highness the Ranee was scheduled for 10 November 1927 at Leith. The ship sailed from Leith for Singapore on 17 April 1928. Vyner Brooke was flush decked with 'tween decks, all steel sheathed in with six watertight bulkheads. The main deck was as clear as possible of structures for deck passenger use with accommodations forward for crew and aft for stewards, clerks and ship's boys. The refrigeration plant, designed to keep the cold store two degrees below freezing, was located on the main deck. Cabins amidships on the upper deck provided for 44 first-class passengers with a by saloon forward of the cabins. A staircase at the after end of the saloon led to a shade deck and two de luxe cabins and a private sitting room. The ship was equipped with wireless and carried lifeboats, rafts and lifebelts for 650 people and could carry at least 200 deck passengers. She was had six corrugated furnaces with a combined grate area of that heated two single-ended Barclay, Curle & Co. boilers with a combined heating surface of . These fed steam at 180 lbf/in2 to a three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine built by Ramage and Ferguson. The engine was rated at 297 NHP and drove twin screws. Cargo was handled by two three ton cranes at each hatch with a heavy, twenty ton derrick. Royal Navy Requisition At the beginning of the war in the Pacific Vyner Brooke was requisitioned by the Royal Navy, painted gray and armed with a four-inch deck gun forward, two Lewis guns aft and depth charges. The ship's Australian and British officers were mostly Malay Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve and had been asked to remain aboard the now HMS Vyner Brooke. The ship's company, under the command of her peacetime captain, Richard E. Borton, was augmented by reservists, some survivors of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse and European and Malay professional sailors. Sinking and massacre On 14 February 1942 in World War II, while evacuating nurses and wounded servicemen away from Singapore she was bombed by Japanese aircraft and sunk. Some of the survivors who reached Bangka Island east of Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies were massacred by the Imperial Japanese Army. Others were imprisoned in Palembang and Muntok POW camps.

The street is rich in 19th and early 20th century historic architecture. Another view of the street. Rua da Junqueira, mostly known simply as Junqueira, is a traditional shopping street in Póvoa de Varzim in Portugal. The street, located in Póvoa de Varzim City Center, it is the main and the oldest shopping street of the city, with several boutiques, some opened for over 100 years, and small shopping centers. Historic architecture was preserved and it is also the most popular tourist area outside the beach in Póvoa de Varzim, attracting millions of visitors. It is a landmark for the city and neighboring areas.Um dia de festa na Rua da Junqueira - Póvoa Semanário Junqueira also refers to the area surrounding this street. In early times it was a fishermen's district. History Junqueira as seen from República Square. Early history The axis of Rua da Junqueira street appeared in the written records, by the first time, in 1694 and was known as Rua de São Roque da Junqueira. But Junqueira is much older; several artifacts from the Roman Era were found in several street re-arraignments. It is considered part of Villa Euracini and could be the site of a Roman fish factory. Junqueira probably takes its name from rushes (junco in Portuguese) that were found there before it was urbanized in the 18th century. Junqueira was wetland and old bridge ruins were found in the waterfront when the casino underground parking lot was being constructed in the late 1990s. Junqueira, the town's early fishermen district Lieutenant Francisco da Veiga Leal in the news of the Town of Póvoa de Varzim on May 24, 1758 spoke about this street: \\"At the end of the pavement that starts at the seashore there is a square where the Pillory is located, and from there the rua da Ponte street begins, and it keeps this name until the sands of the beach are reached, at the middle of its length the new street of Junqueira begins, it links with its street of Areosa and Senra, and the later with the suburb of old town\\". In 1762, the street had 49 houses on the left side and 29 on the right one; in 1792 it was inhabited, mostly, by fishermen families.Projecto da Rua da Junqueira (1894-1895) - Arquivo Municipal da Póvoa de Varzim 18th century: The development of the shopping street by fish sellers Junqueira in 1919. In the 18th century, the area around Póvoa Fortress, known as \\"Ribeira\\", became the center of trade and fish brine, where several warehouses were located. In the New Street of Junqueira, fishermen, sellers, fish traders and beach goers started to implement the characteristic way-of-living of this street, it became one of the main ones in the city. 19th century: A bourgeois Shopping street In the 19th century, Junqueira became mostly used for commerce, where all kinds of goods could be found, by then it became dominated by the business bourgeoisie, and was seen as their living room to attend outsiders. Therefore, most of Póvoa's religious processions marched throw the street and balconies were decorated.As Procissões na Póvoa de Varzim (1900–1950). Volume 1 - Deolinda Carneiro, Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto. 2006 A narrow and twisted street, in the City Council meeting of October 30, 1839, it was stated: \\"the necessity to rectify the part of Junqueira since the Sam Roque square to the beginning of Hortas Street as it is well-known that being one of the busiest in town, it becomes impassable when it rains, due to a muddy area that forms in there with the street reduced to a narrow passage, and is common, that people, mules, oxen, and even litters passing over a pavement that is almost all ruined (...) the Street will have two sidewalks in each side made out of stonework with a line of stonework in the middle...\\". In 1856, the street kept with similar problems. The first widening project appeared in 1876 and in February 1882, the city council decided to proceed with the widening using a project by architect Manuel Fortunato d’Oliveira Motta. This has no success due to the opposition of the landowners. After friendly attempts, the city hall appealed to the courts against the landowners that still opposed. These reforms took place during the 1893–1895 administration. Near Ouriveraria Gomes goldsmithery, suppliers of the Portuguese Royal family. A streetcar line through the Rua da Junqueira street existed at the end of the 19th century to the first decade of the 20th century; the tramline started in Praça do Almada and aimed to reach Baths Beach, later the tramline was transferred from Junqueira to the parallel Rua Tenente Valadim street. The 20th century and pedestrianization In the city council meeting July 2, 1912, after the implementation of the Republic, the alteration of street naming was determined and changed to 5 de Outubro Street, the day of the republican revolution. In 1926, it was written in a newspaper: \\"Councilmen are undeceived, while Póvoa remains as Póvoa, the Passeio Alegre will be Passeio Alegre and Junqueira street, Junqueira street\\". The official naming remained until January 1966. Given its shopping nature, Junqueira street became pedestrian in 1955 by order of the mayor Major Mota, as such, it was one of the oldest in Portugal not allowing cars and \\"vehicles of any kind\\". The shopping and business importance of the street grew to such an extent, that today the street has not much people living in there. Urban morphology Rua da Junqueira runs from the civic center located in Praça do Almada square to the waterfront in a perpendicular east-west axis. It is rich in 19th century and early 20th century architecture. It was once the street that people from Northern Portugal used to reach Póvoa's beaches and today, despite it lost its usefulness as a way to reach the waterfront, people still want to go throw the street. The statue of Major Mota, the mayor responsible for pedestrianising the street, is located by the entrance of the street near Praça da República square. Some of the nearby streets and squares: Praça da República, Largo David Alves and the small pedestrianised streets of Sousa Campos, da Ponte, do Paredão, dos Cafés, da Alegria e Travessa do Cais Novo, also became pedestrian. In total, there is about one kilometer of pedestrian ways. Junqueira has squares in both ends: Praça da República Square (Praça da República) in the east end; and another located near the waterfront — the Largo David Alves Square (Largo David Alves). This busy traditional street is well known for its jewelry. The most notable of its goldsmiths is Ourivesaria Gomes, where, during the Estado Novo, important people of the regime were often seen with their families. Open for more than 100 years, Ourivesaria Gomes was the goldsmithery of the Portuguese Royal House, and it had kings, nobility and the clergy as customers. The bullet used for the assassination attempt of Pope John Paul II was encrusted in the crown of Our Lady of Fatima by these goldsmiths. There are about 100 stores, some of them over a hundred years old,comércio tradicional reage aos « shoppings» - Novo Press/Sapo Notícias Shops are located on the ground floor of buildings; the other floors are, sometimes used as residences. These houses often have old Portuguese- style façades; the street is very narrow, which provides some protection from the prevailing wind and winter rain, and provides shade in summer.

It is his interpretation of \\"Catfish Blues\\", a Delta blues that dates back to 1920s Mississippi. \\"Still a Fool\\", recorded by Muddy Waters a year later using the same arrangement and melody, reached number nine on the Billboard R&B; chart. \\"Rollin' Stone\\" has been recorded by a variety of artists, the rock group the Rolling Stones are named after the song, and the magazine Rolling Stone may also have been, in part. cited at Earlier songs In 1928, Jim Jackson recorded \\"Kansas City Blues Parts 3 and 4\\", a follow-up to his highly successful \\"Jim Jackson's Kansas City Blues Parts 1 and 2\\". Jackson's lyrics included: Several other early songs also explored variations on the catfish and/or fishing theme. In 1941, Tommy McClennan and his sometime partner Robert Petway each recorded versions of the song. Petway's was the first to be titled \\"Catfish Blues\\" and is sometimes cited as the basis for Muddy Waters' \\"Rollin' Stone\\". However, according to one biographer \\"They'd been singing \\"Catfish Blues\\" for years in the Delta, but it never sounded like \\"Rollin' Stone\\". Muddy Waters song \\"Rollin' Stone\\" has been identified (along with \\"Walkin' Blues\\", the single's B-side) as one of the first songs that Muddy Waters learned to play and an early favorite. The words refer to the traditional proverb, \\"A rolling stone gathers no moss\\". Called \\"a brooding, minor-hued drone piece\\", \\"Rollin' Stone\\" is a mid- to slow-tempo blues notated in 4/4 time in the key of E major. } Although the instrumental section uses the IV and V chords, the vocal sections remain on the I chord, giving the song a modal quality often found in Delta blues songs. In addition to the traditional catfish verses, Waters added: Unlike most of his early recordings which have bass or other instrumental accompaniment, \\"Rollin' Stone\\" is a solo performance by Muddy Waters on vocal and electric guitar. It has \\"much empty space ... imbued with the power of a pause, of letting a note hang in the air, the anticipation of the next one\\". \\"Rollin' Stone\\" was the first Muddy Waters record released on Chess Records and the second overall for the label (previous releases were on Aristocrat Records). It did not reach the national record charts, but sold about 70,000 copies and allowed Muddy Waters to quit his day job. Still a Fool In 1951, Muddy Waters used the vocal melody and guitar figure from \\"Rollin' Stone\\" for \\"Still a Fool\\".Chess 1480 The song was more successful, reaching number nine in the Billboard R&B; chart. Rather than a solo piece, Little Walter on second guitar and Leonard Chess on bass drum accompanied Muddy on vocal and guitar. Subsequent versions of \\"Rollin' Stone\\" or \\"Catfish Blues\\" often use some lyrics from \\"Still a Fool\\" (sometimes called \\"Two Trains Running\\" after the opening verse). Influence and recognition English blues rock group the Rolling Stones and the music magazine Rolling Stone took their names from the song. In 2000, the song was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award; in 2004, it was included at number 459 by Rolling Stone in its list of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". In 2019, the Blues Foundation inducted \\"Rollin' Stone\\" into the Blues Hall of Fame as a \\"Classic of Blues Recording\\". In 1967, \\"Rollin' Stone\\" (and \\"Still a Fool\\") was used as part of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Catfish Blues\\", a homage to Muddy Waters, and included on the albums BBC Sessions and Blues.

Early life Sands was born on October 12, 1757 in Cow Neck which is now in the Village of Sands Point, located then in Queens County but since 1899 in Nassau County, New York. He was one of eight children born to John Sands (1708–1760) and Elizabeth Cornwell Sands (1711–1782), who also descended from one of the three original families who owned Cow Neck. Sands and his siblings received limited schooling. His eldest brother, John Sands (1737-1811), served as a colonel during the Revolutionary War and was also a member of the New York State Assembly for Queens County, 1784 to 1785. His younger brother, Comfort Sands (1748-1834), also served on the side of the colonists during the Revolutionary War. Family The Sands family was one of the original three families that settled in and owned what is now Sands Point, New York. Born in Reading, Berkshire, England, James Sands (d. 1695) immigrated to Plymouth, MA with his wife Sarah and their children, circa 1658. Along with several other men, James Sands obtained what is now Block Island, Rhode Island from the original inhabitants of the island, the Narragansetts, in 1660. In 1661, Sands sailed from Taunton, MA and moved his family to Block Island and had six children. Career Sands served as a captain in the 4th New York Regiment during the American Revolutionary War, and engaged in mercantile pursuits. He soon prospered in the West India trade. During the Revolutionary War, he served on several influential committees and led protests against the Crown.\\"HISTORICAL DISTRICTS.\\" Real Property Probate and Trust Journal.Vol. 1, No. 3 (1966): 204-11.

In 1783, Sands and his brother Comfort Sands formed a business partnership dealing in foreign trade and land speculation. Their partnership included real estate ventures and a rope making manufacturing business in Brooklyn. In 1784, the Sands brothers purchased 160 acres of land along the Brooklyn waterfront for $12,000. They acquired the land, originally owned by the Rapelje family (also spelled Rapelye), early Dutch settlers of Brooklyn, under the 1779 New York State \\"Act for the Forfeiture and Sale of the Estates of Persons who Have Adhered to the Enemies of this State.\\" The land acquired in the purchase included what is now the location of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (previously the New York Naval Shipyard), as well as the DUMBO and Vinegar Hill neighborhoods bordering the East River in Brooklyn. The waterfront area was to be the site of a new, planned community, called Olympia. It was to be divided into both commercial and residential properties and would be connected to Manhattan via the nearby ferry service. Though the land was surveyed, Olympia was never completed. The Sands brothers were also co-founders and directors of the Bank of New York, along with Alexander Hamilton. Political career Beginning on July 1, 1791, he was a member of the New York State Senate during the 15th until the 20th New York State Legislature, and of the Council of Appointment in 1796. He vacated his seat in the Senate on April 26, 1797 when President John Adams appointed him Collector of the Port of New York. He held this office until July 9, 1801, when he was removed by President Thomas Jefferson. He was elected as a Federalist to the Eighth Congress, and served from March 4, 1803 to March 3, 1805. He was President of the board of trustees of the Village of Brooklyn in 1824. He was again elected to the 19th United States Congress, and served from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1827. Personal life On March 9, 1780, Sand married Ann Ayscough (1761–1851), the daughter of Richard Ayscough, a surgeon in the British Army. St. Ann's Church, the first Episcopal church in Brooklyn incorporated in 1787, was named in her honor. In 1786, Joshua from Pearl Street in lower Manhattan to Brooklyn. He bought land along the Brooklyn waterfront in 1784, and built a three-story Federal style mansion at 31 Front Street in what is now the Sands Point neighborhood of Brooklyn. At its completion in 1787, it was the largest mansion in Brooklyn. Ann Sands hosted weekly church gatherings in the family home for many years. Together, Joshua and Ann were the parents of twelve children, including: * Joshua Ratoon Sands (1795–1883), who served as a Rear Admiral in the United States Navy. Ann Sands died in Brooklyn in 1851. Joshua sand also died at Brooklyn, and was buried at St. Paul's Church Cemetery in Eastchester, New York. In 1852, he was re-interred in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Legacy There are several places that hold the Sands family name in New York; Sands Point, New York and Sands Street in Brooklyn. Further, St. Ann's Church, in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, was reorganized, renamed, and reincorporated in 1795, honoring Ann Sands for her contribution to the founding of the church.

A member wearing the CSI Chief Scout's Award. It does not bear the World Crest, meaning it was awarded before January 1, 2004 A similarly named award, The Chief Scout's Award was the highest award for Scouts in Scouting Ireland until the development of the ONE Programme. The precise criteria for the Chief Scout's Award in Scouting Ireland as a result of the merger of CSI and SAI are unclear at present . It is the final step in the personal progressive scheme of the former CSI. The SAI used it as an award to be achieved in tandem with the progressive badge scheme. The Chief Scout's Award is an individual recognition of commitment to the Scout Law, dedication to attain personal ambitions and the desire to contribute to and to improve society. Chief Scout's Award holders have often been received at Áras an Uachtaráin by the President of Ireland, most recently in 2004 by Mary McAleese, who is the Patron of Scouting Ireland. It is estimated that about 1 in 300 Scouts achieve the award, giving it the name; \\"1 in 300 award\\" The first recipient was William Cronin, 1st/4th Tipperary (Clonmel), . History of the Chief Scout's Award The award was introduced by Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland in the early 1960s to replace the Silver Palm Award. The first awards were presented by Chief Scout CJ \\"Kit\\" Murphy. Scouting Ireland S.A.I. also awarded a Chief Scout's Award, with successful applicant receiving a cloth badge, a certificate signed by the Chief Scout, and a special neckerchief on Founder's Day in the Mansion House, Dublin. Since the foundation of Scouting Ireland, award recipients have been presented with a pendant (See Award section below) The Chief Scout award is now standardised across the five programme sections Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Ventures and Rovers. Requirements Requirements for the award are a number of Adventure Skills, Special Interest Badges, an Expedition, and camp with an inter-cultural aspect. The progress of the award is led by the participant, with the help of the Scouter. Rover Scouts are presented with their Chief Scout Award/Gold President's Award/Gold DOE Award in an annual ceremony in Trinity College, Dublin. Chief Scout's Award (1960s-2010s CSI) On this pathway, Scouts complete a personal project. The Scout meets with the Chief Scout, or his representative, and discusses his or her own interests and a project is derived from the candidate's own individual goals. More often than not the project does not directly relate to Scouting. It always, however, relates to one of the development trails which Scouting identifies as crucial to personal growth and achievement; these being personal, spiritual, physical, emotional, social, intellectual and character development. Projects vary widely, from community projects to local history studies and from putting on exhibitions and shows to raising awareness of charitable causes. Key to this pathway is planning, identifying a goal, endeavouring to attain that goal and finally evaluation of the project as a whole. Setting the challenges Scouts with their Scout Leader agree their own challenges in each of the six categories. The challenges are recorded on the form. The Scout Leader should ensure a suitable Standard Of The Challenges is achieved by verifying that the challenges have been set in accordance with the criteria laid down below and then sign this form before it is sent to National Office. The standard of the challenges should be relevant to the Scout's ability and the quality of Scouting in the troop, so that they are both challenging and achievable. Upon registered as a participant in the Award, acknowledgement from the Chief Scout is issued accepting the challenges and stating the Chief Scout's Award registration number. Participants have one year from that date to complete their challenges and submit the completed logbook. Challenge 1: Expedition Plan and organise an expedition by foot, bicycle, boat or canoe of at least two nights' duration covering either: * 30 km on foot over open country or * 100 km by bicycle or * 30 km by boat or canoe (coastal, river, canal or lake) The expedition should be planned under the supervision of the Scout Leader and all safety precautions for the various disciplines must be adhered to. The expedition may be completed with other members of the troop doing the Chief Scout's Award, but a maximum of three Scouts may count the same expedition as part of their Chief Scout's Award. Challenge 2: Day Activity Plan and lead a day activity such as a hike, cycle or boating trip for other members of the troop producing route cards, maps, safety considerations and emergency procedures. The activity should have a novel programme on route, e.g. orienteering, dusk to dawn, historical visit etc. * Hike 15 km over open country * Cycle 50 km road or off-road * Boat / Canoe 10 km river, canal, lake or coastal Only the planner or organiser may count this towards their Chief Scout's Award. Challenge 3: Scout Skills Lead the construction of one of the following items, which have not been constructed before: * A monkey bridge over a river * A look-out tower for summer camp * A classic altar fire with a back boiler * A classic altar fire with an oven * A hyberbola gateway for the troop site campsite * A campsite gateway with look- out tower * A substantial knot board for the Scout hall * Build a raft and paddle it over a distance of half a mile * Construct a full nautical flag pole for the summer camp Challenge 4: Environment Undertake an environmental project in the form of an activity, research or survey relevant to the local area or an area in which the troop does most of its Scouting. This could be a campsite, woodland, park area, open land, beach or coastline. Challenge 5: Personal Challenge Set a personal challenge, not necessarily part of normal Scouting activities and not part of school work, to achieve during the year completing the Chief Scout's Award. This could be learning a new activity or skill or raising a current interest to a new level. Proficiency must be illustrated in a new interest or progress in an existing one. Challenge 6: Qualification Achieve or have achieved one of the following qualifications as part of the Chief Scout's Award: * Intermediate RLSS Resuscitation Award * RLSS Bronze Medallion * Recognised First-Aid Course * National Safety Association Swimming Level 4 * Intermediate Charge Certificate * Canoe badge * Orienteering award * Other award or proficiency of a programme nature defined by the National Scout or Sea Scout Team or Scout Leader Assessment of Completed Challenges The Chief Scout will assess the challenges, once completed, upon presentation of the Scout's logbook. Insignia Marble pendant (old CSI award) Pendant The award consists of a Connemara marble pendant with the World Crest embedded and a red rope finished with wooden beads at the end. The wooden beads on many award pendants to this day have swastikas carved in recess, see swastikas and Scouting. It seems that the presence of the carvings depend on the manufacturer. Prior to 2004 before the merging of CSI and SAI, instead of the World Crest, the beads on the CSI award were embedded with the Cross and Shamrock and it was accompanied by the Chief Scout's Award woggle which bore the insignia of the Chief. Only the Woodbadge beads and the Order of CúChulainn may be worn around the neck by members. Those who hold the Chief Scout's Award are entitled to wear it for life. Certificate A certificate, suitable for framing, was presented at all CSA ceremonies and were signed by the Chief Scout, unlike the certificate for the National Scout Award (the element of the progressive scheme which directly preceded the CSA on the CSI pathway) which was traditionally signed by the Chief Commissioner.

Sharma was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, 19th Hyderabad Regiment, in 1942. He served in Burma during the Arakan Campaign of World War II, for which he was mentioned in despatches. Fighting in the Indo- Pakistani War of 1947-1948, Somnath Sharma was martyred on 3 November 1947 while repulsing Pakistani infiltrators near Srinagar Airport; for his gallantry and sacrifice in this battle of Badgam, he was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra. Early life Sharma was born on 31 January 1923, to a Dogra Brahmin family at Dadh, Kangra, Punjab (present day Himachal Pradesh). His father, Amar Nath Sharma, was a military officer. Several of his siblings served in the military. Sharma completed his schooling at Sherwood College, Nainital, before enrolling at the Prince of Wales Royal Military College in Dehradun. He later studied at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. During his childhood, Somnath was influenced by the teachings of Krishna and Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, taught to him by his grandfather. Military career On 22 February 1942, upon his graduation from the Royal Military College, Sharma was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, 19th Hyderabad Regiment, of the British Indian Army (later to become the Indian Army's 4th Battalion, Kumaon Regiment). During World War II, he saw action against the Japanese in Burma during the Arakan Campaign. At that time he served under the command of Colonel K. S. Thimmayya, who would later rise to the rank of general and become Chief of the Army Staff from 1957 to 1961. Sharma was mentioned in despatches for his actions during the fighting of the Arakan Campaign. Throughout his military career, Sharma was greatly influenced by his uncle Captain K. D. Vasudeva's gallantry in action. Vasudeva also served with the 8th Battalion, participating in the Malayan Campaign during which he died aiding hundreds of soldiers under his command to survive from the Japanese offensive. Battle of Badgam On 27 October 1947, a batch of troops of the Indian Army was deployed in response to the invasion by Pakistan on 22 October into the Kashmir Valley. On 31 October, D Company of 4th Battalion of Kumaon Regiment, under the command of Sharma, was airlifted to Srinagar. During this time, his left hand was in a plaster cast as a result of injuries sustained previously on the hockey field, but he insisted on being with his company in combat and was subsequently given permission to go. On 3 November, a batch of three companies was deployed to the Badgam area on patrol duties. Their objective was to check the infiltrators moving toward Srinagar from the north. As there was no enemy movement, two of the three deployed companies returned to Srinagar at 2:00pm. However, Sharma's D Company, was ordered to stay in position until 3:00pm. At 2:35pm, Sharma's company was fired upon from the local resident houses in Badgam but counter-fire was not ordered to avoid injuring or killing innocent civilians. Suddenly, a tribal lashkar (English: militiamen) of 700 infiltrators approached Badgam from the direction of Gulmarg. D Company was soon surrounded from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from mortar fire. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if lost. Under heavy fire, and outnumbered by a ratio of seven to one, he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself to the enemy fire as he ran from one post to the other. When heavy casualties adversely affected the company's firing power, Sharma took upon himself the task of distributing ammunition to his men, operating light machine guns. While busy fighting the infiltrators, a mortar shell exploded on a pile of ammunition near him. Before he succumbed to his injuries, he transmitted a message to his brigade's headquarters which read: By the time a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the position held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified by means of the leather holster of his pistol and a few pages of Bhagavad Gita in his chest pocket. Param Vir Chakra On 21 June 1950, Sharma's award of the Param Vir Chakra, for his actions on 3 November 1947 in defending the Srinagar airport, was gazetted. This was the first time the honour had been awarded since its inception. Coincidentally, Savitri Khanolkar, the mother-in-law of Sharma's brother, was the designer of the Param Vir Chakra. The official citation reads: Legacy National War Memorial, New Delhi National War Memorial, India. In the 1980s, the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), a Government of India enterprise under the aegis of the Ministry of Shipping, named fifteen of their crude oil tankers in honour of the Param Vir Chakra recipients. The crude oil tanker named MT Major Somnath Sharma, PVC was delivered to SCI on 11 June 1984. The tanker was phased out after 25 years service. In popular culture The first episode of the TV series on the lives of Param Vir Chakra winners, Param Vir Chakra (1988) covered Sharma's actions of 3 November 1947. In that episode, his part was played by Farooque Sheikh. The episode was directed by Chetan Anand.

Mazeppa is a narrative poem written by the English Romantic poet Lord Byron in 1819. It is based on a popular legend about the early life of Ivan Mazepa (1639–1709), who later became Hetman (military leader) of Ukraine.Mazeppa is a historical spelling; in modern documents the historical figure is referred to as Ivan Mazepa. However, reprints of Byron's poem keep the spelling Mazeppa. This article uses the \\"Mazeppa\\" spelling when referring to the hero of the poem, and reserve \\"Mazepa\\" for references to the actual historical personage. Byron's poem was immediately translated into French, where it inspired a series of works in various art forms. The cultural legacy of Mazeppa was revitalised with the independence of Ukraine in 1991. According to the poem, the young Mazeppa has a love affair with a Polish Countess, Theresa, while serving as a page at the Court of King John II Casimir Vasa. Countess Theresa was married to a much older Count. On discovering the affair, the Count punishes Mazeppa by tying him naked to a wild horse and setting the horse loose. The bulk of the poem describes the traumatic journey of the hero strapped to the horse. The poem has been praised for its \\"vigor of style and its sharp realization of the feelings of suffering and endurance\\". Published within the same covers as Mazeppa was a short \\"Fragment of a Novel\\", one of the earliest vampire stories in English, and the poem \\"Ode\\". Overview The poem opens with a framing device: Ukrainian Hetman Mazeppa and the Swedish King Charles XII, together with their armies, are retreating from the Battle of Poltava, where they were defeated by the Russian Empire's forces. Exhausted and war-weary, the two men set up camp for the night (Stanzas 1–2). The King admires Mazeppa's horsemanship, and Mazeppa offers to tell him how he learnt this skill (Stanza 4). The poem then switches to the first person. Mazeppa describes his youth and his service as a page to King John II Casimir in Poland (Stanza 4). He becomes acquainted with Theresa, a beautiful Orientalized woman who \\"had the Asiatic eye\\" (l. 208). She is married to a Count who is thirty years her senior (l. 155). Mazeppa falls passionately in love with her (l. 266–7), is unable to control his passions (l. 290–295), and they meet at night and consummate their love (l. 298–300). However, the Count's men catch them together (l. 325–6) and bring him to the Count. The Count orders an unusually cruel punishment: Mazeppa is to be tied naked to a steed, which is then to be taunted and set loose (Stanza 9). Stanzas 10 to 18 recount the steed's flight across Eastern Europe, emphasising the pain, suffering and confusion that Mazeppa feels. However, the horse has seemingly limitless energy. Mazeppa nearly dies twice. In Stanza 13, he describes himself \\"full in death's face\\" (l. 557), but is restored when the horse swims through a river. Stanza 18 concludes with a description of \\"an icy sickness\\" and his vision of a raven flying overheard, ready to feast on his corpse. However, in Stanza 19, Mazeppa awakes to find himself in bed, with his wounds being tended by a \\"Cossack Maid\\" (l. 817). In the final stanza, Mazeppa's narrative ends. The poet-narrator describes Mazeppa preparing his bed for the evening. The King is already asleep (l. 867–880). Sources and inspiration There are historical sources which verify that Ivan Mazepa served in the Polish Court to John II Casimir. However, it is unclear why he left Poland in 1663 and returned to his homeland Ukraine. There is no historical evidence to support that Mazepa was exiled from Poland because of a love affair, or that he was punished by being strapped to a wild horse. However, this colorful legend was in circulation before Byron published his poem. Voltaire repeats it in History of Charles XII, King of Sweden (1731). This appears to have been Byron's main source for his poem: his \\"Advertisement\\" to the poem includes three long quotations from this work. Several critics have also speculated that Byron was familiar with the Mémoires d'Azéma (1764) by the French writer André Guillaume Contant Dorville, as there are significant similarities between the plot of that novel and of Byron's poem. Byron's references to Mazepa's participation in the Great Northern War alongside Charles XII, and their eventual defeat, are historically accurate. Analysis Horace Vernet (1789–1863) Many critics see Mazeppa as a transitional work in Byron's œuvre. Its dates of composition (1818–1819) place it between the earlier Eastern tales such as The Prisoner of Chillon (1817), which describe agonised, maudlin Byronic heroes and the later satirical, ironic Don Juan (1818–19). Leslie Marchand argues that Mazeppa is a partly unsuccessful work, as it is torn between high emotion and lighter irony. Mark Phillipson also sees Mazeppa as a transitional work of a \\"mongrel genre, the historical verse-romance\\". He argues that the poem is characterised by \\"moral ambivalence\\", and it remains unclear whether Mazeppa is a sympathetic hero or not. The question of whether the audience is expected to sympathise with Mazeppa has long been a subject for critical discussion. W. H. Marshall (1961) argues that Mazeppa is entirely unsympathetic: a \\"garrulous and egoistic old man\\" who never atones for his crime and whose hackneyed description of his passion for Teresa \\"becomes tedious at once\\". Jerome McGann (1968) takes the opposite view, arguing that Mazeppa's \\"wild ride\\" acts as an initiation process which makes him into a mature hero who is able to restrain his passions, unlike King Charles. He compares Mazeppa to Meursault, the existentialist hero of Albert Camus' novel The Stranger (1942). Hubert Babinski (1974) also offers a sympathetic reading of the character Mazeppa, pointing out his kindness to Charles and the horses in the opening and closing chapter. Babinski suggests that the hero Mazeppa is \\"one of Byron's most realistic creations, heroic within the bounds of human potential\\" and that he is a \\"fine specimen of a man\\".Babinski, pp. 33–36 He further argues that Mazeppa's death-in-life experiences during his \\"wild ride\\" are central to the poem's meaning and symbolic of the possibilities of human transformation and rebirth. He argues that the French painters who took up the Mazeppa theme further developed this idea.Babinski, p. 46 More recent interpretations have attempted to apply the insights of critical theory to the poem. Zbigniew Bialas (1999) offers a Saidian postcolonial reading, suggesting that Byron orientalises Eastern Europe and attempts to stamp an identity on Mazeppa, who nonetheless evades fixed national and political identities. Meanwhile, Jane Stabler (2004) reads the poem through the prism of postmodern theory, suggesting that uses Byron's Mazeppa as an example of a poem which \\"draws attention to the fictive contours of history\\". More recently, Thomas McLean (2012) considers Mazeppa \\"Byron's Polish poem\\" in light of the British fascination with Tadeusz Kościuszko and sees Mazeppa as an empowering figure for Europe's other smaller nations. Literary significance and reception Currier and Ives illustration to their 1846 printing of the poem Babinski points out that although Mazeppa received a flurry of reviews upon publication, later critics of Byron have rarely addressed the poem.Babinski, p. 21 Certainly there is less scholarship on Mazeppa than on many of Byron's other narrative poems, and Mazeppa does not appear in Byron texts such as the 1978 Norton critical edition. However, Byron's poem was both popular and influential in the Romantic period. It was immediately translated into French, and was a source for French Romantic painters. Plays, equestrian circus performances, musical works, novels, more poems, various visual representations, and eventually films followed, some drawing directly on Byron's work, others via intermediary works by for example Hugo or Pushkin. Publication history Byron began writing Mazeppa on 2 April 1817 and completed it on 26 September 1818. It was first published by John Murray on 28 June 1819, alongside Byron's \\"Ode to Venice\\" as \\"Ode\\" and a short prose fragment, \\"A Fragment\\", one of the earliest vampire tales in English literature.Full publication history is available in \\"A Fragment\\" was a product of the ghost story contest that took place in Geneva on 17 June 1816, when Byron stayed at the Villa Diodati with author and physician John William Polidori. Their guests were Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Godwin (later Mary Shelley), and Claire Clairmont. Mary recalled the contest and the publication of the story in the 1831 introduction to her novel Frankenstein: > 'We will each write a ghost story,' said Lord Byron; and his proposition was > acceded to. There were four of us. The noble author began a tale, a fragment > of which he printed at the end of his poem of Mazeppa.

They are located at most joints and are made up of clusters of scolopidia that either directly or indirectly connect two joints and sense their movements relative to one another. They can have both extero- and proprioceptive functions, for example sensing auditory stimuli or leg movement. The femoral chordotonal organ is thought to be functionally homologous to muscle spindles. The word was coined by Vitus Graber in 1882 though he interpreted them as being stretched between two points like a string, sensing vibrations through resonance.  Structure  Diagram of the primary components of a chordotonal organ scolopidium Chordotonal organs can be composed of a single scolopidium with only a single sensory, bipolar neuron (such as the tympanal ear of a notodontid moth), or up to several thousand scolopidia, each equipped with up to four sensory neurons (as in the mosquito Johnston's organ). The bipolar sensory neurons each have an apical dendritic structure with a cilium densely packed with microtubules and surrounded by two specialized cells, the scolopale cell and the attachment (cap) cell, plus a glial cell. Mechanically gated ion channels are located distal to the ciliary dilation, a characteristic part of the upper dendiritic cilium. The cavity between the scolopale cell and the sensory neuron is filled with a specialized receptor lymph similar to the endolymph that surrounds the mechanosensory hair bundles of cochlear hair cells (high in potassium and low in sodium). The dendritic cilia can have one of two major forms: in the mononematic form, the major connection between the attachment site and the cilium is a microtubule- rich attachment cell. The electron-dense extracellular material is small and localized mainly to the junction between the cilia and the attachment cell. The femoral chordotonal organ is mononematic. In contrast, in the amphinematic form, the extracellular material of the cap forms a dense, tubular sheath that surrounds the sensory cilium and extends all the way to the cuticle at the attachment site. In this form, the attachment cell contains both microtubules and actin-rich scolopale rods similar to those present in the scolopale cell. The Johnston's organ is an example of an amphinematic chordotonal organ. The functional significance of the morphological differences of the two forms is unknown, but may confer different viscoelastic properties on the sensory units.  Functional diversity  In a chordotonal organ, individual sensory neurons can respond to different types of mechanosensory stimuli (for example, sound vs gravity), and those that respond to a particular stimulus can have different tuning properties (for example, tuned to different position of a joint). One way to generate these functional diversity is by having sensory neurons with different types of mechanosensory channels or intrinsic properties. For example, in Johnston's organ of Drosophila melanogaster, sensory neurons that detect sound may express nompC, an ion channel that belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily, while those that detect gravity may express another member of the TRP channel, painless. Another way to generate functional diversity is by having sensory neurons that are attached to the joint through different types of connections. For example, in the femoral chordotonal organ of the locust, the ligament in which sensory neurons are embedded is divided into several strands that are sequentially pulled as the joint is flexed, providing a mechanism for differential activation of the sensory neurons at different position of the joint.  Major chordotonal organs   Femoral chordotonal organ  The femoral chordotonal organ is located in the femur of the insect leg and it detects position, speed, acceleration, and vibration of the tibia relative to the femur. In Drosophila melanogaster, where it is possible to systematically analyze neuronal populations using genetic tools, the sensory neurons of the femoral chordotonal organ can be separated into at least 3 functionally and genetically distinct populations: the club, claw, and hook. The club neurons encode bi-directional movements and vibrations of the tibia, the claw neurons encode position of the tibia, and the hook neurons encode directional movements of the tibia. Information encoded by the femoral chordotonal organ is thought to be used during behaviors that require precise control of leg movements, such as walking and target reaching. In the femoral chordotonal organ, the scolopidia are organized into groups called scoloparia. Scoloparia may be functionally distinct from one another, with separate scoloparia containing vibration-sensitive or position-sensitive sensory neurons. D. melanogaster has three scoloparia.  Johnston's organ  The chordotonal organ at the base of the antennae is called the Johnston's organ, and it detects movement of the antennae. Johnston's organ occurs in nearly all orders of insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, one population of Johnston's organ neurons has been shown to mediate the sensation of sound, whereas another population detects wind and gravity. In several species of Diptera, the Johnston's organ is sexually dimorphic. Males possess both greater numbers, greater diversity, and a more highly organized distribution of scolopidia. Some species of mosquitoes may possess as many as several thousand scolopidia. Males of these species likely use the Johnston's organ to identify potential mates.  Janet's organ  In addition to the Johnston's organ, antennae of Hymenoptera possess a second chordotonal organ, the Janet's organ, which detects flexion of the antennal joints, somewhat like the femoral chordotonal organ.  Subgenual organ  The subgenual organ is found in all insects except Diptera and Coleoptera. It is located in the proximal part of the tibia and detects high-frequency acoustic vibrations transmitted through the substrate as well as sound through air.  Tympanal organ  Tympanal organs are specialized hearing organs that have evolved in at least seven different orders of insects. They consist of a tympanal membrane backed by an air-filled space and are innervated by a chordotonal organ. Tympanal organs detect air- borne vibrations and are used to detect predators, prey, and potential mates and rivals. They can be found in a variety of locations on the body, including the abdomen, wing base, metathorax, and ventral prosternum.  Wing and halteres  There is a chordotonal organ located at the base of the wings in many insect orders, and, in Dipterans, there are also two chordotonal organs found at the base of the haltere. Their function is currently not well understood. In lacewings, a tympanal organ is located in the radius vein of the forewing and is thought to monitor ultrasound.

Modelled on the Old French chanson de geste, it was composed in two distinct parts: William of Tudela wrote the first towards 1213, and an anonymous continuator finished the account. However, recent studies have proposed the troubadour Gui de Cavalhon as the author of the second part.Saverio Guida, \\"L'autore della seconda parte della Canso de la crotzada\\", in Cultura Neolatina, LXIII, 2003, pp. 255–282. It is one of three major contemporary narratives of the Albigensian Crusade, the Historia Albigensis of Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay and the Chronica of William of Puylaurens being the others. There is a single surviving manuscript of the whole Song (fr. 25425 in the Bibliothèque nationale), written in or around Toulouse about 1275. Contents First part The first was written by William of Tudela (he names himself as \\"maestre W.\\" in laisses 1 and 9). The author also names the date of the beginning of the composition, as 1210 (laisse 9). It comprises the first 2749 lines, in 130 laisses (rhymed stanzas of varying length), and takes the story to the beginning of 1213. It is strongly partisan, in favour of the Crusaders and against their opponents, the Cathars and southerners in general. The text has the earliest use of the term crusade (as crozada). The term croiserie \\"the act of making the sign of the cross; a crusade\\" is attested for the late 12th century. A Middle Latin term for the oriental crusades was negotium crucis \\"affair of the cross\\". The Occitan crozada was adopted into French as croisade by the 15th century, and from there into English by the late 16th century. Eliza Miruna Ghil, \\"Crozada: Avatars of a Religious Term in Thirteenth Century Occitan Poetry\\", Tenso 10.2 (Spring 1995), 99-109, doi:10.1353/ten.1995.0009. Second part The second part comprises the remaining 6811 lines of the poem, in laisses 131 to 214. The author's identity is not certain, although the name of Gui de Cavalhon has been recently proposed. This second part covers events from 1213 onwards and takes the opposite point of view, critical of the Crusaders and strongly in favour of the southerners (though not of Catharism). To historians the Song is important for this whole period because it is the only major narrative source that takes the southern viewpoint; it is especially important from April 1216 to June 1219, because the prose narrative by Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay becomes more sketchy and incomplete from 1216 onwards. The author was apparently an educated man, displaying some knowledge of theology and law, and belonged to the diocese of Toulouse (since he calls bishop Folquet de Marselha \\"our bishop\\"). Michel Zink suggests that he was with Raymond VII of Toulouse in Rome and Provence during the years 1215 and 1216.M. Zink, \\"Introduction\\" (Gougaud 1992, pp. 20–22). The poet mentions the death of Guy of Montfort, which actually took place in 1228;Laisse 142, lines 7–8 it is questionable whether the whole of part 2 was written after that date, or whether the reference to Guy's death was a later insertion. Saverio Guida has proposed that Gui de Cavalhon may be the author. Gui, besides being a troubadour, was also a noble, and one of the most faithful allies of Raymond VI of Toulouse. Editions and translations The text was first edited by Claude Charles Fauriel in 1837. The first critical edition was published with a French translation, as Chanson de la croisade contre les albigeois, by Paul Meyer in two volumes (1875–1879). Eugène Martin-Chabot published another multi-volume edition and French translation under the title Chanson de la croisade albigeoise (1931–1961). Gougaud (1992) published a new single-volume French translation. An English translation was published by Shirley (1996).

It is the largest such continuous remnant in the state. The forest is located near the towns of Baradine and Narrabri and the villages of Pilliga and Gwabegar. Most land within the Pilliga is in crown tenure, either as State Forest (2,416 km2), Nature Reserve, State Conservation Area or National Park (2,770 km2). History Author Eric Rolls wrote a historic account of the Pilliga called A Million Wild Acres, which gives an insight into the history of the region. One of Rolls' most-cited conclusions is that the forest used to be an open woodland forest and that European influence has enabled the cypress pine to dominate. However, many scientific authors now disagree with much of Rolls' analysis, quoting historical records from as early as the 1870s which suggest that the plant communities in the scrub have not undergone the level of alteration that Rolls suggests.'Vegetation changes in the Pilliga forests: a preliminary evaluation of the evidence', Norris, E. H., Mitchell, P. B. and Hart, D. M., in Vegetatio V.91, pp. 209-218, 1991.'The nature of pre-European native vegetation in south-eastern Australia: a critique of Ryan, D.G., Ryan J.R and Starr, B.J.

However most of his history of the region is uncontested and his book remains an invaluable document for understanding the region. Environment Geology The geology of the area is dominated by Pilliga sandstone, a coarse red to yellow Jurassic sandstone containing about 75% quartz, 15% plagioclase and 10% iron oxide, although local variations in soil type do occur. Sandstone outcrops with basalt-capped ridges are common in the south, while the Pilliga outwash areas in the north and west are dominated by alluvium from flooding creeks. Gilgais occur in some areas. In the west \\"sand monkeys\\" (abandoned creek beds) are common. In the east is a heavily eroded sandstone mountain range, visible in outcrops such as those around Gin's Leap between Baan Baa and Boggabri. Flora and fauna The forest contains at least 900 plant species, including some now widely grown in cultivation as well as many threatened species. Some areas of the forest, particularly in the western Pilliga, are dominated by cypress-pine (Callitris spp.). However, there are a variety of distinct plant communities in the forest, some of which do not include Callitris, such as mallee and heathland. Another prominent sub- canopy genus are the she-oaks, while eucalypts dominate the canopy throughout the forest. Fauna recorded from the Pilliga Nature Reserve include at least 40 native and nine introduced mammals, 50 reptiles and at least 15 frogs. Squirrel gliders, koalas, rufous bettongs and Pilliga mice are present. =Birds= A 4,909 km2 tract of land, including the forest and the nearby Warrumbungle National Park, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of painted honeyeaters and diamond firetails. It also experiences irregular occurrences of endangered swift parrots and regent honeyeaters, and near threatened bush stone-curlews. Other declining woodland birds present in good numbers include barking owls, glossy black-cockatoos, grey-crowned babblers, speckled warblers, brown treecreepers, hooded robins and turquoise parrots.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Pilliga. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-09-18. Fires Fire plays a major role in the ecology of the forest with many plant species depending on fire to regenerate. However, in unfavorable conditions fire can be extremely intense, spread very quickly and threaten nearby properties as well as laying waste to entire ecosystems. If intense fires occur less than 15 years apart there can be a loss of plant and animal biodiversity. The magnitude of historical Pilliga bushfires correlates extremely well with the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomena, with El Nino (dry) years having the most severe fires. In 1997 a major fire burned close to 1,435 km2 of the forest. An extremely dry winter and spring in 2006 saw a number of large fires develop, including the Pilliga 4 Fire in November/December which burned out 740 km2 on just its first day. Access and attractions Towns in the area include Narrabri, Pilliga, Gwabegar, Baradine, Coonabarabran, Boggabri and Baan Baa. There is an extensive network of roads throughout the scrub, many of which are former forestry roads. The forest once supported a large forestry industry in the surrounding towns (harvesting mostly cypress pine and ironbarks) however this has been greatly scaled back since 2005 when much of the forest was set aside for environmental conservation by the NSW government. There are many attractions in the forest, including: * Sculptures in the Scrub: A series of Sculptures along the Dandry Gorge * Salt caves: shallow sandstone caves in the middle of the Pilliga.

Zinc finger domains can be engineered to target specific desired DNA sequences and this enables zinc-finger nucleases to target unique sequences within complex genomes. By taking advantage of endogenous DNA repair machinery, these reagents can be used to precisely alter the genomes of higher organisms. Alongside CRISPR/Cas9 and TALEN, ZFN is a prominent tool in the field of genome editing. Domains  DNA-binding domain  The DNA-binding domains of individual ZFNs typically contain between three and six individual zinc finger repeats and can each recognize between 9 and 18 basepairs. If the zinc finger domains perfectly recognize a 3 basepair DNA sequence, they can generate a 3-finger array that can recognize a 9 basepair target site. Other procedures can utilize either 1-finger or 2-finger modules to generate zinc- finger arrays with six or more individual zinc fingers. The main drawback with this procedure is the specificities of individual zinc fingers can overlap and can depend on the context of the surrounding zinc fingers and DNA. Without methods to account for this \\"context dependence\\", the standard modular assembly procedure often fails unless it is used to recognize sequences of the form (GNN)N. Numerous selection methods have been used to generate zinc-finger arrays capable of targeting desired sequences. Initial selection efforts utilized phage display to select proteins that bound a given DNA target from a large pool of partially randomized zinc-finger arrays. More recent efforts have utilized yeast one-hybrid systems, bacterial one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems, and mammalian cells. A promising new method to select novel zinc- finger arrays utilizes a bacterial two-hybrid system and has been dubbed \\"OPEN\\" by its creators. This system combines pre-selected pools of individual zinc fingers that were each selected to bind a given triplet and then utilizes a second round of selection to obtain 3-finger arrays capable of binding a desired 9-bp sequence. This system was developed by the Zinc-Finger Consortium as an alternative to commercial sources of engineered zinc-finger arrays. (see: Zinc finger chimera for more info on zinc finger selection techniques)  DNA-cleavage domain  A pair of ZFNs, each with three zinc fingers binding to target DNA, are shown introducing a double-strand break, at the FokI domain, depicted in yellow. Subsequently, the double strand break is shown as being repaired through either homology-directed repair or non- homologous end joining. The non-specific cleavage domain from the type IIs restriction endonuclease FokI is typically used as the cleavage domain in ZFNs. This cleavage domain must dimerize in order to cleave DNA and thus a pair of ZFNs are required to target non-palindromic DNA sites. Standard ZFNs fuse the cleavage domain to the C-terminus of each zinc finger domain. To let the two cleavage domains dimerize and cleave DNA, the two individual ZFNs must bind opposite strands of DNA with their C-termini a certain distance apart. The most commonly used linker sequences between the zinc finger domain and the cleavage domain requires the 5' edge of each binding site to be separated by 5 to 7 bp. Several different protein engineering techniques have been employed to improve both the activity and specificity of the nuclease domain used in ZFNs. Directed evolution has been employed to generate a FokI variant with enhanced cleavage activity that the authors dubbed \\"Sharkey\\". Structure-based design has also been employed to improve the cleavage specificity of FokI by modifying the dimerization interface so that only the intended heterodimeric species are active.  Applications  Zinc finger nucleases are useful to manipulate the genomes of many plants and animals including arabidopsis, tobacco, soybean, corn, Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, Platynereis dumerilii, sea urchin, silkworm, zebrafish, frogs, mice, rats, rabbits, pigs, cattle, and various types of mammalian cells. Zinc finger nucleases have also been used in a mouse model of haemophilia and a clinical trial found CD4+ human T-cells with the CCR5 gene disrupted by zinc finger nucleases to be safe as a potential treatment for HIV/AIDS. ZFNs are also used to create a new generation of genetic disease models called isogenic human disease models.  Disabling an allele  ZFNs can be used to disable dominant mutations in heterozygous individuals by producing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA (see Genetic recombination) in the mutant allele, which will, in the absence of a homologous template, be repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). NHEJ repairs DSBs by joining the two ends together and usually produces no mutations, provided that the cut is clean and uncomplicated. In some instances, however, the repair is imperfect, resulting in deletion or insertion of base-pairs, producing frame-shift and preventing the production of the harmful protein. Multiple pairs of ZFNs can also be used to completely remove entire large segments of genomic sequence. To monitor the editing activity, a PCR of the target area amplifies both alleles and, if one contains an insertion, deletion, or mutation, it results in a heteroduplex single- strand bubble that cleavage assays can easily detect. ZFNs have also been used to modify disease-causing alleles in triplet repeat disorders. Expanded CAG/CTG repeat tracts are the genetic basis for more than a dozen inherited neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy, and several spinocerebellar ataxias. It has been demonstrated in human cells that ZFNs can direct double-strand breaks (DSBs) to CAG repeats and shrink the repeat from long pathological lengths to short, less toxic lengths. Recently, a group of researchers have successfully applied the ZFN technology to genetically modify the gol pigment gene and the ntl gene in zebrafish embryo. Specific zinc-finger motifs were engineered to recognize distinct DNA sequences. The ZFN-encoding mRNA was injected into one-cell embryos and a high percentage of animals carried the desired mutations and phenotypes. Their research work demonstrated that ZFNs can specifically and efficiently create heritable mutant alleles at loci of interest in the germ line, and ZFN-induced alleles can be propagated in subsequent generations. Similar research of using ZFNs to create specific mutations in zebrafish embryo has also been carried out by other research groups. The kdr gene in zebra fish encodes for the vascular endothelial growth factor-2 receptor. Mutagenic lesions at this target site was induced using ZFN technique by a group of researchers in US. They suggested that the ZFN technique allows straightforward generation of a targeted allelic series of mutants; it does not rely on the existence of species-specific embryonic stem cell lines and is applicable to other vertebrates, especially those whose embryos are easily available; finally, it is also feasible to achieve targeted knock-ins in zebrafish, therefore it is possible to create human disease models that are heretofore inaccessible.  Allele editing  ZFNs are also used to rewrite the sequence of an allele by invoking the homologous recombination (HR) machinery to repair the DSB using the supplied DNA fragment as a template. The HR machinery searches for homology between the damaged chromosome and the extra-chromosomal fragment and copies the sequence of the fragment between the two broken ends of the chromosome, regardless of whether the fragment contains the original sequence. If the subject is homozygous for the target allele, the efficiency of the technique is reduced since the undamaged copy of the allele may be used as a template for repair instead of the supplied fragment. Gene therapy The success of gene therapy depends on the efficient insertion of therapeutic genes at the appropriate chromosomal target sites within the human genome, without causing cell injury, oncogenic mutations or an immune response. The construction of plasmid vectors is simple and straightforward. Custom-designed ZFNs that combine the non-specific cleavage domain (N) of FokI endonuclease with zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) offer a general way to deliver a site- specific DSB to the genome, and stimulate local homologous recombination by several orders of magnitude. This makes targeted gene correction or genome editing a viable option in human cells. Since ZFN-encoding plasmids could be used to transiently express ZFNs to target a DSB to a specific gene locus in human cells, they offer an excellent way for targeted delivery of the therapeutic genes to a pre-selected chromosomal site. The ZFN-encoding plasmid-based approach has the potential to circumvent all the problems associated with the viral delivery of therapeutic genes. The first therapeutic applications of ZFNs are likely to involve ex vivo therapy using a patients own stem cells. After editing the stem cell genome, the cells could be expanded in culture and reinserted into the patient to produce differentiated cells with corrected functions. Initial targets likely include the causes of monogenic diseases, such as the IL2Rγ gene and the b-globin gene for gene correction and CCR5 gene for mutagenesis and disablement.  Potential problems   Off-target cleavage  If the zinc finger domains are not specific enough for their target site or they do not target a unique site within the genome of interest, off-target cleavage may occur. Such off-target cleavage may lead to the production of enough double-strand breaks to overwhelm the repair machinery and, as a consequence, yield chromosomal rearrangements and/or cell death. Off-target cleavage events may also promote random integration of donor DNA. Two separate methods have been demonstrated to decrease off-target cleavage for 3-finger ZFNs that target two adjacent 9-basepair sites. . Other groups use ZFNs with 4, 5 or 6 zinc fingers that target longer and presumably rarer sites and such ZFNs could theoretically yield less off-target activity. A comparison of a pair of 3-finger ZFNs and a pair of 4-finger ZFNs detected off-target cleavage in human cells at 31 loci for the 3-finger ZFNs and at 9 loci for the 4-finger ZFNs. Whole genome sequencing of C. elegans modified with a pair of 5-finger ZFNs found only the intended modification and a deletion at a site \\"unrelated to the ZFN site\\" indicating this pair of ZFNs was capable of targeting a unique site in the C. elegans genome.  Immunogenicity  As with many foreign proteins inserted into the human body, there is a risk of an immunological response against the therapeutic agent and the cells in which it is active. Since the protein must be expressed only transiently, however, the time over which a response may develop is short. Liu et al. respectively target ZFNickases to the endogenous b-casein(CSN2) locus stimulates lysostaphin and human lysozyme gene addition by homology-directed repair and derive secrete lysostaphin cows.  Prospects  The ability to precisely manipulate the genomes of plants and animals has numerous applications in basic research, agriculture, and human therapeutics. Using ZFNs to modify endogenous genes has traditionally been a difficult task due mainly to the challenge of generating zinc finger domains that target the desired sequence with sufficient specificity. Improved methods of engineering zinc finger domains and the availability of ZFNs from a commercial supplier now put this technology in the hands of increasing numbers of researchers. Several groups are also developing other types of engineered nucleases including engineered homing endonucleases and nucleases based on engineered TAL effectors. TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) are particularly interesting because TAL effectors appear to be very simple to engineer and TALENs can be used to target endogenous loci in human cells. But to date no one has reported the isolation of clonal cell lines or transgenic organisms using such reagents. One type of ZFN, known as SB-728-T, has been tested for potential application in the treatment of HIV.  Zinc-finger nickases  Zinc-finger nickases (ZFNickases) are created by inactivating the catalytic activity of one ZFN monomer in the ZFN dimer required for double-strand cleavage. ZFNickases demonstrate strand-specific nicking activity in vitro and thus provide for highly specific single-strand breaks in DNA. These SSBs undergo the same cellular mechanisms for DNA that ZFNs exploit, but they show a significantly reduced frequency of mutagenic NHEJ repairs at their target nicking site. This reduction provides a bias for HR-mediated gene modifications. ZFNickases can induce targeted HR in cultured human and livestock cells, although at lower levels than corresponding ZFNs from which they were derived because nicks can be repaired without genetic alteration. A major limitation of ZFN-mediated gene modifications is the competition between NHEJ and HR repair pathways. Regardless of the presence of a DNA donor construct, both repair mechanisms can be activated following DSBs induced by ZFNs. Thus, ZFNickases is the first plausible attempt at engineering a method to favor the HR method of DNA repair as opposed to the error-prone NHEJ repair. By reducing NHEJ repairs, ZFNickases can thereby reduce the spectrum of unwanted off-target alterations. The ease by which ZFNickases can be derive from ZFNs provides a great platform for further studies regarding the optimization of ZFNickases and possibly increasing their levels of targeted HR while still maintain their reduced NHEJ frequency.

He was best known for creating the German Reed Entertainments, together with his actress wife, a genre of musical plays that made theatre-going respectable at a time when the stage was considered disreputable. While acting as organist and chapel-master at chapels in London, and also as musical director and performer at West End theatres in the 1830s and 1840s, Reed tried his hand at producing opera. He married Priscilla Horton, a noted singer, actress and dancer, in 1844. By 1851, he was managing opera productions at various theatres in London and on tour. In 1855, Reed and his wife began to present and perform in \\"Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments\\", consisting of brief, small-scale, family- friendly comic operas. In the early and mid-Victorian era, the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful. Therefore, the Reeds shrewdly called their establishment the \\"Gallery of Illustration\\" and their productions \\"entertainments\\" to emphasize their refined propriety. In addition to comic classics like The Beggar's Opera, the Reeds usually presented new works by English writers such as F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert, William Brough and Gilbert à Beckett. His composers included Frederic Clay, Arthur Sullivan, George Macfarren and Alfred Cellier, as well as himself. Reed retired in 1871 after an injury, and his son Alfred took over the entertainments with his mother. Life and career Reed was born in Bristol, the son of Thomas Reed (1795–1871), a musician, and his wife, Frances, née German (1796–1839). He studied music with his father and made his debut at the age of ten as a pianist and singer at the Bath Theatre.Stedman, Jane W. \\"Reed, (Thomas) German (1817–1888)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, Jan 2008, accessed 1 February 2013 The family moved to London where Thomas Reed was appointed conductor at the Haymarket Theatre.Woodbridge Wilson, Frederic. \\"Reed, Thomas German\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 31 January 2013 The young Reed played, sang and acted at the theatre. In 1832, German Reed became an organist at the Roman Catholic Chapel in Sloane Street and assistant to his father, who moved to be conductor at the Garrick Theatre. His work at the theatre included scoring and adapting new operas, including Fra Diavolo in 1837. He also gave private music lessons. German Reed and W. S. Gilbert's A Sensation Novel, 1871 In 1838, Reed was appointed chapel-master at the Royal Bavarian Chapel and also became musical director at his father's former employer, the Haymarket Theatre, where he continued to work until 1851 with the exception of a temporary closure in 1843, during which he produced Pacini's opera Sappho at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. During these years, he met Priscilla Horton, a successful and popular contralto and actress who had been performing on the stage in London since the age of ten. They married in 1844. By that year he had dropped his first name. In 1851, Reed was engaged to assist in the production of opera at the Surrey Theatre and later managed Sadler's Wells Opera for a season and also conducted the music at the Olympic Theatre, as well as touring extensively in the British provinces. In the spring of 1855, at St. Martin's Hall, Reed and his wife presented the first performance of \\"Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings,\\" musical theatre. These performances usually consisted of one or two brief comic operas designed for a minimal number of characters and performed with either the piano and harmonium or a small ensemble of musicians. They eventually became \\"Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments\\", presented at the Royal Gallery of Illustration in Regent Street, beginning in 1856, and later at St. George's Hall. At a time when the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful and even dangerous places of naughty humour, alcohol and prostitution, the Reeds called their establishment the \\"Gallery\\" of Illustration, rather than a \\"theatre\\", and their productions \\"entertainments\\" or \\"illustrative gatherings\\", rather than plays, extravaganzas, or burlesques. The Times characterised the works as \\"extravaganza of the more refined order.\\"\\"Obituary\\" The Times, 26 March 1888, p. 9 Reed and his wife almost always appeared in these pieces, and on the few occasions when they did not, the box-office receipts suffered. John Parry and Susan Galton in A Dream in Venice at the Royal Gallery of Illustration, April 1867. Reed became the lessee of St. George's Hall in 1867, and there he initially produced and conducted The Contrabandista by Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand, The Beggar's Opera and other English operas in small-scale productions, as well as non-musical plays. Around the same time, at the Gallery of Illustration, he presented works with libretti by, among others, W. S. Gilbert, William Brough, Gilbert à Beckett, Robert Reece and Arthur Law. His composers included Frederic Clay, George Macfarren, Alfred Cellier and Hamilton Clarke as well as Sullivan and Reed himself. He wrote the scores for more than a dozen of the entertainments, and is described by the museum curator Fredric Woodbridge Wilson as \\"an imaginative and effective writer of music for the stage\\". Little of Reed's music survives. A few individual songs were published, but the scores of the entertainments were not. The autograph of the music for Our Island Home is preserved in The Morgan Library & Museum, New York, but no other scores are known to be extant. When the lease on the Gallery of Illustration ended in 1873, the German Reed entertainments moved to St. George's Hall. After falling from his horse when hunting, Reed had retired in 1871; his son Alfred (1847–1895) took over the entertainments with his mother, continuing with the entertainments after her retirement in 1879, until 1895. Reed died at St. Croix, Upper East Sheen, Surrey at the age of 70. He was buried in Old Mortlake Burial Ground.

Canadian multichannel television providers are legally referred to as broadcast distribution undertakings (BDUs). They must be licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and comply with its policies, including those on the packaging of their services. Additionally, the CRTC licenses specialty channels; licensing was previously mandatory for all services, and restrictions were placed on their content in order to discourage direct competition in certain categories. The CRTC began to phase out these policies by the 2010s, and in 2012, it began exempting networks with less than 200,000 subscribers, as well as certain ethnic services not broadcasting in Canada's official or indigenous languages, from formal licensing. As per its New Media exemption order, the CRTC does not regulate internet television or video content delivered over the public internet, such as over-the-top subscription services. Some of the CRTC's policies in regard to multichannel television are intended to protect and encourage the production of Canadian content, and prevent foreign broadcasters from unduly harming domestic outlets. U.S. and international channels can be authorized for distribution in Canada if they are deemed to not be unduly competitive to Canadian outlets (although their programming may be affected by differing broadcast rights). Affiliates of the U.S. ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and PBS networks are also readily available in Canada, but their programming is subject to a CRTC rule known as simultaneous substitution (or simsub), which gives Canadian broadcast stations within a viewer's market the right to require that U.S. feeds of programs be substituted by BDUs with their own if they are broadcasting the same program in simulcast. This rule serves to protect Canadian advertising revenue. The majority of Canada's multichannel television industry is dominated by vertically integrated companies and their respective services, including Bell Canada's Bell Satellite TV satellite and fibreoptic Fibe TV IPTV services, Rogers Communications' cable systems (primarily in Ontario and Atlantic Canada), Shaw Communications' cable systems (primarily in Western Canada; the Shaw family also owns Corus Entertainment, a major operator of Canadian specialty channels), and Vidéotron (which operates mainly in its home province of Quebec, and is owned by local conglomerate Quebecor). Platforms Cable television =History= In 1949, the Broadcast Relay Service began negotiations for the implementation of what was to be the first large scale cable television system in North America. The development of the system relied on reaching an agreement with the Quebec Hydro-Electric Commission to utilise their existing network of power poles supplying power to the Montreal metropolitan area. Initial discussions began with a meeting with the Montreal City Council on June 21, 1949. After many months of negotiation, an agreement was reached between Hydro Quebec and Rediffusion Inc. on February 28, 1950 for an initial five-year period. The Rediffusion cable system began operation in 1952, and eventually supplied 80,000 homes in Montreal, Quebec. Cable television in Canada began in 1952 with community antenna connections in Vancouver and London; as to which city was first to launch such a service is not clear. Initially, the systems brought American stations to viewers in Canada who had no Canadian stations to watch; broadcast television, though begun late in 1952 in Toronto and Montreal, did not reach a majority of cities until 1954. In time, cable television was widely established to carry available Canadian stations as well as import American stations, which constituted the vast majority of signals on systems (usually only one or two Canadian stations, while some systems had duplicate or even triplicate coverage of American networks). During the 1970s, a growing number of Canadian stations pushed American channels off the systems, forcing several to expand beyond the original 12-channel system configurations. At the same time, the advent of fibre-optic technology enabled companies to extend their systems to nearby towns and villages that by themselves were not viable cable television markets. In 1977-78, regional cable services such Telecable and Cable Regina in Saskatchewan began to emerge, offering access to American networks for the first time, though a third system, CPN, which offered specialty channels such as HBO, failed after two years. Specialty television channels available only on cable began to be established in 1983, and systems continued to expand and upgrade their channel capacity, notably by deploying fibre-optics to carry signals as far as neighbourhoods before converting to coaxial cable for the final run to the customer premises. The use of fibre optic cables as far back as the 1970s does not imply that cable companies were using digital methods to transmit signals as is sometimes assumed by the modern viewer, this is a common misunderstanding. Methods were developed and deployed as far back as the 1970s to transmit analog video using frequency division multiplexing via fibre-optic cabling. Digital signaling is a much more modern practice which only began in the early 2000s. Two-way capabilities were introduced, and larger systems were able to use \\"addressable\\" descramblers to offer pay television services and different tiers of channels. Cable television began to face serious competition from DTH satellite services in the late 1990s. Telephone companies and cable television providers have since been permitted, in most parts of Canada, to compete to provide services originally provided by the other. Cable television services are not the prime providers of broadband Internet in Canada, but they are a very strong competitor for the service. During the early 1970s, Canadian television stations obtained regulatory rulings that required cable television operators to substitute their signals for distant (usually American) stations carrying the same television program at the same time. This was to protect the stations' advertising sales. Many systems were originally locally owned, and many large cities had several providers each covering specific sections of a city; sometimes these territories were established by a \\"gentleman's agreement\\" between system owners. Hamilton, Ontario, had six different operators. London had two, with a very convoluted dividing line in the old south neighbourhood; Rogers eventually bought the companies that ran those two systems, merging them, a pattern repeated elsewhere. Even before mergers, companies in the same community collaborated to operate the community channel. A long series of consolidations and acquisitions rapidly brought most major cities' systems under the ownership of a small number of large companies. Some of the largest companies even applied for regulator permission to swap systems in order to consolidate their operations: Shaw sold systems in eastern Canada to Rogers, buying Rogers systems in western Canada. Presently, cable is provided to most cities and towns, depending on the region, by companies such as Rogers, Shaw, Vidéotron, Cogeco, Cable Axion, and EastLink. Most of these \\"first-generation\\" cable companies do not compete with each other, as the CRTC has traditionally licensed only one cable provider per market. Even in markets where more than one distributor has been licensed, each has an exclusive territory within the market.  IPTV  In the early 2000s, IPTV services began to emerge in some markets as an alternative to digital cable. IPTV service is typically delivered over a private, internet protocol network using a phone company's copper or fibre to the home infrastructure, and offers a similar user experience and features to a digital cable service. IPTV has seen wide adoption in Western Canada; Saskatchewan's government-owned telecom SaskTel was the first provider in Canada to launch an IPTV service, followed by Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS) in 2004, and later Telus in Alberta and British Columbia. Bell Canada has offered IPTV, first in Atlantic Canada, and later in metropolitan Ontario and Quebec, and Manitoba (following its purchase of MTS), under the Bell Fibe TV brand. IPTV services have also been launched by smaller regional providers such as Vmedia. Satellite television In Canada, the two legal DBS services available are Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission has refused to license American satellite services, but nonetheless hundreds of thousands (up to a million by some estimates) of Canadians access or have accessed American services – usually these services have to be billed to an American address and are paid for in U.S. dollars, although many viewers receive American signals through pirate decryption. Whether such activity is grey market or black market is the source of often heated debate between those who would like greater choice and those who argue that the protection of Canadian firms and Canadian culture is more important. Canadian satellite providers continue to be plagued by the unquestionably black market devices which \\"pirate\\" or \\"steal\\" their signals as well as by a number of otherwise completely lawful devices which can be reprogrammed to receive pirated television signals. Karl Péladeau, CEO of Québecor (which owns cable television provider Vidéotron) is on public record as demanding conditions be placed on the CRTC license issued to Bell Satellite TV, due to Bell TV’s reputation for vastly inferior security compared to its cable rivals and Shaw Cable-owned Shaw Direct. Although there are no official statistics, the use of American satellite services in Canada appears to be declining as of 2004. Some would claim that this is probably due to a combination of increasingly aggressive police enforcement and an unfavourable exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. currencies. As the U.S. dollar has been declining as of 2005 versus other international currencies, the decline in DirecTV viewership in Canada may well be related not to a cost difference as much as to the series of smart card swaps which have rendered the first three generations of DirecTV access cards (F, H and HU) all obsolete. Other platforms In some areas, an additional option is a form of over-the-air broadcasting, either via a multichannel multipoint distribution service, also known as \\"wireless cable\\", or via encrypted low-power transmissions in the NTSC format. This type of distribution is most commonly used in the territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut), which are too sparsely populated to make conventional cable a financially viable operation. The fate of such capacity- limited services, heading into the era of digital television, is uncertain. Subscribers (2017 Q1) # BCE Inc. (2.734 million) # Shaw (2.507 million) # Rogers (1.796 million) # Vidéotron (1.722 million) # Telus (1.070 million) # Cogeco (0.738 million) Total: 10.526 millionCommunications Monitoring Report 2017: Broadcasting distribution sector - Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Programming Specialty channels Most specialty channels (legally known as \\"programming undertakings\\", or \\"discretionary services\\"), unlike their counterparts in the U.S., must be licensed by the CRTC. These services were previously divided into four categories: * Category A services – services that must be offered by all digital television service providers, in one or more discretionary service tiers. Category A services were subject to high Canadian content requirements, and were previously protected by \\"genre protection\\" rules which barred other channels from broadcasting programming formats deemed to be directly competitive with them. Certain Category A services were only subject to mandatory carriage in certain regions; for example, most French language Category A services were only mandatory in Quebec, and could be carried on a discretionary basis outside of the province. Since 2011, Category A also contained the previous \\"dual-status\\" and \\"modified dual-status\\" channels for mandatory and discretionary carriage on analog cable television services. Examples of Category A services included Cottage Life, Discovery Channel, Showcase, Sportsnet 360, VisionTV, and YTV. * Category B services – channels with no mandatory carriage in digital-service discretionary packages, and have lighter Canadian content regulations. Examples of Category B services include Animal Planet, Cooking Channel, Family Chrgd, MovieTime, and World Fishing Network. ** Exempted Category B services - In December 2012, the CRTC exempted from formal licensing services with less than 200,000 subscribers that would otherwise meet the definition of a Category B service from formal licensing, as well as services which air 90% of their programming in a language other than English, French, or languages of Canadian aboriginal peoples. * Category C services – services that are mainstream sports or news services. This category was created to provide standardized conditions of license to mainstream sports and news channels (thus exempting them from the previous genre protection rules). Category C news channels services have mandatory carriage in the \\"best available discretionary package consistent with their genre and programming\\" or as a stand-alone service. This includes Canada's two major sports network groups (Sportsnet and TSN), as well as all of Canada's national news channels. * Exempt – Certain types of services are exempt from CRTC licensing, such as channels whose content consist purely of text and graphics without video content, and channels which consist of only teleshopping and/or infomercials. All specialty channels were subject to \\"genre protection\\" rules which prevented them from directly competing against Category A services with a similar format. For example, to protect TSN, The Score (now Sportsnet 360) was specifically licensed to serve as a sports news service (instead of a mainstream, national sports network), and was limited in the amount of live programming it could air. However, following inquiries into the matter, the CRTC announced in 2009 that it would begin to allow leeway in certain broader categories, such as news and sports. To prevent them from airing programming from outside their designated format, the CRTC employed a system of \\"program categories\\", specifying how much of a service's weekly programming could be devoted to specific genres and classes of programming. As part of \\"Let's Talk TV\\", an initiative to implement reforms of Canada's broadcasting industry, the CRTC announced in 2015 that it planned to phase out the genre protection rules and Category A licensing by 2017 for larger conglomerates, and 2018 for independent broadcasters. The CRTC cited new regulations on how television providers must package their services—including a mandate to offer \\"pick and pay\\" purchasing of individual channels by December 2016, and a future requirement for vertically-integrated providers to offer a service owned by a third-party for each co-owned service they offer; the Commission felt that these restrictions were \\"no longer needed to ensure programming diversity between services\\", as \\"[they] limited programming services to offering certain types of programming and precluded other services from offering that programming.\\" Under the standardized conditions of license for discretionary services introduced by the CRTC in November 2016, the only significant restriction is that channels not licensed as sports channels may not dedicate more than 10% of programming per-month to \\"live professional sports\\" programming. Foreign channels In addition to these specialty channels, certain foreign channels, most commonly American cable networks such as CNN and Spike, are permitted. In general, foreign channels are permitted provided that they are deemed not to directly compete with Canadian channels at the time of their introduction. In rejecting a 2003 application proposing the addition of several U.S.-based channels, the CRTC stated that by allowing Canadian channels to maintain control over these types of programming, they are able to fully access the available advertising and subscription revenues, which would otherwise flow outside the country, in order to fund Canadian programming.Letter to the Canadian Cable Television Association, CRTC website, November 7, 2003 Examples of well-known U.S. channels not permitted in Canada include FX, Nickelodeon, ESPN, HBO, Showtime, USA Network and TNT (however, Canadian broadcasters have since launched licensed versions of FX, HBO and Nickelodeon, while TSN is minority-owned by ESPN); nonetheless some Canadians choose to subscribe to these channels via the grey market, as outlined above. Although it is not an approved foreign cable channel, TBS was also available in Canada until 2007 via the superstation WTBS (now WPCH-TV). The commission is also permitted to revoke a foreign channel's status should another channel launch within the same genre. However, the only time the CRTC has unilaterally removed an American channel from the eligible services list – that is, without the consent of the American broadcaster – was at the launch of New Country Network, when the American channel CMT was removed. This led to a protracted dispute eventually resolved by the sale of a stake in NCN (now CMT Canada) to CMT. Since then, the CRTC has been more lenient on existing eligible channels; Spike and Comedy Central have retained their eligibility despite the launch of mentv and Comedy. Even if a channel is approved, other issues such as programming rights may prevent their carriage, as in the cases of Comedy Central and, until late 2006, AMC and TCM. U.S. cable networks are not subject to the same simsub rules as American broadcast stations. However, unlike the broadcast stations, cable networks must own all applicable programming rights, and may be forced to provide alternate programming if they do not. For example, even though NBC's Olympic Games and NHL coverage is available in Canada via U.S. affiliates, broadcasts of these programs on cable networks such as CNBC are normally blacked out and replaced with alternate programming, in deference to the respective rights of CBC or Rogers Media. Premium services \\"Pay television\\" services were launched in Canada in the early 1980s but were largely unsuccessful in their original form. Many shut down, and two (TSN and MuchMusic) converted to specialty services as that format became more successful. However, movie-oriented premium services, including English-language The Movie Network and French-language Super Écran (which are both divisions of Bell Media), have become very successful and very profitable, more so in recent years thanks to the shift towards digital television and the success of original series from sources such as HBO. The Movie Network, along with a secondary service known as Movie Central, were granted monopoly positions, with each having exclusivity in the eastern and western half of Canada respectively. The two services were joined by Super Channel, a national premium service led by the original owners of Movie Central, in 2007. Movie Central was wound down in 2016, with The Movie Network replacing Movie Central nationwide. Many third-language or \\"ethnic\\" services are mostly treated as premium services by cable and satellite operators, and sold separately from mainstream packages. Family Channel was previously licensed as a pay service and thus commercial-free, but was typically treated as and bundled with other specialty channels by television providers. As part of its \\"Let's Talk TV\\" initiative, the CRTC proposed that the legal distinction between premium and specialty services be removed, and replaced by a single, unified category known as Discretionary services. DHX Media, owner of Family Channel, argued that with the ongoing deregulation of specialty services and the removal the genre protection rules, Family would be at a disadvantage in comparison to other specialty channels because of its inability to air traditional commercial advertising. These changes were officially approved by the CRTC on November 2, 2016. Cable/satellite packaging Under CRTC regulations as of March 2016, the lowest tier of service of a digital broadcast distribution undertaking must include: * all national CRTC-licensed networks, specifically CBC Television, Ici Radio-Canada Télé, TVA and APTN; * all local or regional broadcasters, usually including stations/affiliates of CTV and Global, and (where applicable) Citytv, CTV Two, V, and provincial educational broadcasters such as TVOntario, Télé-Québec, or Knowledge Network (B.C.). Satellite providers carry most but not all local stations, and, unlike their U.S. equivalents, out-of-market stations may be carried nationally. * A local channel broadcasting the proceedings of the provincial legislature (if one exists). * All undertakings that are subject to 9(1)(h) orders. This designation is used sparingly by the CRTC, and is reserved specifically for services that show an \\"exceptional contribution\\" to Canada's broadcasting system. Some of these services only have must-carry status in English or French-speaking markets, and can be carried on a discretionary basis in predominantly French or English markets respectively. However, the majority are mandatory nationwide regardless of language. Examples of these services include: ** The Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, a broadcaster serving Canada's First Nations communities. ** AMI-tv and AMI-télé, which provide accessible programming with audio descriptions in English and French. ** The radio reading service AMI-audio in anglophone markets, or Canal M in francophone markets. ** CPAC, which broadcasts parliamentary sessions and committee meetings, along with some political public affairs programming. ** Omni Regional, a specialty service relaying Omni Television stations serving ethnic communities. ** The Weather Network in anglophone markets and MétéoMédia in francophone markets. ** The French- language networks TV5 Québec Canada and Unis in Anglophone markets. * Ici RDI in anglophone markets, and CBC News Network in francophone markets. * Cable providers are also required to carry at least one CBC Radio station in each language, as well as any local campus, community or native radio stations. The requirement to carry all stations was removed by the CRTC in 2006.Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2006-119 , 8 September 2006 At the same time the commission stated that this requirement did not, and would not, force cable companies to provide these stations via cable FM receivers, provided they were available as channels on the digital service.Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2006-51 , 19 April 2006; see para. 26 The basic package described above must be sold at a maximum rate of $25 per-month. A higher-tiered basic package typically adds: * Common basic cable specialty channels, such as news channels (including Canadian networks, and U.S. services such as CNN), Much, and YTV among others. * A community channel, featuring locally-produced public affairs and information programming, and coverage of other local events. * American broadcast network affiliates. These are carried under a \\"4 + 1\\" rule, meaning that a cable company may offer stations affiliated with any four American commercial networks and PBS on a basic tier. In most markets, the five networks provided are ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and PBS, although in many markets Fox is carried on a modified dual-status rather than a basic tier. Other networks, such as The CW and MyNetworkTV, can only be offered on a discretionary tier; generally they are offered through the packaging of American superstations, such as KTLA, WSBK-TV, and WPIX-TV (along with independent superstation WGN- TV, which left The CW in 2016), with pay television services. However, cable providers in border markets within the broadcast range of a major American television market, such as Windsor, may be granted an exemption to the 4 + 1 rule to improve the marketability of their service (for example, Cogeco Cable systems in Windsor carry Detroit's WKBD-TV and WMYD). * Timeshift channels, including east and west coast feeds of certain specialty channels, and Canadian/U.S. network affiliates from cities in different time zones (such as markets in the Eastern Time Zone and Pacific Time Zone). * \\"exempt\\" services such as The Shopping Channel, program guides, and real estate/classifieds channels. * A digital radio service, offering local radio stations, and the national specialty radio service Stingray Music. Other \\"discretionary tiers\\" or packages include other Canadian specialty or premium services and foreign services, as noted above. The distribution of these services is covered by various regulations, including one that states that a package cannot consist exclusively of foreign services and must maintain a certain ratio of Canadian to foreign services. Additionally, if the service provider is the owner of a channel, the service must offer three channels owned by third-parties for each co-owned channel they carry. On March 19, 2015, the CRTC announced new policies on the packaging of television services. Since March 2016, all television services have been required to offer a basic service (\\"skinny basic\\") consisting of all local Canadian broadcast television channels, local legislative and educational services, and all specialty services that have 9(1)(h) must-carry status, costing a maximum of $25 per-month. The tier may optionally include U.S. network affiliates. Since December 1, 2016, all television providers are required to allow subscribers to purchase channels on an individual (a la carte) basis.

Dance wrote several hit musicals, including The Gay Parisienne (1894) and A Chinese Honeymoon (1899), one of the most successful musicals in history until the 1940s. In the early years of the 20th century, he became one of the most successful theatrical managers in the United Kingdom, managing many productions both on the West End and on tour. Biography Dance was born in Nottingham, England, the son of Isaac Dance (1824–1880) a pipe maker. Dance was educated at the National School, Sneinton, Nottingham. He married Grace Spong in 1898, and the couple produced two sons (Eric and James) and a daughter (Phyllis, later Mrs. Bertram Merritt).The Times Deaths, 27 October 1932, p. 15, col.

He then became one of the most successful theatrical managers in the United Kingdom, often having as many as 24 companies on tour at once. He was behind the scenes financially at many of the big West End theatres in the days preceding the World War I, including the Adelphi Theatre, the Gaiety Theatre, London, Daly's Theatre and the Prince of Wales Theatre. He also directed theatre companies at the Alhambra Theatre and the Kingsway Theatre and many Stoll Theatres Corporation productions. Dance was knighted in 1923 in recognition of his services to the theatre, which included a gift of £30,000 for the reconstruction of the Old Vic and stabilisation of that theatre as a permanent Shakespeare repertory theatre.

He was also the 7th generation successor of the Zhaobao style of Tai Chi. He was an influential martial artist and teacher of taijiquan (t'ai chi ch'uan). He was married to a woman from the Zhaobao village, only a few miles north east of the Chen Village (Chenjiagou); the home of the Chen Family famous for their martial arts. He has also been said to have learned the small-frame Chen style developed by Chen Youben, but no evidence exists to support this assertion. After moving to the Zhaobao Village, Chen Qingping learned Zhaobao taijiquan from Zhang Yan (), who was the 6th generation master of the Zhaobao Tai Chi lineage. Due to the difficulty of mastering any one style of Tai Chi, and given the fact that Zhang Yan was said to have praised one of Chen Qingping's best students, He Zhaoyuan, it seems clear that Chen Qingping taught Zhaobao Tai Chi in more or less a pure form His main disciple He Zhaoyuan passed on this art which later developed into He family Taijiquan. Another disciple, Li Jingyan, created the Hulei style Taijiquan by combining his art with other martial arts popular in the local area where he lived. Chen Qingping is also credited as one of the teachers of Wu Yuxiang who later developed the Wu/Hao style taijiquan, sometimes referred to as the \\"Scholar-style of Taijiquan\\".

With a population of 55,304 recorded in the 2014 Moroccan census, Midelt serves as the commercial center of a large agricultural hinterland. It is also one of Morocco's principal cities for the mining of several minerals. Geography Midelt is situated on the main road between Fes and Meknes to the north and Errachidia to the south. Geographically, it is situated in the high plains surrounding the Moulouya River, between the Middle and High Atlas mountain ranges. The city's elevation is , making it one of the highest large towns in Morocco. Climate Midelt has a cold desert climate (Köppen: BWk). The elevation of Midelt and its relative proximity to the North Atlantic Ocean cools the daily temperatures to make Midelt one of the most temperate of the inland towns. However, many coastal towns have milder temperatures, warmer in winter and cooler in summer. Every winter, when a cold damp air coming from the north west influence Western Europe and Morocco, temperatures can fall dramatically well below -10 degrees Celsius in Midelt. However, these extreme conditions don't last for more than 5 continuous days. Temperature averages, from the years 1961 to 1990, yield daily maximum/minimum temperatures for January as 12.3 / 0.6 degrees Celsius and for July as 32.6 / 16.3 degrees Celsius. \\"Climatological Info. for Midelt, Morocco\\", Hong Kong Observatory, 2003, webpage: [http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/africa/mor_al/midelt_e.htm HKO- Midelt]. Snow is common in winter, and precipitation continues throughout the year at moderate levels. However, the principal water source of the region is a spring at the foot of Jbel Ayachi, south of Midelt. A dam moderating the flow from the spring was destroyed by a flood in early 2006 following heavy snows the previous winter, damaging the nearby village of Tattiwin. History The former French governor's residence, now cultural Centre Tarik Ibn Zyad Midelt grew in the first half of the 20th century around a French administrative post by the same name. Previously, villages and ksour had dotted the fertile surroundings. The French established their post to facilitate the mining of lead, gypsum, other minerals, and fossils in the nearby Ahouli and Mibladen mines and elsewhere. The development of these mines led to the construction of a railroad from Midelt to the Mediterranean coast and the electrification of Midelt in 1930. In Morocco, only Casablanca received electricity earlier. After Moroccan independence in 1956, control reverted to the Moroccan government. Midelt is currently the provincial capital of Midelt Province. People Midelt is a largely Berber city. Berber residents speak the Central Atlas Tamazight (Ait Ayache) language but most can also use the dialect of Darija. Educated residents also speak Standard Arabic as well as French, which are used throughout Morocco in mass media, education, and government. Because Midelt is a new city, almost all Mideltis can trace their roots either to one of the nearby villages or to elsewhere in Morocco. The city also lacks the sharply defined neighborhood divisions and traditional souqs of older Moroccan cities. Very few non-natives live in Midelt. Of these, the longest established are a community of Franciscan nuns and Cistercian monks (namely Trappists) living at the Priory of Our Lady of Atlas in a nearby village. The nuns work with local women and girls to develop handcrafts and teach hygiene, French language, and other skills. Economy Plums grow in the village of Berrem, south of Midelt Midelt functions as the market for an agricultural area extending from the Moulouya River to Jbel Ayachi, bounded on the east and west by dry plains. This region is best known for apples; other produce includes walnuts, apricots, plums, pomegranates, wheat, corn, and a wide variety of garden vegetables. Nomads and sedentary farmers from the surrounding area also raise sheep and goats for slaughter and for wool. Both of these are sold in Midelt, but largely for local consumption. Locally gathered evidence indicates that the local price of meat is inversely related to rainfall: in wet years, nomads can keep their herds alive through the summer and do not bring them to market; in dry years, animals are better sold than lost to draught. Midelt's industrial sector is largely related to the nearby mines, of which only Mibladen continues to operate at high capacity. Lead, gypsum, and a host of lesser-known minerals are extracted for sale to industry and for household decorations. Tourism continues to grow as an important source of revenue for Midelt. The climate attracts many visitors, mostly Moroccans from lower climes and émigrés to Europe. These support several small hotels as well as two larger establishments catering to Europeans. In addition to visitors, local handcrafts - especially carpets and blankets in the roughhewn nomadic style - are sold through cooperatives and merchants both locally and in Morocco's larger cities.

Test data generation Software testing is an important part of the Software Development Life Cycle today. It is a labor-intensive and also accounts for nearly half of the cost of the system development. Hence, it is desired that parts of testing should be automated.

The Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003 provides the legal framework for the scheme and for the allocation of tradable landfill allowances to each waste disposal authority in England. These allowances will convey the right for a waste disposal authority to landfill a certain amount of biodegradable municipal waste in a specified scheme year. Each waste disposal authority is able to determine how to use its allocation of allowances in the most effective way. It will be able to trade allowances with other authorities, save them for future years (bank) or use some of its future allowances in advance (borrow). This will allow individual waste disposal authorities to use their allowances in accordance with their investment strategy. Performance In its first year, 2005/6, the total tonnage of biodegradable waste that could be landfilled in England was 15,196,000. The calculated amount that was landfilled was 12,386,666 tonnes, 18.5% less BMW than they were allocated.Report on the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme 2006/2006 , www.environment-agency.gov.uk, Retrieved 29 November 2006 Although it was deemed \\"a major driver of rapid landfill diversion and recycling rates\\" by the European Union, after 2010 the landfill tax had a greater effect in waste disposal. Alt URL Ten LATS facts *The LATS was launched on 1 April 2004. Allowances were allocated to each waste disposal authority at a level that will enable England to meet its targets, as a contribution to the UK targets, under the Landfill Directive. *The flexibilities of trading, banking and borrowing will enable waste disposal authorities to meet their obligations under the scheme in the most cost-effective way. *Trading is not mandatory, but it is an opportunity. The advantage of trading for local authorities is that overcomes the fact that different waste disposal authorities will face different diversion costs depending on their particular circumstances. *Unlimited banking is allowed between target years but allowances cannot be banked out of a target year or the year preceding a target year. *Authorities are able to borrow up to 5% of the next year's allowance, although allowances cannot be borrowed into the target year or the year preceding a target year as this may cause England as a whole to breach its target. *Trading and Borrowing must be recorded on the web-based allowance Register that is being developed by Defra. *The Environment Agency, the monitoring authority for England, will use the mass balance process to monitor the amount of biodegradable waste sent to landfill in any year by each waste disposal authority (WDA). *WDAs will be required to provide quarterly returns to the Environment Agency within three months at the end of each quarter via WasteDataFlow. *A fixed penalty of £150/tonne will be incurred if a waste disposal authority breaches its landfill allowances target in the scheme year. *There is no reason why an authority should ever need to pay a penalty - the six-month reconciliation period at the end of each scheme year will give authorities the opportunity to trade or borrow allowances to ensure that they comply with their obligations. Definition Clarity London's Western Riverside Waste Authority has declared that LATS guidance is flawed. The initial definition of municipal waste counted it as any waste that originated from houses or households. The most recent LATS guidance indicates that municipal waste is any waste under the control of the waste disposal authority. The problem lies when the waste disposal authority collects a proportion of commercial and industrial waste, which in one piece of legislation is counted and in the other is exempt. This leads to the potential for fines for some authorities.WRWA to meet Defra over \\"serious flaws\\" in LATS guidance, www.letsrecycle.com, Retrieved 23 November 2006 See also *Biodegradability *Biodegradable waste *Landfill tax References Waste legislation in the United Kingdom ","title":"Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme"},{"id":"6476935","text":"Blackdown or Black Down may refer to:  Places  In Australia: * Blackdown, Queensland, a locality in the Central Highlands Region *Blackdown Tableland National Park in Queensland.

It is hosted by Mark Walker, son of Catchphrase presenter Roy Walker, with Stephen Rhodes as the voiceover. Contestants competed to win cash and prizes by uncovering symbols on a gameboard in a test of their recall abilities. Its mascot was Jools, a computer-animated, thieving orange cat in a red cap and a black-and-white striped sweater. Gameplay Two teams, each consisting of one man and one woman, competed through two rounds in the main game to win (\\"steal,\\" in the show's parlance) cash and prizes by uncovering them on a 4-by-4 grid of squares. Various symbols were in the squares: * Green cash square (6): Win between £0 and £25 by pressing the buzzer to stop a randomiser. * Swag bag (4): Win a prize, which may be valuable (e.g. a pocket translator) or worthless (e.g. a \\"12-piece tea set\\" that was actually a shattered teacup and saucer). * Burglar mask (1): Steal a prize from the opposing team. * Jools (3): Play an arcade-style computer game for additional cash. These games often involved Jools' cat sidekick Scruff and/or his arch- enemy, Boxer the guard dog. * Jail (2): Awarded nothing. Round 1 A toss- up question was asked, open to all contestants on the buzzer. A correct answer awarded initial control to that team, while a miss awarded it to the opponents. The board was displayed to the teams for 10 seconds, then covered up and rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The team in control was asked to find a particular symbol (cash, swag, or Jools). If they succeeded, they won whatever was associated with that square. If they found the wrong type or a jail square, they won nothing for that turn. Finding the burglar mask allowed a team to steal one prize from their opponents at any time until the end of the round. The teams alternated choosing squares, and the round ended when all the cash and swag had been uncovered. Round 2 Gameplay proceeded as in Round 1, with the following changes: * There was no initial toss-up question; the team that did not play last in Round 1 had initial control. * The board was displayed for only 5 seconds and then turned 180 degrees. * Green cash squares were now worth between £0 and £50. * Finding a jail square deducted £5 from a team's score. * Three of the six cash squares now displayed a red background instead of green. If a team found one of these, they had to press their buzzer to stop a randomiser between £0 and £50, and they lost that much cash to their opponents. When teams were asked to find cash on the board, they needed to uncover only the green squares. The team with the higher cash total at the end of this round won the game and advanced to the bonus round. Both teams kept whatever cash and prizes they had accumulated. Bonus round Only one member of the winning team played this round. Five special symbols were hidden on the board: a key, bank, alarm, vault, and safe. The contestant had 60 seconds and eight chances to find these symbols in any order. Also hidden on the board were six cash squares (two each of £5, £25, and £50), and five police helmets that each deducted 5 seconds from the clock if found. The board was shown for 5 seconds before being covered up; the innermost four squares then rotated 180 degrees counterclockwise, while the outer ring of squares rotated clockwise by the same amount. If all five symbols were found, the team won the jackpot, which started at £1,000 and increased by £500 for each game in which it went unclaimed. The jackpot maximum was £3,000 (£5,000 in Series 3).

The letterbox is clearly visible Cranmere Pool is a small depression within a peat bog in the northern half of Dartmoor, Devon, England, at . It lies above sea level on the western flank of Hangingstone Hill, close to the source of the West Okement River, about north west of the source of the East Dart River, and about the same distance west of the River Taw's source.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map OL28 Location and history The pool lies within the Okehampton Artillery Range, one of the Ministry of Defence ranges. A military access road which made it possible to drive to within of the pool was closed for civilian use in 2010. Walking distance from the closest civilian road access is now approximately , from the north, at , at a starting height of above sea level and using the existing military access road. Cranmere Pool was once a permanent pool of water, but William Crossing, writing early in the 20th century, stated that it had been over a hundred years since this had been the case. The only time there is standing water today is after heavy rainfall. Cranmere Pool is the location of the first letterbox. William Crossing relates in his Guide to Dartmoor that James Perrott, a well-known Dartmoor guide from Chagford, built a cairn in the pool and placed a bottle there for visitors' cards in 1854. Legends Cranmere Pool is at the heart of several Dartmoor legends, the most common of which involve the former mayor of Okehampton, Benjamin Gayer or Gear who was actually mayor of the town five times during the 17th century and has a memorial in Okehampton church vestry. In one version of the legend \\"Benjie Gear\\" was convicted of stealing sheep and as punishment was ordered to empty Cranmere Pool with a sieve. Being a resourceful person, he stole and killed another sheep and lined the sieve with its skin which allowed him to empty the pool so quickly that the town of Okehampton, in the valley below, was flooded. For this misdemeanour he was hanged on nearby Hangingstone Hill and his spirit was condemned to spin all the sand at the bottom of the now- empty pool into ropes. And since he has been unable to find any way of doing this, he is still there and can be heard on dark nights moaning and wailing about his never-ending task.Various versions of this legend exist. See for example: In popular culture In Ernest George Henham's 1906 novel A Pixy in Petticoats (London: Alston Rivers), Cranmere Pool and its famous letterbox play a vital part in the plot. It is a story of unrequited love between Beatrice Pentreath and John Burrough that occurs primarily in Dartmoor. In August 2015 the pool was featured in BBC television's Edwardian Farm.

Built in 1977 in the shape of an elongated hexagon, the theatre is operated by Reading Borough Council under the name \\"Reading Arts and Venues\\" along with South Street Arts Centre and Reading's concert hall.  Architecture  The theatre was built in 1977 by Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall (RMJM), who also built the adjacent Civic Centre. The original design featured a proscenium but no fly tower. Upon opening, the venue was comparable to Derby's Assembly Rooms—which also opened in 1977—but the Hexagon was described as architecturally and acoustically superior. As the building was designed to operate as a multi-use venue, the arena-style seating was used to avoid limited visibility. This proved useful for sports such as snooker or boxing, but rendered a number of seats unusable during performances that utilised the proscenium. A review of the Hexagon's architectural design in a 1979 edition of the Architects' Journal surmised that dramatic performances were seen as a low priority in the design—despite an estimated quarter of all events being of this type. The stalls, which use removable and retractable seats, have less headroom than the balcony above. This results in shallow overhangs. The theatre floor, which usually holds stall seating, is adjustable to allow a contiguous service with the stage, providing a surface. The balconies, which are separated by gaps around the auditorium, are similar to those at Christchurch Town Hall. Similarly, the inclined panels around the room—to introduce reflections—may have been inspired by that venue. The venue allows a number of different seating configurations, which affect the capacity. For performances with a proscenium arch, the capacity is 946. This increases to 1,200 for an all-seated concert and 1,686 for standing with balcony seating. The various seating arrangements affect the auditorium volume— and respectively for music and drama performances, as well as the reverberation times—1.1 seconds for concerts and 0.9 seconds for drama. The theatre's diameter is roughly .  Acoustics  Inside the theatre Originally, the Hexagon used an electronically assisted reverberation system; this has now been removed. In a review of the system, one author wrote that the system \\"seemed inaudible in the stalls but made a minor contribution in the balcony\\", concluding that it \\"still [left] an inadequate sense of reverberation.\\" Acoustic panelling is used throughout the auditorium. The ceiling features rotatable acoustic screens to provide reflections to the balcony seats. In acoustic tests performed by Sound Research Laboratories, the venue was found to have a short reverberation time—roughly one second in theatre configuration—which results in a high objective clarity. The assisted resonance system was found to increase this to 1.5 seconds at 200 Hz. The balcony seats have been described as having an inadequate level of early reflections and speech performance was judged to be poor. It has been concluded that rectifying the room's acoustics for the benefit of theatre and speech would be detrimental to other uses of the venue such as boxing. Events include classical music, comedy, dance, drama, pop and rock concerts. In past years the venue has also been used for snooker.

She was the younger sister of Kinga of Poland (Kunegunda) and Yolanda of Poland and, through her father, the niece of the famed Elizabeth of Hungary. Life Margaret was born in Klis Fortress in the Kingdom of Croatia, the eighth and last daughter (9th of 10 children) of the royal couple. They resided there during the Mongol invasion of Hungary (1241–42) as her father was also ruler of this land. Her parents vowed that if Hungary was liberated from the Mongols, they would dedicate the child to religion. The three-year-old Margaret was entrusted by her parents to the Dominican monastery at Veszprém in 1245. Six years later she was transferred to the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin founded by her parents on Nyulak Szigete (Rabbit Island) near Buda (today Margaret Island, named after her, and a part of Budapest; the ruins of the monastery can still be seen). She spent the rest of her life there, dedicating herself to religion and opposing all attempts of her father to arrange a political marriage for her with King Ottokar II of Bohemia.Aldásy, Antal. \\"Bl. Margaret of Hungary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 26 July 2019{{PD-notice} She appears to have taken solemn vows when she was eighteen years old. In marked contrast to the customs of her Order, she received the Consecration of Virgins along with some other royals to prevent further attempts on the part of her father to have her vows dispensed by the pope for marriage. Many of the details of her life are known from the Legend of Saint Margaret, written probably in the 14th century and translated from Latin to Hungarian in the 15th. The only remaining copy of the legend is in the Margaret Codex copied by the Dominican nun Lea Ráskay around 1510. According to the legend, Margaret chastised herself from early childhood, wore an iron girdle, hairshirts and shoes spiked with nails performed the most menial work in the convent. The extravagance of the penances she undertook may have shortened her life.Duffy, Patrick. \\"Jan 18 – St Margaret of Hungary (1242-70)\\", Catholic Ireland, January 18, 2012 She died on 18 January 1270. Veneration She was venerated as a saint soon after her death, e.g., a church dedicated to her in Bocfolde, Zala County, appears in documents dated 1426. Steps were taken to procure her canonization shortly after her death, at the request of her brother King Stephen V. The necessary investigations were taken up between 1270 and 1276, but the canonization process was not successful, even though 74 miracles were ascribed to her intercession, most of them referring to curing illnesses, even someone coming back from the dead. Among those giving testimony were 27 people for whom miracles had been wrought. Unsuccessful attempts to canonize her were also made in 1640 and 1770. She was finally canonized by Pope Pius XII on November 19, 1943, at that time the feast day of her aunt, Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. Her feast day is celebrated by the Dominican Order. Raised by Pope Pius VII to a festum duplex, it is the day of her death, January 18. Her monastery was among those suppressed in 1782, part of the suppression of all monastic orders by the Emperor Joseph II. At that time, her remains were given to the Poor Clares. They were kept in Pozsony (today Bratislava) and Buda. The relics were partly destroyed in 1789 but some portions were preserved and are now kept in Esztergom, Győr, and Pannonhalma.

He was a brother of Pius, Bishop of Rome about the middle of the 2nd century. Some later writers confuse him with Hermas of Dalmatia, mentioned in . Hermas the freedman was the character and, by some estimations, the author of the work titled The Shepherd of Hermas, which, in the early Church, was sometimes classed among the canonical \\"Scriptures\\". There are three sources indicating Hermas was the brother of Pius I: * (a) the Muratorian fragment,: \\"Pastorem vero nuperrime temporibus nostris in urbe Roma Herma conscripsit, sedente cathedra urbis Romae ecclesiae Pio episcopo fratre ejus. Et ideo legi eum quidem oportet, se publicare vero in ecclesia populo neque inter prophetas completos numero, neque inter apostolos in fine temporum, potest\\" - \\"And very recently, in our own times, in the city of Rome, Herma wrote the Pastor, when his brother Pius, the bishop, sat upon the chair of the Church of the city of Rome. And therefore that (book) ought to be perused, but it cannot be publicly read to the people assembled in church, neither among the Prophets, whose number is complete, nor among the Apostles (who came) in the end of times.\\" * (b) the Liberian catalogue of popes, in a portion which dates from 235 (Hippolytus?): \\"Sub hujus (Pii) episcopatu frater ejus Ermes librum scripsit, in quo mandatum continetur quae (quod) praecepit ei angelus, cum venit ad illum in habitu Pastoris\\" - \\"Under his (Pius') episcopate, his brother Ermes wrote a book in which are contained the precepts which the angel delivered to him, coming to him in the guise of a Shepherd.\\" * (c) the poem of Pseudo- Tertullian against Marcion, of the 3rd or 4th century: \\"Post hunc deinde Pius, Hermas cui germine frater angelicus Pastor, quia tradita verba locutus.\\" - \\"Then, after him, Pius, whose brother according to the flesh was Hermas, the angelic shepherd, because he spoke the words given to him.\\" The statement that Hermas wrote during his brother's Pius pontificate may similarly be an inference from the fact that it was in a list of popes, against the name of Pius, that the writer found the information that Hermas was that pope's brother. He may have been an elder brother of the pope. The Shepherd has been viewed as an allegory, similar to Pilgrim's Progress.

He was a five-time champion of Kiev, and trained the world title challenger David Bronstein from a young age. He was awarded the title of International Master (IM) by FIDE in 1950, won the first Soviet Correspondence Chess Championship in 1951, earned the IM title at correspondence in 1966, and earned the title of Honorary Grandmaster in 1983.  Ukrainian master  Born in Zhytomir, Ukraine (then Russian Empire), Konstantinopolsky was nearly 20 when he learned the game. This makes him one of the oldest top players in terms of learning the moves of the game. At the beginning of his career, Konstantinopolsky won the Kiev championships five consecutive times from 1932 to 1936. He played in seven Ukrainian SSR championships. In 1931, he tied for 3rd-5th in Kharkov (6th UKR-ch). In 1933, he took 3rd in Kharkov (7th UKR-ch). In 1936, he took 4th in Kiev (8th UKR-ch). In 1937, he tied for 3rd-4th in Kiev (9th UKR-ch), which was won by Fedor Bohatirchuk. In 1938, he took 3rd in Kiev (10th UKR-ch), which was won by Isaac Boleslavsky. In 1939, he took 3rd in Dnepropetrovsk (11th UKR-ch). In 1940, he tied for 8th-9th in Kiev (12th UKR-ch). Boleslavsky also won in both 1939 and 1940. Konstantinopolsky's early games from this period are largely missing from games databases. (portrait photo from his later years at bidmonta.com under Konstantinopolsky heading) In 1936, Konstantinopolsky played in a Leningrad Young Masters' tournament, scoring 7½/14 in a strong field which played a double round robin format. Konstantinopolsky played several times in Soviet Chess Championships. In 1931, he tied for 3rd-5th (7th URS-ch semifinal), in Moscow. In 1934, he tied for 11th-13th in Tbilisi (9th URS-ch sf). In April/May 1937, he tied for 2nd-3rd with Viacheslav Ragozin, behind Grigory Levenfish, in Tbilisi (10th URS-ch), with a score of 12/19. In 1938, he tied for 11th-12th in Kiev (URS-ch sf). In 1940, he tied for 4th-7th in Kiev (URS-ch sf), with a score of 9½/16. In September/October 1940, he tied for 13th-16th in Moscow (12th URS-ch), with a score of 8/19.  Theorist and trainer  During the late 1930s, Konstantinopolsky trained young players and amateurs in Kiev, at the Palace of Young Pioneers. He was widely regarded as a friendly and kindly man. His prize pupil was the young David Bronstein, who eventually challenged for the World Championship title in 1951, drawing the match against Mikhail Botvinnik. Konstantinopolsky and Bronstein were close friends, and Konstantinopolsky served as Bronstein's second for the 1950 Candidates' playoff match in Moscow, against Isaac Boleslavsky, which Bronstein won by 7½-6½. He was one of the Ukrainian pioneers who developed the King's Indian Defence into prominence, along with Boleslavsky and Bronstein. The variation had been considered suspect until the mid-1930s. During this time, he played one of the earliest games in the Yugoslav Attack against the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence, a line which would become very popular about 20 years later. He also defended the Dutch Defence with success at a time when it was rarely played by top players. Konstantinopolsky had a very wide opening repertoire with both colours, a very valuable attribute which he passed on to his prize pupil Bronstein. He was also a formidable strategist and tactician, as the games selection shows.  Grandmastership denied  He played in the tournament Leningrad / Moscow 1939, scoring an excellent 8½/17 against an exceptionally strong field. During World War II, he played in national tournaments. In 1940, he took 3rd in Lvov (Lviv, Lwów, Lemberg), which was won by Abram Khavin. The war then seems to have stopped his chess activity for about three years. In February 1943, he won in Kuibyshev. In April/May 1943, he took 6th in Sverdlovsk, a very strong tournament, with 6½/14; the event was won by Botvinnik. In August/September 1943, he took 2nd, behind Boleslavsky, in Kuibyshev. In 1943, he won a match against Yakov Rokhlin (+7 –0 =1). In 1944, he won a match against Lev Aronin (+6 –1 =5). In 1944, he moved to stay in Moscow. He played in the 1945 Moscow City Championship, probably on average the strongest such event in the world, scoring 9/16. After the war, he played in several more Soviet championships. In 1945, he tied for 1st-3rd in Baku (URS-ch sf), with Alexander Kotov and Iosif Rudakovsky, each scoring 10½/15. In June 1945, he tied for 4th-6th in Moscow (14th URS-ch), with 10½/18; the tournament was won by Botvinnik. In 1947, he tied for 3rd-4th in Moscow (URS- ch sf). In 1948, he tied for 6th-9th in Moscow (16th URS-ch), with 9½/17; the tournament was won jointly by Bronstein and Alexander Kotov. In 1950, he tied for 2nd-4th in Tartu (URS-ch sf), with a score of 10/15. In 1950, he tied for 5th-6th in Moscow (18th URS-ch), with 7½/14; the tournament was won by Paul Keres. In 1952, he took 16th in Moscow (20th URS-ch), with 7/19; the tournament was won jointly by Botvinnik and Mark Taimanov. He played in the Soviet Team Championship, Riga 1954, scoring 5½/10; this was his last really strong performance. His over-the-board play seems to have largely stopped about 1955, as he concentrated more on correspondence chess and on his job as a trainer and coach. He did play occasionally over-the-board in later years. The website Chessmetrics.com, which provides retroactive ratings for older players, ranks him as 11th in the world in 1945. So, his best results in the Soviet national championships, which during that period were the strongest tournaments in the world, were four times in the top six (1937, 1945, 1948, 1950). In any virtually other nation in the world during that period, he would have been its national champion, and an almost certain Grandmaster. Because the Soviet chess talent was so deep, he never earned the highest chess title. His best games show he could hold his own with anyone in the USSR, with victories over Botvinnik, Keres, Kotov, Boleslavsky, Grigory Levenfish, Vasily Smyslov, Salo Flohr, Alexander Tolush, Viacheslav Ragozin, Andor Lilienthal, Viktor Korchnoi, Yuri Averbakh, Ratmir Kholmov, Boris Verlinsky, and others.  Later years  In 1948–1951, Konstantinopolsky won the 1st Soviet Correspondence Chess Championship. He was awarded the title of International Master (IM) in 1950, that of International Master of correspondence chess (IMC) in 1966, and that of Honorary Grandmaster (HGM) in 1983. According to his game files, he only had one chance to play over-the-board in an international tournament outside the Soviet Union, the 'B' section of Amsterdam 1966, when he was well past his prime at age 56. Even so, he scored a creditable 5/9. He continued to work as one of the Soviet Union's most respected trainers well into his 70s.

Rugby union career Mossop played rugby union for the Manly club and played eight tests for the Wallabies from 1948 to 1951. His international rugby union career was played at lock. In 1950 he was chosen in the All-Australian team for that season selected by the magazine Sporting Life. Rugby league career Switching to rugby league in England in 1951, he played with Championship side Leigh. He returned to Australia and Sydney's Northern Beaches in 1956, joining the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles who played in the New South Wales Rugby League Premiership and became the cornerstone of their forward pack in the late 1950s. Ever an aggressive front-row forward, Mossop played in the Manly sides that lost to the St George Dragons in grand finals in 1957 and 1959. In the lead up to the 1959 Grand Final, rumours were circulating that Mossop was carrying a broken cheekbone. From the kick off, Saints' forwards took turns at testing Mossop's injury with opposing prop Harry Bath giving him particular attention. For most of the match the Manly forward copped a hammering until in frustration, Mossop retaliated by standing on Bath's head. A brawl broke out between the two and the referee Darcy Lawler sent both off. Mossop later recalled how after both he and Bath had left the league judiciary the following week, that they got talking and both got a laugh about being told off like naughty school boys. A mutual respect for each other had developed into what would be a lifelong friendship between the pair. Notwithstanding his uncompromising playing style, Mossop won a newspaper's \\"best and fairest\\" award for the 1958 season. He first represented Australia in rugby league at age 30 in 1958 in the first Test against the touring Great Britain side at the Sydney Cricket Ground, an appearance in which he became Australia's 25th dual code rugby international, following Ken Kearney (a teammate that day playing hooker) and preceding Arthur Summons. He scored a try on début as the Australian's defeated the tourists 25–8. Mossop then played in the remaining Ashes Tests though the Lions would go on to win the remaining games and the series 2–1. He then toured with the Kangaroos to Great Britain in 1959-60 as vice-captain. Mossop played a total of nine Tests for Australia. In 1959 Mossop played in the New South Wales loss to Queensland that attracted 35,261 spectators to the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, smashing Brisbane's previous record for an interstate match of 22,817. Queensland won the game 17–15. He played 136 games for Manly, retiring in 1963 at age 35. Rex Mossop is listed on the Australian Rugby League Players Register as Kangaroo No. 336.ARL Annual report 2005, page 54 Commentator As was normal for professional rugby league players of the time, Mossop had a full-time job: as a car salesman for one of Sydney's largest car dealers, Stacks Holden. In 1963 he heard that Channel 7 were advertising for a Sports Director. Despite not having any television or broadcasting experience, Mossop won the position over sixty applicants for the job, many of whom possessed better television credentials than he did. Mossop first appeared on air in 1964 and called his first game in 1965, only four years after former player Ray Stehr had carried out the first ever commercial telecast on Channel 9 in 1961. He spent 20 years as host of a rugby league preview show including the Controversy Corner discussion segment. From the early 1970s till 1990 on Sydney channels Seven and then Ten he was the voice of rugby league and the pre-eminent TV match broadcast caller. His criticism of players and referees was blunt and uncompromising and his calling style was seen by opposing fans as parochially favouring Manly. His match commentaries and indeed his other forays into the public domain were often filled with tautological descriptors that in eastern state Australian vernacular became known as \\"Mossopisms\\": These mistakes also led to his nickname, \\"Rox Messup\\".A sad day for Rugby League - Rex Mossop passed away... , sportal.com.au, Tim Mander (7 April 2008), accessed 22 June 2011 * \\"if I keep getting Boyd and O'Grady mixed up, it's because they look alike, especially around the head\\" * \\"tiny, diminutive, little Mark Shulman\\" * \\"he seems to be favouring a groin injury at the top of his leg\\" * \\"now the referee's giving him a verbal tongue lashing\\" * \\"I don't think the male genitals or the female genitals should be rammed down people's throats … to use a colloquialism.\\" * \\"He's made a great yardage of 25 metres.\\" * \\"There's too many backs in the three quarter line\\". * \\"He's making good forward progress\\". He also recorded such classics as: * \\"Son of a very famous father\\" * \\"A little bit marginal\\" * \\"Very mobile running\\" The perceived parochialism towards Manly - and a gruff style that bordered on arrogance - often alienated him with league supporters, so much so that he was once famously hit in the side of the head with a piece of fruit thrown at him while giving a live post- match summary. With his long association with Channel 7 many celebrities and media still refer to ATN Channel 7 as Channel REX. As a commentator, Mossop also covered the 1978, 1982 and 1986 Kangaroo Tours for Australian television. Never one to hold back his comments, when describing the Australians 34-4 demolition of Great Britain in the second test at Elland Road in Leeds during the undefeated 1986 tour, Mossop said as Brett Kenny crossed for the Kangaroos 6th try (pushing the score at that stage to 32-0) \\"Australia carved them up. They've decimated, dissected and absolutely diabolically destroyed this Great Britain side today\\"'. Through his work with Channel 7 during the 1960s, Mossop also became a commentator at the Sydney Showground Speedway during the summer months.Sydney Showground Speedway He would also commentate on other speedway events during his career including working with ATN's motorsports director and Liverpool City Raceway promoter Mike Raymond on televised events from Liverpool such as the 1982 Speedway World Pairs Championship Final.1982 Speedway World Pairs Final - Heat 1 Other television work From 1970 to 1971, Mossop was the \\"Beast\\" on the television talk show Beauty and the Beast. From 1991 to 1995, he was a regular panel member on Andrew Denton's sport- themed comedy talk show, Live and Sweaty, on the ABC alongside others including actor Lex \\"The Swine\\" Marinos, former Australian rules footballer Peter \\"Crackers\\" Keenan, Karen Tighe, Debbie \\"Skull of Rust\\" Spillane and Elle McFeast (Libbi Gorr). Honours Mossop became a life member of the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) in 1999 in recognition of services to the game. In 2006, Mossop was named in both the Manly Rugby League and Manly Rugby Union \\"best ever\\" sides, highlighting his enormous contribution to both codes. Rex Mossop was awarded the Australian Sports Medal on 24 October 2000 for services to Rugby League. Personal Mossop was the younger son of Norman, a World War I veteran who had been wounded in battle at Passchendale, and Nellie Mossop (née Kirkpatrick). Born in Five Dock, New South Wales, he had an elder brother, Kirk, who later became a noted artist. The family lived in Five Dock but moved to Balgowlah by the time he was five. He attended Manly Boys High School, leaving in 1943 to become initially an apprentice fitter and turner, and later a sales representative for a variety of businesses prior to his career in television. Mossop married Joan Mildred Bell on 26 October 1951 at St Matthew's Church, Manly.NSW Registry Birth Death & Marriages ; Marriage Reference No. 24183/1951. District of Manly. The couple had two sons, Kirk (1952) and Gregory (1956). In 1976, Mossop made a citizen's arrest of a nudist at Balgowlah Beach later stating \\"I don't need the male genitalia rammed down my throat\\".Rex Mossop: Rugby league player who became a-love-him-or-loathe-him commentator The Independent 16 July 2011 In his final years, Mossop suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He died aged 83 on 17 June 2011 at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney surrounded by family and friends. His funeral was held on 24 June 2011 at St Matthews Church, Manly. As a mark of respect for Mossop, the Manly Sea Eagles players wore black armbands for their Round 15 clash with traditional rivals Parramatta on 20 June 2011 at Manly's home ground, Brookvale Oval, and a minute's silence was observed before kick off.\\"Vale Rex Mossop\\" References Further reading *Rex Mossop & Larry Writer: The Moose That Roared.

Sounds vibrate the membrane, and the vibrations are sensed by a chordotonal organ. Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants, etc.) do not have a tympanal organ, but they do have a Johnston's organ. Tympanal organs occur in just about any part of the insect: the thorax, the base of the wing, the abdomen, the legs, etc., depending on the group of insects. The structures are thought to have evolved independently many times. As a result, their position and structures are often used to help determine the taxonomy of the species. For example, all members of the Geometridae share distinctive paired abdominal tympanal organs that open towards the front side of the first abdominal segment. Within the organ, particular structures vary in shape and are used to indicate shared ancestry of subfamilies. In other families of Lepidoptera having abdominal tympanal organs, the opening may be in a different orientation and the structures differ in shape. Tympanal organs have evolved in Lepidoptera to allow them to detect the echolocation calls of predatory bats. The range of frequencies that the moth is most sensitive to is usually associated with the frequencies used in echolocation by the sympatric bat community. In the presence of predatory bats, it has been shown that the Lepidoptera species Mythimna unipuncta (true armyworm) stops mating behaviors, such as female calling and male wing flapping.Acharya, L. “Predation Risk and Mating Behavior: the Responses of Moths to Bat-like Ultrasound.” Behavioral Ecology, vol. 9, no. 6, 1 Jan. 1998, pp. 552–558., doi:10.1093/beheco/9.6.552. As well, hearing is important for mating behaviors in this species because females increase their flapping frequency around males and males produce a trembling noise in response.Fitzpatrick, Sheila M., and Jeremy N. Mcneil. “Male Scent In Lepidopteran Communication: The Role Of Male Pheromone In Mating Behaviour Of Pseudaletia Unipuncta (Haw.)

Biography Canisius was a half-brother of St. Peter Canisius. After winning, at the age of twenty-two, the highest academic distinction at Louvain, he decided to follow his stepbrother and enter the Society of Jesus, and was sent to St. Ignatius of Loyola in Rome, who received him into the Society. On the completion of his novitiate, Theodorich was appointed professor of theology in Vienna, but was soon after appointed rector of the Jesuit College at Munich. Here, in 1562, one of the first productions in Germany of the morality play Homulus (corresponding to the English Everyman or the Dutch Elckerlijc) was given in Latin by the students under his direction. From Munich, where he was succeeded in 1565 by the celebrated Paul Hoffaeus, he was transferred to Dillingen, where for twenty years he presided over the college and the academy and laboured with zeal and success for the improvement of studies and for the religious training of the students. From 1565 to 1582 he held the office of chancellor of the university. In company with his distinguished brother, he attended the first provincial congregation of the Society of Jesus in Upper Germany, and furthered important reforms in the teaching of philosophy. In 1585 he was made rector of the Jesuit College of Ingolstadt, and in this capacity became a member of the German commission which tested in practice the first draft of the Ratio Studiorum. At length, having spent thirty years at the head of three of the foremost colleges of Germany, he was sent to Lucerne in Switzerland to enjoy a period of rest; but soon again, at the age of sixty-three, he had to undertake the government of the college of Ingolstadt. Two years later, on the advice of his physician, he was relieved of the burden and allowed to return to Lucerne. A fortnight after his arrival the death of St. Peter Canisius was announced; the shock deprived Theodorich of memory and speech, an affliction which he bore with exemplary patience for seven years. For his amiable disposition and spotless purity of life he deservedly received the surname of Angelus 'angel'. In 1604, he was transferred again to Ingolstadt, where he died, and was interred in the church of the Holy Cross.

It is under the jurisdiction of the Toronto District School Board. From its founding until 1998, it was part of the Scarborough Board of Education. The school was opened in 1955 and named after the community of West Hill, Toronto in which the school is located, and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2005. It is a non-semestered composite high school and home of the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Centre of Innovation program. West Hill has a proud tradition of excellence in academic, artistic, and athletic endeavours, with numerous awards, citations and championships garnered. West Hill C.I.'s motto is Surgo in Lucem which translates as I rise into the light. History With population growth increasing, the newly-formed Scarborough Board of Education (a board forerunner to the TDSB) opened several new schools beginning in the mid-late 1950s. Before the construction of the new local high school, students lived in the West Hill area attended Scarborough Collegiate Institute (renamed to R.H. King in 1954). The school, now known as West Hill Collegiate Institute began its construction 1954 and the staff was in place in May 1954. On May 31, 1954, SBE acquired additional seven acres for the new school. As its fourth high school in the borough, West Hill Collegiate Institute opened its doors on September 6. 1955, with 25 staff and 376 students along with its first principal, Harvey A.C. Farrow and vice-principal Francis S. Jennings. The original building was designed by the Toronto-based architectural firm Carter, Coleman and Rankin Associates.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/892 West Hill was officially opened on December 14, 1955. From the beginning, the original building consisted of 27 classrooms, a library, main office, gymnatorium, and cafeteria. Expansion of the school had resulted additional construction of 12 classrooms in 1959, followed by the auditorium in 1963, and the second gymnasium and swimming pool in 1971. By 1977, West Hill held with 2131 students with 100 teachers. Today, West Hill capacity can be up to 1407 students. In 2002, West Hill was noted for beating rival R. H. King Academy 150 to 58 in a basketball game in which West Hill star Denham Brown scored 13 three pointers. From the 2009-10 school year, West Hill kept the Warriors moniker, but the Native American head, which was used since its inception, was replaced with a stylized Trojan mascot in 2010. West Hill Collegiate Institute was one of several Toronto high schools with low enrolment rates that were placed under Pupil Accommodation Review in 2015 by the Toronto school board. Crest The crest for West Hill consists of a red shield with a white shield bordered in black and silver containing a red sun on the top, between a magic lantern (commonly found on most school logos in the TDSB) and a sheaf is the school motto, \\"Surgo in Lucem\\" (I rise into the light) in a black banner. On the bottom of the crest, there is the white banner inscription that reads \\"West Hill Collegiate Institute\\". Campus West Hill is located near the intersection of Kingston Rd and Morningside Avenue. Houses are to the west and Highland Creek to the north and east. It is next to Morningside Park, and close to the University of Toronto Scarborough and Centennial College as well as nearby separate school, St. John Paul II Catholic Secondary School. West Hill shares the same design as Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute and has since altered overtime. It began with 27 rooms but the school underwent a renovation during the 1970s to create an additional 50 classrooms, four gymnasiums, a library (named after West Hill's first principal, H.A.C. Farrow), two studios for the Drama Department, workshop rooms, and a quad to enable creative learning opportunities for studies in science. The area's revival took over a decade, and won several environmental awards. In addition, it serves as working grounds for visual arts students. The school holds a swimming pool in its southwest wing, which is open to staff, students, and the community. Programs The 598-seated Francis S. Jennings Auditorium. Athletics West Hill Collegiate Institute's physical education department has a student-run council (West Hill Athletic Council or WHAC), which organizes school spirit assemblies, the Athletic Banquet, and intramural sports. Arts The Drama Department participates in the Ontario Sears Drama Festival, and every winter, they perform a play. West Hill has a concert band which has competed in music competitions since the 1980s and have ranked first several times. The Music Department features two annual concerts: one in winter for the holidays and one in the spring called, \\"Music in May\\". Leadership The Student Activity Council (SAC) plans and executes events and activities for the student body such as Grade 9 Orientation Day, Welcome Back Carnival, Holiday Concert, Semi-Formal and Prom. Students are elected for SAC positions every June and decisions are made by the student body. The Prefects consists of students in grade 10 to 12 who are selected by teachers at the end of every school year. Prefects volunteer at events during the school year and occasionally organize their own events. Student philanthropists participate in an organization called Me to We which aims to make positive differences for society on a local and global level through events throughout the school year. Culture As a multicultural school, West Hill has clubs to reflect the culture and ethnic minorities present in the school. Some of the cultural clubs at WHCI include the Desi Club, Afro- Canadian Association, Muslim Student Association, Bengali Student Association, and West Indian Club, all of which perform in the school's multicultural assemblies. WHCI's Multicultural Committee plans and executes Food Fiestas and an annual Multicultural Night. Academics West Hill offers Advanced Placement opportunities in Mathematics, English, Chemistry, Biology and Physics which prepare students for studies at university. The West Hill Physics Club goes to McMaster University's Science Olympics every year. They have won the Paper Triathlon and placed third in Twist and Turn, a protein building exercise. The Robotics Club, SWATT (Scarborough Warriors at the Top) Team #1088, competed in the 2003 FIRST Robotics Competitions. As rookies, they won three awards: first place in the Canadian Regional Championships, Engineering Design and the Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers Entrepreneurship Awards. The team travelled to Houston, Texas that year to compete internationally; the following year, they went to Atlanta, Georgia. This club is inactive. Ranking The Fraser Institute gave West Hill C.I. an overall rating of 4.1/10 for the 2016–2017 school year, when the school was ranked 663 out of 747 Ontario high schools.

Such a language is used to create knowledge based systems or expert systems which can deduce answers to problem sets by applying the rules to the facts they have been given. An example of a deductive language is Prolog, or its database- query cousin, Datalog. History As the name implies, deductive languages are rooted in the principles of deductive reasoning; making inferences based upon current knowledge. The first recommendation to use a clausal form of logic for representing computer programs was made by Cordell Green (1969) at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). This idea can also be linked back to the battle between procedural and declarative information representation in early artificial intelligence systems. Deductive languages and their use in logic programming can also be dated to the same year when Foster and Elcock introduced Absys, the first deductive/logical programming language. Shortly after, the first Prolog system was introduced in 1972 by Colmerauer through collaboration with Robert Kowalski. Components The components of a deductive language are a system of formal logic and a knowledge base upon which the logic is applied. Formal Logic Formal logic is the study of inference in regards to formal content. The distinguishing feature between formal and informal logic is that in the former case, the logical rule applied to the content is not specific to a situation. The laws hold regardless of a change in context. Although first-order logic is described in the example below to demonstrate the uses of a deductive language, no formal system is mandated and the use of a specific system is defined within the language rules or grammar. As input, a predicate takes any object(s) in the domain of interest and outputs either one of two Boolean values: true or false. For example, consider the sentences \\"Barack Obama is the 44th president\\" and \\"If it rains today, I will bring an umbrella\\". The first is a statement with an associated truth value. The second is a conditional statement relying on the value of some other statement. Either of these sentences can be broken down into predicates which can be compared and form the knowledge base of a deductive language. Moreover, variables such as 'Barack Obama' or 'president' can be quantified over. For example, take 'Barack Obama' as variable 'x'. In the sentence \\"There exists an 'x' such that if 'x' is the president, then 'x' is the commander in chief.\\" This is an example of the existential quantifier in first order logic. Take 'president' to be the variable 'y'. In the sentence \\"For every 'y', 'y' is the leader of their nation.\\" This is an example of the universal quantifier. Knowledge Base A collection of 'facts' or predicates and variables form the knowledge base of a deductive language. Depending on the language, the order of declaration of these predicates within the knowledge base may or may not influence the result of applying logical rules. Upon application of certain 'rules' or inferences, new predicates may be added to a knowledge base. As new facts are established or added, they form the basis for new inferences. As the core of early expert systems, artificial intelligence systems which can make decisions like an expert human, knowledge bases provided more information than databases. They contained structured data, with classes, subclasses, and instances. Prolog Prolog is an example of a deductive, declarative language that applies first- order logic to a knowledge base. To run a program in Prolog, a query is posed and based upon the inference engine and the specific facts in the knowledge base, a result is returned. The result can be anything appropriate from a new relation or predicate, to a literal such as a Boolean (true/false), depending on the engine and type system. References * J.M. Foster and E.W.

Early life and career Born in London, England, in 1932, Ayers developed an interest during the Blitz. Ayers obtained a BSc in aeronautical engineering from the University of London and an MSc in aerodynamics from Cranfield University before starting his working career as an apprentice at Handley Page Ltd, eventually working his way up to helping design prototypes of the Handley Page Victor bomber aircraft. After that he was employed by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in their Guided Weapons Division, initially as Chief Aerodynamicist and then later Head of Operational Research and Deputy Head of Management Services. Much of his time at BAC was devoted to the development of the Bloodhound surface-to-air missile. Ayers is a Chartered Engineer and a member of the Royal Aeronautical Society. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to engineering. Land speed records In retirement, while working as a volunteer at Brooklands Museum, Ayers found research papers from pre-World War II record-breaking attempts, and it sparked his interest in record-breaking. His involvement in the land speed record-breaking attempt came about through a chance meeting with Richard Noble in the offices of Ken Norris, the designer behind Donald Campbell's record-breaking Bluebird CN7. Through a combination of rocket sled testing at Pendine Sands and extensive computational fluid dynamics testing, Ayers was able to develop and refine a shape which would eventually go on to break the sound barrier. Ayers was responsible for the design of the JCB Dieselmax which smashed the World Speed Record for diesel cars on 23 August 2006, clocking 350 mph. He is heavily involved in the design of the current land speed record attempt vehicle, the Bloodhound SSC. Personal life Ayers has one adult son.

It is one of the six traditional neighborhoods of Póvoa de Varzim and one of the eleven parts in which the city is subdivided. The quarter is situated south of Póvoa de Varzim City Center. It has green and white as neighborhood colors and Lancha Poveira as symbol, also the icon of the city. History View of the neighborhood from the sheltered bay in 1868. The Nossa Senhora da Lapa Brotherhood, founded in 1761, asked in 1767 for rights and privileges in \\"Chãos de Areia\\" (Sand ground) to establish their homes in there. these fisherman originally lived in downtown. The structure of parallel streets to the seaport of Póvoa de Varzim was already reasonably developed in this century. Raul Brandão describes the quarter as \\"two side streets on the sand, Eskimos burrow, dark, smoky, fish reeking, with branches stacked in the sand, and rays drying to the sun for Winter consumption.\\" When the fishermen community became prosperous, still in the 18th century, the quarter grew to the area of Poça da Barca, still around Póvoa bay, that certain historical documents placed in the territory of the town of Vila do Conde. Póvoa de Varzim's seaport was built on the sheltered bay in the 1930s. In 1853, due to the size of Póvoa de Varzim, larger than some cities, the Town Hall considers the creation of the parish of Lapa, given that the Póvoa was, then, divided into four districts. In 1858 it suggested the creation of the new civil parish which would include this neighborhood and the places of Poça da Barca, Regufe and Gandarinha to the Areia calvary in the limit of Poça da Barca and Caxinas, locations in the territory of Vila do Conde. A commission was nominated, with another one from Vila do Conde, who would present the project. On March 15, 1858, the Civil Government stated that the Póvoa should trade the locations of Cerca and Quintela of Argivai (because those are contiguous with Vila do Conde), for the one of Porça da Barca and Regufe, as it requested. However, on the following day, a new statement declared harmful to Vila do Conde such annexation, although the population of Poça da Barca also requested the annexation. At the end of the 19th century, the over-fishing by steamships authorized by the national government, namely with small mesh net that caught even the youngest fish, making the once abundant fish, that led to the prosperity of the community, starting to vanish significantly, creating severe social problems and emigration. But, in this century, the community had already enlarged even further to Vila do Conde territory. The religious parishes of Lapa, without the civil form, appeared in 1935 and in Vila do Conde the Parish of Caxinas and Poça da Barca appeared in 1944. Geography Bairro Sul highlighted in the urban area of Póvoa de Varzim Elísio da Nova Square. The district borders Póvoa de Varzim City Center to the north, to the East Matriz/Mariadeira, and to the South, the city of Vila do Conde. Festivals The main district festivals are the Feast of the Assumption, one of the largest of this kind in Portugal, the pinnacle of the procession occurs in front of Póvoa's seaport, where fireworks are launched from carefully arranged boats and Bairro Sul's Saint Peter festival.

Biography  Canisius was born Hendrik de Hondt (\\"The Dog\\", Latinized to Canisius) and belonged to the same distinguished family as Saint Peter Canisius, who was his uncle. He studied at the University of Leuven, and in 1590 was appointed professor of canon law at Ingolstadt.  Works  He was the author of \\"Summa Juris Canonici\\" (Ingolstadt, 1594); \\"Praelectiones Academicae\\" (ib., 1609); \\"Comment. in lib. III decretalium\\" (ib., 1629); \\"De Sponsalibus et Matrimonio\\" (ib., 1613). A complete edition of his canonical writings appeared in Leuven in 1649 and in Cologne in 1662. The fruits of his labours in the historical field appeared in a work entitled, \\"Antiquae Lectiones, seu antiqua monumenta ad historiam mediae aetatis illustrandam\\" (6 volumes, Ingolstadt, 1601–1604). In 1608 a seventh volume, a \\"Promptuarium Ecclesiasticum\\" was added by way of supplement. The work lacked systematic arrangement, and included much matter of minor value.

The opening credits featured Jane Pauley on-location at Lawrence Hall of Science, then Boeddeker Park. Real Life focused on positive, human interest-type stories and occasional celebrity profiles. Jane Pauley also presented less uplifting but still-lightweight features as well, such as a feature focusing on how less than 20% of the people who owned VCRs at the time actually knew how to program them. Boyd Matson was also featured as a correspondent; his reports featured stories on out of the way places. Real Life with Jane Pauley began as an hour-long program aired on Tuesday nights in the summer of 1990. It was put on hiatus in September of that year, returning in January 1991 as a mid-season replacement. At this time it was reduced to a half hour, the length it was to remain throughout the balance of its run. The last broadcast was on November 1, 1991.

Controlled by division artillery and not the aviation group, the 2nd Battalion, 20th Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division and the 4th Battalion, 77th Artillery, 101st Airborne Division, along with Battery F, 79th Artillery, 1st Cavalry Division, were the only ARA units fielded during that conflict. The ARA concept disappeared from Army aviation by the mid-1970s, replaced by more generic attack aviation units. History After the helicopter demonstrated its early battlefield capabilities in the Korean War, the United States Army began experimenting with expanded roles and missions for them. This culminated in 1962 with the formation of the Tactical Mobility Requirements Board, which strongly recommended the adaptation of helicopters in a variety of roles and missions. In 1963, the 11th Air Assault Division was activated to test a number of the Board's concepts and recommendations about air mobility. Because the 155mm howitzers then assigned to Army divisions as medium support artillery were not transportable by helicopters, the concept of aerial rocket artillery (ARA) was developed as a substitute.Tolson, p. 23.Stanton, Shelby. Anatomy of a Division. Presidio, 1987. p. 203. The original test unit for rocket-armed helicopters within the 11th Air Assault Division was the 2nd Battalion, 42nd Artillery (later designated the 3rd Battalion, 377th Artillery). When the 11th Air Assault was redesignated as the 1st Cavalry Division and sent to Vietnam, the 3/377th became the 2nd Battalion, 20th Artillery (using the radio call sign \\"Blue Max\\").Stanton, p. 28; 258. This was the first unit designated and organized as ARA to take part in combat operations. The 4/77th Artillery joined the 101st Airborne Division in 1969 when the 101st was converted to an airmobile division, becoming the second active ARA battalion. Battery F, 79th Artillery, was formed to serve with the separate 3d Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division when the rest of the division was withdrawn from Vietnam. It was the final ARA unit to see combat service. Organization and equipment An early UH-1B in an ARA configuration without door guns. An AH-1G assigned to 3/4 Cavalry. It is in gunship, not ARA, configuration. While there are current U.S. Army aviation units with an attack mission (such as the combat aviation brigade), ARA was unique because it was controlled by division artillery and not the aviation group (or an aviation brigade to use 2012 U.S. Army terminology). This allowed the artillery commander (usually a colonel) to coordinate ARA activities with other fire support missions (howitzers, air strikes, and so on).Stanton, pp. 202-203. ARA was not the only location for attack helicopters within the Vietnam-era airmobile division (both the cavalry squadrons and standard lift battalions had attack aviation as part of their organization; with 12 gunships in Company D of each lift battalion and attack helicopters in each air cavalry troop), but it was the most concentrated and centralized element of attack aviation.Stanton, pp. 200-201. Each ARA battalion consisted of one H&HB; (Headquarters & Headquarters Battery) and three firing batteries (Alpha, Bravo and Charlie). A firing battery was equipped with 12 attack helicopters. Initially the units were supplied with Bell UH-1B and UH-1C model helicopters, but these were replaced with the newer AH-1G HueyCobra as they became available. According to one historian's authoritative account of the First Cavalry Division's actions in Vietnam, the conversion to Cobras gave the 2/20th ARA \\"the firepower equivalent to three conventional artillery batteries.\\" The primary weapon of the ARA units was the 2.75\\" Folding Fin Aerial Rocket (FFAR). While the B and C model UH-1s could carry up to 48 of these rockets in two racks of 24 each (XM-3 subsystem), the faster, more powerful Cobras could carry 76.Ott, pp. 50-51. In addition to the rockets, the UH-1s carried two M60 machine guns mounted in the cargo doors as defensive weapons operated by the aircraft's crew chief and a door gunner, while the Cobras were armed with a 7.62mm minigun and a 40mm grenade launcher in a nose turret.Stanton 1981, p. 293. Some UH-1s were also armed with the AGM-22/SS-11 wire guided missile. Missions An ARA battery could perform any type of fire support mission conducted by conventional artillery, but with a much greater range (limited only by a helicopter's combat radius) than tube artillery. These missions included support of ground troops, landing zone (LZ) preparatory fire, interdiction, and counter-battery fire. In addition to normal artillery missions, the helicopters were also employed as escorts for medevac and re-supply helicopters. They also were teamed with light observation helicopters to perform tactical reconnaissance, although this mission was more commonly performed by the airmobile division's air cavalry squadron. Like all aircraft, ARA units had difficulty conducting missions during bad weather or at night (although this was less of a consideration for the more advanced AH-1G). Tube artillery could fire in any conditions (bad weather, day, or night), and the 1st Cavalry Division ended up having a 155mm howitzer battery (1st Battalion, 30th Artillery) attached to the division in Vietnam to provide medium artillery support in situations when ARA might not be able to fly. The 1st Cavalry Division locally designed and produced slings, allowing the 155mm guns to be moved by their heavy CH-54 \\"Flying Crane\\" helicopters. When the 101st Airborne Division converted to an airmobile unit, the 2nd Battalion, 11th Artillery (155mm) was similarly attached.Stanton 1981, p. 84. Notable achievements ARA participated in both the first and last major battles in Vietnam for US ground troops. UH-1B gunships from the 2/20th provided critical fire support during the Pleiku campaign in 1965,for this, the unit received a Presidential Unit Citation for demonstrating the validity of the ARA concept in combat. The 2/20th would also later be awarded the \\"Valorous Unit Citation\\" in 1967.Coleman, p. 290. In 1971 the 4/77th provided fire support for ARVN units involved in the invasion of Laos (Operation Lam Son 719). At the battle of An Loc, on April 13, 1972, an AH-1G from Battery F, 79th Artillery became the first helicopter in history to engage and destroy an enemy tank, thus helping to secure the helicopter's place on the modern battlefield. Perhaps the greatest lasting accomplishment of ARA was to fully validate the concept of armed helicopters. Evolving from test units, ARA gunships (along with those assigned to lift companies and air cavalry troops) provided a source of supporting fire in Vietnam known for its \\"flexibility, accuracy, and immediate response\\" to any combat situation within range. The AH-1G Cobra was a direct result of the successes of the early armed UH-1Bs and UH-1Cs and remained in service after the last ARA battery was decommissioned.Coleman, pp. 288-290. Further development In 1970 the designation ARA was changed to AFA (Aerial Field Artillery).Ott, p.51. As the Army began reorganizing for new missions, many Vietnam-era units and missions changed shape. The 1st Cavalry Division became a test division for the TRICAP concept (a division that could perform armor, airmobile, and air cavalry missions simultaneously), and later shifted to an armored division. The 101st Airborne Division retained an airmobile (later air assault) role, but during the various reorganizations of the 1970s its AFA/ARA battalion disappeared. With attack aviation folded into the various aviation groups and brigades, ARA ceased to be a core artillery mission.Stanton, p. 246, 251.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 August 1998. Creation and casting In early August 1998, Steven Murphy of Inside Soap reported that Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay) would gain a new love interest in the form of \\"a handsome teacher\\" called Graham. Murphy said \\"But in traditional soap style, all isn't going to exactly to plan with the budding romance.\\" Storylines Graham is a local schoolteacher who looks around Keeper's Cottage after Lady Tara Oakwell (Anna Brecon) evicts Seth Armstrong (Stan Richards) and Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook). When he discovers the reason for the sale, he refuses to buy it. He began dating Rachel Hughes. Graham at first appeared to be a perfect boyfriend for Rachel. He moved in with her and redecorated her home, cooked and even alphabetised her CD collection. But gradually Graham began to take control of Rachel's life. He got her to dress differently and dye her hair auburn so that she resembled his dead wife. Graham later took Rachel for a walk in the countryside and Rachel realised that Graham had an overwhelming desire to control every woman he dated. Rachel tried to escape but Graham tried to force himself on her and she fled away in fear until Graham trapped her on a clifftop. After a short talk, Rachel realised Graham had murdered his wife and made it look like she had committed suicide. Graham then pushed Rachel off the cliff and killed her. He later went to the police station and reported Rachel missing and joined the search to find her to avoid suspicion. When he arrived at the place where she had fallen, Graham pretended to have just come across her body to divert suspicion away from him. Graham pretended to be grief- stricken and told Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) that Rachel had accepted his marriage proposal to her. But Eric had spoken to Rachel the day before her death and knew that she had been thinking of ending her relationship with Graham. Eric was suspicious of Graham and, believing he had killed Rachel, he tried to find incrimination evidence against Graham but was unsuccessful. After Rachel's death Graham moved on to her friend Kathy Glover (Malandra Burrows). Kathy had been engaged to Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade) but Biff was convinced that Kathy was attracted to Graham. In an attempt to break up their relationship Graham actively encouraged Biff to think that there was an attraction between them. Finally on his and Kathy's wedding day Biff saw that Kathy was watching out for Graham to arrive and he decided that as she wasn't committed to him he jilted her at the altar and rode off on his motorbike. With Biff gone Graham could start a relationship with Kathy and they later planned to marry. When Eric accused Graham of murdering Rachel, he left the village with Kathy and took her on a romantic weekend away. While driving with Graham it became clear to Kathy that there was something wrong with Graham and when he realised her suspicions he tried to gain control of the car but it went off the road and teetered on a cliff edge before finally falling over the edge. The car ended up bursting into flames when it landed on the beach and Graham was killed. Kathy managed to get out of the car in the last second and was helped up the cliff by Eric and Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) who had been in pursuit.

Team history Origins and early history Penarth RFC was founded in 1879 by Cyril and Llewellyn Batchelor, sons of Cardiff politician John Batchelor, first named the Batchelor XV. There was another mention of a Penarth team playing in 1877https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4471725/4471729/86/football and again with the formation of a Penarth team in 1880.https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3510297/3510300/45/football%20AND%20penarthhttps://newspapers.library.wales/view/3420641/3420643/7/football%20AND%20penarth It joined with Penarth Dreadnoughts in 1882 and became Penarth Football Club. The team were nicknamed the \\"Donkey Island Butcher Boys\\" or the \\"Seasiders\\". Early games were played on a field which is now occupied by Penarth's All Saints Church. In 1891 the pitch was relocated to land owned by the Earl of Plymouth on Stanwell Road. This was used to grow vegetables during the 1914-18 Great War. Seventeen Penarth RFC players were killed during the war and are commemorated by the Memorial Stand above the clubhouse's Long Room. The club subsequently moved to a field on Lavernock Road owned by Fred Davies of Morristown. Finally the team moved to a permanent home at the Athletics Field, again provided by the Earl of Plymouth for the town's rugby, cricket and hockey teams. International players A number of Penarth RFC players have achieved international caps for Wales and the British Lions, between the late 1880s and the early 1960s. These included Richard Garrett (1888 – 1892), George Rowles (1892) and John M C Dyke (1906). Brothers Len and John Dyke were toured New Zealand with the 1908 Anglo-Welsh team, joined by former Penarth captain Reggie Gibbs. Tommy Garrett and Tommy Crossman played a school-boy international for Wales against England in 1909. Other Penarth players gaining Welsh international caps were Mel Rosser (1924), Jack Bassett (1929–1932), Gomer Hughes (1934) and Frank Trott (1939-1945). Jack Bassett also played all five test matches with the British Lions in 1930. He also played for the Barbarians and captained the Wales team on nine occasions. Elwyn Jones played for the Barbarians against the 1963 All Blacks. The club's successes went into a steady decline from the mid-1970s onwards. Annual games against the Barbarians FC The club traditionally hosted the Barbarians Football Club each year from 1901, for their annual Good Friday fixture. Over the next 75 meetings, Penarth won eleven games, drew four and lost 60. The final Penarth v Barbarians game took place in 1986, though a special centenary commemorative game took place in 2001 before the Barbarians played Wales at the Millennium Stadium.

He sang the original version of the bhajan Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram, and founded the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya on 5 May 1901. He is also credited with arranging India's national song, Vande Mātaram, as it is heard today. His original surname was Gadgil, but as they hailed from the village Palus (near Sangli), they came to be known as the \\"Paluskar\\" family. Early life and background Vishnu Digambar Paluskar was born in a Marathi family of Kurundwad, a small town named falling under the Deccan division of Bombay Presidency during British rule, presently in Maharashtra. His father, Digambar Gopal Paluskar, was a singer of Kirtan (a religious song). He went to a local school in Kurundwad for primary education. But tragedy struck Paluskar at an early age. During a Hindu festival called Datta Jayanti, a fire-cracker burst near his face damaging both his eyes. Being a small town, there was no immediate treatment available and Paluskar lost his eyesight. Nevertheless, he regained it some years later. The king of Miraj recognising the talent in the boy put him under the guidance of Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar, a learned musician. Paluskar trained under him for 12 years until in 1896 the relations between the teacher and student became strained. Musical journey After that Paluskar began touring the country and studied the musical traditions in each part of Northern India. He went from place to place and visited many royal families in cities like Baroda and Gwalior, well known for their patronage of musicians. But he broke a long-standing tradition of Indian music by giving a public concert in Saurashtra and charging a nominal fee. Till then, concerts were given only in palaces or temples. He studied Brijbhasha, a dialect of Hindi, spoken at Mathura. Vishnu Digambar met Pandit Chandan Chaube and learnt Dhrupad music form from him. In 1901, he reached Lahore, where he decided to establish a music school. Gandharva Mahavidyalaya On 5 May 1901, Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar founded the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, a school to impart formal training in Indian classical music with some historical Indian Music. This was a school open to all and one of the first in India to run on public support and donations, rather than royal patronage. It was a challenge to the traditional method where students lived under the same roof with their teachers. Many students from the School's early batches became respected musicians and teachers in North India. This brought respect to musicians, who were treated with disdain earlier. In September 1908, Paluskar went to Bombay (now Mumbai) to establish another branch of the school. As the work-load increased, he shifted the school from Lahore to Bombay. To accommodate all the students, he took loans, built a new building for the school and hostel as well. To settle debts, he gave several public concerts. But while on a concert tour in 1924, Paluskar's creditors attached his properties and auctioned off the school. Death and legacy Paluskar on a 1973 stamp of India Paluskar died on 21 August 1931, three days after his 59th birthday. Today, Paluskar is seen as the musician who brought respect to the profession of classical musicians and took Hindustani classical music out from the traditional Gharana system to the masses. He wrote a book on music called Sangeet Bal Prakash in three volumes, and 18 volumes on ragas as well. His disciples Vinayakrao Patwardhan, Omkarnath Thakur, Narayanrao Vyas, and B. R. Deodhar became renowned classical singers and teachers. His son Dattatreya Vishnu Paluskar was also trained in classical music.

This was the first amendment of the district's policy on searching students since 1994. The rules state that an administrator of the same sex may perform the search if there is a suspicion of a student having an item that is a serious threat to the student body. Michele Merkle, the superintendent, stated \\"I cannot imagine a scenario that would get a search down to undergarments.\\"Woodall, Candy and Nikelle Snader. \\"York Suburban passes strip search policy\\" (). The York Dispatch. November 17, 2014. Retrieved on November 18, 2014. The sole board member voting against the policy was Jennifer Clancy, who serves as the school director. Bullying policy In 2009, the administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the district. The York Suburban School Board prohibits bullying by district students and faculty. The board policy 249 Bullying/Cyberbullying defines bullying and cyberbullying. The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Special education In December 2009, the district administration reported that 382 pupils or 13% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. When a child experiences difficulty within the classroom, screening information will be gathered by the team located within the child's school to determine his or her specific needs. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible make a written request for a multidisciplinary evaluation to the building principal or the Director of Special Education. In 2010, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The School District received a $1,100,541 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Gifted education The District Administration reported that 200 or 7.19% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2011, the average teacher salary in York Suburban School District was $76,513 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $20,075 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $96,589.

Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. By law the state limits the total unreserved-undesignated fund balance at 8% of the annual budget for school districts that have budgets over $19 million a year.

The state also provided a $544.4 million payment for School Employees’ Social Security and $856 million for School Employees’ Retirement fund called PSERS. This amount is a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011-2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, School Employees' Social Security, Pupil Transportation, Nonpublic and Charter School Pupil Transportation. Since taking office, Corbett's first two budgets have restored more than $918 million in support of public schools, compensating for the $1 billion in federal stimulus dollars lost at the end of the 2010-11 school year. In 2011-12, York Suburban School District received a $1,659,882, allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $46,195 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation.

The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 592 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 For the 2010-11 budget year, the York Suburban School District received a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $1,726,755. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in York County was awarded to Hanover Public School District at 8.39%. Among Pennsylvania school districts, the highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $1,692,926. Four school districts in York County received increases of over 6% in Basic Education Funding in 2009. The highest increase was awarded to Central York School District which received 12.54% in 2009. In York County, 12 school districts received a less than 6% increase in state basic education funding in 2009 and three districts received the base 2% increase. Ninety school districts in the commonwealth were given the base 2% increase. Among the 500 school districts in Pennsylvania, Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. In 2008, the York Suburban School District received $1,659,731 in state basic education funding. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 389 students, in the district, received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year. =Accountability Block Grants= Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010-11 the York Suburban School District applied for and received $125,385 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for the 7th year. =Classrooms for the Future grant= The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. York Suburban School District was denied for funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08, it received $110,667 and in 2008-09 it received $45,413 for a total of $156,080 in state funding. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards =Other grants= York Suburban School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education grants, PA Science Its Elementary grants, Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the 21st Century learning grants. Federal Stimulus funding York Suburban School District received an extra $338,739 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The Pennsylvania Department of Education advised the districts to use the money for nonrecurring expenses like purchasing equipment and teaching resources like books, and software. =Race to the Top grant= York Suburban School District officials applied for the Race to the Top federal grant. When approved for the grant, the District would have received millions in additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Six York County school districts applied to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. Common Cents state initiative The York Suburban School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Real estate taxes The school board levied a real estate tax of 20.7122 mills in 2012-13. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the Commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania public school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011-12 - 20.4530 mills. *2010-11 - 20.1710 mills *2009-10 - 19.5080 mills *2008-09 - 18.7400 mills *2007-08 - 17.6880 mills. *2006-07 - 16.8340 mills. *2005-06 - 18.5700 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by York County residents amounts to about 4.01% of their yearly income. York County ranked 232nd of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. =Act 1 Adjusted index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the York Suburban School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 3.9%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 3.4%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 4.4%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 4.1%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 2.9%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.4%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2011 *2013-14 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012 For the 2013-14 budget year, York Suburban School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2013-2014, 311 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 171 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 89 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. Eleven districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2012-13 budget year, York Suburban School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the 2011-12 school year, the York Suburban School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, York Suburban School Board has the option of adopting either: 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The York Suburban School Board applied for several exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2010-11 for special education costs and pension obligation. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. =Property tax relief= In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Suburban York School District was $113 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 5,853 property owners applied for the tax relief. In 2009, the district's property tax relief amount was set at $114 to 6,816 approved homestead owners. In 2010 within York County, the highest amount went to York City School District set at $495 per approved homestead. The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $641 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. CUSD was given $632 in 2009. This was the third year they were the top recipient. In Pennsylvania, the homestead exclusion reduces the assessed values of homestead properties, reducing the property tax on these homes. The homestead exclusion allows homeowners real property tax relief of up to one half of the median assessed value of homesteads in the taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, city, borough, or township). Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars York Suburban School District's students have access to a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by the school board policy. According to a report published in the York Dispatch, the district initiated a $25 fee to participate in sports in 2011–12. In 2011 the district reported spending over $819,000 to provide its extensive sports program.Stouch, Todd., Who's paying to play, York Dispatch, September 15, 2011 York School District spent $62,906 for the transportation of sports teams in 2011-12. This was a $8,000 increase over sports transport spending in 2010-11. Countywide nearly $1 million was spent on transporting public school sports teams.Vanolinda, Dick., York County schools struggle to control sports travel costs, York Dispatch, December 12, 2012 The total sports budget grew to $711,149 in 2010-11 and $819,371 in 2011-12. Collectively, York County public schools spent over $9 million on sports budgets (does not include facility costs) in 2011-12.Dick VanOlinda,, Pay-to-play a growing trend in area school districts, The York Dispatch, May 23, 2012 By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the District, including those who attend a private school, a cyber charter school, a charter school and those who are home-schooled, are all eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics.

One of the world's most-photographed women in the late 1950s and early 1960s, at the height of her career she was called \\"the most photographed nude in America\\". Life and career June Wilkinson was born 27 March 1940 in Eastbourne, England. Having started as a stage performer at the age of 12, she went on to become the youngest topless dancer, at the age of 15, at the Windmill Theatre in London from 1957 to 1958. During a promotional tour in the United States, she was discovered by Hugh Hefner. Her first appearance in Playboy, in September 1958, was titled \\"The Bosom\\".Wilkinson, p.43. She was a brunette in those days, but in later shoots she was a blonde. Wilkinson's second Playboy appearance was photographed by Russ Meyer. Meyer was an independent photographer at the time, and filming his ground-breaking The Immoral Mr. Teas (1959). Because she was under contract to Seven Arts at the time, Wilkinson could not officially appear in Meyer's film. However, as an uncredited and unpaid favor to the director, Wilkinson's breasts can be seen through a window in one scene. Wilkinson appeared in Playboy again in August 1959 in a spread titled \\"The Bosom in Hollywood.\\" During this period, she appeared with Spike Jones' band, together with actor Billy Barty. Recalling this period in her career, Wilkinson later remembered Barty with affection, but commented that off-stage, Jones had no sense of humor. In 1960, Wilkinson was featured in Playboy five times, in June, July, August, October, and again in November. Her feature in the November issue was titled \\"The Bosom Revisits Playboy\\".Wilkinson, p.46. Wilkinson appeared in the 1960 voodoo film, Macumba Love, which promoted her measurements as \\"44-20-36\\". At times reported as up to \\"45-22-35\\", in 1963 Wilkinson stated that her measurements were actually \\"40-22-35\\". In 1961 Wilkinson made several stage appearances on the U.S. West coast with performers such as Louis Jourdan in The Marriage-Go-Round, Sylvia Sidney in Come Blow Your Horn and Milton Berle in Norman, Is That You?.Wilkinson, p.47. She had a brief role in John Cassavetes' 1962 film, Too Late Blues. In December 1962, Wilkinson made her last appearance in Playboy, though her photos continued to appear in the magazine in anniversary and retrospective features. Though she was never an official Playboy Playmate, she was featured in the magazine on seven separate occasions and was one of the magazine's most popular photo subjects. She appeared in more than fifty other men's magazines and newspapers from 1958 to 1970, making her one of the most- photographed models of the era. Wilkinson was the star of director Myron Gold's 1963 film, La Rabia or The Rage. Directed in Mexico City, the film has Wilkinson as a stripper with a gigolo boyfriend. She met Dan Pastorini, NFL quarterback for the Houston Oilers and Oakland Raiders in 1972, and they were married in 1973.Wilkinson, p.48. They co-starred in the 1974 film Florida Connection (also known as Weed), for the producer of Rage. The couple divorced in 1982, and Wilkinson never remarried.Wilkinson, p.49. She has a daughter, Brahna. In the 1970s-1980s Wilkinson starred in a series of sex comedy teasers, such as \\"Three in a Bedroom\\", \\"The Ninety-Day Mistress\\" (with Eve McVeagh) and \\"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\\" In 1997, in her late 50s, June came back for another nude shoot in The Best of Glamour Girls: Then and Now vol. 2 (Winter 1997). In 1999 when Playboy published its list of the \\"100 Sexiest Stars of the Century\\", June came in at #30. Currently she hosts The Directors, a cable show in which she interviews filmmakers. She is also putting together a show about the history of fashion called Glamour's First 5000 Years.

He was an adherent of Gregory VII and an advocate of the reforming principles of that pope. He wrote three works of polemical history, detailing the struggles between civil and religious authorities. He was driven out of both of his dioceses, once by the emperor and once by opponents of Gregorian-style reform. Life Bonizo was born about 1045, though there is no documentary material referring to the date of his birth, or the place, or of his family.Lehmgrübner, p. 129: Die gleichzeitigen Berichte über Bonizo geben von der Zeit seiner Geburt, von seinem Geburtsort, seiner Abstammung oder seiner Familie kein Wort. It is argued that he was a native of Milan in Northern Italy.Dümmler considers it probable that he was a native of Cremona. E. Dümmler (ed.), \\"Bonizonis episcopi Sutrini Liber ad amicum,\\" in: Monumenta Germaniae Historica 1 Scriptores. 6 Libelli 01. Libelli de Lite Imperatorum et Pontificum (Hannover: Hahn 1891), p. 568. Lehmgrübner, pp. 130-132, argues the case for Cremona in detail. Early in his life he associated himself with the reform group known as the Pataria. Bonizo took part in several councils held in Rome. He was present in Rome at a synod of Pope Alexander II, probably the one held in February or March 1073.Bonizo, Liber ad amicum VI. E. Dümmler, p. 600. Robinson, p. 38. On 27 November 1074, Pope Gregory wrote a letter to Bishop Dionysius of Piacenza, advising him that he was sending legates (who were carrying the letter) in order to settle several long-running disputes which raged in that diocese, and occasioned accusations in the Papal Court. These disputes included the Bishop, on the one side, and the Abbot of S. Sepulcro; the People of Piacenca; and the subdeacon Bonizo.Kehr, p. 447, no. 22.

Bishop Dionysius was the leading opponent in Lombardy of the reforming party of which Gregory VII had just become the head. It is conjectured that the subdeacon was the future Bonizo of Sutri.Robinson, p. 37., with note 229. Philipp Jaffé expresses his uncertainty in his edition of Bonizo's ad amicum, in: Bibliotheca rerum Germanicarum II, at p. 577, note 1. Berschin (1972), at p. 7, note 20, says that the identification \\"seems possible\\". Bonizo was present at the Roman synod of February 1075, in which Bishop Dionysius was deposed.Lehmgrübner, p. 139. Kehr, p. 447, no. 23-24. Robinson, p. 37. He was soon appointed by the Pope to the episcopal see of Sutri. The earliest reference to him as Bishop of Sutri is found in the dedicatory inscription of the church of S. Thomas in Cremona, on 3 October 1078. He was serving as papal legate at the time.Robinson, p. 38. He was present in Rome during the discussions about the doctrines concerning the eucharist promoted by Berengar of Tours, just before the Roman synod of November 1078.Robinson, p. 38. In the struggle between Gregory VII and Emperor Henry IV he was on the side of the pope. He was seized by Henry in late April 1082, and entrusted to the custody of the antipope Clement III, Archbishop Wibert of Ravenna. About a year afterwards Bonizo made his escape, and lived for several years under the protection of Countess Matilda of Tuscany.Dümmler, pp. 568-569. Robinson, p. 39. In 1086 he was present in Mantua at the funeral of his friend Anselm of Lucca, who had died on 18 March 1086.Vita Anselmi episcopi Lucensis chapters 40-42, in: Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptorum Tomus XII (Hannover: Hahn 1856), pp. 24-25. Robinson, p. 39. He was, soon after, elected to the see of Piacenza by the Pataria, but owing to strong opposition was unable to take possession of it until the year 1088, when he was strongly supported by Pope Urban II. His enemies, however, contrived to have him blinded and maimed in July 1090.It is reported by the monk and chronicler Bernoldus of S. Blasius, under the year 1089, that he had his eyes gouged out and his limbs cut off: post multastas captiones, tribulationes et exilia a Placcntinis catholicis pro episcopo recipitur; set a scismaticis eiusdem loci effossis oculis, truncatis omnibus paene membris martirio coronatur. Dümmler, p. 569, note 8. Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptorum Tomus V (Hannover: Hahn 1844), p. 449. He seems to have died in Cremona in 1094 or 1095.Walter Berschin (1972), p. 18 note 68, argues that Bonizo died in 1094. P. Fournier (1915), p. 270, argued for 1095.

It is an acidic viscous liquid with a pKa of 4.5. It is very soluble in water, soluble in ethanol and diethyl ether. Upon distillation, it dehydrates to form acrylic acid, and is occasionally called hydracrylic acid 3-Hydroxypropionic acid is used in the industrial production of various chemicals such as acrylates. It can be produced by engineered microbes. Applications in producing a biodegradable polymer A method has been developed by the University of Minnesota to produce a biodegradable polymer polyester known as poly(3-hydroxypropionic acid). The method combines the high-molecular weight and control aspects of ring-opening polymerization with the commercial availability of the beta hydroxy acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid which is abbreviated as 3-HP. Since 3-HP can be derived from biological sources, the resulting material, poly(3-hydroxypropionic acid) or P(3-HP), is biorenewable. The new method allows direct synthesis of the bio-based polymer P(3-HP) from 3-HP, a commercial monomer that is derived from corn. The method uses a single vessel reactor for simple synthesis and rapid scale up. The method results in a higher molecular weight which makes the polymer more structurally sound using a process with lower toxicity than competing technologies. The market for a bio-based and biodegradable replacement for polyester is expected to grow rapidly during the next five years. The bio- based polyester, P(3-HP), has attractive mechanical properties, such as rigidity, ductility, and exceptional tensile strength in drawn films and can be created using the new lower toxicity method. On account of these properties, P(3-HP) has applications in packaging or biodegradable plastics. Genetically encoded 3-hydroxypropionic acid inducible system A genetically encoded 3-hydroxypropionic acid inducible system has been characterized in bacteria demonstrating that such system in combination with fluorescent reporter protein can be utilized as a biosensor to measure intracellular and extracellular 3-HP concentrations by fluorescence output.

The Charity works in partnership with music and arts organisations to offer a range of learning and participation activities to the local community and to the wider public. Activities began before the construction of the building finished and are growing steadily year by year. KPMF offers access to creative spaces and activities for both new and established audiences with affordable prices for all. The KMPF music programme is funded entirely by revenue from ticket sales and income generated through event and conference hire, and without reliance on public funding. Location Kings Place sits on the east side of York Way, 150 metres from King's Cross/St Pancras train stations. On its eastern side the building overlooks Battlebridge Basin on the Regent's Canal which is also home to many residential boats and the London Canal Museum. Central St Martins, one of the art colleges within the University of the Arts London, brought a major visual arts community into the area from mid-2011, when it moved into the nearby Argent's King's Cross Central development. Architectural philosophy Following a limited architectural competition, Dixon Jones was appointed as the architect for Kings Place. The brief was for it to be a large building of far higher quality than the normal spec office development. The building was to be durable, not only in terms of quality of the build materials, but in its design. It had to be spatially generous and environmentally impeccable. Most importantly, it had to fit into a local urban architecture which is not uniform in scale. Features The building has wavy glass runs along the west-facing York Way frontage; this three-layered glass façade is a free-standing transparent surface made up of hundreds of very slightly curved sheets of glass. As well as reducing heat gain from the afternoon sun and increasing wind resistance, the glass wall provides Kings Place with a distinctive facade. Facilities *Hall One – 415-seat concert hall with fixed seating *Hall Two – flexible performance and rehearsal space (seats audience of 200 or 330 standing) *St Pancras Room – auditorium for speech, seating 100 *Three rehearsal break-out spaces: **Limehouse Room **Wenlock Room **Horsfall Room *Recording and broadcasting facilities *General dressing rooms *Office space and headquarters for London Sinfonietta and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment *The Music Base – shared office space with desks for small music organisations *Pangolin London: **Sculpture gallery Hall One Hall One, the main concert hall, is a separate structure within the building, it is a box that sits on rubber springs to give it complete acoustic separation from the rest of the building. It is built to a regular geometry, a double cube, that is considered most successful for small concert halls. Structural columns around the hall are set away from the walls to allow curtains to be drawn between the columns and the walls to modify the acoustics for speech or amplified music. It won the \\"Commercial and Public Access\\" award and the overall \\"Gold Award\\" in the 2009 Wood Awards. Acoustics The architecture of Hall One emerged from a collaboration between Dixon Jones and Arup's acousticians. As part of the research that preceded the design, the developer, the architects, the engineers and the project manager visited Japan to look in detail at a dozen concert halls. The aim was to differentiate very precisely between a variety of modern concert halls and to examine what solution would best meet the requirements of Kings Place. Next a computer model of the proposed Kings Place auditorium was made. This was tested against computer models of the Concertgebouw, the Wigmore and several other halls. In this way it was possible to optimise the design for Hall One before construction began. Oak veneer The oak veneer inside Hall One has come from the same 500-year-old German oak tree named Contessa. After felling the wood was cut into 5-metre lengths and boiled at 80 °C for one week, then sliced. The tree produced an acre of wood veneer. It has been used in Hall One to cover the panels, columns, roof coffers, the back of seats, and doors. Food and drink The Rotunda Restaurant spans the area of the building facing Regent's Canal and Battlebridge Basin. The Rotunda Bar features a curved bar that mirrors the shape of the building. The Green & Fortune Café is housed in the central atrium of the building on the ground floor level. Green & Fortune is responsible for all food, drink, and hospitality at Kings Place. Offices All seven levels above ground at Kings Place are commercial office space. From some angles Kings Place can be seen as four joined but separate structures. This breaking down of the mass of the building was critical to the planners and has allowed light and a sense of openness to penetrate to basement level. Thanks to a series of linking bridges, however, each of the upper floors is experienced by the office user as a very large contiguous plate. For the office users no staircase was provided for general use so the only way to access above ground floors is via the lifts. This makes for inconvenience when the lifts break down and reduces the green impact of the building. The two common staircases have been designed so as only to be available in case of fire. Outreach programme Kings Place promotes discovery of the arts in its surrounding boroughs of Islington and Camden. The Kings Place outreach programme works in three areas: Education, Community Engagement and Participation and Family. Music and arts organisations resident and performing at Kings Place offer educational classes, workshops, opportunities for participation in performances as well as family events. Past events and projects have included family drumming workshops and professional development sessions with the London Sinfonietta and their visiting musicians from the Ugandan Dance Academy and a visual arts project with local schools and the Visual Learning Foundation using the construction of the building as inspiration.

Some of his works were published under the pen name Andrei Moscovit. Together with , Sergei Dovlatov, , and , he founded the Leningrad writers' group \\"Townspeople\\" (), whose works circulated in samizdat. He was also the founder of Hermitage Publishers; a company specializing in Russian writers.  Biography  In 1960, he graduated from the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute. He then attended the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute; graduating in 1973. He joined the Union of Soviet Writers in 1965. He originally wrote stories for children and pieces for Soviet radio and television as well as screenplays. It was not known until after he left the Soviet Union, in 1978 by way of Austria, that he had written Practical Metaphysics and Metapolitics under the pseudonym Andrei Moscovit. After arriving in the United States, he worked for Ardis Publishing until 1981, when he established his own company to print works, both contemporary and classic, that could not be published in the USSR. The writers who were first presented by Heritage include Sergei Averintsev, Vasily Aksyonov, Fridrikh Gorenstein, Lev Losev, Anatoly Naiman, Ernst Neizvestny and . Since 1991, most of his works have appeared in Russia. Many originally appeared in the literary journal Zvezda (Star). In 2005, he published The Noble Prankster, a memoir of Joseph Brodsky. This was followed by a new work of philosophy, The Shameful Mystery of Inequality. Five of his works are available in English and a book on the Assassination of President Kennedy was published in France. All the critics who have written about Yefimov have noted the philosophical nature of his prose; Brodsky described him as belonging \\"to the great Russian tradition of philosophical writers in the vein of Herzen.\\"Panconesi, Emiliano, and Irina Dvisova, \\"La letteratura riabilitata: da Nabokov e Cvetaeva a Solženicyn e Brodskij\\".

Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Vipera aspis francisciredi is a venomous viper subspecies endemic to northern and central Italy and adjacent Croatia, Slovenia, and Switzerland.Mallow D, Ludwig D, Nilson G. 2003. True Vipers: Natural History and Toxinology of Old World Vipers. Malabar, Florida: Krieger Publishing Company, Malabar. 359 pp. . Etymology The subspecific name, francisciredi, is in honor of Francesco Redi, an Italian physician who was a pioneer in experimental toxinology. Description The head is distinctly swollen behind the eyes and upper lips; in adults, this feature is clearly visible when viewed from above. Regarding the color pattern, many examples of this subspecies have a white or cream- colored spot near the outer edge of each ventral scale; these spots are smaller in V. a. aspis (if at all present), but much more apparent in V. a. francisciredi. Geographic range V. a. francisciredi near Pienza, Italy Street (1979) describes this subspecies as inhabiting most of Italy, where it is the most common and widely distributed venomous snake. It also occurs in the Swiss canton of Ticino, south of the Monte Ceneri Pass, but is not found west of nearby Lake Maggiore. Also in the north, in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, it can be found as far north as Meran, but is not found in Austria, and as far east as Gorizia (on the border with Slovenia). In the south of Italy, it is absent from Basilicata and Calabria. In the former Yugoslavia, it is a rare inhabitant of the Julian Alps (Pozzi, 1966). There have been reports of specimens from Ripanj near Belgrade, Jahorin in Bosnia and other parts of \\"Yugoslavia\\", but some of these may have been confused with V. berus bosniensis.Street D. 1979. The Reptiles of Northern and Central Europe. London: B.T. Batsford Ltd. 268 pp. . Nevertheless, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) describes the range of this subspecies as stretching from southern Switzerland, northern and central Italy, to Slovenia and northwestern Croatia. The type locality listed by Laurenti (1768) for Vipera Francisci Redi (= V. a. francisciredi) is \\"Austriaco & Italico\\" (= Austria and Italy). Conservation status The whole species is classified as Least Concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (v3.1, 2008).Vipera aspis at IUCN Red List. Accessed 31 July 2020.

Born in Manchester, England he is an established author with BBC Radio Drama and was a question-setter on the UK game show Bacha Hi O'Ma! (the Welsh equivalent of Blind Date) but is perhaps best known for his acclaimed translation of Caradog Prichard's Welsh language novel Un Nos Ola Leuad, as One Moonlit Night (). The translation was adapted for broadcast as a radio play (by Mitchell himself) and was transmitted on BBC Radio 4. It was also adapted for the stage and was performed at several theatres including Theatr Clwyd in Wrexham, Theatr Gwynedd in Bangor, and The Young Vic in London. Mitchell discovered Prichard's novel when studying Welsh A-level (for which it was a set text) and was surprised to find that it had never been translated fully into English. Indeed, there were those who claimed the novel could not be translated into English as it is written entirely in a dialect common in the Bethesda district of North Wales (where Prichard was born) but little-known outside that area. Canongate Press in Edinburgh first accepted the translation for publication but the rights to publish Mitchell's translation were later acquired by publishers Penguin Books in London and New Directions in New York City.

He has been interviewed by PBS Newshour, BBC, and The New York Times on the Vioxx wrongful death cases and other torts cases. As an author of the casebook Tort Law: Responsibilities and Redress (along with professors John C. P. Goldberg and Anthony Sebok), he is nationally recognized as a scholar on torts. He is also a noted scholar in jurisprudence and legal philosophy, having introduced Civil Recourse Theory in the 1998 article Rights, Wrongs, and Recourse in the Law of Torts. Contrary to economic theorists, Zipursky argues that tort law is about legal wrongs and legal rights, not just about economic efficiency. Contrary to corrective justice theorists, he argues that private law is more about empowering individuals to seek redress for wrongs, and less about compensating for losses. Since 1998, Zipursky, along with collaborator and co-author Goldberg, has published a book and numerous articles, essays, and book chapters on civil recourse theory. Civil recourse theory has generated several conferences and commentaries from judges and academics in the United States and abroad. Zipursky has twice served as Associate Dean at Fordham University School of Law, where he currently holds the James H. Quinn '49 Chair in Legal Ethics. He has taught as a Visiting Professor at Columbia Law School, Harvard Law School, and Vanderbilt University School of Law. In addition to products liability law, tort law, and philosophical theory of private law, his scholarly work also addresses analytic legal philosophy, legal ethics, and constitutional theory.

Background Michael Wallace was born January 1, 1951, in Biloxi, Mississippi. He received his bachelor's degree cum laude from Harvard University in 1973. In 1976, he graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law, where he served on the Virginia Law Review and was named to the Order of the Coif. Wallace then clerked for Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Harry G. Walker from 1976 until 1977 and then-Associate Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist from 1977 until 1978. From 1980 to 1981, Wallace worked as a research analyst for the United States House of Representatives House Republican Research Committee. From 1980 to 1983, he worked as the counsel for the Office of the Republican Whip in the U.S. House under future Mississippi senator Trent Lott. Wallace was a legislative consultant to the Administrative Conference of the United States from 1984 to 1994. The Conference's primary responsibility was to examine administrative processes in Congress and federal agencies for the purpose of recommending improvements. From 1984 to 1990, Mr. Wallace served as a board member of the Legal Services Corporation, a private, non-profit corporation established by Congress to promote the availability of legal services to the indigent.

For a substantial time he was a partner at Phelps Dunbar LLP, also in Jackson. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush considered Mr. Wallace for nomination to the federal bench. His name was submitted to the American Bar Association for review, and some civil rights organizations expressed their opposition. The nomination never came before Congress. He is currently a shareholder with the firm of Wise, Carter, Child & Caraway in Jackson, Mississippi.http://www.wisecarter.com/attorney/michael-b-wallace Fifth Circuit nomination under Bush On February 8, 2006, President George W. Bush nominated Wallace to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to fill the seat vacated when Charles W. Pickering. Pickering was a recess appointment to the Court in January 2004, and retired at the end of that year. Wallace was opposed by the Senate Democrats and various advocacy groups, who asserted Wallace had tried to undermine meaningful enforcement of the U.S. civil rights laws. In addition, as chair of the Legal Services Corporation, Wallace had been criticized by from Democrats and a few moderate Republicans for seeking to undermine the agency. He authorized the use of LSC funds to lobby Congress for cuts in LSC's budget and to pay lawyers to prepare a memo arguing for LSC's abolition. Republican Senator Warren Rudman characterized Wallace's appeal to Congress as \\"absolutely bad faith.\\" The American Bar Association's judicial-evaluations committee determined that Wallace \\"has the highest professional competence\\" and \\"possesses the integrity to serve on the bench,\\" but gave him a \\"not qualified\\" rating, finding him lacking on the element of \\"judicial temperament.\\" Senate Republicans blamed the \\"not qualified\\" rating on liberal bias within the American Bar Association's leadership and judicial-evaluations committee.

P. Lovecraft, on August 14, 1921.\\"Lovecraft's Fiction\\", The H. P. Lovecraft Archive. It was first published in the November 1933 issue of The Fantasy Fan.\\"H. P. Lovecraft’s 'The Other Gods'\\", The H. P. Lovecraft Archive. Plot Barzai the Wise, a high priest and prophet greatly learned in the lore of the \\"gods of earth\\", or Great Ones, attempts to scale the mountain of Hatheg-Kla in order to look upon their faces, accompanied by his young disciple Atal. Upon reaching the peak, Barzai at first seems overjoyed until he finds that the \\"gods of the earth\\" are not there alone, but rather are overseen by the \\"other gods, the gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble gods of earth!\\" Atal flees, and Barzai is never seen again. Characters Atal Atal first appears in Lovecraft's \\"The Cats of Ulthar\\" (1920) as the young son of an innkeeper in Ulthar who witnesses the weird rites of the cats on the night that the old cotter and his wife are killed. In \\"The Other Gods\\", he becomes the apprentice of Barzai the Wise and accompanies him on his doomed climb to the top of Mount Hatheg-Kla to see the gods. When Randolph Carter visits Atal in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (1926), he is the patriarch of the Temple of the Elder Ones and is now well over 300 years old, \\"but still very keen of mind and memory\\". After many draughts of moon-wine, he reveals an important piece of information that helps Carter in his quest. As befits his age and station, Atal sports a long beard. Barzai In \\"The Other Gods\\", Barzai the Wise is high-priest of the Gods of Earth (the Great Ones) in Ulthar and one-time teacher of Atal. According to the story, he often delved into the unknown, reading such works as the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan. He is the son of an aristocrat, which makes him skeptical of commoners' superstitions. He is said to have advised the burgesses of Ulthar when they passed their ban on cat-slaying. He vanishes shortly after climbing to the top of Hatheg-Kla to see the gods reveling on its peak. In \\"The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\\", Nyarlathotep himself speaks to Randolph Carter in a brief and sardonic fashion of the ill-fated expeditions of other impertinent god-seekers, and therein relates that when Barzai's hubris brought him to the baleful attention of the Other Gods, they \\"did what was expected\\". Sansu According to the story, Sansu is \\"written of with fright\\" in the Pnakotic Manuscripts, having once scaled the mountain of Hatheg-Kla \\"in the youth of the world\\" and found \\"naught but wordless ice and rock\\". He is the last person to have climbed the mountain before Barzai. Setting Though some readers assume that \\"The Other Gods\\" is set in Lovecraft's Dreamlands, critic S. T. Joshi points out the connections to the story \\"Polaris\\", which seems to be set in Earth's distant past, in arguing that \\"the clear implication is that this tale too takes place in a prehistoric civilization.\\"Joshi, p. 21. *Hatheg-Kla is a \\"high and rocky\\" mountain in the \\"stony desert\\" thirteen days' walk from the village of Hatheg, for which it is named. It is one of the places where the \\"gods of earth\\" once dwelt and sometimes return to when they are homesick. *\\"White-capped Thurai\\" is another of the mountains where the gods of earth used to dwell.

Its center was in Athens, and from there the style spread among the trading cities of the Aegean. The Greek Dark Ages are also called the Geometric period in reference to this characteristic pottery style, although the historical period is much longer than the art-historical period, being circa 1100 – 800 BC. The vases had various uses or purposes within Greek society, including, but not limited to, funerary vases and symposium vases. Funerary context Funerary vases not only depicted funerary scenes, but they also had practical purposes, either holding the ashes or being used as grave markers. Relatives of the deceased conducted burial rituals that included three parts: the prothesis (laying out of the body), the ekphora (funeral procession), and the interment of the body or cremated remains of the body. To the Greeks, an omission of a proper burial was an insult to proper dignity. The mythological context of a proper burial relates to the Greeks' belief in a continued existence in the underworld that will disallow the dead to maintain peace in the absence of a proper burial ritual. Aside from its funerary use, the Greeks also utilized various vessels during symposiums. The Greek symposium was a social gathering that only aristocratic males were allowed to attend. Vessels, such as wine coolers, jugs, various drinking cups, and mixing vessels, were decorated with Greek, geometric scenes. Some of the scenes depicted drinking parties or Dionysus and his followers. The symposia would be held in the “andron,” which was a man’s only room. The only women allowed into this room were called “hetaera,” or female sex-workers who required payment from their regular, male companions. Pottery in the Geometric style Protogeometric period During the Protogeometric period (1050–900 BC), the shapes of the vessels have eliminated the fluid nature of the Mycenaean; creating a more strict and simple design. There are horizontal, decorative bands that feature geometric shapes, including, but not limited to, concentric circles or semicircles. Technological developments caused a new relationship between ornament and structure; causing differing stylistic choice from its Mycenaean influences. The Protogeometric period did not yet feature human figures within its art, but horses were pictured during this time period. Common vase shapes of the period include amphorae with the handles on both the belly and the neck, hydriai (water jars), oinochoai (lit. wine jug), lekythoi, and skyphoi (stemless cups). Early Geometric period In the Early Geometric period (900–850 BC), the height of the vessels had been increased, while the decoration is limited around the neck down to the middle of the body of the vessel. The remaining surface is covered by a thin layer of clay, which during the firing takes a dark, shiny, metallic color.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 35th and 36th Books That was the period when the decorative theme of the meander was added to the pottery design, the most characteristic element of Geometric art. During this period, a broader repertoire of vessel shapes was initiated. Specifically, amphorae were used to hold cremation ashes. The amphorae featured handles on the \\"neck/shoulder\\" for males, while they feature handles on the \\"belly\\" of the vase for women. Middle Geometric period By the Middle Geometric period (850–760 BC), the decorative zones appear multiplied due to the creation of a laced mesh, while the meander dominates and is placed in the most important area, in the metope, which is arranged between the handles. Late Geometric period The Dipylon Amphora, mid-8th century BC, with human figures. National Archaeological Museum, Athens While the technique from the Middle Geometric period was still continued at the beginning of the 8th century BC, some potters enriched again the decorative organization of the vases, stabilized the forms of the animals in the areas of the neck and the base of the vase, and introduced between the handles, the human form. The Late Geometric Period was marked by a 1.62 meter amphora that was made by the Dipylon painter at around 760-750 BC. The vase was a grave marker to an aristocratic woman in the Dipylon cemetery. This was the first phase of the Late Geometric period (760–700 BC), in which the great vessels of Dipylon ware placed on the graves as funeral monuments,Woodford, Susan. (1982) The Art of Greece and Rome. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 40. and represent with their height (often at a height of 1.50 m) and the perfection of their execution, the highest expression of the Greek Geometric art. The focal point of the funerary vases (kraters) was now the body lying in state (prothesis) and the wail of the dead (Amphora in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens), carrying out to the grave with an honorary chariot race (Krater in the Athens National Archaeological Museum), and various other subjects thought to be related to similar descriptions of the Homeric epics. Detail of a chariot from a late Geometric krater attributed to the Trachones workshop on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art People and animals are depicted geometrically in a dark glossy color, while the remaining vessel is covered by strict zones of meanders, crooked lines, circles, swastikas, in the same graphical concept. Later, the main tragic theme of the wail declined, the compositions eased, the geometric shapes have become more freely, and areas with animals, birds, scenes of shipwrecks, hunting scenes, themes from mythology or the Homeric epics led Geometric pottery into more naturalistic expressions.Geometric periods of pottery at Greek-thesaurus.gr One of the characteristic examples of the Late Geometric style is an oldest surviving signed work of a Greek potter Aristonothos (or Aristonophos) (7th century BC). The vase was found at Cerveteri in Italy and illustrates the blinding of Polyphemus by Odysseus and his companions. From the mid-8th century BC, the closer contact between Greece and the East enriched the ceramic art with new subjects – such as lions, panthers, imaginary beings, rosettes, palmettes, lotus flowers etc. – that led to the Orientalizing Period style, in which the pottery style of Corinth distinguished. Narrative art The notion of narrative during this time period exists between the artist and the audience. The artist communicates with the viewer, but the viewer’s interpretation can sometime be an inaccurate interpretation. Furthermore, multiple interpretations of a singular artwork can be created by the viewer. A combination of historical, mythological, and societal context is needed to interpret the stories told within Greek Geometric art. The artwork during the geometric period can be seen as \\"supplementary sources and illustrative materials for Greek mythology and Greek literature.\\" The scenes that are depicted within Greek Geometric art contain various interpretations through analysis of the depicted scenes. Art historians must decide if the stylistic choices that were made during this time period were for a specific reason or simply coincidental. Motifs ekphora, the act of carrying a body to its grave. National Archaeological Museum, Athens Vases in the Geometric style are characterized by several horizontal bands about the circumference covering the entire vase. Between these lines the geometric artist used a number of other decorative motifs such as the zigzag, the triangle, the meander and the swastika. Besides abstract elements, painters of this era introduced stylized depictions of humans and animals which marks a significant departure from the earlier Protogeometric Art. Many of the surviving objects of this period are funerary objects, a particularly important class of which are the amphorae that acted as grave markers for aristocratic graves, principally the Dipylon Amphora by the Dipylon Master who has been credited with a number of kraters and amphorae from the late geometric period. Linear designs were the principal motif used in this period. The meander pattern was often placed in bands and used to frame the now larger panels of decoration. The areas most used for decoration by potters on shapes such as the amphorae and lekythoi were the neck and belly, which not only offered the greatest liberty for decoration but also emphasized the taller dimensions of the vessels. The first human figures appeared around 770 BC on the handles of vases. The human forms are easily distinguished because they do not overlap with one another, making the painted black forms discernible from one another against the color of the clay body. The male was depicted with a triangular torso, an ovoid head with a blob for a nose and long cylindrical thighs and calves. Female figures were also abstract. Their long hair was depicted as a series of lines, as were their breasts, which appeared as strokes under the armpit. Techniques Two techniques of this time period include red figure pottery and black figure pottery. The black figure pottery started around 700 B.C., and it remained the dominant style until its successor, red figure pottery, was invented around 530 B.C. The switch from black figure pottery to red figure pottery was made due to the enhanced detail that red figured pottery allowed its artists.

In 1282 Gemen becomes a fief of the Counts of Cleves. The Lords of Gemen became extinct in 1492, and Gemen passed to Counts of Schaumburg and Holstein-Pinneberg through the heiress Cordula of Gemen, to form the County of Schaumburg and Gemen.

The training and friendships he made at the École shaped his entire career. After graduating, he spent a short time in New York City with prominent architect George B. Post, who sent him to Chicago to assist architect Daniel H. Burnham in preparing a plan for the military academy at West Point. Burnham found Bennett's work highly satisfactory and in 1903 invited him to move to Chicago to collaborate on the comprehensive plan for San Francisco, and afterwards, the Plan of Chicago. The completed San Francisco plan was not implemented in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake, but Bennett became well known for his design work and co-authorship of the 1909 Plan of Chicago.Cohen, 2004, page 307 While Burnham raised money and visibility for the Chicago Plan, Bennett created the actual layouts and drawings which are so well known today. Bennett also trained with Chicago's then leading country house architect Howard Van Doren Shaw.Cohen, 2004, page 319 Bennett made Chicago his personal and professional headquarters for the rest of his career. He served on the Chicago Plan Commission in various capacities into the 1930s and developed a substantial private practice and a national reputation as a city planner. Burnham, who largely retired from active practice after 1905, other than for his work in Chicago, directed applicants to Bennett, who, with partners William E. Parsons (1872–1939) and Harry T. Frost (1886–1943), served as a planning consultant to many cities large and small. In the plan for Chicago, Burnham and Bennett created a working document giving substance to the City Beautiful philosophy. From this prototype Bennett developed comparable plans for numerous American cities, including Minneapolis, Detroit, and Portland, Oregon. Bennett's house in Lake Forest, Illinois Bennett married Catherine Jones from the prominent Lake Forest Jones family. They had one son, E. H. Bennett Jr., who was also an architect. In 1916 Bennett designed and built their estate, Bagatelle, on the northeast corner of the original Jones estate. The house still stands at the corner of Deerpath and Green Bay Roads in Lake Forest. Bagatelle is an interpretation of the Château de Bagatelle in Paris's Bois de Boulogne. Its classical garden with central fountain echos the design of Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain on Chicago's lakefront.Coventry, 2003, pp 209, 211, 227 He also owned Deerpath Farm, a dairy farm and country retreat on just west of Lake ForestCoventry, 2003, pp 388-89 which he gave to his son, and which now remains intact as the Deerpath Farm conservation community. For many years, Bennett's office was located in the penthouse of the Sante Fe building at 80 E. Jackson in Chicago. From this vantage point he could supervise the construction of Grant Park, which he designed as part of the Plan of Chicago, and its structures including Buckingham Fountain and the original Peristyle in today's Millennium Park. His son E. H. Bennett Jr. later occupied this same office through the late-1960s. Bennett's firm was a pioneer in the creation of zoning ordinances and the study of transportation and regional planning as urban design tools. He usually served on a consultant basis, frequently for quasi-public or commercial interests such as the Commercial Club of Chicago. His vision of the city was formed in the application of Beaux-Arts design principles of axiality and the incorporation of monumental public buildings as civic markers, coupled with a systematic ordering of functions for efficiency. Bennett's ideas about the marriage of technical and aesthetic ideals are important examples of urban utility and beauty in a democratic society. Bennett was concerned with both the regional organization of a city's services and the individual citizen's enjoyment of his city. He realized the importance of transportation planning, the placement of government and civic structures, zoning, and the creation of parks and public spaces for public enjoyment. After World War I, the nature of planning work changed. Fully three-quarters of the Bennett firm's work done in the 1920s was for official city planning agencies rather than for independent business or civic groups. With the Great Depression, Bennett's volume of work declined. From the late 1920s, he was involved in planning for the 1933 Chicago Century of Progress Exposition, and designed a number of structures for it. From 1927 until 1937, Bennett served as Chairman of the Board of Architects responsible for the development of the Federal Triangle in Washington, DC, a large complex of government buildings between the White House and the United States Capitol built to house a number of Federal agencies, including what is now the National Archives and Records Administration. Although most of his life's work reflected the Beaux Arts tradition, Bennett also designed two known modernist structures, one a personal studio on the south grounds of the Bagatelle estate, and the other a house in the artist colony of Tryon, North Carolina. After the retirement and death of his partners, Bennett closed his practice in 1944 and spent the final decade of his life in retirement. In the course of his career, Bennett had worked in nearly 20 states, from California to Florida, as well as in Puerto Rico and Canada. He presented his papers to The Art Institute of Chicago in 1953, and these were supplemented by additional gifts and bequests from his architect son, Edward H. Bennett, Jr., over the following two decades. The Edward H. Bennett Collection is currently held by the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago, and contains manuscript materials, daily diaries, photographs, drawings, newspaper clippings, and published city plans. In 2008 Edward Bennett's Grandson, Edward Bennett III donated a substantial collection of Bennett's personal papers, drawings and photographs including his personal notebooks for the Plans of Chicago and San Francisco to Lake Forest College. Images are available in Lake Forest College Library's digital collections.

He is a member of the Democratic Party and son of former West Virginia U.S. Senator Rush D. Holt Sr. He worked as a professor of public policy and physics, and during his tenure in Congress he was one of two physicists and the only Quaker there. Holt sought the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in the 2013 special primary election to fill the seat of U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, who died in office on June 3, 2013. He lost the nomination to Newark Mayor Cory Booker. Holt announced on February 18, 2014 that he would not seek re- election in 2014. In February 2015, Holt became chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and executive publisher of the Science family of journals. In July 2019, AAAS announced that Holt was taking immediate leave and would retire effective 1 September 2019.  Early life and education  Holt was born in Weston, West Virginia, to Rush Holt Sr. (1905–1955), who served as a United States Senator from West Virginia (1935–1941), and his wife, Helen Froelich Holt (1913–2015), the first woman to be appointed Secretary of State of West Virginia (1957–1959). Holt Sr. was the youngest person ever to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, at age 29. He died of cancer when Rush was six years old. Holt graduated from the Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1966, then later graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BS in physics from Carleton College in 1970, and later received his MS and PhD degrees in physics from New York University in 1981. The title of his doctoral dissertation was \\"Calcium absorption lines and solar activity: a systematic program of observations.\\"Holt's doctoral dissertation is available from University Microfilms International as document number 8127915  Academic career  Holt was a faculty member at Swarthmore College from 1980 to 1988 where he taught physics, public policy, and religion courses. During that time, he also worked as a Congressional Science Fellow for U.S. Representative Bob Edgar of Pennsylvania. From 1987 until 1989, Holt headed the Nuclear and Scientific Division of the Office of Strategic Forces at the U.S. Department of State. Holt was the Assistant Director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory at Princeton University, the University's largest research facility and the largest center for energy research in New Jersey.

Elections ;1996 Holt first ran for Congress in 1996 in New Jersey's 12th congressional district after incumbent Republican congressman Dick Zimmer decided to run for the U.S. Senate. On June 4, 1996, Holt lost the Democratic party primary, receiving 24% of the vote and finishing last of the three candidates. Lambertville Mayor David DelVecchio won the primary with 45% of the vote and Carl Mayer finished second with 31% of the vote. Holt received the most votes in Mercer County, while losing the other four counties in the district to DelVecchio and Mayer: DelVecchio won Monmouth, Hunterdon, and Somerset Counties while Mayer won Middlesex County. DelVecchio went on to lose the general election to Republican Michael Pappas. ;1998 Holt decided to run again in 1998. On June 2, 1998, Holt won the Democratic primary, defeating Carl Mayer 64% to 36%. Holt challenged one-term Congressman Michael Pappas. The incumbent's campaign experienced a setback after he read a poem, set to the tune of \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\", praising Kenneth Starr on the floor of the House of Representatives. Holt defeated Pappas by 4 percentage points, 51% to 47%, becoming the first Democrat to represent the district in two decades. Holt won Mercer (61%) and Middlesex (60%) while losing Monmouth (48%), Hunterdon (37%), and Somerset (40%).\\"Twinkle, twinkle Kenneth Starr: how physicist Rush Holt used the Clinton scandal to oust a Republican congressman\\", Campaigns & Elections, May 1999 ;2000 Holt was challenged by former Republican Congressman Dick Zimmer in the 2000 election. Holt's prior win was thought by Republicans to be a fluke, and the race attracted considerable money and advertising. The election was hotly contested and the winner was not known on election day. Zimmer was ahead on election night by just a few votes, but Holt was ahead the next day. Ten days after the election, Holt declared himself the winner by 481 votes. Zimmer challenged the results, but conceded after the count began to go against him.CNN.com — Zimmer concedes congressional race in N.J. after 22 days, November 29, 2000The Daily Princetonian — Page 3 , September 25, 2002 Holt ultimately won the election by a margin of 651 votes: 146,162 votes for Holt (48.730%) compared to Zimmer's 145,511 (48.513%), making it the only general election where Holt has not received a majority of the votes in the election. Holt won Mercer (61%) and Middlesex (56%) while losing Monmouth (48%), Hunterdon (35%), and Somerset (37%). ;2002 Redistricting after the 2000 census Holt's district became much safer politically, in part by adding much of Trenton while cutting out more conservative-leaning territory in Somerset and Hunterdon counties. While Holt faced a fairly well-funded challenge from Republican Secretary of State of New Jersey Buster Soaries, Holt easily won a third term, taking 61% to Soaries' 38%. He won all five counties: Mercer (68%), Middlesex (63%), Somerset (54%), Hunterdon (54%), and Monmouth (52%). ;2004 Holt won re-election to a fourth term, defeating Republican Bill Spadea 59% to 40%. He won four of five counties: Mercer (72%), Somerset (62%), Middlesex (59%), and Hunterdon (52%). He lost Monmouth (48%). ;2006 He won re-election to a fifth term, defeating former Helmetta, New Jersey Council President Joseph Sinagra, 66% to 34%. He won all five counties: Mercer (77%), Somerset (67%), Middlesex (65%), Hunterdon (61%), and Monmouth (56%). ;2008 He won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Holmdel, New Jersey Deputy Mayor Alan Bateman, 63% to 35%. He won all five counties: Mercer (77%), Somerset (66%), Middlesex (64%), Hunterdon (55%), and Monmouth (50%). ;2010 Holt raised $2,229,432 in the 2010 election cycle and spent $1,891,463. 72% came from individual donations, and 26% from PAC donations. Holt's former employer, Princeton University, was his single biggest donor, giving $56,863. Holt's opponent, Scott Sipprelle, raised $1,541,776 and spent $1,327,946. 65% of Sipprelle's funds came from self- financing. Independent Kenneth Cody refused to accept any donations.opensecrets.org, Campaign finance data on Rush Holt and Scott Sipprelle, retrieved 11/23/10. He won re-election to a seventh term, defeating Sipprelle, 53% to 46%. He won three of five counties: Mercer (70%), Somerset (60%), and Middlesex (52%). He lost Hunterdon (43%) and Monmouth (38%). ;2012 After redistricting in 2011, the 12th District became considerably more Democratic. All of the Republican-leaning portions of Hunterdon County and Monmouth County were taken out of the 12th district while the Democratic- leaning towns of Plainfield, Scotch Plains, Fanwood, Middlesex, Dunellen, Bound Brook, South Bound Brook, Manville, East Windsor Township, and Hightstown were added to the 12th district. Additionally, sections of Trenton, Franklin Township & Old Bridge Township which were formerly located in the 4th and 6th Congressional districts, respectively, were also added to the 12th district. Only four counties remained: Mercer, Somerset, Middlesex, and now Union. Holt won re-election to an 8th term, defeating Republican businessman Eric Beck 69% to 29%. He won all four counties Mercer (77%), Union (73%), Somerset (69%), and Middlesex (62%). On February 18, 2014, Rush Holt announced that he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 2014. Tenure Holt was also only the second research physicist to be elected to Congress, and the first physicist to be elected as a Democrat; he joined Vern Ehlers (R-MI) and was later joined by Bill Foster (D-IL). Foster is currently the only research physicist in the U.S. House of Representatives with the retirement of Ehlers, and Foster defeating Judy Biggert in 2012 to reenter the House. Holt's supporters produced green bumper stickers reading \\"My Congressman IS a rocket scientist!\\", reflecting his scientific background. Holt is one of two members of Congress to have participated on the American television game show Jeopardy!, the other being Senator John McCain of Arizona. Both appeared on the Fleming era of the television series with Holt winning five games. Holt's official Congressional website mentioned his being a five-time winner, as did some of his campaign materials. On February 28, 2011, Holt participated in a non-televised exhibition Jeopardy! match against the IBM computer Watson along with four other members of Congress (Jim Himes, Nan Hayworth, Jared Polis and Bill Cassidy). Holt bested the computer $8,600 to $6,200 in a single-round match. Holt at an event with a USDA official and youth of his district. As a Congressman, Holt maintained liberal viewpoints on several major issues, and consistently voted accordingly. For example, he supported abortion rights, opposed the privatization of Social Security, and supported a public health care option. Several of his legislative priorities included tax credits for small businesses, increasing access to a college education for middle-class families, maintaining Medicare and Social Security, and preserving the environment. In 2009, the National Journal rated him as one of the eight most liberal members of the House of Representatives.National Journal's Vote Rankings: The Top 10 - Hotline On Call . Hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com. Retrieved on 2010-07-12. Holt's rankings released by various interest groups reflect his liberal views. Since 2009, he has been rated 100 percent in accordance with the interests of the following interest groups, among others: American Public Health Association, Americans for Democratic America, and NARAL Pro-Choice America.votesmart.org , Data on interest group ratings, voting record, and issue positions, retrieved 11/23/10. Holt was a member of the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In the 113th Congress, he served as co-chair of the Energy Task Force in the New Democrat Coalition. He received a grade of 100% on the progressive Drum Major Institute's 2005 and 2007 Congressional Scorecards on middle-class issues, and he was consistently scored well by that organization. ;Environment As a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Holt supported legislation to clean up the environment and cap greenhouse gas emissions, and he promoted the development and use of alternative energy sources. He reintroduced the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act in 2011, co-sponsored the No New Drilling Act in 2012 to prevent new oil drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, co-sponsored the Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 21), founded the Children's Environmental Health Caucus to raise awareness about environmental issues pertaining to children's health, and secured funding to preserve open space and recreation areas. On September 21, 2012, Holt voted against the Stop the War on Coal Act of 2012 (H.R. 3409), a bill passed in the House (233 - 175). On July 30, 2010, he voted for the Offshore Drilling Regulations and Other Energy Law Amendments Bill (H.R. 3534), which passed in the House. On June 26, 2009, Holt voted for the Energy and Environmental Law Amendments (\\"Cap and Trade\\") Bill (H.R. 2454), which passed in the House by a narrow margin of 219 to 212. He also voted for the Renewable Energy Credits and Other Business and Individual Credits Bill (H.R. 7060) to extend energy efficiency tax credits, as well as various individual and business tax credits. Holt maintained a 100 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters since 1999, in addition to a 100 percent rating by Environment America in 2008, 2009, and 2011, and a 100 percent rating by Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund from 2003 to 2008. On November 12, 2012, the New Jersey Sierra Club awarded Holt the Outstanding Achievement Award for his environmental conservation efforts. A September 2012 Nature article featured Holt and his rare background as a research scientist: \\"[Holt] thinks what is equally important is having more scientific thinking, even among the non- scientists in government ... [Holt states], 'I'm more interested in the way that scientists are trained to deal with uncertainty, to deal with evidence and statistical reasoning, things that are lacking in the political debate.' When it comes to global warming, for instance, Representative Holt says we don't need people in Congress who understand atmospheric pressure, or glaciation. We simply need them to be open to the idea that evidence might disprove what they think they know. And that, he says, is thinking like a scientist.\\" Discussing science's role in policy and government, Holt points out a fallacy in the way people think about science: \\"The ethic in the profession is that you stick to your science, and if you're interested in how science affects public policy or public questions, just let the facts speak for themselves. Of course, there's a fallacy there, too. Facts are, by themselves, voiceless.\\" ;Education Holt is a strong supporter of educational initiatives, but questions the ways in which science is taught. \\"Our real problem is not that we're failing to produce excellent scientists, because we are [producing them], but rather that we have failed to maintain an appreciation for and understanding of science in the general population.\\" He is concerned that science education since 1958 may have created a population that is largely disconnected from scientific thinking. \\"We left behind about 80% of the population because we teach science in the schools primarily for future scientists.\\" Holt emphasizes the importance to all citizens of empirically-based thinking: While co-chair of the Research and Development Caucus, a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, and serving on the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, Holt worked on crafting several comprehensive education policies. He helped write the College Cost Reduction Act - the largest college aid expansion bill since the GI bill - which drastically reduced student loan interest rates and included Holt's provision to provide upfront tuition assistance for math, science, and foreign language teachers. He also helped establish the \\"American Opportunity\\" tax credit to alleviate the burden of college tuition for low- and moderate-income students. Furthermore, Holt helped enact the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act, which provides states with funding to reduce budget shortfalls and keep teachers in their classrooms. For his significant legislative work on and support for all education initiatives, but also for legislation to strengthen national security through expansion and improvement of foreign language study, and to increase foreign language capacity in the U.S. intelligence community and throughout the federal government by expanding education in critical need foreign languages, Holt received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in 2005. On May 28, 2010, Holt voted in support of the Science and Technology Funding Bill (H.R. 5116), a bill passed in the House that provided funding for science and technology research and development purposes. Formerly the Assistant Director at Princeton University's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Holt sought to promote involvement in programs of STEM fields. He successfully defended funding for the Department of Education's Mathematics and Science Partnerships programs. As a result of his efforts, he was repeatedly given an \\"A\\" rating by the National Education Association after 2007, along with a 100 percent approval rating by the National Association for College Admission Counseling in 2006 and 2009-2011. On January 22, 2013, Holt introduced a resolution designating February 12, 2013 (Charles Darwin's 204th birthday), as \\"Darwin Day\\" in order to recognize \\"the importance of sciences in the betterment of humanity\\". ;Social issues On his website, Holt stated, \\"Since coming to Congress, I have fought for fairness in health care coverage, worked to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, supported equal pay for equal work, and sought gender equity in schools.\\" While a Congressman, he strongly believed in women's right to make decisions about their health care, without interference by the government, and supported Roe v. Wade. Holt successfully opposed legislation that would have prevented access to birth control, eliminated funding for Title X (the national family planning program), and denied federal funding to Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood and the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association consistently issued an approval rating of 100 percent for Holt beginning in 1995, while the NARAL Pro-Choice America rated Holt 100 percent beginning in 1999. Holt also sponsored the Helping Seniors Choose their Medicare Drug Plan Act (H.R. 3152), which increased the access that low-income healthcare recipients have to prescription drugs under Medicare and Medicaid. With the Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act (H.R. 3835), Holt attempted to regulate the removal of voters' names from eligibility lists to ensure the validity of those lists. With the Judicious Use of Surveillance Tools in Counterterrorism Efforts (JUSTICE) Act of 2009 (H.R. 4005), Holt increased limits on governmental power with respect to counterterrorism efforts.

He lost the August 13, 2013, primary to Cory Booker. Booker was subsequently elected to the Senate in 2013, and re-elected in 2014. Post-Congressional career As Holt's final term in Congress was ending, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) announced that he would become its chief executive officer and executive publisher of the Science family of journals, succeeding Alan I. Leshner. Upon accepting the position, Holt praised the AAAS mission statement and said, \\"Fostering science and public engagement and advancing science in international affairs is what I've been doing for decades in one way or another.\\" He serves on the Advisory Board of the Journal of Science Policy & Governance. He retired from AAAS in September, 2019.

The course disseminated the ideas developed for the EDVAC (then being built at the Moore School as the successor computer to the ENIAC) and initiated an explosion of computer construction activity in the United States and internationally, especially in the United Kingdom. Background The Moore School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was at the center of developments in high-speed electronic computing in 1946. On February 14 of that year it had publicly unveiled the ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, developed in secret beginning in 1943 for the Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory. Prior even to the ENIAC's completion, work had begun on a second-generation electronic digital computer, the EDVAC, which incorporated the stored program model. Work at the Moore School attracted such luminaries as John von Neumann, who served as a consultant to the EDVAC project, and Stan Frankel and Nicholas Metropolis of the Manhattan Project, who arrived to run one of the first major programs written for the ENIAC, a mathematical simulation for the hydrogen bomb project. World War II had spawned major national efforts in many forms of scientific research—continued in peacetime—that required computationally intensive analysis; the thirst for information about the new Moore School computing machines had not been slaked, but instead intensified, by the distribution of von Neumann's notes on the EDVAC's logical design. Rather than allow themselves to be inundated with requests for demonstrations or slow progress in computer research by withholding the benefits of the Moore School's expertise until papers could be published formally, the administration, including Dean Harold Pender, Prof. Carl Chambers, and Director of Research Irven Travis, respectively proposed, organized, and secured funding for what they envisioned as a lecture series for between 30 and 40 participants enrolled by select invitation. The 8-week course was conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Army's Ordnance Department and the U.S. Navy's Office of Naval Research, who promised (by verbal authorizations) the $3,000 requested to cover lecturer salaries and fees and $4,000 for travel, printing, and overhead. ($1,569 over this figure was ultimately claimed.) Even as the Moore School found itself in the computing spotlight, its computer design team was disintegrating into splinter groups who hoped to advance computing research commercially, or academically at more prestigious institutions. In the former group were ENIAC co-inventors J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, who the previous March had departed the Moore School amidst a patent rights dispute to found the first computer company, the Electronic Control Company (later renamed to Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation), and took many on the Moore School staff with them; in the latter group were Herman Goldstine (the Army's liaison to the Moore School who served as administrative overseer of the ENIAC's construction) and Arthur Burks (a Moore School professor on the ENIAC design team), lured to the Institute for Advanced Study by von Neumann. Despite the somewhat acrimonious fracturing of the ENIAC/EDVAC group, these figures gave the majority of the Moore School Lectures, with Eckert and Mauchly receiving the highest salaries ($1,200 each), while Goldstine and the others received only travel expenses and an honorarium ($50 per lecture). Lecturers and lectures Lectures were given 5 days a week on weekdays and were from 1 to 3 hours long with afternoons typically reserved for informal seminars. Many of the pioneers of early computer development, especially those involved with [ENIAC] contributed to the Moore School Lectures, most prolifically Pres Eckert, followed by John Mauchly and Herman Goldstine. The topics covered virtually all facets of electronic computing relevant to the construction and operation of digital computers, and included, by popular demand, an unscheduled presentation of the ENIAC during the latter half of the sixth week and the first half of the seventh week, with lectures by Mauchly, Sharpless, and Chu. Discussions of the ENIAC were resisted since its logical design had been obsoleted even before its completion by ongoing work on the EDVAC with its stored-program concept; nevertheless, it was the only electronic digital computer then in operation and the students petitioned to see demonstrations and learn of its design.

The actual record of the lectures is incomplete. While many of the lectures were recorded on a wire recorder by Herman Lukoff and Dick Merwin, the recorder frequently broke down mid-lecture, and the recordings took several months to be transcribed and proofed by the lecturers. It wasn't until two years after the lectures, in 1948, that all of the material was assembled and published in four volumes edited by the Moore School's George W. Patterson, who was on the EDVAC staff. Some of the gaps have since been filled in with the notes of student Frank M. Verzuh.Verzuh, Frank M.

It was published by Penguin in 2006. Publication history It is the first book of the Hill's late writing period (post-epic). The first book of collected poems after Hill's spiritual epic, consisting of \\"Triumph of Love\\", \\"Speech, Speech!\\", and \\"The Orchards of Syon\\" - a tragedic triad which may include \\"Scenes from Comus\\" as either a comic or at least distanced work in a four-part movement - Hill considers the appetite itself of making poetry. Can poetry exist outside epic unity? Why is the poet still called to write after having given a total message? Can a poet offer a \\"total message\\"? Touching on the man-woman relationship, the act of creation, and the preconceptions, heights and failures of his career, Hill converses imaginatively with Cesare Pavese and responds with a discursive series of meditations varying the central theme of \\"turn and counterturn\\" that as one remain, however, \\"Without Title\\". One must not forget that Hill, an eminent etymologist, and whose taste for and fascination of the pun can be noticed since his early writings, may be drawing on several or all historical variants in the title itself. Thus, this work may purport to \\"have no category\\"; or that Hill himself - who has voiced much disappointment, publicly, in his lack of a reading public and at the time of its writing held no Nobel Prize nor knighthood from his native country that he refers to as \\"Mine, I say mine\\" (Canto 59, \\"SS!\\") - remains \\"Without Title\\". The epic and the epic's struggles now behind him, the writing is mature as it is easier: more open and relaxed, looser and quicker, Hill allows himself to pursue freely his poetic mines. It appears as the most \\"accessible\\" of Hill's works to those who are familiar with his opus and its problems. \\"Without Title\\" may be considered Hill's first \\"free\\" verse. This \\"ease\\" - which in Hill never sacrifices lexical and analogical precision (although here may be more forgiving of the structural character in meter and in overall composition) - may give way to a mature voice that confronts the freedom of working outside and beyond purposed, foreseen writing (of the epic) as well as the freedom from such pressures of having to confront, to speak with and to speak \\"God\\" (multiple references to this impossibility pervade the epic). In the \\"Orchards of Syon\\" Hill prematurely references this book of poetry when he notes that he will 'probably not' write any further afterwards. (quote?) This book, then, should be read as a refutation of this earlier preconception. Contemporaneous with or directly following, \\"Without Title\\" should be read opposite or beside his essays \\"Style and Faith\\" which attack a definition of writing verse after he has attempted his fullest utterance. Critical reception As with earlier work, Without Title was received as poetry that \\"makes few concessions\\",Michael Schmidt in The Independent, 17 February 2006 \\"complex at best... dauntingly impenetrable at worst,\\"Tim Martin in The Independent on Sunday, 5 February 2006 and as being \\"musically assured and resonant\\".

The following article is a supplement to the article Turing machine.  Turing machine as a mechanical device  right The Turing machine shown here consists of a special paper tape that can be erased as well as written with a \\"tally mark\\". Perhaps the TABLE is made out of a similar \\"read only\\" paper tape reader, or perhaps it reads punched cards. Turing's biographer Andrew Hodges (1983) has written that Turing as a child liked typewriters. A \\"'miraculous machine' -- a mechanical process which could work on Hilbert's decision problem\\" (Hodges p. 98) had been suggested by G. H. Hardy, one of Turing's teachers. Nevertheless, \\"His machine had no obvious model in anything that existed in 1936, except in general terms of the new electrical industries, with their teleprinters, television 'scanning', and automatic telephone exchange connections. It was his own invention.\\" (Hodges p. 109) Davis (2000) says that Turing built a binary multiplier out of electromechanical relays (p. 170). As noted in the history section of algorithm punched or printed paper tape and punched paper cards were commonplace in the 1930s. Boolos and Jeffrey (1974, 1999) note that \\"being in one state or another might be a matter of having one or another cog of a certain gear uppermost...\\" (p. 21).  Turing machine as a \\"poor mug\\" inside a box pulling the box along a rail  A poor mug in a box, reading, writing, erasing as per his list of instructions. After Boolos and Jeffrey figure 3-1, p. 21 :\\"We are not concerned with the mechanics or the electronics of the matter. Perhaps the simplest way to picture the thing is quite crudely: Inside the box there is a man, who does all the reading and writing and erasing and moving. (The box has no bottom: the poor mug just walks along between the ties, pulling the box with him.) The man has a list of m instructions written down on a piece of paper. He is in state qi when he is carrying out instruction number i [etc.]\\" (Boolos and Jeffrey (1974, 1999) p.21) This description closely follows Emil Post's \\"Formulation I\\" for a \\"finite combinatory process\\": a man, equipped with and following a \\"fixed unalterable set of instructions\\", moving left or right through \\"an infinite sequence of spaces or boxes\\" and while in a box either printing on a piece of paper a single \\"vertical stroke\\" or erasing it (Post 1936 reprinted in Undecidable p. 289). Post's formulation was the first of its type to be published; it preceded Turing's by a matter of a few months. Both descriptions—Post's, and Boolos and Jeffrey's — use simpler 4-tuples rather than 5-tuples to define the 'm-configurations' (instructions) of their processes.  A robot carries out the instructions  This is a robot with a console enlisted to work as a two-symbol three-state Busy Beaver. Robot is working on a tape initially printed with 0/blanks. Robot has looked at the symbol in the window (symbol 0), has read the instruction (\\"state\\") C and is about to PRINT a 1. Then it will push the tape-LEFT button. Lastly it will look toward instruction (\\"state\\") B. (The print/erase mechanism is out of sight, beneath the window. Maybe the tape is clear and the mechanism pulls off sticky 0's and sticks on 1's to PRINT and vice versa to ERASE.) This model was suggested by Stone (1972): :\\"Let us adopt the point of view that a computer is a robot that will perform any task that can be described as a sequence of instructions\\" (p. 3). Stone uses the robot to develop his notion of algorithm. This in turn leads him to his description of the Turing machine and his statement: :\\"The evidence seems to indicate that every algorithm for any computing device has an equivalent Turing machine algorithm ... if [Church's thesis] is true, it is certainly remarkable that Turing machines, with their extremely primitive operations, are capable of performing any computation that any other device can perform, regardless of how complex a device we choose.\\" (p. 13)  References  See the main article Turing machine for references.

It was established in 1920 as the College of Commerce when the University began offering a two-year commercial course. In 1931, the Bachelor of Science in Commerce degree was first conferred after a third year was added to the initial two-year program. In 1957, the College underwent its formal first survey by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU). Now known as the College of Business and Economics, it is home to two academic departments, which have been recognized by the Commission on Higher Education as Centers of Development, Business Management and Economics. In AY 2010-2011, the College of Business and Economics formally separated into two entities: The College of Business (COB) and the School of Economics (SOE). College of Business focuses on attracting students who aspire to become business professionals or professors of the faculty who would like to share their knowledge to help other aspiring students in their formation as business professionals. Students of COB may opt to specialize in any of the following fields: Accountancy Business Management or Applied Corporate Management Legal Management Management of Financial Institution Marketing Management Advertising Management The College also offers a double-degree (Liberal Arts-Commerce or LIA-COM) program in partnership with the College of Liberal Arts, that combines a Bachelor of Arts major with that of Accountancy or Commerce, major in any other business program. Its administrative offices are located at the St. La Salle Hall. It is currently the largest College of the University in terms of students. Many of its alumni have distinguished themselves, assuming top-level positions in the academe, business and industry, and government, such as Jose Diokno, Alberto Romulo, and Enrique Zobel.

Accessed August 15, 2006. The three pieces employ Gould's idiosyncratic technique of simultaneously playing the voices of two or more people, each of whom speaks a monologue to an unheard interviewer. Gould called this method \\"contrapuntal\\" radio. (The term contrapuntal normally applies to music in which independent melody lines play simultaneously; this type of music, exemplified by J. S. Bach, was the major part of Gould's repertoire.) The first and most well-known of the documentaries is The Idea of North, produced in 1967, in which five speakers provide contrasting views of Northern Canada. PBS aired an experimental film based on it, directed by Judith Pearlman, in 1970, its first co-production with CBC. To open the documentary, Gould says: > I've long been intrigued by that incredible tapestry of tundra and taiga > which constitutes the Arctic and sub-Arctic of our country.

In 1969, Gould made The Latecomers, about life in Newfoundland outports, and the province's program to encourage residents to urbanize. The third documentary, 1977's The Quiet in the Land, is a portrait of Russian Mennonites in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The speakers discuss the influence of contemporary society on traditional Mennonite values. The documentaries employ ambient sound and music. The rumbling of a train is heard frequently in The Idea of North, the ocean in The Latecomers, and a church sermon and choir in The Quiet in the Land. Again referring to music, Gould called these elements ostinatos. The Idea of North ends with the last movement of Karajan's recording of Sibelius' Symphony no. 5 in E flat major, the only use of a complete movement from the classical repertoire in the trilogy. Just like the Sibelius symphony ending The Idea of North, The Quiet in the Land can also be said to be in the key of E-flat major, as it uses and sometimes superimposes various pieces in that key: the sarabande from Bach's Cello Suite No. 4 in E-flat, a church hymn, a rehearsal of a choral piece for children's choir and harp (\\"As Dew in Aprille\\" from Britten's A Ceremony of Carols), and Janis Joplin's song \\"Mercedes Benz\\".

The Flyboys revolve around a \\"coming-of-age\\" story of two boys from a small town who find their courage tested when they accidentally stow away aboard an aircraft owned by the mob. This was the final film for actor Harrison Young, who died three years before the film was released. Plot Two kids from a small town, the new kid, Kyle Barrett (Reiley McClendon), finds himself saving one of his peers at school, Jason McIntyre (Jesse James), from a group of bullies and they quickly become friends. Although they come from different sides of the track, the two set out on an adventure. While playing hookey from school, the pair decide to go to the local airport, where Jason's uncle works, for some excitement. When they find aircraft are left unlocked, they sneak inside for a better look, trying out the controls first on a small light aircraft and then they check out a larger, twin-engined airliner. The mysterious and silver colored aircraft is in a hangar but suddenly, the hangar doors open and the boys immediately hide with the hope to not get in trouble, thinking that whoever it is will simply fetch or drop something off and then leave again. Slipping into the rear baggage compartment, Jason sneaks a peek at who is coming on board. He is frightened to discover one of the two men in the cockpit has a gun. Before they can make an escape, the aircraft starts up and takes off on a long flight over the Arizona desert. Jason and Kyle unexpectedly find a bomb in the baggage compartment but when they burst into the cabin to report their discovery, they find that everyone on board had bailed out. Taking the controls, Jason manages to straighten up the plane and tells Kyle to throw the explosive out, before he assumes the seat of the co-pilot and together they manage to land the aircraft themselves- But their troubles are only beginning. Jason and Kyle soon realize that they are embroiled in a criminal effort to steal millions of dollars from the mob. In the process of staying one step ahead of gangsters, they find their courage to come out on top.

Production Producer, director and screenwriter Rocco DeVilliers worked with a $2.4 million dollar budget, meagre for a major production. Including pre-production, work on the film took over seven years. Once production was complete, the film was shopped around to major studios and distributors but was not successful in making any headway. Ultimately, despite 21 wins at numerous film festivals, The Flyboys was relegated to a DVD release, re-titled as Sky Kids. Promotional efforts then centered on the new title. The film was broadcast on Sky Movies UK on August 15, 2009. It was released on DVD in the UK titled Sky Kids on May 25, 2009. The Flyboys was filmed in parts of Southwestern Utah, mainly in Hurricane, Utah, St. George, Utah, Washington, Utah and Zion National Park. Principal photography took place at Mesquite Airport,in Clark County, Nevada, United States.

Diagnostic programs ideally provide the user with guidance regarding any issues or problems found during its operation. Diagnostics programs may be simple or complex, operating unknowingly within everyday devices or awaiting their invocation to make more complex performance assessments. Everyday examples are a microwave oven that displays code F6 to warn of a shorted temperature probe or a garage door opener that flashes its control board's LED four times warning of critically misaligned safety sensors and impending shutdown. Diagnostic programs are also inserted into consumer electronic products and electronic games. Sometimes if the owner of an electronic device asks the manufacturer how to access the hidden diagnostic program, they may reply to the consumer saying that the information is considered to be \\"proprietary\\" and cannot be shared. History Early diagnostics programs were procedural instructions performed by humans, not by computer programs. See Built-in test equipment that enabled system operators to perform testing and diagnostics. As computers became smaller, more mobile, computer programs were used to perform diagnostics tasks. In the late 1960s, Volkswagen introduced the first on-board computer system with diagnostics provisions. Methods of operation The diagnostics program for a device or system may be independently located or integrated within. These Methods of Operation are arranged, more-or-less, in order of increasing complexity and their increasing value of diagnostics information. # Background monitoring of system indicators, for statistical analysis of trends, and for recording abnormal events. # Solution-based diagnostics, that test for known failure modes by identifying if their known symptoms are detected. # Black box, which is testing of a mechanism without knowing how it works, and merely focusing on the accuracy of output data based on a known input. # White box, which uses knowledge of a mechanism's inner functions for direct testing. # Operation- oriented, a combination of both black and white box, with one or more black- box operations interleaved with one or more white-box operations. This mode of testing is not preferred, however, some complex systems do not have the necessary interfaces to perform one or the other type independently. # Integrated background diagnostics, that perform testing of system components during idle-time of a system. # Operation-interleaved diagnostics, that incorporate diagnostics into the normal operation of a system component, thus any marginal operating mode is immediately diagnosed. Examples of hardware components with features that assist a diagnostic program are: ## Modern hard drives have Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) commands that provide information about internal error conditions, e.g., spin retry counts, bad sector counts, etc. ## Some systems may use Error Correcting Code (ECC) memory that logs memory failure events that were automatically corrected. Architectures * Single-purpose diagnostic, also referred to as \\"Defined-purpose\\" diagnostic, such as a program that validates the Windows DirectX configuration. * Multi-purpose diagnostic, a monolithic program that performs multiple tasks that may or may not be suitable for all uses. This would be similar to a hammer that will perform well with nails, less so with screws, and poorly with nuts and bolts. * Modular diagnostic, which combines sets of single-purpose diagnostics, Lego-like, into an environment easily tailored to particular industry requirements. Key to its design is its reusable hardware and software operating system that performs all of its diagnostics programs. Application examples are: ** manufacturing testing with an emphasis on checking assembly-related issues and optimizing for time ** end-user targeted diagnostics, with an easy to comprehend non-technical presentation, and an emphasis on solutions ** service/warranty testing, focusing on identifying a failed or marginal field-replaceable unit (FRU) ** refurbishing centric, which attempts to determine if a system can be resold or reused, with an emphasis on depth of testing, at a cost to time spent testing * Knowledge-Driven diagnostic system (such as a technician or diagnostician) where the knowledge acquired over time is used as a \\"mental model\\" of the system's operation and informs the diagnostic system through logical reasoning to one or more possible or likely causes for a situation to exist. Example diagnostics program applications * A BIOS embedded or UEFI embedded Power-on self-test (POST) program that performs a basic check of the system's hardware components before commencing normal operation * A BIOS embedded or UEFI embedded hardware diagnostic program in OEM PCs * Diagnostics that are run on- demand when a user needs assistance, typically within the primary operating system of the computer (e.g.Windows) * \\"Off-line diagnostics\\" that are run outside the primary operating system, typically to reduce the masking influence of software on hardware issues * Household refrigerators that display diagnostics of their internal temperature, ice machine functionality, etc. * The 1996 Onboard Diagnostics II system (OBD II) that standardized the diagnostics port across all models of cars and light trucks allowing vehicle owners and repair technicians access to the vehicle's error code and emissions history. * Personal computer users have diagnostics options from both software and hardware sources, e.g., Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) diagnostics guide for confirming hardware failures. * Industrial production test equipment that diagnoses electronic devices or systems. *When an electronic device such as a Bop It says its version number such as \\"one point three six\\" and starts playing through a set of sounds one after the other.

Under Telnack's oversight, New Edge was implemented by other Ford designers, including Claude Lobo and Australian John Doughty. New Edge distinctively combined intersecting arcs and other features, creating \\"surface tension by adding creases to soft aerodynamic shapes.\\" Describing the 2000 Ford Focus's implementation of the styling theme, New York Times writer Michelle Krebs said the Focus \\"features crisp lines and taut surfaces. The Focus will not be mistaken for anything else on the road. I found more people liked its look than hated it, and few were indifferent.\\" Reputedly, New Edge design saved production time, the edges themselves ostensibly making the panels much easier to align. After the international Ford Focus had won the prestigious European Car of the Year (1999), William Diem of the New York Times wrote, \\"To some extent, the prize vindicates Ford's risky design for the Focus, especially the New Edge styling -- a combination of straight lines, curves and planes.\\" The styling theme began to be replaced by Kinetic Design in 2006 with the Ford S-Max and Ford Galaxy. Vehicles with New Edge design Europe Ford Focus featured New Edge. The concept Ford GT90 in 1995 was the first car to feature New Edge styling. The following year, the Ford Ka became the first production vehicle using the styling, followed by the revised Mondeo in 1996, the Puma in 1997, the Focus in 1998, and the Cougar. The Ford Fiesta received a facelift incorporating a New Edge front end in 1999. Although Ford did not release any further New Edge designs, notable New Edge features continued on Ford of Europe models; namely the trapezoidal grille and large, extended wheel arches. New Edge Mustang 1999-2004 Ford Mustang North America In North America, New Edge was employed for the Ford Mustang's 1999 facelift of the fourth generation pony car (1994–2004). New Edge elements were also used on their other more conventional vehicles, like the Ford Taurus, Ford Windstar, and Ford Explorer, which were all redesigned at the turn of the century. European designed New Edge models that were sold in North America comprised the Ford Focus and eighth-generation Mercury Cougar sold as the Ford Cougar in Europe. Australia AU Falcon incorporated New Edge design Ford Australia employed New Edge with the Falcon for its \\"AU\\" model, which was first released in 1998. Ford chose a bold direction for the Falcon's design. The experiment did not prove successful, as the Australian public largely rejected the design. It consisted of drooping headlamps and taillights, with sharp angles employed incongruously to rounded surfaces. The wheel wells bulged to the point where any size of wheel appeared too small for the car. The flagship models, the XR8 and Ford Fairmont looked better, and the AUII update improved the stance of the range. Ford gave the Falcon an extensive exterior upgrade, as well as mechanical upgrade in 2002. The upgrade has since been lauded by the press and performed well in the market. The 2002 exterior refresh served as the basis of the Falcon's design from then through to 2012, and probably beyond.

Naturally-occurring satellite viruses are also helper virus dependent, and can sometimes be modified to become viral vectors. Viral vector Since the genome of the gutless virus does not include genes encoding the enzymes and/or structural proteins required to replicate, it is deemed safe for use in gene therapy since an infection cannot occur except in the presence of a suitable helper virus. Well established protocols allow scientists to propagate helper dependent viruses in the lab. However, using an actual helper virus poses problems when it comes to purification of a desired transgenic virus. Therefore, lab methods often utilize minimal fragments of the helper DNA that can serve this purpose without creating unwanted virus. This process usually involves the introduction of three separate DNA plasmids into a eukaryotic cell line through a process called transfection. These plasmids contain either transgenic DNA or replication and capsid encoding DNA, plus helper DNA. Every cell that is successfully transfected with all three DNA fragments will produce the necessary proteins to produce infective viruses. These viruses will only have transgenic DNA encapsidated and therefore once they've infected a patient's cell, they will not be capable of reproducing.  Satellite virus Helper dependent viruses can also occur in nature without being \\"gutted\\". The term satellite virus has been given to a large group of viruses that all require the presence of another virus to replicate. Many of these are plant viruses, but animal viruses can be seen in the case of dependoviruses. Within the family parvoviridae, the dependovirus genus was given a distinct classification due to their dependence on another virus. The most widely known dependovirus is adeno-associated virus (AAV) which was originally discovered as a contaminant in a sample of simian adenovirus. Though AAV is considered to be dependent on adenovirus, it is able to replicate in the presence of herpesvirus as well as certain cytotoxic events such as UV irradiation or some carcinogens During the course of a natural dependovirus infection, if the helper virus is not present, the dependovirus is often capable of integrating into the host genome and going into a latent phase of its life cycle—effectively waiting for the next helper virus infection. For gene therapy uses, the vector is stripped of its ability to integrate. Because AAV can deliver transgenic material in a non-replicating form, it is a strong candidate for gene therapy and is currently used in about 8% of clinical trials. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is an example of a replication defective, helper dependent ssRNA virus because it requires Hepatitis B virus (HBV) to provide HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) for the encapsidation of its genome. The envelope proteins on the outer surface of HDV are entirely provided by HBV.

The exact date of origin of the legend is unknown, but it has literary antecedents from the 5th century AD, and the \\"rotten axe handle\\" plot element was certainly present by an early 6th-century version. One plot element of the legend features two immortals playing a board game, interpreted in later times as Go, so that Lanke (or Ranka in Japanese) has become a literary name for Go. The legend The legend is recorded in 's or Tales of the Strange, and features a woodcutter, Wang Zhi or Wang Chih (王質, Wáng Zhì), and his encounter with the two immortals in the mountains. The story runs as follows:Ren Fang (任昉), Shu Yi Ji (《述異記》: \\"At Mount Shishi in Xing'an County, during the Jin Dynasty, a Wang Zhi was chopping wood, when he saw several youths, playing a board game and singing. Zhi stopped to listen. The youths gave an item to Zhi, which was similar to a date core. Zhi held it in his mouth and felt no hunger. A moment later, the youths said: \\"Why are you not going?\\" Zhi rose, and saw that the axe handle had completely rotted. When he returned, he saw no-one from his own time.\\" (「信安郡石室山，晉時王質伐木，至見童子數人，棋而歌，質因聽之。童子以一物與質，如棗核，質含之不覺饑。俄頃，童子謂曰：『何不去？』，質起，視斧柯爛盡，既歸，無復時人。」) Wang Zhi was a hardy young fellow who used to venture deep into the mountains to find suitable wood for his axe. One day he went farther than usual and became lost. He wandered about for a while and eventually came upon two strange old men who were playing Go, their board resting on a rock between them. Wang Chih was fascinated. He put down his axe and began to watch. One of the players gave him something like a date to chew on, so that he felt neither hunger nor thirst. As he continued to watch he fell into a trance for what seemed like an hour or two. When he awoke, however, the two old men were no longer there. He found that his axe handle had rotted to dust and he had grown a long beard. When he returned to his native village he discovered that his family had disappeared and that no one even remembered his name. Lanke Mountain Lanke Mountain, also known as Shishi (\\"Stone Room\\") Mountain or Shiqiao (\\"Stone Bridge\\") Mountain is a hill located 10 km southeast of Quzhou city centre in Zhejiang, beside Wuxi River. The hilltop is 164 metres above sea level. The top of the hill features a rock formation in the form of a bridge. A cave is located under the bridge, which is said to be the location of the legend concerning Wang Zhi. In religious Taoism, Lanke Mountain, as the abode of immortals, is identified as one of the 72 \\"blessed places\\". Literary evolution The early 4th-century compilation of legends and occult tales Yiyuan (異苑) by official Liu Jingshu (劉敬叔) recorded a tale about a traveller riding a horse, who saw two elderly men by the side of the road playing shupu (樗蒲), a race game, and got off his horse to watch. In the middle of the game he glanced at his horse and was astonished to see that it had turned to a skeleton. When he returned home, he found that all of his family were gone.Liu Jingshu (刘敬叔), Yiyuan (《异苑》)：\\"In the olden days, a man rode a horse into a mountain. Two elderly men were by the side of the road playing shupu. He got off the course, and leaned his whip on the ground and watched. He thought only a moment had passed, but when he looked at his horse whip, it had completely rotted; he then looked at his horse, and it was a skeleton. When he got home, none of his family was alive. He died from the grief. (“昔有人乘马山行，遥岫里有二老翁，相对樗蒲。遂下马，以策拄地而观之。自谓俄顷，视其马鞭，漼然已烂，顾瞻其马，鞍骸骨朽，既而至家，无复亲属，一恸而绝。”) The 4th-century Dongyang Ji (東陽記) by Zheng Qizhi recorded a slightly different version: a man named Wang Zhi went to Mount Shishi, in Zhejiang, to chop wood, and stopped when he heard four youths singing. The youths gave him food that looked like date cores. He ate them, and was not hungry. By the time the youths finished singing, and he started on his way home, he noticed that his axe handle had rotted. When he returned home, he realised that decades had past. The Dongyang Ji version was quoted by Li Daoyuan's influential 6th- century work Commentary on the Water Classic, which made the story famous.Commentary on the Water Classic(《水经注》), quoting Dongyang Ji: \\"In Xing'an County there is a Xuanshi (\\"Hanging Room\\") Hill. In mid-Jin dynasty, a commoner Wang Zhi was chopping wood when he came upon the stone room. He saw four youths playing a stringed instrument and singing. Zhi stayed, listening while leaning on the handle of his axe. The youths gave him an item, similar to a date core. Zhi held it in his mouth and was no longer hungry. A moment later, the youths said, \\"we are leaving\\", and left. The axe handle had completely rotted. When he returned, Zhi found that he had been gone for several decades, and all his family had died. (「信安縣有懸室坂，晉中朝時，有民王質，伐木至石室中，見童子四人彈琴而歌，質因留，倚柯聽之。童子以一物如棗核與質，質含之便不復饑。俄頃，童子曰：其歸。承聲而去，斧柯漼然爛盡。既歸，質去家已數十年，親情凋落。」) Still later, 6th-century author 's or Tales of the Strange so that the youths were playing a board game and singing, although he did not specifically mention Go. The later versions of the story that identify two elders playing Go may also be influenced by the motif of immortals playing Go in other stories, such as the tale that appeared in Gan Bao's 4th-century compilation of supernatural stories In Search of the Supernatural, in which the gods Bei Dou (the Big Dipper) and Nan Dou (the corresponding stars in Sagittarius) were playing Go, when the youth Yan Chao approached them to ask for a longer life.

She is widely known for her works in literary fiction and her descriptive characterization. Born and raised in Portland, Maine, her experiences in her youth served as inspiration for her novels–the fictional \\"Shirley Falls, Maine\\" is the setting of four of her seven novels. Strout's first novel, Amy and Isabelle (1998) met with widespread critical acclaim, became a national bestseller, and was adapted into a movie starring Elisabeth Shue. Her second novel, Abide with Me (2006), received critical acclaim but ultimately failed to be recognized to the extent of her debut novel. Two years later, Strout wrote and published Olive Kitteridge (2008), to critical and commercial success grossing nearly $25 million with over one million copies sold as of May 2017. The novel won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The book was adapted into a multi Emmy Award-winning mini series and became a New York Times bestseller. Five years later, she published The Burgess Boys (2013), which became a national bestseller. My Name Is Lucy Barton (2016) was met with international acclaim and topped the New York Times bestseller list. Lucy Barton later became the main character in Strout's 2017 novel, Anything is Possible. A sequel to Olive Kitteridge, titled Olive, Again, was published in 2019. Early life and education Strout was born in Portland, Maine, and was raised in small towns in Maine and Durham, New Hampshire. Her father was a science professor, and her mother was an English professor and also taught writing in a nearby high school.Birnbaum, Robert (2008-08-26), \\"Elizabeth Strout\\", The Morning News. After graduating from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, she spent a year in Oxford, England, followed by studies at law school for another year. In 1982, she graduated with honors, and received a law degree from the Syracuse University College of Law. That year her first story was published in New Letters magazine.  Career   Early career  Strout moved to New York City, where she waitressed and began developing early novels and stories to little success. She continued to write stories that were published in literary magazines, as well as in Redbook and Seventeen. She enrolled in Law School at Syracuse University College of Law, and practiced law for six months before concluding her legal practice and focusing on her writing. In an interview with Terry Gross in January 2015 she said of the experience, \\"law school was more of an operation, I think.\\" She stated in a 2016 interview with The Morning News, > I wanted to be a writer so much that the idea of failing at it was almost > unbearable to me. I really didn’t tell people as I grew older that I wanted > to be a writer—you know, because they look at you with such looks of pity. I > just couldn’t stand that.  Rise to prominence with Amy and Isabelle  She worked for six or seven years to complete her book Amy and Isabelle, which when published was shortlisted for the 2000 Orange Prize and nominated for the 2000 PEN/Faulkner Award for fiction. Amy and Isabelle was adapted as a television movie, starring Elisabeth Shue and produced by Oprah Winfrey's studio, Harpo Films. Strout was a National Endowment for the Humanities lecturer at Colgate University during the fall semester of 2007, where she taught creative writing at both the introductory and advanced levels. She was also on the faculty of the master of fine arts (MFA) program at Queens University of Charlotte in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Olive Kitteridge and its Pulitzer Prize  Rome, Italy Abide with Me was published in 2006 by Random House to further critical acclaim. Ron Charles of The Washington Post summarized her book by saying: \\"as she did in her bestselling debut, Amy and Isabelle, Strout sets her second novel in a small New England town, whose natural beauty she returns to again and again as this tale unfolds against the background of the Cold War tensions of the 1950s.\\" The New Yorker welcomed the novel with a positive review: \\"with superlative skill, Strout challenges us to examine what makes a good story—and what makes a good life.\\" GoodReads rated the novel 3.75 stars out of 5.

It was also a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award the same year. The book enjoyed widespread commercial success and Louisa Thomas, writing in The New York Times, said: > The pleasure in reading Olive Kitteridge comes from an intense > identification with complicated, not always admirable, characters.

The Burgess Boys and recent work  The Burgess Boys was published March 26, 2013, to further critical acclaim. A New York Times review noted that she \\"handles her storytelling with grace, intelligence and low-key humor, demonstrating a great ear for the many registers in which people speak to their loved ones,\\" but criticized her for not developing certain characters. NPR noted the novel by saying: \\"This is an ambitious novel that wants to train its gaze on the flotsam and jetsam of thought, as well as on big-issue topics like the politics of immigration and the possibility of second chances.\\" The book became her second New York Times bestseller. The Washington Post reviewed it with the following: \\"[T]he broad social and political range of The Burgess Boys shows just how impressively this extraordinary writer continues to develop.\\" After a three-year break, she published My Name Is Lucy Barton (2016), a story about Lucy Barton, a recovering patient from an operation who reconnects with her estranged mother. The New York Times reviewed it with the following: \\"there is not a scintilla of sentimentality in this exquisite novel. Instead, in its careful words and vibrating silences, My Name Is Lucy Barton offers us a rare wealth of emotion, from darkest suffering to—‘I was so happy. Oh, I was happy’—simple joy.\\" The novel would go on to top the New York Times bestselling list. It was also long listed for the Man Booker Prize. She broke from her usual multi-year break in between novels to publish Anything is Possible (2017)–her sixth novel. Anything is Possible was called a \\"literary mean joke\\" due to its \\"hurting men and women, desperate for liberation from their wounds\\" in contrast to its title. The novel had her noted as \\"a master of the story cycle\\" by Heller McCalpin of NPR. It was largely seen as an advance on her previous book due to its \\"ability to render quiet portraits of the indignities and disappointments of normal life, and the moments of grace and kindness we are gifted in response\\" according to Susan Scarf Merrell of The Washington Post. Anything is Possible won The Story Prize for books published in 2017. A sequel to Olive Kitteridge, titled Olive, Again, was published in October 2019. Personal life Strout is married to former Maine Attorney General James Tierney, lecturer in law at Harvard Law School\\"James E. Tierney\\", Harvard Law School. and founding director of State AG, an educational resource on the office of state attorney general.StateAG.org.

Use It commonly arises in cases of divorce financial proceedings often in the guise of other names and general principles used. Hotchpot remains of occasional use in a dwindling range of jurisdictions worldwide to divide up a deceased person's estate subsequent to gift(s) which the local law considers: *\\"advanced\\" under general applicable intestacy rules or family/other trusts by the donor (also known as a settlor where an express trust has been made or as an intestate where he has deceased and had no valid Will); or *adeemed by satisfaction which is the term used when specifically referring to a valid Will made by the deceased (testator/testatrix) -- ademption. By jurisdiction Scotland The principle exists in the law of Scotland in cases of succession and is known as collatio inter liberos. South Africa Hotchpot exists in South Africa also with respect to succession under the name \\"collation\\".  Canada  In Canada the presumption of advancement is applied such that in most Canadian provinces, the receipt of property or land that would otherwise be disposed by will, by a beneficiary in advance, of that will, may be part or all of their entitlement under the will. Most provinces explicitly do not require the return of the advancement, and provide for its valuation as of the time of receipt not death. As with the original \\"pain of being excluded from the distribution\\", a refusal to provide such valuation could be a rationale for exclusion from receiving new property. For instance, in Nova Scotia, \\"if a child or grandchild of a person who has died wholly intestate has been advanced by the intestate by portion, the portion shall be reckoned... as part of the estate of the intestate distributable according to law\\" and valued as of the time of receipt not death.\\"http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/laws/stat/rsns-1989-c-236/latest/rsns-1989-c-236.html United States =Estate Law= Certain state laws refer to hotchpot in describing the laws of intestate succession (i.e. succession without a will). See, for example, Virginia Code § 64.2-206. Advancements brought into hotchpot. =Internal Revenue Code= Hotchpot is slang for the blended group of Section 1231 \\"Gains and Losses\\" of the U.S. tax code. According to the code, a section 1231 gain is: # Any recognized gain on the sale or exchange of property used in the trade or business, and # Any recognized gain from compulsory/involuntary conversion of ## Property used in the trade or business, or ## Any capital asset which is held for more than one year and is held in connection with a trade or business or a transaction entered into for profit # Into other property or money # Because of ## Total or partial destruction ## Theft or seizure ## An exercise of the power of requisition or condemnation ## Threat or imminence of such exercise A section 1231 loss is any loss that occurs under the same circumstances required for a section 1231 gain. Under this definition, the term “property used in the trade or business” is subject to the limitations of Section 1231(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, A capital asset is property held by the taxpayer, whether or not that property is connected with his trade or business, but not that which falls into the eight categories set forth in Section 1221(a). Those eight sections are: # Property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers, or stock or inventory # Property used in a trade or business which is subject to depreciation in section 167, or real property used in trade or business # A copyright, composition, letter/memo, or something similar, held by the person who made the property, or, in the case of letter/memo, for whom the property was prepared/produced, or the person who determines the basis of such property # Accounts or notes receivable acquired in the normal course of trade or business for services rendered or sale of property to customers from stock/inventory # A publication of the U.S. Government which is received by the Government or one of its agencies, unless it is purchased at a public sale price and is held by the taxpayer who received it or the taxpayer who determines its basis # Any commodities derivative financial instrument held by such a dealer, unless the Secretary of the Treasury is satisfied that the instrument has no connection to the holder’s activities as a dealer and the instrument is clearly identified in the dealer’s records as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into # Any hedging transaction clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into # Supplies of the type regularly used/consumed by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of trade/business Hotchpot gains and losses are given preferential status by Section 1231 of the code, a taxpayer-friendly policy that dates back to the World War II era.Donaldson, Samuel A. Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 2007 (2nd edition), p. 519. This preferential status allows hotchpot gains and losses to be treated as long-term capital gains and losses when the gains are greater than the losses (thereby treating the net gain at a more favorable tax rate), and allows them to be treated as ordinary income and ordinary losses when the gains are less than or equal to the losses (thereby allowing the losses to cancel out the income) (Id. at 522.) Under the code, long-term capital gains are gains from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year, if and to the extent that such gain is considered when computing gross income. Long-term capital losses are those from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year, if and to the extent that such losses are considered in computing taxable income. While the average taxpayer may have no need to identify \\"1231 gains and losses\\" as \\"Hotchpot gains and losses,\\" that taxpayer likely benefits from the preferential tax treatment. In addition, section 1231(a)(4)(C) contains a special rule for the purposes of determining whether a § 1231 gain or § 1231 loss enters the hotchpot.Donaldson, Samual A. Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 2007 (2nd edition), p. 521. This subsection states that if recognized losses from an involuntary conversion as a result of casualty or from theft, of any property used in the trade or business or of any capital asset held for more than one year, exceed the recognized gains from an involuntary conversion of any such property as a result of casualty or from theft, such losses and gains do not enter the hotchpot.26 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(4)(C) Thus, section 1231 does not apply to gains and losses resulting from casualties and thefts if the losses exceed the gains. The practical effect of this subsection is that net losses from such involuntary conversions will be treated as ordinary incomeReg. § 1.1231-1(e)(3) (abolished by s1(2) Law Reform (Succession) Act 1995 in intestacy cases from 1 January 1996). England and Wales In English law, Hotch-pot or hotch-potch was the name given to a rule of equity whereby a person, interested along with others in a common fund, and having already received something from the same interest, is required to offset what has been so acquired when his share of the common fund is considered, on pain of being excluded from the common fund distribution. The principle equated to collatio bonorum under Roman law: emancipated children, to share any final inheritance afforded by their freed forebear shared equally with unemancipated siblings, were required to bring their inherited property from that person into the equation. In England and Wales hotchpot was abolished for persons dying intestate from and including the first day of 1996, by section 1(2) of the Law Reform (Succession) Act 1995.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/41/section/1 The word would likely be shunned in the updated language divorce proceedings, which typically apply similar principles to recent large inter-marital gifts (i.e. between husband and wife). The word hodge-podge colloquially is not slang but rather a synonym for a jumble or mishmash.

Enjoy watching videos easily with Mobile GOM Player any time, anywhere.  Popularity in South Korea  GOM Player is South Korea's most popular media player. As of July 2007, it had 21.3 million users, compared to 5.4 million users of Microsoft's Windows Media Player. A survey of usage over a single week by Metrix, an internet survey company, found that 69.8% of users watched pornography, 43.2% watched cinematic movies, 29.6% watched television dramas, 21.8% watched variety shows, 11% watched cartoons, and 7% watched music videos. This is in line with South Korea being allegedly the greatest spender per capita on pornography, even though local production of pornography is illegal. Gretech disputes the credibility of this report. Metrix obtained the survey data from 12,000 internet users who agreed to voluntarily install a monitoring tool. Only file names were used to categorize the media files included in the survey. Gretech points out that media files played by GOM Player are not monitored, and that only the explicit installation of the Metrix survey software enabled that monitoring to be done. Easter Eggs a secret easter egg can be accessed by right clicking a video that's playing in GOM Player, after right clicking, the user needs to click \\"About\\", in the about tab, double-click, a window will open called \\"dodge\\".  Third-party malware controversy  Since January 2019, it is known to install third-party malware. Users also reported the issue a year before in January 2018.

Opened on 29 December 1986, it was the original northern terminus of the system and remains the terminus of the route №1. The station was built as a multi-platform complex, located on a tram reversal ring, with only one of the three platforms being housed in a formal structure, whilst the rest are typical tram stops. This is due to the station being located next to the system's depot, which results in the unusual appearance of the station. Trams coming into the station first drop off the passengers on a standard platform, before picking up new passengers on the covered structure and continuing southbound. For the trams going into the depot, there is a third platform located slightly north of the station. Ironically it is the only way that passengers coming from route №2 can get off at this station. The structure of the second platform consists of a concrete semi-structure with a rotunda vestibule and a granite covered platform with white tiles on the wall. In addition there are a series of portals that have a semicircular ledge with a wooden bench on the perimeter. The exterior of the station, along with the ledges, are faced with dark-cherry coloured tiles that appear as bricks. When in 1999 the system was extended there were discussions on closing the station, or moving it onto the main line, however this plan was abandoned in favour of keeping it as it is, mostly out of the lack of finances to carry out a complex reconstruction, but also out of the passenger flow; the station does get a large number of people because, unlike the nearby new Industrialna, it is located right in the middle of the Hirnytske microraion and is right next to the KVRZ plant. In 2004, the station also saw the finale of the Ukrainization campaign, the Russian sign on the vestibule was replaced by the Ukrainian one.
