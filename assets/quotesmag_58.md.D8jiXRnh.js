It is used to explain variations in the effects in the consequences of behavior. Most importantly, a MO affects how strongly the person is reinforced or punished by the consequences of their behavior. For example, food deprivation is a motivating operation; if a person is hungry, food is strongly reinforcing, but if a person is satiated, food is less reinforcing. Laraway, S., Snycerski, S., Michael, J., & Poling. (2003). Motivating operations and terms to describe them: some further refinements. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis. 36. 407-414. In 2003 Laraway suggested subdividing MOs into those that increase the reinforcing or punishing effects of a stimulus, which are termed establishing operations, and MOs that decrease the reinforcing or punishing effects of a stimulus, which are termed abolishing operations. Theory The concept of motivating operation deals with the observation that behavior depends not only on the stimuli present in the current situation and the organism's past experience with those stimuli, but also on the organism's recent past history of deprivation, satiation, pain, or other such influences. Such a past history can have two effects: it can change the value of a consequence by making it more or less reinforcing, and/or it can change the probability of behaviors that have produced that consequence. For example, food deprivation changes the value of food, making it more reinforcing, and it also evokes learned behaviors that have obtained food. Likewise, food satiation reduces both the reinforcing effect of food and the probability of food-getting behaviors. Note that a motivating operation differs from a discriminative stimulus (Sd). A discriminative stimulus signals the availability of reinforcement, while a motivating operation changes the effectiveness of a reinforcer.Michael, J. (1982) Distinguishing between discriminative and motivational functions of stimuli. Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior. 37. 149-155. Nine main unconditioned (i.e. not learned) motivating operations, have been identified in humans. Deprivation of food, water, sleep, activity, or oxygen; becoming too warm or too cold; and increase of a painful stimulus all function as establishing operations for related behaviors, and increase the effect of positive or negative reinforcement related to them. Conversely, being satiated with food, water, sleep, activity, oxygen and sex; getting cooler after being too warm or warmer after too cold; and decrease of a painful stimulus all function as abolishing operations for related behavior and reinforcement. There are also conditioned motivating operations that result from the learning history of the organism. Three kinds of conditioned operations have been identified: a surrogate, reflexive, and transitive. A surrogate MO has the same effect as the MO it was paired with when it was learned; a reflexive MO acts as a reinforcement when it is removed; a transitive MO make something else effective as reinforcement. There is some debate as to whether an organism can be deprived or satiated from conditioned reinforcers. Theoretical note The concept of motivational operations has been applied to Maslow's hierarchy of needsMaslow, A. (1943). A theory of human motivation. Psychological Review, Vol 50(4). 370-396. doi: 10.1037/40054346. by describing the lower two levels as involving unconditioned MOs and the upper three levels as involving conditioned MOs.

It is one of the early Tamil films to be set in a contemporary social setting and to advocate reformist social policies. This was the first film for M. S. Subbulakshmi. Plot An abused wife Sumathi (M. S. Subbulakshmi) is driven out of her house by husband and later forced into prostitution. Later she reforms her ways and devotes her life to running an institution for the children of prostitutes. Production After the success of Balayogini (1937), director Subramanyam was encouraged to make more socially oriented films. In 1938 he decided to make a film version of Premchand's novel Bazaar-e-Husn. While Balayogini was about the travails of widows, Sevasadanam dealt with domestic abuse, prostitution and women's liberation. Subramanyam wrote the screenplay himself and made the film under his Madras United Artists Corporation Banner. The completed film was 18,900 feet in length with a run time of 210 minutes.

Ananda Vikatan favourably reviewed the film on 8 May 1938: As was the case with Balayogini, conservative Hindus were upset with Sevasadanam. The veteran Marxist leader N. Sankaraiah, has described Seva Sadhanam as an \\"unusual film\\" for choosing the subject of marriages between young girls and old men (which had social sanction). According to him, the film successfully broughout the \\"sufferings of the girl\\" and the \\"mental agony of the aged husband\\". Sankariah particularly appreciated F.G. Natesa Iyer's performance in the role of the old man, which he said \\" was impressive\\". Tamil film critic and historian Aranthai Narayanan observes in his book Thamizh Cinemavin Kathai (The Story of Tamil Cinema) that \\"Seva Sadhanam proved a turning point in the history of Tamil cinema. In the climax, the aged husband, now a totally changed man, was shown as casting aside with utter contempt his \`sacred thread', which symbolises his Brahmin superiority. It came as a stunning blow to the then Brahmin orthodoxy.\\" Availability No print of Sevasadanam is known to survive, making it a lost film. While K. Subrahmanyam's family only have a few surviving photographs related to the film in their possession, the complete set of 78 rpm gramophone records in their original envelopes has survived in the collection of musicologist V.

Marxism was introduced into Vietnam with the emergence of three separate communist parties; the Indochinese Communist Party, the Annamese Communist Party and the Indochinese Communist Union, later joined by a Trotskyist movement led by T·∫° Thu Th√¢u. In 1930 the Communist International (Comintern) sent Nguy·ªÖn √Åi Qu·ªëc to Hong Kong to coordinate the unification of the parties into the Vietnamese Communist Party with Tr·∫ßn Ph√∫ as its first Secretary General. Later the party changed its name to the Indochinese Communist Party because the Comintern, under Joseph Stalin, did not favor nationalistic sentiments. Nguy·ªÖn √Åi Qu·ªëc was a leftist revolutionary who had been living in France since 1911. He participated in the founding of the French Communist Party and in 1924 he traveled to the Soviet Union to join the Comintern. Through the late 1920s, he acted as a Comintern agent in order to help build Communist movements in Southeast Asia. During the 1930s, the Vietnamese Communist Party was nearly wiped out due to French suppression with the execution of its top leaders such as Ph√∫, L√™ H·ªìng Phong, and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn C·ª´. In 1941 Nguy·ªÖn √Åi Qu·ªëc, now known as H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, arrived in northern Vietnam to form the Vi·ªát Minh Front, short for Vi·ªát Nam ƒê·ªôc L·∫≠p ƒê·ªìng Minh H·ªôi (League for the Independence of Vietnam). The Vi·ªát Minh Front was supposed to be an umbrella group for all parties fighting for Vietnam's independence, but was dominated by the Communist Party. The Vi·ªát Minh had a modest armed force and, during the war, worked with the American Office of Strategic Services to collect intelligence on the Japanese. From China, other non-Communist Vietnamese parties also joined the Vi·ªát Minh and established armed forces with backing from the Kuomintang. North Vietnam Between 1953 and 2010, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including \\"rent reduction\\" and \\"land reform\\", which resulted in political repression. During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which over- extrapolated to a nationwide total of nearly 100,000 executions. Because the campaign was mainly concentrated in the Red River Delta area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions was widely accepted by scholars at the time.Dommen, Arthur J. (2001), The Indochinese Experience of the French and the Americans, Indiana University Press, p. 340, gives a lower estimate of 32,000 executions. However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500. cf. cf. Vietnam War Viet Cong prisoners in 1965. North Vietnam established the National Liberation Front on December 20, 1960, to foment insurgency in the South. Many of the Vi·ªát C·ªông's core members were volunteer \\"regroupees\\", southern Vi·ªát Minh who had resettled in the North after the Geneva Accord (1954). Hanoi gave the regroupees military training and sent them back to the South along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the early 1960s. The NLF called for Southern Vietnamese to \\"overthrow the camouflaged colonial regime of the American Imperialists\\" and to make \\"efforts towards the peaceful unification\\". The PLAF's best-known action was the Tet Offensive, a gigantic assault on more than 100 South Vietnamese urban centres in 1968, including an attack on the U.S. embassy in Saigon. The offensive riveted the attention of the world's media for weeks, but also overextended the Vi·ªát C·ªông. Later communist offensives were conducted predominantly by the North Vietnamese. The organization was dissolved in 1976 when North and South Vietnam were officially unified under a communist government. The Viet Cong are estimated to have killed about 36,725 South Vietnamese soldiers between 1957 and 1972. Statistics for 1968‚Äì72 suggest that \\"about 80 percent of the victims were ordinary civilians and only about 20 percent of them were government officials, policemen, members of the self-defence forces or pacification cadres.\\" In the former capital city of Hu·∫ø, Viet Cong troops captured the Imperial Citadel and much of the city, which led to the Battle of Hu·∫ø. During the interim between the capture of the Citadel and the end of the \\"Battle of Hu·∫ø\\", the occupying forces Massacre at Hu·∫ø. Post Vietnam War In 1975, Vietnam was officially reunified and renamed the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN), with its capital in H√† N·ªôi. The Vietnamese Communist Party dropped its front name \\"Labor Party\\" and changed the title of First Secretary, a term used in China, to Secretary-General, used in the Soviet Union, with L√™ Du·∫©n as its Secretary General. The National Liberation Front was dissolved. The Party emphasised the development of heavy industry and the collectivisation of agriculture. Over the next few years, private enterprises and private homes were seized by the government and their owners were often sent to the New Economic Zones to clear land, often to uninhabited forested areas. Members of the Vietnamese Communist Party, the North Vietnamese military or the former Viet Cong and their families were often the recipients of the confiscated properties, often in downtown areas of cities and towns. The farmers were coerced into state-controlled cooperatives. All food production was collectivized as it was in the North, forcing farmers and fishermen to sell their goods to the government at very low prices, otherwise farmers and fishermen couldn't purchase farming supplies and fishing equipment. Transportation of food and goods between provinces was deemed illegal except by the government. Within a short period of time, Vietnam was hit by severe shortages of food and basic necessities. In foreign relations, the SRVN became increasingly aligned with the Soviet Union by joining the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), and signing a Friendship Pact, which was in fact a military alliance, with the Soviet Union. Tensions between Vietnam and China mounted along with China's rivalry with the Soviet Union and conflict erupted with Cambodia, then China's ally. Vietnam was also subject to trade embargoes by the U.S. and its allies. Many of those who held high positions in the old South Vietnamese government and military, and others who profited from the colonial regime were sent to reeducation camps, which were actually hard labor prison camps. The SRVN government implemented a Stalinist dictatorship of the proletariat in the South as they did in the North. All religions had to be re-organized into state-controlled churches. Any negative comments about the Party, the government, Ho Chi Minh, or anything else that was critical of Communism might earn the person the tag of Ph·∫£n ƒê·ªông (Reactionary), with consequences ranging from harassment by the police, to expulsion from one's school or workplace, or imprisonment. Nevertheless, the Communist authority failed to suppress the black market, where food, consumer goods, and banned literature could be bought at high prices. The security apparatus also failed to stop a clandestine nationwide network of people from trying to escape the country. In many cases, the security officers of whole districts were bribed and they even got involved in organizing the escape schemes. These terrible living conditions resulted in an exodus of around 2.5 million Vietnamese secretly escaping the country either by sea or overland through Cambodia. Some were successful in fleeing the region and large numbers of them landed in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Hong Kong, only to wind up in United Nations refugee camps. Some famous camps were Bidong in Malaysia, Galang in Indonesia, Bataan in the Philippines and Songkla in Thailand. Some managed to travel as far as Australia in crowded, open boats (see Boat People). While most refugees were resettled in other countries within five years, others languished in refugee camps for over a decade. In the 1990s, refugees who could not find asylum were deported back to Vietnam. Communities of Vietnamese refugees arrived in the US, Canada, Australia, France, West Germany, and the UK. Chairman of the Communist Party Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng arrives at Joint Base Andrews, to meet U.S. President Barack Obama, 6 July 2015 Vietnam's third Constitution, based on that of the USSR, was written in 1980. The Communist Party was stated by the Constitution to be the only party to represent the people and to lead the country, according to Communist ideals. In 1980, cosmonaut Ph·∫°m Tu√¢n became the first Vietnamese person and the first Asian to go into space, traveling on the Soviet Soyuz 37 to service the Salyut 6 space station. During the early 1980s, a number of overseas Vietnamese organizations were created with the aim of overthrowing the Vietnamese Communist government through armed struggle once peaceful protesting was no longer a viable option. Most groups attempted to infiltrate Vietnam but they were eventually executed by Vietnamese security and armed forces. Most notable were the organizations led by Ho√†ng C∆° Minh from the US, V√µ ƒê·∫°i T√¥n from Australia, and L√™ Qu·ªëc T√∫y from France. Ho√†ng C∆° Minh was killed during an ambush in Laos. V√µ ƒê·∫°i T√¥n was captured and imprisoned until his release in December 1991. L√™ Qu·ªëc T√∫y stayed in France so he could undergo kidney treatment while his allies were arrested and executed in Vietnam. These organisations gained massive funding from US-aligned interest groups as from their eyes, transitioning modern-day Vietnam into a democratic system would be a superior economic and social alternative and would improve the lifestyle of many of those living under the current socialist system (which utilises many capitalist-style marketing techniques anyway), whereas Pro-Socialists in Vietnam may unwittingly see this act, even if it is viewed as benign by pro-democratics, as an act of reopening unhealed wounds. Additionally, a drastic shift in governance ideology would produce a change too vast for the Vietnamese to cope with, as evident with how Russia suffered immense drops in economic and social conditions when USSR dissolved in 1991. In the following decades of the dissolution of the USSR, only five or six of the post-communist states are on a path to joining the wealthy capitalist West while most fell behind, some to such an extent that it will take over fifty years to catch up to where they were before the fall of the Soviet Bloc, justifying that Vietnam did not need to transition to democracy anytime soon. However, throughout the 1980s, the voices of the Overseas Vietnamese and those struggling under the socialist system were not left unheard, as Vietnam made the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy. It had also received nearly $3 billion a year in economic and military aid from the Soviet Union. Most of its trade was conducted with the USSR and other COMECON (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance) countries during this time. Some cadres, realizing the economic suffering of the people, began to break the rules and experiment with market-oriented enterprises, thus, following models inspired by Western World values. This was tolerated by most local authorities before becoming widespread and popular after small business regulations loosened in the 1990s - around same the time the USSR started to dissolve. It was around this time in which Vietnam's economy started to recover and poverty levels gradually declined. Government of Vietnam The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a one-party state. A new state constitution was approved in April 1992, replacing the 1975 version. The central role of the Communist Party was reasserted in all organs of government, politics and society. Only political organizations affiliated with or endorsed by the Communist Party are permitted to contest elections. These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front, worker and trade unionist parties. The President of Vietnam is the titular head of state and the nominal commander-in-chief of the military of Vietnam, chairing the Council on National Defense and Security. The Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c is the head of government, presiding over a council of ministers composed of three deputy prime ministers and the heads of 26 ministries and commissions. The National Assembly of Vietnam is the unicameral legislature of the government, composed of 498 members. It is superior to both the executive and judicial branches, but not to the Communist Party. All members of the council of ministers (executive branch) are derived from the National Assembly. The Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, which is the highest court of appeal in the nation, is also answerable to the National Assembly. Beneath the Supreme People's Court stand the provincial municipal courts and the local courts. Military courts are also a powerful branch of the judiciary with special jurisdiction in matters of national security. All organs of Vietnam's government are controlled by the Communist Party. Most government appointees are members of the party. The General Secretary of the Communist Party is perhaps one of the most important political leaders in the nation, controlling the party's national organization and state appointments, as well as setting policy.

The sanctuary is a 60 km stretch of the Ganges River from Munger to Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district. Designated in 1991, it is protected area for the endangered Gangetic dolphins in Asia. Once found in abundance, only a few hundred remain, of which half are found here. The Gangetic dolphins have been declared as the national aquatic animal of India. This decision was taken in the first meeting of the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) chaired by Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh on Monday, 5 October 2009. Attraction Major attractions are the Ganges river dolphins (known as Soons by Locals) which are classified as endangered on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ,included in Schedule-I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and Appendix 2 of Convention of Migratory Species. The sanctuary also contains rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife, including the Indian smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 species of waterfowl. Visiting The best time to visit is October and June. Bhagalpur Junction railway station serves as the nearest railhead. Area between Sultanganj in west of Bhagalpur to Kahalgaon in east of Bhagalpur. Notably at Barari Ghat, where the Vikramshila Setu starts. Gangetic dolphin At Vikramshila Setu Threats * Multiple dams and barriers disrupting free movement of the dolphins. * Pollution by fertilisers, pesticides and industrial and domestic effluents, which are responsible for the death of many fish and are likely to have a negative effect on dolphin population. * Killing of the animals for their meat or oil (used as catfish bait), and accidental entanglement in fishing nets. Conservation There are various conservation works going on the sanctuary area. Noted works are: * The Vikramshila Biodiversity Research and Education Centre (VBREC), led by Dr. Sunil Chaudhary, together with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS), the Environmental Biology Laboratory of Patna University , and T.M. Bhagalpur University, has initiated a project to improve the conservation value of Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary. * Aaranyak, a registered conservation NGO working in North East India since 1989, has initiated a project entitled \\"Conservation of Gangetic dolphin in Brahmaputra river system, India\\" in collaboration with Dibrugarh University (Assam). The project aims to evaluate the conservation status of the Ganges river dolphin throughout the entire Brahmaputra river system by carrying out research into the species' population status, distribution, habitat preferences and threats. * WWF-India also had started the Dolphin Conservation Programme to conserve the habitat of the Ganges river dolphin and secure a future for the endangered species.

As part of the Upper Harz Water Regale it was built in the 18th century and was used to lift the water needed in Clausthal for the mining industry from the Dyke Ditch (Dammgraben) to the level of the highest pond, the Hirschler Pond. Aside from this water hoist, the Dyke Ditch supplied, and still supplies, water over ditches and tunnels to the Hausherzberg Ponds and the Lower Peacock Pond (Unterer Pfauenteich) (see also Middle Peacock Pond). The problem was however, that, as it happened, the most productive silver mines in the Upper Harz mining region, the Caroline Pit and the Dorothea Pit, were high up in the mountains and could only be supplied with water power from the Hirschler Pond. The motive force for the wooden piston pumps was won in the Polster valley below by two water wheels. The headrace for these water wheels was brought via the Heller Valley Ditch (Hellertal Graben) from the Heller valley and from the Fortune Pond over its Bottom Ditch (Grundgraben), but frictional losses and poor efficiencies meant that a considerable amount of headrace water was required in order to lift just a few litres of water from the Dyke Ditch. These wheels transferred their output power over 260 and 560 m long flat rods made of wood to the pumping station on the Polsterberg hill. In the pumping station the water from the Dyke Ditch was pumped 8 m higher and fed into drinking troughs from which it was then further transported via the Hutthal Ditch and Huttaler Widerwaage to the Hirschler Pond, or via the J√§gersbleek Tunnel and Ditch. The Polsterberg Pumphouse also acted as living accommodation for the master pumper and the ditch keepers, as well as a bar (Schankstube). At the beginning of the 20th century the wooden structures were replaced by electrically-drive pumps; the original can still be seen in the pumphouse by the ditch. Today the building is listed. It is purely run as a restaurant and is a popular destination for walkers from Altenau and Clausthal-Zellerfeld. Like the nearby Sperberhai Dam House it lies on the Harz High Road, the B 242.

Operational history The 36th Estonian Police Battalion was established on 23 November 1941, and was formed in western Estonia and on Estonian islands. Between May and August 1942, the battalion was in training and received reinforcements from other units, bringing its total stenght to 23 officers, 161 non-commissioned officers, and 254 troops. It participated at rear-security and anti-partisan operations in Belarus and guarded the prisoner-of-war camps in the coal mines of Stalino and Makeyevka.Massimo Arico, Ordnungspolizei - Encyclopedia of the German police battalions September 1939 - July 1942, p. 144-145. From 22 November to 31 December 1942 the battalion took part of the Battle of Stalingrad. Having suffered casualties of 39 killed, 97 wounded, and 11 missing, the battalion was brought back to Estonia in January 1943 and disbanded, with many men joining the Estonian Legion. 36th battalion was reformed in May 1943, and in autumn was sent to the front at Nevel where it was merged into 288th battalion. Novogrudok On 6 and 7 August 3000‚Äì5000 Jews were killed in the area of Novogrudok, Belarus. The 36th battalion was in the area at period from 4 August to 25 August 1942. The battalion's 16 August report stated that the battalion was engaged in \\"fighting against partisans\\". According to the Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity, \\"the 36th Police Battalion participated on August 7, 1942 in the gathering together and shooting of almost all the Jews still surviving in the town of Novogrudok\\".

The Commission believes that although there clearly > were numerous engagements between police units and partisans, \\"fighting > against partisans\\" and \\"guarding prisoner of war camps\\" were at times ways > of describing participation in actions against civilians, including Jews.

It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should automatically interact with it using only HTTPS connections, which provide Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL), unlike the insecure HTTP used alone. HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797. The HSTS Policy is communicated by the server to the user agent via an HTTPS response header field named \\"\`Strict-Transport-Security\`\\". HSTS Policy specifies a period of time during which the user agent should only access the server in a secure fashion. Websites using HSTS often do not accept clear text HTTP, either by rejecting connections over HTTP or systematically redirecting users to HTTPS (though this is not required by the specification). The consequence of this is that a user-agent not capable of doing TLS will not be able to connect to the site. The protection only applies after a user has visited the site at least once, and the way this protection works is that a user entering or selecting a URL to the site that specifies HTTP, will automatically upgrade to HTTPS, without making an HTTP request, which prevents the HTTP man-in-the-middle attack from occurring.  Specification history  The HSTS specification was published as RFC 6797 on 19 November 2012 after being approved on 2 October 2012 by the IESG for publication as a Proposed Standard RFC. The authors originally submitted it as an Internet Draft on 17 June 2010. With the conversion to an Internet Draft, the specification name was altered from \\"Strict Transport Security\\" (STS) to \\"HTTP Strict Transport Security\\", because the specification applies only to HTTP. The HTTP response header field defined in the HSTS specification however remains named \\"Strict-Transport-Security\\". The last so- called \\"community version\\" of the then-named \\"STS\\" specification was published on 18 December 2009, with revisions based on community feedback. The original draft specification by Jeff Hodges from PayPal, Collin Jackson, and Adam Barth was published on 18 September 2009. The HSTS specification is based on original work by Jackson and Barth as described in their paper \\"ForceHTTPS: Protecting High-Security Web Sites from Network Attacks\\". Additionally, HSTS is the realization of one facet of an overall vision for improving web security, put forward by Jeff Hodges and Andy Steingruebl in their 2010 paper The Need for Coherent Web Security Policy Framework(s).  HSTS mechanism overview  A server implements an HSTS policy by supplying a header over an HTTPS connection (HSTS headers over HTTP are ignored). For example, a server could send a header such that future requests to the domain for the next year (max-age is specified in seconds; 31,536,000 is equal to one non-leap year) use only HTTPS: \`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000\`. When a web application issues HSTS Policy to user agents, conformant user agents behave as follows (RFC 6797): # Automatically turn any insecure links referencing the web application into secure links (e.g. \`http://example.com/some/page/\` will be modified to \`https://example.com/some/page/\` accessing the server). # If the security of the connection cannot be ensured (e.g. the server's TLS certificate is not trusted), the user agent must terminate the connection (RFC 6797 section 8.4, Errors in Secure Transport Establishment) and should not allow the user to access the web application (section 12.1, No User Recourse). The HSTS Policy helps protect web application users against some passive (eavesdropping) and active network attacks. A man-in-the-middle attacker has a greatly reduced ability to intercept requests and responses between a user and a web application server while the user's browser has HSTS Policy in effect for that web application.  Applicability  The most important security vulnerability that HSTS can fix is SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks, first publicly introduced by Moxie Marlinspike in his 2009 BlackHat Federal talk \\"New Tricks For Defeating SSL In Practice\\". The SSL (and TLS) stripping attack works by transparently converting a secure HTTPS connection into a plain HTTP connection. The user can see that the connection is insecure, but crucially there is no way of knowing whether the connection should be secure. At the time of Marlinspike's talk, many websites did not use TLS/SSL, therefore there was no way of knowing (without prior knowledge) whether the use of plain HTTP was due to an attack, or simply because the website hadn't implemented TLS/SSL. Additionally, no warnings are presented to the user during the downgrade process, making the attack fairly subtle to all but the most vigilant. Marlinspike's sslstrip tool fully automates the attack. HSTS addresses this problem by informing the browser that connections to the site should always use TLS/SSL. The HSTS header can be stripped by the attacker if this is the user's first visit. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge attempt to limit this problem by including a \\"pre- loaded\\" list of HSTS sites. Unfortunately this solution cannot scale to include all websites on the internet. See limitations, below. HSTS can also help to prevent having one's cookie-based website login credentials stolen by widely available tools such as Firesheep. Because HSTS is time limited, it is sensitive to attacks involving shifting the victim's computer time e.g. using false NTP packets.  Limitations  The initial request remains unprotected from active attacks if it uses an insecure protocol such as plain HTTP or if the URI for the initial request was obtained over an insecure channel. The same applies to the first request after the activity period specified in the advertised HSTS Policy \`max-age\` (sites should set a period of several days or months depending on user activity and behavior). Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge address this limitation by implementing a \\"HSTS preloaded list\\", which is a list that contains known sites supporting HSTS. This list is distributed with the browser so that it uses HTTPS for the initial request to the listed sites as well. As previously mentioned, these pre-loaded lists cannot scale to cover the entire Web. A potential solution might be achieved by using DNS records to declare HSTS Policy, and accessing them securely via DNSSEC, optionally with certificate fingerprints to ensure validity (which requires running a validating resolver to avoid last mile issues). Junade Ali has noted that HSTS is ineffective against the use of phony domains; by using DNS-based attacks, it is possible for a Man-in-the-Middle interceptor to serve traffic from an artificial domain which is not on the HSTS Preload list, this can be made possible by DNS Spoofing Attacks, or simply a domain name that misleadingly resembles the real domain name such as www.example.org instead of www.example.com. Even with an \\"HSTS preloaded list\\", HSTS can't prevent advanced attacks against TLS itself, such as the BEAST or CRIME attacks introduced by Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong. Attacks against TLS itself are orthogonal to HSTS policy enforcement. Neither can it protect against attacks on the server - if someone compromises it, it will happily serve any content over TLS. See for a discussion of overall HSTS security considerations.  Privacy issues  HSTS can be used to near- indelibly tag visiting browsers with recoverable identifying data (supercookies) which can persist in and out of browser \\"incognito\\" privacy modes. By creating a web page that makes multiple HTTP requests to selected domains, for example, if twenty browser requests to twenty different domains are used, theoretically over one million visitors can be distinguished (220) due to the resulting requests arriving via HTTP vs. HTTPS; the latter being the previously recorded binary \\"bits\\" established earlier via HSTS headers.  Browser support  Settings page for HTTPS Strict Transport Security within Chromium 45, showing the status of the security policy for the domain \\"en.wikipedia.org\\". * Chromium and Google Chrome since version 4.0.211.0 * Firefox since version 4; with Firefox 17, Mozilla integrates a list of websites supporting HSTS. * Opera since version 12 * Safari since OS X Mavericks (version 10.9, late 2013) * Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 when KB 3058515 is installed (Released on Windows Update in June 2015) * Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10 * BlackBerry 10 Browser and WebView since BlackBerry OS 10.3.3.  Deployment best practices  Depending on the actual deployment there are certain threats (e.g. cookie injection attacks) that can be avoided by following best practices. * HSTS hosts should declare HSTS policy at their top-level domain name. For example, an HSTS host at https://sub.example.com should also answer with the HSTS header at https://example.com. The header should specify the \`includeSubDomains\` directive. * In addition to HSTS deployment, a host for https://www.example.com should include a request to a resource from https://example.com to make sure that HSTS for the parent domain is set and protects the user from potential cookie injection attacks performed by a MITM that would inject a reference to the parent domain (or even http://nonexistentpeer.example.com), which the attacker then would answer.

Sketches of Garecht's abductor were distributed along with missing person flyers throughout the San Francisco Bay Area within 24 hours of her disappearance, but search efforts proved fruitless. Her case was featured in national media, including profiles on the documentary series Unsolved Mysteries. After the 2009 discovery of Jaycee Dugard, who had been kidnapped in Meyers, California, and held captive by Phillip and Nancy Garrido for nearly two decades, renewed interest was brought on Garecht's case, and Garrido was interviewed regarding Garecht's abduction. In 2012, Wesley Shermantine, a convicted serial killer who committed various murders with his accomplice, Loren Herzog‚Äîknown collectively as the Speed Freak Killers‚Äîbrought to the attention of law enforcement that the original sketches of Garecht's abductor bore a striking similarity to Herzog, who had committed suicide while in prison in January 2012. While bone fragments discovered in one of Herzog and Shermantine's disposal sites was thought to belong to Garecht, DNA analysis completed in late 2012 proved they were not hers. Timeline Abduction Garecht was abducted at approximately 10:15 a.m. on Saturday, November 19, 1988. She and her friend, Katrina Rodriguez, left home at 10:00 a.m. and rode their scooters to the Rainbow Market, two blocks away, to purchase food and sodas. The girls left their scooters by the front door (now the side door) as they went inside the store. Upon leaving the store, the two girls started walking home, forgetting about the scooters. When they realized they had forgotten them, they turned back to where they left them; however, they saw that one scooter was missing. Garecht then spotted the scooter farther down in the market parking lot, where it had been placed near a parked car. When Garecht bent down to pick the scooter up by the handle bars, an unidentified white male came out of the parked car, picked her up with his right arm around her waist, and put her into his car as she screamed. Rodriguez recalled the scene: \\"I looked up when I heard a scream, and I saw a man putting her into his car. She was still screaming. I just stood and watched, frozen in shock.\\" The only witness to the abduction, Rodriguez ran back into the store to get help. The abductor escaped with Garecht, while Rodriguez notified a female clerk who phoned police to report the kidnapping. At the time of her abduction, Garecht was wearing a t-shirt with the word \\"Metro\\" on the front, rolled-up denim jeans, black Mary Jane shoes, and pearl-colored feather-shaped earrings. Witness' description In the 9-1-1 transcript, the female store clerk who phoned police on behalf of Rodriguez described the man who allegedly abducted her as \\"hippy-like\\" in appearance. However, it was subsequently revealed that the clerk had offered an incorrect description of the man, and had inadvertently mistaken him for someone else she had seen driving in the parking lot. The clerk described a man in his thirties with a mustache, driving a burgundy- colored car, a false description which was erroneously distributed in the media for nearly two days following Garecht's abduction. Journalist Dennis Oliver commented: Rodriguez, the sole witness to the abduction, described Garecht's captor as a white male in his twenties. The most distinguishing characteristic was that he seemed to have severe acne or pockmarks on his face. He had shoulder length, dirty blonde hair. He was around in height and had a slender build. The witness described him as having fox-like, blue eyes and wearing a white T-shirt. According to Garecht's friend, the abductor drove a large, older model, American-made sedan. It was possibly a four-door vehicle and was either cream or tannish gold in color. The car may have had cement splatters on the sides and lights set into the rear bumper. The front bumper was battered; the vehicle appeared run-down, it may have previously been in an accident. The car was last seen speeding south on Mission Boulevard toward nearby Union City, California, with Garecht inside. Initial search efforts Garecht's kidnapping led to one of the most extensive police investigations by the Hayward Police department and they received 5,000 tips in the first year alone. In the days following Garecht's abduction, police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched hillsides, parks, and unpopulated areas in southern Alameda County by helicopter and airplane. Forensic inspection of Garecht's scooter yielded fingerprints from an unknown source, which law enforcement believed may have belonged to Garecht's abductor. On November 30, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana made a public plea for the safe return of Garecht. The majority of the tips submitted occurred within the first month of Garecht's abduction, as it was reported by The San Francisco Examiner that approximately 4,000 tips had been received by late December 1988. In this December report, an officer from the Hayward Police Department commented: \\"The only way we are closer to finding out what happened is that we have eliminated so many leads in this case. But as far as knowing who did it, or why, or what happened to her... we're no closer.\\" A reward fund of over $70,000 was posted at this time for anyone who could provide information of Garecht's whereabouts. At the time of the kidnapping, Garecht's photo was featured as a missing child on milk cartons and billboards nationally and thousands of fliers and posters were spread throughout the community; within a day of her disappearance, family and volunteers had distributed 42,000 missing person fliers. In December 1992, a false lead was produced in Garecht's case a prison inmate in Indiana named Roger Haggard claimed to have buried Garecht's body in the Hunters Point area of San Francisco. Upon further inquiry, Haggard alternately claimed he buried Garecht in a gladiolus field in Union City. Haggard was flown to San Francisco to recover Garecht's body, but after eight hours of inspecting the alleged field, he admitted he had invented the story, resulting in an additional six-and-a- half years being added to his preexisting sentence. In 1994, The Daily Review reported that police had followed up more than 15,000 leads. More than three decades later, the investigation at the Hayward Police Station continues. Chief investigator Inspector Robert Lampkin declared, \\"We'll go anywhere, any corner of the earth to try to bring Michaela home\\". Later developments and suspects =Tim Bindner= Law enforcement considered the kidnapping of Amber Swartz in Pinole in June 1988 as potentially connected, given its proximity to Hayward. Tim Bindner, a man who injected himself into the search for Swartz, became a suspect in her disappearance, as well as that of Garecht. He was also considered a suspect in the disappearance of Ilene Mishelhoff, a 13-year-old who vanished from Dublin, California in 1989, and Amanda Campbell, who went missing Fairfield in 1991. However, Bindner has repeatedly denied involvement in any of the disappearances. In 1997, a book titled Stalemate: A Shocking True Story of Child Abduction and Murder by forensic psychologist John Philpin was published, detailing Bindner's involvement in the investigations surrounding these various disappearances. =Phillip Garrido= The 2009 reappearance of kidnapped schoolgirl Jaycee Lee Dugard, after 18 years in captivity, led police to be initially hopeful that Dugard's abductor, Phillip Garrido, might have also been involved in Garecht's disappearance. Hayward is within an hour's drive from Garrido's Antioch home in Contra Costa County, and Garecht's abduction took place three months after Garrido was freed from prison for rape and kidnapping. Like Garecht, Dugard was also thrown into the back of a car in broad daylight and in the presence of witnesses. The general description of the kidnapper and the car used in both kidnappings are also similar. The Hayward Police Department conducted an extensive investigation into the Garridos, and no evidence linking them to Garecht's abduction was found. The connection did, however, propel Garecht back into national and international attention and brought forth new leads. =Loren Herzog= Loren Herzog, one of the Speed Freak Killers, bore a strong resemblance to the police sketch In August 2012, Wesley Shermantine, one of the so-called Speed Freak Killers duo, wrote a letter to The Stockton Record after his partner in crime, Loren Herzog, committed suicide in January 2012, in which he pointed out that Herzog bore a resemblance to the composite of the person who kidnapped \\"that Hayward girl.\\" Shermantine and Herzog, who were apprehended in 1999, are suspected of having committed up to 19 murders in Northern California. Commenting on the likeness Herzog bore to Garecht's kidnapper, witness Katrina Rodriguez commented: \\"I thought then and I think now he could be the kidnapper... I think there are features that look very much like the man...It seems like a strong lead.\\" At Shermantine's direction, law enforcement began excavating an abandoned well in rural Linden, California in February 2012, where Herzog and Shermantine disposed of their victims. Thousands of bone fragments belonging to five different individuals were recovered from the well, some of which were believed to potentially belong to Garecht. However, DNA analysis completed later that year excluded Garecht as a possibility; the bones believed to have been hers were determined to be those of 19-year-old Kimberly Billy, who had disappeared in 1984. In January 2013, further excavations of abandoned wells in the area were completed, but yielded no further remains. In 2015, a legal motion was filed by attorney Mark Geragos on behalf of a detective who was informed by a San Joaquin sheriff's deputy that a pair of Mary Jane shoes discovered in one of the Linden wells bore similarity to the shoes Garecht was last seen wearing. According to the detective, San Joaquin police refused to show him the shoes, both physically as well in photographs, and, as of March 2015, the shoes had not been examined by the Hayward Police Department. Cultural significance Garecht's kidnapping was a high-profile missing-child case, and received national media attention. Her case was the first missing-child case to feature on America's Most Wanted in 1988. The case featured once again on the show in 2009. The case has also featured on numerous other television shows: In 1988, it was profiled on Unsolved Mysteries, which aired in January 1989. In 1999, Katrina Rodriguez, Garecht's friend who witnessed her kidnapping, appeared on the Maury show. In 2009, Garecht's kidnapping was profiled on Dateline NBC and Larry King Live. The case has also caught the attention of the international media. The anniversary of Garecht's kidnapping has been marked every year at the location where the kidnapping took place. Numerous ribbons, new and old, are tied to the tree next to where the kidnapper's car was parked. Her mother, Sharon, maintains a blog dedicated to her daughter. In May 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation posted a $10,000 reward for information regarding Garecht's disappearance. , Garecht's case is still open.

It is under the College of Art and Social Sciences. History KNUST provides education for scientists and technologists. Since the graduates of the university have to function in society, the Faculty of Social Sciences was established to offer courses in liberal arts and social sciences. In 1970 a department of law was established in the Faculty of Social Sciences to teach land law as a 'core' subject in the BSc Land Economy and Management programme. Not long afterwards a combined honours degree of Economics/Law, Sociology/ Law, Geography/Law etc. was developed. The Department of Law also taught law courses in other faculties of the university. In 2002, the university decided that the social sciences faculty must undergo modern transformation, allowing a Faculty of Law to emerge. In April 2003, the Council of KNUST approved a 4-year LLB programme, and the first cohort of LLB students were admitted into the Faculty of Law in August 2003. KNUST provides training in law and promotes the development of a distinctly Ghanaian body of law through teaching and research. The graduates of the law faculty will fulfil the manpower needs of the country as graduates of law are required not only to practise law, but to work in important sectors of the economy. Teaching and learning strategies Course delivery includes seminars, tutorials, workshops and moots. There is use of case studies as vehicles for exercising particular topics, for example, Introduction to Trial Advocacy Course requires students to act out a simulated case, and to learn the taking of instructions to the trial of the matter. In the Law of Contract, a case study is used to illustrate aspects of the law including the formation, terms, discharge and remedies. Students will be involved in oral presentations as well as written submissions. Students acquire intellectual skills (research, analysis and problem-solving); transferable skills (study & communication, skills, time-management and group work; and legal skills (drafting, research, advocacy, interviewing and negotiation). Assessment on the LLB programme follows university regulations and consists of written coursework, oral presentations and examinations. Where appropriate group work as well as individual performance is assessed. Law Library The Law Library provides a research level, retrospective, and current collection of Ghanaian and African law materials; and provides the classic professional texts relating to the law of countries such as the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. Students have access to photocopying, microfilm and microfiche equipment, commercial databases on CDROM and the library‚Äôs own databases, which will be developed as a basis for a Ghana legal information service. The library staff develop and maintain the collections, on a reserve and loan system; they help students to find the meanings of legal citations, and to locate the cited material.

He was surnamed Philoromaeus (Lover of Rome) and is usually believed to have lived about the time of Cicero and Julius Caesar. Background Castor is frequently referred to as an authority in historical matters.Euseb. Praep. Evang. x. 3, Chron. i. 13, p. 36; Justin Mart. Paraen. ad Graec. p. 9. A partiality to the Romans is suggested by the surname Philoromaeus, and may have been evident in a work mentioned by PlutarchQuaest. Rom. 10, 76, comp. De Is. et Os. 31. as comparing the institutions of Rome with those of Pythagoras. The Suda describes the grammarian and rhetorician Castor as a son-in-law of the Galatian king Deiotarus (whom it calls a Roman senator), who afterwards put both Castor and his wife to death because Castor had brought charges against him before Caesar, evidently alluding to the affair in which Cicero defended Deiotarus. This appears to be the same Castor, mentioned by Strabo,Strabo, xii. p. 568; comp. Caes. B. C. iii. 4. who was surnamed Saecondarius, was a son-in-law of Deiotarus, and was put to death by him. When Cicero spoke for Deiotarus, the Castor who brought Deiotarus into peril is expressly called a grandson of that king, and was yet a young man at the time (44 BC).Cic. pro Deiot. 1, 10. It is however uncertain if this was the same Castor as the rhetorician, Castor of Rhodes. One of the works of Castor is referred to in the Bibliotheke formerly ascribed to Apollodorus of Athens, who died sometime around 140 BC. Because of this circumstance, one conclusion is that the rhetorician Castor must have lived at or before the time of Apollodorus, around 150 BC, and thus had no connection with the Deiotarus for whom Cicero spoke.Compare Vossius, De Hist. Graec. p. 202, ed. Westermann; Orelli, Onomast. Tull. ii. p. 138, in both of which there is much confusion about Castor. Another common conclusion, which assumes Castor of Rhodes really was contemporary with Caesar and Cicero, is that Bibliotheke could not have been written by Apollodorus, hence the appellation \\"Pseudo- Apollodorus\\" for this work. Works According to the Suda,Suda Œ∫ 402 Castor composed the following works: *Anagraphe ton Thalassokratesanton (\\"Record of Thalassocrasies\\") in two books. *Chronika Agnoemata (\\"Chronological Errors\\") which is also referred to by the Bibliotheca.Pseudo-Apollodorus 2.1.3. *Peri Epicheirematon (\\"On Arguments or Adventures\\"), in nine books. *Peri Peithous (\\"On Persuasion\\"), in two books. *Peri tou Neilou (\\"On the Nile\\"). *Techne Rhetorike (\\"Rhetorical Art\\") *Chronologia or Chronika, which is referred to several times by Eusebius of Cesarea.

This letter outlined his broad vision and a very practical proposal which helped the U.K. Government to establish legal basis for national schools in Ireland.Irish Educational Documents, vol. 1, √Åine Hyland, Kenneth Milne, Church of Ireland College of Education, pp.98-103 The letter was written two years after the government led by Field Marshal The 1st Duke of Wellington, in alliance with the Daniel O'Connell, secured the passage and Royal Proclamation of the Catholic Emancipation bill. It was penned by the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Edward Stanley (later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as The 14th Earl of Derby) and was addressed to the 3rd Duke of Leinster. The proposal in the Stanley letter was considered a policy experiment especially from the view that \\"Ireland, as a colony could be used as an experimental milieu for social legislation which might not be tolerated in England where laissez-faire politico-economic policies were more rigid and doctrinaire.\\" This was also the case for Irish initiatives involving the police force and health services. Stanley's framework involved the establishment of \\"a board for the superintendence of a system of national education\\" integrating key measures and educational conventions in place in Ireland such as the state- supported, mass system foundered on the denominational issue. In line with the Letter's suggestions, a Board of Commission of National Education was established which disbursed funds for school building, the hiring of teachers and inspectors and provided grants for schools. The Board tried to mix Catholic and Protestant students by favouring applications for 'mixed' schools. However, in the years after the 1830s, different religious denominations begin to apply separately for control of schools to the extent that in 2010, approximately 1 percent of schools (34 out of 3279) are not under the control of a religious organization, with the remaining 99 percent under religious control. The new policy was credited for spreading literacy, especially to the poor communities. By 1831, the national schools based on Stanley's model has enrolled more than 100,000 children, a figure that increased to almost 1 million within 40 years. Teacher training was also enhanced. For example, the paid monitors, the lowest grade teachers, were evaluated annually using the instructional materials used in schools. The Stanley letter remains today the legal basis for all national schools in the Republic of Ireland, the predominant form of primary education in the country.The Blackwell companion to modern Irish culture, W.

Manufactured between 300‚Äì100 BC. 3) Fragments of torc apparently from southwestern France The Stirling torcs make up a hoard of four gold Iron Age torcs, a type of necklace, all of which date to between 300 and 100 BC and which were buried deliberately at some point in antiquity. They were found by a metal detectorist in a field near Blair Drummond, Stirlingshire, Scotland on 28 September 2009. The hoard has been described as the most significant discovery of Iron Age metalwork in Scotland and is said to be of international significance. The torcs were valued at ¬£462,000, and after a public appeal were acquired for the National Museums of Scotland in March 2011. Discovery The finder was a novice metal detectorist, David Booth, who found the torcs on his first treasure-hunting outing, using a basic model metal detector. Having identified an area he considered to be of good potential, Booth obtained the landowner's permission to search on his land. > I parked up and got the metal detector out. There was an area of flat ground > behind the car, and I thought, I‚Äôll just scan this first, before I head out > into the field. Literally about seven steps behind where I had parked, I > found them. Booth took the torcs home and washed them in water. After researching them on the internet, he completed a form on the Scottish Treasure Trove website and sent a photograph to the Scottish Treasure Trove Unit at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Dr Fraser Hunter said he \\"almost fell off [his] seat\\" when he first saw photographs of the discovery the next morning, and members of staff had arrived at the site within three hours.https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/04/metal-detectorist-finds-gold- treasure The subsequent archaeological excavation at the site exposed the remains of a wooden roundhouse but found no more artefacts. The torcs All four torcs were buried together, some below the surface. Subsequent archaeological investigations determined that the torcs had originally been buried within a roundhouse, a prehistoric circular building. This building may have had religious significance, as hoard finds tend to be either votive offerings to the gods, or items of great value that had been hidden in time of unrest or war, and because the building did not seem to have features like a hearth associated with a dwelling. All four torcs date to between 300 and 100 BC, they are highly and unexpectedly varied in form and style which greatly adds to the significance of the find. Two twisted ribbon torcs (numbered 1‚Äì2 in the photo of the display), in perfect condition, are elegant and relatively simple in design. They are fashioned from a flat strip of gold which has then been twisted, and represent a local style of jewellery, originating equally from Scotland and Ireland, and going back to the Late Bronze Age. One has plain hooked terminals while the other has more decorative disc terminals.MOS The third torc is broken, with only half of the original artefact surviving in two fragments. It is a tubular annular torc, which would have had a hinge and catch. It is of ornate design compared to the ribbon torcs, and experts have identified it as a type originating from the Toulouse area in southern France. It is the first of its kind to have been found in Britain.MOS The fourth torc is a looped terminal torc, complete and in good condition. It is made from eight gold wires twisted together. It has intricately decorated terminals and has a short length of safety chain. It has been described by Dr Fraser Hunter, Iron Age and Roman curator at the National Museum of Scotland, as a remarkable hybrid of Mediterranean craftsmanship and more traditional Iron Age motifs. This might have been made for a local chieftain by a craftsman who had learned his craft in the Mediterranean region, and with the third torc suggests significant links between Scotland and Southern Europe. There are no directly comparable other artefacts. The last significant find of torcs in Scotland was in 1857, when gold ribbon torcs were found on Law Farm, Moray.MOS; Cahill, 120. The eclecticism of the styles and origins is comparable to that of the objects in the Broighter Hoard from Northern Ireland, probably of a slightly later period. After discovery Following the completion of the archaeological excavations, the torcs were made public on 4 November 2009 when they were shown to the press in Edinburgh by Booth and museum staff at the National Museum of Scotland. According to Scottish Treasure Trove laws, the crown can claim any archaeological objects found in Scotland. Finders have no ownership rights and must report any objects to Scotland's Treasure Trove Unit. Booth is entitled to a reward equal to the value of the torcs. Dr David Caldwell of the Scottish Treasure Trove Unit said that the torcs would \\"definitely\\" stay in Scotland. In October 2010 the torcs were valued at ¬£462,000 by the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel, and the crown stated it would allocate the torcs to National Museums Scotland if the museum made an ex-gratia payment of ¬£462,000 to the finder, David Booth; National Museums Scotland had until April 2011 to raise the required sum of money. By March 2011 the amount was raised by a public appeal and significant grants by the Art Fund and the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and the hoard was acquired.

Built near the start of the 18th century, it is one of Clinton's oldest surviving buildings, which is especially noted for its unusual floorplan. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The William Stevens House is located in a rural-suburban setting in northern Clinton, on the west side of Cow Hill Road just north of its junction with Airline Road. It is set facing south, separated from the street by a low stone wall. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, 3 bays wide, with a side gable roof and a large central chimney. The rear of the house has a leanto section, giving it a saltbox appearance, from which a modern single-story addition extends further. The house is distinctive in part because of an extremely non-standard floorplan. Instead of a tight winding stair in the front vestibule, the chimney in the house is set further back than normal in houses of the period, and the stair rises via a dogleg and straight run to the chimney's left. Conventional houses of the period of fireplaces on the sides of the chimney in the two front chambers, while in this house, because of the chimney location, they are on the front. and The house's construction date is uncertain: it is usually attributed to William Stevens (1630-1703), placing it in the late 17th or early 18th century. Stevens was the England-born son of John Stevens, one of the early settlers of the New Haven Colony. Nine generations of descendants of Stevens owned the house, their period of ownership ending in the 1970s. Architectural historians theorize that the house began as a small (one-room) residence on Stevens-owned farmland, and was gradually enlarged, explaining its unusual plan.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History of the State Theatre The State Theatre building dates back to 1915. Designed by local architect Henry N. Hinckley, it was originally the Ithaca Security Company auto garage and dealership. The Berinstein family purchased the building in 1928. They hired architect Victor Rigaumont to design and oversee the transformation of the garage and showroom into a cinema and vaudeville palace, Rigaumont incorporated elements of the Moorish and Renaissance Revival Styles and the Collegiate Gothic symbolism of Cornell University. Opening night was on December 6, 1928. Beginning with vaudeville, the theater has evolved with the times. When movies became more popular in the early 1930s, the theater thrived primarily as a cinema house. After World War II, with the advent of television and suburban movies houses, downtown cinema palaces like the State struggled. To adapt, the owners added a second movie screen in the 1970s, dividing the balcony from the main house. Ultimately, the theater closed in the 1980s because of financial difficulties and the demands of long-deferred maintenance. Attempts to revive the theater over the next fifteen years have failed, though the community succeeded in having the theater listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Finally, in 1997, the theater was condemned by the City of Ithaca because of serious roof damage, a failing heating an ventilation system, and the safety hazards caused by falling plaster and out-of-date electrical systems. The owners seriously, though reluctantly, considered demolition. Community anxiety about the State Theatre was intense. Downtown Ithaca once boasted seventeen grand theaters, including the Lyceum, the Crescent, and the Strand. The State Theatre is the last remaining cinema and vaudeville palace in Ithaca. In May 1998, With community support, the organization purchased the failing structure and assumed the role of preservationist, developer and manager, establishing the State Theatre Restoration Project. Historic Ithaca staff and volunteers accepted the daunting task of reversing the building's condemnation. This included replacement or serious repair of the main roof, the dangerously disintegrated plaster walls, the outdated electrical systems, the fire detection system, and the heating and ventilation systems. Strong community support bolstered this first phase of the project and secured funding from municipal, foundation and private donors; leaders from the business, arts, preservation and political communities were involved. In 1999, the American Institute of Architects recognized the State Theatre as one of the most significant architectural landmarks in New York State. Between 1998 and December 2001, Phase I of the State Theatre Restoration Project was completed. After years of community effort the State Theatre regained its occupancy permit, and the theater re-opened on December 5, 2001. In the spring of 2009, The State Theatre of Ithaca, Inc., a newly formed 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, purchased the State Theatre from Historic Ithaca.http://stateofithaca.com/about/history The State Theatre today The State Theatre consists of a primary staff of Executive Director Doug Levine, Official Talent Buyer Dan Smalls Presents,http://www.dansmallspresents.com/ Director of Theater Operations Jean Hubbell, Director of Marketing Casey Martin, House Manager Carrie Calhoun and Back of House Manager Bob Andrews.http://stateofithaca.com/about/staff A twelve-member board of directors oversees the State Theatre of Ithaca.http://stateofithaca.com/board.html Volunteers assist as ushers, ticket takers, concessions workers, office helpers, and stagehands.

They visited Medinipur, Bankura, Singhbhum, Seraikela, Kharsawan, Chainbasa, Chakradharpur, Tarala, Tikili and Manjusha in the summer holidays to interact with people in Oriya and preach national integrity. In the 9 August 1942 revolution, he and his friends hoisted the Indian National Flag at Ravenshaw College and subsequently took leave of absence from the college. His passion for higher studies and his wish to be a part of the freedom struggle took him to Kolkata, where he got admission into Vidyasagar College under the University of Calcutta to finish his M.A. He joined the Paschim Banga Chhatra Congress and used to write handbills and posters against the British Government at night. On 16 August 1946, there was a massive Hindu-Muslim riot in Bengal.

Nathaniel Jennison was a decisive court case in Massachusetts in 1783 which effectively abolished slavery in that state.Note: the commonwealth's legis;lature never passed a law abolishing slavery and slavery remained technically legal until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery in all the states in 1865. It was the third in a series of cases which became known as the Quok Walker cases. Nathaniel Jennison was arrested for beating Quock Walker and indicted on a criminal charge of assault and battery in September 1781. The trial before the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was held in April 1783. Jennison's defense was that Walker was a runaway slave but Walker countered that the Massachusetts Constitution had made slavery illegal in 1780. Chief Justice William Cushing accepted this argument and directed the jury that the issue of whether Walker had been freed or not was irrelevant because slavery was no longer constitutional. The jury convicted Jennison who was fined forty shillings. The case was not widely publicized but it made it clear that the law would not defend the property rights of slave-owners. Because this law depended on the enslaved person to take action to gain their freedom (either appealing to the courts or running away), people without the knowledge or the means to act continued to be held as slaves for years after the ruling. Slavery (or the willingness to reveal its presence) declined so that, by the time of the 1790 census, no slaves were recorded in this state. However, it's understood that many former slaveowners reclassified their former slaves as still-legal \\"Indentured Servants.Hardesty, Jared Ross (2019). Black Lives Native Lands White Worlds.

It includes fourteen houses, most of which were built in a two-year period between 1843 and 1845. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history Lincoln Street is an east-west residential street, one block in length, extending west from Maine Street (Maine State Route 24), Brunswick's principal downtown thoroughfare. The land on which it was laid out was acquired over a multi-year period by Dr. Isaac Lincoln, a professor at Bowdoin College's Maine Medical School for many years. In response to local demand for housing, Lincoln subdivided the land and sold off most of the lots in 1843. Lincoln created uniformly-sized lots, and specified minimum setback requirements for the houses that were built on them. The result is a cohesive streetscape, representative of residential development of the period. Except for the commercial buildings facing Maine Street, the street is lined on both sides with residential buildings. All are 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 stories in height, and are a mixture of wood frame and brick construction. There are fourteen houses, seven on each side, including four duplexes. Most of these houses were built between 1843 and 1845 and are Greek Revival in style; one of the others is a 1772 house moved from Maine Street and given a Colonial Revival facade treatment. There is one house that was built in 1871, which has Italianate style; a number of the earlier houses also exhibit Italianate alterations. The Richardson House at 11 Lincoln Street is separately listed on the National Register, as one of the region's finest examples of transitional Greek Revival-Italianate architecture.

It was scripted by David Eyre and Robert Ward from Robert Ward's book and directed by Lamont Johnson. Plot The outlaws the girls find are the demoralized remnants of the Doolin-Dalton gang, led by an historically inaccurately aged Bill Doolin (Burt Lancaster at 67). Anna Emmaline McDoulet, or Cattle Annie (Amanda Plummer), shames and inspires the men to become what she had imagined them to be. The younger sister (but historically not a relative) Jennie Stevens or Little Britches (Diane Lane) finds a father figure in Doolin, who in the story line coined her nickname \\"Little Britches\\". Doolin's efforts to live up to the girls' vision of him lead him to be carted off in a cage to an Oklahoma jail where he waits to be hanged. With the help of the girls and the gang, Doolin escapes and rides off to safety with his men. The girls are triumphant, but they cannot escape Marshal Bill Tilghman (Rod Steiger) and are sent back East to the reformatory in Framingham, Massachusetts.

It was 105 degrees, and the ambulance broke down on the way to the hospital. \\"He got out and pushed,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get him to behave‚Äù. Reaction The film was favorably reviewed by the critic Pauline Kael in The New Yorker. \\" The cinematography [by Larry Pizer] is vivid ‚Ä¶ the colors are strikingly crisp and intense. The dialogue and most of the incidents have a neat, dry humor. It's a wonderful, partly true story ‚Ä¶ there are some wonderful performances. As Bill Doolin, Lancaster (who made the film before Atlantic City) is a gent surrounded by louts ‚Äî a charmer. When he talks to his gang he uses the lithe movements and the rhythmic, courtly delivery that his Crimson Pirate had when he told his boys to gather round. In his scenes with Diane Lane, the child actor who appeared in New York in several of Andrei Serban's stage productions, and who single handedly made the film A Little Romance almost worth seeing, Lancaster has an easy tenderness that is never overdone. Lancaster looks happy in the movie and still looks tough: it's an unbeatable combination. Young Amanda Plummer gives a scarily brilliant performance.\\" Pauline Kael reprinted in the collection Taking It All In References External links 1981 films 1980s Western (genre) films American Western (genre) films American films English-language films Films directed by Lamont Johnson Films set in the 1890s Films set in Oklahoma Biographical films about outlaws of the American Old West ","title":"Cattle Annie and Little Britches"},{"id":"25132428","text":"Anaxita decorata, the decorated beauty, is a moth of the family Erebidae.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.  History  Jafet J. Rytkonen was born in Finland in 1879 and came to Negaunee to work in the iron mines in 1902. However, he quickly changed professions and partnered with John Lammi to open a grocery and soda pop business. In 1911, Rytkonen partnered with August Allen to build and operate the Star Theater, located a short distance from the current site of the Vista. In 1925, Rytkonen purchased the lot where the Vista stands in order to build a new theater.PAAC History, Peninsula Arts Appreciation Council, 2005. Retrieved 11/19/2008 Rytkonen wanted to construct a larger, grander, and more modern theatre than the Star. Rytkonen hired architect David E. Anderson of Iron River to design the Vista, and construction began in the spring of 1925. Rytkonen hired Pfeffer Construction Company of Duluth, Minnesota and John Kielinen of Ishpeming to construct the Vista, and Trembath Brothers of Ishpeming to do the interior decorating. The new theatre opened on September 20, 1926. Rytkonen ran the theatre until his retirement in 1950, after which his son, William, and son-in-law, Peter Ghiardi, took over management of the Vista. The Vista Theater remained open until 1972, when William Rytkonen died. In 1973, a group of local citizens formed the Peninsula Arts Appreciation Council (PAAC). This group took over the Vista and in 1975 began using it as a venue for multiple artistic forms, including amateur theater productions, musical programs and concerts, films, puppet shows, art exhibits, and arts workshops. In the 2000s, the group began restoration of the theatre, and on July 22, 2005 the structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. PAAC continues to operate the Vista and in 2014 thanks to a grant from the Cliffs/Eagle Foundation installed a digital projector and screen making it one of the few facilities left in the United States that acts as both a playhouse and movie theater. On August 26, 2020, a large section of the roof over the seating area collapsed. The Vista Theater Advisory Board began working to stabilize the walls and clean the interior before the start of winter. The board started a fundraiser to raise $100,000 for the repairs. Architecture The Vista is a three-story Commercial Brick theater which was designed both for stage and motion picture productions. It measures 50 feet by 150 feet, and is constructed of yellow-buff brick over hollow tile. The facade has a slightly projecting bay at each end flanking a central entrance area. The projecting bays each contain a large rectangular panel of basket-weave brickwork, and the central area contains the entryway on the first floor, and broad banks of square-head windows on the second floor, and broadly arched windows on the third floor.

Dicziunari rumantsch. Ladin - tudais-ch. Chur. Jauer ([]) is a dialect of Romansh that is spoken in the Val M√ºstair. It is closely related to the neighboring dialect of the Lower Engadine, Vallader as well as Put√®r spoken the Upper Engadine. The name of the dialect is derived from a nickname based on the personal pronoun jau [] 'I', and can be translated as 'the jau-sayers',Curdin & Schl√§pfer (1984). p. 261, 265 as this contrasts with Vallader eu, pronounced [], [], [], [], or [] in the Lower Engadine.Ricarda Liver (2010). R√§toromanisch. Eine Einf√ºhrung in das B√ºndnerromanische. Narr, T√ºbingen. S. 67. Other features distinguishing Jauer from Vallader include the placement of stress on the penultimate syllable of certain verbs, as well as the infinitive verb ending -er as opposed to Vallader -ar. In addition, stressed /a/ is diphthongized in Jauer. All three traits can be seen in the verb 'to sing', which is chant√†r in Vallader but ch√†unter in Jauer.  Sociolinguistics  According to the Swiss census of 2000, 86.4% in the Val M√ºstair report to speak Romansh habitually, and 74.1% declare it as their language of best command.Gross, Manfred (2004), Romanisch ‚Äì Facts & Figures (in German), Chur This amounts to around 1,400 speakers in absolute numbers in the year 2000. Jauer is usually not written; the written standard in Val M√ºstair is traditionally Vallader. Jauer is occasionally written regardless, and in 2007, a collection of short stories written in Jauer (Dschon Uein id atras istorias grischunas) was published.Plinio Meyer (2007). Dschon Uein id atras istorias grischunas, 978-385637-342-9. Uniun dals Grischs, Celerina In official use and as the language of school, Vallader has traditionally been used in the Val M√ºstair. In 2007, the valley was one of the first municipalities of the canton to introduce the pan-regional Romansh variety Rumantsch Grischun as the language of schooling and official use. In 2012 however, a municipal assembly voted to return to the use of Vallader in schools. As with other Romansh speakers, virtually all speakers of Jauer with the exception of children below school-age are also proficient in both Swiss German and Swiss Standard German. Additionally, many people in Val M√ºstair also speak Bavarian German as a second language due to contacts with neighboring South Tyrol.Cathomas (2008).

Next to Henny Porten and Asta Nielsen, she was one of the most popular and well known actresses in German silent film. Biography Vernal Edna Andrews was born in Watseka, Illinois on November 24, 1893, the daughter of William P. Andrews and Sarah Emily Evett, also known as Sadie. Vernal was of English and Scottish descent on her father's side whilst she was of English and German on her mother's. When William died in 1898, Sadie remarried Frank St. Clair, a vaudeville actor, circus performer and tight-rope walker. Andra was already appearing in public in a tightrope act by the age of four. She later trained in song and dance. As early as 1899, in New York, she made her first film, a version of Uncle Tom's Cabin. However, she remained with the circus, with which she embarked on an extensive tour across the United States, Canada and Europe. For a time, she was a member of Bird Millman's acclaimed troupe of wire artists.\\"Marriages: Millman-[O‚ÄôDay]; Fern Andra,\\" Billboard, May 10, 1924, p. 114 In Berlin she met Max Reinhardt, who gave her acting lessons.

From 1916-18 she appeared almost exclusively on camera with Alfred Abel. In 1920 she starred in Robert Wiene's expressionist horror film Genuine. In the mid-1920s she lost her public appeal in Germany. On July 4, 1922, she was involved in the Hamburg-Berlin mail plane accident.

After Live Labs were shut down the stand-alone Pivot application is being hosted by Microsoft Research. Download Pivot The Silverlight control is still available, though.Silverlight PivotViewer control Functionality Microsoft Pivot was Microsoft Live Labs most ambitious project. It is a program based on the Seadragon technology. More specifically, it is ‚Äúa data visualization technology called Pivot, designed to help people make better use of digital information‚Äù. Pivot is a data mining system that ‚Äúallows people to visualize data and then sort, organize and categorize it dynamically‚Äù, which results in correlations and trends that become immediately apparent in a visually interactive format. Capabilities Pivot is a program designed to contextualize information in a much more natural way for humans to digest large quantities of information without losing their way. Most specifically it combines related data ‚Äî ‚Äúanything from pictures, videos and maps to batting averages and financials ‚Äî into large collections that can then be manipulated, sorted, filtered and examined visually‚Äù. In this way, the data itself can help shape and inform the way it is presented. Thus, instead of having to struggle to understand data and then apply it to a problem, Pivot works in unison with a person to come to an optimal solution. Currently information seekers are stuck in the old way of viewing information, limited by browsers to view information only in the context of ‚Äúnext‚Äù and ‚Äúprevious‚Äù. Pivot allows users to aggregate this information and view it to see if there are any recognizable patterns in the information. The value of such tool is that you can begin exploring with an idea and Pivot works with users to discover information that might have otherwise not been seen. This is important because it has been found that ‚Äúif you make it a sudden transition, people lose their way‚Ä¶but if you make it very smooth and continuous, people have a mental model of how they got to where they are.‚Äù Another interesting aspect about Pivot is that it works with any type of data. In fact, the Pivot Collections range from Wikipedia entries to the 2009 International Union for Conservation of Nature Endangered List. This gives Pivot immense value because its capabilities are transferable to any industry. How Pivot Works At the heart of the Pivot program are the Collections that combine large groups of similar information ‚Äúso we can begin viewing the Web as a \\"web\\" rather than a series of isolated pages‚Äù. New collections can be created with no programming and are composed of a collection of data. These data collections are composed of two components, the XML (the descriptive component of the collection), and the images (the visual representation of the data). Pivot is able to filter through images and information seamlessly because the images are described in Deep Zoom format, a component of the Seadragon Technology.

Background Future Real Estate founders Martin Courtney, Matt Mondanile and Alex Bleeker had already played music together in various permutations as students at Ridgewood High School in Ridgewood, New Jersey. While studying in different colleges, they kept in touch and would send each other songs that they had worked on individually. Courtney's demos were impressive enough to inspire them to form another band after graduating and returning home to Ridgewood in 2008. They were joined on drums by Etienne Pierre Duguay, who had formed a band called Predator Vision with Mondanile in Northampton and also played with Mondanile, Courtney and Bleeker as the backing band for Julian Lynch. The quartet jammed in the basement of Courtney's parents' house, and when Bleeker moved to Philadelphia, the other three continued working on music. Eventually Bleeker returned, and after playing guitar since high school, he was asked to play bass to make it easier to sing for Courtney, who had played bass throughout high school and had recently picked up guitar to write songs. Recording Most of Real Estate's debut album was recorded from January until June 2009 at Yeah Buddy HQ in Glen Rock, New Jersey, a studio operated by the band's childhood friend Sarim \\"Sam\\" Al-Rawi. \\"Suburban Dogs\\" was recorded at Courtney's mother's house, while \\"Fake Blues\\" was recorded at Courtney's apartment.

Biographie de Will , Bdparadisio.com. In 1960, Maurice Rosy, writer of Tif et Tondu and artistic director of Spirou, suggested that Denis should take over the illustrating of the strip. Interview, BDTour.com. Denis made two episodes of the series, Tif et Tondu √† Hollywood in 1960 and Ne tirez pas sur Hippocampe! in 1961. Plans to publish these stories as albums were eventually dropped, despite Denis creating a cover drawing for the first one already.

They were produced in various Pre-Columbian cultures. In Europe they were made from probably before the early Middle Ages and though many founders cast bells of this type, the Robert Wells bell foundry of Aldbourne, Wiltshire produced the largest range. The first medieval designs came in two separate halves into which a metal pea was introduced and the two halves were then soldered or crimped together. Somewhere around 1400 they were cast in a single piece with a ball of metal inside. Crotal bells, also known as rumble bells, were used on horse-drawn vehicles before motorised vehicles were common. They were often made of bronze with a slot cut down the side. These bells were used to warn other horse-drawn vehicle users (mostly on country roads) that another vehicle was approaching. They came in many sizes, from a small 1-inch version to bells that were many inches across - the older ones were forged while others were cast. They were either hung on a small leather-and-iron harness bracket above the horse's collar on smaller vehicles. On larger vehicles, such as delivery wagons, they were driven into the wooden frame of the wagon. Bronze Age crotals A different form of crotal is found in Prehistoric Ireland. The National Museum of Ireland and British Museum have several examples on display dating from the late Bronze Age (800 ‚Äì 800 BC) which were found in the Dowris Hoard, alongside various brass wind instruments. These are bronze cylinders in the rough shape of a bull's testicle, with a piece of baked clay or a pebble inside. It is presumed they functioned as a type of rattle. The hoard had 48 of them in total, in two sizes. Only two other examples are known, both Irish.Wallace, Patrick F., O'Floinn, Raghnall eds.

Life Marie Nizet was born in Brussels into a literary family. She was a student at Isabelle Gatti de Gamond's secondary girls' school (Cours d'√âducation pour jeunes filles). Her father, employed at the Royal Library of Belgium, had published patriotic poetry and works on history and librarianship. Her brother Henri was to become a journalist and novelist. Nizet developed an interest in Romania, perhaps due to the influence of √©migr√©s and students who lodged with the family. Her first poetic works were published in 1878, written during the Romanian War of Independence and before the Congress of Berlin secured Romania's independence, expressed her support for the Romanians and her opposition to Russia's attempts to dominate Romania. Her early work met with some success but her literary career was to be short, ending in 1879 when she married. Her marriage ended in acrimonious divorce and Nizet was left to raise her son alone. Following her death at Etterbeek in 1922, her son found a collection of love poems, dedicated to Nizet's late lover Cecil Axel-Veneglia, which were published the following year as Pour Axel to critical acclaim.

She was created by Hideki Kamiya, designed by Mari Shimazaki and is voiced by Hellena Taylor in English and Atsuko Tanaka in Japanese. Bayonetta is one of only two surviving Umbra Witches, being the child of a Witch and a Lumen Sage. During the first game, she goes in search of her forgotten past, heading for her old home of Vigrid and fighting the angelic forces of Paradiso on the way. She also appears as the protagonist of Bayonetta 2 and as a special guest character in other titles such as Anarchy Reigns, The Wonderful 101 and the Super Smash Bros. series. Reception of the character has been positive overall, with the common point of praise being her highly feminine image, which makes her both stand out among female characters in video games and go against several set conventions. Conception and design alt=Sketch of two long haired, black-clothed women in two poses, side by side. To their left is a cat-shaped earring. Above the woman on the right are six circular items of gold jewelry. Around them is a white background with Japanese and English text throughout Given the suggestion to create another action game by producer Yusuke Hashimoto, project director Hideki Kamiya decided to create a female lead for the title, having felt he had already done all that could be done with male protagonists. To this end, he told character designer Mari Shimazaki to create her with three traits: a female lead, a modern witch, and to use four guns. Her name was inspired by a bayonet, meant to imply there was \\"more to her than meets the eye\\", while her four guns were named parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme after the old English ballad, 'Scarborough Fair', due to Kamiya's love of folk music. The process, which took a full year, went through a hundred character designs and alterations, with early appearances resembling a traditional witch, with a frayed black outfit and a \\"veil-like look\\" on her head. The outfit color persisted, described by Shimazaki as being her \\"theme color\\" due to being a witch. She was given longer legs and arms to make her more appealing as an action-game character, countering what Shimazaki felt was a trend of female characters in such games having short and thin limbs. Her limbs and the rest of her design were appealing to Kamiya, and development proceeded on the character's attire. Bayonetta's beehive hairstyle in the first game was an aspect Shimazaki insisted on, using it as an alternative to the usual pointed hat seen on witches. However, despite concerns, Kamiya had no qualms about the hairstyle one way or another. She was additionally given glasses at Kamiya's insistence, intended to differentiate her from other female characters as well as give her a \\"sense of mystery and intelligence\\", though Shimazaki attributed it to possibly his preference for women with glasses. Her guns were modeled after a derringer pistol, in order to remain convincing and familiar, as well as to make her weapons \\"capable of rapid fire; a simple, rugged gun\\". Kamiya approved the idea, on the grounds that he felt the weapon would look \\"hot\\" in a female hand. Holsters were additionally considered for her feet, however the developers discarded the idea after feeling it wasn't feminine. The concept of creating her outfit out of her hair was intended to fit into her design as a witch, which the development team felt meant she derived power from her hair. It was designed to both be a \\"means of adornment and protection\\" while also giving her appear \\"fashionable\\" and accentuate the movement of her limbs. During this process it was decided that as she summoned creatures to attack her enemies during the game she would lose partial control of her hair and end up in more \\"comfortable\\" attire; Shimazaki noted this as one of the aspects of the character she loved. Kamiya in addition wanted to avoid giving her large breasts and cleavage, feeling that normal sized breasts were adequate and that being mysterious was more attractive than \\"baring it all\\". The character's model was created by Kenichiro Yoshimura, who observed non-Japanese models to keep her proportions authentic, giving particular focus to her backside which, as a result, led to it being made wider and more rounded than the typically slim-hipped female characters designed by Japanese artists. While the character Jeanne came to be better liked by most of the team, Bayonetta was Shimazaki's favorite character, while Kamiya referred to her as his \\"ideal woman\\". Her outfit in Bayonetta 2 was again designed by Shimazaki. It was generally designed more around straight lines than curves. All her jewelry and accessories were designed around this initiative apart from her glasses. There was debate about where to show skin, but when it was decided to create a cape at the front of the outfit, the front of her outfit was closed and instead they opted to show a large area of her back. For her new look, blue became a key color as opposed to the first game, where it was red: this was because water was a key theme for the second game and Hashimoto requested blue to become the design's key color. This eventually proved difficult as, combined with the black and silver incorporated into her outfit and the game's general color palette, it did not have the sharp qualities of her former appearance. Shimazaki described trying to make her stand out in her black outfit as \\"a nightmare\\". Her overall design theme was \\"solid\\". The character's hairstyle underwent a major redesign. Hashimoto's main reason behind this was that \\"[Bayonetta's] personality is the type that would not want to remain stagnant. She would want to change her style, taste in fashion, and her costumes. Down the line in the series, she may make further changes to her appearance.\\" The texture of her outfit was designed to appear similar to leather, despite it still being made from her hair. Her new guns, Love is Blue, were also difficult to design, as making them too large or too similar in color to other elements of Bayonetta's outfit would not have fitted her. In the end, they were made a more striking shade of blue, as well as being given some gold to match Bayonetta's chestpiece and a silver sheen. Each of the guns, Night, Jealous, Eye and Life, were given antique charms adorned with flower designs and named according to their color and the ideas they evoked to further promote and augment the new look. Portrayal Bayonetta is voiced by Hellena Taylor in English and Atsuko Tanaka in Japanese. For the original game, despite production being based in Japan, Kamiya was particular to insist that the character have an English voice actor, and had no Japanese voice actor assigned due to his belief that speaking Japanese would not suit the character. Tanaka first voiced the character in the anime Bayonetta: Bloody Fate, an adaptation of the original Bayonetta, and subsequently assumed the role in Bayonetta 2 and the re-release of the original title on Wii U. Tanaka also voiced the character in commercials for the original game in 2009. She was chosen due to the fact that her name kept cropping up when the team asked who could best portray the character in Japanese. Appearances Bayonetta series Bayonetta was born in Vigrid from the forbidden union of Lumen Sage Father Balder and Umbra Witch Rosa: the Witch was imprisoned and the Sage exiled from his clan. Bayonetta's birth caused a rift between the formally peaceful clans and eventually led to them engaging in a war. Bayonetta became a black sheep among the Umbran Witches, and during the war, Jeanne, her former childhood friend and rival, sealed her away and wiped her memory to protect her from those who would exploit her power. For the next five hundred years, Bayonetta was sealed in a coffin at the bottom of a lake. She is later rescued, at Father Balder's instructions, by a journalist, who is then murdered by Balder's angels as his son, Luka, looks on. In Bayonetta, the witch sets out for her hometown Vigrid, where Father Balder is preparing to awaken the creator Jubileus and trigger the creation of a new world at the cost of the old one. She is followed there by a now grown-up Luka, who has become a journalist and has set out to show Bayonetta to the world, as an act of vengeance for her supposed part in his father's death. She also encounters Jeanne, who is under Balder's control, and Cereza, Bayonetta's younger self sent through time by the Lumen Sage. Cereza and Bayonetta become close, with Cereza thinking Bayonetta was her mother and Bayonetta eventually telling Cereza that she should keep things she treasured close to her heart (referring specifically to a charm Cereza's mother had given her as a birthday present). Eventually, Bayonetta learns the truth of recent events after defeating Balder and sending Cereza back to her own era: the \\"Left Eye\\" is actually Bayonetta herself, and regaining her memories allowed her to awaken her latent power. By bringing Cereza into the present, Balder set events into motion that would prevent Bayonetta from forgetting her past when Jeanne sealed her away. Knocked unconscious by the awakening of her power, Bayonetta is sealed within Jubileus by Balder, only to be rescued by Jeanne, newly freed from the Lumen Sage's control. Together, the two destroy Jubileus and save the planet. In Bayonetta 2, a few months after the events of the first game, Bayonetta and Jeanne are fighting an angel outbreak when a supernatural summoning goes wrong and Gomarrah kills Jeanne. Bayonetta then sets out to rescue Jeanne's soul from a realm called Hell, heading to the sacred mountain Fimbulvintr to find the doorway to Inferno. Arriving at the town of Noatun, she encounters a mysterious boy named Loki who serves as her guide to the mountain. She also reunites with Luka, who tells her about the legend of the deity Aesir, who created and ruled the human realm. During their journey, the pair is attacked by a masked Lumen Sage who targets Loki. When they reach the Gates of Hell, Bayonetta meets Loptr, who is apparently working with the Masked Lumen and knows Loki very well. Through a vision, he reveals to her that her father Balder was not responsible for the witch hunts and tried to save her mother, who was killed by an unknown assailant who looks like Loki. To escape their attackers, Bayonetta and Loki flee into Hell, but the Masked Lumen follows them. Separated from the boy, Bayonetta fights through hordes of demons and successfully rescues Jeanne but finds Loki being attacked again by the Masked Lumen. Intervening, Bayonetta fights the Sage, revealed to be a younger version of her father Balder who had been targeting Loki for Rosa's murder. Suddenly, Loki unwillingly sends both Bayonetta and Balder back into the past during the Witch Hunts. Bayonetta meets her mother Rosa, and the two of them fight against the angels. During the battle, she fights a younger version of Loptr, and she realizes that he murdered Rosa and framed Loki for the crime. Later encountering Balder, the pair enter the Umbra Witch sanctuary to find that Loptr had killed Rosa. When he escapes, Bayonetta tells Balder that the killer was not Loki. She then opens a time portal and the two of them return to the present. With the help of Jeanne flying a fighter jet, Bayonetta and Balder set out for Fimbulvientr to confront Loptr, who has captured Loki. He reveals that he and Loki are the two halves of Aesir. When Aesir divided his power into the Eyes of the World, he split his soul into two: Loki being the good half and Loptr being the evil half. But Loptr decided to take back his power and become Aesir once again. Draining Loki of his power, Loptr takes the Eyes from both Bayonetta and Balder and transforms into Aesir. While the Witch and the Sage team up to fight Aesir, Loki erases the Eyes and weaken Loptr. Bayonetta and Balder defeat Loptr and split his soul from his body. When he tries to escape into the past to be reborn, Balder stops him by sealing the soul inside his body, despite Loki warning that it will corrupt him. Bayonetta tearfully bids farewell to her father as he is transported back into the past and becomes the corrupted Father Balder. As Loki begins to fade, he promises to Bayonetta that they will meet again when he is reborn. Other appearances Penny Drake dressed as the character at E3 2009 At the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Sega chose Penny Drake to model as Bayonetta after auditioning 100 women. To promote the character and the game, Playboy featured several models dressed as her for viewers to vote which they considered the best. Sega also joined men's lifestyle website Maxim.com to run a contest to find women who looked like Bayonetta; the grand prize winner was Andrea Bonaccorso. A Spanish cosplayer known as \\"Judy Helsing\\" portrayed Bayonetta as she appeared in Bayonetta 2 for Playboy. Bayonetta starred in the anime film Bayonetta: Bloody Fate, an adaptation of the first Bayonetta game. She also appears as a downloadable character in Sega's multiplayer fighting game Anarchy Reigns, and as a special guest character alongside Jeanne and Rodin in Nintendo's action game The Wonderful 101. On December 15, 2015, Bayonetta was announced as the final downloadable character for Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Following a Nintendo-sponsored fan poll asking for character suggestions for the game, Bayonetta was the most popular choice among \\"negotiable\\" characters worldwide, placing among the top five vote-getters in the United States and placing first in the polls in Europe. She sports her primary character designs from both Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2 with her design from the second game being her default appearance, and retains many of her abilities from both games, such as extended combos, Witch Time, and Infernal Climax. She was released alongside a stage based on the falling Umbra Clock Tower from Bayonetta on February 3, 2016 in North America and on February 4, 2016 in Europe. Both the character and stage return in the sequel Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, this time in the initial release. Hideki Kamiya was approached about having Bayonetta included in Project X Zone 2, to which he refused as he wanted Bayonetta and Dante from Devil May Cry to meet \\"on his own terms\\". However, he has stated that he has come to regret this decision due to realizing how the fans would have loved the two interacting, and that if there is a Project X Zone 3 he would be all for Bayonetta's inclusion. Bayonetta also appears in 8-Bit Bayonetta, a free game that SEGA released on 1 April 2017 on Steam. The game's achievements led players to a \\"coming soon\\" page, with a countdown that ended with the release of the first game on PC. Reception Critical response to Bayonetta's character has been mainly positive. Computer and Video Games praised her as more interesting than the game's storyline, describing her as the \\"sexiest collection of pixels [they've] ever seen\\", though not a character they considered a sex object. They further compared her to \\"Lara Croft without the prudishness, Rubi from Wet played with honest sexuality\\", and one of the most memorable characters they'd seen. GamesRadar stated the character deserved plenty of respect, describing her as \\"sexy, witty and can certainly handle herself in a fight\\" and further named her one of the game's most positive points as she \\"kicks all sorts of ass and is funny too.\\" GamePro felt that the character's \\"overt sexuality and frantic anime-inspired shenanigans\\" hampered the game's presentation, adding they would have enjoyed the character more if less focus had been put on her sexuality. IGN's Ryan Clements described the character as a \\"hardcore badass\\" that was also \\"brimming with sexual energy\\", further describing her as an \\"immensely powerful protagonist\\". However, associate editor Nicole Tanner disagreed, noting she did not find the character's sexuality at all empowering as \\"just because you give a girl an attitude and guns isn't enough to offset what she looks like\\". Other members of IGN's staff named her their favorite video game character, describing her as \\"the playfulness and versatility of Dante\\" combined with \\"visually inventive combat\\". They cited her constant nudity as a point of appeal, calling the mechanic of her hair serving as her clothing both one of the stupidest and one of the coolest elements of a character. In 2012, the staff of GamesRadar ranked her as the 100th best hero in video games. The same site later listed her as the 17th best character from her generation. Larry Hester of Complex ranked her as the 19th hottest video game character in 2012, and as the 20th \\"most badass\\" video game character of all time in 2013. Lisa Foiles of The Escapist named Bayonetta's boots as the craziest footwear in video games, saying she was \\"totally okay with the absurdity of these.\\" In 2014, La Nueva Espa√±a included the \\"as beautiful as lethal\\" Bayonetta among the top ten sexiest video game characters of both genders. Thanh Ni√™n ranked her in 2015 as the 18th most sexy female character. Upon the release of Bayonetta 2 in 2014, Bayonetta's design received both widespread approval but also criticism from some reviewers. Polygon's Arthur Gies praised the developers for giving Bayonetta \\"some much-needed development as a human being who cares about things other than herself; her motivations go beyond the agonizingly trope-y amnesia setup of the first game\\", he was significantly concerned about other aspects of her depiction, such as gratuitous camera angles that were \\"frequently provided as an implicit reward for doing well. ‚Ä¶ It's sexist, gross pandering, and it's totally unnecessary.\\" He felt that such issues \\"cause[d] an otherwise great game to require a much bigger mental compromise to enjoy\\". Edge stated that although \\"Bayonetta's default design shows how to walk the tightrope between sexy and sexualised\\", certain optional costumes \\"range from the respectable to the cringeworthy.\\" GameSpot review by Mark Walton found the character praiseworthy: \\"[D]espite suffering crotch shots and blatant innuendos ‚Ä¶[Bayonetta] remains one of the most charismatic and powerful heroines in the medium. There are none of the sleazy moments that peppered the likes of Lollipop Chainsaw and Killer Is Dead; the sexualisation here serves to empower, not to belittle.\\" In an editorial for The Guardian on female characterization, Ria Jenkins praised Bayonetta as a character who is \\"unapologetically feminine, sexual and confident. Dismissed by many as an objectified fantasy, she is a woman without compromise who refuses to be ashamed of her body.\\" In 2018, Lady Gaga expressed her love of the character, referring to her as \\"tough.\\" In 2020, Lady Gaga released a music video for \\"Rain On Me\\" containing several references to Bayonetta.

Having landed there, he ravaged the country, and, blockading the city by sea and land, reduced the Corcyraeans to the greatest extremities. Imagining, however, that success was now within his grasp, he dismissed some of his mercenaries and kept the pay of the rest in arrear. It would appear, too, that discipline was less strictly preserved among his men than heretofore ; for we read that- the several posts of the besiegers were now imperfectly guarded, and that their soldiers were dispersed in straggling parties throughout the country. The Corcyraeans, observing this, made a sally, in which they slew some, and made some prisoners. Mnasippus proceeded in haste against them, ordering his officers to lead out the mercenaries ; and, when they represented to him that they could not answer for the obedience of the men while they remained unpaid, he met their remonstrances with blows ‚Äî an exhibition of coarse arrogance by no means uncommon with Spartans in power. It may well be conceived that the spirit which animated his troops was not one of alacrity or of attachment to his person. In the battle which ensued close to the gates of the town, the Corcyraeans were victorious and Mnasippus was slain. According to Diodorus, these successful operations were conducted under the command of Ctesicles (doubtless the Stesicles of Xenophon), whom the Athenians had sent to the aid of Corcyra with a body of 500 or 600 targeteers.(Xen.

The theatre has two auditoria, and is led by Tracey Childs (Executive Producer and Joint Chief Executive), Steve Mannix (Executive Director and Joint Chief Executive) and Ryan McBryde (Creative Director). The theatre also contains The Digby Gallery, which showcases local art. History In 1968, the Colchester New Theatre Trust was formed to identify a site for a new theatre and to oversee its constructions. The Mercury Theatre, designed by Norman Downie, was opened on 10 May 1972, after a successful fund-raising campaign, supported by a large grant from the Borough Council. It originated with the Colchester Repertory Company, formed in 1937. The theatre was initially structurally identical to the Salisbury Playhouse, though the Playhouse was later extended. David Buxton, the first Artistic Director, was succeeded by Michael Winter in 1984. After David Forder's retirement as Administrative Director in late 1990, Michael became Artistic Director and Chief Executive. In May 1994, Pat Trueman succeeded him in the joint role, until 1998. Adrian Stokes joined as Associate Director in 1995 and initiated the Community Education Programme. In 1998 Dee Evans arrived as Chief Executive and Gregory Floy as Artistic Producer. Together, in 1999, they formed the Mercury Theatre Company with Gregory as Artistic Director. In 2012 the Company was superseded by Made in Colchester, introduced by newly appointed Artistic Director Daniel Buckroyd and Executive Director Theresa Veith. In 2019 a revamped leadership structure was announced with Tracey Childs (Executive Producer) and Steve Mannix (Executive Director) appointed as Joint Chief Executives and Ryan McBryde appointed as Creative Director.  Featured artists  Productions at the Mercury have included the work of John Cleese, Martin Clunes, Gwen Taylor, Simon Gray, Toby Longworth, Ingrid Lacey, Michael Grandage, Mike Poulton, Michael Deacon, Colin McCormack, David Oakes, Donald Freed Michael Grandage made his directorial debut at the Mercury with \\"The Last Yankee\\", and Trevor Howard began his career at the Colchester Repertory Company.

A more effective armament of 60 ships, with Timotheus for commander, was to follow as soon as it could be got ready. Meanwhile, Stesicles, with the assistance of Alcetas I of Epirus, effected an entrance into the town under cover of night. Here he reconciled the dissensions of the democratic party, united them against the common enemy, and conducted that series of successful operations, which ended in the defeat and death of Mnasippus, and the withdrawal of the Spartan fleet even before the arrival of Iphicrates, who had superseded Timotheus . There can be no question as to the identity of the Stesicles of Xenophon with the Ctesicles of Diodorus. But the latter writer tells us that Ctesicles had been sent sometime before to Zacynthus, to take the command against the Spartans of the Zacynthian exiles, whom Timotheus had restored. Johann Gottlob Schneider would reconcile the two authors by supposing that he was ordered to proceed from Zacynthus to Corcyra, nor does this seem so inconsistent with the language of Xenophon as Connop Thirlwall and Carl Rehdantz represent it.(Xen.

History During the sixteenth and seventeenth century, a significantly large number of Goan Catholics, migrated to Canara due to a variety of reasons. The arrival of the Christians, particularly from Goa to the Canara was neither completely voluntary nor completely peaceful. The migration was the result of religious, political, economic, cultural, social and other causes. Padvals were the local Catholic converts of South Canara and did not mix with the Christian immigrants from Goa. Catholic historian Severine Silva in his The Marriage Customs of the Christians in South Canara, India (1965), speculates that the Padvals in the Christian community were Jain converts. Their descendants constitute a minor caste among the Mangalorean Catholics of Dakshina Kannada. According to Mangalorean genealogist Michael Lobo, the major Padval clans are the Rodrigues family of Ambepol, Bantwal, Bejai, Nod and Kadri; Tauro family of Bantwal, Kodialbail and Kankanadi; Lobo family of Bellore, Derebail and Mermajal; and D'Souza family of Bejai, Kadri and Vamanjoor.

He is most famous as the founder of TDI, and as the one time holder of the world record for deep diving on air.\\"Fifty Fathoms: History of Diving\\" 2014 He is also one of diving's most popular writers. Gilliam is a multimillionaire from the sale of several businesses that included Technical Diving International (TDI), V. I. Divers Ltd., AMF Yacht Charters, Ocean Quest Cruise Lines, G2 Publishing (Fathoms Magazine), Sea Ventures Ltd., and Uwatec. Several of his companies grew into multi-national conglomerates and two were taken public in major sales while others were sold to private investment groups. Gilliam formed the consulting service Ocean Tech in 1971 and currently provides expert witness testimony for diving and maritime related legal cases. Since 1973, he has appeared in over 350 cases, nearly exactly evenly divided between defense and plaintiff litigation. (A recent case in which he appeared as the maritime and diving expert witness for the plaintiffs resulted in a $12 million settlement in May 2015.KeysNews.com May 20, 2015) Gilliam has also testified in criminal trials and been Congressionally appointed to military court martial proceedings for the U.S. Marine Corps. Special Consultant in various capacities for the U. S. Navy, U. S. Coast Guard (USCG), Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Background Bret Gilliam was born February 3, 1951 at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland to Commander Gill Gilliam (retired as Captain) and Jeanne Gilliam. He was the first of three children. His younger brother Chris was murdered in 1972 at the age of 16 while attending an outdoor concert in Puerto Rico. Education In 1959, the YMCA developed the first nationally organized course and certified their first skin and scuba diving instructors, and Gilliam began his diving training with Lt. Chuck Brestle while his family was stationed at the Naval Air Station Key West that same year. From 1965 to 1967 he attended Virginia Beach High School until the school system split students to attend the newly created First Colonial High School. He remained at First Colonial High School until 1967 when his father was transferred to Brunswick Naval Air Station as Senior Executive Officer. He graduated from Brunswick High School in Brunswick, Maine in 1969. While in high school, he was a stand-out athlete playing football, ice hockey, and baseball while also swimming and running track. He also was sponsored as a surfing competitor for Hobie and Hansen surfboards and participated in contest events on the east and west coasts (and Caribbean) as well as promotional sales activities for those manufacturers from 1965 to 1970. Gilliam then went on to attend the University of Maine and Bowdoin College where he studied history and political science. He won a National ROTC Scholarship in 1968 and was scheduled to be commissioned as an Army officer when he was recruited to do alternate service on a Navy deep diving project filming nuclear fast attack submarines. Gilliam left his undergraduate studies early to join the Navy project and then went on to pursue a business career by starting Ocean Tech. Career Gilliam held several diving jobs and competed as a semi- professional surfer while in high school and college. In 1971, Gilliam was a diving Supervisor for Vocaline Air Sea Technology (VAST Inc.). The VAST Inc. contract took him to the Caribbean where he worked to develop nitrox and decompression procedures for their dive teams. It was here that Gilliam's interest in underwater photography began. Their work was to record the \\"visible wake vortex that came off the propeller\\" of submarines. In 1972 off the island of St. Croix, Gilliam's dive buddy Rod Temple was attacked by oceanic whitetip sharks during a project and was killed. Gilliam was cited for heroism by the Virgins Islands' Governor for his attempt to save Temple when he broke off his decompression and swam back into the attack. Both divers were dragged to depths in excess of 350 feet during the struggle before Temple was torn from Gilliam's grasp. Gilliam survived an out-of-air free ascent from extreme depth and had to be evacuated to Puerto Rico to be treated for decompression sickness. That same year, he also created his consulting company Ocean Tech in the U.S. Virgin Islands. V.I. Divers Ltd. was founded by Gilliam in 1973 in St. Croix as a dive resort that not only catered to recreational divers but also scientific divers. The company (and others that followed) also had a filming and studio support division that provided location services for boats, diving, equipment, helicopter & aircraft, stunt persons, and local logistics for Hollywood movies, television series, documentaries, and tourism promotions. Film work from 1971 to the present included movies such as \\"Pleasure Island\\", \\"The Deep\\", \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\", \\"The Man Without A Face\\", \\"Dreams of Gold\\", \\"Going Overboard\\", \\"The Island\\", \\"Having A Ball\\", \\"Abyss\\", \\"The Dive\\", \\"Message In A Bottle\\", \\"Head Above Water\\", as well as television productions such as \\"Miami Vice\\", \\"Greatest American Hero\\", \\"ABC Sports\\", \\"Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\\", \\"HBO\\", \\"Showtime\\", \\"Discovery Channel\\", \\"National Geographic Explorer\\", \\"Travel Channel\\", \\"Cinemax\\", \\"Today\\", \\"NBC's live broadcasts of the 1983 America's Cup Races\\", \\"Encore Productions\\", \\"BBC\\", and \\"The Playboy Channel\\". In 1977, Gilliam served as the founder and president of AMF Yacht Charters Ltd. providing luxury motor yacht charters on vessels up to 380 feet in length. Both companies were sold in 1985 and after a short break, Gilliam resumed his work with the formation of cruise ship lines as the Vice President, chief executive officer (CEO) and Director of Ship Operations for Ocean Quest International in 1988. He served as Senior officer aboard their 550-ft., 28,000 ton flagship Ocean Spirit. This was the world's largest sport diving operation in history. Gilliam also began conducting research on dive computer safety during this time and remained with Ocean Quest until the company was sold to Sea Escape Cruise Lines in the fall of 1990. Gilliam performed a deep air dive on February 14, 1990 at a site named \\"Mary's Place\\" in Roat√°n to . Gilliam later reached in October 1993 to better his own record.

International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers In 1991, Gilliam joined Dick Rutkowski, Tom Mount and Billy Deans on the board of directors for International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers (IANTD). During this time, Gilliam also served as the vice-president of the company. Gilliam co-authored two books over this time period in addition to his work on the training materials used in IANTD courses. He remained in this position with IANTD until 1994 when he separated and formed the training agency Technical Diving International (TDI) as part of the corporation International Training Inc. TDI quickly grew to be the largest technical training agency in the world with offices in 26 countries. International Training Inc International Training Inc. is the parent company for Technical Diving International (TDI), Scuba Diving International (SDI), and Emergency Response Diving International (ERDI), diving certification agencies originally headquartered in Topsham, Maine. TDI was founded in 1994 by Bret Gilliam and several other minority shareholders after a disagreement between IANTD directors caused Gilliam to sell his stock and split away to form the agency. Gilliam remained President and Chief Executive Officer of International Training Inc until February 5, 2004 when it was sold to investors backing Brian Carney who had been serving as the General Manager. The company is now located in Florida. Uwatec Gilliam took over as vice- president and CEO of UWATEC USA in 1996. Gilliam assisted UWATEC's founder and owner, Heinz Ruchti, with the sale of the company to Johnson Outdoors the following year.

Career Following studies in music and French literature (Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Columbia College (B.A.), and Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (M.A.), Schechter then completed his medical training at the Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons. His earliest research examined the nature of mother- daughter relationships in the context of male-perpetrated child sexual abuse Schechter DS, Brunelli SA, Cunningham N, Brown J, Baca P (2002).

Funding through the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, allowed Schechter to travel to Tulane University in New Orleans, beginning in 1998, to study with infant mental health specialist Charles H. Zeanah. They have since collaborated on multiple projects and articles related to the effects of psychological trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the relationship of infants, young children, and their parents as well as related attachment disorder.Schechter DS, Zeanah CH, Myers MM, Brunelli SA, Liebowitz MR, Marshall RD, Coates SW, Trabka KT, Baca P, Hofer MA (2004).

Handbook of Infant Mental Health‚Äî3rd Edition. New York: Guilford Press, Inc., pp. 197-213. This collaboration along with involvement as a Zero to Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families Solnit Fellow (1999‚Äì2001), encouraged Schechter to pursue further research training in developmental neuroscience through a NIH-funded research fellowship in developmental psychobiology with Myron Hofer and Michael Myers at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. In 2003, Schechter received an NIMH Research Career Award to fund the project \\"Maternal Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Interactive Behavior with Very Young Children\\" which was completed in 2008. In that same year, Schechter was recruited to Geneva, Switzerland to become the Director of Pediatric Consult-Liaison and Parent-Child Research in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Geneva Hospitals. And he is currently Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry within the Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva. In Geneva, his clinical research efforts continue to focus on the effects of parental violence-related traumatic stress on the parent-child relationship and child developmental outcomes in the domains of emotion and arousal regulation, together with related biomarkers, that might contribute to intergenerational cycles of violence and victimization. Schechter, D., Rusconi Serpa, S (2011). Applying relevant developmental neuroscience towards interventions that better target intergenerational transmission of violent trauma. The Signal: Newsletter of the World Association of Infant Mental Health, 19(3), 9-16. Schechter was appointed in 2018 as Barakett Associate Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine where he served as Director of the research Center for Stress, Trauma, and Resilience and Medical Director of Perinatal and Early Childhood Mental Health Services. In July, 2019, he returned to Switzerland to assume medical directorship of a new ambulatory care and research program for children ages 0 to 5 years on the child and adolescent psychiatry service of the Lausanne University Hospital. Schechter's work has received a number of awards including: Pierre Janet and Sandor Ferenczi Scientific Paper Prizes from the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (2007 and 2018 respectively), the Hayman Prize for Best Published Work Relevant to Traumatized Children or Adults (2015) and four Significant Contribution to Research Awards from the International Psychoanalytical Association (2005, 2009, 2013, 2015), as well as three Norbert and Charlotte Rieger Paper Prizes from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2010, 2015, 2017). His publication with psychologist Dominik Moser on neural activity among traumatized mothers with dissociative symptoms was awarded a Best Scientific Paper Prize by the French Psychiatric Association (2014).

Comorbid dissociation dampens limbic activation in violence-exposed mothers with PTSD who are exposed to video-clips of their child during separation. Stress. 16(5):493-502. Helping traumatized parents \\"change their minds about their young children\\" During his work as director of infant mental health services at the Columbia University Medical Center (1998‚Äì2008), Schechter found that the large majority of inner-city mothers who were requesting consultation for their infants and young children for reasons of behavioral difficulties had histories of childhood maltreatment and/or family violence victimization and exposure, often with related psychiatric sequelae (i.e. PTSD, major depression, dissociation, and personality disorder). He further observed that many of these traumatized mothers, despite their best intentions, not only had great difficulty in \\"reading\\" and tolerating their infants' distress, but that they also had a tendency to misattribute their children's intentions and personality characteristics.Schechter DS, Coots T, Zeanah CH, Davies, M, Coates SW, Trabka KA, Marshall RD, Liebowitz MR, Myers MM (2005).

Infant Mental Health Journal. 24(5), 510-28. As a result, the child, in an effort to maintain an attachment with the traumatized parent, would conform to these misattributions and/or attempt to join the parent's hypervigilant mental state, leading to a traumatically skewed intersubjectivitySchechter DS, Zygmunt A, Coates SW, Davies M, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Kolodji A., Robinson JL (2007). Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children‚Äôs mental representations of self and others. Attachment & Human Development, 9(3), 187-20. Children of these traumatized mothers also show increased PTSD symptoms, externalizing symptoms and attachment disturbances that are mediated by maternal PTSD severity.Schechter DS, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH (2011).

Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Issue. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics of North America, 18(3), 665-687. Schechter and colleagues developed an experimental paradigm informed by attachment theory called the Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions (CAVES) to test whether mothers could \\"change their mind\\" about their young children if helped to watch video-excerpts of play, separation and similarly stressful moments in the presence of a clinician who asks the mother to think about what she (and her child) might be thinking and feeling at the time of the excerpt and at the moment of videofeedback. Thus this technique applies principles of mentalization as an aide to emotional regulation with traumatized parentsFonagy, P., Gergely, G., Jurist, E.L., Target, M. (2002).

Schechter and colleagues showed a significant change in the way mothers perceived their own child and their relationship together.Schechter DS, Myers MM, Brunelli SA, Coates SW, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Grienenberger JF, Marshall RD, McCaw JE, Trabka KA, Liebowitz MR (2006). Traumatized mothers can change their minds about their toddlers: Understanding how a novel use of videofeedback supports positive change of maternal attributions. Infant Mental Health Journal, 27(5), 429-448. Schechter, Rusconi Serpa, and colleagues have manualized a 16-session psychotherapy for violence- exposed mothers, their infants and young children that builds upon the CAVES technique. This treatment is called Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure- Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) and currently is in a pilot phase. Intergenerational communication of violent trauma Schechter has studied how the distressed toddler can trigger a parent's posttraumatic stress marked by a) emotional unavailability or frank avoidance and b) how parents communicate‚Äî often unintentionally, memories of their own violent traumatic experiences. In relation to emotional unavailability, Schechter and colleagues' found that mothers with interpersonal-violence related PTSD, while not showing differences in their capacity to jointly attend to play with their toddlers before a stressor when compared to control-subjects, show significant limitation in their responsiveness to their toddlers upon reunion following separation stress. This is despite the finding that children of PTSD mothers show no greater distress during separation than those of controls.Schechter DS, Willheim E, Hinojosa C, Scholfield-Kleinman K, Turner JB, McCaw J, Zeanah CH, Myers MM. (2010). Subjective and objective measures of parent-child relationship dysfunction, child separation distress, and joint attention. Psychiatry;73(2):130-44. And in relation to communication of traumatic experience, following from the work of Scheeringa and Zeanah, Schechter explored the implicit and explicit non-verbal and verbal ways parents communicate their traumatic experiences to their children who may or may not have been present during these violent events.Scheeringa, M.S., Zeanah, C.H. (2001). A relational perspective on PTSD in early childhood. Journal of Traumatic Stress, 14(4), 799-815 In particular, Schechter has shown how a parent can vicariously and unintentionally transmit her prior experiences of interpersonal violence to her child through her behavior and narrative associations by doing or saying something‚Äî or drawing connections between actions and/or language, that the child cannot place in any familiar context, but that is by its nature, frightening or even traumatizing. His work has demonstrated this both in routine daily interactions, laboratory observations, and in violent-media viewing practices by mothers and their toddlers in the home.Schechter DS, Coots T, Zeanah CH, Davies, M, Coates SW, Trabka KA, Marshall RD, Liebowitz MR, Myers MM (2005).

Fits and starts: A mother-infant case study involving pseudoseizures across three generations in the context of violent trauma history.Schechter DS, Gross A, Willheim E, McCaw J, Turner JB, Myers MM, Zeanah CH, Gleason MM (2009). Is maternal PTSD associated with greater exposure of very young children to violent media? Journal of Traumatic Stress. 22(6), 658-662. He has hypothesized that this inadvertent intergenerational transmission is often an effect of traumatized mothers' efforts to control their own psychophysiological dysregulation that is linked to their posttraumatic psychopathology. This was, for example, demonstrated with regards to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the first publication on maternal physiologic response to child separation, and in a parallel study subsequently, in relation to the autonomic nervous system response.Schechter DS, Zeanah CH, Myers MM, Brunelli SA, Liebowitz MR, Marshall RD, Coates SW, Trabka KT, Baca P, Hofer MA (2004). Psychobiological dysregulation in violence-exposed mothers: Salivary cortisol of mothers with very young children pre- and post-separation stress. Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic, 68(4), 319-337.Schechter DS, Moser DA, McCaw JE, Myers MM (in press; epub 11.06.2013). Autonomic functioning in mothers with interpersonal violence- exposure related posttraumatic stress disorder in response to the stressor of separation-reunion. Developmental Psychobiology.56(4):748-60. Schechter and colleagues have in addition to maternal behavioral and physiological dysregulation, also found at the level of maternal brain activity, corticolimbic dysregulation on functional neuroimaging as associated with maternal PTSD and dissociative symptoms in response to child separation and adult male-female violence-related video-stimuli in both New York and Geneva samples The same pattern of corticolimbic dysregulation has also been associated with increased parenting stress, HPA axis dysregulation as marked by decreased methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, and observed child behavioral difficulty during mother-child play. An important motivation for traumatized parents, Schechter and colleagues have found is the conscious aim of the traumatized parent to interrupt intergenerational cycles of violence and trauma so that her child does not have to suffer the emotional and often physical pain that she had experienced as a child. As Schechter and Willheim describe, this can be a long and difficult process for families‚Äîand one that requires that the therapist be prepared to intervene thoughtfully (i.e. modeling and stimulating parental mentalization) as much in-the-moment in response to real-life events reported by the parents and professionals (i.e. pediatricians, daycare and preschool staff, child protective agencies, the courts) as during parent-child sessions. The work with parents and their relationship with their child often needs to continue, when possible and feasible.Almeida A, Merminod G, Schechter DS (2009). Mothers with severe psychiatric illness and their newborns: a hospital-based model of perinatal consultation. Journal of ZERO-TO-THREE: National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families, 29(5), 40-46. As infants and young children and their needs are so rapidly developing, and as their parents find themselves in a parallel phase of adult development during which they are more open to change, the therapist can be surprised by quick, positive shifts in relational patterns within the context of both brief consultations and long-term treatments such as for caregivers with complex PTSD and their young children. Infant and early childhood mental health advocacy Schechter served as a key member of the New York City Early Childhood Mental Health Strategic Work Group, an advisory group to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene under the direction of Evelyn Blanck from 2004 to 2008. In 2005, the Workgroup published a White Paper,‚ÄúPromoting the Mental Health and Healthy Development of New York‚Äôs Infants, Toddlers and Preschoolers, A Call to Action,‚Äù that has been used to effectively advocate for mental health services for children from birth to age 5 across all child-serving systems in New York City and New York State.http://www.docsfortots.org/documents/NYCMentalHCalltoAction.doc This paper was instrumental in the inclusion of infants and toddlers in the Child and Families Clinic Plus Initiative implemented by the New York State Office of Mental Health, thus officially recognized for the first time as under the responsibility for care by state licensed child and adolescent mental health clinical programs.http://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/clinicplus/ An updated version of the White Paper was reviewed favorably in 2011 by the New York State Mental Health Commissioner's Office.

He was born in V√§nersborg, in Sweden. Eriksson went to South West Africa in 1866 (before Germany had established its colony of German South West Africa in 1884) to serve out a three-year apprenticeship to Charles John Andersson. In 1871, with Swede Anders Ohlsson, he established a brewery at Omaruru. Eriksson established a trading post there, which flourished and by 1878 employed about forty whites. Eriksson's business was based upon long- distance trading between southern Angola and Cape Colony, which necessitated the establishment of regional trade routes. He also built up an extensive bird collection, specimens coming from South West Africa, Angola and the Transvaal (now Gauteng Province in South Africa), the bulk of which has since been donated to the municipal museum in V√§nersborg. His activities gained much respect from a wide range of communities, including native and Boer, over a large geographic area. He was known to the Herero as Karuwapa Katiti (\\"the small white person\\"). Axel Eriksson's graveAxel Eriksson died on 5 May 1901 at farm Urupupa. It was said that \\"when Karuwapa died, the goodness in the country died as well\\". His grave near Rietfontein, thirty kilometres south west of Grootfontein, was made a national monument in 1978; a sign beside the grave reads: \\"This is the last resting place of Axel Eriksson, well known traveller, hunter, trader and pioneer, through whose intercession the Cape Government sent food to the distressed thirstland trekkers in 1879 thus rescuing various families from certain death\\". Despite the grave's status, the site is virtually inaccessible and is not maintained, with its boundary fence no longer intact (as at October 2014). However, in 2019 visits of the National Namibian Heritage Council took place and first steps to re-establish access and the National Heritage site had been taken. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, a planned visit of a delegation of Swedish and Namibian government representatives and private Swedish interested parties had to be postponed to 2021. Eriksson married Frances \\"Fanny\\" Stewardson, in 1871 and the couple had two sons, Axel Eriksson (1871-1924, died at Gaideb, Warmbad), a noted painter and Andrew Albert Eriksson (1876-1955) who became a priest in Sweden. There was also a daughter, Maud Alice Eriksson (who married in Cape Town and moved to England). Eriksson's two brothers, Carl and Gustav also migrated to South West Africa. Eriksson divorced Frances and subsequently married a Herero princess. The couple had a son, Jacob (born around 1884), who became a farmer in what is now Mozambique (his fate is not known).

It was recorded by Adam Arrigo himself while still in college, with the help of Matt Levitt (violin/string arrangements) and contributions from various guest musicians. Background Arrigo and Levitt had been collaborating for over three years, and with a successful first recording of \\"Admit One\\" they began to produce their debut record. With the help of local producers and musicians, Arrigo began producing Simmer In Your Hotseat over the summer of 2004, drawing on material spanning two years. While working on the album, Arrigo was employed full-time at a local mental hospital in Lynn, MA, where he ran exercise and music groups for schizophrenics, head injury patients, etc. The album title was taken from an exercise tape, Sittercise, which Arrigo used in his morning groups. The tape professed activities such as: \\"Ride your bicycle and milk that cow!\\" But there was one command that no one seemed to understand: \\"There's hot oil on your seat...simmer! Simmer in your hot seat!\\" This command thrust the room into mass confusion, and the tape insisted on returning to it: \\"Alright, you're done riding that donkey? Let's simmer again!\\" While the origin of this title is quite ridiculous, it reflects the album's recurring themes of different types of debilitation.The Main Drag on Endless Recordings Endless Recordings, The Main Drag's label at the time, arranged for the band to open for Arcade Fire in November, 2004.

It is near the village of Jaji, Nigeria, about 35 km northeast of Kaduna in the Igabi Local Government Area (LGA) of Kaduna State, Nigeria. It is currently headed by Air Vice Marshal A. S Liman. History The Armed Forces Command and Staff College opened at Jaji in May 1976, giving two senior officers' courses. In April 1978, the College was expanded when the Army Junior Division was established to conduct courses for Captains in the Nigerian Army. A Demonstration Battalion, the Army School of Artillery, and armor support from a composite armored battalion in Kaduna were also located at Jaji. In September 1978, with the opening of the air faculty, Jaji was redesignated the Command and Staff College. The Navy Faculty was established in September 1981, assembling all senior military divisions in one campus. By 1986, 1,172 officers had graduated from Jaji's senior divisions, and 1,320 from the junior divisions. The original senior officers' courses were based on a curriculum derived from that of the British Army Staff College, Camberley, and the college establishment was assisted by an advisory team from the British Army. The successor to the advisory team, the Joint Warfare Advisory Team, remained until October 1988. In September 2005, United Kingdom Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram visited Jaji and announced that an extra 200,000 UK pounds would be allocated to assist training of over 17,000 Nigerian troops as peacekeepers in Africa. In November 2006, the Prince of Wales of the United Kingdom visited Nigeria and inspected soldiers at Jaji. Courses and facilities In order to achieve its mission, the College runs 3 Courses, namely: * Senior Course for Majors and their equivalent, * Junior Course for Captains and their equivalent, and * Staff Duties Course for Senior NCOs (Non Commissioned Officers) of the 3 Services. The Senior Divisions of the Land, Maritime and Air Warfare Departments conduct a one - year joint course per academic year for the officers of the rank of major or its equivalent. The Junior Courses of the 3 departments conduct two 20 - week courses for officers of the rank of captain in the Army or its equivalent in each academic year. Successful students are awarded Pass Staff Course (psc) and Pass Junior Staff Course (pjsc) at the end of the Senior and Junior Courses respectively.

Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan was born in Mahilpur, Hoshiarpur District, Punjab in the British Indian Empire on 28 June 1880. He was the eldest of four brothers. He had a strict upbringing and that he grow up to become an educated professional. Between 1896 and 1900, Khan studied at The Thomason College of Civil Engineering in Roorkee and was awarded a degree in civil engineering. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan was an expert equestrian and used to ride regularly, on occasions up to 40‚Äì50 kilometres a day. He was also a photography enthusiast and had accumulated a vast collection of cameras and used to develop his own photographs.Azam, K.M., Hayat-e-Sadeed: Bani-e-Dar ul Islam Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan (A Righteous Life: Founder of Dar ul Islam Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan), Lahore: Nashriyat, 2010 (583 pp., Urdu)  Career  After graduating in 1900, Khan joined the British Indian Government and served in the Public Works Department, the Mines Department and the Irrigation Department as Sub- Divisional Officer (SDO). He was able to save much of his salary, which he invested in agricultural landholdings in Jamalpur. While serving in the Public Works Department in 1901, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan oversaw the designing and construction of the 80 km long Pathankot-Dalhousie Road. While serving in the Mines Department, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan designed the tunnel layout inside the Khewra Salt Mines, the world's second largest salt mines. While serving in the Irrigation Department, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan worked on the 3-Canal Anhar- Salasa Irrigation project near Dipalpur in the Punjab. Earlier, while posted near the tribal areas in the North-West Frontier Province, a dam breached and Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, being the Sub-Divisional Officer, was tasked with overseeing the repair of the breach. While the repair work was being carried out, a band of tribals started firing on the engineers and labourers working on the repair of the dam from the hills surrounding the dam. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, picked up his rifle, and, along with a couple of labourers, went up to the tribals and asked them to stop the firing and explained to them that the dam project was providing employment to local tribals and would help store water and irrigate barren fields. The tribals, who, perhaps, were more appreciative of his sheer tenacity than the logic of his argument, agreed to immediately halt the attacks. In recognition of his act of courage, the British Indian Government awarded Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan the Tamgha-e-Shujaat (Medal of Bravery), a military medal seldom awarded to civilians. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan explained to the government that he did not deserve the medal since his bravery and success was aided by the fact that some of the labourers working on the project also belonged to the same tribe as those who were attacking them and they played a part in convincing their fellow tribals to halt the attacks. This honest explanation notwithstanding, the medal was awarded. The Khan Sahib medal that accompanies the Khan Sahib title, which was conferred upon Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan by the British Indian Government in 1931. In 1931, in recognition of his exemplary public service spanning 30 years, the 32nd Viceroy and Governor-General of India, Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon, on behalf of the British Indian Government, conferred upon Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan the title of Khan Sahib. In 1935, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan retired from government service and his career in civil engineering and returned to his vast estate in Jamalpur to manage his agricultural lands, which spanned . He built his residential complex known as \\"Qila Jamalpur\\" (Jamalpur Fort) at a cost of Rs. 100,000, a significant amount at the time. This structure stands to this day and Jamalpur today is also, alternatively, called \\"Qila Jamalpur\\". Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan was a philanthropist by heart and generously spread charity around him and donated money to various social causes and endowed various charitable and educational institutions with a share of his wealth, especially in the form of land. While spreading charity, he did not discriminate between Muslims and non-Muslims, however, he was particularly concerned about the plight of Muslims in India and, therefore, focused on them. He soon acquired a reputation in northern India as a notable philanthropist.  Dar ul Islam Movement and Trust  Logo of the Dar ul Islam Movement founded by Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan. The logo consists of the crescent and star representing Islam with a depiction of a book in the middle and the words \\"Parho aur Parhao\\" in Urdu meaning \\"Study and Teach\\". Inside the crescent are the words \\"Tehreek-e-Dar ul Islam\\" in Urdu meaning \\"Dar ul Islam Movement\\", circa 1940 Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan's reputation as a Muslim philanthropist soon caught the attention of South Asia's premier Muslim poet, philosopher and thinker, Allama Muhammad Iqbal who advised Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan to set up a research institute for Islamic learning that would lead to the education, enlightenment and empowerment of the Muslims of India who, since the fall of the Mughal Empire and the advent of the British Raj, had increasingly regressed economically, socially and politically and were trailing Hindus in education. Iqbal, who was promoting the idea of a separate state for Muslims in India, also felt that such educational establishments were necessary to educate a new crop of Muslim leaders once a separate Muslim state is established and who would play a leadership role in the new Muslim state. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan was greatly inspired by Allama Muhammad Iqbal and his vision for Muslims. In 1936, on the advice of Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan founded and established the Dar ul Islam Trust, which was registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and donated of land from his vast estate known as the \\"Jamalpur Fruit Farms\\" in Jamalpur (5 km west of Pathankot) in Gurdaspur District, Punjab State, India for the established of the first Dar ul Islam Trust Institute. The Dar ul Islam Trust's objectives included, inter alia, undertaking \\"...through all lawful means research on Islamic theology, culture and history and to publish and print works...\\" Among the scholars and thinkers participating in the Dar ul Islam project were: Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi and Maulana Sadruddin Islahi, both notable Qur'anic scholars and writers of the era; Muhammad Asad (formerly Leopold Weiss), a German Jewish convert to Islam, an Islamic scholar and journalist from Lahore; Mian Nizamuddin from Lahore; Shaikh Muhammad Yusuf, Barrister-at-Law from Gurdaspur; Chaudhry Rehmat Ali, Deputy Collector (Retd.) from Anhar; and Maulvi Fatah-ud-Deen, Deputy Director, Department of Agriculture, Punjab.http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/archive.php  Monthly Dar ul Islam journal  Cover of the Monthly Dar ul Islam Journal of the Dar ul Islam Movement, depicting \\"Khan Sahib Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan\\" as its publisher and printer, circa 1940 In 1940, the Dar ul Islam Movement began publishing an Urdu-language monthly journal called Monthly Dar ul Islam, from Pathankot, whose publisher and printer was Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan. The Dar ul Islam was a scholarly and literary journal whose purpose was to create enlightenment and awareness amongst the Muslims of British India and also to present the case for an independent state for Muslims in South Asia.  Maulana Maududi  Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan requested Allama Muhammad Iqbal to nominate an Islamic scholar with good management skills who could manage the day-to-day affairs of the Dar ul Islam Trust. Allama Muhammad Iqbal nominated Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, an eminent civil servant and Islamic scholar. At the time, Ghulam Ahmed Pervez had been tasked by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, then leader of the All India Muslim League, to publish a monthly journal titled Tolu-e-Islam the primary objective of which was to build the case for a separate Muslim state in India and to educate Muslim public opinion in India that according to the Qur'an, ideology and not geographical or ethnic divisions, was the basis for the formation of nation, and that a politically independent Islamic state was a pre-requisite for Muslims to live in accordance with the injunctions of Islam.Sulehria, Farooq, Maudoodi and Iqbal, The News, Lahore, 11 November 2011 When Ghulam Ahmed Pervez told Muhammad Ali Jinnah that he had been asked by Allama Muhammad Iqbal to join the Dar ul Islam Trust at Pathankot and sought his permission, Muhammad Ali Jinnah told Ghulam Ahmed Pervez to nominate someone else for the purpose as he wanted Ghulam Ahmed Pervez to focus entirely on the Tolu-e-Islam project. Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, therefore, recommended the name of Maulana Maududi to Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan. Ghulam Ahmed Pervez knew Maududi as a young, energetic and intelligent journalist working in Hyderabad Deccan who had considerable knowledge of Islam and felt that Maududi was the right person for the job. It was, therefore, at the recommendation of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez that Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan wrote to Maududi and invited him to join the Dar ul Islam Trust in Pathankot. The prospect of heading a well-endowed Islamic research institute with a custom-built campus near the picturesque foothills of the Himalayas was an attractive one for Maududi and he agreed. At the time, it was unknown to both Ghulam Ahmed Pervez and Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan that Maulana Maududi was against the creation of a separate state for Muslims in India and would go on to oppose the creation of Pakistan, which would eventually lead to Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan parting ways with Maududi. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, however, wanted Allama Muhammad Iqbal to personally approve the appointment of Maududi at Dar ul Islam. Therefore, when Maududi first visited the Dar ul Islam Trust, Pathankot, in 1937, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan took Maududi to meet Allama Muhammad Iqbal at Lahore. Like Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, Allama Muhammad Iqbal was also unaware of Maududi's opposition to a separate state for Muslims in India and, having no other reason to reject him, sanctioned Maududi's appointment at the Dar ul Islam Trust, Pathankot. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan remained the vital link between Iqbal and Maududi.Yusuf, M., 'Maudoodi: A Formative Phase', Islamic Order, Volume 1, Issue 3, 1979 (pp. 33‚Äì43) (This paper throws light on the relationship of Maududi with Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan and has been cited in Islamic movements in Egypt, Pakistan, and Iran: an annotated bibliography by Asaf Hussain (London: Mansell Publishing Limited; Bronx, N.Y.: Distributed in the U.S. and Canada by H.W. Wilson Co., 1983 ) In 1938, Maulana Maududi, then aged 35, arrived at Dar-ul-Islam in Pathankot and remained there for some time under the patronage of Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan before founding the religious political party Jamaat-e-Islami in Lahore in 1941.http://www.risingkashmir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=22616 It was at Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan's estate at Jamalpur where Maulana Maududi established his publishing house, the Maktabah Jama'at-i-Islami, which published Maulana Maududi's Musalman Aur Maujoodah Siyasi Kashmakash (\\"Muslims and the Current Political Dilemma\\"). In 1945, an all-India level conference of the Jamaat-e-Islami was held at the Dar ul Islam Institute, Pathankot. Among the attendees were Maulana Maududi, Maulana Said-ud-din, Maulana Saif-ud-din Qari and Maulana Ghulam Ahmad Ahrar. After the independence of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, the Jamaat-e-Islami was bifurcated into two separate political parties, namely the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind in India and the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, in his later years, with some of his grandchildren and Muhammad Asad (formerly Leopold Weiss) (seated right) and Asad's wife, Pola Hamida Asad (seated left), at Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan's house in Jauharabad, Pakistan, circa 1957 In his article, \\"Lessons from History\\", the noted Islamic scholar, Dr. Israr Ahmad, who himself was influenced by Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, writes about Maulana Maududi: > :Like the second runner in a relay race, another unconventional and > courageous young man appeared on the scene with the firm resolve to continue > the mission that was forsaken by Maulana Abul Kalam. He worked alone for > nearly seven years as a journalist, presenting a methodology for the > establishment of ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Kingdom‚Äù...and the revival of Islam as a complete > way of life. He then worked for sometime at Darul Islam an Islamic research > academy established by Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, a devotee of Allama Iqbal. He > finally laid the foundation of his own party in 1941, called Jama‚Äôat-e- > Islami, and started an organised movement. This young man was, of course, > none other than Maulana Sayyid Abul A‚Äôla Maududi (1903‚Äì1979). Although the genesis of the Jamaat-e-Islami can be traced to the Dar ul Islam Institute established by Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan in Pathankot, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan himself, being a committed \\"Muslim Leaguer\\", never joined the Jamaat- e-Islami nor had anything to do with its founding. This was due to Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan's disagreement with Maulana Maududi's and the Jamaat-Islami's ideology and approach on a number of issues, particularly on the idea of Pakistan, the creation of which was being opposed by Maulana Maududi and his Jamaat-e-Islami and being supported by Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan.  Pakistan  Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan was a member of the All-India Muslim League, the political party led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah that was fighting for a separate homeland for Muslims in India. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan's belief in Iqbal's dream for a separate homeland for Muslims in India and his support for the idea of Pakistan led to increased distance between him and Maulana Maududi. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan's support for the creation of Pakistan became evident immediately after Pakistan's independence on 14 August 1947 when Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, leaving his home and vast Jamalpur estate behind in the divided Independent India, migrated with his family to the newly established Muslim state of Pakistan and established there the second Dar-ul-Islam Trust Institute in Jauharabad in Khushab District in central Punjab.  Agriculture  Other than his contributions to civil engineering, philanthropy, religious scholarship and education, Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, being a premier fruit- grower and agriculturalist, is credited with having introduced to South Asia a variety of fruits and agricultural technologies from around the world, including being the one to introduce into India the exotic Persimmon, Lychee and Sapodilla (Chikoo) fruits from China and Japan, which, for the first time in India, were successfully planted and grown at his agricultural estate known as \\"Jamalpur Fruit Farms\\". All three of these fruits spread to other parts of India from the Jamalpur Fruit Farms. The famous lychee farms on the west bank of the River Ravi, west of Lahore, were planted by Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan's close friend, Mian Amiruddin (later Mayor of Lahore), from lychee tree saplings imported from the Jamalpur Fruit Farms. The notable agriculturist, Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha, who later became agriculture minister in President Ayub Khan's cabinet and known as the \\"Father of Agriculture\\" in Pakistan, also consulted Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan on mango farming techniques and technologies. Seeds of a variety of mango trees from the Jamalpur Fruit Farms were also shipped to South Africa, where they were successfully planted and grown and continue to be grown to this day. The vast Jamalpur Fruit Farms enabled Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan to experiment with innovative agricultural techniques and technologies, which were widely adopted in the agriculture of Punjab, particularly in the field of fruit agriculture. The Jamalpur Fruit Farms acquired a reputation of being one of the technologically advanced fruit farms in India. Students from India's then premier agriculture education establishment, the Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute, Lyallpur (now University of Agriculture, Faisalabad), used to make annual study trips to the Jamalpur Fruit Farms to study the advanced agricultural techniques and technologies being applied there . thumbnail  Family  Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan with his youngest son, Khan Muhammad Azam, at the Tomb of Muhammad Iqbal (on whose advice he established the Dar ul Islam Trust) in Hazuri Bagh, Lahore, Pakistan, circa 1952 Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan had two sons, Chaudhry Muhammad Aslam Khan and Khan Muhammad Azam, and three daughters, Jamila, Saadat and Salima. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan was a strong believer in quality education and this manifested in him providing his children with the best possible education. All three daughters completed their schooling. His eldest son, Muhammad Aslam Khan, was educated at one of India's most famous boys boarding schools, Colonel Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun, and his younger son, Khan Muhammad Azam, at Government College, Lahore and Trinity College, Oxford. Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan's son, Khan Muhammad Azam, is married to the eldest daughter of Amir Habibullah Khan Saadi, the pre-1947 Indian freedom fighter and post-1947 Pakistani political leader, and granddaughter of Khan Bahudur Rana Talia Muhammad Khan, the first Muslim Inspector-General of Police in British India. His grandson, K.D. Rana, was married to the daughter of Lieutenant General Bakhtiar Rana, Chief Martial Law Administrator (West Pakistan) and Commander, I Corps, Pakistan Army (1958‚Äì1966) and son of Rana Talia Muhammad Khan.  Later years  Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan died in Jauharabad (37-A civil lines), Pakistan on 24 February 1976 and is buried in the front courtyard of the Dar ul Islam Trust Institute, Jauharabad, which he founded and which continues to disseminate religious education to this day.

Lakkoskiti () is the short form name of a small \\"monastic village\\" of not more than 15 \\"huts\\" (houses) consisting the idiorrhythmic \\"skete of Aghiou Dimitriou tou Lakkou\\". Sited at the north foothills of Mount Athos, in Greece, in a valley crossed by Morfonou river and surrounded by a wonderful forest of chestnut trees, is inhabited by Romanian monks. Lakkoskiti belongs to Agiou Pavlou (Greek: ŒëŒ≥ŒØŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±œçŒªŒøœÖ, English: Saint Paul) Monastery. Spiritually, through its mother monastery, and like all the Athos peninsula, it is under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.  History  Very little is known about the history of Romanian Lakkoskiti. Monks were living there since the 10th century, belonging to the old Amalfinon Monastery which was soon abandoned and ruined, after the Schism between Eastern Orthodox and Western Roman Catholic Church in 1054 AD. In the 14th century some Serbs borrowed money from Vatopediou Monastery to revive the place but failed to pay it back. So later Vatopediou Monastery, after a deal with Agiou Pavlou Monastery, exchanged the land with other properties. Inscriptions of 1606 AD show that there were Slavs living there while in 1754 the monks are documented as Moldovans. In 1760 Moldovan monk Daniel organized it as Skete.Panagiotis Christou, \\"To Agion Oros\\", Patriarchal Institute of Patristic Studies, Epopteia ed., Athens, 1987 p 236. After the Greek Revolution of 1821 Moldovans and Vlachs stopped coming to Greece, as the situation was dangerous, while older monks returned home or died. Later new monks started coming again and Lakkoskiti received up to 90 monks in 24 huts. A new wider Kyriako (central church) of Saint Demetrios was built on the expenses of monk Ioustinos, along with a second church at the cemetery and a water-mill. The Vlach and Moldovan monks had constantly financial support from their government but lived there quietly without creating any political/ethnic problems.Panagiotis Christou, \\"To Agion Oros\\", Patriarchal Institute of Patristic Studies, Epopteia ed., Athens, 1987 p 303. Part of Moldova of that time now belongs to Romania, together with Vlachia (or Walachia) and Transylvania, while another part (the ex-Moldavian SSR) is today independent bearing the name Republic of Moldova. Lakkoskiti, being in a place hardly approachable, declined again slowly. In mid 1990s, when only one old monk was left, a new effort started with a new brotherhood, coming partially from the Romanian coenobitic Timiou Prodromou Skete and partially from Romania. Kyriakon and the huts were slowly rebuilt, the forest dirtroad was improved and more monks were added, under the guidance of geron Stefanos. As Lakkoskiti is far from the main roads, pilgrims-visitors are rare and the Romanian monks are really very attentive to them. The hut (kalivi) of Annunciation of the Virgin, at Lakkoskiti.

They are day-flying moths that can be easily mistaken for a butterfly due to the position in which they hold their wings. Description The head, thorax and abdomen are dark yellowish and reddish brown. The wings are yellowish and reddish brown. The hindwings are more uniform reddish brown. On the underside, there are dark striations and both the forewing and hindwing have three grey spots in the discal cell. There are four pale rufous bands along the medial, postmedial, submarginal region. left Taxonomy The species was named Tetragonus catamitus by Carl Geyer in 1832 based on a specimen from JavaGeyer (1832) Zutr√§ge zur Sammlung exotischer Schmettlinge 4:17 and later described under the name of Cleosiris fasciata by Frederic Moore.Moore, F. 1883, Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 1883: 15-18 The larvae were described later as being translucent green with a dark black semi-prognathous head and a prothorax with a well-developed prothoracic shield.

History They first met in 1992 when Dave became lead Guitarist in the band ‚ÄúPsycho Circus‚Äù of which Dan was the drummer. Despite enjoying all the fun of being part of the band and some local celebrity status, a weekend recording at Kenney Jones‚Äôs residential studio sparked a newfound interest in the recording process. So much so that the band decided to spend the night and slept under the mixing desk. This interest in recording led the pair to later study at The Gateway School of Recording and both graduated from the University with a Diploma in Sound Engineering. After graduating they formed the production company Whiteburn. Recognition soon followed and led to working with the legendary singer/songwriter David Essex who acknowledged their young talent and in 2000 asked them to produce his album ‚ÄúWonderful‚Äù. Since then they have produced over 70 tracks for David Essex spanning 8 albums in many different styles. The albums have all been very well received and numerous tracks made their way onto his gold selling Greatest Hits Album released in 2006 and his latest album ‚ÄòAll the Fun of the Fair‚Äô which reached number 13 in the album charts in the summer of 2008. Their work is also heavily featured in the recent sell out musical ‚ÄúAll the Fun of the Fair‚Äù which will be going to the Garrick theatre in the West End in the spring of 2010. Whiteburn's eclectic sound has also led them to work with the platinum selling contemporary classical artist, Maksim Mrvica. After remixing 2 tracks of extra content for the special release of his album \\"The Piano Player‚Äù, Whiteburn were asked to work with Maksim again to produce the official classical single for the Athens Olympics \\"Olympic Dream\\" which was also released on \\"Harmony\\" (The Official Athens 2004 Olympic Games Classical Album) and Maksim's \\"Variations Part I&II;\\" by EMI Classics. They have recently completed a project for West Ham United Football Club, where they were asked to produce an up-to-date version of their club song ‚ÄúI'm Forever Blowing Bubbles‚Äù.

Chengkung was a major terminal for \\"the Hump\\" trans-Himalayan transport aircraft between India and China for Tenth Air Force and Air Transport Command C-47 Skytrain and C-46 Commando aircraft. In addition, Air Technical Service Command maintained a maintenance and supply facility at the base to support the airlift operations over the Himalayas. In addition to the transport mission, Chengkung was used by the 374th and 375th Bombardment Squadrons, flying B-24 Liberator heavy bombers from the field beginning in March 1943. The 23d Fighter Group 76th Fighter Squadron staged P-51 Mustang fighters from the field beginning in October 1943. Also the 16th Fighter Squadron, with P-40 Warhawks arrived in October. Also photo-reconnaissance aircraft used Chengkung throughout the war, flying combat intelligence missions over Japanese-held territory until 30 September 1945 when operations ceased and the facility was closed. Today, the airfield has been dismantled, the land being used for agriculture. The only remnants of the base are parts of the main runway, which can be discerned in aerial photography. Taxiways and dispersals are largely removed, although some remain as single-lane roads connecting agricultural fields. No evidence of buildings or the support area remain.

They were brought together by their shared passion for 1960s and 1970s vintage instruments, such as the mellotron, the moog, and other old organs and drum machines, which they both subsequently incorporated in their music. After a short stint with Godin during Air's first incarnation, collaborating on Premiers Sympt√¥mes as a musician and arranger, as well as on Moon Safari, and co-writing '\\"Ce Matin- L√†\\"', Woodcock felt he needed to form his own band. He called on his old friend Pierre B√©gon-Lours, then a sound engineer who had access to a recording studio near Paris where they recorded their first demos in 1997. Another sound engineer, enlisted by B√©gon-Lours, joined the band for a couple of years. Their first concert took place in Brighton, in 1998. Soon after, they were signed by French independent record label, Atmosph√©riques. In 1998, mellow joined forces with Air and Sean Lennon for their first French tour. The first album, Another Mellow Winter, was released worldwide in 1999. They contacted the director, Roman Coppola, to shoot the video for the single \\"Another Mellow Winter\\". In 2000, Coppola asked mellow to score his 1960s-sci-fi debut feature CQ. At the same time, mellow scored the title track to Novocaine, a dark comedy by David Atkins, starring Steve Martin and Helena Bonham Carter. That year, mellow toured in Japan, the UK and the US. The soundtrack for CQ was released as mellow's second album in 2001. In between albums, mellow continued to work on other people's music, lending their hand to bands such as Major Deluxe, Nice Hashimoto, The Free Design, Philippe Katerine and Bridge & Tunnel. They also scored TV commercials (Gauloise cigarettes, EDF, Tommy Hilfiger and Johnson and Johnson). In 2004, their third album Perfect Colors was released. Woodcock and B√©gon-Lours toured with fellow French band Syd Matters. Their band included Lionel Rault (Flairs), Mark Kerr (Simple Minds, Rita Mitsouko) and Laurent Bauer (Venus Paradise). They designed their own recording studio in Saint-Cloud, Mellow Workshop, where they could switch roles and produce other artists. Since then, Woodcock and B√©gon-Lours have been working on their fourth album, with guest musicians such as Bent (Das Pop), R√©mi Alexandre (Syd Matters) and Samy Osta (Domingo), Julien Galner (Chateau Marmont). The next album is slated to be released later in 2015.

There is a very beautiful intaglio by him, representing Love seated and supporting himself on the ground, in the attitude of those figures of boys playing the game of astragals, which so often occurs in the works of ancient art. The form of the letters of the name Œ¶Œ°VŒìŒôŒõŒõ, the large size of the wings of the figure of Love, and the whole style of the gem, concur to show that the artist belonged to the earlier Greek school. There is also engraved upon this gem a bivalve shell, which also occurs on the coins of Syracuse; whence it may be inferred that the artist was a Syracusan. This conjecture becomes a certainty through the fact, recently published by Raoul- Rochette, that there exist medals of Syracuse, on which the name of Phrygillus is inscribed. One medal of this type is in the possession of R. Rochette himself, who has given an engraving of it on the title-page of his Lettre a M. Schorn, by the side of an engraving of the gem already mentioned. Another medal of this type is in the collection of the Due de Luynes. The same collection contains another very beautiful Syracusan medal, in bronze, bearing the inscription Œ¶Œ°Œ•, which no one can now hesitate to recognise as the initial letters of the name Phrygillus. Raoul-Rochette accounts these three medals to be among the most precious remains of ancient numismatic art. The identification, in this instance, of a distinguished medallist and gem- engraver, goes far to settle the question, which has been long discussed, whether those professions were pursued by the same or by different classes of artists among the Greeks(R. Rochette, Lettre a M. Schorn, pp. 79 ‚Äî83, 148, 2d edition.)

Laohwangping Airfield is a former World War II United States Army Air Forces airfield, located approximately 1 mile west of Jiuzhou Zhen (Guizhou Province) in the People‚Äôs Republic of China. History The airfield was the primary home of the 35th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, which flew unarmed P-38 Lightning photo-reconnaissance aircraft from the airfield beginning in February 1945 until the end of the war. It was also the home of the 23d Fighter Group 76th Fighter Squadron, equipped with P-51 Mustangs in February 1945. Records indicate this was most likely a very temporary facility, with a compressed earth runway with tents and small wooden buildings used for a support facility. It appears to have been closed and dismantled in September 1945 after the war ended, with the land being returned to agricultural use.

The Goodnight‚ÄìLoving Trail was a trail used in the cattle drives of the late 1860s for the large-scale movement of Texas Longhorns. It is named after cattlemen Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving. Route The Goodnight Loving Trail began at Fort Belknap (Texas), along part of the former route of the Butterfield Overland Mail, traveling through central Texas across the Staked Plains to Horsehead Crossing, north along the Pecos River and across Pope's Crossing, into New Mexico to Fort Sumner. The trail then continued north into Colorado up to Denver and was extended on into Wyoming. Goodnight and Loving's Drive of 1866 Navajo prisoners had to be fed by the U.S. government. In June 1866, Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving decided to make a partnership to drive cattle to growing western markets. They hoped that demand for beef from settlers, from soldiers stationed at military outposts across New Mexico, and from Navajos recently placed upon reservations near Fort Sumner, would make the drive profitable.Brown 1995, p. 285. With eighteen cowpunchers, they brought 2,000 head of cattle to Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Over eight thousand Navajo had been interned at the Bosque Redondo reservation under the control of the fort, but due to the poor conditions on the reservation for agriculture and inadequate planning by the US authorities for provisions, there was an urgent demand for new food supplies. Goodnight and Loving received eight cents a pound for the steers in the herd, although they were unable to interest the government agent in 800 stocker cattle. Goodnight returned to Texas with approximately $12,000 in gold to buy more cattle.Brown 1995, p. 286. Loving continued north towards the railhead in Denver, Colorado with the remaining cows and calves. He was stopped by a tollgate chain in the Raton Pass, operated by Richens Lacey Wootton. Loving paid Wootton 10 cents per head of cattle. In Denver, Loving sold the herd to John Wesley Iliff. Later developments During the Drive of 1867, at Horsehead Crossing, during a heavy storm, the herd was attacked by a party of Comanches, leaving it divided and scattered. Loving and \\"One Arm Bill\\" Wilson rode ahead towards Fort Sumner to advise them of the delay. They were ambushed by Comanches, and while both managed to escape, Loving died later refusing to have an amputation. Goodnight drove herds along the route over Raton Pass again in 1868, paying the toll. In February 1868, he began to drive slaughter herds to Cheyenne, Wyoming to be butchered and both marketed locally and shipped by railroad to markets in Chicago.Brown 1995, p. 315. In 1868 he also scouted a new route via the Trincheras Pass, in order to sell cattle to John W Iliff in Cheyenne.Brown 1995, p. 289. Iliff had become established as a leading commercial cattle rancher in his holdings along the Platte river, and sold beef to mining camps, railroad workers and government agents working on Indian reservations. Over the next decade, cattle ranches stocked with Texas Longhorn brought up along the trail were established across Wyoming. Several Texas companies relocated or started subsidiaries in Wyoming and Montana. Cheyenne became a hub for the local cattle business, with its Union Pacific railroad connection.Brown 1995, p. 316-7.

Loh Wai Kong sought a ruling from the courts that Malaysian citizens were entitled to travel overseas as a fundamental right under Article 5 of the Constitution. The Federal Court ruled that no such right existed. Background Loh was a permanent resident of Australia. He returned to Malaysia in April 1975, and was charged with a criminal offense in the High Court at Ipoh on 2 August 1976. Loh obtained bail on condition that he surrender his passport. On 2 March 1977, his passport expired, and Loh had it returned. He later applied for a new passport, citing the need to return to Australia by 1978, or his resident visa there would expire. The authorities rejected the application, saying that he was involved in a criminal case and that the issuance of a passport was at the discretion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King). Loh then filed suit in the High Court at Penang, asking the court to compel the government to issue him a passport, on the grounds that the right to travel abroad is a fundamental liberty protected by the Constitution. The High Court rejected Loh's application, but made a number of statements in its ruling which the government disagreed with. In particular, the trial judge held that the phrase \\"personal liberty\\" in Article 5 of the Constitution included the right to leave the country, and that the refusal to issue a passport constituted an infringement of the right to personal liberty. The government thus appealed to the Federal Court for clarification. In the Federal Court, Loh's lawyer said that although Loh did not have an absolute right to a passport, he did have a qualified right on condition of good character. The government responded that no such right, absolute or qualified, existed. Judgment The judgment penned by Lord President Tun Mohamed Suffian Mohamed Hashim held that the Constitution is silent as to the right to travel overseas, although it refers to the right to travel and reside within the country. Suffian noted the Indian case of Satwant Singh Sawhney v D Ramarathnam, where the Indian courts held that Article 21 of the Constitution of India -- roughly corresponding with the Malaysian Article 5 -- does include the right to travel abroad. However, he cited with approval the minority judgment in the case, and stated that the issuance of passports was a prerogative of the Malaysian government, concluding: References See also * Lee Kwan Woh v.

The genus apparently dispersed from Asia into North America about 20 Mya, becoming the earliest member of the subfamily Ursinae in the New World. Qiu points out that if a questionable 29 million-year-old specimen of Ursavus reported in North America is validated, Ursavus may have evolved in North America and dispersed westward into Asia. The higher number of fossils in Europe grading toward eastern Asia make the westward dispersal unlikely.

It was founded in 2005 in Vienna during the 1st European Transgender Council as \\"European Transgender Network\\" and it is currently a registered NGO as \\"Transgender Europe\\". Since 2009, in collaboration with the online magazine \\"Liminalis\\", TGEU runs the project \\"Trans Murder Monitoring\\" (TMM) that records the many people who every year around the world are killed as result of anti-trans violence. History TGEU was established on the first European Transgender Council in Vienna in November 2005 and formally registered as an Austrian charitable organisation 14 months later. Run as a volunteer organisation for many years, TGEU established itself as legitimate voice of the trans community in Europe. In 2008 TGEU acquired their first independent project-based funding. However, it took until 2009 to hire first project staff (to implement the TvT project). In 2012 the General Assembly held in Dublin decided to move the seat of the organisation to Berlin, a process that was finalised with the closing of the Austrian association at the General Assembly held in Budapest in 2014. Today, TGEU has an office in Berlin, ten members of staff and a Board of nine volunteers governing the organisation. TGEU continues to combine advocacy work in Europe and Central Asia with community work in partnership with member groups. Vision TGEU envisions Europe, Central Asia, and the rest of the world free from discrimination, where each person can live according to their gender identity and gender expression without interference, and where trans people are respected and valued. TGEU works towards this vision through advocacy work, community building, and research projects. Mission TGEU's mission is to give trans people a voice and platform in Europe, Central Asia, and also the rest of the world. TGEU advocates for trans rights and social justice, raises awareness on issues trans people face, and supports a strong trans movement in collaboration with others. TGEU: * gives trans people a voice in Europe and Central Asia; * advocates for trans people‚Äôs human rights; * raises awareness on issues trans people are facing; * supports a strong trans movement; * conducts and encourage research for the benefit of trans people; * is an active part of the international trans movement. Research Trans Murder Monitoring The Trans Murder Monitoring (TMM) project systematically monitors, collects and analyses reports of homicides of trans and gender-diverse people worldwide. The Trans Murder Monitoring project started in April 2009 as a cooperation between Transgender Europe (TGEU) and the academic online magazine Liminalis ‚Äì A Journal for Sex/Gender Emancipation and Resistance. With the involvement of the editorial team of Liminalis, the TMM became a pilot project of Transgender Europe's \\"Transrespect versus Transphobia Worldwide\\" research project in September 2009. Legal and Social Mapping The TvT \\"Legal and Social Mapping\\" research project was conducted by Transgender Europe in close cooperation with activists and experts from all world regions, who were able to draw on their expertise regarding current political processes and actual legal and social practices. The categories included in the mapping are; legal gender recognition, anti-discrimination, hate-crime and asylum legislation, criminalisation, prosecution and state-sponsored discrimination, trans- specific health care, community and movement, good practices and reports of transphobic incidents.

CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2008),Cartoon Network, LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc. , 536 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2008). was a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision regarding copyright infringement in the context of digital video recorders. Among other reasons, it is notable for disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit's holding in MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., regarding whether a momentary data stream is a \\"copy.\\" In the case, Cablevision, a cable television provider, sought to create a hosted DVR (Digital Video Recorder) service. A consortium of copyright holders in the television and film industries sued for direct copyright infringement on the grounds of unlawful copying and public performance. The appeals court found that a) the automated copying of content at user request did not constitute direct infringement, b) Time shifting, or replaying content to the original audience, did not constitute public performance, and c) the copying of streaming content for the purposes of buffering did not itself constitute unlawful copying.  Background Information  Around March 2006, Cablevision, a cable television provider, announced the development of a \\"Remote Storage DVR\\" (RS-DVR). Similar in operation to a traditional digital video recorder (DVR), Cablevision's DVR allowed customers to pause, record, and replay and/or rewind previously recorded content. Unlike traditional DVRs, which require an appliance containing a hard drive to be placed in the home of the subscriber, the Cablevision DVR stored content on servers at Cablevisions broadcast facilities. To implement the DVR service, Cablevision streamed their existing digital television system through a second server, which identified requested content, then copied and streamed this content onto permanent storage for later retrieval. At various points in the system, content was buffered for periods of several seconds (0.1 and 1.2 seconds respectively). Notably, content requested by a particular user was stored separately and independently for that user and replayed only to the user who requested it. Cablevision announced their intention to release the service and were sued for direct copyright infringement by a consortium of television and movie copyright holders including Turner Broadcasting and its subsidiaries Cartoon Network and CNN; Twentieth Century Fox; NBCUniversal subsidiaries NBC and Universal Studios; Paramount Pictures; Disney and its subsidiary ABC; and CBS. The consortium sued only for declaratory relief and injunctive relief on the grounds of direct copyright infringement, excluding from consideration the topic of contributory copyright infringement. In their response, Cablevision waived any defense based on fair use.  District Court  Cartoon Network, et al. claimed copyright infringement on three grounds: * The buffering of streaming data, necessary for the RS-DVR's operation, constituted the creation of unlicensed copies in RAM. * The persistence of complete copies on Cablevision hard drives also constituted the creation of unlicensed copies. * Transmitting hard drive copies to RS-DVR users in response to a \\"play\\" request constituted unlicensed public performance. Cablevision argued that: * Buffered content was de minimis because of the extremely limited duration and size of content storage. * The creation of hard drive copies was done by consumers and only facilitated by Cablevision, and hence that Cablevision was at most guilty of contributory infringement (not at issue in the case). * The transmission of hard drive copies was made only to the user who requested content and to their home, not \\"to the public\\". On consideration, the district court found: * Buffered copies were fixed, following MAI Systems v. Peak Computer, in so far as they were copyable. * Buffering was not de minimis since the \\"aggregate effect of the buffering\\" was to reproduce the entirety of the work. * Due to the \\"continuing relationship\\" between Cablevision and the volitional design of the system to copy content, Cablevision was the maker of the hard drive copy even though the copy was automatically made by the RS-DVR at the customer's request. * Transmission of hard drive copies constituted public performance since Cablevision would transmit \\"the same program\\" to different members of the public. The district court awarded summary judgment to the plaintiffs and enjoined Cablevision from operating the RS-DVR system.  Circuit Court  Cablevision appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the Circuit Court reversed and vacated the judgment, and remanded the case in August 2008. The Circuit Court rejected the District Court's reasoning on all three grounds.  Buffering of data  On the topic of content buffering, and more broadly on the topic of the creation of RAM copies being infringing, the Second Circuit court noted that the Copyright Act requires two conditions for a work to be \\"fixed\\" and hence infringing: the work must be both \\"embodied in a copy or phonorecord\\" and perceivable \\"for a period of more than a transitory duration\\"17 USC ¬ß 101 (which the court denotes as the \\"embodiment\\" and \\"duration\\" requirements). It found the District Court relied too heavily on the embodiment requirement and did not properly consider the duration requirement. In this, the Circuit Court noted the lower court's reliance on MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., a Ninth Circuit case which held the creation of RAM copies to be infringing. The Circuit Court found this case did not directly address the duration requirement and showed only the necessity of the embodiment criterion, not its sufficiency. Indeed, the alternative interpretation, as the court points out, would read the \\"transitory duration\\" language out of the copyright act. The Circuit Court thus held that while the data was embodied in the buffer, the duration was sufficiently small to be considered transitory. As has been pointed out in editorials,Zohar Efroni - The Cartoon Network v. CSC Holdings & Cablevision Systems Stanford Law School: Center for Internet and Society. the court does not, in this decision, establish 1.2 seconds as a benchmark for determining transitory duration and the maximum duration of retention under which a work is transitory remains an unclear area of copyright law.  Direct liability for creating the playback copies  As identified in the District Court, the dispositive question in determining liability for direct copyright infringement with respect to the copies stored on hard drives in the Cablevision RS-DVR was who made the copies. The District Court held that Cablevision made the copies, albeit at the customer's request. The Circuit Court disagreed. Both parties in the case cited a line of cases originating with Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communications Services, which established the requirement for \\"some element of volition or causation\\" in the creation of a copy for it to be infringing. Here, the Circuit Court found that while Cablevision engaged in some volitional conduct by creating a system which exists only to reproduce conduct, it was not \\"sufficiently proximate\\" to the act of copying to be liable for direct infringement. The Circuit Court held that the claims brought by Cartoon Network, et al., were more relevant to claims of contributory infringement, which was not at issue in the case.  Transmission of RS-DVR playback  In contrast to the District Court, which held that the determination of a transmission being made to the public should be made on the grounds of the audience of the underlying work, the Circuit Court held that such a determination should be made by considering only the potential audience for the particular copy of a work. As Cablevision transmitted only the copy requested and recorded \\"by\\" a particular user to that user on that receiver used to request the copy, the transmission was not \\"to the public.\\"  Findings  The Circuit Court held that Cablevision's proposed DVR system did not directly infringe Cartoon Network, et al.'s rights of reproduction and public performance on any of the three claimed grounds. They thus reversed, vacated, and remanded the District Court's decision. It is also perceived to be especially important with respect to establishing copyright liability protection for cloud computing and remote-storage providers.David Johnson, DOJ Asks U.S. Supreme Court Not to Hear Case with Potential Major Impact on Cloud- Computing Copyright Issues , Digital Media Lawyer Blog (June 3, 2009).

Biography  Jean-Baptiste Willermoz was born on 10 July 1730 in Lyon. He was the oldest of 12 children. He lived mainly in Lyon. He was the brother of Pierre-Jacques Willermoz, a physician and chemist who also worked on the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and D'Alembert. He was a manufacturer in silk and silver at Rue des Quatre-Chapeaux, and as a volunteer director of charities, he played an important role in the European freemasonry of his time. As such he was initiated at the age of 20 and became Venerable Master of his lodge at 23. As a mystic, passionate about the secret nature of initiation, he contributed to the creation of the Regular Grand Lodge of Masters in Lyon and became its Grand Master in 1761. The Grand Lodge practised the seven Masonic high-degrees of the time, and added an eighth named \\"Scottish Grand Master, Knights of the Sword and the Rose-Croix.\\" Willermoz founded in this setting, in 1763, together with his brother Pierre-Jacques, a lodge entitled \\"Sovereign Chapter of Knights of the Black Eagle Rose-Cross\\" which was devoted to alchemical research. He was admitted to first grade in the Order of the Elus Cohens at Versailles in 1767 personally by Martinez de Pasqually on the recommendation of Bacon of Chivalerie and the Marquis de Lusignan. In May 1768 he was admitted to the R√©aux-Croix. In 1772 he corresponded with the Strasbourg lodge of the Strict Observance. After the death of Martinez de Pasqually in September 1774, he engaged with his friend and Cohen-brother Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin to write a comprehensive review of the doctrine of the Elus Cohens, in the form of lessons, called \\"the Lessons of Lyon\\" to be held from 7 January 1774 to 23 October 1776. He said in a letter of 1780 to the Prince of Hesse that he was given the rank of R√©au-Croix in the Order of Martinez Pasqually. In the 1770s, he came into contact with Baron von Hund and the German Order of the Order of Strict Observance which he joined in 1773 with the chivalric name Eques ab Eremo and Chancellor of the Chapter of Lyons. In 1774 he set up Strict Observance's Lyon lodge, La Bienfaisance, and became chancellor of its new province, the directory of Auvergne. It was under his leadership that the \\"Convent of Gaul, Lyon was held in 1778 that recognized the degrees of Prof√®s and Grands Prof√®s and constituted the 'Beneficent Knights of the Holy City (CBCS). Willermoz introduced also at the Convention of Lyon the R√©gime Ecossais Rectifi√© (Rectified Scottish Rite), which combined Templar Freemasonry with the religious ceremonial of the Elect Co√´ns. In 1782, Willermoz wrote that there are three kinds of alchemical freemasons: *Those who think that the purpose of Masonry is to make the Philosopher's Stone. *Those who search for the Panacea. *Those who search for the Science of Great Work by which man would find the wisdom and practices of early Christianity (to which he himself subscribed) Owing to disagreements within the Rite of Strict Observance, Willermoz organized in July 1782 the convent of Wilhelmsbad where 33 delegates attended in Europe and saw to the creation of the Rectified Scottish Rite There he defended the place of Martinist currents in the rite, through the delegacy of Joseph de Maistre who sent his famous Memorandum to the Duke of Brunswick. This was not supported by the other delegates. Very reserved towards Cagliostro, he thought, after several conversations with him, that he did not promote an \\"orthodox\\" Christianity in his eyes. He therefore urged members of the Knights Beneficent not to give any credence to him, nor to the lodge he founded in 1785 in Paris, the first mother-lodge of the Egyptian rite, whose name was \\"the Wisdom Triumphant\\". Worried about the eventual outbreak of the Revolution, he hid in Ain, in a house belonging to his brother Pierre-Jacques, taking with him his extensive Masonic archive. He was later appointed General of the Department of the Rhone by the Prime Consul on 1 June 1800, an office he held for 15 years. He resumed his Masonic activities with a resurgence of the CBCS in 1804, and dedicated himself to this end until his death (in Lyon) at age 94 on 29 May 1824.

The case concerned the allegedly wrongful dismissal of Tan Tek Seng, a senior assistant of a primary school.

In his judgment, Gopal Sri Ram held: Since Tan was deprived of gainful employment without a fair hearing, under this broad interpretation of Article 5, his dismissal was wrongful and unconstitutional. In 1997, the Federal Court cited the decision with approval as part of an obiter dictum in R. Rama Chandran v. The Industrial Court of Malaysia.

Judgment High Court Court of Appeal Supreme Court The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal. Lord Mance gave the judgment of the court with Lords Hope, Rodger, Collins and Kerr concurring. Lord Mance started by referring to the governing sections of the Extradition Act 2003 which were to be found in Part 1 of the Act (which deals with European Arrest Warrants) and went on to look at the Council Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant issued by the European Union which was implemented in the United Kingdom via Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003. National courts are under an obligation to interpret national law as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the framework decision in order to attain the result which it pursues. In particular, Lord Mance looked at Articles 1(1), 2(1) and 8(1) as well as sections (b) and (f) of the annexed modern European Arrest Warrant. In particular, Article 8(1)(c) provides that, ‚ÄúThe European arrest warrant shall contain the following information‚Ä¶ (c) evidence of an enforceable judgment, an arrest warrant or any other enforceable judicial decision having the same effect, coming within the scope of Articles 1 and 2‚Ä¶‚Äù. It had been argued before the Divisional Court that the phrase ‚Äúany other warrant‚Äù in Section 2(4)(b) of the 2003 Act should include European arrest warrants. This argument was rejected on the basis of five points: On this basis, the Divisional Court held that Article 8(1)(c) and Section 2(4)(b) were concerned with domestic judgments, arrest warrants or other decisions, and not with any other EAW issued in respect of the alleged offending, still less one which had been withdrawn. At the Supreme Court, it had been argued that the fifth point was flawed and that there was a purpose to requiring evidence of any other EAWs, even if withdrawn, in that they could constitute the basis of, or be relevant to, a decision by the executing court to set side (or consider whether to set aside) the subsisting EAW as an abuse of process. Lord Mance rejected this argument. The text in Article 8(1)(g) and section (f) of the model EAW did not oblige disclosure of previous EAWs and subsequently there was no reason to interpret Section 2(4)(b) of the 2003 Act as ‚Äúintended to require the executing court to be informed by the EAw of one (and only one) point ‚Äì the existence of another EAW ‚Äì which might, in some conceivable case, be of some conceivable relevance to an argument of abuse of process. Furthermore, other ‚Äúdue factors‚Äù were covered by Sections 11 to 20 of the 2003 Act and Section 21 of the 2003 Act which provided a general safeguard that the judge must decide whether surrender would be compatible with the European Convention of Human Rights.

Synopsis In autumn 1969, artist and filmmaker Blake James is getting restless, and seeks to escape from his boring job at an advertising agency in Montreal. In his never-ending quest for freedom, Blake sets out for his cabin in the woods near Meech Lake, where he has parked his biplane. His friends have commented on his quirky behaviour, and yet describe him as sweet and intelligent, but almost naive. Feeling a restlessness, Blake begins to gather the materials for a long cross-country flight out of the jumble of items piled up in his cabin. Without a definite plan for where he is going, Blake flies during daylight hours, generally heading westward. He relies on the most rudimentary navigation, including maps and following train tracks and roads. His biplane does not even have a radio. When he wanders into the landing pattern of Montreal International Airport, Blake causes delays for the airliners in both landing and takeoff positions. Instead of getting into trouble, his impromptu landing brings out all the pilots and air traffic control personnel to see the unique biplane. The journey takes many strange turns, with Blake joining a flock of geese at one point. When he loses his map, after a vain attempt to retrieve it, he follows train tracks to a farm, where he lands and beds down for the night under the wings of his aircraft. A young boy, curious at the sight of an biplane in his family's farmyard, wakes Blake up and gets a chance to sit in the cockpit and wear Blake's flying goggles. Finally, with a throw of the propeller, Blake flies away, continuing his vagabond wandering. Cast * Blake James as Himself * Bill Mason (uncredited as the narrator) * Douglas Jackson (uncredited as a friend talking to the narrator) * Paul Mason as the boy Production Mason and James first met at a commercial art studio in Winnipeg.

Retrieved: January 10, 2016. He also starred in Mason's acclaimed short film The Rise and Fall of the Great Lakes (1968). Aerial filming involved both Mason and James, with Blake's biplane equipped with film cameras on the wingtips and in front of the cockpit. Filming Blake was fraught with difficulty and was sometimes dangerous; on one occasion, Mason lost sight of James while filming from another aircraft. It was discovered that James had been forced to land on an island in the St. Lawrence River after forgetting to switch on his main fuel tank. Because there was no radio in the vintage biplane, Mason and James resorted to using hand signals. With James being able to trigger the cameras on his aircraft, he tended to fly in an unorthodox pattern, looking for suitable aerial views of clouds or landscape, but often left Mason, following in a \\"camera aircraft\\", far behind. If they were too far apart, Mason would have to land and wait for James to come down; he simply called his friend \\"lost\\" on those occasions.

In late August, the 311th Fighter Group was reassigned from Tenth Air Force in Burma to Pungchacheng with P-51 Mustangs, remaining at the base until the end of the war in September 1945.

This combination has been reported to significantly reduce the risk of relapse in AML. The effect is particularly pronounced in patients in their first remission who are below the age of 60. The combination of histamine dihydrochloride and interleukin-2 was approved for use in AML patients within the European Union in October 2008Committee For Medicinal Products For Human Use: Summary Of Positive Opinion for Ceplene (2008-11-25) and will be marketed in the EU by the Swedish pharmaceutical company Meda. The drug is also available through a named patient program in several other countries (excluding the US). Proposed mechanism of action Histamine dihydrochloride acts by improving the immune-enhancing properties of IL-2, and laboratory studies have shown that this combination can induce immune-mediated killing of leukemic cells. The treatment (in the form of subcutaneous injections) is given in 3-week cycles by the patients at home for 18 months, thus coinciding with the period of highest relapse risk. The side-effects include transient flush and headache, whereas IL-2 may induce low-grade fever and inflammation at the site of injection.

La place Pigalle en 1878 (1878), etching, aquatint and drypoint, New York Public Library. F√©lix Hilaire Buhot (July 9, 1847 - April 26, 1898) was a French painter and illustrator. Among the most original prints made in France during the last quarter of the nineteenth century are those by F√©lix Buhot. Along with artists like Charles Jacque, Louis Monzi√®s and F√©lix Bracquemond, he is credited with reviving seventeenth-century etching techniques in late nineteenth-century art. However, he was highly experimental and regularly employed technical variables and regularly combined multiple processes to produce a single print. He used traditional techniques of etching, drypoint, and aquatint along with modern methods such as photomechanical reproduction. Buhot‚Äôs most notable contribution to the history of printmaking is a device he termed \\"marges symphoniques\\" (symphonic margins). Inspired by the marginal decorations of medieval manuscripts and eighteenth-century French book illustrations, Buhot developed two types of margins, etching the first on the same plate as the central subject and printing the second, called a ‚Äúfalse margin,‚Äù from a separate plate.National Gallery of Art In his many prints of city views and seascapes, Buhot was intent on creating a specific atmosphere, especially the effects of weather such as rain, snow, mist, and fog. He turned to his immediate neighborhood in and around the boulevard de Clichy in Montmartre, Paris, for inspiration for his prints of everyday city life. Buhot delighted in portraying the varied street life of the vibrant capital city not only in different seasons (Winter in Paris, 1879) but also in moments of public display, from a festive holiday celebration (National Holiday on the Boulevard de Clichy, 1878) to a somber death observance (Funeral Procession on the Boulevard de Clichy, 1887). His city views also include London scenes (Westminster Palace and Westminster Bridge, both of 1884). And Buhot's love for the sea is evidenced in the many prints exploring its ever-changing atmospheric conditions and moods. Buhot's boat trips to England inspired two of his most characteristic prints, A Pier in England and Landing in England, both from 1879. With his experimental printmaking techniques, Buhot became one of the best-known, admired, and collected printmakers of his day. He achieved success for his prints at the annual Salons between 1875 and 1886, and a number of his works were published in leading periodicals and books. He also found critical acclaim and support for his prints in the United States, especially after his first one-man exhibition organized by the New York print dealer Frederick Keppel in 1888. On February 15, 1888 he made an exhibition in New York City. He died in 1898. References * Abb√© J.L.

Biography Egnatius Victor was a member of the third century gens Egnatia, and it has been speculated that he was the son of Lucius Egnatius Victor, consul suffectus before AD 207. In AD 213 he was coopted to serve with the sodales Antoniniani. He was then appointed Legatus Augusti pro praetore of Galatia in AD 218, before being appointed suffect consul sometime between AD 225 and 230.Mennen, p. 101 Around AD 230, Egnatius Victor was appointed Corrector of the province of Achaea. This was followed by his posting as Legatus Augusti pro praetore of Bithynia et Pontus sometime between AD 230 and 235. It has been speculated that he was also Legatus Augusti pro praetore of Pannonia Inferior sometime during the reign of Alexander Severus (AD 222 ‚Äì 235). Egnatius Victor and his brother-in-law Valerian were probably important senatorial supporters of the Gordiani, and he reached the pinnacle of his career during the reign of Gordian III when, between AD 242 and 244 he became the Proconsular governor of Asia, which he held for three years. He was possibly assigned to the province extra sortem (or outside the usual assignment of senatorial provinces by lot) by Gordian III in relation to his planned campaign against the Sassanid Empire. Egnatius Victor was retained as governor by Philip the Arab after the death of Gordian III, indicating he gave immediate support to Philip after he returned from the Persian campaign.Mennen, pp. 101 & 103 Finally, in AD 254, he was appointed Praefectus urbi of Rome by his brother-in-law Valerian who had become emperor the year before. Egnatius Victor was probably the brother of Egnatia Mariniana, who was the wife of Valerian and mother of Gallienus. It has been conjectured that he had a son named Egnatius Lucillianus;Settipani, Christian, Continuit√© gentilice et continuit√© s√©natoriale dans les familles s√©natoriales romaines √† l'√©poque imp√©riale (2000), pp. 398-400 however, a relationship between the imperial gens Egnatia and Egnatius Lucillianus has been described as very doubtful.

This collaboration involves many telescopes observing at optical, near-infrared, and radio (millimetric and centimetric) wavelengths. Thanks to their different geographic location all around the world, the emission variations of the pointed source can be monitored 24 hours a day, with the observing task moving from east to west as the Earth rotates. WEBT observations are often carried out in conjunction with observations at higher frequencies, from ultraviolet to gamma rays, performed by both space and ground-based telescopes. In this way, information on blazar emission over almost the whole electromagnetic spectrum can be obtained. The multi-wavelength studies performed by the WEBT have the purpose of understanding the physical mechanisms that rule the variable emission of these celestial objects. This emission mainly comes from a plasma jet pointing closely to the line of sight, and originating from a supermassive black hole located in the core of the host galaxy. Foundation The WEBT was founded in autumn 1997 by John Mattox, from the Institute of Astrophysical Research at the Boston University, as a collaboration among optical observers. Three years after, in 2000, the leadership was committed to Massimo Villata, from the Observatory of Turin. A constitution was issued, defining purposes and management of the organization. Soon after, also radio and near-infrared observers joined the consortium. Observing campaigns Until February 2009, the WEBT has organised 24 observing campaigns, with the participation of more than one hundred telescopes. Each campaign is devoted to a specific source, and is led by a Campaign Manager appointed by the President. The Campaign Manager is responsible for the observing strategy, data collection, analysis and interpretation, and finally takes care of the publication of the results. Blazar 3C 66A (on the far right) as seen by HST. Even with the WFPC2 this object appears star-like.

The GASP On September 4, 2007, the WEBT started a new project: the GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP). Its aim is to provide observing support at longer wavelengths to the observations by the gamma-ray satellites GLAST (Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope, later renamed Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in honor of the famous Italian physicist Enrico Fermi), and AGILE (Astro-rivelatore Gamma a Immagini LEggero). The GASP strategy is a long-term monitoring of selected targets, with periodic data gathering and analysis. The list of the GASP monitored blazars includes 28 bright objects: 3C 66A, AO 0235+16, PKS 0420‚àí01, PKS 0528+134, S5 0716+71, PKS 0735+17, OJ 248, OJ 49, 4C 71.07, OJ 287, S4 0954+65, Markarian 421, 4C 29.45, ON 231, 3C 273, 3C 279, PKS 1510‚àí08, DA 406, 4C 38.41, 3C 345, Markarian 501, 4C 51.37, 3C 371, PKS 2155‚àí304, BL Lacertae, CTA 102, 3C 454.3 and 1ES 2344+514.

Population: the village is based on the Iultin-Egvekinot road, one of the few significant roads in the Okrug. Reindeer herding is the most significant economic activity in the village. Municipally, Amguema is subordinated to Iultinsky Municipal District and incorporated as Amguema Rural Settlement. Demographics The most recent census figures show a population of 531, of which 279 are men and 252 women. The village is a traditional Chukchi settlement,Dallman, Map 3.6 in which most of the citizens are reindeer herders,Strogoff, p.126 taking advantage of the pasture present around the river Amguema (Chukchi: O'mvaam). It is the only native settlement in the district to have a stable economy, thanks in part to the available land. The population as of 2006 was 570, up slightly on the 2003 estimate of 548,Red Cross Chukotka - Iultinsky District (Archived) of whom 387 were indigenous peoples and of those 379 of them were Chukchi. Culture In August, the village is the host of the Vylgynkoranymat festival (lit. young reindeer festival), during which time, a slaughter occurs so that the residents may have sufficient skins for clothing for the forthcoming winter. At the end of the festival, the women of the village produce a dish called kivlet, boiled reindeer stomachs, complete with their undigested final meal to which venison, blood and onions are added and is said to resemble goulash when cooked. As with many of the settlements in Chukotka, there are neolithic remains to be found in the area surrounding the village. Economy The inhabitants of Amguema survive almost entirely through reindeer husbandryVat√©, p.48 and the Sovkhoz, with 11,166 head, is thought to have the second-largest number of reindeer in the whole Okrug, looked after by six brigades, the structure a remnant of the Soviet era.Vat√©, p.47 Each brigade is responsible for between 760 and 3710 reindeer. In an area where land-based transport is scarce, the village is fortunate to be connected to one of the few roads, being situated about halfway along the paved road that runs from Egvekinot in the south, to the former mining village of Iultin, on the 91st kilometer. The majority of the population are reindeer herders, with 84 people working on the tundra in 2003. Beyond the comparative ease with which inhabitants of Amguema can reach the outside world, the village has also been a major beneficiary of the money spent on the region by the former governor, Roman Abramovich. The village has a boarding school for all ages, which is a rarity in the region, and the village serves as an educational hub for the surrounding villages whose schools do not cover all age groups. As well as the school, Abramovich funded the construction of 46 new homes, at a cost of nearly $2.5 million, with hot water and indoor facilities, as well as a guesthouse, barbers and banya. There is also a food store, a post-office, a daycare center and a bakery. The school in Amguema is a boarding school and is used to educate not only the children from village but also other children from Nutepelmen and Vankarem, who are sent there when they are seven or eight. Transport Amguema is situated on the Iultin-Egvekinot road, one of the few permanent roads in Chukotka. Within the village, there is also a small road network including:Pochtovik Mail Delivery Service Iultinsky District *—É–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω—ã–π (Ulitsa Vostochniy, lit.

The first of this class of ship named after the village, a polar cargo ship, was among a number of Russian cargo ships and ice-breakers stuck in ice at Kosa Dvukh Pilotov in 1983 on a journey from Magadan to Mys Shmidta, when the winter sea ice formed significantly earlier than usual.Horensma, p.144 Climate Amguema has a Tundra climate (ET)McKnight and Hess, pp.235-7 because the warmest month has an average temperature between and .

He was taught art by Cipriano Borja, Ram√≥n Vargas, Rafael Vanegas, Andr√©s Acosta, Tom√°s Camacho, Santos Cevallos, and Antonio Salas. The latter was considered one of the best painters of his time. Pinto's family became poor following the 1853 death of his father. To earn money, Pinto began to give classes in culture, while continuing his art studies. Pinto married Eufemia Berrio in 1876. Soon after, he began to specialize in engraving. In 1877, Pinto illustrated Federico Gonz√°lez Su√°rez's book Estudio Hist√≥rico Sobre los Ca√±aris. Juan Manosalvas taught Pinto watercolor technique, though Pinto soon surpassed Manosalvas in talent. At the turn of the 20th century, his indigenous costumbrismo was popular both in Ecuador and abroad. His notable clients included Rogelio Bonnal and the French minister Hip√≥lito Fandiu. In 1903, Pinto taught in Cuenca's Escuela de Pintura. Beginning in 1904, he taught painting in Quito's Escuela de Bellas Artes.

Sugumar Balakrishnan sought the reinstatement of his entry permit to the state of Sabah. The Federal Court ultimately ruled that the right to personal liberty guaranteed by Article 5 of the Constitution cannot be construed in broad, generous terms, and as such denied Sugumar's application. Background Sugumar had applied to the High Court for a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Sabah state government which revoked his entry permit on grounds of morality. The High Court held that the ouster clause in section 59a of the Immigration Act 1959/63 meant the courts had no grounds for judicial review of the Sabah government's decision. Sugumar appealed to the Court of Appeal, which overruled the High Court and granted the writ he sought. The Court of Appeal held that ouster clauses are unconstitutional except in cases of national security (such as those involving the Internal Security Act) or overriding national interest. The preclusion of the right to judicial review was a violation of Article 5 of the Constitution, which was to be read in a broad manner, in line with Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan & Another. The Court of Appeal further ruled that Parliament had not intended to give the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak untrammeled discretion to cancel entry permits. The Sabah authorities then appealed to the Federal Court. Judgment The Federal Court quashed the Court of Appeal decision. With regard to the Immigration Act, Federal Justice Mohamed Dzaiddin held: The Federal Court also overruled the Court of Appeal ruling on the broad interpretation of Article 5 liberties in Tan Tek Seng: In 2009, the Federal Court would go on to reverse itself in Lee Kwan Woh v.

Levinson's video rallied support behind saving the Film Exchange from sale or demolition by then-owner University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). In 2009, YPA proposed the Paramount Film Exchange for official historical designation by the City of Pittsburgh. The Historic Review Commission of the City of Pittsburgh granted landmark designation in early 2010 based on \\"the importance of a particular place to Pittsburgh's heritage.\\" The YPA attributed the site's historical significance to its status as the last remnant of Pittsburgh's \\"film row\\". UPMC and the Exchange's other large institutional neighbor, Duquesne University, both opposed landmarking the building, while Rick Schweikert and his co-investors in PFEX, Inc. did not.

Jerpe Commission Company purchased eggs and cream from local farmers which they processed and sold. In 1905, Swanson bought the company from Jerpe under a partnership with John Hjerpe and Frank Ellison. They operated a commission business hauling eggs, milk and poultry they bought from local farmers and selling them to the grocery stores and hotels in Omaha, Nebraska. The enterprise was eventually incorporated. Frank Ellison died in 1918 and John Hjerpe in 1928. After John Hjerpe's death, Swanson became the sole owner of the corporation. By 1938, the Swanson enterprise was one of the larger creameries in the United States and during World War II became a major supplier of poultry and egg products to the U.S. military. In 1945, the company's name was officially changed to C.A. Swanson and Sons. After Carl Swanson died in 1949, his two sons, Gilbert Carl (1906-1968) and W. Clarke Swanson, took over the company.

Walmer Bridge was once home to a large working mill which was working during the early 1900s. The factory closed in 1931 due to lack of funds. Three decades later, it was controlled demolition, in 1979. It is now a sheltered housing estate called Old Mill Court. The West Lancashire Railway used to run through some parts of the village. Little Hoole Primary School is situated on Dob Lane, however it used to be located on the corner of School Street where it was opened in the 1930s.

It had several unusual features, principally a single central float and an inverted vertical stabilizer and rudder, and showed promise, but at that time no new aircraft were being ordered in numbers for the RAF and only the three Puffins of the initial order were built. Design and development The Parnall Puffin was a two-seat fighter-reconnaissance aircraft built just after World War I. Like the Fairey Pintail, it was designed to meet RAF Specification XXI, issued in May 1919 for an experimental amphibious aircraft that could operate from land, carrier decks or the sea. In many regards, the Puffin was a conventional single-engined biplane of its day, but it had two unusual features: a single, central float (the first British aircraft with this seaplane configuration) and a vertical stabilizer and rudder mounted below the fuselage. The under- mounted vertical stabilizer and rudder, intended to maximise the gunner's field of fire, was also used on the Pintail, and earlier by the Hansa- Brandenburg seaplanes. In the days of tailskid undercarriages for landplanes, such a layout could only be used by seaplanes with floats long enough to sit on the water almost in flying position with the tail well clear of the surface. The Puffin was a two-bay biplane, its parallel chord, equal span wings having stagger but no sweep; they could be folded for storage. Both upper and lower wings had ailerons. The interplane gap (the distance between the upper and lower wings) was large and the fuselage was mounted high in it, with its top just below the upper wing and its bottom well above the lower one. The fuselage was built up on the standard four longerons, making it flat sided and bottomed, but the top surface had the usual rounded decking. Aft, the lower longerons curved upwards, decreasing the fuselage depth. The tailplane was fixed to the upper longerons and carried a single elevator surface, mounted on off-set hinges to provide aerodynamic balance. The long chord vertical stabilizer and its unbalanced rudder, with a rounded trailing edge would have looked completely at home on top of the fuselage; fitted underneath, its appearance was perhaps more startling than the arrangement on the Pintail, where the rudder was low topped but fuselage mounted, and the vertical stabilizer very cropped. The pilot sat in an open cockpit beneath the upper wing's trailing edge, where a cut-out improved visibility. It was generally agreed the all-round view was good. Control surfaces operated via a two-speed gear system to optimise them for fast and slow flying. The pilot had control of a fixed forward firing Vickers machine gun. The gunner behind him, whose need for an excellent field of fire had determined the tail arrangement, had the standard Scarff ring mounted Lewis gun of the time. The Puffin was powered by a 450 hp (336 kW) geared down Napier Lion II engine, a 12-cylinder unit with three banks of four cylinders in W or broad arrow arrangement. The radiator for the water-cooled engine was immediately in front of the engine and benefited from airflow from the two-bladed propeller. The electric starter used an internal battery. The single central float was wide and stretched aft to below the leading edge of the fin. It joined to the fuselage around the wing roots with two pairs of struts. The wheels were linked by an axle that rode in a vertical slot in the float at its deepest point, and a hand driven screw enabled them to be raised or lowered. The aft-most part of the float was hinged so it could lift up and down and provided with a tailskid and a vertical shock absorber to the fuselage. At the extreme rear was a water rudder. Two deep and wide chord floats were fitted below the outer interplane struts to provide lateral stability on the water. Operational history Three Puffins were built, the first made its maiden flight from the Marine and Armament Experimental Establishment at the Isle of Grain in the hands of Norman Macmillan on 19 November 1920. Flight tests revealed one problem that was never satisfactorily solved: the Puffin was tail heavy and increasing tail incidence seems not to have helped. Other problems came from the float. The first prototype had a float that was short at the front, which in rough water produced so much spray that it destroyed the propeller and damaged the radiator. It was therefore lengthened, with an upward curving section, and reinforced with an extra pair of struts to the engine mounting. This reduced the problem but did not cure it, so another float, with a re-profiled cross- section was introduced which behaved much better. The third prototype used a float incorporating these features but with a flat top, which further improved water handling. The wheeled undercarriage behaved well, and allowed true amphibious use, in contrast to the troublesome Pintail arrangement. Despite its promise, the Puffin was produced at a time when there was no hope of orders for any aircraft for the RAF. Indeed, the RAF itself was under threat and that situation did not change until about 1923. The three Puffins were used for experimental work at the Isle of Grain.

Resnick filed suit to punish Omnicare for Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Omnicare allegedly paid kickbacks to nursing home operators in order to secure additional business. \\"If nursing homes take kickbacks, decisions they make about drugs for their residents ultimately may be based on financial benefits to the nursing homes rather than medical benefits for their patients,\\" Resnick said after a settlement was reached in 2010 with two nursing chains he sued.

Sued for illegally paying kickbacks to the owners of Total Pharmacy, Omnicare agreed to settle the suit by paying $17.2 million to the federal government. Nursing home owners the Esformes family, who sold their share in Total Pharmacy to Omnicare in return for the kickback, agreed to pay the government $5 million. Total Pharmacy provides pharmacy services to institutions such as nursing homes. The terms of the acquisition were in violation of federal and state laws. Omnicare previously settled a complaint with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stemming from the deal for $98 million. Nehls was a vice president of Total Pharmacy and Resnick was to the deal eir 2007 lawsuit alleged that the price paid by Omnicare for Total, $32 million,as greatly inflated by the kickback paid to the Esformes family. As part of the deal, the Esformes family signed a 10-year pharmacy contract with Omnicare for their chain of nursing homes. Such kickbacks constitute Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Under federal whistleblower laws, the plaintiffs will receive 28% of the Omnicare recovery (worth roughly $4.8 million) and 25-30% of the recovery from the Esformes family (worth from $1.25 million to $1.5 million). The Esformes family also agreed to pay almost $1 million in the plaintiffs‚Äô attorneys' fees. The settlement, which was reached days before suit was scheduled to go to trial, did not include an admission of wrongdoing by the Esformes family. Restitution In 2009, Resnick, decided to use substantial part of his $3.1 million award from his first Omnicare whistleblower lawsuit to pay restitution to the U.S. government for his role in the 2002 Universal Federal Savings Bank failure. Through an unprecedented arrangement worked out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Resnick‚Äôs restitution was forwarded to Universal‚Äôs former employees and depositors. Not only has everyone who lost money when the bank failed been made whole, but, as the Chicago Journal reported, Resnick‚Äôs restitution is also being given to ‚Äúregular bank customers who didn‚Äôt lose a penny when Universal collapsed.‚Äù The FDIC says this case marks the first time in history that the U.S. government has received restitution money after it had closed receivership on a failed bank.Ten Years After a Bank Collapsed, Former Customers Are Getting Their Money Back And More ‚Äì Chicago Journal Malpractice lawsuit Resnick also sued the Chicago law firm of Neal, Gerber and Eisenberg for legal malpractice over a multi-million dollar contract dispute alleging that they represented both Resnick and the contracting party.

According to the 2003 census, the town had a population of 866. Geography Vusanje is located within the Plav municipality, below the town of Gusinje. It is located in the geographical region of Prokletije mountain, in the basin of the Lim river. There is a notable waterfall Grlja. History The village was settled by ancestors of the Kelmendi region of Albania, by Gjonbalaj and Nick Bala family. Until 1912, it was part of Ottoman Empire. During the First Balkan War in 1912 it became part of the Kingdom of Montenegro. The village is made up of two settlements, Katundi i siper (upper village) and katundi i ulet (lower village). Also there is a hamlet called Zarunic. Post 1913, the village was subjected to repression and discrimination from the Montenegrin and Yugoslavian governments. The result was the expulsion of the 90% of the population to the USA, mostly in the New York area. The remaining population is now 100 % Albanian. It has also called Vusenje' and Vu≈°anje. The resident inhabitants call it Vuthaj. There is an old cemetery in the village, called \\"the Catholic cemetery\\". Culture There are two mosques in the village (1990). Anthropology The village is Albanian-inhabited, one of three Kelmendi settlements along with Martinaj Martinoviƒái and NokshiqNov≈°iƒái, in the Upper Polimlje region (1958).

They first appear during the rule of Duke Richard II of Normandy, in the early 11th century, and they would hold L'Aigle for the Norman Dukes and Kings of England until the first half of the 13th century, when with the fall of Normandy to the French crown the last of the line was forced to abandon the ancestral French lands, only to die in England a few years later without surviving English heirs. Their position on the borderlands, and near the headwaters of three rivers, the Risle, Iton and Avre, gave their small holding a special importance, as did a set of marriage connections that provided this relatively minor Norman noble family with a more elevated historical visibility.Kathleen Thompson, \\"The Lords of Laigle: Ambition and Insecurity on the borders of Normandy\\" in Anglo- Norman Studies; XVIII; ed. Christopher Harper-Bill, Woodbridge, 1996, pp. 178, 199 Having been neighbors and benefactors of the Abbey of Saint-Evroul, the family receive mostly-favourable coverage in the 12th century chronicle of Orderic Vitalis.Marjorie Chibnall, The World of Orderic Vitalis: Norman Monks and Norman Knights, Boydell Press, 1984, p. 26 Foundation and initial rise The earliest known member of the family was Fulbert de Beina, who built a castle 'in the time of Duke Richard', hence before that duke's death in 1026.Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, trans. Thomas Forester, Vol. I (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1853), p. 393 The location of his origin, as represented by his toponymic Beina, remains unidentified and it is not possible to definitively identify him among the several men named Fulbert appearing at the ducal court. Fulbert's son, Engenulf, lord of L'Aigle, was a benefactor of the local religious houses at Saint-Evroul and Saint-Sulpice-sur-Risle, their own foundation. To the former, he and his wife, Richeroeda, donated the warhorse of their eldest son, Roger, following his death,Thompson, 1996, pp. 179-80 Engenulf only appears with the Norman Duke in a document from Fecamp, just prior to the Norman conquest of England, in which Engenulf became the only prominent Norman nobleman to be killed at the Battle of Hastings.Thompson, 1996, p. 180 His sister Hiltrude married another prominent local baron, William fitz Giroie, while Engenulf's son and successor, Richer, married Judith, daughter of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches, indicating a rise in the family's standing among the Norman nobility. Richer, the new lord of L'Aigle, was unable to capitalize on his father's sacrifice, his family only holding two English manors in 1086, Witley and Mildenhall, and unlike many Norman families, the L'Aigles did not shift their center of power to England. Richer did appear at the royal court in 1081 and a brother, Robert, would serve the Anglo-Norman noble, Robert de Tosny of Belvoir. Like his father, Richer died fighting for William the Conqueror at the Siege of Saint-Suzanne in 1084, where his brother Gilbert of L'Aigle led a revenge assault in January 1085. As 'Gilbert de Aquila', this famous Norman knight would feature in Rudyard Kipling's tale, \\"Old Men at Pevensey\\", part of his Puck of Pook's Hill.Thompson, 1996, p. 177 He was given the castle of Exmes by Robert Curthose in 1089. Under the leadership of two Gilberts, Richer's brother and son of the same name, the family would continue to support the Norman dukes, though it becomes difficult to distinguish the two prior to the death of the elder Gilbert, killed at Moulins-la-Marche in an ambush by vassals of Geoffrey, Count of Mortagne, in what may have been a kidnap and ransom scheme gone awry. To prevent bloody reprisals, Count Geoffrey offered his daughter Juliana in marriage to the younger Gilbert, Richer's son.Kathleen Thompson, Power and Border Lordship in Medieval France: The County of Perche, 1000-1226 Boydell Press, 2002, p. 50Thompson, 1996, p. 182 This marriage would provide the family with a web of prominent connections that included the King of Navarre and Aragon, who was the bride's first cousin. The family also married again into the Anglo-Norman nobility, perhaps through the influence of Richer's wife Judith and her brother, Hugh, Earl of Chester, their daughter Matilda would marry Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, later divorcing the disgraced Earl and taking his lands with her into a second marriage with a royal favourite, Nigel d'Aubigny.Thompson, 1996, pp. 184-5 Gilbert, lord of L'Aigle, would serve successive Norman dukes, first Robert Curthose, then following his departure, William II of England, who would leave him to garrison Le Mans after its capture. With the latter's death, Gilbert is found both in England with Henry I and in Normandy with Robert, but an ongoing squabble between his brother-in-law, Count Rotrou of Mortagne, and the latter's kinsman, Curthose's ally Robert de Belleme, seems to have driven Gilbert firmly into the king's camp, and Henry would meet with Archbishop Anselme at L'Aigle in 1105. Gilbert became the agent of Henry I of England in Normandy after the king succeeded in wresting it from his brother the next year.Thompson, 2002, p. 55 His loyalty to the king was also rewarded by the grant of lands in England, in the Rape of Pevensey.Thompson, 1996, p. 184 His death occurred on a 15 May, the year being not precisely known, but after 1114 and before 1118. His younger brother, Richard had by 1089/90 joined the Norman adventurers in Italy, and would there become duke of Gaeta and count of Suessa,Thompson, 1996, p. 184 dying in 1111. Decline Richer, lord of L'Aigle, would succeed his father in their lands in Normandy, but King Henry had other plans for the family's Pevensey holdings, intending to give them to Richer's brothers, Engenulf and Geoffrey. Richer, for his part, threatened to turn L'Aigle over to King Louis VI of France if the English king would not give him his father's English possessions,Thompson, 2002, pp. 65-6 and about the same time he dabbled in supporting William Clito's claim to Normandy.Thompson, 1996, p. 188 In spite of the threatened betrayal, Henry still refused to allow Richer to inherit the English lands, but was brought around when Richer's uncle, Count Rotrou, hinted that were he to support the L'Aigle lord, Henry risked losing his Norman southern marches. Receiving his English inheritance, Richer backed out of his plan to surrender L'Aigle to Louis, but the French king then took it by force, apparently in 1118, and it was only a year later that Henry was able to take it back. L'Aigle was restored to Richer, again through Rotrou's influence, but the young lord had lost the king's confidence and would only appear at court once during the rest of Henry's reign.Thompson, 1996, p. 187 It was presumably during a visit to administer his English lands that he stayed with Gilbert Becket and became friends with the latter's son, the future Archbishop Thomas Becket, who perhaps even served as Richer's notary. Richer primarily involved himself in local Norman affairs, joining his neighbor Eustace de Pacy in his struggles over the lands around Breteuil, and in the process ravaging Saint-Evroul lands and attracting the vitriol of its chronicler, Orderic.Thompson, 1996, p. 189 The dispossessed brothers, Engenulf and Geoffrey, would die in 1120 in the wreck of the White Ship along with Rotrou's son and wife, and the Count would leave his County of Perche in the hands of his sister Juliana, Richer's mother, and turn his attention to fighting Muslims in Aragon.Thompson, 2002, p. 71 There in 1130 he would arrange the marriage of Richer's sister, Margaret, to a royal scion, Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez, lord of Monz√≥n, who was soon to become King of Navarre. With the succession of King Stephen and his struggle to solidify his southern Norman frontier, Richer was again to gain royal access, and again the relationship with Rotrou paid dividends. Henry had built frontier castles in the region, bypassing L'Aigle and the untrustworthy Richer in the process, but Stephen granted two of these to Rotrou and his nephew, with Richer receiving Bonsmoulins.Thompson, 2002, p. 79Thompson, 1996, p. 187-8 Richer was in England in 1139 recruiting troops for Stephen, and was again headed for England in 1140 when he was set upon, taken captive and imprisoned at Breteuil by another of Stephen's men, Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, as a result of a private dispute, Robert having received the lands confiscated by Henry from Richer's ally, Eustace de Pacy. In spite of his uncle Rotrou's intercession on Richer's behalf, a weakened King Stephen did not have the power to force his release.Thompson, 2002, p. 82 Rotrou then turned to Stephen's ascendant Angevin rivals, only to see a reversal of fortune that restored Stephen's control. Though Richer was released, a resentful Stephen deprived him of his lands in Sussex.Thompson, 1996, p. 190 In 1152, Richer alienated another prince, the Angevin Henry, apparently by supporting another scheme of French king Louis. Henry burned Bonsmoulins and took hostages. To make matters worse, the next year Henry was named Stephen's heir, and thus a new king brought Richer no respite from royal displeasure.Thompson, 1996, p. 190 Richer seems to have reached a rapprochement with the new king in the late 1050s, surrendering Bonsmoulins but again holding at least a portion of his lost English lands, though he largely disappears from royal records. He also appears also to have reached accommodation with his former captor, the Earl of Leicester, but this led to additional misfortune: Richer appears to have sided with the Earl's successor in the rebellion of Henry the Young King, and thereby again lost his Sussex land. They were again restored in 1174. His death in 1176 brought an end to a career that had squandered his father's power and royal good will through a particular penchant for choosing the wrong side in one conflict after another.Thompson, 1996, pp. 190-1 Richer, lord of L'Aigle, the son of Richer and his wife Beatrix, would succeed his father, but he and his wife Odelina left little documentary record. He appears to have spent his time primarily in and around his Norman lands. He disappears from English scutage records in the mid-1180s, and is thought to have died about 1186.Thompson, 1996, pp. 191-2  End  Gilbert, lord of L'Aigle, son of Richer and Odelina, would go a good way toward recovering the family's status in one swipe, when as follower of William of Salisbury, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, he would marry the earl's niece, a rich and well-connected widow, Isabel de Warenne, daughter of Hamelin de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, King Henry's half-brother, and Isabel de Warenne, Countess of Surrey, heiress to one of the most powerful Anglo-Norman families. She brought with her her own lands as well as the dower right to those of her first husband, Robert de Lacy, lord of Pontefract.Thompson, 1996, p. 192 In addition, Gilbert found favour with the new king, John, who succeeded in 1199. This royal access would be short-lived, as John almost immediately struggled to retain control over his kingdom, and when Gilbert left the royal court without permission to go defend his Norman lands, John confiscated his property in England. Gilbert's English holdings would be rescued through the intervention of Gilbert's brother-in-law, William de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, who pledged 3000 marks hold Gilbert's lands during his absence, and when Gilbert finally returned to England about 1215, he resumed possession.Thompson, 1996, p. 193 However, things came to a head in 1216. Gilbert had married his daughter, Alice, to John de Lacy, Constable of Chester, who was one of the leaders of the opposition to King John, and when control of Pevensey castle was given to the Earl of Arundel, Gilbert turned to the rebels in their attempt to make the French ruler Louis VIII king. Negotiations to bring Gilbert back into the royalist fold following the death of John and succession of Henry III came to nought, though Gilbert managed to retain control of his properties after Louis' 1217 defeat.Thompson, 1996, pp. 193-4 However, the fall of most of Normandy to the French left him with land in two separate kingdoms ruled by mutually-hostile monarchs.

The Moscow Times. 15 July 2012. Retrieved 16 July 2012. The Soyuz remained docked to the ISS throughout the mission to serve as an emergency escape vehicle. The launch also coincided with the 37th anniversary of the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project. Soyuz TMA-05M successfully returned to Earth on 19 November 2012. Crew  Backup crew  Launch The Soyuz TMA-05M mission lifts-off to the ISS on 15 July 2012. Soyuz TMA-05M was launched atop of a Soyuz FG rocket at 2:40 GMT on July 15, 2012 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. Following the flawless launch, the Soyuz spacecraft successfully achieved orbital insertion 9 minutes later and began its 34-orbit journey to the Space Station. Docking The spacecraft shortly before docking with the ISS on 17 July 2012. As part of its phasing maneuvers to catch up with the ISS, 3.5 and 4.5 hours into the mission, the Soyuz Spacecraft performed two large SKD Main Propulsion System Burns changing the vehicle's speed by 41.5 m/s and 23.9 m/s, respectively. These burns were followed by a minor maneuver on July 16 for a velocity change of two m/s. The on time automated docking sequence began at 2:31 GMT on July 17, 2012. The Crew activated the KURS Navigation System that provides accurate range and velocity data for the spacecraft's on-board computers. The station crew of Padalka, Revin and Acaba got up early changing their sleep cycles to support the rendezvous and docking operations of the Soyuz. Although the rendezvous and docking sequence is fully automated, cosmonaut Malenchenko and Russian mission controllers in Korolev, Moscow monitored the systems as well. As Soyuz TMA-05M approached the ISS, the spacecraft completed a series of trajectory correction maneuvers. At a range of 8 Kilometers to the space station, the Soyuz activated its TV system needed for automated operation monitoring. At a distance of 300 meters to the space station, Russian flight controllers issued a \\"GO\\" for the Flyaround to align Soyuz TMA-05M with the docking port on the Rassvet Module. With the Flyaround completed, a short period of Stationkeeping was initiated at a range of 190 meters. The opportunity gave the flight controllers a chance to check the Soyuz systems and the alignment with the docking port. The crew was given a \\"GO\\" and the final approach commenced at 4:40 GMT. Soyuz TMA-05M completed a successful docking at 4:51 GMT while the space station was flying high above North-East Kazakhstan: one minute earlier than planned. Shortly after, the docking probe was retracted and hooks started closing to establish the hard mate. The hard mate was followed by the standard one-hour leak check operations. After leak checks were completed, the crew opened the hatches and floated into the ISS. The arrival of Malenchenko, Williams and Hoshide on board Soyuz TMA-05M restored the space station's crew to full strength at six. Return to Earth Soyuz TMA-05M undocked from the ISS on 18 November 2012 at 10:26 PM (GMT), carrying Hoshide, Malenchenko and Williams, and landed safely at 1:53:30 AM (GMT) the following day. A source at Energia told the Novosti news agency that the location was 51¬∞.05 N, 67¬∞.16 E in Kazakhstan, about 4.7 km from the aim point. Confusion during the NASA TV broadcast of the event led to some, including NASA's own Media Services, recording the landing time incorrectly as 01:56. The spacecraft's departure marked the end of Expedition 33 and the start of Expedition 34.

Jianqiao air force base was then consolidated in 1931 in wake of the Mukden Incident by the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China , and was a location of major air battles between the Chinese air force and the Imperial Japanese air forces during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì45); battles scenes of Jianqiao which were re- enacted in a motion-picture patriotic war drama Heroes of the Eastern Skies (or Heroes of Jianqiao). In 1956 it was converted to a public airport and civil flights started on January 1, 1957. The airport was expanded in 1971 in preparation for the official visit of President Richard Nixon of the United States. In 1990 the runway was again lengthened and widened to 3,200 meters long and 50 meters wide. The airport handled 2,167,400 passengers in 1999, and served 46 routes in 2000 before all civil flights were transferred to the newly built Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport.

Datuk Seri Ahmad Said Hamdan, Ketua Suruhanjaya, Suruhanjaya Pencegahan Rasuah Malaysia and Others was a case decided in the High Court at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia in 2009. The High Court for the first time defined the meaning of the phrase \\"day to day\\" in law, applying it specifically to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act. Ruling that \\"day to day\\" refers to general office hours, the High Court held that it was illegal to interrogate suspects or prisoners during the night time, and that doing so violated Article 5 of the Constitution, which protects personal liberty. Background Tan Boon Wah is a Municipal Councillor for Kajang. On 15 July 2009, Tan and Selangor state government aide Teoh Beng Hock were brought by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to their Selangor headquarters for questioning in connection with allegations of graft against the Selangor government. Both Tan and Teoh were interrogated late into the night. After Tan's interrogation concluded in the early hours of 16 July, the MACC told him to go home and return for further questioning at 11 in the morning. Tan decided to stay overnight at the MACC office. Teoh, who was also sleeping there, later fell to his death from the MACC office block; his death is the subject of an ongoing inquest. Teoh's case prompted the announcement of a Royal Commission of inquiry into the MACC's investigation procedures, to be formed after the conclusion of the inquest. Tan alleged that the MACC had detained both him and Teoh overnight, and that this was a violation of their civil liberties. Tan filed suit against the MACC in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 22 July, claiming that the phrase \\"day to day\\" in Section 30 (3) (a) of the MACC Act permits interrogation during regular office hours, and not 24-hour interrogation. Although there was dispute as to whether Tan and Teoh were actually detained, and the specific hours during which they had been interviewed, the MACC submitted that it had interrogated Tan from 9.45pm on 15 July to 2.53am on 16 July, and this was accepted by Tan for the purposes of the case. He was represented by Karpal Singh. The MACC was represented by senior federal counsel Noorin Badaruddin. Judgment On 19 November 2009, Judicial Commissioner Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof handed down his judgment. The ruling noted that the MACC Act itself does not define the term \\"day to day\\", which appears in section 30 (3) (a): The meaning of the term was as such subject to judicial interpretation. Relying on the Oxford English Dictionary, Mohamad Ariff stated: \\"Looking at the definition under the Oxford Dictionary 'day to day' means daily. It does not mean 24 hours a day but at any time of the day. Hence, it should mean within normal working hours as stipulated between 8.30am and 5.30pm.\\" Mohamad Ariff rejected the argument that \\"day to day\\" could permit \\"round the clock\\" interrogation, stating that this would \\"offend the legislative purpose\\" of the law, and violate the fundamental liberties of the person as guaranteed by Article 5 of the Constitution, citing the recent case of Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor, where the Federal Court held that constitutional liberties must be read in the \\"widest sense\\" possible. Mohamad Ariff thus held that Tan had suffered false imprisonment, and ordered the MACC to pay damages for the time between 9.45pm and 2.53am during which Tan had been detained. The specific damages will be calculated by the High Court senior assistant registrar. Response Tan welcomed the decision, saying: \\"What is important is that no one should be subjected to such interrogation late at night. This is a victory for all Malaysians.\\" His lawyer, Karpal, called the ruling a landmark decision: \\"This affects across the board every investigation in the country; every police investigation and even the Criminal Procedure Code. ... For the first time, we get a definitive ruling to the phrase 'day to day'.\\" Karpal approvingly cited the Lock-Up Rules, which only allow the interrogation of prisoners between 6.30am and 6.30pm, and noted that the decision meant Teoh's family could sue the MACC for his false imprisonment as well. According to Karpal: Democratic Action Party Parliamentary leader and former Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang publicly lamented that \\"Teoh Beng Hock would not have died if MACC had followed the law\\" and interrogated him during the day. Noorin Badaruddin, acting for the MACC, told the press that she had received instructions from the Attorney General to appeal the decision.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.  History  The lot on which the Negaunee State Bank Building currently sits was previously home to the Mitchell Building, constructed in 1873 for Captain John P. Mitchell for use as a bank and office building. The construction, however, was ill-timed: due to the Panic of 1873 the planned bank was never incorporated and the structure was used only as a general commercial building. Then, in 1881, a private bank rented space in the building, and in 1887 the First National Bank of Negaunee was established and moved into the Mitchell Building. The First National Bank of Negaunee moved out in 1907, and in 1909 the newly organized Negaunee State Bank moved into the building, which was now known as the \\"Old Bank Building.\\" The Old Bank Building was destroyed by fire on January 3, 1912.Negaunee State Bank Building from the state of Michigan. Retrieved 11/18/2009 The Negaunee State Bank quickly purchased the lot from the Mitchell estate and began construction on the current building on the same site in 1912. The bank hired D. Fred Charlton of Marquette to design the new building, and moved in when construction was complete. The building housed the Negaunee State Bank until 1933, when the bank failed during the Great Depression due to both the national economic conditions and the embezzlement of funds by an employee. Following the failure of the Negaunee State Bank, the building housed a series of businesses, primarily insurance agencies and professionals, including lawyers, doctors and dentists. As of 2017, the building houses an antique store.  Description  Like the original Old Bank Building, the Negaunee State Bank Building has a triangular footprint, measuring 62 feet along the north (Iron Street) side, 102 feet along the southwest (Kanter Street) side, and 84 feet along the east wall side. The building consists of two stories, plus a basement intended for commercial space. The structure is framed of wood, with brick facing, siting atop a stone foundation. The exterior walls are painted; this may be original to the design of the building. Some portion of the walls of the original 1873 Old Bank Building were incorporated into the structure of the current building. The main entrance is located on the Iron Street facade, and gives access to both the bank area on the first floor and the offices on the second floor. A separate basement entrance is located at the corner of the building. On the interior, the first floor contains the white tile floor lobby and the banking area, a private office for the cashier, a directors' room, and two office suites. The first floor also contains the main bank vault and two small vaults in the offices. The second floor has nine office rooms, a store room, and two vaults\\\\ which are directly above those on the first floor. The basement contains a large commercial space, a storage area, and another large vault. The building has retained the original floor plan, floor coverings, woodwork and other ornamental building features.

(Anonymous, 18th century, Cusco School of Peru) Saint James the Moor-slayer () is the name given to the representation (painting, sculpture, etc.) of the apostle James, son of Zebedee as a legendary, miraculous figure who appeared at the also legendary Battle of Clavijo, helping the Christians conquer the Muslim Moors. The story was invented centuries after the alleged battle was supposed to have taken place. \\"Matamoros\\" is not a name nor an advocation of the saint. Aspects of the historical Battle of Monte Laturce (859) were incorporated into this legend of the battle of Clavijo, as Claudio S√°nchez-Albornoz demonstrated in 1948. Reprinted in Or√≠genes de la naci√≥n espa√±ola, III (Oviedo: 1975), pp. 281‚Äì311. Historian Jean Mitchell-Lanham says: \\"While this event is based on legend, the supposed battle has provided one of the strongest ideological icons in the Spanish national identity.\\" In the 17th century, followers of his cult (Santiaguistas) proposed the patronage of Spain under his name, in contrast to those who favored Teresa of √Åvila. The Santiaguistas overcame and won this religious debate, naming him the Patron Saint of Spain, until November 1760 when Pope Clement XIII rescinded this honor and officially declared the Immaculate Conception as the patroness of Spain as a country, and installed the historical apostle James as patron of the Spaniards. Origin Statue of James Matamoros, Mosque‚ÄìCathedral of C√≥rdoba, Spain The Christian king Alfonso II of Asturias died in 842 and was succeeded by his nephew, Ramiro I of Asturias. Meanwhile, in Christian circles, the legend grew that James, a disciple of Jesus, had gone to Spain, founded the Church there, and provided protection for the Christians. Historians have found no evidence for these old claims. Old bones that were discovered were venerated as his relics. The legend was that a battle took place. On Alfonso's death, the Moors demanded the reinstatement of the tribute of 100 virgins (fifty noble and fifty common), which Alfonso had defied. Ramiro denied them the tribute and prepared for battle. On the night before the Battle of Clavijo, he dreamt of St. James, who told him that God had chosen James as the patron for the Spanish kingdoms. According to the legend, James appeared as a warrior on his white horse with a white banner to help Christian armies of King Ramiro I in a battle against the Moors. The Christians marched on the cry of ¬°! \\"God save St. James!\\". They slew more than 5000 Muslims and James became known as \\"Matamoros\\". Adaptation in Spanish America The iconography of James Matamoros was used in the Spanish colonization of the Americas as a rival force to the indigenous gods, and protector of Spaniards from the indigenous peoples of the Americas. He was depicted as a conquistador. Namesakes Roman Catholic Church in the Mexican settlement of Matamoros, Coahuila. The Order of Santiago, a Spanish order of knighthood, originates from St. James' supposed involvement at the Battle of Clavijo. A wide number of Mexican settlements were named Matamoros by Spanish settlers in honor of their patron saint. Matamoros can also be found as a Hispanic family name, for instance Miguel Matamoros. Controversy In the 1620s Spain debated who should be the country's patron‚ÄîJames, the current patron, or a combination of him and the newly canonized Teresa of √Åvila. Teresa's promoters said Spain faced new challenges, especially the threat of Protestantism and the declining society at home, and needed a modern patron saint who understood these problems and could lead the Spanish nation back. Santiago's supporters (Santiaguistas) fought back viciously and won the day, but Teresa of √Åvila remained far more popular at the local level. The statue of James Matamoros at the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, one of the holiest pilgrimages of the Catholic Church, was reported to be slated for removal after the 2004 Madrid train bombings perpetrated by radical Islamists in an effort to seek harmony and understanding with the Muslim community in Spain and to prevent anger from the Arab-Muslim world. However, church officials reversed that decision to remove the statue following an outcry.

Munro commissioned the painting but did not like it. Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar (13 February 1797 - 22 November 1864) was a British art collector. Life H.A.J. Munro of Novar was born in London, the nephew of Hector Munro, 8th of Novar, and the son of Sir Alexander Munro (d. 1810). On his father's death in 1810 he became the head of the Munros of Novar and succeeded to the estate of Novar House in Ross-shire and inherited the Barony of Muirton in Morayshire. An elder brother was mentally unsound. He entered Christ Church, Oxford as a gentleman commoner in 1814 and left three years later with no degree. He was shy and, though a Tory, devoted himself more to art than to politics at a time when the Highland Clearances were a live issue and he evicted tenants from his estate of Culrain. The initial evictions were entrusted to three men: James Stewart who was a sheriff-officer along with William Munro and Andrew Tallach from the nearby township of Morangie. At the point of eviction in Culrain on 1 February 1820, Stewart was confronted by a crowd of 150 women who demanded that he hand over his papers, which he refused, but they took them off him anyway and they included 57 \\"notices of removal\\". When William Munro and Andrew Tallach appeared they were both forcibly detained by the women who were armed with \\"sticks and batons\\" according to Stewart. One of the women was punched by William Munro and fell on her back. William Munro then ran off being pelted with stones and Stewart and Andrew Tallach were then driven out of Culrain by the mob in a \\"mock triumph\\". Munro of Novar later arranged for a larger group of militia men which amounted to 100 strong and included armed ex-soldiers to enforce the removals. This group was also pelted with hand-size stones by the women on 2 March 1820 and failed to complete its objective. Munro of Novar later came to an agreement in which while Culrain would still be turned into a sheep farm, his tenants would not be evicted. However, this arrangement did not endure indefinitely and later in 1820 he cleared 500-600 people from his estate in Culrain to make way for sheep. Munro remained unmarried; among his several illegitimate children was Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro (b. 1819), the classical scholar. He died suddenly at Novar without leaving a will. His papers, though carefully kept by him, have not been preserved. Art collection and patronage Turner, The Lake of Zug, Metropolitan Museum, New York Munro was one of the most important patrons of J. M. W. Turner, as well as being the painter's close friend and (in 1836) traveling companion. He himself was a gifted amateur artist in the style of Greuze and exhibited in London. He commissioned Turner's paintings Venice from the Porch of Madonna della Salute (1837) and The Lake of Zug (1843), neither of which pleased him. He gave The Lake of Zug to John Ruskin, his rival as a collector of Turner, who records, \\"Mr. Munro thought the Zug too blue and let me have it.\\" On another occasion, Munro traded Fluelen: Morning Looking Towards the Lake (1845), another watercolor Swiss subject he had commissioned, for Storm in the St. Gotthard Pass: The First Bridge Above Altdorf (1845), which Ruskin had commissioned but disliked. Turner appointed him one of his executors in 1849. Curiously, a very distant kinsman of Munro's, Dr. Thomas Monro, had been one of the earliest supporters of the young Turner and, according to Ruskin, had exercised a significant influence on his art. Munro also collected works by the Old Masters, such as Raphael and Watteau, and by other contemporary British artists such as Richard Parkes Bonington, John Constable, William Etty, and Sir David Wilkie, amassing a collection of some 2,500 works by the time of his death. He displayed these in his houses in Mayfair, London, as well as at Novar. Auctions of the collection were held at Christie's between 1860 and 1878. His personal property had passed to his sister (Mrs Butler- Johnstone), and his real estate to his cousins, the Fergusons of Raith, who still own that.

The Howe run teams from Primary 3 level up to under-18 colts level. Many players have gone on to represent Fife, Caledonia, and Scotland at age grade level, with a handful going on to represent professional clubs. In 2007, current first XV Captain Chris Mason led the under-18 Howe of Fife squad to a unique treble winning both the school (as Bell Baxter High School) and the Club Scottish cups as well as the Scottish schools sevens cup. A number of the players involved in that team now play for the senior side. Howe Harlequins are the 1st XV Women's team, founded in 2014. The Duffus Park-based club have barely been in existence a few years but have been making massive strides in the women's game. In 2017, they won the BT National Division 2 Championship which promoted them into National 1. With the recent changes to the women's league names, they now start the 2018 season in the Tennent's Women's National League 1. The Harlequins originally got together as a way for women to keep fit through rugby. But with a competitive spirit growing, added to a developing skillset, the side started to play matches against other teams. Since then, the Harlequins haven't looked back. President Murdo Fraser paid tribute to the side after their title win. ‚ÄúOur women‚Äôs team have shown that anything is possible and we are all very proud of the team and what they have achieved,‚Äù he said at the time. In 2017 and 2018, the club was associated with the commemorations of the Battles of the Somme and Arras, including the Eric Milroy commemorative tournament. These Franco-Scottish events gave birth in February 2018 to the creation of the Auld Alliance Trophy, played every year as part of the six nations tournament. Suspensions In November 2017 several of the club's 1st XV men's team received 347 total weeks of suspension for incidents that took place the previous year in which a new player was sexually assaulted by having a bottle inserted into their anus after a match.

Plot  This film is set in Warsaw in the 1950s, with a few flash-forwards to present-day Warsaw. The main character is Sabina, a quiet, shy woman who has just turned thirty, and lives with her mother and ailing grandmother. Sabina lacks a man in her life, and her mother tries hard to find a husband for her. The grandmother, an eccentric lady with a sharp tongue from whom no secret can be concealed, also gets involved. Successive admirers arrive at their small, but tasteful apartment in an antebellum house, but Sabina shows no interest in any of them. One night, appearing out of nowhere, comes the charming, intelligent, and good-looking Bronislaw. Bronislaw is apparently interested in Sabina, and courts her, and Sabina falls hopelessly in love with him. But when Bronislaw reveals that he is a member of the secret police, and wants Sabina to spy on her boss at the state-run publishing house, things go from bad to worse to macabre. Sabina, her mother and her grandmother are fortunately up to the challenge, revealing a darker side to their otherwise affable personalities.

Pre-premiere screenings of Reverse at the oldest Warsaw cinema Wis≈Ça became the site of meetings of the Polish intelligentsia and ‚Äúhigh society\\", renewing a forgotten Polish tradition of spontaneous post-screening meetings and film discussions. In conjunction with an Oscar promotional campaign, Reverse was shown in New York City at MOMA and the Directors Guild of America Theatre. Reverse was also well received by American film critics as evidenced by reviews which appeared in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. The Polish Film Academy nominated Reverse for the Polish Film Awards: Eagles in 13 categories, eventually winning awards in eight of those, among them the Best Film Award. Reverse set a new record for the number of awards granted, surpassing the previous record held by Roman Polanski's The Pianist. Soon thereafter, awards began to appear on the international arena. Reverse received FIPRESCI Award at the Warsaw Film Festival; the St. George Award at the Moscow International Film Festival; as well as the Grand Jury Prize for Best New Director at the Seattle International Film Festival. The decision of the latter award was articulated by the jury as follows: ‚ÄúBorys Lankosz‚Äôs Reverse succeeds its substantial ambition to tell the story of love, family, and loyalty in a brutal post war Warsaw. Uniquely, first time director Lankosz manages to deliver a highly stylized vision without sacrificing character, story, or performance. We are happy and honored to give the best new director award to this touching, thrilling, and deeply human film.‚Äù  Awards  The film won five awards at the 2009 Polish Film FestivalReverse takes FIPRESCI prize at Warsaw 25th film festival Golden Lion *Best film (Borys Lankosz) *Producer of the best film (Jerzy Kapu≈õci≈Ñski) Individual awards * Best actress (Agata Buzek) * Best cinematography (Marcin Kosza≈Çka) * Best music (W≈Çodzimierz Pawlik) * Best supporting Actor (Marcin Doroci≈Ñski) * Best makeup (Miros≈Çawa Wojtczak, Ludmi≈Ça Krawczyk, Waldemar Pokromski) It also won the FIPRESCI award at the Warsaw Film Festival for the best Eastern European debut.Strong Competition for 34th Polish Film Festival * 2010 Eagle Award, Best Screenplay (Andrzej Bart) References  External links  Review * Review on Gazeta.pl 2009 films 2009 drama films Polish black-and-white films 2009 black comedy films Films set in the 1950s Films set in Warsaw Polish films Polish-language films Rape and revenge films 2009 comedy films Polish black comedy films ","title":"Reverse (film)"},{"id":"25135135","text":"Velekinca or Velekinc√´ is a village in the municipality of Gnjilane, Kosovo.

Judiciary system The judiciary is independent of the other branches. Judges are appointed for life and can only be removed for specific reasons established by law and only after formal court action has been taken. Before the mid-1990s, the law allowed for detention of suspects for 48 hours without judicial review and up to two years of detention during the course of a criminal investigation. Amendments to the law in 1994 required more stringent judicial review of pretrial and investigative detention. Criminal defendants are afforded a presumption of innocence, public trials, and jury trial for major offenses, as well as a number of other procedural rights. The drinking age is 16 and older if supervised. Life imprisonment Parole may be granted to certain inmates in Austria after 15 years' imprisonment, if prison officials are satisfied that the inmate will not re-offend. This is subject to the discretion of a criminal court panel, and a possible appeal to the high court. Alternatively, the President may grant a pardon following a motion of the Minister of Justice. If the President rejects the petition of clemency or pardon, the offender will be sentenced to imprisonment for a lifetime, and thus will spend the rest of their natural life in prison. Inmates who committed their crime when they were below the age of 21 cannot be sentenced to life imprisonment. Instead, juvenile offenders can only be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years imprisonment.

Ecuador experienced rolling blackouts for two to six hours per day that lasted from November 2009 until January 2010. Background The electricity crisis arose from Ecuador's worst drought in 40 years, which began in September 2009.‚ÄúDrought Blamed for Blackouts in Ecuador‚Äù. Latin American Herald Tribune (November 11, 2009).‚ÄúEcuador energy crisis cripples production, disrupts cities‚Äù. United Press International (November 17, 2009). Government experts attributed the drought to the El Nino phenomenon. Because of the drought, water levels at the Paute River dam‚Äîwhich normally supplies 40% of Ecuador's power‚Äîwere extremely low. The reservoir's water level is normally 1,991 meters above sea level, but on November 10 was only 1,968 meters above sea level. The minimum level is 1,965 meters. As of November 11, only two of the dam's 10 turbines were functioning. Normally, the dam can supply up to 1,000 megawatts (MW), but the dam's output was only 200 MW on this day. Effects Beginning November 5, rolling blackouts took place across Ecuador for two to six hours per day.Mercedes Alvaro. ‚ÄúEcuador Negotiates Emergency Electricity Imports With Peru‚Äù. The Wall Street Journal (November 9, 2009). Government officials also urged citizens to conserve energy. Economic losses from the blackouts are estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars; factory output slowed, and storage of perishables was disrupted. On November 6, the government declared an emergency in the power sector, which was expected to \\"allow the Finance Ministry to seek to guarantee fuel imports for thermoelectric plants\\". The government also agreed to purchase additional electricity from Peru and Colombia. Government officials aimed to end power rationing before Christmas.‚ÄúEcuador Aims to End Power Rationing Before Christmas‚Äù. Latin American Herald Tribune (November 17, 2009).

Around 1003, he and his family were attacked, dispossessed and captured by King Stephen I of Hungary (1000/1001-1038). The name \\"Gyula\\" also means a title. \\"Gyula\\" meant the second highest title in Hungarian tribal confederation.INSTITUTE OF HISTORY OF THE HUNGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES HISTORY OF TRANSYLVANIA Volume I. According to Gyula Krist√≥, his actual name was probably Prokui. However, certain historians like Istv√°n B√≥na disagree with this identification.  Family  Hungarian chronicles preserved contradictory reports of Gyula's family. According to the Gesta Hungarorum, Gyula, or \\"the younger Gyula\\",Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 27.), p. 65. was the son of Zombor and nephew of the elder Gyula. The same chronicle said that Zombor's grandfather, T√©t√©nyone of the seven chieftains of the Magyars, or Hungarians, at the time of their conquest of the Carpathian Basinhad defeated Gelou, the Vlach ruler of Transylvania, forcing Gelou's Slav and Vlach subjects to yield to him. Historian Florin Curta writes that the Gesta Hungarorum presented Gyula's family based on a local legend which \\"seems to have been blown out of proportions and linked to an earlier confusion between a family name and the name of a military rank [gyula] in the Magyar federation of tribes\\". Historian Gyula Krist√≥ says that the anonymous writer of the Gesta arbitrarily made a connection between the noble Gyula-Zombor kindred of Pest and N√≥gr√°d counties and the family of the gyulas of Transylvania when writing about Gyula's ancestors. Simon of K√©za's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum listed one Gyula among the seven chieftains of the conquering Hungarians, stating that \\"[a]lthough he came into Pannonia with the others, Gyula finally settled in Transylvania.\\"Simon of K√©za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 2.29), p. 83. Finally, the 14th- and 15th-century chronicles (including the Illuminated Chronicle) distinguished three Gyulas, among whom the first Gyulaone of the seven Magyar chieftains\\"found a great city which had been built in former times by the Romans\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 30), p. 100. while he was hunting in Transylvania. The great city is identified as Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (now Alba Iulia in Romania). The 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote of a Hungarian leader, titled gyula, who was second in rank among the leaders of the federation of the Hungarian tribes. The Byzantine historian, John Skylitzes mentioned a \\"chieftain of the Turks\\",John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History (ch. 11.5.), p. 312. or Hungarians, named Gylas, who was baptised in Constantinople around 952. Skylitzes also stated that Gylas \\"remained faithful to Christianity\\" and did not invade the Byzantine Empire after his baptism. One view is that Transylvania in the 10th century seems to have been an independent principality which was governed by a line of princes who were invariably called Gyula; they were the successors, and perhaps also the descendants, of the gyula who had been the military leader of the Hungarian tribal federation at the time of the conquest of the Carpathian Basin. Another view is that the family of the gyulas moved to Transylvania only after 970. The Romanian historian Vlad Georgescu argues that Gyula (Gyla) seems to have been of Pecheneg origin, since Byzantine sources speak of the existence of a Petcheneg tribe called Gylas; a life of the monarch-saint Stephen I also mentions battles with Pechenegs in the heart of Transylvania. Before he could be crowned king of Hungary in title and in fact, the young Prince Stephen, whose mother was Gyula's sister according to the almost contemporary Annales Hildesheimenses (‚ÄúThe Annals of Hildesheim‚Äù), had to battle to overcome rebellious lords led by, among others, his relative and rival Kopp√°ny. The Chronicon Pictum (\\"Illuminated Chronicle\\") narrates that Stephen inflicted a devastating defeat upon Kopp√°ny whose corpse was quartered. One quarter of Kopp√°ny's body was delivered to Gyula at his Alba Iulia (in Hungarian, Gyulafeh√©rv√°r ‚ÄòGyula‚Äôs White Castle‚Äô) residence in Transylvania. This quarter of the corpse was pinned to the gate of Alba Iulia. In 1003 (maybe in 1002 or 1004), Stephen, who had been crowned in 1000 or 1001, personally led his army against his maternal uncle, and Gyula surrendered without a fight. The Romanian historian Florin Curta suggests that the only contemporary source to mention Stephen's attack against ‚Äúrex Geula‚Äù is the Annales Hildesheimenses. On the other hand, Thietmar of Merseburg (975-1018) refers to another character (Procui) who was King Stephen's uncle and whose land was occupied by the king. Florin Curta argues that Procui cannot possibly be the same as Gyula: according to the 13th century Gesta Ungarorum, Gyula was captured by King Stephen I and kept in prison for the rest of his life; by contrast, Procui was expelled from his estates, given back his wife, and later appointed warden of a frontier fort by King Boleslav I of Poland. The name Procui is probably of Slavic origin.

He was also a sports editor with the Philadelphia Public Ledger. Biography Early life Maxwell was born in Chicago on September 7, 1884. He is known to have had a sister named Katerine Doust at the time of his death. Maxwell began his athletic career at Englewood High School. There he excelled in football and track and field. He also played the mandolin and was a student actor in the school's Shakespearean plays. College Before playing professional football, Maxwell played at the college level while attending the University of Chicago. He played for the Maroons in 1902, under coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, who recruited Maxwell for his size and style of play. Maxwell weighed 240 pounds, in an era when the average offensive lineman weighed under 200 pounds. Maxwell's struggle with a speech impediment made his physical presence less intimidating and in fact increased his popularity. He played guard for the Maroons in 1902 and 1903. He also competed for the school as a boxer and in track and field, later set the school's record in the hammer throw. On July 4, 1904, Maxwell set the school's shot put record, when he recorded a 42'9\\" throw. 1905 while attending Swarthmore College In the fall of 1904, Maxwell transferred to Swarthmore College. There he prompted the interest of the school's president, who personally encouraged him to improve his studies and even directed the college treasurer to send his tuition bills to a member of the Swarthmore College Board of Managers.http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/index3.html Swarthmore College History It was around this time that he was given the nickname \\"Tiny\\". According to Amos Stagg, Maxwell was called \\"Fatty\\" while attending the University of Chicago. During his two years at Swarthmore, the school's football team went 6-3 in 1904 and 7-1 in 1905, losing only to Penn. =The bloodied face photo= In 1905, 18 players died playing college football and 159 were seriously injured. During an October 7, 1905 game between Swarthmore College and Penn, played at Franklin Field, Maxwell's nose was broken, his eyes were swollen nearly shut and his face dripped with blood. However Maxwell reportedly continue to play until near the end of the game, when his face was so bloody and swollen that he could no longer see, yet he never complained of the physical beating. Because of his size, Penn had three linemen block Maxwell. Swarthmore lost the game to Penn 11-4. According to legend, a newspaper photo was taken of his face. The photo then found its way to President Theodore Roosevelt. The photograph of Maxwell's face shocked and enraged the President into threatening to abolish football, if the colleges themselves did not take steps to eliminate the brutality and reduce injuries. Fact vs. fiction Several writers and scholars have made exhaustive searches for the photo of Maxwell's battered face, but none has ever been found. Though the events surrounding the Roosevelt-Maxwell story supposedly occurred in 1905, the story didn't appear until it was mentioned in the second edition of Frank G. Menke's Encyclopedia of Sports published in 1944, 22 years after Maxwell's death. The 1960s and 1970s update of the Encyclopedia also continued to run the Maxwell-Roosevelt story. The Maxwell Football Club, formed by sportswriters and athletic officials to honor Maxwell, picked up the story and made it more credible. As a result, it became the official account of 1905 and was enshrined in Jack Falla‚Äôs history of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and is mentioned at the College Football Hall of Fame. What is absolutely certain is that on October 9, 1905, Teddy Roosevelt held a meeting of football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Though he lectured the group on eliminating and reducing injuries, he never threatened to ban football or mentioned the Maxwell injury. He also lacked the authority to abolish football and was in fact, a fan of the game. The President's sons were playing football at the college and secondary levels at the time. By December, sixty-two colleges agreed on a set of innovations that significantly changed the game of football. Yardage for a first down was changed from five to 10 yards; a neutral zone was established between opposing lines, and the time of the game was reduced from 70 to 60 minutes. The year also saw the legalization of the forward pass. =All-American honors= At the end of 1905 season two Swarthmore players were selected on Walter Camp's All-American team. One was their quarterback Wilmer Crowell, and the other was Maxwell. However Bob left Swarthmore in 1906 without receiving his degree. Pro football In the fall of 1906 Maxwell played professional football for the Massillon Tigers, later moving to the Canton Bulldogs of the Ohio League He then played for the Pittsburgh Lyceums after pro football disappeared from Ohio after the 1906 season. During this time, Maxwell insisted on wearing his Swarthmore jersey with its big \\"S\\" in all team pictures during his pro career. =1906 Canton-Massillon Scandal= In 1906 Maxwell was a figure in betting scandal between the Massillon Tigers and the Canton Bulldogs. The Canton Bulldogs-Massillon Tigers Betting Scandal was the first major scandal in professional football. It was the first known case of professional gamblers attempting to fix a professional sport. A Massillon newspaper alleged that Bulldogs coach Blondy Wallace and Tigers end Walter East conspired to fix a two game championship series between the two clubs. When the Tigers won the second and final game of the championship series and were named pro football's champions, Wallace was accused of throwing the game for Canton. However E. J. Stewart, the Tigers' coach and the editor of the Massillon Independent, charged that an actual attempt was made to bribe some of the Tiger players and that Wallace had been involved. His accusation was that an attempt had been made to bribe some Massillion players before the first game. According to Stewart, Tiny Maxwell and Bob Shiring of Massillon had been solicited to throw the first game by East. Maxwell and Shiring then reported the offer to the Tigers' manager and the scandal ended before it began. The scandal was said to have ruined professional football in Ohio until the mid 1910s. Coach In 1909, Maxwell became an assistant coach for Swarthmore College. He later accepted an assistant coaching job at Penn. While coaching, Maxwell also enrolled at Jefferson Medical College, located in Philadelphia where he completed his pre-clinical studies. However, he withdrew from the school after two years. As a student at Jefferson, Bob again played guard on the school's football team. Referee Because of his tremendous size, quickness, and knowledge of the rules, Maxwell was soon in demand to officiate major games as Harvard-Yale, Army-Navy and Pitt-Penn State. Walter Camp later said that Maxwell set the standard for fairness and competence. He also officiated several professional football games as well. Bob worked the famed Penn-Dartmouth game at the Polo Grounds in 1919, referred to as \\"The Bloodiest Battle of World War I\\". Lou Little, a Penn tackle who later coached at Georgetown and Columbia, said Maxwell alone prevented an open riot. In 1921, Maxwell served as the referee for a game between the Union Quakers of Philadelphia and the pre-National Football League, Frankford Yellow Jackets.http://home.comcast.net/~ghostsofthegridiron/Quakers2.htm/ Ghosts of the Gridiron =Notable officiating experiences= *During a Yale-Harvard game, Maxwell obstructed a Harvard tackler, preventing him from bringing down a Yale ball carrier. As Yale's players celebrated the resulting big gain, Maxwell told them, \\"Gentlemen of Yale, I fully expect to be invited to your annual banquet and be awarded my varsity 'Y.' I have j-just turned in the best Yale play of the day.\\" *During a Pitt-Penn State game, after Maxwell had followed a Pitt runner for the length of the field in a breakaway play against Penn State, the Nittany Lions' captain insisted that the Pitt back had stepped out of bounds at his own 10-yard line. He then asked Tiny to come back with him to Pitt's 10 yard line, he'd point out the cleat mark. Maxwell responded by saying as he panted \\"Young man,\\" if y-you want me to go back and look at that cleat mark, you'll have to hire me a t-taxi.\\" *During a match-up involving a Catholic and non-Catholic college, a lineman for the Catholic institution bit the finger of one of the players from the non-Catholic school. When the bitten player complained, Maxwell replied, \\"I'll tell you what to do. Next year schedule the game on a Friday, because they don't eat meat then.\\" Reporter In 1914, after a journalistic apprenticeship in Chicago as a reporter for the Chicago Record Herald, he began writing a sports column for the Philadelphia Public Ledger. Two years later Maxwell became sports editor of the Public Ledger, a position he held until his death. Maxwell's column was reported as being stylish and good humored. In friendly bet between Record Herald and a rival newspaper, Maxwell defeated his colleague in an eating contest. Death and legacy Early in the summer of 1922, Maxwell and some friends went for a drive in the countryside north of Philadelphia. As they were returning that night, Maxwell noticed a car stopped directly in front of him on the road.* Fearing a holdup, he sped up to go around the car and ran head-on into a truck that was taking a group of Boy Scouts home from a picnic. According to Nan Pollock, one of those in Maxwell's party, Maxwell was pinned beneath the wreckage. He told his friends to \\"Help the others! I can wait.\\" Maxwell spent the next few days in a hospital located in Norristown, Pennsylvania, where he was suffering from seven broken ribs, a punctured lung and a dislocated hip. Pneumonia developed, and delirium soon followed. On the night of June 29, Maxwell was visited by his neighbor and close friend, Charles Heeb. Emerging from his delirium he talked of packing his bags and going home. \\"Take two hours' sleep, and I'll go with you,\\" Heeb told him. Maxwell agreed and he drifted off to sleep where he later died. In 1937, the Maxwell Football Club was founded in Philadelphia to award trophies in his name and promote football safety. The Club also annually awards the Maxwell Award to the best college football player in the nation, as determined by a panel of sportscasters, sportswriters, and NCAA head coaches and the membership of the Maxwell Football Club. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974.

Zatoichi: On the Road is the fifth episode in the 26 part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi. Plot Ichi is being taken to Doyama, all expenses paid by an employee of Doyama crime boss Hikozo, on the promise of just meeting with Hikozo, no obligation to do anything. On the way his guide is killed by Hikozo's rivals who overheard Ichi and his guide at a tea house. Ichi kills them including the husband of Hisa, a woman who watches the short fight. She tells him this when he asks and they part coolly. At night he encounters a group of samurai looking for a girl. They leave and Ichi discovers the man they have just mortally wounded. He asks Ichi to protect a girl named Mitsu, the girl for whom the others are looking, and escort her to Edo (the capital, nowadays called Tokyo) where her family can protect her. He finds the exceptionally well-dressed girl hiding in a nearby shed. Ichi kills two men who come into the shed looking but another man escapes. Sometime during their travel Mitsu reveals that she is being hunted because she stabbed the local lord in the face with her hairpin when he tried to rape her. They reach an inn where Hisa is also staying with Jingoro, the man who hired Hisa's husband. Confessing to be low on cash, Ichi asks the proprietress if she can ask if anyone wishes for a massage so he can earn money to pay for the accommodation. Jingoro accepts so he can find out about Ichi. Ichi orders Mitsu not to leave their room. While giving the massage Hisa, whose presence Ichi detected, leaves the room. When asked if he is Zatoichi, Ichi denies this and says Zatoichi is a fool for having learned the sword as now people always want to kill him. Ichi senses the man going for his sword, he grabs it, wraps the sageo (cord around the sheath) around the handle so it can't be used and throws it across the room.and then gives a very hard massage for which he charges a huge amount. Meanwhile, Hisa has talked to Mitsu and convinced her of Ichi's ill intent. Hisa leaves with Mitsu. At the palanquin service, Hisa's insistence on haste alerts Tomegoro, the owner, who decides there is money to be made by taking the girl himself and he orders his men to cast Hisa out. Ichi finds Hisa in the street and learns that Jingoro works for Boss Tobei Shimozuma. Claiming to be there to give a massage, Ichi goes to the travel boss and asks about Mitsu but they try to throw him out. After this failure and a show of swordsmanship they return Mitsu to him. Back at the inn Ichi chastises Mitsu and reveals his hurt feelings that she mistrusted him. She apologises and flies into his arms. The next day the group of samurai are on the road looking for the girl with orders to kill her from their lord which one of them questions. While eating lunch Mitsu says she is happy for her hardships as without them she never would have met Ichi. As she reaches to wipe food from her face he violently grabs her hand and tells her to stay still and then despatches the three samurai who charge at them. Arriving at the next town Mitsu asks him to come with her so she can meet her family and when he is reluctant she gets him to confess that if he doesn't leave her now he will be unable to ever let her go which pleases her before he says he is joking. Even as she is sitting in her palanquin she begs him to visit. Sitting on a boat Ichi overhears that the two bosses are going to fight as Boss Hikozo has arrived home. Tomegoro goes to Doyama to see Hikozo and find Ichi and kidnap Mitsu. Ichi arrives at Hikozo's house. Hikozo asks Ichi for help and Ichi demurs, claiming false pretences, and Hikozo eventually offers the huge sum of 20 gold ryo which Ichi accepts as below his usual 30 only because of who they will fight. The young man, Matsu, who serves Ichi sake reveals he loves a girl named Mitsu. Hisa and another man waylay Mitsu on the road and take her to Boss Tobei. They plan to use her to control Ichi. Hikozo launches a dawn raid by boat and Shimozuma drags Mitsu out against Hisa's protests that taking a girl to a fight is wrong. Tobei lets Mitsu call out and orders Ichi out of the fight and he concedes, even to the point of returning his money and conferring with Tobei about killing the two bosses on the other side which is Tobei's main objective. Ichi starts the fight and in the confusion manages to isolate Tobei with Hikozo and Tomegoro and he kills all three. Other men arrive and flee in panic when Ichi faces them. He returns to the main street and when confronted by Matsu tells him to leave. Mitsu is unharmed, apparently with Hisa's help, and flies into Ichi's arms again. Tobei's men arrive in force with Jingoro, whom Ichi says deserves to die, and threaten Ichi. He gives money to Matsu to take Mitsu to the ferry. As they leave he calls them back and almost returns to her her kerchief which she dropped before he sent here away the first time but he changes his mind. Her then kills Jingoro and any man who approaches. Waiting on the road Matsu realises Mitsu is the girl that Ichi talked about fondly and that by giving them money Ichi was signalling that he wouldn't be with them. Ichi is seen walking off alone again.

Non-metallic minerals are in green (NaCl ‚Äî salt, GR ‚Äî graphite). Mining in Austria is an industry on the decline. After a period of postwar expansion, mineral production has stagnated in recent decades, and metals mining continues to decline, because of high operating costs, increased foreign competition, low ore grades, and environmental problems. All the metal mines in the country were closed, except an iron ore operation at the Erzberg mine (producing 1.8 million tons of iron ore and concentrate in 2000) and a tungsten operation at the Mittersill mine, which was the West's largest underground tungsten mine. Most of the growth in the mineral resources area was in the production of industrial minerals, the area in which future mining activities will most likely be concentrated, mostly for domestic consumption. Minerals Austria produces 2.5% of the world's graphite, ranking 10th in the world, and is one of the world's largest sources of high-grade graphite. In 2000, estimated output was 12,000 metric tons, down from 30,000 metric tons in 1996. The country produces 1.6% of the world's talc, ranking ninth, with a reported output in 2003 of 137,596 tons of crude talc and soapstone. The country's only producer of talc, Luzenac Naintsch AG, operated three mines, in the Styria region, and produced a range of talc, chloritic talc, dolomite talc, and chlorite-mica-quartz ores. Output of other minerals in 2003 output in metric tons, include: limestone and marble, 24,477,000 metric tons; dolomite, 6,079,000 metric tons, for the domestic cement industry, along with calcite and limestone; gypsum and anhydrite, 1,004,000 metric tons; brine salt, 3,422,000 cubic meters (salt mines are owned by the government, with plans to privatize the operations); tungsten, 1,400 tons; pumice (trass), 4,000 tons; and crude kaolin, 100,000 metric tons. Gold production in 2003 was 25 kg. Crude magnesite production was reported at 767,000 metric tons in 2003. Lignite production has been declining since 1963. In 2003, lignite production totaled 1,152,000 metric tons. Production of bituminous coal declined steadily after World War II, and in 1968 ceased altogether.

The test measures parameters such as riding time (seconds) or endurance. Some of the functions of the test include evaluating balance, grip strength and motor coordination of the subjects; especially in testing the effect of experimental drugs or after traumatic brain injury.  Rationale  In the test, a rodent is placed on a horizontally oriented, rotating cylinder (rod) suspended above a cage floor, which is low enough not to injure the animal, but high enough to induce avoidance of fall. Rodents naturally try to stay on the rotating cylinder, or rotarod, and avoid falling to the ground. The length of time that a given animal stays on this rotating rod is a measure of their balance, coordination, physical condition, and motor-planning. The speed of the rotarod is mechanically driven, and may either be held constant, or accelerated. A human analog to rotarod test might be treadmill running. Hamster, gerbil, and mouse owners can observe the principle in action when an animal climbs on the outside of its wheel, instead of inside of it. In the rotarod test, however, the rotation of the cylinder in experiments is mechanically driven. A rat rotarod apparatus  Scientific use  The advantage of this test is that it creates a discretely measurable, continuous variable (length of time) that can be used for statistical purposes to quantify the effects of different drugs, conditions, and procedures. This test does not use subjective judgments of ability, and inter-rater reliability will be virtually perfect. Inter-laboratory reliability will only be achieved if the various parameters (size of cylinder, speed of cylinder, composition material of surface, and amount of practice/training given the animal) are also replicated.Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 March 4; 100(5): 2917‚Äì2922 Assessment of genetic susceptibility to ethanol intoxication in miceNathan R. Rustay,*‚Ä† Douglas Wahlsten,‚Ä° and John C. Crabbe The experiment is also very replicable from lab to lab (ibid). Moreover, these parameters may be adjusted variously to optimize the statistical separation of different conditions. For instance, alcohol effects on mice become less apparent when the speed is increased.Rustay, N. R., Wahlsten, D. & Crabbe, J. C. (2003) Behav. Brain Res. Because of concern for impairment in human motor behavior from the use of prescription medications, the rotarod test is frequently used in early stages of drug development to screen out drugs that might later cause subtle impairments, which might not be detected epidemiologically in a human population for a very long time. The test may be useful as a sensitive indicator of trauma induced by brain injury to laboratory rats. Alcohol markedly impairs mouse performance in the rotarod test. Research using the rotarod test with various chemical agonists and antagonists may help scientists determine which components of neurons mediate the effects of chemicals. Testing of genetic knockout animals may help determine the genes most responsible for maintaining mammalian balance and coordination. Comparing the performance of different animals with specific brain lesions helps scientists map which structures are critical for maintaining balance.

Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 8 was sponsored by Republican State Senator Charles W. Bell from Pasadena, California. California Legislature, Final Calendar of Legislative Business, Thirty-Ninth Session (1911), p. 300. It was adopted by the California State Legislature and approved by voters in a referendum held as part of a special election on October 10, 1911. More details about the history of how this amendment was passed are available on the page detailing the timeline of the California women's suffrage movement. A list of California suffragists documents organizations as well as individuals who participated in the 1911 campaign. An earlier attempt to enfranchise women had been rejected by California voters in 1896, but in 1911 California became the sixth U.S. state to adopt the reform. Nine years later in 1920, women's suffrage was constitutionally recognized at the federal level by the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This amendment prohibited both the federal government and all of the states from denying women the right to vote.  Proposition 4 Election  Proposition 4 was narrowly approved by California voters with 50.7 percent support.California Secretary of State, Statement of Vote October 10, 1911, p. 4. Election evening results appeared to indicate that Proposition 4 would be defeated as there was strong opposition from the San Francisco Bay Area. However, late returns from the agricultural and rural parts of the state overcame majority opposition from Bay Area cities such as San Francisco and Oakland. The county with the highest level of support for Proposition 4 was the rural Modoc County (70.5% support). The county with the lowest level of support for Proposition 4 was San Francisco County (38.1% support). Other notable counties voting against giving women the right to vote included Marin County (41.6% support), San Mateo County (44.5% support), and Alameda County (45.4% support).California Secretary of State, Statement of Vote October 10, 1911, p. 4. The ballot argument in favor of Proposition 4 was written by Republican State Senator C.W. Bell and Republican Assemblyman H.G. Cattell, both from southern California. The ballot argument against Proposition 4 was written by Democratic State Senator J.B. Sanford from northern California.California Secretary of State, Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the State of California, with Legislative Reasons for and against Adoption Thereof, October 10, 1911 Special Election.  Controversial Editorials and Opinion Pieces Against Women‚Äôs Suffrage  In 1911, there were several controversial editorials and opinion pieces published by the Los Angeles Times against women‚Äôs suffrage, including Proposition 4. A Los Angeles Times editorial dated January 21, 1911, stated that ‚Äúwomen are incapable of physically dominating men. By their inferior physical strength they are unable to compete on an equal basis in any line of endeavor where ability is determined by sheer bodily prowess. All positions of physical power - such as in our police forces, our armies and our navies - will necessarily be filled by men. In other words the enforcement of all law must inevitably rest with men. No law or ordinance could be effectually upheld except through the willingness of men to uphold it. And no matter what words were written on the statute books of any State, if the physical power (which is the masculine power) behind it were withdrawn, the law would immediately become void and impotent. Therefore in equal suffrage we have the spectacle of women desiring to pass laws which they are physically incapable of upholding, and laws which they admit the men do not want.‚Äù A Los Angeles Times editorial dated August 19, 1911, stated that: ‚ÄúPossession of the ballot will not help woman, socially or industrially. It will make exactions upon her time and strength. It will invade the home and destroy its charm. It will not result in wiser laws or better government.‚Äù A Los Angeles Times editorial dated September 22, 1911, stated that: ‚ÄúThe working man - whether he be a Republican, a Democrat or a Socialist - who walks along Broadway or Spring Street on Saturday afternoon and sees thousands of fashionably-attired girls and women of mature age parading in autos and making woman-suffrage speeches says to himself, ‚ÄòAre these butterflies to be entrusted with the task of making laws for me?‚Äô‚Äù The editorial also stated that ‚Äú[t]he Times opposes woman suffrage because it does not believe in either the justice or the expediency of burdening the women of California with the duty of voting.‚Äù In a Los Angeles Times opinion piece dated October 1, 1911, Democratic State Senator J.B. Sanford, who was Chairman of the Democratic Caucus of California at the time, called women‚Äôs suffrage a ‚Äúdisease,‚Äù a ‚Äúpolitical hysteria,‚Äù a ‚Äúcruel and intolerable burden,‚Äù and a ‚Äúbackward step in the progress of civilization.‚Äù In the same opinion piece published by the Los Angeles Times, Democratic State Senator Sanford also used homophobic language in writing the following about certain classes of people who advocate women‚Äôs suffrage: ‚ÄúIt is the mannish female politician and the little effeminate, sissy man, and the woman who is dissatisfied with her lot and sorry that she was born a woman.‚Äù  1896 Rejection of Women‚Äôs Suffrage by California Voters  During the November 3, 1896 General Election, California voters rejected Constitutional Amendment No. 6 which would have given women the right to vote. The suffrage amendment was defeated by a double-digit margin with 44.6 percent support.California Secretary of State, Statement of Vote November 3, 1896, p. 15. Notable counties voting against giving women the right to vote included San Francisco County (26.1% support), San Mateo County (29.9% support), Marin County (30.8% support), Contra Costa County (37.7% support), Sacramento County (40.0% support), Sonoma County (40.4% support), Alameda County (40.7% support), and Santa Clara County (49.0% support).California Secretary of State, Statement of Vote November 3, 1896, p. 15. Both the Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle opposed Constitutional Amendment No. 6 which would have given women the right to vote.  Progressive Era of Reforms  Women's suffrage was a part of the Progressive Era of reforms. On the same election day that Proposition 4 was approved, voters enacted the modern system of direct democracy in California, by approving Proposition 7, which introduced the initiative and the optional referendum powers, and Proposition 8, which introduced the recall of public officials.  Constitutional Suffrage Reforms Excluded  While Proposition 4 gave women the right to vote in California, the proposition did not alter the existing discriminatory provisions in the California Constitution limiting the right to vote, including prohibiting natives of China from voting, prohibiting idiots from voting, and prohibiting persons from voting who are unable to read the constitution in the English language and write their name.California Secretary of State, Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the State of California, with Legislative Reasons for and against Adoption Thereof, October 10, 1911 Special Election.

The hierarchy of the ice hockey league system forms a pyramid with many regional minor and development leagues making up the base of the pyramid and a linear progression through the professional minor leagues leading to the National Hockey League at the top of the pyramid.  Major league professional hockey The National Hockey League (NHL) is widely considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world with top players from multiple countries participating in the league. It is one of the Big Four major North American professional sports leagues along with Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Football League. The NHL is a 'closed' league, meaning that teams are neither promoted nor relegated to other leagues, based on a franchise system. There are presently 31 teams in the NHL, with 24 located in the United States and 7 located in Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  Minor league professional hockey  There have been professional ice hockey leagues of varying levels since the invention of the sport, and over time the leagues in North America settled into an unofficial hierarchy. The top of this hierarchy, however, was codified in the most recent NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement. In the top two minor leagues, the American Hockey League and the ECHL, teams act as a development farm system for the major league and the players are represented by the Professional Hockey Players' Association. While players are often sent between major and minor league teams, the teams themselves are never promoted or relegated. As professional leagues, players are paid a salary. As with all minor leagues, the salaries are often much less than what the NHL pays, but in the AHL, compensation is higher than the overall median U.S. annual income, and accounting for room and board, ECHL compensation is comparable to the national average. Today, the 31 teams of the American Hockey League (AHL) are considered to be the highest-level minor league. All current AHL teams must have affiliation agreements with NHL teams, and many are owned by the same owners as the parent team. Most prospective NHL players will enter into a two- way contract, in which players can be sent between the NHL and AHL teams at will. Many AHL players enter the league after being drafted from juniors or college, or after being scouted and signed by an NHL team and being assigned to the affiliated team to develop as a player. The AHL also recognizes a 'standard contract', which signs a player directly to the AHL though the affiliated NHL team has negotiating rights and can upgrade a player to a two- way contract if they so desire. The ECHL, formerly known as the East Coast Hockey League, is considered a mid-level minor league with 25 teams within the United States and two in Canada. Most of the teams of the ECHL have affiliation agreements with NHL and AHL teams, although it is not a requirement and independent ECHL teams can have players from any NHL/AHL team assigned. Generally, players will be promoted to the AHL before moving on the NHL and non-entry-level NHL players must consent to being assigned to the ECHL. In addition, there are three low-level minor leagues: the Federal Prospects Hockey League (FPHL), the Ligue Nord-Am√©ricaine de Hockey (LNAH), and the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL). The FPHL has ten teams in the eastern and midwestern United States and considers itself a development league feeding into the SPHL, ECHL, and European leagues. The NLAH is based in the Canadian province of Quebec and consists of six teams. The league has had stipulations that only players from Quebec or who played junior hockey there are eligible and the league boasts many former NHL players. The SPHL is a development league comprising ten teams in the southeastern and midwestern United States.  International play  USA Hockey is recognized by the International Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic Committee as the governing body for amateur organized ice hockey in the United States and is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. Its mission is to promote the growth of hockey in America and provide the best possible experience for all participants and its programs support and develop players, coaches, officials, and facilities. The United States men's national ice hockey team is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado and is composed of American-born ice hockey players from college through the NHL level. The United States women's national ice hockey team hosts various training camps around the United States and is composed of American-born ice hockey players. USA Hockey also operates the USA Hockey National Team Development Program, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The program's goal is to prepare student-athletes under the age of 18 for participation on U.S. national teams and continued success throughout their future hockey careers. The NTDP consists of two teams; the U.S. National Under-18 Team, and the U.S. National Under-17 Team. These teams compete in the United States Hockey League in addition to playing NCAA colleges and in international competition.  College hockey  College ice hockey is ice hockey played between colleges with their teams composed of enrolled students. In the United States, college hockey is played between colleges and universities with the competitive governance structure established by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). The National Collegiate Athletic Association has conducted national championships for men's ice hockey since 1948, and women's ice hockey since 2001. U.S. college hockey players must be deemed eligible for NCAA competition by the NCAA Eligibility Center, a process that examines a student-athlete's academic qualifications and amateur status. Players who have participated in major junior ice hockey or any professional hockey league are considered ineligible to play in the NCAA. The NCAA currently has three divisions for ice hockey, Division I, Division II and Division III. Of the three divisions only Division I and Division III have a championship sponsored by the NCAA. The NCAA's top level, Division I, has 59 teams in six conferences: Atlantic Hockey, Big Ten, ECAC Hockey, Hockey East, National Collegiate Hockey Conference, and Western Collegiate Hockey Association. The NCAA Division I Championship is a 16-team, single-elimination tournament, divided into four, 4-team regional tournaments. The winner of each regional advances to the Frozen Four to compete for the national championship. In Division III hockey there are 74 programs in 9 conferences. The current Division III national championship format is an 11-team, single-elimination bracket. The separate American Collegiate Hockey Association was formed in 1991 and is a chartered non-profit corporation that governs non-varsity or club-varsity college ice hockey in the United States. The organization provides structure and regulations, promotes the quality of play, and sponsors National Awards and National Tournaments. The ACHA's policies cover team and player eligibility, rules of play, ranking procedures, national tournament procedures, and other administrative issues, although the ACHA parallels the NCAA Division III with most eligibility requirements, gameplay rules, etc. The ACHA currently has three men's and two women's divisions and includes approximately 450 teams from across the United States. Teams offer no athletic scholarships and typically receive far less university funding. The ACHA offers an opportunity for college hockey programs that struggle with large budgets and Title IX issues, as an alternative to the NCAA structure. Many schools field separate teams in both the NCAA and ACHA. Men's U.S. college hockey is a feeder system to the National Hockey League and collegiate athletes who meet eligibility requirements can enter the NHL Draft. As of the 2010‚Äì11 season, 30 percent of NHL players (a total of 294) had U.S. college hockey experience prior to turning professional.  Junior and major junior hockey  Junior hockey is played by athletes between 16 and 20 years old. The leagues are normally organized on a franchise system and can play many more games than are normally played at the high school or college level. Major junior hockey is organized into three leagues run by the Canadian Hockey League: the Ontario Hockey League, Western Hockey League, and Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Most of these teams are in Canada, but there have also been teams in the American states of Maine, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington. Major junior players lose NCAA eligibility because they have agents, sign contracts and are given stipends. Two USA Hockey-sanctioned leagues based in the United States, the Tier I United States Hockey League (USHL) and the Tier II North American Hockey League (NAHL), are run in a similar fashion to the Canadian junior A teams in order for the players to keep NCAA eligibility. Four Hockey Canada junior A leagues have teams in the United States: the British Columbia Hockey League in Washington, the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League in Michigan, the Ontario Junior Hockey League in New York, and the Superior International Junior Hockey League in Minnesota. Tier III and independent junior leagues typically also consider themselves junior A, but usually utilize a pay-to-play based system that amateur players must pay in order to participate. The majority of current NHL players came through major junior hockey. For a while, some NHL teams had agreements with amateur teams to help them develop players that would later play professionally, however, this practice was stopped when the NHL expanded in 1967.  High school hockey  High schools in some states compete in sanctioned ice hockey leagues sponsored by State High School Association while other states compete in leagues not sponsored by their State High School Association. Typically, sponsored leagues exist in regions where ice hockey is traditionally popular, such as the Great Lakes Region (e.g., Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio) and the New England Region (e.g., Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island) while non- sponsored leagues typically exist in less traditional ice hockey regions, such as the Southeast Region and Rocky Mountain Region. However, some exceptions do exist, such as Colorado having a sponsored league and Illinois having a non- sponsored league.  Minor hockey  Minor hockey in the United States is played below the junior age level (16 years old). Players are classified by age, with each age group playing in its own league. The rules, especially as it relates to body contact, vary from class to class. Unlike most American sports, athletes participate in minor ice hockey as part of clubs as opposed to schools.

Watts published many professional studies and died in 2007.  Early life and education  Frederick Payne Watts, noted psychologist was born in 1904 in Staunton to Charles H. and Harriett Watts. Watts was one of five mulatto children, three of whom went on to be a physician, a dentist and of course a psychologist. Despite limited income, high educational aspirations were encouraged from an early age. As a child, Watts was influenced by his father who was an avid reader and supported the family through farming or maintenance work, and his mother, who stayed home to raise their five children. Watts was educated in the Washington, D.C. public school system. Upon graduating from Dunbar High School in 1922, Watts attended Howard University. Initially, he planned on pursuing a career in ophthalmology. Soon after enrolling, Watts changed his focus to psychology, as he was interested in ‚Äúwhy people misbehave.‚Äù During this time, he studied under Albert Beckham who furthered his interest in the field. Watts graduated in 1926 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and French, and with a teaching fellowship, which allowed him to complete his master's degree. After teaching for a year at Kittrell College in North Carolina, he returned to Washington, D.C. to accept a faculty position at Howard. Before he returned, Beckham left, leaving Watts and Francis Sumner to form the two-person department until Max Meenes joined them in 1930.Guthrie, 1976, p. 198  Professional life  While at Howard with Sumner, Watts produced two important texts for the emerging literature on Black psychology. Together, they published ‚ÄúRivalry Between Uniocular Negative After Images and the Vision of the Other Eye‚Äù and he independently researched and wrote A Comparative and clinical Study of Delinquent and Non-Delinquent Negro Boys. Watts remained at Howard until 1942, one year after he earned a PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1941. According to the school's officials, he was the first African American to earn a PhD from the university and fourth in the nation to earn a PhD in psychology. A year later, Watts was drafted by the Army. His appointment did not limit his educational or professional interests but rather gave him room for growth. During the time he served, he was a pre-induction classification officer and personnel consultant, setting up psychological testing facilities and supervising counseling of enlisted personnel. Discharged as a captain in the adjutant general's office, Dr. Watts was appointed assistant chief clinical psychologist for the Veterans Administration regional office in Philadelphia‚Äù.Sullivan, 2007, p. 1  Legacy  Watts returned to Howard in 1948 where he worked until he retired in 1970. Upon his return, he started the Liberal Arts Counseling Service which was renamed University Counseling Service, when they expanded it to serve the entire student body. The University Counseling Service not only gave Watts the opportunity to practice his long term passion full-time, but also gave him a permanent location and transient population which allowed him conduct a number of significant institutional studies. Some of the studies he conducted out of the University Counseling Center include Initial Group Counseling of Freshmen, A Study of the College Environment, The Development of a Behavior Judgment Scale, and Developmental Counseling. In addition to teaching psychology and directing the University Counseling Service, he was a Diplomat in Clinical Psychology (ABEPP) and was affiliated with many of the top professional organizations. Following his retirement from Howard in 1970, Watts maintained an active interest in counseling and clinical psychology. His wife, Louise Armstead Watts, died in 1974. Dr. Watts lived to be 103 years old. He died of congestive heart failure on April 7, 2007 at the Howard University Hospital. He left four daughters, nine grandchildren and fifteen great- grandchildren.Guthrie, 1976, p. 199  Works in depth  In 1941, Watts published A Comparative Study of Delinquent and Non-Delinquent Negro Boys. Using the Otis Self-Administering Test of Mental Ability, the Detroit Manual Ability Task, the Healy Pictorial Completion II, the Minnesota Paper Form Board Test, the Woodworth-Matthews Personal Data Sheet, the Personal Index, The Vineland Social Maturity Scale, An Adaptation of the C.E.I. Pupil Data Sheet, and case histories of the delinquents he investigated psychological aspects of delinquent and non-delinquent Negro boys. Watts worked with 92 boys in the Industrial Home School for Colored Children in the District of Columbia and 91 boys from the school they went to before being sent to the Industrial Home. Holding age (all participants were between 14 and 16) and IQ (average of 77) constant, the boys were tested to determine ‚Äúwhether there are: (1) differences in competency to respond to concrete situations as measured by standardized tests; (2) differences in emotional stability and tendencies toward problem behavior as measured by personality tests; (3) differences in social maturity as measured by a social maturity scale; (4) relationships among the various tests administered, and (5) differences as determined through a questionnaire‚Äù (Watts, 1941, 192). Watts concluded that when general intelligence and age remain constant, there is no significant difference between delinquent and non-delinquent boys in their competency to respond to concrete situations. He also did not find any notable differences within their tendencies towards problem behavior, emotional stability, and social maturity. He accused oppositional findings of other studies to inadequate control. Watts argues that it is impossible to differentiate between delinquent and non- delinquent Negro boys. He did however find that there were differences in interests, habits, and other general attitudes. Lastly, he noted that the delinquent boys had less parental or adult controls in their lives. Indicating that ‚Äúfurther investigation in regard to parental or home control of the groups might lead to establishing useful and significant differences between delinquent and non-delinquent Negro boys.Watts, 1941, p. 205 Along with James Stanfiel, Watts published a study on Freshman Expectations and Perceptions of the Howard University Environment. In this two-part study, Watts and Stanfiel observe incoming freshmen‚Äôs initial perception of the school and how they change over time. The authors argue that the college educator should become more familiar with the students' perception of the school as it relates to their personal development. ‚ÄúIf the custodians of the educational process are not informed of, and sensitive to, the student‚Äôs experience, feelings, and needs, the student may suffer for it. Ultimately, the institution also suffers‚Äù.Stanfiel & Watts, 1970, 132 To further advocate this point, they did a study of the Howard University freshmen during the 1965-66 school year. They used (CUES) to assess the relationship between the experience of the student and the policies of the university. CUES is a set of 150 ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse‚Äù items describing the college experience. There are five subcategories consisting of thirty questions each. The first category measures ‚Äúthe degree to which personal status and practical benefit are emphasized in the college environment; second, \\"community\\" assesses ‚Äúthe degree to which the campus is friendly, cohesive, and group oriented; third, \\"awareness\\" measures ‚Äúthe degree to which there is a concern with self-understanding, reflectiveness, and the search for personal meaning; fourth, \\"propriety\\" assesses ‚Äúthe degree to which politeness, protocol, and consideration are emphasized; and lastly, \\"scholarship\\" looks at ‚Äúthe degree to which serious interest in scholarship and competition for academic achievement are evidenced‚Äù.Stanfiel & Watts, 1970, p. 133 CUES was administered to approximately 1000 Howard freshmen in September and a follow-up was administered in January. The results were compared to CUES from 48 colleges and universities throughout the country, none of which were predominantly black institutions. They found that Howard students expected to be in an environment that focuses on stellar academic performance and fosters and supports social and individual personal well- being. While many of the responses model the national trend of ‚Äúfreshman myth‚Äù Howard students had some distinct trends. They were more oriented towards practicality but no so much on awareness and propriety. Further discussions led to questions about the influence on culture and socio-economic factors. In the second administration, they found differences ranging from 11 to 55 percentile points. There were no significant differences in practicality and propriety. While they still perceive the school to have a strong community, it was far from the ‚Äúinterpersonal paradise‚Äù they were expecting. Scholarship and awareness fell by 55 and 43 percentile points. The researchers concluded that a sense of disappointment was evident and while it was temporary and mild in some cases, it could also be more enduring and detrimental in others. They argued that the college needed to take initiative in ending these vast misconceptions. They attributed some of the misconceptions to the colleges ‚Äúover-selling‚Äù tactics and also to the popular attitude that college is the ‚Äúcure-all‚Äù in society.Stanfiel & Watts, 1970, 134 References  Works cited  * Guthrie, R.

Since the wing is braced to the mainwheels and the mainwheels are connected by a rigid axle, the pneumatic tires provide the only suspension. The aircraft was originally intended to meet the requirements of the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, including that category's maximum empty weight. The original ultralight models of the Mini-MAX were equipped with the Rotax 277 engine to achieve acceptable empty weights. Today the 1030F MAX 103 and 1100F Mini-MAX achieve an acceptable FAR 103 empty weight if they are equipped with the Hirth F-33 powerplant. Other models use heavier engines which place them in the US Experimental - Amateur-built category. The Mini-MAX was also developed into a high winged version, called the Hi-MAX. The two designs share much in the way of parts and design concept commonality. Variants ;1030F MAX-103 :Single seat, open cockpit, mid-wing aircraft with the Hirth F-33 engine. Still in production.

It reverted to military use after the opening of Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport on 21 January 1990. History During War of Resistance/World War II, the airport was known as Peishiyi (Paishihyi) Airfield (Wades-Gile)/Baishiyi (Standard Pinyin), and was the Chinese Air Force base for the 4th Pursuit Group composed primarily of Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighter squadrons assigned for the defense of then-wartime capital of Chongqing; an I-15 fighter of 21st PS, 4th PG shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-21 heavy-bomber over Bashiyi air base on 06 June, 1940.https://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=281 The airport was then used by the United States Army Air Forces Fourteenth Air Force as the U.S. entered the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor.https://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=281 Baishiyi was a command and control base, being used late in the war as the headquarters of the 68th Composite Wing, which controlled the combat operations of the 23d Fighter Group and the 308th Bombardment Group. In addition C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft used the airport flying troops and supplies into the area as well as combat wounded to rear areas. The Americans remained at the airport after the war ended, the facility becoming the headquarters of the China Air Service Command, which supplied equipment and other logistical support to American and Chinese forces, along with being headquarters of Fourteenth Air Force. The American units began closing down in early 1946, with the last personnel of the 10th Weather Squadron departing the facility on 31 July 1946.

With growing success, the House established in 1935 a two-story shop at 376 rue Saint Honor√©, which remained open until 2007. With a no-nonsense, hands-on approach, Countess de Regoli, an avid skier, swimmer and golfer, tried out her creations on herself before she offered them for sale, and often modelled them for clients.VOGUE US, March 1933 The designs appeared smart enough to be worn in town, reuniting sports and town wardrobes.The Montreal Gazette, Sept 10th 1932 File:VERA BOREA-Ski silhouette- FEMINA 1933 Oct.pngSki suit, 1933 File:VERA BOREA Jumpsuit circa 1934.pngJumpsuit, 1934 File:VERA BOREA - CULOTTES DRESS for TENNIS - 1934.pngTennis Dress, 1934 File:VERA BOREA - Swuimming suit - 1934.pngSwimming suit, 1934  International success  Vera Borea soon became the favorite destination on both sides of the Atlantic for women going for the new relaxed lifestyle.VOGUE US, Oct 1932Pittsburgh Post Gazette, 9 June 1932 American department stores snapped her designsKaufmann's Ad, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 9 June 1932, pg. 13.VOGUE US, March 1933 and the House became the reference for garments that were simple in line but unusual in materials and cut, modern and practical. Vera Borea's creations often featured details that, beyond looking good, served a practical purpose and could be wore on multiple occasions such as after tennis, for motoring or on a shipboard.

The House started off designing daywear, and soon became known for garments that were elegant yet dynamic, stylish yet practical. Her creations often had unusual details that served a practical purpose. Even her evening wear, which she introduced a few seasons later, avoided superfluous details and instead focused on a superb cut, a comfortable fit, and excellent workmanship.VOGUE FR, April 1938VOGUE FR, May 1939VOGUE FR, Dec. 1948 In general, the designer favored simple but noble materials like wool, linen, hemp, and cotton, often with a textured or nubby surface.THE NEW YORK TIMES, Published: 21 February 1932 Even when she used silk, it was usually in heavy woven patterns, which Vera Borea had made in Italy.La Soierie de Lyon : Syndicat des fabricants de soieries de Lyon. Page 6. She borrowed liberally from menswear, and regularly used wool flannel, tweeds and pinstripes for her women's suits and separates.VOGUE US, Mar 1933VOGUE FR, Dec. 1938 Even ski ensembles were made of wool flannel and were often shown with an ascot or a tie. Another example of mixing men's and women's codes could be seen in an extraordinary black velvet ski suit that Borea designed in 1933, which looked like a tuxedo and closed with metallic clips that echoed those of a ski boot. The designer re-visited the theme often, like an evening wear she designed in 1945 that sported a tuxedo top and a full skirt like a ballerina's tutu... decades before \\"le Smoking\\" burst onto the fashion scene.FEMINA 1945, Tuxedo Evening Wear by Vera Borea, illustrated by GRUAU File:VERA BOREA-TUXEDO JUMPSUIT-1945.png Tuxedo Jumpsuit, 1945 File:VERA BOREA-DAY DRESS-1945.jpgDay Dress, 1945  Technical innovation  A constant desire to explore and innovate permeated Vera Borea's work. She figured out how to weather-proof corduroy and used it for a raincoat. Another raincoat was made of rubber. She spun hemp with silk for travel suitsTHE NEW YORK TIME, Published: 5 June 1932 and introduced in France the two-way-stretch elastic fabrics.THE NEW YORK TIME, Published : 21 May 1933 An evening coat was made of transparent fabric. An aviator jacket was made of supple leather and a knitted back panel, making it wearable both indoors and outdoors. Shoes sported heels made of rubber. Buttons were made of Brazil nuts. Other elements like fur, raffia, rope, bone, nut, feathers, pine cones and leather also showed up in her designs.THE NEW YORK TIMES, Published : 5 February 1933, pg.

For example, the designer introduced high-waisted pants that skimmed the body from just below the bust down to the waist, with no belt necessary. She lowered the waistline down to the hips for a slimming line. She showed the pants with a bolero, bomber jackets, cropped sweaters or full blouses, which enhanced the elongated effect. Wrap blouses and dresses did away with a need for zippers, buttons and belts. Halter tops did away with collars. Flared and gored skirts provided fullness and ease of movement while avoiding the stiffness and puffiness of a gathered waistline. Judicious draping on dresses and jackets, inverted pleats on pants, set-in panels; all continued this body-conscious philosophy. Waistbands and cuffs became ribbed and elasticized, offering more comfort and a sleeker line, as well as protection against the elements.Harper‚Äôs Bazaar Magazine, October 1932 Scarves were built into blouses or jackets, or looped through a belt. Short sleeved jackets provided both polish and practicality. Pockets freed up a woman's hands, as did chains and clips, which held a clip-on cigarette case, a visor, or a pair of gloves. Collars disappeared from coats and jackets, or were shrunk down to a simple stand-up style. Kimono cut coats closed with sashes or one or two oversized buttons. A slim ribbed turtleneck pullover became one with the body and removed the need for a scarf to keep the wearer's throat warm. Thin ribbed pullovers were layered, making them ideal for cool temperatures or outdoor sports, but also easy to peel off once inside for maximum comfort.VOGUE US, Oct 1932 Vera Borea also made a mark with her swimsuits, which were often made from plain wool or cotton knits, and little ornament. The flair was in the details: low backs, criss-crossing straps, flared hips, discreet patterns. In 1934, the designer showed swimsuits worn under a matching skirt or flared shorts, giving women a new alternative to the fuller covering of an apron dress. With either option, a woman could simply slip on the skirt, shorts or dress over her swimsuit and go straight to lunch or jump into her car. An apron style sundress with a low back allowed women to soak up the sun's rays on the terrace of a restaurant. Pants got a cargo pocket and jackets incorporated pockets or deeply cuffed sleeves that could hold a swim cap or a wet bathing suit. The beach wear range grew to include sleeveless dresses with matching cotton coats and capri pants, oversized terry cloth lined jackets, high-waisted shorts and bra tops; with matching sandals, socks and beach bags.VOGUE US, March 1933 1932 Passionate about skiing, swimming and golf, Borea particularly enjoyed designing sportswear because she found it so difficult to buy clothing that was chic yet comfortable and well- priced. Her 1932 sports clothes designs included a skirt and waist-length jacket made of thick woolly tricot. These were worn in combination with an open work inside sweater of the same color. A tweed top coat with a black belt and a loose wrap around front gave a harmonious silhouette.Paris Modes, New York Times, 3 January 1932, pg. X11. Paris fashion releases in the late spring were replete with frocks made of heavy black wool. Borea's black wool crepon frock had an incrusted collar and top sleeves of white shaved lamb.Nonchalance Is Now Chic, New York Times, 22 May 1932, pg. X9. Her summer 1932 fashions emphasized a high-waist effect, even when no belt was worn. The wearer's figure was closely fit from just below her bust to the waist. Borea's day skirts had hemlines from eight to ten inches from the ground. The designer favored materials which were quite rough and open-surfaced, primarily cotton or woolen ones. These were tailored into small modern suits which were worn with blouses made of dimity or crocheted Irish linen thread. These featured turn down collars and muslin ties. For town wear Borea stressed rough linen fabrics and she often employed negligee materials in formal fashions. She rarely used silks, but sometimes created heavy basket or chevron (insignia) patterns, which she obtained hand woven from Italy. The youthful designs were without pretense and definitely were not flapperish.Paris Features Cotton, New York Times, 21 February 1932, pg. X13. Beach Accessories in interwoven Rafia and Leather, 1935 1933 Summer designs revealed in February 1933 marked a milestone in Borea's designing career. From this point she no longer showed pants, with the exception of plus fours, which she styled for boating. Her very feminine sports frocks and evening gowns were quite similar, except for their lengths. The frocks were shorter, sixteen inches off the floor, while the evening gowns were ankle-length. Both possessed accentuated sunburn decolletes, suspended from very small ribbon-threaded metal chains. Borea lowered the waistlines of her creations to the hipbone. Her fashions began to exaggerate fullness in overblouses and the wide, flared, gored skirts she designed. Borea's bathing suits were short and flaring, made from plain wool or checked cotton. She created taffeta blouses with linen suits.Vera Borea Makes Plus-Fours for Boating-Metal Trimmings Are a Novelty, New York Times, 5 February 1933, pg. X9. For spring and summer Borea used knitted shoulder yokes. A white suede golf jacket she designed had a knitted white cotton yoke. Her mixed wool motor and travel coats featured knitted wool yokes in very dark tones. Borea's cotton or linen dresses and jackets had yokes with bright contrasts and belts of knitted wool.Two-In-One, New York Times, 19 February 1933, pg. X9. 1934 A novelty introduced in January 1934 was the skirted bathing suit. A skirt was worn over maillot or flaring one-piece shorts. The separate skirt began to outmode the fuller covering previously given by a beach apron. Borea's runner consisted of two flared panels which opened up on both sides. She used a large printed cotton handkerchief, which was popular in St. Tropez. Her creativity showed in the stylishness which she exhibited, working the scarves into new forms to cover backless frocks. Often the skirt was one color, the maillot another, and the wraplet a third. Some favored combinations were dark blue, venetian pink, and pale yellow, or Chinese blue, old rose, and beige.Bathing Suits Undergoing Changes, New York Times, 14 January 1934, pg. X9. Ski suit in Schenectady Gazette, 1 January 1934 1935 In May 1935 a copy of a Borea sundress sold for $5.95 in a Los Angeles store. Made of cotton Indianhead, the dress left the entire back open to soak in the sun's warmth. It featured a block print with a natural background and a design of green or purple lines. The block print was also adorned with turquoise, gold, and coral (color). The sundress was fashionable to wear over a bathing suit for a luncheon indoors at a beach club.King Cotton Dresses His Attractive Subjects in Newest Smartly-Tailored Summer Styles, Los Angeles Times, 6 May 1935, pg. A6. Borea's collection for fall 1935 included suits, jackets, and long redingotes, which were semi-fitted with leg-o'-mutton sleeves. Her fashions had a widening shoulder line. Her sports suits were uniquely cut in soft colored tweeds and were worn with dark crape shirts. The short sleeves on these shirts were also widened. Borea's day clothes featured a number of shades of gray-green. These were accentuated with buttons and scarves of yellow or guardsman's red. Bishop violet was a prominent color of Borea's evening wear designs. A nubby woolen, woven with bear's hair, was featured in the designer's sports wear. Her wool daytime frocks had velvet belts and trimmings. Highlights included pine-cone rosettes, which replaced sports buttons. Pheasant feathers were exhibited as trimming.Paris Sports Suits Show Novel Trend, New York Times, 7 August 1935, pg. 21. 1936 In July Borea released a white flannel suit especially for the sea-cum-casino. Worn with a chali blouse, it had subtle differences with suits introduced by Lucien Lelong and other designers.Dressing The Part, Manchester Guardian, 20 July 1936, pg. 6. 1938 Borea' silhouette was characterized by moulded bodices, normal shoulders, small waists, and short skirts, with some of them pleated and others slightly flared. She often made use of linens for beach, town, and evening wear. She frequently employed an apronline, which was either draped or tied in the back. Other prominent features of note were striped and embroidered materials (often oriental types), and colored piping (sewing). Her colorful printed frocks were worn beneath slim, dark coats.By Wireless From Paris, New York Times, 30 January 1938, pg. 80. 1939 For fall 1939 Borea styled striped necktie wool dresses. Her daytime frocks were worn with necktie wool blouses and heavy leather belts. Wool jackets were shown with plain skirts. Full skirted dresses with shirtwaist bodices were a part of her evening wear. One design was made in red and green vertical stripes. It tucked in at the waist. Her evening gowns were inspired from portraits by Velasquez. The features included long sleeves and gold buttons, with modern shirtwaist effects.Double Bell Evening Silhouette Is Novel Idea of Paris Designer, New York Times, 4 August 1939, pg. 15. Tennis suit, 1948 1940 Flared basques were created by Borea for wear in the evenings. Her styles displayed screw- head buttons with a contrasting color on a square cut jacket. The look was very individual.Summer Clothes in Paris, Manchester Guardian, 27 May 1940, pg. 3. 1946 Borea's 1946 fall collection was presented on 12 September at her Paris salon, which had been redecorated with white and red and massed with red flowers. The lines of her clothing designs were simple, with natural shoulders. Fullness was eschewed except for drapery featured on a slim silhouette for evening. Among her fashions at the showing included a gray flannel ski suit with white leather suspenders and gold buckles. Borea introduced amber, mouse gray, and moss green corduroy box jackets over tweed suits or simple turtleneck wool dresses. Her town dresses and suits employed black wool bands or were inset with black velvet. Perhaps her most attractive ensemble in the collection was a mouse gray jacket with a plum frock.Paris Sees Garb For Sportswomen, New York Times, 13 September 1946, pg. 5. 1959 Borea designed a raincoat made from golden brown proofed corduroy. Its buttons were of embossed silver.Rainwear a la Francaise, The Guardian, 16 October 1959, pg. 7.

The second work was not get me wrong, a song that mixes English and Portuguese, and also enjoyed success on Brazilian radio. Produced by the renowned DJ Deeplick, the repertoire left aside the romantic focus of the previous work of the singer, being more directed to the musical trends worldwide, such as electro-pop and rhythm and blues, inspired by Felipe Harmata's folk songs. The album spawned two singles: \\"Fly\\" was the lead-single and reached #1 on radios stations and features the american rapper Ja Rule. Wanessa sings the song in English. \\"N√£o Me Leve a Mal (Let me Live)\\" was released as the second single on November 2009. Composition The album is a differential in relation to the composers. Deeplick wrote most of the songs, along with Marcelo Mira, which made Jason Deere, C√©sar Lemos and Karla Aponte (their longtime partners) completely out of the album. Lu Cardoso (wife of presenter Fausto Silva) wrote 2 songs, while Wanessa herself wrote only 3 songs. In \\"Fly\\" Wanessa tells about his musical trajectory. \\"Gosto Tanto\\", \\"Sentindo a Minha Vida\\", \\"Como eu Te Quis\\", \\"Vou Propor\\" and \\"Te Beija\\" theme romantic relationships in their most different formats. In \\"Desejos\\", \\"Perdeu\\" and \\"Dono da Noite\\" the theme is the woman and her own desires. \\"Do not Take Me Alone\\" talks about resentment of betrayal and revenge. \\"M√°quina Digital\\" makes an analogy to consumerism. \\"O Que Vem do Reggae √© Bom\\" and \\"Me Leva\\" tells about enjoying the night and dancing. \\"Things of Life\\" has as its theme the experience of life that each carries. Disclosure Several presentations to launch and drive the disclosure were made, the official launch of the CD took place at Doming√£o do Faust√£o. A surprise presentation was made at the nightclub The Week to publicize his new music style in which she made a memorable cover performance of the hit Just Dance Lady Gaga leading the audience to madness after that there were several invitations to other presentations that originated the Tour Balada who toured Brazil. Wanessa made his first appearance with its own single in the BMV and competed in the categories \\"Best Pop Video\\" and \\"Hit of the Year\\" with Fly. He also participated in the event Fashion Rocks singing Fly Me Take and not evil, in the same event also presented the singers Mariah Carey, Grace Jones and Ciara. Due to the success of Fly on the radio, Wanessa was invited to open shows of Florian√≥polis and Rio de Janeiro during the singer Beyonc√© I Am... World Tour Brazil, his set had 6 tracks highlighting Fly and served to introduce the new style Wanessa to an essentially more pop audience. Critical reception The album received mixed reviews. Columnist Gilberto Ten√≥rio of O Grito! \\"The first single from Meu Momento already makes clear the option for this new phase.\\" Fly \\"could very well be on a CD by some American R&B; singer.\\" But the final evaluation is negative for the album, saying that Wanessa tries to look more modern, but ends up with no self-identity and \\"a handful of disposable songs\\" on the album, citing \\"Desejos\\" as robotics, Gosto Tanto\\" Generic, and \\" Do not get me wrong \\"classified as\\" of dubious tastes like \\"my head is not a step.\\" He praises Wanessa's intention for new sonorities, and even finds a style of his own, but that resulted in a \\"handful of disposable songs\\". Critic Mauro Ferreira from Musical Notes column commented that the production of Deeplick and Denilson Miller tries to insert Wanessa into the pop scene, but for him the album \\"sounds artificial like the beats that surround Wanessa's voice, giving the impression of That the twist was planned in its smallest detail in the marketing room of Sony Music\\". Edwin Leroy of LuxoLana's website said the compositions are weak and that Wanessa \\"still sins in song lyrics - some seem to be more childish than the image Wanessa seems to keep today,\\" but praises the entries, saying that this Was the positive step of the album.

Richard attended Westminster School singing in the choir at the coronation of King George VI. He then studied medicine at Trinity College in Cambridge University and at the Westminster Hospital in London. Army WWII medical career Entering the British army in 1944 as a medical officer, his three- week training included learning to ride a motor bicycle. He served in Italy and Yugoslavia. He wrote that \\"I was not courageous enough to be a conscientious objector, although my feelings were in that direction.\\" Later he became a British forces medical officer in Venice: he bought a traditional sandolo boat to row himself to visit the sick, keeping the boat on the Grand Canal in front of Venice's Europa Hotelhttp://www.westineuropareginavenice.com/ where he was billeted. His work included medical support for the many Italian pregnant brides of British soldiers. Hereford Hospital In the late 1940s he worked at Hereford hospital. He fell off his motor bike, concussed himself (crash helmets were little used then), and lost his sense of taste and smell. As an orthopaedic surgeon, he operated on many motor-bike riders after accidents and so campaigned vigorously for the use of crash helmets. He wrote to the then young Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, recounting his accident and hospital experience, suggesting Prince Philip promote the use of crash helmets ‚Äì Prince Philip soon advocated them at a suitable function, and helmets were in wide use in Britain in two years. Nigeria In 1955, he established the trauma and orthopaedic service while working at the new University College Hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria. He there pioneered the use of Kuschner nails to fix femoral shaft fractures, and established Nigeria‚Äôs first blood bank. His older two children were born in Nigeria. Swiss AO technique Richard returned to Britain in 1961 to be a Consultant Orthopaedic and Trauma surgeon at the West Bromwich Hospital. In 1965 he took sabbatical leave to work in Chur, Switzerland with Professor Martin Allg√∂wer who in the early 1960s had pioneered a new internal fixation technique for fractures. Richard introduced to Britain this AO technique developed by the AO Foundation (the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr Osteosynthesefragen).AO Foundation website Convinced that this technique was a major advance in fracture management, he spread the technique throughout the UK via his orthopaedic registrars. Birmingham General Hospital From 1967 to 1983, he was a consultant orthopaedic and trauma surgeon and lecturer at Birmingham General Hospital. Earlier than most surgeons, he assisted his trainees in many operations ‚Äì they emerged particularly competent in AO fixation and Wagner leg lengthening techniques. In the early 1970s he sent his trainees to learn the new Charnley total hip replacement technique. Many of his trainees attended his retirement party when he was presented with a mounted Charnley hip replacement. First editor of Injury journal Richard and Mary Batten with their children at a wedding in 1966 In 1969, he became the first editor of the journal Injury which introduced academic rigour to the management of traumatic injuries. He was editor until 1983 for some 58 editions. The full journal title was originally Injury: The British Journal of Accident Surgery ‚Äî later, as it had stronger international influence, it was changed to Injury: International Journal of the care of the Injured. Married life, retirement, muscular dystrophy He married Mary Longford in Hampstead, London on 18 December 1954, eventually retiring to Crockham Hill, near Edenbridge, Kent. They had three children Susan, Lindsey and Belinda. For some 30 years Richard suffered from Myotonia Dystrophica. He died on 29 December 1997: his funeral was on 9 January 1998 in Tunbridge Wells.

He was the founder of the l'Ordre de Chevaliers Ma√ßons √âlus Co√´ns de l'Univers - Commonly referred to as the 'Elus Cohens' in 1761. He was the tutor, initiator and friend of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin and Jean-Baptiste Willermoz, and therefore regarded as the originator of Martinism. Biography Martinez de Pasqually, whose biography is continually being researched, due to the lack of documentation, appears in the history of French freemasonry in 1754. His exact date and place of birth, as well as his true nationality is unknown. Some say he was of Jewish descent, without being able to establish this with certainty. Certain similarities between Pasqually's theurgy and Portuguese hermetic thought led philosopher Sampaio Bruno (1857-1915) to argue that he was probably of Portuguese origin.Sampaio Bruno, Jos√© Pereira de (1904), O Encoberto. Porto: Livraria Moreira In 1772 Pasqually went to collect an inheritance in the island of Hispaniola. Grainville, one of his fervent disciples, came from the Caribbean. In any case, at the time he went to Saint Domingue, the French colony which was soon to become Haiti, he was traveling back and forth to a French colony and Spanish colony, not a Portuguese holding. He died within two years and appears to have influenced early mystic groups in the Caribbean. Others again claim he was born in Grenoble. In reality, we know nothing with certainty of his origin. His activities before 1760 are also poorly understood. This is largely due to the fact that he used several different names and signatures on official documents during his lifetime. Elus Cohens The Cohen Seal of Pasqually For twenty years, spanning from 1754 to 1774, the year of his death, Pasqually worked ceaselessly to establish and promote his . In 1754 he founded the Chapter of Scottish Judges in Montpellier. In 1761, he became affiliated with the lodge La Fran√ßaise in Bordeaux and founded a Cohen Temple there. In 1764 La Fran√ßaise was reorganized by him as Fran√ßaise √âlue √âcossaise to indicate that it now had a Chapter of superior degrees. In 1766 the directors of the Masonic province of Bordeaux declared that they were abolishing all constitutions relating to higher grades apart from the first three (Regular Blue- or St. John's degrees of: Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master). As a result, all the works of the Chapter were suspended. This same year Martinez travelled to Paris and found a new and explicit Elus Cohen-temple together with Bacon de Chivalerie, Jean-Baptiste Willermoz, Fauger d'Ign√©acourt, the Count of Lusignan, Henri de Loos, Grainville, and several others that were to play important parts in the history the Order. In 1767, he established the Sovereign Tribunal who would direct the whole Order of the Elus Coens. In 1768 he met with Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin. The personality and teachings of Pasqually made a deep and lasting impression on Saint-Martin. Conversely, Pasqually himself was influenced by Saint-Martin who decided to leave his military career in 1771 and become the personal secretary of Martinez, replacing Abbe Pierre Fourni√©. From this period the notable development of the rituals of the order starts and Pasquallys drafting of his magnum opus, the Treatise on the Reintegration of Beings, the main doctrinal foundation of the Martinist theosophy and theurgy. In 1772 Martiez, embarked on a trip to Santo Domingo to receive an inheritance, and subsequently died there in 1774. Thereafter, the Order disintegrates. In 1776, the Coens Temples of La Rochelle, Marseilles, and Libourne fall into the grasp of the Grand Lodge of France. In 1777, the rites are no longer in operation and institutional use, except from some circles in Paris, Versailles and Eu. Finally, in 1781, Sebastien Las Casas, third and last 'Grand Sovereign' of the Elus Cohens (successor of Caignet de Lester, who died in 1778) ordered the closure of the eight remaining temples that still recognize his authority. Neither Las Casas nor Caignet played a very important role in the orders development. Despite the official closure, the Elus Coens continued to both practice theurgy, and to conduct initiations. On the other hand, the theosophical teaching of Martinez was not lost, in masonry, it spreads even long after the death of the leader through the Masonic system established by Willermoz shortly after death his master. Besides Willermoz and Saint-Martin, the last known personal disciple of Martinez was Abbe Pierre Fourni√©. It was around 1768 that he met the teacher who would make him turn around his life completely, and of whom would be employed as secretary. Initiated as an Elus Co√´n, the tonsured cleric Fourni√© resides mainly in Bordeaux, where he mediates the correspondences between different members of the Order. In 1776, Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin is quoted as describing him as an Elus Cohen exceptionally favored in supernatural manifestations; the source is Fourni√© himself in his own work What we've been, what we are and what we become (1802), in fear of saying too much. At the time of the revolution Fourni√© emigrated to England, where he remained until his death, and in this period, from 1818 to 1821, he befriends the Theosophist of Munich Franz von Baader. The structure of the Elus Cohens This doctrine, he intended for an elite chosen from the ranks of his contemporary masons, and gathered under the banner of the 'Elus Coens' (Elect Priests). Quickly this order gained quite the reputation in French masonic circles, but the theurgic operations remained reserved for the higher degrees. Martinez did not, to a greater extent, graft his system solely on freemasonry. Until 1761, it is to be located in Montpellier, Paris, Lyons, Bordeaux, Marseilles, and Avignon. In 1761 he built a special temple in Avignon, where he resided himself until 1766. At that time, the Order of the Elect Coens is worked as a high-degree system superimposed on the Blue Lodges: The first class has three symbolic degrees, and that of 'ma√Ætre parfait √©lu', then the grades Coens proper: apprentice Co√´n, fellowcraft Co√´n, and master Co√´n, Grand Master Co√´n or Grand Architect, Chevalier d'Orient or Knight Zorobabel, Commandeur d'Orient or Commander Zorobabel, and finally the last degree, the supreme consecration of Reaux Croix. In 1768, Jean-Baptiste Willermoz is ordained Reau-Croix by Bacon Chivalerie. Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin commenced the system in 1765, rising quickly to Commander of the Orient. The years 1769 and 1770 saw the Coen-groups multiply extensively in France. In 1772, Saint-Martin was ordained Reau-Croix. Recent discoveries on Pasqually's ancestry According to the researches of George C. and the elements discovered by Michele Friot and Nahon, namely a certificate of Catholicism (published in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Martines de Pasqually, Bordeaux) and the letters from Martinez regarding the Guers affair, neither Martinez nor his father could be Jewish. The third reason is that at the time, Jews were not accepted as Freemasons in France. These facts disprove the hypothesis proposed by the late Martinist-scholar Robert Amadou who proposed that Martinez was a Spanish Jew (Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin et le Martinisme, Paris, √âditions Le Griffon d'or, 1946). The theory of Martinez being Portuguese is also contested: The fact that Martinez traveled to Santo Domingo to receive an inheritance, does not support the theory of Portugal as his ethnic background. The island of St. Domingo (Hispaniola) was never under Portuguese rule, seeing that the French settlers, the 'Fr√®res de la C√¥te Fran√ßais' seized control over areas gradually abandoned by the Spaniards. In a word, the western part was under French sovereignty and that of the Spaniards was located to the east. (Henri Bernard Catus May 27, 2009). The place of residence for Martinez, namely Leogane and Port-au-Prince, was French and occupied by the regiment of Foix, the same military operation from which Saint-Martin himself was recruited. The wife of Martinez is believed to come from the very rich French settlers of the island; Collas de Mauvigni√© originally from Gornac near Bordeaux. Martines married Collas Angelique Marguerite, daughter of Anselm Collas on August 27, 1767 at Gornac. However, if Martinez spoke French very well, he wrote very badly. His son, according to a police report, spoke Spanish very well. The hypothesis of a Spanish origin should therefore be retained. Research done in Grenoble by G.C. on all civil records on marriage certificates shows that Martinez is not registered in Grenoble. But it is possible that children born in the military forces at the time were not recorded in parish registers. Grenoble keeps track of a document stating that Captain Pasqually was stationed there, but it may be a namesake at the recovery of bodies of troops from Spain and used in the French army. De Grainville was one of the most loyal of secretaries of Martinez, and also attained the degree of Reaux-Croix. He was born June 21, 1728, in the island of Bourbon (now Reunion Island), a native of Normandy (historical archives of the Army Ch√¢teau de Vincennes Paris). He ended his military career in 1780 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Doctrine The doctrine of Martinez is described as a key to any eschatological cosmology. God, the primordial Unity, had a desire to emanate beings from his own nature, but Lucifer, who wanted to exercise his own creative power, fell victim to his own faults. In his fall, which included his followers, he found himself trapped within an area designated by God to serve as their prison. God sent man, in an androgynous body and endowed with glorious powers, to keep Lucifer's rebels at bay and work towards their reconciliation. Adam prevaricated himself and fell into the very prison he was to contain, becoming a physical and mortal being, and was so thus forced to try to save both himself and the original creation. It can be done via inner perfection with the help of Christ, but also by the theurgic operations that Martinez taught to the men of desire he found worthy of receiving his initiation. Through these rites, the disciple is to enter into relations with angelic entities that appear in the operations as passes. These are to appear mostly in the form of characters or hieroglyphs of spirits invoked by the operator, as proofs that he is on the proper way of reintegration. Legacy After World War 2 Robert Ambelain created a new \\"Martinist Order of the √âlus Cohen\\" as a revival of the Order of Pasqually. This was officially closed, as publicly announced in the Martinist magazine L'Initiation, in 1964. However, several strains of martinist-orders have continued to operate the Elus Cohens in succession of the Ambelain resurgence. Today the Elus Cohens is mainly worked in two different manners, one in the fashion of Robert Ambelain, heavily influenced by his own Gnostic Church, the rite of Memphis-Misraim and his personal take on the kabbalah. There also exists another manner of operation, where Pasquallys original system is practiced more in tune with the intents of the system as it were in the 1770s, where neo-gnostic tendencies and kabbalah is removed, in favor of the original doctrines. In France one such circle is supposed to exist, but not in public. Officially, Ordre Reaux Croix is working the Elus Cohens in a similar manner, and also including women, as Pasqually himself did on two occasions.

Tracking is necessary to manage and reward or compensate the participants of an affiliate marketing group of participants or affiliate networks. The original concept comes from Affinity marketing. The participants that agree to promote or be promoted are called \\"affiliates\\". Those that promote and recommend are called \\"marketers\\" and the ones that have the products or services that are promoted are called \\"advertisers\\". The affiliate tracking software can be self-hosted or operate in a cloud. Regardless of that, trackers record page views and clicks of advertising material (banners, clicks, etc.), while also recording conversions, i.e. events that are deemed valuable by the marketers. Several online businesses create affiliate networks to manage affiliates that promote their products and services. Affiliate platforms are companies that intermediate and manage both marketers and advertisers, operating as a broker. The core of affiliate marketing software is tracking the various aspects of a given action, that are commonly categorised in eight types: # CPC (Cost per click) # CPA (Cost per acquisition) # CPM (Cost per impression) # CPS (Cost per sale) # CPI (Cost per install) # CPL (Cost Per Lead) # CPV (Cost Per Visitor) # CPO (Cost Per Order) Tracking refers to user-client IP detection, browser detection, marketer's affiliate referral and advertiser's completed transaction. The main feature of affiliate marketing software is consolidation of data that allows marketers and advertisers to perform various marketing optimization techniques. Although affinity marketing refers to marketing to persons sharing the same interests, the derived affiliate networks is closely related to sales channels and sales campaigns paying sales commissions, the reason why a solid and reliable software is required to prevent fraud and provide security and privacy for the parties involved in the transactions. Affiliate network software has other features like: * Generating Tracking Codes: Tracking of all clicks and leads require a special unique URL which contains the affiliate id and perhaps the campaign number, that is parsed to the advertiser's site and then associated with a user cookie to identify landing page, visit date, expire date, user identification and related sales closing information. These tracking URLs are also called as tracking codes. The software can generate a code, token or shortened URL, or can track by affiliate name. However, on January 14 Google announced that it would stop supporting 3-rd party cookies in 2 years. It caused the rise in popularity of (cookie-less and direct tracking methods) as reliable and safe alternatives for 3-rd party cookies-based methods. * Tracking Time and Location: Tracking time and location of impression, click, lead and sale, usually gathered from user cookies, sent back from the advertiser's server site to the tracking software server for consolidation. * Tracking Source: Not just the location source, as previously cited, source also refers to web page originating the URL link (blog article for instance) and source type (banner, keyword, search, chatbot or other), that gives both marketers and advertisers the information to improve context and maximize click-through ratios (how many times are required to show a banner to have someone click on it) and sales conversion (how many clicks are required to have someone buy the referred product/service). * Tracking Affiliate: Identify volume and effectiveness. Volume in traffic and effectiveness is how successful the affiliate is in selling (or making money for the network). * Fraud Detection: The need of fraud detection has increased with the expansion of affiliate marketing industry and the availability of IP changing software, chatbots that can simulate clicks and purchases, and even hacking to inject data into the software database to inflate affiliate credits and ratios. * Tracking GEO, ISP, Browser, Device, OS, IP etc. References Affiliate marketing ","title":"Affiliate tracking software"},{"id":"25136088","text":"In Greek mythology, Pleuron (Ancient Greek: Œ†ŒªŒµœÖœÅ·ø∂ŒΩŒøœÇ) was a son of Aetolus and Pronoe, daughter of Phorbus, and brother of Calydon.

Richard Doyle and Henry Edward Doyle were younger brothers. He was the uncle of Arthur Conan Doyle. He was educated as a Roman Catholic. He inherited a portion of his father's artistic ability, and in early life studied drawing and painting. Among other works he executed a painting of Dr. Johnson reading the manuscript of the 'Vicar of Wakefield,' which was engraved and attained considerable popularity. The copyright of the picture realised ¬£100. Feeling that Edward IV no longer values him, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, betrays the Yorkists by turning to the Lancastrian queen, Margaret of Anjou While comparatively young, however, Doyle abandoned the profession of an artist and devoted himself to historical studies. For his own edification he compiled a 'Chronicle of England' from B.C. 55 to A.D. 1485, which he adorned with numerous illustrations in colours. It received considerable praise from various persons to whom it was afterwards submitted, among others from the prince consort, and was well received by the public when published in 1864 (London, 12mo). Doyle's illustrations were engraved and printed in colours by Edmund Evans. Page from The Official Baronage of England Volume 2 The great undertaking of Doyle's life, however, was his Official Baronage of England, which included every rank of nobility except barons. The epithet 'official' in the title means not that Doyle's 'Baronage' was published 'by authority,' but that it gave an exhaustive list of the offices held by the peers of whom it treated. The compilation was at first designed especially to cover the period between the Norman Conquest and the Revolution of 1688, but it was afterwards brought down to 1885. It provided particulars in as complete a manner as possible, of the succession, titles, offices, heraldic bearings, and personal appearance of each peer. The work was published in three quarto volumes in 1886, a large-paper edition, limited to two hundred copies, appearing somewhat earlier in 1885. It was a painstaking but unequal work. For the earlier portion, especially the Norman and Angevin period, Doyle relied too much on secondary authorities, and was not sufficiently critical. Greatly to his disappointment, the book was not a financial success, and inflicted a heavy loss on the publishers. In 1886, he wrote the explanatory text for Richard Doyle's coloured cartoons, entitled Scenes from English History. He died in London on 3 December 1892 at his residence, 38 Dorset Square, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 9 December. Family On 12 February 1874, he married Jane Henrietta Hawkins at Our Lady of the Rosary Church, Marylebone Road, London. He made numerous drawings of famous moments in English history, as illustrations to \\"A Chronicle of England, B.C. 55 ‚Äì A.D. 1485\\" (see Wikimedia Commons link below) See also DOYLE, James E.

After working at a number of small newspapers, Porter moved to New York City in the 1830s. After employment at a newspaper in the city, he founded the Spirit of the Times, a newspaper modeled on a London paper called Bell's Life in London. The Spirit, which went through a number of names and incarnations over the years, was devoted to sports and other recreational pursuits. One of Porter's main interests involved horse racing, and he was involved in attempts to create the first stud book in the United States, which did not bear fruit. He was also instrumental in the development of American literature, as the Spirit published a number of short stories by American tall tale writers, and Porter edited two collections of short stories by American writers. After publishing the Spirit through the 1830s, he sold it to another printer but continued as the editor into the 1850s. He left the original Spirit in 1855 and in 1856 was hired as editor for another sporting newspaper, Porter's Spirit of the Times, published by George Wilkes. Porter died in 1858. Early life Porter was born on December 24, 1809, the son of Benjamin Porter and Martha Olcott in Newbury, Vermont. He was one of five boys born to his parents. His father was a lawyer, but died suddenly in 1818, leaving the family in difficult financial circumstances. He attended a charity school in Hanover, New Hampshire after the family moved there, but left school to work in a print shop. He also attended Dartmouth College.Harrison Background of the American Stud Book pp. 87‚Äì88 His mother died in 1825, which meant the family was broken up and Porter worked at a number of small newspapers before arriving in New York City in the early 1830s.Dizikes \\"Porter, William Trotter\\" American National Biography Online While in New York, Porter gained the nickname of \\"York's Tall Son\\". Editorial work Porter edited the Constellation, a newspaper in New York City that published humorous stories.Mott History of American Magazines p. 425 Porter became interested in sports, and concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, Porter published the first issue of a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The Spirit of the Times. Porter imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at Spirit of the Times failed quickly, and Porter sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the Traveller, and the Spirit was combined with the Traveller as the Traveller and Spirit of the Times. During the brief period that Porter operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When Porter sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New- Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 Porter purchased the Traveller and Spirit of the Times and renamed the newspaper back to Spirit of the Times, returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. Porter focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as cattle breeding, farm methods, books of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.Robertson History of Thoroughbred Racing in America p. 33 Porter was interested in reforming the sport of horse racing, and expended much effort in the newspaper trying to bring together horsemen in the various parts of the country. Although the effort did not bear fruit, the Spirit became a repository for information of interest to those involved in horse racing, printing statistics and results of races. Porter was also involved in attempts to publish an American stud book for race horses in the United States, similar to the General Stud Book that was published in England documenting the pedigrees of Thoroughbred horses. In February 1837, Porter announced in the Spirit the projected coverage of the project, which was to be edited by Wiley Jones Stratton, who was secretary to the National Jockey Club in Washington, D. C. But this project never materialized, and Porter turned to Patrick Nesbitt Edgar in January 1838 to take over the project. But Edgar did not finish the work, and by 1842, the project was abandoned.Harrison Background of the American Stud Book pp. 42‚Äì47 Title page of the October 1839 edition of American Turf Register, edited by Porter. Porter also served as an arbiter of disputes about sports rules and sports betting. Porter also encouraged new authors from the south and the west to write in his newspaper and helped them get books published. He also edited two collections of short stories from the frontier, The Big Bear of Arkansas in 1846 and A Quarter Race in Kentucky and Other Sketches in 1847. Besides the sporting interests, the Spirit was involved in the emergence of American literature, especially the \\"tall tale\\" form of humor. Porter encouraged Southwestern authors to write and publish their short stories in the Spirit, and was involved in getting their works published in book form. He was the editor for two of these collections: The Big Bear of Arkansas, published in 1846, and A Quarter Race in Kentucky and Other Sketches, published in 1847. Porter was instrumental in encouraging the career of Johnson Hooper. Another writer who contributed to the Spirit was Henry William Herbert, who wrote under the pen name \\"Frank Forester\\". The Panic of 1837 hurt the Spirit's circulation, but Porter responded by buying out his main competition, the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine and moved it to New York City. Porter edited the Turf Register until the paper stopped being published in 1844.Mott History of American Magazines pp. 480‚Äì481 Porter continued the publication of annual stallion lists and the publication of lists of horses owned by breeders.Harrison Background of the American Stud Book p. 33 However, the purchase of the American Turf Register strained Porter's finances, and he sold the Spirit to another printer, John Richards, who retained Porter as editor. The 1840s were prosperous, but in the 1850s the magazine again encountered difficulties. Around 1855, Porter left Richards' paper, and in 1856, another printer, George Wilkes, began a new sporting newspaper, which he called Porter's Spirit of the Times, and employed Porter as editor. Later life In 1845, Porter served as secretary for the New York Jockey Club, during the famous match race between the fillies Fashion and Peytona at the Union Course on May 15, 1845.Robertson History of Thoroughbred Racing in America p. 64 Although the Spirit and the American Turf Register were known for their coverage of horse racing, Porter's main sporting interest for himself was fishing. Porter never married, and three of his brothers died before Porter himself caught a cold and died of consumption on July 19, 1858, in his house in New York City.Staff (July 20, 1858) \\"Death of William T.

The combatants were Apache and Navajo warriors, Spanish soldiers and Tucson militia. Battle After the native raid, known as the Fourth Battle of Tucson, on March 21, 1784, an Apache and Navajo force withdrew to the Catalina Mountains but before making it all the way there, a pursuing group Spaniards and Pimas caught up with them. Reinforced by thirty Pima scouts from the neighboring towns of Tupson and San Xavier, the Spanish force consisted of forty-eight men, including five Tucson citizens, serving as militia, along with twelve men of the remount herd guard. The Spanish and Pima force left Tucson and after only forty-five minutes, caught up with the Navajos and Apaches at the base of the Catalina Mountains, near the Catalina River as it was called at the time. The native army split in two, 400 out of 500 warriors continued up the mountain. The other 100 natives were directed to delay the Spaniards in order to allow the escape of the main Apache and Navajo force. Lieutenant Tom√°s Equrrola's was in command, his troop killed fourteen warriors and wounded many others, among them Chief Chiquito, who was the one who commanded and instigated his followers to raid Tucson. The Spaniards and Pimas suffered an unknown number of casualties themselves. Eventually the remaining 100 natives were routed but when the Spanish cavalry tried to pursue they were unable. The fourteen dead Apaches and or Navajos were decapitated and their heads brought back to Tucson and placed along the presidio walls, as a warning, next to the heads of the three warriors killed in the raid.

The school has a reputation for inclusiveness, according to a San Francisco Chronicle article about helping young people cope with cliques.http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/SOCIAL-STUDIES-Parents-can-help- Peninsula-kids-2912021.php Mid-Pen's colors are maroon and gray and its school nickname is the dragons. History Mid-Pen was founded in 1979 by Phil Bliss and Herman Ohme after Cubberley High School in Palo Alto was closed due to budget cuts. Perceiving a need for alternatives to the public system, Bliss and Ohme began advocating for students experiencing difficulty or dissatisfaction in the public school system or who had undiagnosed learning differences. Ohme began schooling the first three Mid-Pen students in his living room in early 1980. Herman and Bliss soon leased space at the recently closed Cubberley High School and by the end of the 1979‚Äì1980 academic year, the school had 40 students and one graduate. Because Proposition 13 caused many public school districts to abandon summer school, Mid-Peninsula experienced a very high enrollment for summer school in 1980, which translated into more students for the following fall semester. In response to this increased enrollment, the school's founders leased a new Mid-Peninsula High School site on Ross Road in Palo Alto. After five years, this site was scheduled for demolition, so the school relocated to the 870 N. California Avenue campus in Palo Alto. After 15 years, that site was reclaimed by the Palo Alto Unified School District. Mid-Peninsula had its first capital campaign and purchased and remodeled a commercial building at 1340 Willow Road in Menlo Park. It opened to students on January 31, 2001.http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Alumni-sue-to-keep-San-Mateo-High- standing-2871642.php The two-story structure features a large patio, grassy playing field, a gym, art studio, science labs and wireless technology. In 2001, student population was 140 and staff and faculty numbered 21.http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Alumni-sue-to-keep-San-Mateo-High- standing-2871642.php In a letter to the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle (Oct. 6, 2006), Douglas C. Thompson, head of the school, wrote that the goal of a high school should be to support a student-centered process. ‚ÄúSomeone who is eager to try new things, able to work in a group, able to learn about his or her world and able to express in words what he or she has learned, is indeed an educated person. It is sad that we have moved so far away from those simple goals,‚Äù he wrote.http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/LETTERS-TO-THE- EDITOR-2468643.php#page-1 Academics Mid-Peninsula's curriculum meets standards of admission for both the University of California and the California State University institutions as well as private institutions of higher learning. Mid-Pen is fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC)WASC and the California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS). The school focuses on individualized learning approaches and employs flexible programming to accommodate various learning styles and reduce stress. Class sizes are typically smaller than 15 students. Mid-Peninsula's variable credit program grants academic credit based on the quantity of work, while grades are based on the quality of work. Emphasis is placed on personal motivation, character and self-discipline. PrivateSchoolReview.com Athletics Mid-Peninsula is a Division V school, has been a member of the Central Coast Section (CCS) for 20 years, and is also a member of the Private School Athletic League (PSAL). The school has several championships for soccer, baseball and basketball. Mid-Peninsula employs a no-cut policy for all team sports (however, individual playing time is determined by attendance, performance and attitude). Volleyball, soccer and basketball are offered for boys and girls, while baseball is offered for boys and softball is offered for girls. Cross country is co-educational. One of the highlights of the school's baseball roster included Jimmy Barefield, a 6-foot-5 pitcher and infielder from Redwood City who ‚Äúwas on the fast to becoming a poster boy for troubled youth,‚Äù when he arrived at Mid-Pen and became a standout player in 1999.

He taught at Redeemer University College for 30 years, retiring in 2015. His classes built especially on Byzantine History, which lasted for more than 1100 years. Payton believes that this empire needs to be studied by western Christians because of the significant Christian influences which in many ways drove Byzantine history. He taught courses on Eastern Orthodoxy, Eastern European history, and Church history. He has done extensive study on the church fathers and on church history, and he has written numerous articles in all these fields. Payton has written five books. \\"Light from the Christian East: An Introduction to the Orthodox Tradition\\" was published by InterVarsity Press in 2007.

Retrieved on November 19, 2009. was a United States Air Force major general who was the top authority on US air defense from 1940 to 1951. Blunt and direct in manner, Saville had been an outspoken proponent of tactical aviation in the 1930s against a brotherhood of airmen who promoted strategic bombing. Saville succeeded Claire L. Chennault as America's leading fighter aircraft tactician. With Benjamin S. Kelsey, Saville co-wrote the technical specifications which led to the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters. In 1949 he selected the North American F-86 Sabre as America's main defense fighter, and in 1950 he approved a guided air-to-air missile system that would be carried aboard the proposed supersonic 1954 interceptor; the missile produced was the AIM-4 Falcon. Saville was a technical and scientific-minded leader who helped pioneer advanced mathematics for operations research, and computer systems for centralized coordination of air defense. He advocated the expansion of radar installations to create an unbroken air defense network. He explored the concept of a military aircraft designed around an integrated electronics fire-control system built by various subcontractors. Oral history interview of Donald Jacobs by Martin Collins. Summary of tape contents. After retiring from the military, Saville worked in the defense industry. Early career Gordon Philip Saville was born in Macon, Georgia, on September 14, 1902.Official Army Register, 1946. Page 603. \\"Saville, Gordon P.\\" (O17006) Retrieved on November 17, 2009. His Regular Army officer father propelled Saville's older brother to enroll at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he urged Saville to accept an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. However, Saville wanted to fly so he rejected formal military schools. Instead, he attended the University of Washington, Antioch College, and then the University of California and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve on November 5, 1923, in the infantry, seeing active duty in August 1924 and August 1925. While on reserve duty at Crissy Field in San Francisco, Saville watched Army Air Service pilots training on military aircraft. He determined that he would join them or leave the military.Schaffel, 1987 Saville became a flying cadet with the Army Air Service in March 1926, and entered the primary flying school at Brooks Field, Texas. During this time his service branch reformed as the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). In September of that year he was transferred to the advanced flying school at Kelly Field, Texas, from which he graduated on February 28, 1927, gaining a commission as second lieutenant in the Air Reserve. He was assigned to the Fifth Observation Squadron at Mitchel Field, New York and in June 1927, he was appointed a second lieutenant in the Air Corps of the Regular Army. At Mitchel, Saville served ably as adjutant to Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Foulois, but Foulois was unhappy with Saville's absence during weekend train trips to Connecticut to see Ina Isola Hards, his girlfriend. Hards was an honors graduate of Wellesley College where she had performed in theatre plays and had served as class officer. Foulois' wife successfully addressed the problem by inviting Miss Hards to stay at the Foulois home on weekends. Saville married Hards in the Church of Transfiguration in New York City in September 1928; her father, Ira A. Hards, producer of the Mae West Broadway play Diamond Lil, walked her down the aisle. As a wedding present, Foulois granted Saville's request for a transfer back to Crissy Field. Saville was made adjutant of Crissy Field in December 1928. He and his wife produced a daughter in July 1930, Ina Gordon Saville. Later that year Saville transferred to Mather Field, California, where he was appointed adjutant of the field and of the 20th Pursuit Group. The Savilles had a son, Edward A. Saville, in October 1931. In 1932, Saville and family traveled to Barksdale Field, Louisiana, along with the 20th Pursuit Group. Tactics and theory At Foulois' recommendation, Saville entered the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, in August 1933. Saville graduated in May 1934, at the top of his class, and remained at the school as an instructor in the Maps and Photographs Section.Finney, Robert T. (1998) Air Force History and Museums Program. History of the Air Corps Tactical School 1920‚Äì1940. Third imprint. Retrieved on November 19, 2009. At ACTS, Saville joined Claire L. Chennault in favoring an air defense strategy hinging on a strong fighter force. Saville argued against the so-called Bomber Mafia; he did not believe that fleets of bombers were unstoppable, and he considered close coordination between ground units and tactical air power a key part of Army doctrine. In July 1935, at the temporary rank of captain, he was named recorder of the Air Corps Board at Maxwell Field, in addition to his duties as fighter aviation instructor. Saville removed a degree of independent command from fighter squadron leaders who previously could ignore instructions radioed from the ground. Backed by Brigadier General Henry Conger Pratt, Saville's unpopular control methods proved their worth, as ground controllers were often in possession of better information than squadron leaders in flight.Schaffel, 1991, pp. 15‚Äì16 From 1935 to 1937, as Chennault was eased out by the bomber advocates, Saville took his place as the top fighter proponent. Saville avoided Chennault's fate by refraining from disputing the bomber's important role in offensive operations. He felt that the fighter aircraft was undervalued in its defensive role. Saville helped specify the Bell P-39 Airacobra, designed around a large autocannon In February 1937, Saville paired with Lieutenant Benjamin S. Kelsey, Project Officer for Fighters at the USAAC, to find a way to get around the USAAC's arbitrary 500-pound (225 kg) limit on the weight of fighter aircraft armament. The two men settled on the term \\"interceptor\\", creating a new Army classification for fighters, not a new mission. They issued a specification for two new heavily armed fighters via Circular Proposal X-608 and Circular Proposal X-609.Bodie 1991, p. 19 These were requests for fighters having \\"the tactical mission of interception and attack of hostile aircraft at high altitude\\".Bodie 1991, pp. 16‚Äì17 Specifications called for at least of heavy armament including a cannon, one or two liquid-cooled Allison V-1710 engines each with a General Electric turbo-supercharger, tricycle landing gear, a level airspeed of at least at altitude, and a climb to within 6 minutesLockheed P-38 Lightning. Retrieved: 21 January 2007.‚Äîthe toughest set of specifications USAAC had presented to that date.Bodie 1991, p. 14. Brigadier General Benjamin S. Kelsey recalled in 1977 that he and Lieutenant Saville drew up the specification in 1937 using the word \\"interceptor\\" as a way to bypass the inflexible Army Air Corps requirement for pursuit aircraft to carry no more than 500 lb (225 kg) of armament including ammunition. Kelsey was looking for a minimum of 1,000 lb (450 kg) of armament. From these specifications a competition was held, and eventually the single-engine fighter became the Bell Aircraft P-39 Airacobra, and the twin-engine fighter became the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. Saville's rank of captain was made permanent in June 1937. SCR-270 set Saville entered the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in September 1938, and graduated the following June. He then was assigned to Washington, D.C., as assistant to the chief of the Plans Division in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps. He assumed the role of assistant intelligence and operations officer of the Air Defense Command (ADC) at Mitchel Field in March 1940. Led by Brigadier General James E. Chaney, the ADC was tasked with testing various air defense measures to determine what worked. Chaney was unfamiliar with air defense, and he made Saville the coordinator of all projects. This was the first time Saville was able to test and implement his theories on a large scale.Schaffel, 1991, pp. 24‚Äì25 New SCR-270 radar units were tried out and incorporated into the command scheme, giving greater reach to ground controllers. Army maneuvers held at Watertown, New York, in August 1940 allowed Saville to prove that fighter aircraft could protect a domestic target from air attack long before anti-aircraft artillery could fire, a result that Chaney said \\"astonished\\" high-ranking Army observers.Schaffel, 1991, p. 27 In October 1940, Saville flew to London with Chaney for temporary duty as a military air observer studying British air defenses, and returned to Mitchel Field after two months to become executive officer at the temporary rank of major of the First Interceptor Command. He began drafting a comprehensive air defense doctrine which combined features of the British system with those advocated by Chennault and himself. Saville was promoted to the permanent rank of major in February, 1941, and from March 25 to April 12, he conducted an intensive course in air defense given to 60 fighter group staff, including Kenneth P. Bergquist, posted to Hawaii's fighter wing.Schaffel, 1991, p. 32 In August 1941, he returned to London and observed British air defense measures until December 1941. During this time, Saville's Air Defense Doctrine draft was reviewed by the USAAC, but it was not approved or published.Saville's Air Defense Doctrine is on file at the National Archives and Records Administration, Records of the Army Air Forces, AAG 381, Air Defense Doctrines. Saville's proposed defense involved rigorous round-the-clock coordination between ground observers, radar installations, and centralized command posts to filter reports to defense forces consisting of anti-aircraft artillery batteries, barrage balloons, and fighter wings. Unusually, Saville proposed that fighter wings involved in air defense be completely separate from fighter wings making attacks on enemy air forces.Futrell, 1989, p. 107 World War II After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Saville was assigned to United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) headquarters in Washington as director of the country's air defenses, which he considered inadequate. Because of the greatly increased civilian interest in air defense, much of Saville's unpublished air defense doctrine was copied into the War Department's Training Circulars No. 70 and 71, published nine and eleven days after Pearl Harbor, respectively. These training materials emphasized regional command and control of air defenses. Fighter group commanders were to direct the efforts of anti- aircraft artillery officers‚Äîone of Saville's suggestions that had been a sticking point, resisted by artillerists. Before these plans were implemented, British radar pioneer Robert Watson-Watt surveyed West Coast defenses and found them \\"dangerously unsatisfactory\\", a confirmation of Saville's assessment. Saville found Watson-Watt's report \\"a damning indictment of our whole warning service.\\" Saville was made lieutenant colonel on January 5, 1942. In tackling the problem of air defense of the Panama Canal Zone, he brought together civilian mathematicians and military defense experts to organize the first operations research group in the Air Corps, following two such groups formed by the Navy.McArthur, Charles W. Operations analysis in the U.S. Army Eighth Air Force in World War II, pp. 5. AMS Bookstore, 1990. Saville was promoted to brigadier general on November 2. Once it was clear that U.S. territory was not in danger of being attacked by enemy air units, Saville's expertise in air defense was not needed. In March 1943, he was made director of tactical development at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) at Orlando, Florida, where he reorganized the Army Air Forces Board by July 2, 1943. Saville's structure put tactical and strategic development on equal footing, and tied together the efforts of the Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC&R;), the Proving Ground Command and the School of Applied Tactics.Futrell, 1989, p. 137 Saville charged the AAFSAT with developing air defense doctrines and tactics, and with the testing of air defense equipment and methods.Futrell, 1989, p. 133 Saville thought Operation Tidal Wave was a \\"suicidal\\" plan. Later that month he was ordered to the North African theater, where he served as chief of staff of the Mediterranean Air Command. Under Carl Andrew Spaatz, Saville argued against the plans for Operation Tidal Wave in August, the air attack on oil refineries in Ploie≈üti. After the operation resulted in heavy American casualties with little effect on oil production, Saville described it as a \\"goddamned thing... ridiculous and suicidal.\\"Orange, Vincent. Tedder: Quietly in Command, p. 231. Routledge, 2004. General officer conference on Corsica in June 1944: Saville (left) joins Jacob L. Devers and John K. Cannon in planning the invasion of Southern France In October 1943, he was appointed commander of the XII Fighter Command (XXII Tactical Air Command), and in January 1944 was named deputy commander of the XII Air Support Command (XII Tactical Air Command) in the Mediterranean. There, Saville achieved close coordination between air power and the infantry. Tactics used by Saville were employed again during the Normandy Invasion, with fighter aircraft clearing enemy units from roads behind the front lines. He took part in Operation Strangle, the effort to deny roads and rail to German supply columns. In this, Saville was critical of the inaccuracy of high-altitude bombing; he wrote privately to a friend in April, \\"Our waste of effort in trying to hit railroad tracks and bridges is simply fantastic.\\" Saville was promoted to major general on June 30, 1944, distinguishing himself during Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France.Schaffel, 1991, p. 84 He assumed command of the First Tactical Air Force in January 1945. The following month, Saville returned to the United States for temporary assignment to USAAF headquarters, and in March 1945 became commander of the III Tactical Air Command at Barksdale Field. Two months later, he was appointed deputy commander of Air Transport Command at Washington. Cold War In January 1947, Saville was sent to Brazil to serve as chief of the Air Section of the Joint Brazil ‚Äì United States Military Commission, stationed at the American Embassy at Rio de Janeiro. Saville took his family with him to Brazil; he enrolled his daughter in the American School of Rio de Janeiro, where she graduated high school in June. During this time the USAAF reformed as an independent service branch; United States Air Force (USAF). Muir S. Fairchild urged Saville to rework U.S. air defenses In May 1948, Muir S. Fairchild was made vice chief of staff of the USAF. In light of the developing Cold War and the threat of Soviet long-range bombers, Fairchild determined that Saville's expertise was critically needed. Fairchild ordered Saville, the top U.S. authority on air defense and a scientifically minded pragmatist, to return stateside in June 1948, for assignment to the ADC headquarters at Mitchel Air Force Base.Neufeld, 1990, p. 67 Saville evaluated the ambitious Radar Fence Plan of Major General Francis L. Ankenbrandt, which had recently failed in Congress because it was too expensive in manpower and material, and would take too long to put in place. Fairchild and Saville determined to devise a more practical radar defense plan, one that would bypass the slow approval methods previously established.Schaffel, 1991, p. 90 In pushing his plan to fruition, Saville angered other officers who expected to have a say in air defense; he said, \\"I wasn't going to stand in line and wait.\\"Schaffel, 1991, pp. 91‚Äì92 He first focused on a foundation of radar systems, and concluded that the U.S. should spend $116 million in 1949 and 1950, to build 75 radar sites and 20 control centers in the continental U.S., with 10 more radar sites facing the Soviet Union from the Territory of Alaska, controlled through a territorial center. The radar sites would primarily be composed of older World War II-era microwave units, but these would be augmented by a few advanced radar units, carefully positioned. Dubbed the \\"Lashup\\" planSchaffel, 1991, p. 94 (from \\"lash-up\\", meaning \\"hastily improvised\\"), it was about 20% of the cost of Ankenbrandt's Radar Fence Plan, and it was more flexible in terms of future expansion. In September, Saville told Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington, and the assembled Air Force staff that America's air defenses were wholly inadequate. The Chiefs of Staff agreed that air defense was second in importance only to a strong retaliation force, one that would give pause to an aggressor.Schaffel, 1991, p. 95 In November, Saville was named commanding general of ADC. He worked to combine it with Tactical Air Command (TAC) to form the backbone of the Continental Air Command (CONAC) organization. In February 1949, Saville updated the House Armed Services Committee on the necessity of radar air defense, and in March the Lashup plan was approved by Congress.Schaffel, 1991, p. 98 Bruce K. Holloway helped Saville with fighter defenses Earlier, in mid-1948, Saville asked Colonel Bruce K. Holloway to evaluate existing fighter aircraft defense capabilities. Holloway teamed with Major General William E. Kepner, commander of the Air Proving Ground at Eglin Air Force Base, to measure interceptor performance under realistic conditions. Tests showed that the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star and the North American F-82 Twin Mustang, then in service, were completely inadequate to stop high-altitude bomber attacks at night or in bad weather. Fairchild learned of this failure and formed a team to evaluate two prototype interceptors, the Northrop XP-89 Scorpion and the Curtiss-Wright XP-87 Blackhawk, in October 1948. As a member of the team, Holloway was disappointed with the performance of the prototypes, and he recommended that both aircraft be refused for air defense. Fairchild canceled the Curtiss machine but the Northrop, the \\"best of a poor lot\\", was pushed into immediate service.Schaffel, 1991, p. 100 Holloway and Saville agreed that America needed a fighter that could take off under \\"zero-zero\\" conditions of no visibility, and they felt that such a design should be in production by 1954, when the Soviets were expected to have fleets of bombers.Schaffel, 1991, p. 99 Until then, an interim solution was sought. In a May 1949 meeting of the USAF Senior Officers Board, Saville recommended that the North American F-86 Sabre be procured in quantity, as it was in his opinion the best available American all-weather fighter for air defense.Futrell, 1989, p. 245 The government quickly ordered 124 F-86Ds, as a start.Green, 2010, p. 161 In April 1949, General Ennis Whitehead was put in charge of CONAC. He devised his own command methods rather than those established by Saville, making Saville redundant in his role as air defense chief. In support of Saville, Colonel Jacob E. Smart, assistant to USAF Commander Henry H. Arnold, wrote that Saville's unorthodox methods since the end of World War II provided \\"the only tangible results toward building an air defense system\\" of any worth.Schaffel, 1991, pp. 103‚Äì104 Smart said that Saville, though a \\"thorn in the side to many people\\", should be credited for all recent air defense progress in the U.S. Saville was moved from air defense operations to long-range planning and research. In September 1949, Arnold appointed Saville head of the newly established Directorate of Requirements in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations at USAF headquarters. The following January, Saville became deputy chief of staff for Development, Air Research and Development Command, a new staff section at USAF headquarters. To equip the U.S. with a fighter that could defend against the new threat of Soviet nuclear bombers, Saville initiated a design competition for a fire-control system (FCS) codenamed MX-1179, the basis of a guided air-to-air missile system simple enough that it could be operated alone by the pilot of a supersonic fighter rather than by a weapons officer. The proposed fighter concept was referred to as the 1954 interceptor, resulting directly in the 1956 Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, and several other fighter models indirectly. Saville was less concerned with the aircraft details than with the weapons system; regarding the FCS he said, \\"when that system is developed, we're going to put aluminum around it, engines on it, and a pilot to run the aluminum, and that is the interceptor.\\" As quoted from the Army, Navy, Air Force Register. Early and later models of the AIM-4 Falcon From a handful of company designs, Saville selected Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, to lay out the desired strategy of the weapons system and to describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville.Schaffel, 1991, p. 188 The Falcon was used successfully for more than a decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around a weapons system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra around a large autocannon, but he further refined the concept and made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.Green, 2010, p. 162 In early 1950, Saville served on the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a military and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, as well as the development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC.Neufeld, 1990, p. 79 Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based ballistic missiles, which became the focus of the committee. Saville and Fairchild went to Congress in 1950, and obtained $114 million for the development of an electronic computer-based air defense system, a project headed by George E. Valley Jr, who was a physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Green, Tom. Bright Boys: 1938‚Äì1958. \\"Whirlwind finally earns its wings... sort of.\\" Retrieved on November 19, 2009. The computer, named Whirlwind, helped the USAF develop the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system. In March 1950, Fairchild died. Fairchild had been Saville's champion in the USAF, and Saville had used Fairchild's influence as a shield to \\"get things done\\", according to Smart. In the process, Saville had made enough enemies in the Air Staff that he realized Fairchild's absence would greatly limit his career advancement. He began planning his retirement, finishing ongoing projects, and first selecting then grooming his replacement: Brigadier General Laurence C. Craigie.Schaffel, 1991, p. 175 In June 1950, Saville gave a lecture on air defense at the Air War College, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, telling the students that the optimal air defense system as he envisaged might be able to destroy 60% of an attacking bomber force, but that realistic results would be closer to 30% reduction. He emphasized the need for better intelligence regarding Soviet offensive airpower capabilities, to increase the accuracy of air defense predictions.Futrell, 1989, p. 353Schaffel, 1991, p. 129 In late 1950, USAF Chief Scientist Louis Ridenour initiated Project Charles at MIT to study problems of air defense. The study determined that Valley's methods were the best option. In May 1951, the project was reformed as Project Lincoln to investigate unusual reconnaissance methods; this group met at Beacon Hill, Boston, and became known as the Beacon Hill Study Group. Saville expanded the group by naming 15 men to the project, all experts in their fields, including Edwin H. Land, James Gilbert Baker, Edward Mills Purcell, Richard Scott Perkin and USAF Colonel Richard S. Leghorn. The project led to the establishment of Lincoln Laboratory, a research and development project of the Defense Department. Civilian career In the Army, Navy, Air Force Journal, Saville announced the engagement of his daughter Ina Gordon Saville to James R. Pitts, a cadet at West Point. Ina graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1951, with a degree in English, then married Pitts on June 17. In July 1951, Saville retired from the USAF.Air Force Historical Research Agency. Saville, Gordon Philip papers. 1920‚Äì1951. Retrieved on November 19, 2009. Thule Air Force Base was one of the larger bases Saville approved to increase America's air defenses. Saville was invited to join a November 1952 experimental commercial flight from Los Angeles to Copenhagen, flying to Denmark in a Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) DC-6B named Arild Viking, stopping first in Edmonton, Canada, then at the newly operational Thule Air Force Base in Greenland, which Saville had previously approved for major construction. The 28-hour, flight plan pioneered a polar route for SAS. Saville accompanied Colonel Bernt Balchen, the Norwegian-born commander of Thule AFB. In 1953, Saville wrote a feature for Air Force Magazine, describing a strong air defense as one of the essential elements for preventing wars. He said \\"only a fool would run into a hornet's nest of opposition.\\"Futrell, 1989, p. 333 However, he emphasized that a perfect air defense could never succeed in preventing an attack by itself, only in blunting it. A powerful counterattack force was required. In December 1954, Saville celebrated the marriage of his airman son Edward to Lettice Lee von Selzam, a debutante from Wisconsin. Saville's younger son John served as best man. Edward was a lieutenant in the USAF, and among the eight ushers were five other USAF lieutenants. Saville was hired in November 1954, to work for Ramo-Wooldridge, a company that formed from the FCS team at Hughes. Saville was made Director of Military Requirements, a new position tailored to his unique background. In this liaison role, Saville met regularly with military leaders to ensure that Ramo-Wooldridge projects answered America's defense needs. When Thompson Products merged with Ramo-Woodridge to form TRW, Saville became vice president of the new company. Saville retired in 1963, and became a consultant to TRW and to other government agencies. In the mid-1960s Saville invested in cattle ranches, embarking upon what he called a \\"third career\\" as a cattle rancher. He was invited to participate in a panel discussion at the annual Conference on World Affairs in 1966. Death and legacy Saville died on January 31, 1984. His ashes are interred at Arlington National Cemetery. His wife, Ina Hards Saville, died in 1995, and her ashes joined Saville's. In his career, Saville was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star Medal and the Air Medal. He was rated a Command Pilot, Combat Observer, Aircraft Observer and Technical Observer. Saville's daughter Ina bore four daughters in the 1950s, and died in 2005. Saville's son Edward produced two sons and a daughter. He retired from the USAF at the rank of lieutenant colonel and lives in Beaufort, South Carolina; his wife \\"Letty\\" died in 2000.

Though never a member of the Nazi Party and a recognized researcher before the war, Schilling became notorious as a consequence of his unethical and inhumane participation in human research under both Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. From 1942 to 1945, Schilling's research of malaria and attempts at fighting it using synthetic drugs resulted in over a thousand cases of human experimentation on camp prisoners. Sentenced to death by hanging after the fall of Hitler's Germany, he was executed for his crimes against the Dachau prisoners in 1946. Biography Born in Munich on 5 July 1871, Schilling studied medicine in his native city, receiving a doctor's degree there in 1895. He was a professor of parasitology at the University of Berlin and a member of Malaria Commission of the League of Nations.Marcus J. Smith: Dachau: The Harrowing of Hell, SUNY Press, 2012, p. 178 Within a few years, Schilling was practicing in the German colonial possessions in Africa. Recognized for his contributions in the field of tropical medicine, he was appointed the first-ever director of the tropical medicine division of the Robert Koch Institute in 1905, where he would remain for the subsequent three decades. Italian research Upon retirement from the Robert Koch Institute in 1936, Schilling moved to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy, where he was given the opportunity to conduct immunization experiments on inmates of the psychiatric asylums of Volterra and San Niccol√≤ di Siena.Hulverscheidt, Marion. \\"German Malariology Experiments with Humans, Supported by the DFG Until 1945\\". Man, Medicine, and the State: The Human Body as an Object of Government Sponsored Medical Research in the 20th Century, Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft Volume 2. Ed. Wolfgang Uwe Eckhart. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 2006. , , pp. 221‚Äì236. (The Italian authorities were concerned that troops faced malaria outbreaks in the course of the Italo-Ethiopian War.) As Schilling stressed the significance of the research for German interests, the Nazi government of Germany also supported him with a financial grant for his Italian experimentation. Dachau experiments Schilling returned to Germany after a meeting with Leonardo Conti, the Nazis' Health Chief, in 1941, and by early 1942 he was provided with a special malaria research station at Dachau's concentration camp by Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS. Despite negative assessments from colleagues, Schilling would remain in charge of the malaria station for the duration of the war. Czech priest, Friedrich Hoffman, testifies at the trial of former camp personnel and prisoners from Dachau concentration camp. In his hand he holds records showing that hundreds of priests died at the camp after being exposed to malaria during Nazi medical experiments. Although in the 1930s Schilling had stressed the point that malaria research on human subjects could be performed in an entirely harmless fashion, the Dachau subjects included prisoners who were injected with synthetic drugs at doses ranging from high to lethal. They had been exposed to malaria mosquitos in cages strapped to their hands or arms so as to ensure infection with the parasite. Of the more than 1,000 prisoners used in the malaria experiments at Dachau during the war, between 300 and 400 died as a result; among survivors, a substantial number remained permanently injured. A number of priests imprisoned by the Nazis were killed during the experiments. In the course of the Dachau Trials following the liberation of the camp at the close of the war, Schilling was tried by a U.S. General Military Court, appointed at 2 November 1945, in the case of The United States versus Martin Gottfried Weiss, Wilhelm Rupert, et al. The defendants, 40 doctors and staff, were charged and convicted of offenses of the violations of laws and usages of war in that they acted in pursuance of a common design, did encourage, aid, abet, and participate in the subjection of Allied nationals and prisoners of war to cruelties and mistreatments at Dachau Concentration Camp and its subcamps.Spitz, Vivien. Doctors from Hell: The Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on Humans. Boulder, Colorado: Sentient Publications, 2005. , , p. 104-112. According to the August H. Vieweg testimony, the patients used in the malaria experiments were Poles, Russians, and Yugoslavs. At that time there was no formal code of ethics in medical research to which the judges could hold the accused Nazi doctors accountable. The \\"scientific experiments\\" exposed during the trials lead to the Nuremberg Code, developed in 1949 as a ten-point code of human experimentation ethics. The tribunal sentenced Schilling to death by hanging on 13 December 1945. His execution took place at Landsberg Prison in Landsberg am Lech on 28 May 1946. The execution was filmed by military personnel, who recorded Schilling's ascending the gallows and his hanging, (Approx. minutes 2:20 to 3:15) along with a coffin marked \\"Dr Schilling, Claus.\\" (Approx. minutes 5:30 to 5:45) References External links Schilling execution 1871 births 1946 deaths Dachau concentration camp personnel Dachau trials executions Executed people from Bavaria Nazi human subject research Physicians from Munich Physicians in the Nazi Party People from the Kingdom of Bavaria ","title":"Claus Schilling"},{"id":"25136466","text":"A.

During Ottoman rule of Skopje, the Old Bazaar developed rapidly to become city's main centre of commerce. The Ottoman history of the bazaar is evidenced by roughly thirty mosques, numerous caravanserais and hans, among other buildings and monuments. The bazaar was heavily damaged by the earthquake in 1555, the burning of the city in 1689, the earthquake in 1963, as well as during the First and the Second World Wars and faced various rebuildings following these events. Beside its importance as a market place, the Old Bazaar is known for its cultural and historical values. Although Ottoman architecture is predominant, remains of Byzantine architecture are evident as well, while recent reconstructions have led to the application of elements specific to modern architecture. The Old Bazaar is still home to several active mosques, t√ºrbes, two churches and a clocktower, that, together with the buildings of the Museum of the Republic of North Macedonia and the Museum of Modern Art, form the core of the modern bazaar. In recent years there have been a raising interest to make the Bazaar a touristic attraction.

Following the fall of the city of Scupi under Roman rule, numerous Roman buildings, such as temples, thermaes, and theatres were built inside the city, that subsequently promoted it as an important religious and cultural centre in the Roman Empire.

VI, Scupi et la r√©gion de Kumanovo, Beograd, 1982. Nevertheless, the local population settled up on a hilly area, where, later, the emperor Justinian ordered the construction of the Kale Fortress. During the reign of king Samuel, Skopje was given a particular strategic, political, economic, and cultural importance, so that the surrounding area of the Kale hill was embanked by the enactment of defensive walls, in order to keep the treasures that were present in the settlement. At the time, there was a gate named \\"Watertower Gate\\", which was built with the purpose to defend the city against the successive attacks by the Byzantine emperor Basil II in 1001.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—Å–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–≥–ª–µ–¥ –æ–¥ –Ω–∞—ò—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ –¥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞—Å—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –°–∞–º–æ–∏–ª–æ–≤–æ—Ç–æ —Ü–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ , –ü—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç ‚Äû–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∞ —Å–∫–æ–ø—Å–∫–∞ —á–∞—Ä—à–∏—ò–∞‚Äú.  Middle Ages  = Byzantine rule = After the fall of the First Bulgarian Empire under Byzantine rule in 1018, the emperor Basil II transformed Skopje into a capital of a theme and an episcopal see, whose bishop was elected for a four-year term. Following the death of Basil, his successor, Romanos III Argyros, undertook activities to reconstruct the Monastery of St. Georgi, which was situated on the place where today the Sultan Murad Mosque is located. It is said that the monastery, at the time, was one of the most reputable and decorated monasteries in most of the Balkans.–ù–∞—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—É–≤–∞—ö–µ –Ω–∞ —á–∞—Ä—à–∏—ò–∞—Ç–∞ –≤–æ XI –∏ XII –≤–µ–∫, –ü—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç ‚Äû–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∞ —Å–∫–æ–ø—Å–∫–∞ —á–∞—Ä—à–∏—ò–∞‚Äú. With the coming to power of the Komnenni dynasty in the beginning of the 12th century, the city lived a relatively calm period and saw significant development. The development was followed by construction of walls and defense towers around Dolengrad, monasteries and churches. Strong development contributed to the city to take the position of an important trading center which was visited by merchants from many other places like Dubrovnik and Republic of Venice. = Serbian rule = In 1282, the Serbian King Stefan Uros II Milutin conquered Skopje, the city became a part of Raska and later within the medieval Serbian state. This period is characterized by the construction of numerous churches, monasteries and palaces in and around the city. During his stay in Skopje in 1299 and 1300, the Byzantine envoy Theodore Metochites noted that apart Gorengrad, there was Dolengrad, which was protected by walls. King Stefan Dusan In 1345 Skopje was declared the capital of Serbian Kingdom by Stefan Dusan. The following year he was crowned king in Skopje. During this time the area of bazaar was a particular shopping center, but the city generally stated as the main trade center with developed crafts, where a special role had merchants from Dubrovnik and Republic of Venice. In addition it is possible that today's Sultan Murat mosque is located in the exact place where Dushan's royal palace was. After the death of Stefan Dusan, the city was under Serbian rule until 1385 when Vuk Brankovic surrendered to the Ottomans and Skopje became part of the Ottoman Empire. = Ottoman Period = Mustafa Pasha Mosque The conquest by the Ottoman Turks rapidly began to change the ethnic composition of the Skopje. The wealth with which handled the local churches, monasteries, and the population itself passed into the hands of the Turks. The city transformed into a military stronghold and the construction of several buildings of religious character changed the architecture of the city. A number of typical Ottoman buildings were built immediately after the conquest. Those objects were built primarily to serve Muslim population. Major changes to the architectural character of the current Old Bazaar occurred during governorship of Ishak Beg and his son Isa Bey. Ishak Beg began construction of Sultan Murad Mosque, which construction was completed in 1436. In 1438 began construction of Ishak Beg Mosque and the mausoleum where Ishak Beg was buried. After his death his son and successor, Isa Beg, constructed numerous buildings in what is today Old Bazaar. These buildings, constructed between 1445 and 1469, were indispensable for the economic development of the city. Thus, during this time Skopje saw new buildings like Bezisten and √áifte Hamam. After the death of Isa Beg, in accordance with his testament was built Isa Beg Mosque (1475) and later Haji- kasamova mosque (1489‚Äì1490) and Mustafa Pasha Mosque (1492). In the period from 1489 to 1497 Daut Pasha, Grand Vesir of East Rumelia, invested in the construction of several buildings in the bazaar, among which the most famous is Daut Pasha Hamam. At the same time were built imarets i.e. public houses where food was prepared and served to the homeless and travelers who have stayed in the city. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Bazaar reached its urban and economic zenith, developing into one of the greatest oriental bazaars in the Balkans. The accelerated development of trade and the construction of new stores and facilities continued further. In 1504, near the bazaar, Yahya Pasha built Yahya Pasha Mosque which still survives today. Kur≈üumli Han inn was built in the middle of the century, and in 1543 began the construction of the Church of the Ascension of Jesus, which was the first Christian project that was approved during the Ottoman period in Skopje. The strong earthquake which struck in Skopje 1555, caused massive damage in the bazaar, but the city soon recovered and continued unimpeded development of trade. During this time most of trade took place thanks to the influential Jewish colony and other colonies were created like that of merchants from Dubrovnik. Modern period =Yugoslavia= There are preserved important buildings of the Ottoman period within the Old Bazaar. The buildings have undergone changes in their social, religious and cultural usage such as mosques that were linked with madrassas, caravansaries, libraries, water fountains and burial chambers. Following the 1963 earthquake, urban planners pursued a museification of the area reserving it mainly for foreign visitors and ideological reasons for doing so were based upon Yugoslav socialism and its understandings of secularism and modernity. =Independent Macedonia= For some months following the inter-ethnic conflict of 2001, Macedonians were cautious and hesitant to stroll around the Old Bazaar as the place is associated with criminality, uncleanliness and Albanians. From 2005 onward ƒåair municipality outlined a vision for the capital city's historic core and implemented policies that promoted the revival of the Old Bazaar to its former Ottoman state with specific boundaries for the area. Its initiatives include the refurbishment of the area's historical architecture, inaugurating a Jazz festival, opening a House of the esnaf (professional guilds with Ottoman era origins) and reserving a hall for the arts and music. The urban planners of ƒåair, mainly Albanians, view the Old Bazaar as characterised by its Ottoman heritage and identity that was neglected or destroyed by architects from the Yugoslav and post Yugoslav eras. The local Turkish community of Skopje has significantly contributed to the history of the Old Bazaar and supported initiatives for the refurbishment of Skopje's historical core associated with the Ottoman period. Due to five centuries of Ottoman rule the old Bazaar is still filled with preserved Ottoman style buildings, narrow cobblestone walkways, many mosques and small craftsmen shops. The Old Bazaar is a travel destination for tourists from overseas. = Public Opinion = Different perspectives based on community experiences of the space exists among Albanians and Macedonians of the history of the Old Bazaar. For local Albanians, the Yugoslav era and its socialist understanding of architectural modernism resulted in neglect and failure to properly restore Ottoman religious heritage in the area. Tourism existed and the area economically benefited until the Yugoslav financial crisis of the 1980s. Following independence in 1991, the political elite in power took a nationalist path and as the Old Bazaar is perceived as Albanian it was allowed to decay. A refurbishment initiative during the 1990s on the Old Stone Bridge prevented people from crossing the structure and it resulted in negative economic effects for many craftsmen of the Old Bazaar. Following the 2001 conflict and the 2004 redrawing process of municipality borders, against a backdrop of limited state funds the Old Bazaar has flourished once again due to a proactive mayor, municipal actions and initiatives resulting in new urban development. For local Macedonians the Old Bazaar of the 1960s was industrious, lively, disorderly and a multiethnic place where Macedonians, Albanians, Turks and Romani lived, traded and worked alongside each other. Over a span of twenty to thirty years the area underwent a demographic change of Albanisation and it became reflected in the usage of the Latin alphabet and Albanian writing in shops of the Old Bazaar. At the beginning of the 1990s the Old Bazaar was associated with Albanian criminality and the black market. Toward the end of the decade the Old Bazaar was still a popular place for Macedonian youth to socialise with friends. The historical core of Skopje was viewed as more aesthetically pleasing unlike the southern half of the capital with its socialist era buildings. Many cafes and restaurants existed and received visits from the few foreigners working in Macedonia. The conflict of 2001 was the turning point as Macedonians abandoned the Old Bazaar for the right bank of the river Vardar, especially after new restaurants and bars opened in that area. Following those transformations the Old Bazaar gained an Albanian character. Landmarks Bezisten Bezisten Skopje's bezisten, a covered market, was built in the 15th century by Gazi Ishak Bey, the Sultan's Skopje regent. It was destroyed by a fire in 1689 and was later rebuilt. The bezisten has looked the same since its renovation in 1899. Clock tower Skopje's clock tower, built in the 16th century on the foundations of an older edifice, is located just north of the Sultan Murad Mosque. Originally built of wood, the top was replaced with bricks in 1902.GoMacedonia The hexagonal tower was heavily damaged during the 1963 earthquake. It was soon fully repaired. ƒåifte Hamam √áifte Hamam The ƒåifte Hamam (Turkish for 'double bath'), located in the centre of the old bazaar, was built in the 15th century under Isa Bey. The building is divided into two wings (hence the name 'double'): one for men and one for women. The layout of both sections are nearly identical.skopje.mk The ƒåifte Hamam was used as a bathhouse until 1915. After suffering damages during the 1963 earthquake, it was repaired and has housed the Contemporary Art Gallery since then.In Your Pocket Daut Pasha Hamam Daut Pasha, Grand Vesir of East Rumelia, constructed this hamam in the 15th century. The building consists of fifteen rooms covered by thirteen domes. The two largest domes covered the two changing rooms and the rest of the domes covered individual bathing rooms.In Your Pocket Since 1948, the Daut Pa≈üa Hamam has housed the National Art Gallery. Isa Bey Mosque Situated on the outskirts of the bazaar, this mosque was built as a memorial for Isa Bey after his death. The mosque has two dominant domes and five smaller ones above the porch area. Ishak Bey Mosque Ishak Bey Mosque Also known as the Decorated (Alad≈æa) Mosque because of the floral decorations, inscriptions and coloured tiles found on its walls, the Ishak Bey Mosque was constructed in 1438 in the northern part of the Old Bazaar. The mosque's minaret rises 30 meters (98.4 feet). There is a t√ºrbe located behind the mosque.In Your Pocket Within this mosque was one of the first Islamic libraries in Europe.\\"AT-TAFSƒ™R AL-KABƒ™R\\". The European Library. Kale Fortress Located on the highest hill in Skopje, overlooking the city and the river, the area upon which the fortress was built was first inhabited in prehistoric times, according to archaeological findings.http://www.skopje.mk/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=18&Itemid;=21 Most researchers believe that the fortress was first constructed in the 11th century. Kapan Han Kapan Han One of the three remaining caravanserais in the Old Bazaar, the Kapan Han was built in the 15th century. The rooms in the upper floor were available to guests, while the ground floor was used as a stable to house the guests' horses and cattle.In Your Pocket Kur≈°umli Han Kur≈üumli Han The largest of the three remaining caravanserais, the Kur≈°umli Han (Turkish for 'Lead Inn') was built by Musein Odza, the son of a scientist at Sultan Selim II's court, in the 16th century.skopje.mk The roof of the inn was once covered in lead (hence the name), but was removed during World War I. The Kur≈°umli Han also has several small pyramidically-shaped domes. The building has a ground floor, which housed the cattle and horses, and a first floor, which housed the guests. The attached mosque, built in the 17th century, and most of the hamam, built in the 15th century, were destroyed in the 1963 earthquake. Today, the former han houses the statue collection of the Museum of the Republic of North Macedonia.In Your Pocket Mustafa Pasha Mosque The Mustafa Pasha Mosque, built in 1492 by Mustafa Pasha on an older Christian site,GoMacedonia stands above the Old Bazaar, near Kale Fortress. Considered one of the most elegant Islamic buildings in Macedonia, the complex includes the mosque, the tomb of Mustapha Pa≈üa, the sarcophagus of one of his daughters, a fountain, and remnants of other buildings. The mosque is square in shape and its largest dome is 16 metres (52.5 feet) in diameter. The porch is positioned on four marble pillars, decorated with stalactite, and covered by three small domes. The interior is decorated and includes calligraphic inscriptions. The minaret of Mustafa Pa≈üa Mosque, rising 42 metres (137.8 feet)In Your Pocket is made of limestone. Mustafa Pasha is buried in the hexagonal marble t√ºrbe covered by a dome above a short eight-sided tambour. Umi, one of his four daughters, is buried in the decorated sarcophagus which includes Persian inscriptions on two of the four walls. The mosque courtyard is filled with roses and, due to its elevated location, offers a distinct view of the Old Bazaar. Church of the Holy Salvation Entrance to the Church of Holy Salvation in Skopje Constructed in the 19th century on the foundations of an older church, half of the church was built underground as it was illegal under Ottoman rule for Christian buildings to be taller than Islamic buildings so mosques could dominate the city skyline. The church got its present appearance in the 19th century. The church's iconstasis was carved in wood and is 10 metres (32.8 feet) long, 4.5 to 7 metres (14.8 to 23 feet) in height. Revolutionary Goce Delƒçev is buried in a white stone sarcophagus in the church's courtyard.Exploring Macedonia Stone Bridge Stone Bridge at night The Stone Bridge, across the Vardar River, connects the Old Bazaar to Macedonia Square in the new part of the city. The bridge, built in the 15th century under Sultan Murad, was built of stone blocks as its name suggests, which has helped it survive the fires and earthquakes Skopje has seen. The Stone Bridge has had the same appearance since it was first built. The bridge has 12 semicircular arches and is 214 metres (702 feet) long. During Ottoman rule, countless executions were conducted on the Stone Bridge.GoMacedonia Suli Han The Suli Han was built under Ishak Bey in the 15th century. It has two floors with the upper having 54 rooms for the guests and the lower for the guests' cattle. It was fully repaired after sustaining heavy damaged during the 1963 earthquake.skopje.mk The han today houses the Skopje Academy of Art and the Old Bazaar Museum. Sultan Murad Mosque Sultan Murad built this mosque in 1463, just south of where the clock tower would be built. The mosque has remained mostly undamaged through the fires and earthquakes Skopje has sustained. The Sultan Murad Mosque is rectangular in shape, with a porch including four columns with decorated caplets, connected by arcades. Bit Pazar Bit Pazar Bit Pazar is part of the wider area of the ƒåar≈°ija or Old Bazaar. Skopje's largest market, Bit Pazar is located next to the Old Bazaar proper and retained its multi-ethnic and multi-lingual environment where rural people come to sell farming produce and locals conduct business. During 2007-2008 a gate was built called the \\"Ottoman door\\" to separate the ƒåar≈°ija and increase its individuality from Bit Pazar. Skanderbeg Square An existing statue of Skanderbeg, an important historical figure to ethnic Albanians, is the main fixture of a square that bears his name located at the entrance to Skopje's Old Bazaar. The square's total cost is estimated at around 10 million euros and was completed in 2018. The square covers 28,000 m2 (301,389 ft2) and extends from the Macedonian Philharmonic and Macedonian Opera to the Old Bazaar. To accommodate construction a portion of the square was built on top of Goce Delƒçev Boulevard. Aside from plenty open space, the square contains an amphitheatre, a fountain, and underground parking.

Nevertheless, it is more convenient to follow the prevailing custom among modern writers, and call him Thaletas. (Greek: ŒòŒ±Œª·øÜœÇ or ŒòŒ±ŒªŒÆœÑŒ±œÇ) was an early Greek musician and lyric poet.  Biography   Historicity  The position of Thaletas is one of the most interesting, and at the same time most difficult points, in that most interesting and difficult subject, the early history of Greek music and poetry. The most certain fact known of him is that he introduced from Crete into Sparta certain principles or elements of music and rhythm, which did not exist in Terpander's system, and thereby founded the second of the musical schools which flourished at Sparta.(Plut. de Mus. 9, p. 1135, b.) He was a native of Crete, and, according to the best writers, of the city of Gortyna.(Polymnes tus, ap. Paus. I. c. ; Plut. de Mus. I. c.) Suidas has preserved other traditions, which assigned him to Cnossus or to Elyrus. comp. Meursius, Cret. i. 9 ; K'uster, ad loe.; Miiller, Hist. Lit. of Greece, vol. i. p. 159.)  In Sparta  In compliance, according to tradition, with an invitation which the Spartans sent to him in obedience to an oracle, he removed to Sparta, where, by the sacred character of his paeans, and the humanizing influence of his music, he appeased the wrath of Apollo, who had visited the city with a plague, and composed the factions of the citizens, who were at enmity with each other.(Paus. I. c.; Pint. Lycurg. 4 ; Ephorus, ap. Strab. x. pp. 480, 482 ; Sext. Empir. adv. ffitet. ii. p. 292, Fabric.; Aelian. V. H. xii. 50.) At Sparta he became the head of a new school (katastasis) of music, which appears never afterwards to have been supplanted, and the influence of which was maintained also by Xenodamus of Cythera, Xenocritus of Locris, Polymnestus of Colophon, and Sacadas of Argos.(Plut. de Mus. I. c.) How uncertain were the traditions followed by the generality of the ancient writers respecting the date of Thaletas, is manifest from the statements of Suidas, that he lived before the time of Homer, of Demetrius Magnes,(ap, Diog. Lae'rt. i. 38) that he was \\"very ancient, about the time of Hesiod and Homer and Lycurgus,\\" and of the many other writers, who make him contemporary with Lycurgus, and even an elder contemporary. In nearly all the accounts of the removal of Thaletas to Sparta, he is said to have gone thither at the invitation of Lycurgus, who used his influence to prepare the minds of the people for his own laws; while some even speak of him as if he were a legislator, from whom Lycurgus derived some of his laws.(Sext. Empir. I. c.; Arist. Pol. ii. 9. ¬ß 5, ii. 12.) These accounts, which Aristotle condemns as anachronisms, can easily be explained. The influence of music upon character and manners was in the opinion of the ancients so great, that it was quite natural to speak of Terpander and Thaletas as fellow-workers with the great legislator of the Spartans informing the character of the people. Moreover, in the case of Thaletas, the supposed connection with Lycurgus would assume a more probable appearance on account of his coming from Crete, from whence also Lycurgus was supposed to have derived so many of his institutions; and this is, in fact, the specific form which the tradition assumed,Ephor. ap. Strab. x. p. 482Plut. Lycurg. 4 namely, that Lycurgus, arriving at Crete in the course of his travels, there met with Thaletas, who was one of the men renowned in the island for wisdom and political abilities and who, while professing to be a lyric poet, used his art as a pretext, but in fact devoted himself to political science in the same way as the ablest of legislators. Add to this the great probability that later writers mistook the sense of the word nomos in the ancient accounts of Thaletas; and his association with Lycurgus is explained. It is not worth while to discuss the statement of Jerome (Chron. s. a. 1266, b. c. 750), who says that Thales of Miletus (probably meaning Thales of Crete, for the philosopher's age is well known) lived in the reign of Romulus. The strictly historical evidence respecting the date of Thaletas is contained in three testimonies. First, the statement of Glaucus, one of the highest authorities on the subject, that he was later than Archilochus.(Plut. de Mus. 10, p. 1134, d. e.) Secondly, the fact recorded by Pausanias,(i. 14. ¬ß 4) that Polymnestus composed verses in his praise for the Lacedaemonians, whence it is probable that he was an elder contemporary of Polymnestus, and therefore older than Alcman, by whom Polymnestus was mentioned.(Plut. de Mus. 5, p. 1133, a.) Thirdly, in his account of the second school or system (katastasis) of music at Sparta, Plutarch(de Mus. 9, p. 1134, c.) tells us that the first system was established by Terpander; but of the second the following had the best claim to be considered as the leaders, Thaletas, Xenodamus, Xenocritus, Polymnestus, and Sacadas; and that to them was ascribed the origin of the Gymnopaedias in Lacedaemon, of the Apodeixeis in Arcadia, and of the Endymatia in Argos. This important testimony is very probably derived from the work of Glaucus. Lastly, Plutarch(de Mus. 10, p. 1134, e.) mentions a vague tradition, which is on the face of it improbable, and which is quite unworthy to be placed by the side of the other three, that Thaletas derived the rhythm called Maron and the Cretic rhythm from the music of the Phrygian flute-player Olympus the context shows that Plutarch here deserts his guide, Glaucus, and sets up against him the traditions of other writers, we know not whom). Now, from these testimonies we obtain the results, that Thaletas was younger than Archilochus and Terpander, but older than Polymnestus and Alcman, that he was the first of the poets of the second Spartan school of music, by whose influence the great Dorian festivals which have been mentioned were either established, or, what is the more probable meaning, were systematically arranged in respect of the choruses which were performed at them.These conditions would all be satisfied by supposing that Thaletas began to flourish early in the seventh century BC, provided that we accept the argument for an earlier date of Terpander than that usually assigned to Thaletas, is altogether inadmissible; for, if we reject Plutarch's account of the two musical schools at Sparta, the first founded by Terpander, and the second by Thaletas, the whole matter is thrown into hopeless confusion. Such a mistake, made by so eminent chronologer, through following implicitly Eusebius and the Parian Chronicle, is an excellent example of the danger of trusting to the positive statements of the chronographers in opposition to a connected chain of inference from more detailed testimonies. On the other hand, Miiller, while pointing out Clinton's error, appears to us to place Thaletas much too low, in consequence of accepting the tradition recorded by Plutarch respecting Olympus, whom also he places later than Terpander(Hist. Lit. vol. i. pp. 158, 159. The fact is that we have no sufficient data for the time of Olympus ; and even if we had, the tradition recorded by Plutarch is much too doubtful to be set up against the evidence derived from the relations of Thaletas to Archilochus and Alcman. When Muller says that Clinton \\" does not allow sufficient weight to the far more artificial character of the music and rhythms of Thaletas \\" (i. e. than those of Terpander), he seems to imply that a long time must necessarily have intervened between the two. Not only is there no ground for this idea, but it is opposed to analogy. There is no ground for it; for it is clear from all accounts that the second system of music was not gradually developed out of the first, by successive improvements, but was formed by the addition of new elements derived from other quarters, of which the first and chief were those introduced by Thaletas from Crete. It is also opposed to analogy, which teaches us that the period of most rapid improvement in any art is that in which it is first brought under the dominion of definite laws, by some great genius, whose first efforts are the signal for the appearance of a host of rivals, imitators, and pupils. Moreover, if there be any truth in the tradition, it would seem probable that Terpander and Thaletas were led to Sparta by very similar causes at no very distant period; and it seems most improbable that, after music had attained the degree of development to which Terpander brought it at Sparta, the important additional elements, which existed, in the Cretan system, should not have been introduced for a period of forty years, which is. the interval placed by Muller between Terpander and Thaletas. Muller's mode of computing backwards the date of Thaletas from that of Sacadas (b. c. 590) is altogether arbitrary ; but if such a method be allowable at all, surely thirty years is far too short a time to assign as the period during which the second school of Spartan music chiefly flourished. On the whole, decidedly as Clinton is wrong as to Terpander, he is probably near the mark in fixing the period of Thaletas at B. C. 690 ‚Ä¢‚Äî660 ; though it might be better to say that he seems to have flourished about B. C. 670 or 660, and how much before or after those dates cannot be determined. It appears not unlikely that he was already distinguished in Crete, while Terpander flourished at Sparta Legacy The improvement effected in music by Thaletas appears to have consisted in the introduction into Sparta of that species of music and poetry which was associated with the religious rites of his native country; in which the calm and solemn worship of Apollo prevailed side by side with the more animated songs and dances of the Curetes, which resembled the Phrygian worship of the Magna Mater.(Muller, p. 160) His chief compositions were paeans and hyporchemes, which belonged respectively to these two kinds of worship. In connection with the paean he introduced the rhythm of the Cretic foot, with its resolutions in the paeons; and the Pyrrhic dance, with its several variations of rhythm, is also ascribed to him. He seems to have used both the lyre and the flute.(See Muller, pp. 160, 161.) Plutarch and other writers speak of him as a lyric poet, and Suidas mentions, as his works, mele kai poiemata tina mythica, and it is pretty certain that the musical compositions of his age and school were often combined with suitable original poems, though sometimes, as we are expressly told of many of the names of Terpander, they were adapted to the verses of Homer. Be this as it may, we have now no remains of the poetry of Thaletas. Literature * Zaykov, Andrey. Thaletas from Creta in Sparta. (in Russian + English Summary.)

Major long distance trains that served the station included west coast sections of the Champion which originated in New York City, the City of Miami (originating from Chicago) the South Wind (originating from Chicago) and the Southland (originating from Chicago). Each of these (excepting the Southland) ran as a combined section from Jacksonville, Florida.Atlantic Coast Line Railroad 1961 timetable, pages 9, 10, 12 Seaboard Coast Line By 1968, the station's operations came under the banner of the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, formed by the merger of Atlantic Coast Line with rival company Seaboard Air Line Railroad. The two formerly independent passenger operations were consolidated at this location, resulting in the closure of St. Petersburg's Seaboard Air Line Station.Yogman, Ron (17 February 1972), \\"Cox Lumber Buys Seaboard Station\\", The Evening Independent (St. Petersburg). Amtrak The station's service under Seaboard Coast Line continued until 1971, when Amtrak assumed operation of most of the nation's passenger rail service. Assigned station code STP, the St. Petersburg Amtrak Station was serviced by trains such as the Floridian, Silver Star, and Silver Meteor. On February 1, 1984, passenger rail service to St. Petersburg came to an end following the discontinuation of all Amtrak rail services in Pinellas County.. CSX did not have enough funding to maintain the bridge across the bay. Operations continued from the St. Petersburg station for Amtrak's Thruway Motorcoach bus service, linking passengers to rail connections in Tampa and Orlando. The station served as a boarding location for the bus service until the 1990s, when the station was closed. Current status The current Amtrak bus station in a shopping center in Pinellas Park, Florida, in 2016. After its usage as a train station ended, the former St. Petersburg station was renovated for use by a pharmaceutical company. The trackside awning that covered the platform, along with the block lettering \\"Saint Petersburg\\" were removed and disposed of in an early 2008 effort to \\"commercialize\\" the property. All traces of the property's link to rail history were removed, save for a slight concrete rise on the South end of the tracks where the edge of the platform once stood, and the secondary platforms, which served as picnic and storage areas. As of 2016, the station building is unoccupied and for sale.

Cognitive musicology can be differentiated from other branches of music psychology via its methodological emphasis, using computer modeling to study music-related knowledge representation with roots in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories.Laske, O. (1999). AI and music: A cornerstone of cognitive musicology. In M. Balaban, K. Ebcioglu, & O. Laske (Eds.), Understanding music with AI: Perspectives on music cognition. Cambridge: The MIT Press. This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs. This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.Hamman, M., 1999. \\"Structure as Performance: Cognitive Musicology and the Objectification of Procedure,\\" in Otto Laske: Navigating New Musical Horizons, ed. J. Tabor. New York: Greenwood Press. Even while enjoying the simplest of melodies there are multiple brain processes that are synchronizing to comprehend what is going on. After the stimulus enters and undergoes the processes of the ear, it enters the auditory cortex, part of the temporal lobe, which begins processing the sound by assessing its pitch and volume. From here, brain functioning differs amongst the analysis of different aspects of music. For instance, the rhythm is processed and regulated by the left frontal cortex, the left parietal cortex and the right cerebellum standardly. Tonality, the building of musical structure around a central chord, is assessed by the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum (Abram, 2015). Music is able to access many different brain functions that play an integral role in other higher brain functions such as motor control, memory, language, reading and emotion. Research has shown that music can be used as an alternative method to access these functions that may be unavailable through non-musical stimulus due to a disorder. Musicology explores the use of music and how it can provide alternative transmission routes for information processing in the brain for diseases such as Parkinson's and dyslexia as well. Notable researchers The polymath Christopher Longuet-Higgins, who coined the term \\"cognitive science\\", is one of the pioneers of cognitive musicology. Among other things, he is noted for the computational implementation of an early key-finding algorithm.Longuet-Higgins, C. (1987) Mental Processes: Studies in cognitive science. Cambridge, MA, US: The MIT Press. Key finding is an essential element of tonal music, and the key-finding problem has attracted considerable attention in the psychology of music over the past several decades. Carol Krumhansl and Mark Schmuckler proposed an empirically grounded key-finding algorithm which bears their names. Their approach is based on key- profiles which were painstakingly determined by what has come to be known as the probe-tone technique. This algorithm has successfully been able to model the perception of musical key in short excerpts of music, as well as to track listeners' changing sense of key movement throughout an entire piece of music. David Temperley, whose early work within the field of cognitive musicology applied dynamic programming to aspects of music cognition, has suggested a number of refinements to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler Key-Finding Algorithm. Otto Laske was a champion of cognitive musicology. A collection of papers that he co-edited served to heighten the visibility of cognitive musicology and to strengthen its association with AI and music. The foreword of this book reprints a free-wheeling interview with Marvin Minsky, one of the founding fathers of AI, in which he discusses some of his early writings on music and the mind. AI researcher turned cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has also contributed a number of ideas pertaining to music from an AI perspective. Musician Steve Larson, who worked for a time in Hofstadter's lab, formulated a theory of \\"musical forces\\" derived by analogy with physical forces. Hofstadter also weighed in on David Cope's experiments in musical intelligence, which take the form of a computer program called EMI which produces music in the form of, say, Bach, or Chopin, or Cope. Cope's programs are written in Lisp, which turns out to be a popular language for research in cognitive musicology. Desain and Honing have exploited Lisp in their efforts to tap the potential of microworld methodology in cognitive musicology research. Also working in Lisp, Heinrich Taube has explored computer composition from a wide variety of perspectives. There are, of course, researchers who chose to use languages other than Lisp for their research into the computational modeling of musical processes. Tim Rowe, for example, explores \\"machine musicianship\\" through C++ programming. A rather different computational methodology for researching musical phenomena is the toolkit approach advocated by David Huron.Huron, D. (2002). Music Information Processing Using the Humdrum Toolkit: Concepts, Examples, and Lessons. \\"Computer Music Journal, 26\\" (2), 11‚Äì26. At a higher level of abstraction, Gerraint Wiggins has investigated general properties of music knowledge representations such as structural generality and expressive completeness. Although a great deal of cognitive musicology research features symbolic computation, notable contributions have been made from the biologically inspired computational paradigms. For example, Jamshed Bharucha and Peter Todd have modeled music perception in tonal music with neural networks.Bharucha, J. J., & Todd, P. M. (1989). Modeling the perception of tonal structure with neural nets. Computer Music Journal, 44‚àí53 Al Biles has applied genetic algorithms to the composition of jazz solos.Biles, J. A. 1994. \\"GenJam: A Genetic Algorithm for Generating Jazz Solos.\\" Proceedings of the 1994 International Computer Music Conference. San Francisco: International Computer Music Association Numerous researchers have explored algorithmic composition grounded in a wide range of mathematical formalisms. Within cognitive psychology, among the most prominent researchers is Diana Deutsch, who has engaged in a wide variety of work ranging from studies of absolute pitch and musical illusions to the formulation of musical knowledge representations to relationships between music and language. Equally important is Aniruddh D. Patel, whose work combines traditional methodologies of cognitive psychology with neuroscience. Patel is also the author of a comprehensive survey of cognitive science research on music. Perhaps the most significant contribution to viewing music from a linguistic perspective is the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM) proposed by Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff. Although GTTM is presented at the algorithmic level of abstraction rather than the implementational level, their ideas have found computational manifestations in a number of computational projects. For the German-speaking area, Laske's conception of cognitive musicology has been advanced by Uwe Seifert in his book Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft (\\"Systematic music theory and cognitive science. The foundation of cognitive musicology\\")Uwe Seifert: Systematische Musiktheorie und Kognitionswissenschaft. Zur Grundlegung der kognitiven Musikwissenschaft. Orpheus Verlag f√ºr systematische Musikwissenschaft, Bonn 1993 and subsequent publications.  Music and language acquisition skills  Both music and speech rely on sound processing and require interpretation of several sound features such as timbre, pitch, duration, and their interactions (Elzbieta, 2015). A fMRI study revealed that the Broca's and Wernicke's areas, two areas that are known to activated during speech and language processing, were found activated while the subject was listening to unexpected musical chords (Elzbieta, 2015). This relation between language and music may explain why, it has been found that exposure to music has produced an acceleration in the development of behaviors related to the acquisition of language. The Suzuki music education which is very widely known, emphasizes learning music by ear over reading musical notation and preferably begins with formal lessons between the ages of 3 and 5 years. One fundamental reasoning in favor of this education points to a parallelism between natural speech acquisition and purely auditory based musical training as opposed to musical training due to visual cues. There is evidence that children who take music classes have obtained skills to help them in language acquisition and learning (Oechslin, 2015), an ability that relies heavily on the dorsal pathway. Other studies show an overall enhancement of verbal intelligence in children taking music classes. Since both activities tap into several integrated brain functions and have shared brain pathways it is understandable why strength in music acquisition might also correlate with strength in language acquisition.  Music and pre-natal development  Extensive prenatal exposure to a melody has been shown to induce neural representations that last for several months. In a study done by Partanen in 2013, mothers in the learning group listened to the ‚ÄòTwinkle twinkle little star' melody 5 times per week during their last trimester. After birth and again at the age of 4 months, they played the infants in the control and learning group a modified melody in which some of the notes were changed. Both at birth and at the age of 4 months, infants in the learning group had stronger event related potentials to the unchanged notes than the control group. Since listening to music at a young age can already map out neural representations that are lasting, exposure to music could help strengthen brain plasticity in areas of the brain that are involved in language and speech processing.  Music therapy effect on cognitive disorders  If neural pathways can be stimulated with entertainment there is a higher chance that it will be more easily accessible. This illustrates why music is so powerful and can be used in such a myriad of different therapies. Music that is enjoyable to a person illicit an interesting response that we are all aware of. Listening to music is not perceived as a chore because it is enjoyable, however our brain is still learning and utilizing the same brain functions as it would when speaking or acquiring language. Music has the capability to be a very productive form of therapy mostly because it is stimulating, entertaining, and appears rewarding. Using fMRI, Menon and Levitin found for the first time that listening to music strongly modulates activity in a network of mesolimbic structures involved in reward processing. This included the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the hypothalamus, and insula, which are all thought to be involved in regulating autonomic and physiological responses to rewarding and emotional stimuli (Gold, 2013). Pitch perception was positively correlated with phonemic awareness and reading abilities in children (Flaugnacco, 2014). Likewise, the ability to tap to a rhythmic beat correlated with performance on reading and attention tests (Flaugnacco, 2014). These are only a fraction of the studies that have linked reading skills with rhythmic perception, which is shown in a meta-analysis of 25 cross-sectional studies that found a significant association between music training and reading skills (Butzlaff, 2000). Since the correlation is so extensive it is natural that researchers have tried to see if music could serve as an alternative pathway to strengthen reading abilities in people with developmental disorders such as dyslexia. Dyslexia is a disorder characterized by a long lasting difficulty in reading acquisition, specifically text decoding. Reading results have been shown to be slow and inaccurate, despite adequate intelligence and instruction. The difficulties have been shown to stem from a phonological core deficit that impacts reading comprehension, memory and prediction abilities (Flaugnacco, 2014). It was shown that music training modified reading and phonological abilities even when these skills are severely impaired. By improving temporal processing and rhythm abilities, through training, phonological awareness and reading skills in children with dyslexia were improved. The OPERA hypothesis proposed by Patel (2011), states that since music places higher demands on the process than speech it brings adaptive brain plasticity of the same neural network involved in language processing. Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological disorder that negatively impacts both motor and non-motor functions caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (Ashoori, 2015). This in turn leads to a DA deficiency in the basal ganglia. The deficiencies of dopamine in these areas of the brain have shown to cause symptoms such as tremors at rest, rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability. They are also associated with impairments of internal timing of an individual (Ashoori, 2015). Rhythm is a powerful sensory cue that has shown to help regulate motor timing and coordination when there is a deficient internal timing system in the brain. Some studies have shown that musically cued gait training significantly improves multiple deficits of Parkinson's, including in gait, motor timing, and perceptual timing. Ashoori's study consisted of 15 non-demented patients with idiopathic Parkinson's who had no prior musical training and maintained their dopamine therapy during the trials. There were three 30-min training sessions per week for 1 month where the participants walked to the beats of German folk music without explicit instructions to synchronize their footsteps to the beat. Compared to pre- training gait performance, the Parkinson's patients showed significant improvement in gait velocity and stride length during the training sessions. The gait improvement was sustained for 1 month after training, which indicates a lasting therapeutic effect. Even though this was uncued it shows how the gait of these Parkinson's patients was automatically synchronized with the rhythm of the music. The lasting therapeutic effect also shows that this might have affected the internal timing of the individual in a way that could not be accessed by other means.
