Opened in 1988, it features J. C. Penney, and Dick's Sporting Goods as its anchor stores. History The mall opened in 1988. Its original anchor stores were Troutman's Emporium, Gottschalks, Longs Drugs, and Sears. Longs Drugs was soon converted to a J. C. Penney store, which moved from North Valley Plaza. As a result, Longs moved its store to Paradise. Upon opening, the mall had over 95 stores and cost more than $4 million to build. Following the bankruptcy and closing of the Troutman's store, it was converted to Dick's Sporting Goods in 2012. Prior to this addition, original mall expansion plans instead called for demolishing the former Troutman's building, then home to a local furniture store, in favor of a new lifestyle center wing. After Gottschalks went out of business, its space became a Forever 21 store in 2009, which closed in 2020 as part of a plan to close 111 stores nationwide. Sears, the last remaining original anchor store, announced on June 6, 2017, that it would close the Chico Mall store in September 2017 as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide.

Charles Finkel (born September 25, 1943) is a designer, entrepreneur, artist and founder of Bon-Vin, Merchant du Vin, and The Pike Brewing Company in Seattle, Washington. Charles began marketing wines from small family owned California wineries in the 1970s and was the first to market the wines of Washington state throughout the country. In an article in Wines and Vines Magazine in 1970, Finkel was the first to use the term \\"boutique wines\\" to describe small, family owned wines of quality. He was the first importer to introduce Belgian beer along with craft beers from England, Scotland, Belgium, France, Norway, and Germany to America through Merchant du Vin. He designed the labels for beers including Ayinger Celebrator, Samuel Smith Celebrated Oatmeal Stout, Organic Chocolate Stout, Imperial Stout and Winter Welcome, Lindeman's Cuv√©e Ren√©, and Pike Brewing Company. In 2011, Draft Magazine named Charles as one of 10 Beer Innovators. He is married to Rose Ann Finkel, Vice President of Pike Brewing Company.  Early life  Charles was born in Flushing, Queens, New York in 1943 and moved with his family to Broken Arrow, Oklahoma in 1947. His father worked for American Airlines in Tulsa, Oklahoma. From 1962 thru 1966 he studied design and marketing at University of Oklahoma. He was first introduced to wineries in Livermore, California and the Napa valley in 1963. During his senior year at the University of Tulsa , he managed Mayo Meadows Liquor Store.  Wine industry  Charles and Rose Ann Finkel view a bottle of wine, circa 1972 In 1966 Finkel moved to New York to work for Monsieur Henri, a wine importer and wholesaler in NY and visited the wine growing regions in Spain, France, Germany and Portugal. Finkel met European wine merchants and vineyard owners who visited Monsieur Henri in NY. At age 25, he was named \\"salesmen of the year\\". In 1967 Monsieur Henri appointed him S.W. sales manager. Charles relocated to Houston, where he met his wife, Rose Ann (n√©e Martin). In 1969 he founded his own wine importing company, Bon-Vin, Inc, with offices in Tulsa and Houston. The Houston Chronicle in September 1971 called Charles and his business partner, Robert Conley, the \\"whiz kids of the wine world.\\" Bon-Vin imported to America the wines of Chalonaise including Chateau de Chamirey, Mercurey, Clos Solomon Givry, Le Vieux Chateau Montagny and Veuve Amba sparkling Rully. In Bordeaux, they represented Descas P√®re et Fils, and p√©tits ch√¢teaux including Caronne Ste. Gemmme-Haut Medoc, Caillon-Grand Cru Classe Barsac, Milon- Pauillac, Lescours, Laniote, La Serre and Le Chatelet- St. Emilion, Junayme- Fronsac, Millet- Graves, La Rame- St. Croix du Mont, and Bourseau-Lalalnde de Pomerol. Vineyards from other French regions included Huet-Vouvray, La Noe- Muscadet, Maucoil and St. Pierre- Chateauneuf du Pape, Jan Bourdy-Jura, Bodegas Matines Laquesta-Rioja, Delafoce‚ÄìPorto. In 1973 Bon- Vin acquired Robert Philips Wine Importing Company of Stamford, Connecticut adding the wines of George and Ludwig Schmidt-Rhine wines, Blondel-Marchal- Champagne, J. Vidal Fleury-Rhone and Henriques and Henriques-Madiera. In 1969 Bon-Vin became the exclusive agent for Ste. Michelle, now known as Ch√¢teau Ste. Michelle, in Washington state. During this time Charles convinced the winery to change the appellation from \\"American\\" to \\"Washington State\\" and added a back label to bottles that shows the latitude of Washington State in comparison to the European wine growing regions. In 1970 Bon-Vin and Finkel began representing emerging California wineries in Napa Valley, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties including Dry Creek, Z.D., Sutter Home, Ficklin, Kenwood, and Fetzer. In 1974 Bon-Vin was acquired by U.S. Tobacco as part of their purchase of American Wine Growers, which included Ste. Michelle. Charles and Rose Ann moved to Seattle, Washington where Finkel was Vice President of Marketing at Ch√¢teau Ste. Michelle, part of the team that built the ch√¢teau in Woodinville, Washington.  Craft beer  Importing  In 1978 Finkel founded Merchant du Vin, a wine and beer importing company, based in Seattle, Washington. He was the exclusive agent for states west of the Mississippi for D.G. Yuengling brewery of Pottsville, Pennsylvania. As the exclusive U.S. importer, Merchant du Vin acted as the sole United States agent for English breweries Samuel Smith Brewery and Melbourn Bros; German breweries Brauerei Ayinger and Pinkus M√ºller and Belgian breweries Orval, Lindemans and Rodenbach. According to Michael Jackson in Ultimate Beer, \\"Portland and Seattle are the top two craft-beer markets in the world. Perhaps because the beer-importer Merchant du Vin was located in Seattle, that city's restaurants were among the first in the nation to add specialty beers to their menus.\\" Pioneer brewer Bert Grant wrote in his autobiography, The Ale Master , \\"Give Charlie some credit for importing all those wild beers. He sort of primed the pump so that when the microbrewed beers showed up, people were prepared to taste something different.\\" Market Watch Magazine called Merchant du Vin \\"America's most impressive specialty beer importers.\\" The book Brewing in Seattle notes, \\"An entire book could be dedicated to the influence Charles Finkel and his wife, Rose Ann, had over not just Seattle's brewing culture but the entire American craft brewing industry. Before establishing Pike Place Brewery in 1989, the two had already created America's first boutique wine importing business and later a beer importing company that first introduced America to many of the most popular beer styles in craft brewing today.\\"  Pike Brewing Company  Charles and Rose Ann founded Pike Place Brewery (now known as Pike Brewing Company) in 1989, tapping the first keg on October 17, 1989. The brewery originally shared space with Liberty Malt Supply Co. at 1432 Western in the LaSalle Hotel building in Pike Place Market. Liberty Malt Supply Co., purchased from John Farias, was a home brewing and wine making shop and mail order retailer established in 1921. The tile, copper and stainless steel brewery had a four barrel copper kettle hand-crafted by Seattle's Alaska Copper and Brass and Jason Parker was the Head Brewer. Original beers brewed included Pike Place Ale and Pike XXXXX Extra Stout. Pike Place Brewery and Liberty Malt Supply moved to 1415 First Avenue, Seattle, WA in 1996, a three-story gravity-flow 30 barrel steam brew house adding The Pike Pub and Microbrewery Museum. The brewery's name was also changed to Pike Brewing Company. Pike Brewing Company, The Pike Pub and Liberty Malt Supply, as a part of Merchant du Vin, were sold in 1997. The pub and brewery continued but Liberty Malt Supply was closed. Charles and Rose Ann Finkel reacquired Pike Brewing Company, including The Pike Pub and brewery, on May 1, 2006.  Personal life  Charles met Rose Ann Martin at a wine tasting in Houston, Texas in 1968, they were married in 1969. They have two adult children, Andrew Finkel of Seattle, WA and Amy Finkel of Brooklyn, NY. Together they were the Seattle Slow Food Convivium Leaders from 1999 to 2004 and served on the national board of The Weizmann Institute of Science during the same period.

Biography Haim Yellin was born in the town of Vilkija to a Jewish family. His parents, Eliezer Yellin and Esther Rivel, spoke Hebrew, which was the language of instruction for Jews in the town at the time. During the First World War, the Jews of Lithuania were expelled by order of the Chief of Staff of the Russian Army in 1915, and his family was pushed to Voronezh. There they witnessed the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. As a result, his father changed his views considerably and Yiddish became spoken more in their home. The family returned from Russia to Lithuania in 1921 and settled in Kovno. Upon their return, his father founded a Jewish-general library in the city, which operated alongside the Culture League ( Kultur Lige). Chaim Yellin was educated and grew up reading a lot, which led to him being known as \\"The Book\\" by his friends. During his school career, he had to adjust. In Voronezh he began his studies in Russian. In Kovno, he moved to Yiddish, but because he was not in the fourth grade, he entered the Hebrew Gymnasium where he studied Hebrew until 1932. In addition, his studies at the University of Kovno in the Faculty of Economics was entirely in Lithuanian. Yellin began publishing theater reviews about performances of Jewish groups in Kovno. He moved from writing on these subjects gradually to reports and descriptions of street life and the market, town and village, and especially the difficult condition of the workers. He was one of the most active members of the left-wing young writers group, and was active in organizing literary and cultural evenings in the fields of literature, theater, music and poetry. World War II On June 24, 1941, a year after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Nazi Germany occupied Kovno. Yellin and his family tried to escape into the Soviet Union, but were captured by the Germans. They wandered for a while on the roads and forests and eventually came back to Kovno and were sent to the ghetto. While there, Yellin hid under the pseudonym \\"Kadishon\\" and disguised his appearance for fear of being captured by the Germans. By October, the Germans had carried out a number of massacres and deportation, and less than half of the Jewish community of Kovno was left, which previously numbered over 40,000. Three underground resistance groups were known to have been active in the ghetto by the fall of 1941. Yellin was the commander of one of them, which dealt mainly with collecting information on the fronts, providing relief to veterans of the movement, and caring for the children of missing fighters. In December 1941, the various groups merged into the \\"Anti-Fascist Struggle Organization.\\" Although he had a lack of experience, Yellin was appointed commander of the organization. At the time of its establishment, the organization's goals were defined: \\"We shall not abandon the ghetto. Our major aim is the open struggle against the Nazis within partisan ranks.\\" Members of the organization carried out many acts of sabotage, especially at work sites where Jews were sent to forced labor. In 1943, after many efforts to establish ties, the members of the Anti-Fascist Organization joined the Lithuanian Underground \\"Union for the War against Fascism in Lithuania,\\" and it was decided to cooperate closely. There were two attempts to establish a partisan base in the forests around Kovno, but these both failed. In September 1943 Yellin went to Vilna, following a letter he had received in the ghetto, in order to contact the parachutist, Gesia Glazer. In the meeting, Yellin received an invitation to one of the partisan bases in eastern Lithuania, and the two went to the forests of Rudniki. At the base, Yellin spent two weeks in which he underwent rapid training. Death On April 6, 1944, Yellin was on a mission with a Lithuanian who was an undercover German agent. When the agent tried to stop Yellin, he figured out what was going on, pulled out a revolver and shot the agent. After hearing the commotion, German and Lithuanian soldiers ran after Yellin, and he eventually reached his friends house after jumping fences and running through alleys. After being spotted by the officers as he made it into the house, he shot at both of them again and ran in a different direction. Knowing he couldn't have gone far, Germans called in reinforcements. Since Yellin was out of ammunition, he tried to commit suicide before he could be captured. The Gestapo found him barely alive, and arrested him. Chaim Yellin was eventually executed after weeks of torture and refusing to give the Germans any information. Family His brother, Meir Yellin (1910‚Äì2000) was a writer and engineer by profession. During the Nazi occupation he was imprisoned in the Kovno Ghetto, but eventually escaped and hid until the city was liberated by the Soviets. Upon the liberation of Kovno, he became the founder of a shelter for Jewish children who survived the Holocaust. He published stories and articles in Lithuania, and later in the Soviet Jewish press about the Holocaust in Lithuania. Among his works: \\"Partisaner von Kunaser Gette\\" (in Yiddish: \\"Partisans in the Kovno Ghetto\\", Moscow, 1948); \\"One Night\\" (in Lithuanian and Russian, 1966); \\"In the Death Fortresses\\" (in Lithuanian, 1966). With his wife, Dweira Yellin-Kormanaite, Meir Yellin had a daughter, Esther Yellin, born in 1940. Esther was a piano student in the legendary master class of Heinrich Neuhaus in Moscow. Today Esther Yellin works as a pianist and piano teacher for professional pianists in Zurich, Switzerland.

MIA Hunters organized at least 34 missions to China, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and elsewhere to locate the remains at crash sites and unmarked graves, without any charge to the families. They located a number of aircraft associated with milestones in military history, among them the Doolittle Raid and Operation Tidal Wave. Foundation and operation MIA Hunters was founded by Christopher Moon and his father Bryan Moon as a volunteer nonprofit organization that sought to find and facilitate the recovery of the remains of missing American World War II pilots and air crew members. Chris Moon was born in England as was his father Bryan, who was a former member of the Royal Air Force and a retired Northwest Airlines executive. Virtually all of their missions overseas and the work they performed was self-funded. For two decades, MIA Hunters organized missions to places such as China, Papua New Guinea, and Romania, where they discovered the remains of several hundred airmen and soldiers. They would travel to the country where the soldier's aircraft was last located, hire scouts to find elders who might recall the crash location and then search the surrounding area. MIA Hunters would photograph the site, mark coordinates, record aircraft ID and forward all of it to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, more precisely to the POW Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii. The documentation of each crash site ended with a prayer written by Chris Moon for the fallen crew members, as well as for the hunters' own safe return. Doolittle expeditions The Doolittle Raid is famous as the first American air raid to strike the Japanese archipelago in the Second World War. After bombing Tokyo, fourteen B-25 Mitchell bombers crashed in China on April 18, 1942. In 1988, Bryan Moon and Doolittle's navigator, Hank Potter, went to China to see what they could find in the mountains south of Nanking. It led to the discovery of Dr. Shen Yen-chan, a local medical practitioner to whom the injured crew of No. 7 aircraft were brought to for medical attention in 1942. This motivated them to mount another expedition. After twelve months of research, the Doolittle Raiders China Expedition arrived in Hangzhou in 1990. The 19-strong expedition included divers, pilots, and photographers. Villagers took them to the site where a B-25 had crashed. They obtained a parachute harness release from the body of one the Doolittle Raiders. Some of the aluminum from the Doolittle aircraft was pounded into plates and other objects by the Chinese and recovered by the MIA Hunters. On March 18, 1992, the members of China Zhejiang Delegation - five old men and women - were brought by Chris and Bryan Moon to the Wilson Center in Washington DC to meet eight members of the original Doolittle crew, the very same people they rescued in the Second World War. Here each Chinese villager was presented with medals made by the Moons commemorating their bravery. They were then invited to the White House to meet the President and toured the Pentagon, where President George H. W. Bush spoke at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Doolittle Raid. The MIA Hunters Doolittle mission in 1994 lasted three weeks, most of which was spent out at sea searching for bombers using side-scan sonar and magnetometers. During the expeditions to China between 1990 and 1994, MIA Hunters collected artifacts from four bombers. Immediately after preparing a Veterans Day exhibit of artifacts from the Doolittle raid, which was displayed to the public in Palm Aire, Florida, Bryan Moon died in 2015, aged 87, and MIA Hunters ceased its active operation. Other missions In the 1980s, Moon traveled to Romania and obtained new information about the pilots who participated in Operation Tidal Wave, an air attack of American bombers on oil refineries around the town of Ploie»ôti in 1943. The Moons and a team from MIA Hunters traveled to Papua New Guinea in 2006 to find and identify an American World War II bomber and its crew missing since 1943. They examined the crash site and collected small sections of the bomber and took photographs. They found the plane's construction number and serial number. MIA Hunters went on several other expeditions to Papua New Guinea over the years in search of lost American pilots. These were the final years in which native eyewitnesses to the battles and crashes were still alive to be interviewed. In the period from 2006 and 2010, native scouts engaged by MIA Hunters found and documented 92 more crash sites for MIA Hunters, with 375 wrecks believed to be still undiscovered in the jungle. Positive identifications of several remains were made, with the final burials done at Arlington Cemetery.

It is one of sixteen vertical lift bridges located along the western portion of the Erie Canal between Fairport and Lockport. The 139 ft (42 m) bridge is of unique design, being a decagonal style structure with no two angles the same throughout and no square corners on the bridge floor. It also crosses the canal at a 32-degree angle with the southern side being on the higher end. Powered by 40-horsepower electric motors, the bridge has a vertical lift of 10.6 ft (3.2 m). The structure is entirely raised straight up on four corner posts despite the bridge floor having a 4% grade. Over an average water level on the Erie Canal, approximate clearances below the bridge are 6 ft (2 m) when lowered and 16 ft (5 m) when raised. The control building is located on the southeast side of the bridge. Due to increased traffic usage and need of significant repairs, the Fairport Lift Bridge was threatened to be replaced in the 1970s with a new concrete bridge spanning both the railroad tracks and canal. A decision was eventually made to replace the bridge at nearby Turk Hill Road instead to ease congestion and keep the historic lift bridge in place on Main Street.

It is located on the Skaggerak coast in Southern Norway along the Groosefjorden, between the towns of Arendal (to the northeast) and Kristiansand (to the southwest). The town has a population (2016) of 12,552 which gives the town a population density of . Grimstad Church is located on a small hill overlooking the town's harbour. The University of Agder is located in the town as well. History Map of the boundaries of the town of Grimstad over the years. The village of Gr√∏mstad existed for a long time as part of the ancient prestegjeld of Fj√¶re. It is reportedly first mentioned as a harbor in the 16th century. Eight years after he was deposed, Christian II of Denmark‚ÄìNorway (1513‚Äì1523) attempted to recover his kingdoms. A tempest scattered his fleet off the Norwegian coast, and on 24 October 1531, they took refuge at Grimstad. On 1 July 1532, he surrendered to his rival, King Frederick I of Denmark, in exchange for a promise of safe conduct. King Frederick failed to honor his promise and imprisoned Christian until he died. An inn is recorded at Grimstad as early as 1607. In 1622, the village was granted ladested status under nearby Arendal due to its growing harbour and trading which gave it certain trading rights. By 1747, Grimstad was identified as a sailing community and a recognized haunt of smugglers. During the Napoleonic Wars, England blockaded Norway. In 1811, an English brig entered the harbor to capture blockade runners, but was vigorously repulsed and did not return. John Frederik Classen, who owned the Frolands V√¶rk (an ironworks), obtained concessions to export and import through Grimstad and bypass Arendal with its customs dues. Grimstad was awarded market town status in 1816. The town of Grimstad was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1878, part of the neighboring municipality of Fj√¶re (population: 948) was transferred to Grimstad. Again, on 1 January 1960, another part of Fj√¶re (pop: 344) was transferred to the town of Grimstad. On 1 January 1971, the rural municipalities of Fj√¶re (pop: 6,189) and Landvik (pop: 2,781) were merged with the town of Grimstad (pop: 2,794) to form a significantly larger municipality of Grimstad with a total population of 11,764 at the time of the merger. Name The town's name was originally Gr√∏mstad, when Norway belonged to the Danish kingdom. The name was misunderstood and became Grimstad during the registration of Norwegian cities and small places. The site of the town was originally the port (Old Norse: sto√∞) of the old Gr√∏m farm. The exact meaning of the name Gr√∏m is uncertain, but it is derived from a river name Gr√≥ or Gr√≥a which means \\"the growing one\\". Media gallery Grimstad 41.JPGView of the harbour.

Pursuit of Justice is a three-part video game series based around a criminal lawyer who is trying to convict guilty people. The three individual cases were sold separately or also as a three-case 8-CD bundle published by Alpha Software, shipped on September 15, 1997. The game is part of Legacy Software's RealPlay Series. Gameplay The player is a prosecuting attorney to needs to successfully present their case in court to win the trial and put the criminal behind bars. The gameplay consists of two sections: pre-trial and trial. The pre-trial phase sees the player collect evidence over four days - this can include police reports, witness interrogations, line-ups, jail snitch testimony, and physical evidence. The player puts their evidence into the Case Constructor, where they need to prove each element of the case. The trial phase sees the player put their witnesses on the stand, object to the defending lawyer's unacceptable questions, and citing criminal codes when the defending lawyer tries to poke holes in the argument. The game encourages players to cultivate their problem solving, strategy, and analysis skills. Development Design and release According to Talk Visual Corporation, the company was formed by the merger of Legacy Software with Videocall,https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tvce/SecArticle?countryCode=US&guid;=829579&type;=313 Prior to the game's release, Gregg Ackerman of the AckermanBenson advertising production company joined Legacy Software, and he would become the title's executive producer. Of D.A. Pursuit of Justice he said: \\"We didn't intend this to be a graduate course in law\\" but that he wanted players to learn that \\"it's not easy being a lawyer.\\" The Windows 95 CD-ROM game included interactive screens, full-motion video, and 16-bit color. The game had 500 pages (equivalent to two feature films), fifty-seven principal actors, 20 sets, six screenwriters, and took a year to complete. It was filmed on the streets of Los Angeles over a period of three weeks. The game saw the first use of the \\"Microsoft Designed for Windows 95\\" Logo. The game uses Microsoft DirectX 3 technology. A school edition was also made available. The three cases were collectively Alpha Interactive's second game in their \\"RealPlay\\" series, after the medical simulator title EmergencyRoom. This series aimed to \\"intertwine high intensity gameplay with simulated career experience\\". The developers teamed up with crime-themed television network Court TV (currently known as TruTV) to create the spin-off game Legal Pursuit, to build consumer awareness. The game was featured on Court TV's website, and was later included in the bundle version of the game. It was also available on the Legacy Software website. D.A. Pursuit of Justice: The Rat Tattoo Murder was offered as a prize for an Arizona Republic-run competition. Legacy employee Lisa Stein presented and previewed the game at the 1997 E3 gaming expo.June 19, 1997 In collaboration with public interest law firm Public Counsel as part of their School-Linked Legal Assistance Program, The Sunset Boulevard Deuce was used as an education tool in North Hollywood and Los Angeles high schools to teach them about drink-driving. The program was led by Public Counsel attorney Andrea Ramos, and Legacy Software president Ariella Lehrer (who is also a cognitive psychologist). The game is unique for offering California attorneys MCLE credit, being equivalent to 18 units of continuing education credit at the State Bar of California. Of the 2001 re-release, Legacy Interactive CEO Ariella Lehrer said \\"Our customers like fast-paced excitement and thrills, but also real-life scenarios and problem-solving situations that challenge the mind more than the trigger finger\\". In October 1996, Alpha Interactive anticipated the game would be released in the first quarter of 1997. The fourth quarter of 1996 saw Legacy Software and IBM mutually decide to terminate the D.A. Pursuit of Justice \\"DA License Agreement\\"; Legacy paid IBM $400,000 to obtain their rights, which would be effective January 3, 1997. In March, Alpha Interactive signed a contract with EduCorp, on the basis that their market research told them that the title would achieve synergy with the customer base and distribution reach of EduCorp. On March 17, 1997, it was announced that Legacy had terminated an agreement with IBM for co-publishing the title. An exclusive distribution contract was signed with Alpha Software Corporation on August 7, 1997. Commercial performance D.A. Pursuit of Justice was commercially unsuccessful. The game absorbed $859,424 in company resources during 1998 alone. Legacy began its exit from the game industry in June 1997, and continued to do so through 1998. In August 1997, it was announced the title and Emergency Room Intern would be distributed through their network of 5,000 US retailers in September of that year. In early September it was announced the game would be published on the 15th of that month. By December 15, 1997 the Company was unable to make the payment to IBM so a compromise involving royalties to other titles was reached. In 1998, BTI and Legacy signed a contract which stipulated they would \\"pursue joint venture programs\\" for the development and distribution of four titles, including this game. Financed through BTI, Legacy planned to complete released the three remaining cases of the project, with the potential for it to become as evergreen title, with new cases constantly being released in subsequent years. In May of that year, Legacy announced it had terminated its merger negotiation, and that Legacy would instead agree to acquire BTI, and that the two companies were still looking to raise money to further develop this game. But these plans were ultimately abandoned, and the remaining three cases have not been released. On March 26, 1998, Legacy Interactive announced the formation of two Limited Liability Companies, for the purpose of developing and marketing new titles in their RealPlay series: Emergency Room Deluxe and D.A. Pursuit of Justice. On May 19, it was announced the company received two private placements from DK Trust and Black Tusk Interactive. In the three months ended September 30, 1998, D.A. Pursuit of Justice experienced a decrease in sales. A charge of $600,000 was provided to the developers for product development costs, based on the reduced forecasted sales of the CD-ROM version of the title. The company was also in talks with third parties about developing and marketing a DVD version of the game. 1998 report indicated that the title had generated revenue that was lower than expected, and led to the company generated losses, leading Legacy to terminate its distribution agreement with Alpha Soft effective December 31, 1998. Distributed by Activision, a version of the game was available in retail stores throughout the US and Canada on October 1, 2001. –ó–ê–û \\"–ù–æ–≤—ã–π –î–∏—Å–∫\\" has the exclusive rights to localize, publish and distribute the game in Russia, CIS and Baltic countries, and is yet to act on those rights.

The Adrenaline Vault noted that the subject matter was ripe for a video game, due to the recent TV landscape that included: L.A. Law, Law and Order, The Practice, People's Court, and Judge Judy. Games Domain gave mixed reviews to all three titles, making a special mention of the limited time the player has to collect evidence. PC Mag recommended both the game and Emergency: Code Red to players who wanted realistic simulations of those industries. Julie Strasberg of Game Power, HomePC and Gameboomers called the game both compelling and entertaining. AllAboutGames noted that the player's score is never revealed to the player until the end of their game, maintaining an element of surprise. PC World felt that while the game was realistic, it was not afast-moving and conldued by saying \\"caveat emptor\\".

She is a former principal White House Deputy Chief of Staff to President Donald Trump and was chief of staff to John F. Kelly during his tenure as Secretary of Homeland Security. Nielsen was confirmed as secretary of homeland security on December 5, 2017. Following her appointment, Nielsen implemented the controversial Trump administration family separation policy. She resigned in April 2019. Early life and education Kirstjen Michele Nielsen was born on May 14, 1972, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Phyllis Michele Nielsen and James McHenry Nielsen, both United States Army physicians. Nielsen's father is of Danish ancestry while her mother is of German descent. The oldest of three children, Nielsen has a sister, Ashley, and a brother, Fletcher. Following Nielsen's birth, the family relocated from Colorado Springs to Clearwater, Florida. Following high school, Nielsen attended the Georgetown School of Foreign Service, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree. She then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, receiving her Juris Doctor in 1999. She also took Japanese studies at Nanzan University, in Nagoya, Japan. Early career Nielsen served during the George W. Bush administration as special assistant to the president and as senior director for prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) at the White House Homeland Security Council. She also set up, and led as assistant administrator, the Transportation Security Administration's Office of Legislative Policy and Government Affairs. After leaving the Bush administration in 2008, Nielsen became the founder and president of Sunesis Consulting. The firm's online profile listed her as its only employee, with the firm's phone number being Nielsen's personal cellphone. In September 2013 the company won a federal contract, with an initial award of about $450,000, to \\"provide policy and legislation, technical writing, and organizational development\\" to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Nielsen was a senior member of the Resilience Task Force of the Center for Cyber & Homeland Security Committee at George Washington University and served on the Global Risks Report Advisory Board of the World Economic Forum. Initial positions in the Trump administration Nielsen served as John F. Kelly's chief of staff at the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after he assumed that position on January 20, 2017. In early September 2017, just over a month after Kelly became White House chief of staff on July 31, 2017, Nielsen moved to the White House, becoming the principal deputy chief of staff under Kelly. Secretary of Homeland Security  Nomination  Kirstjen Nielsen taking the oath of office as the sixth U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security On October 11, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Nielsen to be the new United States secretary of homeland security, replacing Acting Secretary Elaine Duke. On December 5, 2017, the Senate confirmed her nomination, by a 62‚Äì37 vote. On December 6, 2017, she was sworn in as secretary of homeland security. Tenure On January 16, 2018, Nielsen testified before the United States Senate in favor of merit, rather than family, based immigration. She was questioned about an earlier meeting at the White House in which press reports and Senator Dick Durbin related that the president had used the word \\"shithole\\" to describe African countries, as well as disparaging remarks about Haiti. Nielsen said, \\"I did not hear that word used, no sir,\\" although she said she heard \\"tough language\\" that was impassioned. During the same hearing, Senator Patrick Leahy asked her whether Norway was a predominantly white country. Nielsen appeared to hesitate before answering with, \\"I actually do not know that, sir.\\" She added, \\"But I imagine that is the case.\\" Nielsen was criticized by Senator Cory Booker for not recalling or speaking out against Trump's disparaging remarks which Booker characterized as bigoted.Ella Nielson, January 16, 2018, VOX, ‚ÄúYour silence and your amnesia is complicity‚Äù: Sen. Cory Booker blasts a top White House official for disputing Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúshithole‚Äù comments. . Retrieved January 16, 2018, \\"....\\"It is deeply troubling that in your opening comments, when you talk about the threats to our nation, our homeland, to national security, that you failed to mention a report that outlined a very specific threat to us...\\"Josh Delk, January 16, 2018, The Hill, Booker to Nielsen: 'Your silence and your amnesia is complicity' . Retrieved January 16, 2018 Following the hearing, Nielsen expressed her disappointment in the amount of attention being paid to the White House meeting. From March to December 2018, Nielsen sat on the Federal Commission on School Safety. On March 23, 2018, it was reported that Nielsen agreed with the enactment of the Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security Regarding Military Service by Transgender Individuals. Nielsen at a press conference during Super Bowl LII, February 2018 At a May 2018 congressional hearing, Nielsen said that she was unaware of the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 presidential election to help candidate Trump get elected. An assessment by the FBI, CIA and NSA in January 2017 was that the Russian preference was clearly to help Trump win; this assessment was mirrored in a bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee released days prior to Nielsen's testimony. Nielsen said that she had not seen the intelligence community briefing that Russia had tried to interfere in the 2016 election. Nielsen later, in May 2018 backtracked, saying that she agreed with the intelligence community's assessment. In July 2018, Nielsen said there were no signs that Russia was targeting the 2018 midterm elections in the same \\"scale or scope\\" as it did in 2016. At the Aspen Security Forum, Aspen, Colorado, during an interview by Peter Alexander of NBC on July 19, 2018, Nielsen stated that Russians had absolutely interfered in the United States presidential election in 2016. When Alexander asked if Russians had interfered in favor of Donald Trump, Nielsen responded, \\"I have not seen any evidence that the attempts to interfere in our election infrastructure was to favor a particular political party. I think what we have seen on the foreign influence side is they were attempting to intervene and cause chaos on both sides.\\" Prior to this on July 16, 2018, at the joint press conference in Helsinki after 2018 Russia‚ÄìUnited States Summit, Jeff Mason from Reuters asked President Putin, \\"Did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?\\" Putin's response was: \\"Yes, I wanted him to win. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.‚ÄìRussia relationship back to normal.\\" During the same interview at the Aspen Security Forum when Alexander further asked whether the president has made countering white supremacy a priority, Nielsen replied that he wanted the DHS to prevent \\"any form of violence\\" threatening Americans. Referring to President Trump's response to clashes between the white supremacists and counter-protesters at Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, 2017, Alexander asked, \\"But in the comments that are obviously highly publicized when he [President Trump] placed blame in his words on both side, does that make your job harder when [p]resident says things that at least in those communities are viewed as he has got our [white supremacists'] back?\\" She said, \\"I think what is interesting about that is we saw, and I think we continue to learn‚Äî maybe there was different, whether it was foreign influence or different purposeful attempts to get both sides, if you will, aggressively pitted against each other.\\" She later added that \\"it is not that one side is right, one side is wrong. Anybody that is advocating violence, we need to work to mitigate.\\" U.S. Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Commerce and Federal Bureau of Investigation announces 23 criminal charges against PRC's Huawei and Wanzhou Meng In October 2018, Nielsen said that China has become a major threat to the U.S. Nielsen also confirmed, in an answer to a question from a senator, that China is trying to influence U.S. elections. On October 22, 15 days prior to the 2018 mid-term elections, President Trump met with Nielsen and White House staff and demanded \\"extreme action\\" to stop migrants at the southern border. Later that afternoon at a meeting of top Homeland Security officials, Customs and Border Protections representatives proposed deploying a microwave weapon against approaching migrants. Nielsen told an aide at the meeting that she would not authorize the use of the device and that its use should never be brought up to her again. In January 2019, Nielsen, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and FBI director Christopher Wray announced 23 criminal charges (including financial fraud, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States, theft of trade secret technology, provided bonus to workers who stole confidential information from companies around the world, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and sanctions violations) against Chinese tech giant Huawei and its CFO Meng Wanzhou. =Family separation policy= On May 7, 2018, Secretary Nielsen, despite her objection, officially enacted a controversial practice of the Trump administration's policy of separating parents and children accused of crossing over the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border illegally. Pompeo, Secretary Mnuchin and Advisor Kushner with Mexican president-elect L√≥pez Obrador, July 13, 2018 At a congressional hearing on May 15, 2018, Nielsen testified that she would enforce the then-newly enacted Trump administration policy of separating parents and children who crossed over the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, noting that similar separations happened in criminal courts \\"every day.\\" In June 2018, Nielsen stated that the Trump administration did not maintain a policy of separating migrant families at the Southern border; The Washington Post fact-checker described Nielsen's claim as false and \\"Orwellian.\\" At that point, the Trump administration had in six weeks separated approximately 2,000 migrant children from their parents. Contrary to Nielsen's claims, the DHS website showed that a policy of family separation was in place. On June 18, 2018, Nielsen defended the policy at a sheriffs' conference but said the administration had asked Congress \\"to allow us to keep families together while they are detained\\" as an alternative. \\"We cannot detain children with their parents so we must either release both the parents and the children ‚Äì this is the historic 'get out of jail free' practice of the previous administration ‚Äì or the adult and the minor will be separated as the result of prosecuting the adult. Those are the only two options. Surely it is the beginning of the unraveling of democracy when the body who makes the laws, rather than changing them, asks the body who enforces the laws not to enforce the laws. That cannot be the answer.\\"BBC Newshour, June 18, 2018 Three days earlier, the DHS said that it had separated 1,995 immigrant children from 1,940 adults, which it described as \\"alleged adult parents,\\" at the border between mid-April and the end of May. Because the law forbids children from being kept in criminal detention facilities, they are separated from their parents. Nielsen held a press briefing with White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders in June 2018 amid growing public outcry about the family separation policy. Nielsen accused the media and members of Congress of mischaracterizing the administration's policy. She dismissed the suggestion that the administration was using family separations as political leverage to force Congress to support Trump's broader immigration agenda or to deter migrants from coming to the United States. In doing so, she contradicted comments made earlier by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Chief of Staff John Kelly and senior adviser Stephen Miller. She got very little support from administration officials such as Miller, who was openly against her. John Kelly, who had strongly recommended her to Trump, was her biggest advocate amongst the people who talk to Trump the most. Nielsen with Mexican president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, October 4, 2018 On June 20, 2018, after repeatedly arguing that the administration could not sign an executive order to end family separations, she was present at Trump's signing of an executive order ending his \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy of separating of children from families. Sources told Politico that Nielsen had privately pushed for this executive order behind the scenes while at the same time saying publicly that the executive order could not be created. In September 2018, The Intercept reported that Nielsen had previously personally authorized the family separation policy after receiving an April 23, 2018, memo by the heads of three federal immigration agencies (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement) recommending the family separation policy for the express purpose of deterring migration. At the time of the report, Nielsen had avoided attributing deterrence as the purpose of the policy. In 2019, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) wrote in a letter to FBI director Christopher A. Wray: ‚Äú...the FBI should immediately investigate whether Secretary Nielsen‚Äôs statements [to Congress] violate 18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1621, 18 U.S.C ¬ß 1001, or any other relevant federal statutes that prohibit perjury and false statements to Congress.‚Äù Other Democratic representatives also echoed the same accusations. Nielsen has repeatedly denied the allegations of perjury. Kirstjen Nielsen with UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, May 2018 In October 2019, Nielsen defended the family separation policy, saying \\"I don‚Äôt regret enforcing the law.\\" = Border incidents = During Nielsen's tenure, several incidents at the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border between law enforcement and migrants seeking passage attracted international attention and prompted criticism of the Trump administration's approach towards enforcement.  Border agents' use of tear gas  On Sunday, November 25, 2018, there was an incident at the San Ysidro Port of Entry between California and Mexico. Groups of Central American migrant caravans tried to forcibly cross the border into the United States. Some of them threw rocks at U.S. Border Patrol agents, who responded by firing tear gas into the crowd which included families with small children. The use of tear gas in this situation was strongly criticized. In a statement Nielsen said that this caravan had acted violently in the past and \\"I refuse to believe that anyone honestly maintains that attacking law enforcement with rocks and projectiles is acceptable.\\" She added that in some cases the women and children in the caravan were being used by the organizers as \\"human shields\\" when they confronted law enforcement. She asserted \\"at this point we have confirmed that there are over 600 convicted criminals traveling with the caravan flow.\\" An earlier \\"Fact Sheet\\" about the caravan, released by the DHS, had stated that \\"over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories\\" and that \\"Mexican officials have also publicly stated that criminal groups have infiltrated the caravan.\\" It also asserted that the caravan included individuals from more than 20 countries. However, that statement was challenged by a Washington Post fact checker, who said it was oddly worded in such a way as to suggest the people referenced were not actually part of the caravan.  Deaths of migrant children in CBP custody  In another instance, Jakelin Caal, a 7-year-old girl from Guatemala, died in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, on December 8, 2018. A few weeks later on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2018, Felipe G√≥mez Alonso, an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala, died in the custody of CBP. In a formal statement released on December 26, 2018, Nielsen called the death \\"deeply concerning and heartbreaking\\" and cited U.S. immigration system failings for a growing border crisis. She said she had ordered her agency to bolster medical screenings of children at the southwest border and had enlisted the medical corps of the United States Coast Guard to provide an assessment of CBP's medical programs. The secretary also said that she would travel to the border to personally observe the screenings. Nielsen said that the changing immigration dynamic had been spurred by \\"an immigration system that rewards parents for sending their children across the border alone,\\" without requiring the adults to face \\"consequences for their actions.\\" In the same statement released on December 26, 2018, Nielsen added, \\"Smugglers, traffickers, and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north. [...] As a result of bad judicial rulings from activist judges and inaction by Congress, we are seeing a flood of family units and unaccompanied alien children.\\" = Asylum request from Anastasia Vashukevich = After her arrest in Pattaya, Thailand, on February 25, 2018, Anastasia Vashukevich immediately requested asylum in the United States because she feared for her life if Russia became involved. She stated that she had been \\"repressed by Russia\\" and had fled Russia for Thailand. Vashukevich had videos and audio recordings of \\"crymes of Russian government\\" and wished to give these recordings both video and audio to United States authorities. A hand written note signed by Vashukevich requesting asylum in the United States was given to a Ukrainian American, Pavlo Yunko, who delivered it to the United States embassy in Bangkok. A spokesperson for the embassy, Jillian Bonnardeaux, stated that the matter was referred to the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because all matters regarding asylum in the United States are handled by DHS, however, no one contacted Vashukevich from DHS. On February 28, 2018, the Radio Free Europe website displayed photos of the handwritten asylum request signed by Vashukevich. Vashukevich stated that she had information about the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.  Resignation  In May 2018, The New York Times reported that Nielsen considered resigning after President Trump berated her during a cabinet meeting for what he described as her failure to secure U.S. borders. The newspaper reported that there was tension between Nielsen and Trump after she and other DHS officials resisted Trump's call to separate undocumented immigrant parents from their children while in custody. The reporting was confirmed to Politico and Reuters by a source at the DHS. Nielsen denied that she threatened to resign. Nielsen submitted her resignation as secretary of homeland security on April 7, 2019, after a White House meeting with President Trump, two days after the President announced he wanted to go in a \\"tougher\\" direction on immigration. She had cut short a week-long trip to Europe where she was going to discuss cybersecurity and terror threats with senior United Kingdom and Swedish government officials. Trump also had tweeted, on April 7, that Kevin McAleenan, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, would become acting secretary. Trump announced that intention following the resignation of Nielsen on April 7, 2019. Legally, under 6 U.S.C. ¬ß113(g), the role would have fallen to then Acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady. That succession was made legal after Trump forced Grady, the next in line, to resign on April 9. In a tweet, Nielsen had said that she had agreed to remain in her position until April 10, 2019 \\"to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted.\\" On April 5, immigration and civil rights groups had urged companies listed in the Fortune 500 not to hire senior Trump administration officials who were involved in planning, carrying out, or defending the separation of migrant children from their parents. On April 8, a petition aimed at scholars and media figures began circulating, with signers vowing not to \\"associate myself in any way\\" with any think tank or university department that employs Nielsen. In a piece summarizing Nielsen's tenure at DHS, Vox's Dara Lind wrote that Nielsen had been \\"arguably the most aggressive secretary in the department's short history\\".

In the middle of the tunnel the gradient begins to decline, with the Kotagala railway station being approximately lower than the Hatton railway station. The tunnel was designed by Sir Guilford Lindsey Molesworth, the first Director-General of Railways in Ceylon (1865-1871) and constructed by F. W. Faviell. The tunnel's construction represented a significant engineering feat at the time, as it was bored from both ends meeting in the middle. The tunnel was named the Poolbank tunnel as it runs under the Poolbank tea estate, which was established in 1880. It is also called Singha Malai tunnel, after a nearby rock formation, Singha is Tamil for 'Lion' and Malai for 'Mountain'.

It is a solution to the crystallographic phase problem, where phase information is lost during a diffraction measurement. Direct methods provides a method of estimating the phase information by establishing statistical relationships between the recorded amplitude information and phases of strong reflections. Background Phase Problem In electron diffraction, a diffraction pattern is produced by the interaction of the electron beam and the crystal potential. The real space and reciprocal space information about a crystal structure can be related through the Fourier transform relationships shown below, where f(\\\\textbf{r}) is in real space and corresponds to the crystal potential, and F(\\\\textbf{k}) is its Fourier transform in reciprocal space. The vectors \\\\textbf{r} and \\\\textbf{k} are position vectors in real and reciprocal space, respectively. : f(\\\\textbf{r}) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(\\\\textbf{k}) e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\textbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{r}} dk : F(\\\\textbf{k}) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(\\\\textbf{r}) e^{-2\\\\pi i\\\\textbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{r}} dr F(\\\\textbf{k}), also known as the structure factor, is the Fourier transform of a three-dimensional periodic function (i.e. the periodic crystal potential), and it defines the intensity measured during a diffraction experiment. F(\\\\textbf{k}) can also be written in a polar form F(\\\\textbf{g}), where \\\\textbf{g} is a specific reflection in reciprocal space. F(\\\\textbf{g}) has an amplitude term (i.e. F(\\\\textbf{g})) and a phase term (i.e. e^{i\\\\phi_g}). The phase term contains the position information in this form. : F(\\\\textbf{g}) = F(\\\\textbf{g}) e^{i\\\\phi_g} During a diffraction experiment, the intensity of the reflections are measured as I(\\\\textbf{g}): : I(\\\\textbf{g}) = F(\\\\textbf{g})^2 This is a straightforward method of obtaining the amplitude term of the structure factor. However, the phase term, which contains position information from the crystal potential, is lost. Analogously, for electron diffraction performed in a transmission electron microscope, the exit wave function of the electron beam from the crystal in real and reciprocal space can be written respectively as: : \\\\psi(\\\\textbf{r}) = a(\\\\textbf{r}) e^{-i\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{r})} : \\\\Psi(\\\\textbf{u}) = A(\\\\textbf{u}) e^{-i\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{u})} Where a(\\\\textbf{r}) and A(\\\\textbf{u}) are amplitude terms, the exponential terms are phase terms, and \\\\textbf{u} is a reciprocal space vector. When a diffraction pattern is measured, only the intensities can be extracted. A measurement obtains a statistical average of the moduli: : I(\\\\textbf{r}) = \\\\langle \\\\psi(\\\\textbf{r})^2 \\\\rangle = \\\\langle a(\\\\textbf{r})^2 \\\\rangle : I(\\\\textbf{u}) = \\\\langle \\\\Psi(\\\\textbf{u})^2 \\\\rangle = \\\\langle A(\\\\textbf{u})^2 \\\\rangle Here, it is also clear that the phase terms are lost upon measurement in an electron diffraction experiment. This is referred to as the crystallographic phase problem. History In 1952, David Sayre introduced the Sayre equation, a construct that related the known phases of certain diffracted beams to estimate the unknown phase of another diffracted beam. In the same issue of Acta Crystallographica, Cochran and Zachariasen also independently derived relationships between the signs of different structure factors. Later advancements were done by other scientists, including Hauptman and Karle, leading to the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1985) to Hauptman and Karle for their development of direct methods for the determination of crystal structures. Comparison to X-Ray Direct Methods The majority of direct methods was developed for X-ray diffraction. However, electron diffraction has advantages in several applications. Electron diffraction is a powerful technique for analyzing and characterizing nano- and micron-sized particles, molecules, and proteins. While electron diffraction is often dynamical and more complex to understand compared to X-ray diffraction, which is usually kinematical, there are specific cases (detailed later) that have sufficient conditions for applying direct methods for structure determination. Theory Unitary Sayre Equation The Sayre equation was developed under certain assumptions taken from information about the crystal structure, specifically that all atoms considered are identical and there is a minimum distance between atoms. Called the \\"Squaring Method,\\" a key concept of the Sayre equation is that squaring the electron-density function (for X-ray diffraction) or crystal potential function (for electron diffraction) results in a function that resembles the original un-squared function of identical and resolved peaks. By doing so, it reinforces atom-like features of the crystal. Consider the structure factor F(\\\\textbf{k}) in the following form, where f(\\\\textbf{k}) is the atomic scattering factor for each atom at position \\\\textbf{k}, and \\\\textbf{r} is the position of atom l: : F(\\\\textbf{k}) = \\\\sum_l f(\\\\textbf{k}) e^{2 \\\\pi \\\\textbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{r}_{l}} This can be converted to the unitary structure factor U(\\\\textbf{k}) by dividing by N (the number of atoms) and f(\\\\textbf{k}): : U(\\\\textbf{k}) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_l e^{2 \\\\pi \\\\textbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{r}_{l}} This can be alternatively rewritten in real and reciprocal space as: : u(\\\\textbf{r}) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_l \\\\delta (\\\\textbf{r}-\\\\textbf{r}_{l}) = N u(\\\\textbf{r})^2 : U(\\\\textbf{k}) = N \\\\sum_h U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{h}) Equation~\\\\ref{eqn:sayre} is a variation of the Sayre equation. Based on this equation, if the phases of U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) and U(\\\\textbf{h}) are known, then the phase of U(\\\\textbf{k}) is known. Triplet Phase Relationship The triplet phase relationship is an equation directly relating two known phases of diffracted beams to the unknown phase of another. This relationship can be easily derived via the Sayre equation, but it may also be demonstrated through statistical relationships between the diffracted beams, as shown here. For randomly distributed atoms, the following holds true: : N \\\\langle U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{h}) \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_l e^{2 \\\\pi i \\\\textbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{r}_l} = U(\\\\textbf{k}) Meaning that if: : U(\\\\textbf{k}) \\\\approx N \\\\langle U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{h}) \\\\rangle Then: : U(\\\\textbf{k}) - N U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{k})^2 = U(\\\\textbf{k})^2 + N^2 U(\\\\textbf{k-h})U(\\\\textbf{h})^2 - 2 N U(\\\\textbf{k}) U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{h}) \\\\times cos(\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h})) In the above equation, \\\\langle U(\\\\textbf{k}) - N U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{k})^2 \\\\rangle = 0 and the moduli are known on the right hand side. The only unknown terms are contained in the cosine term that includes the phases. The central limit theorem can be applied here, which establishes that distributions tend to be Gaussian in form. By combining the terms of the known moduli, a distribution function can be written that is dependent on the phases: : P(U(\\\\textbf{k}) - N U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{k})) \\\\approx C e^{-U(\\\\textbf{k}) - N U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{k})^2} : P(U(\\\\textbf{k}) - N U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{k})) \\\\approx D e^{2 N U(\\\\textbf{k}) - N U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{k}) \\\\times cos(\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h}))} This distribution is known as the Cochran distribution. The standard deviation for this Gaussian function scales with the reciprocal of the unitary structure factors. If they are large, then the sum in the cosine term must be: : \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h}) \\\\approx 2n\\\\pi,~~n = 0, 1, 2... : \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k}) \\\\approx \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h}) This is called the triplet phase relationship (\\\\Sigma_2). If the phases \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h}) and \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h}) are known, then the phase \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k}) can be estimated. Tangent Formula The tangent formula was first derived in 1955 by Jerome Karle and Herbert Hauptman. It related the amplitudes and phases of known diffracted beams to the unknown phase of another. Here, it is derived using the Cochran distribution. : \\\\prod_h P(U(\\\\textbf{k}) - N U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{k})) \\\\approx 2 N C e^{\\\\sum_h U(\\\\textbf{k}) U(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{k}) \\\\times cos(\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h}) - \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h}))} The most probable value of \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h}) can be found by taking the derivative of the above equation, which gives a variant of the tangent formula: : tan(\\\\varphi(\\\\textbf{k})) \\\\approx \\\\frac{ \\\\sum_h U(\\\\textbf{k}) - NU(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{h})  sin \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h}) + \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h}) }{\\\\sum_h U(\\\\textbf{k}) - NU(\\\\textbf{k-h}) U(\\\\textbf{h})  cos \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h}) + \\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h})} Practical Considerations The basis behind the phase problem is that phase information is more important than amplitude information when recovering an image. This is because the phase term of the structure factor contains the positions. However, the phase information does not need to be retrieved completely accurately. Often even with errors in the phases, a complete structure determination is possible. Likewise, amplitude errors will not severely impact the accuracy of the structure determination. Sufficient Conditions In order to apply direct methods to a set of data for successful structure determination, there must be reasonable sufficient conditions satisfied by the experimental conditions or sample properties. Outlined here are several cases. * Kinematical Diffraction One of the reasons direct methods was originally developed for analyzing X-ray diffraction is because almost all X-ray diffraction is kinematical. While most electron diffraction is dynamical, which is more difficult to interpret, there are instances in which mostly kinematical scattering intensities can be measured. One specific example is surface diffraction in plan view orientation. When analyzing the surface of a sample in plan view, the sample is often tilted off a zone axis in order to isolate the diffracted beams of the surface from those of the bulk. Achieving kinematical conditions is difficult in most cases‚Äîit requires very thin samples to minimize dynamical diffraction. * Statistical Kinematical Diffraction Even though most cases of electron diffraction are dynamical, it is still possible to achieve scattering that is statistically kinematical in nature. This is what enables the analysis of amorphous and biological materials, where dynamical scattering from random phases add up to be nearly kinematical. Furthermore, as explained earlier, it is not critical to retrieve phase information completely accurately. Errors in the phase information are tolerable. Recalling the Cochran distribution and considering a logarithm of that distribution: : D(\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k})-\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h})-\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h})) = A(\\\\textbf{k,h}) \\\\sqrt[]{I(\\\\textbf{k}) I(\\\\textbf{k-h}) I(\\\\textbf{h})} \\\\times cos (\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k})-\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h})-\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h})) : D(\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k})-\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h})-\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h})) = B(\\\\textbf{k,h}) cos(\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k})-\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k-h})-\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{h})) In the above distribution, A(\\\\textbf{k}) contains normalization terms, I(\\\\textbf{k}) terms are the experimental intensities, and B(\\\\textbf{k,h}) contains both of these for simplicity. Here, the most probable phases will maximize the function D(\\\\textbf{k,h}). If the intensities are sufficiently high and the sum in the cosine term remains \\\\approx 0, then B(\\\\textbf{k,h}) will also be large, thereby maximizing D(\\\\textbf{k,h}). With a narrow distribution such as this, the scattering data will be statistically within the realm of kinematical consideration. * Intensity Mapping Consider two scattered beams with different intensities. The magnitude of their intensities will then have to be related to the amplitude of their corresponding scattering factors by the relationship: : I(\\\\textbf{k}) > I(\\\\textbf{k'})~~ iff~F(\\\\textbf{k}) > F(\\\\textbf{k'}) Let T(\\\\textbf{k}) be a function that relates the intensity to the phase for the same beam, where N(\\\\textbf{k}) contains normalization terms: : T(\\\\textbf{k}) = e^{i\\\\phi(\\\\textbf{k})} \\\\sqrt[]{I(\\\\textbf{k})}/N(\\\\textbf{k}) Then, the distribution of T(\\\\textbf{k}) values will be directly related to the values of F(\\\\textbf{k}). That is, when the product F(\\\\textbf{k})F(\\\\textbf{k-h})F(\\\\textbf{h}) is large or small, T(\\\\textbf{k})T(\\\\textbf{k-h})T(\\\\textbf{h}) will also be large and small. So, the observed intensities can be used to reasonably estimate the phases for diffracted beams. The observed intensity can be related to the structure factor more formally using the Blackman formula. Other cases to consider for intensity mapping are specific diffraction experiments, including powder diffraction and precession electron diffraction. Specifically, precession electron diffraction produces a quasi-kinematical diffraction pattern that can be used adequately in direct methods. * Dominated Scattering In some cases, scattering from a sample can be dominated by one type of atom. Therefore, the exit wave from the sample will also be dominated by that atom type. For example, the exit wave and intensity of a sample dominated by channeling can be written in reciprocal space in the form: : \\\\Psi(\\\\textbf{k}) = A(\\\\textbf{k}) \\\\sum_l e^{2 \\\\pi i \\\\textbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{r}_l} : I(\\\\textbf{k}) = A(\\\\textbf{k})^2 \\\\bigg \\\\sum_l e^{2 \\\\pi i \\\\textbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{r}_l} \\\\bigg^2 A(\\\\textbf{k}) is the Fourier transform of a(\\\\textbf{r}), which is complex and represents the shape of an atom, given by the channeling states (e.g. 1s, 2s, etc.). A(\\\\textbf{k}) is real in reciprocal space and complex in the object plane. If B(\\\\textbf{k}), a conjugate symmetric function, is substituted for A(\\\\textbf{k}), then it is feasible to retrieve atom-like features from the object plane: : B(\\\\textbf{k}) = S(\\\\textbf{k}) A(\\\\textbf{k}), where ~S(\\\\textbf{k}) = \\\\pm 1 In the object plane, the Fourier transform of B(\\\\textbf{k}) will be a real and symmetric pseudoatom (b(\\\\textbf{r})) at the atomic column positions. b(\\\\textbf{r}) will satisfy atomistic constraints as long as they are reasonably small and well-separated, thereby satisfying some constraints required for implementing direct methods. Implementation Direct methods is a set of routines for structure determination. In order to successfully solve for a structure, several algorithms have been developed for direct methods. A selection of these are explained below. Gerchberg-Saxton The Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm was originally developed by Gerchberg and Saxton to solve for the phase of wave functions with intensities known in both the diffraction and imaging planes. However, it has been generalized for any information in real or reciprocal space. Detailed here is a generalization using electron diffraction information. As illustrated in image to the right, one can successively impose real space and reciprocal constraints on an initial estimate until it converges to a feasible solution. The generalized Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for direct methods with electron diffraction. By successively applying constraints, the algorithm will eventually converge to a possible solution. Modified from. Constraints Constraints can be physical or statistical. For instance, the fact that the data is produced by a scattering experiment in a transmission electron microscope imposes several constraints, including atomicity, bond lengths, symmetry, and interference. Constraints may also be statistical in origin, as shown earlier with the Cochran distribution and triplet phase relationship (\\\\Sigma_2). According to Combettes, image recovery problems can be considered as a convex feasibility problem. This idea was adapted by Marks et al. to the crystallographic phase problem. With a feasible set approach, constraints can be considered convex (highly convergent) or non- convex (weakly convergent). Imposing these constraints with the algorithm detailed earlier can converge towards unique or non-unique solutions, depending on the convexity of the constraints. Examples Direct methods with electron diffraction datasets have been used to solve for a variety of structures. As mentioned earlier, surfaces are one of the cases in electron diffraction where scattering is kinematical. As such, many surface structures have been solved for by both X-ray and electron diffraction direct methods, including many of the silicon, magnesium oxide, germanium, copper, and strontium titanate surfaces. More recently, methods for automated three dimensional electron diffraction methods have been developed, such as automated diffraction tomography and rotation electron diffraction. These techniques have been used to obtain data for structure solution through direct methods and applied for zeolites, thermoelectrics, oxides, metal-organic frameworks, organic compounds, and intermetallics. In some of these cases, the structures were solved in combination with X-ray diffraction data, making them complementary techniques. In addition, some success has been found using direct methods for structure determination with the cryo-electron microscopy technique Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED). MicroED has been used for a variety of materials, including crystal fragments, proteins, and enzymes. Software DIRDIF DIRDIF is a computer program for structure determination through using the Patterson function and direct methods applied to difference structure factors. It was first released by Paul Beurkens and his colleagues at the University of Nijmegen in 1999. It is written in Fortran and was most recently updated in 2008. It can be used for structures with heavy atoms, structures of molecules with partly known geometries, and for certain special case structures. Detailed information can be found at its website: http://www.xtal.science.ru.nl/dirdif/software/dirdif.html. EDM Electron Direct Methods is a set of programs developed at Northwestern University by Professor Laurence Marks. First released in 2004, its most recent release was version 3.1 in 2010. Written in C++, C, and Fortran 77, EDM is capable of performing image processing of high resolution electron microscopy images and diffraction patterns and direct methods. It has a standard GNU license and is free to use or modify for non-commercial purposes. It uses a feasible set approach and genetic algorithm search for solving structures using direct methods, and it also has high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image simulation capabilities.

OASIS OASIS was first written by several scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Fortran 77. The most recent release is version 4.2 in 2012. It is a program for direct methods phasing of protein structures. The acronym OASIS stands for two of its applications: phasing One-wavelength Anomalous Scattering or Single Isomorphous Substitution protein data. It reduces the phase problem to a sign problem by locating the atomic sites of anomalous scatterers or heavy atom substitutions.

Simultaneous toxic action of zinc and alachlor result an increase in uptake of metal in this fungus but disrupts the cell membrane. Paecilomyces marquandii is known to parasitize the mushroom, Cuphophyllus virgineus, in the family, Hygrophoraceae. Paecilomyces marquandii is categorised as a biosafety risk group 1 in Canada and is not thought to be a significant pathogen of humans or animals. History  The genus Verticillium was erected by British mycologist G.E. Massee in 1898 to accommodate Verticillium marquandii. This species was initially thought conspecific with Spicaria violacea based on its pattern of cell wall division. The fungus was transferred to the genus Paecilomyces as Paecilomyces marquandii by Canadian mycologist Stanley John Hughes in 1951 because of its morphological inconsistency with the emerging, modern concept of Verticillium Paecilomyces marquandii is often confused with Purpureocillium lilacinum because of their similar brownish-violet colony colors and bright yellow reverse pigmentation. In 2014, Metarhizium marquandii was introduced to accommodate this species, but it is considered a synonym. Growth and morphology Paecilomyces marquandii is an anamorphic eurotiomycete. It forms brush-like conidiophores borne on thin-walled, hyaline, and smooth-walled stalks that reach lengths from 50 to 300 Œºm and 2.5 to 3 Œºm wide. Conidiophores of P. marquandii resemble those of the genus Penicillium where brush-like conidiophores terminate with phialides with swollen bases and tapered necks 8 to 15 Œºm long and 1.5 to 2 Œºm wide. Conidia are produced in connected chains consisting of smooth walled hyaline broadly ellipsoidal to spindle-shaped spores, 3 to 3.5 Œºm long and 2.2 Œºm wide. Single phialides are not associated with conidiophores but may arise on vegetative aerial hyphae. Globe to ellipsoid chlamydospores 3.5 Œºm in diameter may be produced submerged in the growth medium beneath the mycelium. No sexual state is known. Colonies are odorless. Paecilomyces marquandii can grow at wide range of temperature from with optimal growth at 25 ¬∞C but no growth above 37 ¬∞C. Temperature tolerance is a characteristic that distinguishes Paecilomyces marquandii from Purpureocillium lilacinum with the latter exhibiting growth above 37 ¬∞C. Colonies of P. marquandii grown on malt agar reach 5‚Äì7 cm in diameter in 14 days at 25 ¬∞C with a velvety, brownish-violet aerial mycelium occasionally producing short tufts of conidiophores called synnemata. Colonies begin as white becoming violet then dark vinaceous brown with bright yellow to orange yellow reverse at maturity. Optimal growth of P. marquandii occurs at a water potential of 45 bars. Growth is inhibited at atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide less than 3%. Paecilomyces marquandii exhibits antagonism towards Rhizoctonia solani and other fungi. However, it exerts stimulatory effects on some crop plants including corn. Physiology Paecilomyces marquandii utilizes starch, gelatin, chitin, and nitrite. Cellulose decomposition is absent or very poor. Paecilomyces marquandii is characterised by high tolerance to metals such as zinc, copper and lead. This fungus is proficient at taking up minerals and heavy metals from soil particularly at high pH conditions, although very high concentrations of metals disrupt the cell membrane. This species is also able to take up and decompose the banned herbicide alachlor and break it down by nitrogen acetyl oxidation. P. marquandii produces highly active, specific keratinases. In presence of keratin chips with phosphate and magnesium ions, it forms large quantities of struvite crystals. Oxygen uptake of P. marquandii is reduced by saturated 8-11 carbon chain fatty acids as a sole carbon source but favoured by compounds with shorter or longer fatty acid chains. Optimum pH for P. marquandii growth is 5-6. It is sensitive to organic chemicals like carbon disulfide. Habitat and ecology Paecilomyces marquandii has been isolated from soils in Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Russia, United States, Canada, Spain, Turkey, Israel, Syria, Zaire, central Africa, the Ivory Coast, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Brazil, Central America, New Zealand, and Japan. It has been found in various types of soils including forest soils, under aspen forests, mixed hardwood with high humus accumulation, grasslands particularly in the upper soil layers, soils with steppe-type vegetation, arable and other cultivated soils down to a depth of 40 cm. This species has been found in agricultural fields treated with sewage sludge, in sewage sludge itself, streams with a lower degree of pollution, river sediments, estuarine slit, sand dunes, carst caves, and bat guano. It has been also isolated from pine litter, pine humus, peat, truffle grounds, roots of strawberry, the rhizosphere of corn, wheat, grasses, Beta vulgaris, and sugar cane and the rhizosphere of Lupinus angustifolius. Conidia of P. marquandii have been observed to germinate near roots of peas and radish. This effect is inhibited in the presence of the fungicide, miconazole. Human and animal disease This species has been reported as an agent of cellulitis on the leg of an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient receiving corticosteroid therapy. Successful control of disseminated P. marquandii infection was obtained with miconazole. The fungus has exhibited tolerance to amphotericin B and flucytosine. It is not thought to be a significant pathogen of humans or animals.

Life and work Joseph Swan was born 11 November 1796 in Manchester England to Thomas Swan and Janet Russell. He started his career in what had become his hometown of Edinburgh as an apprentice to engraver John Beugo and worked with other engravers. In August 1817, he married Margaret Thomson in Edinburgh before setting off to Glasgow. There he took over the engraving business established by Charles Dearie, who died 28 November 1818.Smith, George Fairfull, ‚ÄòJoseph Swan (1796-1872) engraver and publisher‚Äô, The Private Library Fourth Series Vol 10:2 Summer 1997, pp 81-92 ISSN 0032-8898 Swan was one of a number of engravers and printers in Glasgow whose business encompassed pictures, portraits, maps, bookplates, plans, invoices, bills, bank notes, and silver work. One of his commissions was to illustrate rare plants in the collection of the Royal Botanic Institute of Glasgow.Hunnisett, Basil. Steel engraved book illustration in England, (Scholar Press, London), 1980 In 1836 Swan was one of the first to apply steam to the lithographic printing process. He employed staff who specialised in a particular area such as pictures, letter and seal engraving. They included Robert Charles Bell who, like Swan, had worked with John Beugo in Edinburgh and Thomas Annan, later known for his photographic work.Smith, George Fairfull, ‚ÄòJoseph Swan (1796-1872) engraver and publisher‚Äô, The Private Library Fourth Series Vol 10:2 Summer 1997, pp 81-92 ISSN 0032-8898 Swan's reputation was established by his engraved illustrations of Scottish towns and landscapes which were based on pictures by contemporary Scottish artists such as John Fleming, John Knox, Andrew Donaldson, James Stewart and William Brown. The first major work, Views of Scotland and its environs, appeared in 1826 with accompanying text by John Leighton and sold at five shillings and sixpence for fine proof impressions on India paper and four shillings and sixpence for common impressions. To ensure the commercial success of such a project, subscribers were required to make payments in advance of publication to ensure that the work could proceed. Subscribers for the Views of Glasgow included the Duchess of Montrose, the Lord Provost of Glasgow and Archibald McLellan, a founder of the civic art collection. The engravings were made from pictures produced by Greenock-based John Fleming, Glasgow‚Äôs John Knox and Swan himself. The thirty-three plates include views of the city from different vantage points, the leading thoroughfares, buildings, and districts. Contemporary newspapers praised the work both for its choice of subjects and the quality of workmanship. Following the success of the Select Views of Glasgow, Swan published part one of the Select Views on the River Clyde in February 1828. The engravings for the series were taken from pictures by John Fleming and Andrew Donaldson. They were larger than the Glasgow set and the price rose accordingly. By February 1830 the series was complete and included views of country houses such as Blythswood, Carstairs, Erskine and Hamilton Place plus Helensburgh, Greenock, Rothesay, and Campbelltown. Then followed Views of the Lakes of Scotland, the first part of which was published in 1830. Swan was keen to point out to potential subscribers and purchasers that the work was of national importance as it was the first to group together Highland and Lowland lochs and included many of the lesser-known ones. He attracted well over 1000 subscribers from throughout Britain. All the engravings were based on pictures by John Fleming and the text was by Leighton with an introduction by Professor Wilson. From 1832 to 1836 Swan‚Äôs entry in the Post Office Directory shows him as ‚Äòengraver and publisher of the Lakes of Scotland‚Äô. Two works by Charles Mackie, Historical Description of the Abbey and Town of Paisley (1835) and Historical Description of the Town of Dundee (1836), contain Swans engravings. The Paisley views were all based on Swan‚Äôs own artwork while the Dundee volume contains both his work and that of James Stewart. Stewart provided the artwork for the History of the County of Fyfe (1840), Sir William Hooker‚Äôs Perthshire Illustrated (1843), also has Swan‚Äôs engravings after Stewart, William Brown, Andrew Donaldson and D. MacKenzie. Swan‚Äôs engravings appear in further works including Strathclutha; or the Beauties of Clyde (1839), which combines views from the Glasgow and Clyde series; The Topographical, Statistical and Historical Gazetteer of Scotland (1845); and the new edition of James Browne‚Äôs A History of the Highlands and of the Highland Clans. Joseph Swan was a committee member and for some time treasurer of the Glasgow Mechanics‚Äô Institution which was founded in 1832. From January 1824, the institution published a very successful magazine which included many of his engravings such as portraits of James Watt and John Anderson, founder of Anderson‚Äôs institution, and the numerous mechanical inventions and improvements discussed in the text. A key figure in Glasgow‚Äôs art world, Swan co-founded the Glasgow Dilettanti Society in 1825 to promote interest in the fine arts among the city‚Äôs artists, art collectors and connoisseurs. He was an honorary member of the West of Scotland Academy of the Fine Arts, founded in 1841, to which his firms supplied printed material. In the same year, he was on the management committee and treasurer of the newly founded Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for the Promotion of the Fine Arts, an art union. Swan operated his business from a number of locations through his career. These included different addresses in the Trongate between 1818 and 1841 when he relocated to St Vincent Street, adjacent to the Western Club. Other premises were at Exchange Square, Bothwell Street, Buchannan Street, and Parliamentary Road where the renowned Swan‚Äôs Universal Copy Books were manufactured for use in schools worldwide. He was listed in the Post Office Directory as an engraver and lithographer into the 1860s. Family He lived with his family at various locations in Glasgow between 1818 and his death in 1872. Some survive such as the villa at 114 Hill Street, Garnethill and 21 Sandyforth place, Sauchiehall Street, where he died 22 September 1872. His first wife with whom he had eight children, Margaret Thomson, died in 1836 and he later married Helen Gourlay Cumming with whom he had seven children. He was buried at the Glasgow Necropolis where his monument stands. The monument is a valuable record of his family including nine of his children who predeceased him, though it does not include the names of four daughters who survived him. It also hints at his religious convictions and support for overseas missionary work.‚ÄòA Glasgow Octogenarian [Swan‚Äôs daughter]‚Äô, The Glasgow Herald, 7 November 1911 p 1  References  1796 births 1872 deaths Artists from Manchester People from Glasgow People from Edinburgh British engravers British publishers (people) ","title":"Joseph Swan (engraver)"},{"id":"55166896","title":"All American Made"},{"id":"55166931","title":"Tamkuhi Raj (Assembly constituency)"},{"id":"55166934","text":"USS LST-30 was a United States Navy used exclusively in the Europe- Africa-Middle East Theater during World War II.

Early life Burrard was born on the Isle of Wight in a family of eminence, his father being Lieutenant-Colonel Sidney Burrard of the Grenadier Guards. Their home at The Mount had been built by his grandfather, The Reverend Sir George Burrard. He was educated at school in Lymington and then Uppingham School from 1873 where he showed his mathematical talents. In 1874 he moved to Wellington College where again he excelled at mathematics which led his father to decide that he was suited for the Royal Engineers. Career He received a commission in the Royal Engineers on 6 April 1879 and trained at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham. He sailed to India in 1882. He joined the Bengal Sappers and Miners at Roorkee and then joined the Zhob valley expedition in Baluchistan. In 1884 he joined the Survey of India after a contemporary W.H. Pollen, who was posted as Aide- de-camp to the Viceroy, heard that there was a position for a young Royal Engineer who was good at mathematics and recommended Burrard's name to Lord Ripon. Burrard worked at Dehra Dun under J.B.N. Hennessey and C.T. Haig. Working with Heaviside and Strahan, he examined the causes of minute triangulation errors. These they determined by experiments as being caused by the attraction of the plumbline to the Himalayan mountains. This was further analysed by John Henry Pratt. In 1887 Burrard married Gertrude Ellen the daughter of the Superintendent of the Trigonometrical Survey, Major-General C.T. Haig. Burrard went on furlough in 1890 to England where his wife, an artist, spent time to study painting. During this time Burrard worked on a family genealogy. Burrard later worked at a tidal observatory on the Red Sea. In 1899 he was appointed Superintendent of the Trigonometrical Survey and became a Surveyor General in 1908. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) in 1911, and promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in 1914. In 1913 he received the Victoria Medal from the Royal Geographical Society. Burrard helped to organized the Indian Science Congress. He left India in 1919 and retired to Farnborough. Lady Burrard died in 1928. They had a son and a daughter. He succeeded his cousin as a baronet on 1933 and in 1935 he married Alice Simons but she died in 1938.

He is largely credited with getting the sport of triathlon into the Olympic Games, with the inaugural race taking place at the Games of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney, Australia, in 2000. He is a member of the Triathlon Canada Hall of Fame (2001), Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame (2007), the BC Sports Hall of Fame (2009), and the ITU Hall of Fame (2014). He was awarded the Olympic Order in 2010, in Vancouver, by the International Olympic Committee. He was inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada in 2013 by His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada.  Personal life  Les McDonald was born to a coal miner and a newspaper shopkeeper and grew up in Felling, a borough near Newcastle upon Tyne (where he was born), in the northeast of England, in 1933. He was the eldest of 3 children. He left school at the age of 14 to work in the coal mines and help support his family. He completed two years of military service and was part of the British army of occupation of Germany in the post-war period, which would eventually lead to him meeting his wife, Monique. In 1955, he immigrated to Vancouver, BC, where he married and had 3 children. As a young man in the northeast of England, he had discovered rock climbing and skiing. He became a legendary rock climber and would go on to achieve many first ascents in Canada, some with the legendary Fred Beckey. He then continued his passion for skiing, coaching at Grouse Mountain and Whistler Mountain. He helped form the Alta Lake Sports Club based out of Whistler, BC, Canada, and competed in several cross country ski marathons including the Engadin Skimarathon. During his early professional life, he worked as an electrician and labor union organizer with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. His prowess in sports administration and organization were heavily influenced by his experiences as a labour unionist.  Triathlon  Les discovered Triathlon in the 1980s while cross-training for marathons. In 1981, he organized one of the first triathlons in Canada, which took place in Vancouver. He founded the British Columbia Triathlon Federation in 1983, followed by Triathlon Canada in 1984. He was President of Triathlon Canada from 1984-1996, and a member of the Canadian Olympic Committee Board of Directors. He was a five-time Ironman Age Group World Champion in the 50-55 age class from 1983 to 1987, setting consecutive age group record times in the process. He spent much of his own time and money traveling around the world setting up national triathlon governing bodies ahead of the 1989 World Championship and the inaugural International Triathlon Union (ITU) Congress in Avignon, France where he was elected President of the ITU. He is largely credited with getting the sport of triathlon into the Olympic Games through years of tireless effort and dedication to the sport. He was a driving force in the sport of triathlon, and pushed feminist values including equal prize money, representation, and concurrent medal ceremonies for male and female athletes. He remained president of the ITU until 2008, retiring at the age of 75. He was appointed as Honorary President of the ITU and remained in that position until he passed away.

This was the first time any Democrat won the state more than twice. Roosevelt landslided Utah with 62.25 percent of the vote. The percentage, however, wasn‚Äôt as large as his victory in the state four years earlier. , this is the last election in which Piute County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\\" - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  1940 United States presidential election in Utah -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" Candidate ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Electoral votes - ! style=\\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Democratic  Franklin D.

This system divides the lobes of the liver into eight segments based on a transverse plane through the bifurcation of the main portal vein. Segments Shape of human liver in animation. Eight segments by Couinaud labelled. The fissure for the round ligament of the liver (ligamentum teres) also separates the medial and lateral segments. The medial segment is also called the quadrate lobe. In the widely used Couinaud classification, the lobes of the liver are further divided into eight segments based on a transverse plane through the bifurcation of the main portal vein. The caudate lobe is a separate structure which receives blood flow from both the right- and left-sided vascular branches. The Couinaud classification of liver anatomy divides the liver into eight functionally independent segments. Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. In the centre of each segment there is a branch of the portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct. In the periphery of each segment there is vascular outflow through the hepatic veins. The division of the liver into independent units means that segments can be resected without damaging the remaining segments. To preserve the viability of the liver following surgery, resections follow the vessels defining the peripheries of each segment. This means that resection lines parallel the hepatic veins, leaving the portal veins, bile ducts, and hepatic arteries intact. The classification system uses the vascular supply in the liver to separate the functional segments (numbered I to VIII): *Segment I is the caudate lobe and is situated posterior l and it may receive its supply from both the right and the left branches of portal vein. It contains one or more hepatic veins which drain directly into the IVC. The remainder of the segments (II to VIII) are numbered in a clockwise fashion: *Segments II and III lie lateral to the falciform ligament with II superior to the portal venous supply and III inferior *Segment IV lies medial to the falciform ligament and is subdivided into IVa (superior) and IVb (inferior) Segments V to VIII make up the right part of the liver: *Segment V is the most medial and inferior *Segment VI is located more posteriorly *Segment VII is located above segment VI *Segment VIII sits above segment V in the superio-medial position References External links * Radiopaedia overview Liver anatomy ","title":"Liver segment"},{"id":"55167729","text":"Robert Ritter may refer to: * Robert Ritter (1901‚Äì1951), a Nazi German psychiatrist who pursued forced sterilization of \\"Gypsies\\" (Roma, Sini, and Yenish) * Robert M.

The school is affiliated with West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education. History The school was founded by Jadunath Banerjee in the year of 1867. In the early days, initially the students studied free of cost, Some local philanthropists donated 4 annas to run this school . After a few years a minimum fees of 1 anna and 4 annas were charged for primary and secondary students. The Howrah Corporation had also extended its helping hand by donating Rs 7/- every month till the year 1898. Till 1925 the largest amount donated was Rs 40/-. Even though progress was visibly poor yet it preserved the freedom and motive behind starting such a school. In 1867 the school was started in a rented house in Sibpur area . In 1876 it was shifted to Kshetra Mohan Banerjee Lane to a 4 roomed rented house . But an earthquake unfortunately destroyed the house in 1869. The general public extended their helping hand and the school was restarted. In 1910 the school inspector was dissatisfied with where the school was housed and shifted it to Ananda Kr Roy Chowdhury Lane and the rent was Rs 1/- per month. The number of students rose from 168 to 200 in 1913 . In 1912, the inspector of schools of Presidency, Burdwan and Orissa division Miss Crawford inspected our school and being satisfied a government assistance of Rs 60/- was arranged to run the school . But for reasons otherwise the grant could not be made. So in 1913 a grant of Rs 20 /-per month was arranged which later went up to Rs 50/-per month .As the roll strength rose the school faced a space crunch. In 1914 at Sibpur Road a 3 Kotah land was acquired for construction of the school . The school managing committee asked for a one time aid of Rs 3000/- from the state government . But due to the 1st world war aid from the government was not provided. For 11 years the school functioned from its rented quarters. In 1930 another 4 Kotahs of land was added to its previous purchase of 3 Kotahs. In 1932 the construction of the school started . In 1935 the present school came into shape. In 1952 the Madhya Siksha Parishad granted an aid of Rs 46,247 to construct the building . Another aid of Rs 23,851 /- followed. Again in 1954 an additional 3 Kotahs of land was again purchased for Rs 11,580/- was spent on construction was aided with a help of Rs 5788/- from the Madhya Siksha parshad . At this time 22.5 Kotahs of land was purchased and an additional Rs 30,000/- was given by Madhya Siksha parshad In 1959, the west Bengal government provided Rs 50,000/- as financial help. From 1959 after Independence the state government has taken charge of running this school by extending financial assistance it. At the beginning the school had 6 classes . In 1990 it was reduced to 4 classes, In 1902 the classes were increased and got seven classes. Lower primary and upper primary classes resumed. By 1952 the school introduced education in the English language. By 1959 the school reached the Madhyamik and later Higher Secondary level. In 1964 the school received permission to open its science department. In 1968 commerce department was opened at the Hindu Girls‚Äô High School. At the time the school was set up, the member of teachers were only two. By this time the Primary section and Secondary section was functioning separately. In 1910 and 1914 two new teachers were inducted . In 1946 respected Lila De joined as the principal of this institution. She gave a vast contribution to the school. Initially the school started off with a few students. Fewer teachers resulted in fewer number of students in the school. Gradually things picked up . In 1901 there were around 60. In 1912 it was 168 and in 1913 it reached 200. An all high was in 1952 The number reached 500. Now the roll strength is about 2500. The success rate in H.S exams in 1964 was 75% and in 1965 it was 80%.

When creating this album, we wanted to go deeper than we had with previous Cub Sport releases.

It is a species of wood cockroach originally from southern Europe . It is completely harmless to humans and does not appear as a storage pest, as it only feeds on decomposing plant material and perishes within a few days in human dwellings due to a lack of food. Its original range is south of the Alps, but this species seems to have established itself permanently north of the Alps and in southern Germany. Since the amber forest cockroach is capable of flight, it accidentally finds its way into human dwellings, especially in areas close to its natural habitat. It is attracted by artificial light sources. Features The amber forest cockroach is a slender cockroach. The light brown body of the adult animal measuring between 9 to 14 mm long, the antennae are about twice as long as the body. The legs are noticeably thorny. The pronotum has a uniform light brown color and is translucent at the edge. In both sexes, the wings protrude above the tip of the abdomen, they are sometimes finely dotted. Normally the species can be distinguished from similar species in Central Europe by the uniformly pale, translucent pronotum. In case of doubt, further characteristics are to be used for a reliable determination. Their affiliation to the genus Ectobius can be seen in the thorns on the underside of the middle and rear thighs of the legs; these do not have rows of thorns, but only one or two thorns. The shape of the stylus (an attachment at the tip of the abdomen) and the shape of a glandular field on the upper side of the abdomen in the male are to be used for a reliable identification of the species. The ootheca of the female is 2.9 to 4.9 millimeters long and slightly curved lengthways. The dividing lines of the egg chambers shine through as fine transverse lines. The surface is sculptured with fine longitudinal ribs. The natural habitat of the amber forest cockroach is outdoors in low bushes and in gardens under pots. It feeds on decomposing plant material. Warm, dry summers can encourage mass reproduction. Then the probability is high that the animals can also be found in apartments. In size, shape and color, the amber forest cockroach is very similar to the German cockroach Blattella germanica, which is feared as a hygiene pest and is usually controlled. The most striking difference is the uniform brown pronotum in the amber forest cockroach, which in the German cockroach has two dark longitudinal stripes. While the German cockroach is usually only active at night, hiding during the day and flees from light, the amber forest cockroach is also diurnal. The adults of the amber forest cockroach are relatively capable of flight, while the adults of the German cockroach cannot fly either. Spread The amber wood cockroach is naturally widespread in southern Europe (Mediterranean region), north to south of the Alps. Since around 1999 the species has spread northwards. The first finds came from northern Switzerland (e.g. Zurich, Winterthur). It has been proven in Germany (Baden-W√ºrttemberg) since 2002. In 2006 Thuringia was reached, in 2011 the first record was made for Bavaria and Rhineland-Palatinate. Since 2015 it has been proven for North Rhine-Westphalia. Since 2018, it has been observed increasingly in Viennese gardens and garden apartments.

the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1996 Russian presidential election. Gorbachev's candidacy was beset by the obstacles of both minimal media coverage and a high level of disdain towards him amongst the Russian populace. Gorbachev's candidacy ended in defeat during the first round of the election. The effort was the first, and only, electoral campaign of Gorbachev's post-Soviet political career. Background Gorbachev had led the Soviet Union from March 1985 until its dissolution in December 1991. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin (whose rise to power Gorbachev had tried to prevent) became the Russian head-of-state. Gorbachev had, reportedly, been contemplating a political return since sometime in the middle of 1993. Gorbachev was still a vigorous and opinionated man. He desired to escape from his political exile and to repair his image. Gorbachev was also motivated, amid chaotic reform efforts by Yeltsin, by a belief that he could implement far superior (and less disastrous) reform than Yeltsin. Gorbachev also had a strong personal animosity towards Yeltsin. All of these factors motivated him to run for president. Apart from being the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the 1990 Russian legislative election, Gorbechev lacked previous involvement in electoral campaigns. His 1996 campaign effort would be his first time campaigning for office in a direct popular election. Campaigning On March 1, 1996, Gorbachev published an open letter outlining the need for an alternative to the candidacies of Boris Yeltsin and the Communist Party's Zyuganov.The New Russia by Mikhail Gorbachev He announced his candidacy the following day, marking the first time he had campaigned for a democratically elected office. Gorbachev resented both the incumbent independent Yeltsin and Zyuganov, who were the front-runners in the election. Gorbachev regarded the Communist Party and Yeltsin as being the two forces that thrust him out of power, and encouraged his supporters to abstain from voting in a second round if it were to be between those two candidates. Gorbachev believed that with a majority of Russians being dissatisfied with both front-runners, there was a viability for a third candidate, and viewed himself to be a suitable individual to fill that role. Upon announcing his campaign, Gorbechev proclaimed that, despite polls showing him having immense unpopularity, he would be able to win as the leader of a democratic coalition. He called for all democratic forces to unite and form a wide coalition, indicated his readiness to lead such a grouping. He claimed that there would be immense consequences for an election that merely presented the, \\"false choice\\" between Yeltsin and Communists. Gorbachev declared, \\"What they are offering is not a democratic future for Russia. That is why we must unite.\\" Gorbachev clarified that he intended to run even if such a coalition failed to materialize. A spokesperson for democratic political figure Grigory Yavlinsky indicated that with Gorbachev's unpopularity, such a coalition was, \\"not very realistic\\". Yavilinsky, however, did unsuccessfully attempt to form such a third force coalition with the campaigns of Alexander Lebed and Svyatoslav Fyodorov. Despite his unpopularity and low poll numbers, Gorbachev was quickly able to collect signatures. At a campaign appearance St. Petersburg, less than a month after declaring his candidacy, he announced that he had finished collecting more than the one million signatures needed to register his candidacy. Gorbachev soon after turned in more than 1.4 signatures, officially registering his candidacy. His candidacy was officially certified by the Central Election Commission on April 13. During the course of his candidacy, Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife Raisa, traveled the country to deliver stump speeches. Gorbachev regularly encountered hecklers. Gorbachev once responded to hecklers by exclaiming, On the stump, Gorbachev defended his record, claiming that he had tried to save the Soviet Union, but that he had been betrayed by both communist hard-liners and an ambitious Yeltsin. He additionally placed blame on the 1991 coup attempt for undermining his efforts to preserve the Soviet Union. In his speeches Gorbachev would often refer to himself in third-person. He spent most of his time on the campaign trail criticizing Yeltsin. Rather than being devoted to Gorbachev's candidacy, many audience members at Gorbachev's campaign events were motivated to attend out of the pure curioisity of seeing such a historically significant individual. Throughout his campaign Gorbachev would frequently face hasselers, and many times was spat on by individuals. At the end of April, in Moscow, Gorbachev delivered a speech in which he strongly criticized Yeltsin, accusing him of using illegal means to retain power. Gorbachev argued that Yeltsin had broken the law by creating an election committee consisting of serving government officials. He also stated having the chief of Independent Television serve on the president's reelection committee poses a threat to freedom of the press. He also claimed that he had held talks with the those seeking to form a third force coalition. He also indicated that would be willing to step aside for a stronger candidate. Incidents In the month of April, while campaigning in Omsk, a man struck Gorbachev. The incident was deemed by the press to have been a slap, however, Gorbechev insisted that it was an assassination attempt. Gorbachev alleged that the man was a special forces agent and had been attempting to deliver a fatal blow to his neck. The perpetrator was arrested. Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party proposed legislation to grant the man amnesty. Boris Finko, the sponsor of the bill, declared that, \\"He did what many dream of\\". Gorbachev alleged that the Liberal Democratic Party had been responsible for the incident, which he continued to refer to as an assassination attempt. On Victory Day, Gorbachev paid visit to Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad). He was met by hostile crowds, some of which jeerer him with chants deriding him as a \\"traitor\\". As he tried to place flowers at the city's war memorial, he was confronted by Viktor Anpilov and a group of Anpilov's supporters. They condemned Gorbachev for his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union, and held signs which read \\"No Place for Traitors on the Holy Ground of Stalingrad\\". Anpilov tried to get Gorbachev's wife Raisa to take flowers from him, and mocked her and her husband for being \\"rude ingrates\\" when she refused them. During a campaign trip through St. Petersburg local officials refused to allow Gorbachev to embark on visits that he had planned to take to three factories, with the officials telling Gorbachev that the factories were closed to visitors. Level of support Since leaving office, Gorbachev had become a celebrated figure in the West, receiving much credit for his role in peacefully ending the Cold War. However, Gorbachev had, at the same time, become a loathed figure in Russia, receiving blame for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Upon declaring his intent to run, Gorbachev polled at a mere 1%, and ultimately failed to subsequently build a greater level support. Opinion polling showed Gorbachev having immense unpopularity amongst the Russian people. Many communists blamed him for the collapse of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Union itself. Many market reform supporters blamed him for failing to finish reforms, plunging the Russian economy into chaos. Others disapproved of his candidacy, fearing he would do little more than split the anti-communist vote (playing the role of a spoiler). Even Gorbachev's hometown of Privolnoye greeted his candidacy with a cold reception. In Privolnoye, the New York Times quoted Mariak Gopkala, a second-cousin of Gorbachev, as expressing her support for the candidacy of Zyguyanov, declaring that Gorbachev, Gorbachev blamed the public's animosity towards him on a conspiracy between the Communist Party, Yeltsin's government and the media, which he alleged both was trying to silence him and was pushing what he alleged was a false narrative that blamed the end of the Soviet Union on him. Gorbechev claimed his low approval rating was a fabrication of a government plot against him, and insisted that he enjoyed a much greater level of support than was reflected in opinion polling. Gorbachev expressed confidence in his prospects, declaring, Besides from Gorbachev himself, relatively nobody believed him to have any chance of succeeding in his campaign. By some accounts, not even Gorbachev's own campaign team had much faith in his prospects. Weeks before the election, Gorbachev's wife Raisa, reportedly, had begun selling gowns that she had worn as the first lady of the Soviet Union, declaring that she did not believe she would be needing them again. In addition to having an outright lack of popular support, Gorbachev also lacked the financial support to mount a competitive campaign. Media coverage Gorbachev's campaign was given almost no national or local coverage. The rare coverage he did receive generally involved embarrassing incidents on the campaign trail. Gorbachev endured this lack of coverage throughout his candidacy. Izvestia failed to report on his initial declaration of candidacy, while evening news broadcasts gave it only a passing mention. Gorbachev received such little media coverage that many were unaware he was even running. At a press conference announcing his platform, Yeltsin criticized his lack of press coverage. He implored journalists to provide fair coverage to all candidates. Remarking on the lack of fair press, he claimed that media manipulation by Yeltsin was as severe as the media manipulation that the Soviet government oversaw during Leonid Brezhnev's leadership, saying, \\"I think the situation is much worse than in the years of Perestroika. We are watching the presidential campaign of a single candidate.\\" At one point, Gorbachev complained that he believed that there was less press freedom than when he was leader of the Soviet Union. Political positions Gorbachev described himself as a social democrat. This was in diametric contrast to Zyuganov, who strongly rebuked any implications of being a social democrat, and whose policies eschewed social democratic stances. Gorbachev asserted that, of those running for president, his was the voice of responsibility and moderation. Domestic affairs Without many specifics, Gorbechev pledged to increase industrial and agricultural production, and reform taxation. One of his top stated priorities was to reign in government corruption. Another top-priority of his was to ramp-up the nation's the \\"war on crime\\". As leader of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev had desired to implement more gradual reforms in an effort to preserve the country's socialism while providing a democratization of its society. This contrasted with many of the reforms which Yeltsin had implemented, which sought rapid change and disregarded the country's socialist structure. Gorbachev hoped that, if elected, he would be able to halt course and implement his own, more mild, vision of reforms. He hoped to create a social democratic state structure in Russia. Military affairs One of Gorbachev's top stated priorities was to put an end to the war in Chechnya. International affairs In early 1996, commenting on the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Gorbachev had declared that Russians viewed NATO as, \\"a war machine that is trying to take advantage of our troubled political and economic situation.\\" Conclusion Gorbachev cast his own vote on election day, June 16, 1996. He declared that he had voted for, \\"the most worthy candidate\\". He spent the night of the election in Moscow, with the company of Alexander Haig. Haig was in Moscow as part of an election monitoring team. Gorbachev received 386,069 votes (0.5% of the overall vote), placing seventh out of eleven candidates, and was, therefore, eliminated from campaigning in the second-round of the election. Gorbachev did not deliver a concession speech after the results of the election came in. Aftermath Gorbechev, subsequently, has questioned the validity of the election results. While he acknowledges that he lost by a significant margin, Gorbechev suspects that his actual vote count still exceeded what was reported in the official tally. In 2017, Gorbachev wrote in his book The New Russia that he believes that, \\"there have been no fair and free elections in Russia since those of 1989, 1990 and the election of 1991 when Boris Yeltsin became the first president of Russia.\\" References campaign 1996 Gorbachev ","title":"Mikhail Gorbachev 1996 presidential campaign"},{"id":"55168059","text":"Gi√¶ver (IPA: [ÀàjeÀêv…ôr]) is a Norwegian surname that may refer to *Anders Gi√¶ver (born 1961), Norwegian journalist and author *Ivar Giaever (born 1929), Norwegian-American physicist *Jo Gi√¶ver Tenfjord (1918‚Äì2007), Norwegian librarian, children's writer and translator *Joachim Gi√¶ver (1856‚Äì1925), Norwegian-born American civil engineer *John Schjelderup Gi√¶ver (1901‚Äì1970), Norwegian author and polar researcher **Giaever Glacier in Antarctica **Giaever Ridge in Antarctica *Knut T.

Serious negotiations to form a coalition were held between candidates Alexander Lebed, Grigory Yavlinsky and Svyatoslav Fyodorov. Alexander Rutskoy and Stanislav Govorukhin were approached to join the coalition, but gave their support to Zyuganov. Mikhail Gorbechev offered to lead a wide coalition but gained little support. Talks ultimately fell apart by early May, six weeks before the first round of the election. It was later revealed that Lebed had made a secret agreement with Yeltsin to support the latter in the second round of the election, after building up Lebed's campaign so that his endorsement would carry more support. Background Polls in early 1996 had demonstrated that the majority of voters did not like either Boris Yeltsin or Gennady Zyuganov. As a result, there was a real possibility that that support could coalesce around a third candidate, propelling them into the second round of the Russian presidential election. Many referred to this possible merging of support as a \\"third force\\". Intense speculation arose that a third force might arise from a coalition of non-Yeltsin supporters and non-Communist supporters. Speculation of a third force largely centered on a potential united bloc led by Alexander Lebed, Grigory Yavlinsky and Svyatoslav Fyodorov. Independently, none of their presidential candidacies stood a chance of making it to the second round. However, united, they believed that not only might they be able to retain the combined 15.5% of the vote that their parties had garnered in the 1995 legislative elections, but that they could also win a portion of the additional centrist voting population (which would be around 20 to 25% of the electorate). Even if it had only been able to garner half of the additional centrist voting population, combined with their existing 15.5% of support, it was thought to be enough to propel a united ticket into the second round of voting Hypothetical polling for the second round showed that both Lebed and Yavilinsky would be capable of defeating either Yeltsin or Zyuganov. Developments Winter 1996 On January 27, 1996, in his speech officially accepting Yabloko's nomination, Yavlinsky included overtures to Lebed. Yavlinsky stated that discussions about forming a coalition were underway with both Yegor Gaidar's party Democratic Choice of Russia and Lebed's party Congress of Russian Communities. At the time, Sergei Kovalev, a former Yeltsin ally who had recently sided as a strong critic of the president, remarked that Yavlkinsky's proposal for a coalition with Congress of Russian Communities was a risky proposition. At the same time, Ella Pamfilova (Duma deputy and the head of the Common Cause bloc) sought to convene a congress of all rightist, right-of-center and centrist parties and movements in order to nominate a united democratic candidate for president. The congress was to form a coalition consisting of groups from as far left as the Women of Russia and the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs to groups as far right as Democratic Choice of Russia. Pamfilova argued for such unification, stating, \\"The Communists are uniting; Zhirinovskyites have rallied to the party of power. Our only possible option today is to unite.\\" Pamfilova claimed to have heard interest from both Yavlinsky and Gaidar. The central issue that arose in negotiations for forming a third-force coalition between Lebed, Yavlinsky, and Fyodorov was determining which two would withdraw from the race to support the other. Each believed that they would be the strongest candidate. Proponents of a third force coalition discussed a number of means of deciding this, including holding a primary election or selecting the candidate with the highest public opinion ratings. However, none of these satisfied all three candidates. Efforts at negotiating stalled by early March, unable to agree on either a leader or a platform. They also lost some members, such as Alexander Rutskoy, to the Communists. A smaller group of leaders from that effort later regrouped to form a new third force group and hold new negotiations. This group consisted of Lebed, Svyatslav, Federov, and Yavlinsky. On March 15, Federov announced that he had conducted high-level discussions with both Lebed and Yavlinsky about forming a coalition. He promised that they would, in the near future, be releasing a joint statement about, \\"the Brezhnev-Stalinist socialism of the Communists and the wild west capitalism of Yeltsin.\\" He also claimed that the group would announce what candidate it would run by May 15, and that a primary-type system might be used to determine who it would be. Reportedly, Lebed was in favor of such a system, and Federov was beginning to lean in favor of it, while Yavlinsky was remained skeptical of it. The following day, the three candidates released a joint statement condemning the Duma's denunciation of the Belovezh Accord. At the time, Fedorov claimed that the group was now drawing up a joint economic and political platform to be released. At the start of March, after three-party negotiations had stalled, Lebed and Fyodorov proceeded without Yavlinsky with a tentative agreement to work alongside Alexander Rutskoy and Stanislav Govorukhin to form a third force coalition. Zyuganov, unsuccessfully, tried to convince these parties to support his campaign. While Zyuganov failed to persuade either Lebed or Fyodorov to support him, he did manage to successfully entice Rutskoy and Govorukhin into throwing their support behind his candidacy, quickly eliminating their involvement with third-force efforts.The 1996 Russian presidential election / Jerry F. Hough, Evelyn Davidheiser, Susan Goodrich Lehmann. Brookings occasional papers. Upon entering the race in early March, Mikhail Gorbechev proclaimed that, despite polls showing he had immense unpopularity, he would be able to win as the leader of a democratic coalition.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/03/02/gorbachev- to-run-for-president/2d7bb9d5-bd9b-4977-b251-0d4527963476/ He called for all democratic forces to unite and form a wide coalition, and indicated his readiness to lead such a group. He claimed that there would be immense consequences for an election that merely presented the, \\"false choice\\" between Yeltsin and Communists. Gorbachev declared, \\"What they are offering is not a democratic future for Russia. That is why we must unite.\\" However, a spokesperson for Yavlinsky indicated that with Gorbachev's unpopularity, such a coalition was, \\"not very realistic\\". Nevertheless, later in March, after announcing that he had collected the required signatures to officially register as a candidate, Gorbachev reiterated the need for voters to have a third option to serve as an alternative to Yeltsin and Zyuganov, and refused to rule-out forming a coalition with Fydorov or Yavilinsky. Spring 1996 In mid-March, Yavlinsky declared that he would agree to withdraw his candidacy if another qualified and viable candidate entered the race. He mentioned Boris Nemtsov, who had already declined to run, as one individual that he would be willing step aside for. By April 1996, opinion polls had placed Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov ahead of the rest of the candidates running, essentially making the election a two-person race. However, between one third and half of the electorate still intended to vote for a candidate other than Yeltsin and Zyuganov, which indicated that a third-force coalition remained viable. At the end of April, Gorbachev claimed that he had held talks with the \\"Third Force Group\\", and he would be willing to step-aside for a stronger candidate. However, others did not actively negotiate with him to join the proposed third-force coalition. =Death of negotiations= Throughout the spring, it had appeared to many observers that Yavlinsky and Lebed had been nearing an arrangement. Yabloko had even begun assisting Lebed in collecting signatures for his candidacy. Yavilinsky and Lebed held periodic meetings (the two met far more frequently with each other than they did with Fyodorov). However, in May, the loose coalition between them abruptly fell apart. Unbeknownst to others, Yeltsin and Lebed met in April and reached a secret agreement. They reached a tentative understanding in which Lebed would support Yeltsin in the second round. Yeltsin believed that by building-up Lebed's candidacy, he would narrow the vote to the benefit of his own campaign. He also believed that it would help pave the way for an anti-communist alliance in the second round of the election. Media oligarch and Yeltsin-ally Berezovsky subsequently worked to provide favorable coverage of Lebed in order to build-up his candidacy. However, Lebed continued to engage in third force coalitions, partially to prevent a different third-force coalition from being pursued. Lebed would later feel betrayed when he learned that Yavilinsky had held talks with Yeltsin as well. However, Yavilinsky's had been unproductive. Ultimately, with Lebed withdrawing from negotiations with Yavilynsky, all prospects of the third force coalition were ended, as a coalition between Fyodorov and Yavlinsky was deemed to be insufficient without the involvement of Lebed.

She has also taught at a summer seminar on utilitarian ethics at the European Graduate School and Spring School for PhD students at the Dutch Research School of Philosophy. She is best known for her collaborations with the Australian philosopher Peter Singer. In their 2012, 2014 and 2016 collaborations she and Singer set out to explain and defend act utilitarianism and suggest a resolution to what the late 19th century British philosopher Henry Sidgwick called ‚Äúthe profoundest problem of ethics‚Äù, the apparent rationality of both ethical egoism and utilitarianism. She and Singer use an evolutionary debunking argument to damage egoism but leave utilitarianism unscathed. In On What Matters Vol 3. Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit (1942‚Äì2017) expressed the view that their argument against the rationality of egoism carried \\"some force\\" though, as Lazari-Radek and Singer themselves acknowledge, it is not \\"decisive\\". Utilitarianism In his review of Lazari-Radek and Singer‚Äôs book, The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics (2014), philosopher Bart Schultz, director of the Civic Knowledge Project at the University of Chicago, describes de Lazari- Radek as ‚Äúa rising star ‚Ä¶ of philosophical utilitarianism‚Äù, stating that their ‚Äúbook might well represent the most significant statement and defense of act utilitarianism since the 19th century, when the classical utilitarianism of Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick were the spirit of the age.‚Äù De Lazari-Radek defends a form of act utilitarianism similar to that of Sidgwick whose work was the focus of her doctoral dissertation entitled ‚ÄúGood and Reason in the Moral Philosophy of Henry Sidgwick (2007).‚Äù De Lazari-Radek also draws insights from more contemporary thinkers like Parfit who classified her and Singer‚Äôs view that we have most reason to do whatever would be impartially best as a form of \\"Rational Impartialism\\". In July 2017 her and Singer‚Äôs second book was published Utilitarianism: A Very Short Introduction, of which Jeff McMahan, White's Professor of Moral Philosophy, Oxford University, has said: \\"Written with characteristic clarity by the acknowledged heirs of the founders of utilitarianism, this discussion is authoritative, sympathetic though not uncritical, and remarkably comprehensive - in a word, ideal.\\" Hedonism De Lazari-Radek explains her normative position as a hedonistic utilitarian. She persuaded Singer to embrace hedonism instead of preference utilitarianism during their collaboration on The Point of View of the Universe. She is exploring the matter more carefully in her two upcoming books on well-being and pleasure in Polish and English. Biographical notes De Lazari-Radek lives and works in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. She is married and has two children. Apart from being a philosopher she is an enthusiastic jogger and gardener.

It was selected as the Estonian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Plot In 19th century Estonia, a mythical village is inhabited by personified Black Death, spirits, werewolves and the devil himself. The film opens with a supernaturally-powered automaton called a kratt stealing a cow. It drags the cow by its chains and lifts it up in the air, depositing it at the farm of its master, the villager called Raak. Fashioned out of odds, ends, and farm tools, kratts need to be imbued with a soul in order to do their masters' bidding: primarily stealing livestock from other villagers, aside from menial farm labor. Villagers whistle for the devil at a crossroads in order to arrange a deal: their human soul, to buy a soul for their kratt. However, wily villagers such as Raak continually trick the devil by using the sap of three black currants in lieu of blood to sign the devil's contract. The villagers are driven by a need to survive the harsh winter, and resort to all manner of thievery and deceit to accomplish their ends. They steal from one another, and trade their souls for the kratt in order to keep their souls from being stolen, too. They even fool the Plague - first disguised as a blanched young woman crossing the river, then later as a white goat - by wearing pants over their heads to make it think they have two asses, and thus leave them alone. But the Plague cannot be fooled twice, and when it finally assumes a pig form, the village elder makes a pact with the Plague: if it has to kill, then it must leave a young boy and a young girl alive so that the race can go on. The young girl and the young boy are the main characters, Liina and Hans. Liina is Raak's daughter: a headstrong young woman whom her penurious father has arranged, in a drunken pub session, to be married to an older, piggish farmer named Endel. But she longs for the local village boy, Hans. He, in turn, is besotted with a young Baroness - the visiting daughter of the local German baron, whom the local Estonians secretly resent, and get their revenge on by stealing food and valuable objects from the estate. The Baroness is afflicted with somnambulism, and must often be guarded so she does not sleepwalk off the manor roof, which she almost does several times. Hans and Liina try to use mystical powers so that their unrequited love could change into requited love. Liina can transform into a werewolf, and watches Hans as he stares at the Baroness' window at night. Seeing how smitten Hans is with the Baroness, Liina consults the local witch, Minna, who gives her an arrow and tells her to fling it at the Baroness when she looks out her window, saying that the arrow will split the Baroness' skull and spill her brains out. Liina stands watch at the manor one night, and sees the Baroness atop the manor, sleepwalking. She cannot bring herself to kill the Baroness, however; Liina materializes atop the manor and pulls the Baroness back from the edge. Hans, meanwhile, fashions a kratt out of a snowman and tries to trick the devil with the three black currants. But the devil has wised up to the ruse and forces Hans into trading his own soul in order that his kratt may be imbued with one. Hans tries to use the kratt to bring him the Baroness; however, the kratt sadly replies that it cannot steal humans, only livestock and inanimate things. Hans then consults his kratt about love and romance; the kratt, made out of snow made out of water that has seen many things, enchants Hans with tales of romances it has witnessed through millennia. The witch Minna asks why Liina didn't kill the Baroness; she replies that Hans loves the Baroness, and that he might die of sadness if she died. The witch is revealed to be an old spurned love of Raak, who in spite cast a spell that killed his wife and Liina's mother. But in a rare spirit of forgiveness, Minna confides to Raak her concern over Liina's unrequited feelings. In a last effort to enchant Hans, the witch asks Raak to ask Liina if she can procure a dress the baroness might wear. Luise, the baron's housekeeper, who has been pilfering the old Baroness' garments and other belongings, trades in the old Baroness' last gown for a silver brooch that Liina's forebears had been safeguarding as part of the Raak family treasure. That night, Hans and Liina encounter each other in a dreamlike state in the forest. Liina wears the old Baroness' gown with a veil over her head. Hans does not seem to recognize Liina. He introduces himself and falls to his knees, thinking she is the young Baroness. Raal watches the two from a distance, saying to himself \\"Two fools\\" before walking away. The pair kneel in silence through the rainy night, and when morning comes, Hans finally kisses Liina through her veil. Ecstatic, Liina walks away, and Hans asks his melting kratt one final question. The kratt replies \\"That girl loves you\\" before dissolving into a muddy puddle. Hans then finds an expensive ring in the slush - one that had figured in a romantic tale in Venice that the kratt had relayed to Hans via the snowman's liquid memories. Hans chases after Liina - still thinking she is the Baroness - to propose. Meanwhile, the actual Baroness is shown to have finally sleepwalked off the manor roof the previous night, and died. Liina hears Hans' wagon approaching and removes her veil in happy anticipation. However, the devil appears on Hans' cart, and asks where his kratt is. When Hans replies that it had melted, the devil says \\"Then it's time to pay!\\", then snaps Hans' neck. Liina chases after the wagon bearing Hans' dead body, as it encounters the funeral procession for the dead young Baroness. Hans' father, Sander, berates his own kratt while they prepare Hans' body for burial, saying the kratts are burdens on humanity who won't hesitate to cut human throats. The kratt retorts by asking who told humans to make deals with the devil, and chides the father why humans fool the plague and the devil, but don't want to pay with their souls as promised. Sander then replies \\"But I have no soul.\\" After Hans' burial, Liina walks into a nearby river and drowns herself. Underneath the waters, her body slips from the Baroness' gown as she encounters Hans and kisses him one last time. Later, two villagers are then shown discovering solid gold pieces in the river. They declare it the buried Raak treasure before one of them lifts up Liina's body. They take the gold pieces but leave a gold necklace for Liina's corpse, saying it will make a nice dowry for a virgin bride. Liina's corpse then replies \\"Oh, yes. Just what a virgin bride dreams of.\\" Cast * Rea Lest-Liik as Liina * J√∂rgen Liik as Hans * as Rein * Heino Kalm as Sander * as Jaan * Katariina Unt as Luise * Taavi Eelmaa as Ints * Dieter Laser as Baron * Jette Loona Hermanis as Baroness Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96%, based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.17/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, described November as a \\"marvelously strange film\\" and a \\"midnight-movie classic in the making,\\" awarding it 3.5 stars out of 4. Sheri Linden's review for the Los Angeles Times was equally positive, referring to November as an \\"earthbound fairy tale\\" that \\"occupies a dreamscape somewhere between the teeming canvases of Brueghel and the existential agonies of Bela Tarr‚Äôs films.\\" Much of the critical praise focused on the cinematography, with NPR's Mark Jenkins calling it \\"bewitching\\" while criticizing the plot as \\"slight.\\" Despite being selected as the Estonian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, November was not picked for nomination. However, the film did win a number of accolades, including the Spotlight Award by the American Society of Cinematographers, the International Fantasy Film Award at Fantasporto, Best Cinematography in an International Narrative Feature at Tribeca Film Festival, Best Film and Best Cinematography at Listapad, and Best Estonian Film at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival.

He has been described as \\"the pioneer who brought quantitative genetic analysis to the study of behavior.\\" Biography He was born on September 20, 1922 in Manhattan, New York City. Hirsch began his interest in behavior genetics in the 1950s, as a student at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied under Edward C. Tolman and Robert Tryon. From 1956 to 1960, he was an assistant professor at Columbia University, where he worked alongside Theodosius Dobzhansky. He later conducted multiple influential studies on the genetic origins of behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster, Dobzhansky's favorite species. He subsequently continued this research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he became an associate professor of psychology and zoology in 1960. He became a full professor of psychology there in 1963, of zoology in 1966, and of ecology, ethology, and evolution in 1976. On March 30, 1970, he hosted the founding meeting of the Behavior Genetics Association at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was the editor-in-chief of Animal Behaviour from 1968 to 1972 and of the Journal of Comparative Psychology from 1983 to 1988. He retired from the University of Illinois in 1993, and remained an active emeritus professor there until 2004. He died on May 3, 2008 at his home in Urbana, Illinois. Criticism of hereditarians Hirsch was an early and vocal critic of the work of Arthur Jensen, who argued that group differences in educational ability were heritable. Hirsch argued that Jensen's work was a misuse and misrepresentation of behavior genetics and that Jensen's \\"avowed goals\\" were \\"as heinously barbaric as were Hitler's and the anti- abolitionists\\". In the mid-1960s, William Shockley tried to convince Hirsch to support his views on the heritability of racial differences in IQ. This attempt was unsuccessful, and Hirsch subsequently called the nature-nurture debate a \\"pseudo-question\\".

The IASO has five regional offices: Gothenburg, Sweden; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Montreal, Canada; Orlando, Florida; and Cairo, Egypt.  Objectives  The IASO strives to advance common industry practices, solve challenges, and improve collaboration and mutual understanding between key decision-makers, providers, and other regulators of the aviation services industry. Its goal is to create strong industry representation worldwide and shed light on the benefits of aviation to both national and worldwide economies. The IASO provides an online database and registry for auditing and measuring key risk factors. This database allows IASO members to meet international safety standards established by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) under its IATA Safety Audit program for Ground Operations (ISAGO). The IASO‚Äôs objective is to partner with the IATA, assisting it and other international organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), in meeting their international safety mandates.  Constituent Organizations  The IASO contains two sub-organizations: the International Fuel Services Organization (IFSO) and the International Handling Aviation Organization (IHAO). The IHAO acts as a forum for debating the common issues concerning ground operations, and it seeks to improve ground-handling standards globally. IHAO's office is registered in Sweden, but it is headquartered in Dubai. The International Fuel Service Organization (IFSO) is a global association established to represent leading fuel suppliers in the aviation sphere, improving their overall ground performance.  Board of Directors  The organization‚Äôs board of directors consists of ten members, including Chairman Munir Kahlifeh and Samir H. Al Asadi. Munir Kahlifeh, the IASO founder, previously contributed to the establishment of Al Shamelah Aviation Services in 2011. He also started its sister company Mixjet AB, which oversees the European market and constituent airlines, in 2012 in Sweden. Samir H. Al Alsadi, Co-Founder of the IASO, is Executive Director of Mixjet AB Sweden. He was previously Executive Director of Letsfly's Sweden and France divisions. Other Directors include Adel Mardini, CEO and President of (Jetex Flight Support); Mohammed Al Husary, Executive President and Co-Founder of (UAS International Trip Support); Omar Hosari, (UAS International Trip Support) Co- Founder and Chief Executive Officer; Roy D Barnett; Capt. Samir Sajet; Chamsou Andjorin; Juan Carlos Lozano Pacios; and Mohamed Elamiri.  Membership  IASO members are granted access to a list of revenue-enhancing benefits, including: * IASO‚Äôs Aviation Ground Services Assessment (IAGSA) * Access to discounted insurance * Arbitration and dispute resolution * Risk assessment database * Business networking Smaller industry-supply businesses who become IASO members have access to the organization's resources, such as a ground damage reporting tool, audit support, and help gauging fuel-price efficiency. Current members include the UAS International Trip Support, Jetex Flight Support, Nobles Jet, Mixjet Flight Support, and the Middle East Business Aviation (MEBA).

Biography NIcolas W√∂hrl was born in Recklinghausen, Germany the son of Thomas W√∂hrl, a geophysicist and Magdalene W√∂hrl, a magistrate. Academic career W√∂hrl attended Gelsenkirchen Grundschule, Realschule until June 1993. After completing his civilian service, he studied physics at the University of Duisburg-Essen. He graduated as a physics engineer in September 1999. His dissertation was titled \\"Improving the Biocompatibility of Stents by Carbon Based Layers\\". In May 2003, he completed a master's thesis on the production of hard carbon layers. From July 2003 to April 2007, W√∂hrl worked as a research assistant in technical physics at Volker Buck. He worked on the topic \\"Deposition and Characterization of Nanocrystalline Diamond Layers\\", conducted physical internships for physicians, and supervised graduate students. From May 2007 to October 2009, he worked at IPLAS GmbH Troisdorf as a senior scientist in the research and development department. He worked on process development for the Plasma CVD, the homoepitactic carbon layers, and building a production line. In April 2010, he received the title Doctor of Natural Sciences. From November 2009 to February 2013, W√∂hrl again worked as a research assistant at Volker Buck at the Center for Nanointegration Duisburg- Essen at the University of Duisburg-Essen. From March 2013 to January 2016, he was a research associate in the Inorganic Chemistry department of the University of Duisburg-Essen with Stephan Schulz. Since 2013 he has been the spokesperson for the Young Researcher Network (YRN) at the University of Duisburg-Essen. In February 2016 he began working in experimental physics at the University of Duisburg-Essen with professor Axel Lorke. Research W√∂hrl's specialty is the synthesis and characterization (nano) of structured carbon layers. His work on nanotechnologyat the University of Duisburg-Essen is integrated into the Center for Nanointegration University-Duisburg (CENIDE). Its range extends from crystalline structures (diamond - single crystals, nanocrystalline diamond layers) through low-dimensional structures (graphene, carbon nanowalls) to amorphous carbon layers (aC, aC: H). For the synthesis of these structures, both PVD and plasma-assisted CVD methods are used. The plant concepts used include microwaves, radio frequency (RF), and various arc processes. With these systems and methods, W√∂hrl has made important contributions to the development and modelling of synthetic processes for these materials. Among other things, he realized one of the first depositions of grapheme of the direct plasma method in Germany. In his doctoral thesis, he dealt with the production of nanocrystalline and ultrananocrystalline diamond layers with specific properties, demonstrating the role of the amorphous carbon matrix in these layers on many material properties. In the field of single-crystal diamond layers, W√∂hrl investigates the formation and properties of near-surface spin centers in high-purity diamond. He investigates the influence of structure and termination of the surface on the underlying spin centers and their properties. In 2016 he worked on the miniaturization of conventional fuel cell concepts by maximizing electrochemical active surface by using carbon nanowalls. By using innovative plasma processes and catalyst or electrolyte materials, the electrode n of the micro fuel cells' electrochemical performance was specifically improved. In addition to material synthesis, surface modifications by plasma processes and the characterization of these plasmas also belong to his field of activity with different methods such as optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Science communication and podcast Methodically Incorrect! In addition to his work at the university, W√∂hrl is involved in various areas of scientific communication. He appears as an expert on television programs such as 1, 2 or 3,) Galileo, and on the Livestream channel of Rocket Beans TV. On various occasions, he has participated in popular science lectures and science slams. W√∂hrl has been working together with his colleague Reinhard Remfort on podcasts since May 8, 2013. In January 2017, they were attracting approximately 70,000 downloads per episode. Since 2014, there have been some podcasts of the podcast, including an evening event at the Chaos Communication Congress. W√∂hrl is co-founder of the curated directory of knowledge podcasts Wissenschaftspodcasts, which aims to strengthen the potential of podcasts for knowledge transfer.

Born in Calcutta to a French mother and a British father, she moved to London to train as a nurse but did not have much enthusiasm about her career and began working as a researcher for Granada Television in 1965. Kewley had her first foreign assignment in 1969 and continued to be sent abroad for assignments and interviewed major world figures of the period. She moved to working on the ITV current affairs series This Week in 1972 and made several documentaries for the programme. Kewley won her first award for a documentary about the South Korean human rights situations in 1977. She began planning Tibet: A Case to Answer in 1985 and the project was approved by Channel 4's commissioning editor David Lloyd. Kewley entered the country via a tourist group and initially shared amateur filming equipment with the cinematographer Sean Bobbitt before he became ill. She returned to Tibet three years later to film a follow-up but stopped film making after being diagnosed with parkinson's disease in 1993. Kewley however returned to nursing and worked for the Red Cross in Bosnia and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Biography Early life Kewley was born on 8 November 1937 in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India. She was the daughter of a French mother and her British-born father Coleman Kewley was a diplomat. Kewley was handed her father's enthusiasm for studying comparative Asian religions and the Sanskrit language. She was educated in India, France and Switzerland primarily in Roman Catholic schools. Kewley read philosophy and history at the Sorbonne which was the historical house of the University of Paris. She left before her first year was completed and instead moved to London to train as a registered nurse, working at the Charing Cross Hospital's casualty department. Career Having not much content with nursing, Kewley started to write for the local London newspapers in her spare time before becoming ambitious over journalism on television. She later said of the start of her career, \\"I began knocking on every studio door I could find until someone asked me inside.\\" Kewley joined Granada Television in 1965 as a researcher for the regional news programme, Scene at 6.30. She later became a producer and director on the current affairs programme World in Action between 1968 and 1971. In 1969, during her first foreign assignment and living without permission amongst \\"freedom fighters\\" Kewley was captured and beaten by soldiers while making a film about the problem of genocide in South Sudan. She narrowly avoided being raped by her captors. Kewley took a film crew into Nigeria in 1970 when the country was under civil war and secured an exclusive interview with the Biafran forces leader C. Odumegwu Ojukwu that same year. She filmed Bangladesh freedom fighters in East Pakistan in 1971. Kewley switched to the ITV current affairs series This Week in 1972 and made several documentaries for the programme. This included an assignment to Vietnam during the war there where she contracted infective hepatitis and liver abscesses while filming in the country's jungle war areas and evaded fire from Vietcong forces. Kewley also made programmes about the 1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum and a fourteen-year-old boy imprisoned in Turkey on drug charges. That same year she became engaged to the journalist Richard Lindley but the marriage was later called off. Kewley interviewed the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet the 14th Dalai Lama at his home in the Himalayas for the 1975 film The Lama King and this formed a lifelong friendship. She had a spell with the BBC and partook in the religious and ethics series Anno Domini between 1975 and 1977 and Everyman from 1977 to 1978. She also interviewed the leader of Libya Muammar Gaddafi in the film Soldier for Islam in 1976 (updated two years later). That same year, she revealed through her documentary Paradise Lost the widespread use of torture in Paraguay. She won her first prize at the Montreux Festival in 1977 for a documentary about the human rights situation in South Korea filmed two years earlier. The following year, Kewley was awarded the BBC Director General‚Äôs Award for Special Services to Television. She documented the resurgence of Islam in Saudi Arabia in 1979 in an ITV film called The Year of the Prophet and calculated what economic and political implications this would have for the Western world. Kewley investigated the issue of physical abuse of babies in the United Kingdom in the 1980 film Rosie's Story. Tibet: A Case to Answer In 1985, Kewley was disturbed over the human rights situation in Tibet and started to establish contacts in the country. She persuaded Channel 4's commissioning editor David Lloyd to fund the channel's most expensive documentary at the time, for the current affairs series Dispatches. Kewley entered Tibet with a guided tourist group and then deserted. She shared amateur filming equipment with the American cinematographer Sean Bobbitt but her plans were disintegrating after entering China on a three-month tourist visa as transport links were cancelled. Kewley joined Bobbitt in Chengdu as part of group touring the Tibetan capital Lhasa for five days and discovered that natives were outnumbered by Chinese citizens in their own country. Following more delays, she replaced her translator since she was concerned that he might be a collaborator and filmed interviews that divulged the human rights abuses by the ruling Chinese authorities. Kewley filmed alone when Bobbitt left after becoming ill and continued her journey by van into the region's interior and discovered babies being born with deformities near a nuclear plant with one Chinese doctor admitting to performing enforced abortions and sterilisations. She persuaded a French mountaineer to smuggle the majority of the film footage out of Tibet before leaving on her own flight. The resulting film, Tibet: A Case to Answer, received much attention after its first broadcast on Channel 4 in 1988 and was repeated twice more in the following months. It was also specially shown to members of the Houses of Parliament, the United States Congress and the European Parliament. The film drew repeated protests from Beijing and Chinese ambassadors declined offers to debate the film live on air with Kewley. She also courted controversy by interviewing her subjects without disguises but she responded that she attempted to persuade the interviewees to hide their identifies but they chose not to. The 14th Dalai Lama became a friend as \\"she continued to travel once a year to India and Dharamsala ‚Äì home in exile of the Dalai Lama, who was the subject of her 1975 film, The Lama King.\\" Later life and death In 1990, Kewley's only book entitled Tibet: Behind the Ice Curtain was published. She returned to Tibet in 1991 by smuggling herself into the country across the Himalayas hidden beneath the floorboards of a van to create the follow-up to Tibet: A Case to Answer, entitled Voices from Tibet shown on Channel 4. Kewley revealed martial law was still present in Tibet despite claims from China that it had been ended. She stopped producing documentaries when she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1993. However Kewley returned to Charing Cross Hospital in the early 1990s to undertake a refresher course before travelling to perform work for the Red Cross in Bosnia and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. She adopted and sponsored the education of two girls from Tibet and one boy from Rwanda. On 14 October 2000, Kewley married the soil scientist Michael Lambert and the marriage ended with Lambert's death from bone cancer four years later. She died of pneumonia and Parkinson's disease on 17 July 2012 at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Her adoptive children survive her.

The ways in which data is collected, accessed, and what we do with that data has changed in contemporary society due to a number of factors surrounding issues of politics. An issue that arises from political data is often how disconnected people are from their own data, rarely gaining access to the data they produce. Large platforms like Google have a \\"better to ask forgiveness than permission\\" stance on data collection to which the greater population is largely ignorant, leading to movements within data activism. History Data collection has had a long history, but the way humans are involved in its collection has grown exponentially in the years since the dot-com boom of the 1990s and the market crash in 2008. The primary goal of platforms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon is data collection through the applications and services they provide to consumers, such as wearable technology like FitBit and Apple Watch, as well as home devices like Google Nest and Amazon Alexa. The purpose of these devices becomes more clear when consumers understand the immense amounts of data that are being exhausted and sold to advertisers and data brokers Some scholars note the resemblance of platforms to sovereign states with their power and populations, as well as their surveillance capabilities. More recently, data collection has been seen as a trade off, privacy is disregarded and in return, consumers gain access to convenient applications and devices to stay connected. Open government data The principles behind open government data are data that are free to use without restrictions, available for reuse, unlicensed and non-discriminatory Other academics feel open government data should be focused on servicing citizens needs, rather than just providing them with raw data. This process would require training individuals to analyze data while also including them in the management and planning of data. Having access to government schedules does little for public engagement, but creating plans surrounding public issues, such as health and wellness, and making that data available may have positive impact on citizens lives. This type of practice has been called open innovation, which focuses on the collaborative aspects of open government. Speaking to the idea of open innovation, it has been said that although there should be no restriction on data availability, the focus on data for public policy and commercial use should be most important such as economic and transportation data. Open data initiatives In 2011 the Open Government Partnership was created requiring governments globally to adhere to standards relating to open government, including transparency, anti-corruption and promote technological innovation, and has been adopted by 72 countries, with more considered as eligible partners. Other efforts include the Global Open Data Index (GODI), a crowdsourced index that scores and evaluates the openness of government data from a civic perspective. GODI tries to answer the question of how government's publish data and thus far does not assess the quality of data published. Data activism The mass scale of data collection has created an asymmetrical power dynamic between state and citizens, some scholars say. Data politics is similar but different from data activism, focusing on civic data and making the government process of outputting data better. There are multiple levels to data politics although two standout at the grassroots level, the protest of mass data collection and engagement with data. On a wider scale, the two approaches to data activism and data politics are called reactive, where large scale data collection threatens the freedoms and privacy of a society, and proactive, where open data and open government can illicit greater societal change, proactive activists are advocates of both open data and government and question the reality we live in. Data Politics shares traits of each approach in that the core values of data politics are open government data, but data politics also concerns data collection by governments, private corporations, and platforms. An example of a realm where data politics proactive was the protest of the elimination of the long form census. In Canada there are efforts like datalibre.ca, who advocate for the restoration of the long form census by creating a database of Canadian institutions that support and are against the cancellation of the census. This blog is proactive in its belief that publicly funded data should be open and free of charge to be used for positive social change See also * Data activism * Open government * Politics * Open data References Data ","title":"Data politics"},{"id":"55169275","text":"Mangelia limata is an extinct species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae.https://archive.org/details/bulletinso93739192122corn Bulletins of American Paleontology 9.37 (1922) Description The length of the shell attains 9 mm, its diameter 3.5 mm.

The organisation operates globally with the mission to disrupt and help dismantle organised transnational criminal networks trading in wildlife, timber and fish. The WJC collects evidence with the aim of turning it into accountability. __TOC__ Investigations and scope of work The WJC undertakes undercover, intelligence-driven investigations, based on law enforcement methodology, with a goal of presenting verifiable, first-hand evidence of wildlife crimes in case files or intelligence reports to national governments and law enforcement agencies for action. The WJC identifies high- level trafficking suspects through intelligence analysis; publishes briefings and reports to help build a broader knowledge base; and shares intelligence with governments, to enable more effective enforcement against wildlife trafficking. The WJC‚Äôs goal is to encourage and support law enforcement action in arresting and successfully prosecuting high-level traffickers as well as disrupting their criminal networks. The organisation offers operational support but also creates diplomatic pressure on those governments that are unwilling to act on the evidence, holding a public hearing in front of recognised experts as a last resort. The WJC works with law enforcement, policymakers, intergovernmental organisations and non-governmental entities to advance the cause of wildlife justice and over the longer-term help create sustainable solutions. Achievements Since 2015, the WJC has conducted 24 wildlife crime investigations in 24 Asian and African countries across the supply chain, including source, transit and destination. As a result of its operations, and in co-operation with Malaysian, Indian and Vietnamese police and wildlife authorities, 70 traffickers have been arrested and 10 major trafficking networks involved in the supply of ivory, rhino horn, turtles and tortoises and tigers have been disrupted. These law enforcement efforts have led to 18 convictions, with a further 28 cases pending in court. In 2017, as a direct outcome of WJC operations, 25 high-level traffickers were arrested, a further 88 traffickers were identified, and nine trafficking bank accounts confirmed. All WJC‚Äôs research data, some from investigations that took more than two years to complete, was delivered to governments or law enforcement authorities in India, Malaysia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Mozambique, China and Bangladesh. In that year, the WJC also produced two substantial Case Files, for the governments of Viet Nam, Lao PDR and China, identifying the trafficking of over USD 30 million in ivory, rhino horn and tiger body parts such as skin, claws, teeth canines, whiskers and bones. Partnerships and collaborations The WJC works in partnership and develops agreements with stakeholders from different fields with the aim of achieving the biggest impact against wildlife trafficking and the criminal networks that perpetuate it. The WJC has signed collaboration agreements with Europol, the National Whistleblower Center, and the Strathmore University of Kenya. The organisation is also part of Plant.ID, an EU-funded project aimed at identifying ebony species used in acoustic string instruments to distinguish illegally traded from legally traded wood. Funding The WJC funding comes primarily from lotteries, foundation grants and individual donations. Publications All publications issued by the WJC are available at the organisation‚Äôs website.

This was seven years after the Lourdes apparitions. Ilaƒça became the most important Catholic pilgrimage site in the historical region of Syrmia. Initially, church authorities tried to prevent congregations from pilgrimage. Later, it was permitted by bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer. In 1865, a shepherd from Ilaƒça, Petar Lazin, claimed seeing water on the middle of the field road although no rain had fallen, and that once he made a hole, water started flowing and continued thereafter. On the same night, another villager, ƒêuka Ambru≈°eviƒá saw the Virgin Mary with a child. In his dream, she told him that it was her spring, and that he must build a wall around it so that livestock could not drink from it. When he woke up, he saw the image from his dream next to his bed. In 1866, a small chapel was built next to the spring, and in 1870 construction of a church began. Ilaƒça became the target of pilgrimage for Roman Catholic Croats, Germans, Hungarians as well as for Eastern-rite Catholic Pannonian Rusyns. During the Croatian War of Independence, the church was destroyed by tanks of the Yugoslav People's Army active in the area of self-proclaimed Serbian Autonomous Oblast of SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. Once the UNTAES finished its peace mission in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia in 1998, pilgrimage resumed. A documentary about Ilaƒça pilgrimage was recorded in 2010.

They have strong sociocultural connections with their neighbours, the Burarra, on the Australian mainland. Name The Yan-nha≈ãu people derive their ethnonym from the language they spoke, y√§n meaning 'tongue/speech' and nha≈ãu a proximate deictic word signifying 'this'. Language Yan-nhangu is a member of the Yol≈ãu language family. Country In his classic survey of Australian tribes, Norman Tindale assigned their modern territory to the Djinang people. He writes that the Yan-nha≈ãu (Nango) were indigenous to the Wessel Islands east of Brown Strait (from Jirrgari island to Cape Wessel), Galiwin'ku/Elcho Island and Drysdale Island. Their territory also encompassed the Cunningham Islands. With regard to the Crocodile Islands group, Tindale designated Mooroonga and Yabooma as Yan- nha≈ãu, adding that they were also present at Banyan Island, where the Woolen River debouches. Traditional social organization The Yan-nha≈ãu were formed of eight clans, belonging to either a Dua or Yirritja moiety:- Dua moieties (5 clans) * 1. Bararparar. (Bararrpararr) * 2. Bararngu (Bararrngu, Barangu, Perango) * 3. Jan:angu. * 4. Guri:ndi (Gurryindi) * 5. Gamalangga. (Garmalangga, Karmalanga, Kokolango, Kokolangomala) Yirritja moieties. (3 clans) * 6. Golpa. (Kolpa, Golbu, Golba, Gorlba) * 7. Jalukal. (Yalukal, Jalugal) * 8. Walamangu. (Wolamangu, Wallamungo) History In 1921, Elcho Island was chosen as the site for a Methodist Overseas Mission. However, oil drilling by the Naphtha Petroleum Company brought about the closure of the proposed mission site, which therefore was relocated to Milingimbi. This mission was established by James Watson in 1922, after that religious organisation had obtained a lease on the site in 1921. Following this twofold usurpation of their key homeland isles, the Yan-nha≈ãu then found Milingimbi subject to an influx of other Yol≈ãu peoples from the mainland, who were drawn to the Mission. Inter-clan fighting erupted, and many Yan-nha≈ãu shifted to the less accessible island of Murrungga. Ethnography The Yan-nhangu were something of an anomaly in the ethnographic literature. They were described as extinct, and there was little mention of them, even down to as late as the 1980s. The visiting American anthropologist W. Lloyd Warner visited the Crocodile island group on two occasions in 1927 and 1928, as did others such as Donald Thompson in the 1930s. In the early 1990s a young anthropologist, conversing in Djambarrpuy≈ãu with an elderly woman, Laurie Baymarrwangga, on a beach on the island of Murru≈ãga, discovered that she was still fluent in a language that had been barely recorded, apart from a minimal glossary of some 300 words Working together they recorded over the following decades a lexicon with over 4,000 words and a descriptive grammar of the language, together with a detailed mapping of their ecological and cosmological lore.

Friday, February 12, 1937; Page: 10 Forbes Bank crashed spectacularly in 1843 resulting in hardship, unemployment, bankruptcy and destitution for many of the inhabitants of the Island. History Origins The early history of banking on the Isle of Man is rife with incompetence and mismanagement. Whilst the earliest banks in England were an integral part in trading as far back as the 12th Century, banking was unknown on the Isle of Man until the beginning of the 19th Century. The earliest Manx bank began business in 1802 at Castletown. It was known as the Isle of Man Bank and carried on trading until 1818.Isle of Man Daily Times. Tuesday, January 17, 1961; Page: 3 A feature of Manx life at that time was a profusion of bank notes in circulation issued by tradesmen for small amounts and an Act to control note issues was passed in 1817. Five bank licences were issued under this law. The archives deposited in the Rolls Office reveal the fact that in 1817 five banks were authorised to transact banking business and issue notes in the Island, among them being John and Alexander Spittall, Gawne and McWhannell, Forbes Bank, and the better known Holmes' Bank. Formation and operation Forbes Bank was established from the banking firm of Wulff and Forbes and opened in 1826. The bank's premises were situated on the site of where Douglas Railway Station now stands. In 1827 the bank was converted into the Isle of Man Joint Stock Banking Company which had a capital of ¬£50,000 in ¬£5 shares. A bonus of ¬£2,500 was given for the transfer with Edward Forbes appointed as manager. Whether Forbes Bank was solvent at the time of its conversion into the Joint Stock Banking Company is a matter of conjecture. Failure The undertaking ended disastrously in 1843. The cause was an extensive defalcation by a manager, whose method was the circulation of fraudulent bills. A bitter controversy on the management and the method of liquidation is reflected in the newspapers of the time. At the failure, the Bank was liable on notes ¬£14,000; unpaid drafts, ¬£6000; and deposits, ¬£45,000. Its advances were ¬£62,000, and securities lodged against notes ¬£15,000. Its greatest indebtedness seems to have been to its London agents, some ¬£70,000 to ¬£80,000. Aftermath The failure of Forbes Bank caused acute misery and suffering on the Isle of Man.

Socio-economic context  In 2012, Benin relied on raw commodities for most of its export revenue. Its three main export products were cotton (19% of exports), petroleum oils or bituminous minerals (14%) and gold (13%). Agriculture accounted for 37% of GDP, the services sector for 50% of GDP and industry for 14%. Within industry, manufacturing contributed 8% of GDP. By increasing diversity in its economy, Benin would reduce its reliance on fluctuating global market prices for commodities and create jobs for its rapidly growing population (2.64% per year in 2014). According to the World Bank, 'despite moderate GDP growth of between 4% and 5% annually over the past two decades, poverty remains widespread and on the rise in Benin, with national poverty rates of 37.5% in 2006, 35.2% in 2009, 36.2% in 2011 and 40.1% in 2015'. Benin is a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In 2014, Benin ranked 18th on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance. In 2011, 57% of the population had access to clean water but only 5% to improved sanitation. One in four 28%) people had access to electricity and one in twenty (5%) had access to Internet.  Education  The average enrollment rate in primary education rose from 88% to 93% in West Africa between 2004 and 2012. According to the ECOWAS Annual Report (2012), enrollment has increased by as much as 20% since 2004 in four countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Niger. In 2010, Benin devoted 5.3% of GDP to education, 15.6% of which went to higher education (0.8% of GDP). By 2012, Benin had achieved universal primary education and half of children attended secondary school (54.2%). There was also a relatively high enrollment rate in tertiary education (12.4%), which was comparable with the rate in Ghana (12.2%) and second only to the subregional leader for this indicator, Cabo Verde (20.6%). The number of tertiary students more than doubled between 2006 and 2011 from 50,225 to 110,181. These figures cover all levels of tertiary education: post-secondary non-degree programmes, bachelor's and master's and PhD programmes  Policy issues  The research sector has had little impact on technological progress in Benin and the rest of West Africa. Apart from obvious factors like underinvestment, this situation has resulted from the relatively low political commitment to science, technology and innovation on the part of individual countries. Across the sub-region, there is: * a lack of national research and innovation strategies or policies with a clear definition of measurable targets and the role to be played by each stakeholder; * a lack of involvement by private companies in the process of defining national research needs, priorities and programs; and * a lack of institutions devoted to innovation that can make the link between research and development (R&D;); * differences in education systems. * a lack of convergence among research programs; and * a low level of exchanges and collaboration between universities and research institutions. The region's first Policy on Science and Technology was adopted by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 2011. This policy tackles many of the issues outlined above. The main challenges facing research and development in Benin specifically are: * the unfavourable organizational framework for research: weak governance, a lack of co-operation between research structures and the absence of an official document on the status of researchers; * the inadequate use of human resources and the lack of any motivational policy for researchers; and * the mismatch between research and development needs.  Policy framework  In Benin, it is the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research which is responsible for implementing science policy. The National Directorate of Scientific and Technological Research handles planning and co-ordination, whereas the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research and National Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters each play an advisory role. Financial support comes from Benin‚Äôs National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation. The Benin Agency for the Promotion of Research Results and Technological Innovation carries out technology transfer through the development and dissemination of research results. The regulatory framework has evolved since 2006 when the country‚Äôs first science policy was prepared. This has since been updated and complemented by new texts on science and innovation (the year of adoption is between brackets): * a manual for monitoring and evaluating research structures and organizations (2013); * a manual on how to select research programmes and projects and apply to the National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation (2013) for competitive grants; * a draft act for funding scientific research and innovation and a draft code of ethics for scientific research and innovation were both submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014; * a strategic plan for scientific research and innovation (under development in 2015). Benin‚Äôs has also been making efforts to integrate science into existing policy documents: * Benin Development Strategies 2025: Benin 2025 Alafia (2000); * Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2011‚Äì2016 (2011); * Phase 3 of the Ten-year Development Plan for the Education Sector, covering 2013‚Äì2015; * Development Plan for Higher Education and Scientific Research 2013‚Äì2017 (2014). In 2015, Benin's priority areas for scientific research were: health, education, construction and building materials, transportation and trade, culture, tourism and handicrafts, cotton/textiles, food, energy and climate change.  Human and financial investment in science  In 2007, Benin counted 1,000 researchers (in head counts). This corresponds to 115 researchers per million inhabitants. The main research structures in Benin are the Centre for Scientific and Technical Research, National Institute of Agricultural Research, National Institute for Training and Research in Education, Office of Geological and Mining Research and the Centre for Entomological Research. The University of Abomey-Calavi was selected by the World Bank in 2014 to participate in its Centres of Excellence project, owing to its expertise in applied mathematics. Within this project, the World Bank has loaned $8 million to Benin. The Association of African Universities has also received funds to enable it to co-ordinate knowledge-sharing among the 19 universities in West Africa involved in the project. There are no available data on Benin's level of investment in research and development. In 2013, the government devoted 2.5% of GDP to public health. In December 2014, 150 volunteer health professionals travelled to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from Benin, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, as part of a joint initiative by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and its specialized agency, the West African Health Organisation, to help combat the epidemic. The Ebola epidemic has been a tragic reminder of the chronic under- investment in West African health systems. The Government of Benin devoted less than 5% of GDP to agricultural development in 2010, even though the members of the African Union had agreed to commit at least 10% of GDP to this area in the Maputo Declaration of 2003. They reiterated this goal in the Malabo Declaration adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'. However, African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10% target.  Research output  Benin has the third- highest publication intensity for scientific journals in West Africa, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded. There were 25.5 scientific articles per million inhabitants catalogued in this database in 2014. This compares with 65.0 per million for Gambia,49.6 for Cabo Verde, 23.2 for Senegal and 21.9 for Ghana. The volume of publications in this database tripled in Benin between 2005 and 2014 from 86 to 270. Between 2008 and 2014, Benin's main scientific collaborators were based in France (529 articles), United States (261), United Kingdom (254), Belgium (198) and Germany (156). Regional research centres  Several regional research centres have been set up since 2002 that are hosted by West African countries. Benin's participation in these centres should help it to develop science and technology.  African Biosafety Network of Expertise  The African Biosafety Network of Expertise was set up in February 2010 and is hosted by Burkina Faso. The centre was conceptualized in Africa's Science and Technology Plan of Action (2005). As of 2013, Benin had neither biosafety laws, nor confined field trials, according to the network.  Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency  The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) established the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) in Praia, the capital of Cabo Verde, in 2010. The centre has been established within the United Nations' Sustainable Energy for All programme. The mission of the centre is to create favourable framework conditions for renewable energy and energy efficiency markets in the 15 member states of ECOWAS. Since its founding, there has been growing external demand for its services. Two other centres in sub-Saharan Africa will seek to replicate the ECREEE model. One will be established by UNIDO and the East African Community to serve Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. A second will serve the 15 Member States of the Southern Africa Development Community. Both centres should be fully operational by 2014. Other centres are being established within the same network in the Caribbean and Pacific.  West African Biosciences Network  Established in 2002, the West African Biosciences Network (BeCA) was the first of four subregional hubs to be set up by the New Partnership for Africa's Development within the African Biosciences Initiative. BeCA has its hub at the Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research in Dakar. The other three networks are the Southern African Network for Biosciences, based at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria (South Africa), the Northern Africa Biosciences Network based at the National Research Centre in Cairo (Egypt) and the Biosciences Eastern and Central Africa Network based at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi (Kenya).  African Institutes for Mathematical Sciences  There are five African Institutes for Mathematical Sciences. These are situated in Cameroon (est. 2013), Ghana (est. 2012), Senegal (est. 2013), South Africa (est. 2003) and Tanzania (est. 2014). The one in Senegal teaches in both English and French. Each institute provides academic programmes in basic and applied mathematics, including cosmology, finance and computing, as well as interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics. Each also provides community services. The first institute was the brainchild of South African cosmologist Neil Turok. It is planned to develop 15 centres of excellence across Africa by 2023 within the Next Einstein Initiative, a name inspired by the idea that the next Einstein could come from Africa. The project is supported by numerous governments in Africa and Europe, as well as the Government of Canada.  West Africa Institute  The West Africa Institute was established in Praia (Cabo Verde) in 2010 to provide the missing link between policy and research in the regional integration process. The institute is a service provider, conducting research for regional and national public institutions, the private sector, civil society and the media. The think tank also organizes political and scientific dialogues between policy-makers, regional institutions and members of civil society.

He is best known as the Deputy Minister for Education and Culture, as Director of Working Groups who reports to the Government of Quebec, and as the second Director General of the Mus√©e de la Civilisation.  Biography  In Montreal, where he was born in 1934, Roland Arpin devoted several years of studies to his training as a teacher. He first obtained a certificate of higher education and then a baccalaureate in pedagogy at the University of Montreal, following the completion of a bachelor's degree from the same university.. He then began his career as an educator. He taught for 12 years, from primary to university. He then became a school administrator, from the Directorate of Personnel to the General Directorate at Coll√®ge de Maisonneuve for five years. Then, from 1972 to 1975, he became president of the F√©d√©ration des Coll√®ges d‚Äôenseignement g√©n√©ral et professionnel and the Center for Research and Animation in Education.  Responsibilities  In 1975, Roland Arpin became Assistant Deputy Minister for Planning and Budget Planning at the Quebec Ministry of Education. He was then responsible for policy and planning activities, economic and demographic studies, private education, the teaching resources department, computer science and continuing education. R. Arpin was appointed Deputy Minister of Cultural Affairs in 1980 and then Secretary of the Conseil du tr√©sor in 1984. This function placed him at the heart of government administration. Many government missions led him abroad. From 1976 to 1980, for instance, he served on the Education Commission of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, where he served as Vice-President for two years. In addition, he undertook many personal travels, taking him to the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Africa. In 1987, he was given the mission of founding the Museum of Civilization in Quebec City, which opened its doors the following year. He was the institution's director until 2001.. In February 1991, the Minister of Cultural Affairs entrusted him with the responsibility of developing a draft cultural policy for Quebec. In the same year, the Direction des Mus√©es de France entrusted him with the mandate to carry out an evaluation and prepare a recovery plan for the National Museum of Folk Arts and Traditions, located in Paris. In 2001, Roland Arpin set up the Soci√©t√© du 400e anniversaire de Qu√©bec (in anticipation of 2008), of which he was the first president and general manager, until 2004, when he retired aged 70 years old. Roland Arpin then said: ‚ÄúThere was some clearing work to be done, I did it. This organisation had to be given a boost. It is done. I consider that was my mandate. The years that remain before 2008 will be years of tug-of-war between the federal, provincial and municipal governments. I don't feel like going through this. There are battles that we don't feel like fighting.\\" And, questioned about his lasting work, the Museum that he founded and directed in Quebec City before, he concludes: ‚ÄúIt's the synthesis of my career. It sums up my profession as an educator, my taste for quality public service and the necessary openness that we must have on the world. \\" He died at the age of 76, on September 2, 2010, from Parkinson's disease.

They failed to capture the city, which was defended by about 1,700 Royalists under the command of Colonel William Sandys the acting governor, and retreated back to the Parliamentary stronghold of Gloucester. Prelude After the battle of Ripple Field (13 April 1643) and his defeat by Prince Maurice, Sir William Waller retreated to Tewkesbury, and on to Gloucester. When there he found orders to go to his headquarters which were located in Bristol. This he delayed to do, the historian J.W. Willis-Bund stated that Waller was probably thinking it was necessary to do something to maintain his reputation as there was no love lost between him and Essex. His bad luck in the operations against Maurice rendered it necessary for him to achieve something really brilliant before he returned to Bristol. He accordingly did not obey his orders, stating it would not be safe for him to leave Gloucester until Hereford and Worcester were reduced. He, therefore, set to work to carry out this out. From his spies Waller learnt it was possible, if a bold and sudden attack was made, that Hereford might be taken. Such work Waller loved, and he determined to try. With about 2,500 men he set out from Gloucester, and at daybreak on the 24 April appeared before Hereford. Some desultory fighting went on during the day, at times rather sharp, but the garrison had no heart in their resistance and deserted, so that there was nothing for Sir Richard Cave, the governor of Hereford, to do but to surrender. This he did, and on 25 April 1643. Waller entered Hereford in triumph. He was entitled to every credit that belongs to a bold and successful leader, and had more than restored his reputation as a conqueror. He had struck unexpectedly, and struck hard, with the result that he had dealt a blow where least expected, and one which was of considerable tactical importance, as he had severed the King's line of communication with Wales. With the capture of Reading on the next day (26 April) the Parliamentarians were now masters of the Thames valley. Nothing remained to prevent them carrying out their original idea of a dash on Oxford, provided Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller joined forces. To prevent them doing this was the task now set for Prince Rupert; this entailed his marching to the West of England. Maurice, on his return to Oxford, had brought with him as a trophy of his triumph over Waller one of his colours, probably taken at Ripple. The Royalists boasted that Maurice had made Waller a negligible quantity by what he had done. Maurice returned in triumph on 7 April; not more than 14 days had elapsed and Waller had not only undone all that Maurice professed to have accomplished, but also upset the future plans of the Royalists. They were naturally furious. The Royalist governors of Hereford and Reading were each brought to a court-martial, but both were acquitted. Secretary Nicholas, writing to the Marquis of Ormond, says: Parliament made the most of their triumphs. Their feelings were expressed in lines which speak more for their joy than their poetry: The third line referring to another Royalist disaster, the defeat of Sir Ralph Hopton, at the Battle of Sourton Down, by Major-General James Chudleigh, cites Rushworlh.

Waller's entry into Hereford was said to be \\"as great a deliverance as the Israelites passing the Red Sea\\". cites Burrough's Sermon. Essex taking Reading was \\"no less a miracle than the razing down the walls of Jericho with pitchers and rams' horns\\". cites Sedgwick' Sermon at Reading. There was cause for their exultation. These were the first really important successes the Parliament had gained in the Midlands, and if they had been able to hold Hereford and reap the fruits of their victory the war would doubtless ended sooner. But the difficulty was to find men to garrison at both Gloucester and Hereford. Waller had a force with which to raid the County, but not a sufficient force with which to garrison it. All he could do was to send out forays from Hereford to secure such supplies and plunder as could be secured, and bring in all arms and money that could be brought in. For instance, a band went to Holme Lacy, Viscount Scudamore's place, near Hereford, and were paid ¬£10 15s. to go back. The depredations were not confined to raids from Hereford. Waller's soldiers have referred to themselves as \\"saints\\", they were also thieves. In an account book of a lady who then resided in Hereford are these entries: cites Archaelogia, XXXVII, 210. Having got all he could, Waller saw it was useless to continue to hold Hereford, so resolved to return to Gloucester with his force, in order to carry out the remaining part of his plan and occupy Worcester. Probably his movements were hastened by the knowledge that the Royalists were making preparations to re-take Hereford. On 18 May Waller set out for Gloucester, and on 20 May Hereford was again occupied by the Royalists. The fate of Hereford had put the Worcester garrison on the alert. The Governor of Worcester, Sir William Russell, had gone to Oxford, Colonel William Sandys was, acting as governor. Russell, as Sheriff, had called out the posse comitalus, all between 16 and 60, to come in and serve King Charles I, but it does not appear that the summons had been largely obeyed. There was a good deal of insubordination among the Worcester garrison, and the supply of money and of provisions was far from regular. There was consequently much discontent. This had been kept alive by the fact that bands of Waller's raiders had come fairly near the town; they had been seen at Upton-upon- Severn, and probably at Powick, and some communication, was kept up between the discontented party in the city and the Parliament troops outside. Essex had appointed various persons who were favourable to the Parliament to offices in the Corporation during the time he had held the town in October 1642. By a Royal warrant of the 15 March 1643, cite Harl. MSS. 6802, 21. these persons had been removed and their places filled with Royalists. The removed men were still in Worcester, and did not regard the ruling power with favour. All this was told to Waller, and he was informed if he only appeared before the walls he would thereupon be joined by a strong party from within the city. Waller therefore determined to attack Worcester at once. Worcester City defences (1651) showing civil war additions including the extensive works to the south and south-east (the map is aligned with east to the top) by Treadway Nash. Worcester, in May 1643, was in a very different state from what it had been in September 1642 (see Worcester city walls). The walls had been rebuilt, the fortifications remade. Dud Dudley says, under his direction and supervision. Whether that was so or not, the place was now too strong to be carried without a regular siege. A force of some 300 volunteers had been raised and trained from among the citizens. The garrison, about 1,500 strong, was in readiness, and expected to be attacked, for Waller's raiders had been noticed at Malvern and elsewhere, Sandys believed all was prepared for Waller whenever he liked to come, and that he could hold the city if it was attacked. On the evening of 28 May handbills were scattered about the streets of Worcester: This invitation was cleverly worded, and was meant to appeal to all classes of the discontented. \\"Religion\\" referred to the lecturers who had been displaced for the parish clergy; \\"persons and goods\\" to the state of martial law and billeting that prevailed in a garrison town, to say nothing of the plundering of lawless ruffians like Colonel Hide; \\"privileges of the Corporation\\" to the displacement of the members by the Royal warrant. Waller appealed to all the parties who were aggrieved, and he believed he should not appeal in vain. Naturally, Sandys considered this handbill was the prelude to an immediate attack, so the troops were mustered, the gates closed. He was right; with the morning came Waller. Siege Leaving Gloucester on the afternoon of 28 May 1643, marching all night through Tewkesbury, Severn Stoke, and Kempsey, Waller reached Worcester about daybreak on the 29 May. Waller had with him a considerable force, about 3,000 strong, and 8 guns. It comprised all his cavalry, including the celebrated Gloucester Blue Regiment. It was obvious that he had come in earnest to deliver the oppressed. On arriving on the south side of the town he halted his men on the high ground above Diglis, sent his trumpeter to the Sidbury Gate to demand the surrender of the place. Colonel Sandys told him, in answer to his demand, that \\"he was not at Hereford\\", and had better be off. The trumpeter replied, rightly, that such an answer was most uncivil, and not such as he would take back to his general, Sandys on this told him very peremptorily to be off, and having said so Sandys returned to his quarters. The trumpeter would not leave, refusing to stir, basing his refusal on the fact that he was by the laws of war entitled to a civil answer to take back to his general. The sentry thereupon sent to Sandys asking for orders. Sandys returned not in the best of tempers, accompanied by one of his officers, Captain Beaumont, who commanded one of the regiments that formed the garrison. Sandys again asked the trumpeter why he did not go. The reply was short, decisive, and insulting. On this, Beaumont ordered the guard to fire at the trumpeter. One of them did so, hitting him in the thigh. He fell from his horse mortally wounded. A great and heated controversy arose over this \\"regrettable incident\\", the Parliament writers and speakers contending with some truth that the Royalists had deliberately violated a flag of truce, and killed, while doing his duty, a messenger under its protection, an act opposed to the laws of war; an outrage on civilization. The Royalists contended that the trumpeter, having discharged his mission received his answer, and, refusing to leave when ordered, had by such refusal forfeited all the protection a flag of truce gave him, and might be, and ought to be, as he had been, shot down like a dog. Whatever might be the rights or wrongs of the question, the death of his trumpeter was more than Waller could stand; it hastened his action. It was now about 06:00 Waller ordered the attack to be begun. Placing his guns in position they at once opened on the place. A long artillery duel followed. Some accounts say it lasted all day, some 16 hours (from 6:00 until 22:00); but this can hardly be so, having regard to the rest of the operations. Waller's guns were not able to suppress cannons of the city forts, still less to obtain the ascendant. One account says: An assault on the east of the City towards Friary Gate was repulsed with heavy loss to the assailants. In front of Diglis (to the south of the city) Waller fared better. After some hard fighting he carried a house just outside the walls near the Castle Hill, belonging to Mr. William Berkeley. This afforded Waller cover, from which he could fire on the city with safety, \\"annoying it and likewise the Friary\\". Sandys determined to dislodge Waller from this post, and after some severe fighting succeeded, not only in doing so, but also in burning the house, so that it was no longer tenable by Waller's men. A sortie was made from St. Martin's Gate (on the east of the city) against Waller's right flank by a party of the Royalist horse. They drove the Parliamentarians back on Waller's centre, near Greenhill, and cleared the east side of the city. The fighting was severe. Waller lost some 60 or 70 men. The result of this sortie, and the failure of his attack on the Diglis side, led Waller to consider his position. A report arrived urging the garrison to resist, as Lord Capel was on the way to their relief. This was untrue, but it was true that Maurice, wanting to show what he could do against Waller, had set out from Oxford with three regiments of horse to cut off Waller's retreat to Gloucester. With his troops discouraged by their defeat, encumbered with their wounded. Waller was in no position to resist an attack by Sandys on his front and by Maurice on his flank and rear, besides having the River Avon to cross in case of disaster. So Waller determined to retreat while he could. To get rid of the encumbrance of his wounded Waller collected all the boats round Worcester, and placing his wounded, baggage, and guns on board, sent them by water to Gloucester. He searched round Worcester to get horses, and is said to have been careful to send out as far north as Ombersley to carry off all those belonging to Colonel Sandys, the Governor of Worcester, and Martin Sandys, who was helping him. Having collected all he could, about 01:00 on the morning of 31 May Waller began his retreat towards Tewkesbury. His loss in this attack on Worcester was heavy; five or six captains and 160 soldiers were killed; the wounded filled several barges. But the fighting had been sharp, sharper than usual, especially round Diglis, and this accounts for the casualties. Sir Robert Cooke, on his return to Gloucester, sent the Speaker a fair account of Waller's defeat. He had been disappointed that there was no help from Worcester itself or from outside; Walter evidently feared an attack, or he would not have retired so quickly, or evacuated Tewkesbury so hastily. The Worcester garrison stated, obviously untruthfully, that their loss was only two men and three women. The gunners were said to have used eleven barrels of powder and 200 great shot. Aftermath The great point in the defence was the conduct of the Worcester women. All accounts say that they worked hard at the defences to relieve the soldiers. Nor did their labours end with the day's fighting. Waller had been able to make his attack with much greater effect from the cover and shelter he obtained against the fire from the walls by the trees, hedges, mounds, and fences outside the city walls, especially round Diglis, and also by the houses. It was decided that all the fences and mounds should be levelled, and also all houses and buildings situated like Mr. Berkeley's houses near the walls, which could be used by the enemy, removed. This it was decided should be done at once, in case Waller might return so women, out of every ward of the city, freely formed companies and levelled all the fortifications that were left behind by the Parliamentarians cites Townsend MSS., cited by Nash, Supplement, p. 37. The Worcester women need not have feared, Waller would not return; he was in no state to do so. As Cooke's letter shows, his position was far more serious than the Parliamentarians were willing to admit. Excuses were made for him. It was said that his zeal and his successes had made him attack a fortified city with an improper, insufficient, inadequate force. The Lord General the Earl of Essex, who had long been jealous of Waller's popularity and reputation, censure him severely. Waller had no answer to make; for as the historian Willis-Bund states he had blundered, and blundered badly. To Worcester is due the honour of having checked the victorious career of the most popular, and hitherto the most successful, of the Parliamentary generals. Six weeks later, he was to receive at the Battle of Roundway Down (13 July 1643) a crushing blow that ruined his reputation as a general. Truly Waller said \\"Worcestershire was not a lucky place for him\\".

Tong Viet Buong was born in about 1773 in Phu Cam near the Citadel of Hue, in a Catholic family and was in the court at that time. Growing up, he went to the imperial court, and was prompted by his agility and courage. King Minh Mang assigned him to administer a team of about 50 people, then he was made to the guard office. In 1831, there was a revolt in Da Vach area in Quang Ngai province, King Minh Mang sent him to get rid of disorder. After returning, when he reported to the king about the situation, the king asked, \\"Are you going to Non Nuoc Pagoda?\\", He replied \\"no\\", because he is Catholic so he does not go to the temple. That made Minh M·∫°ng angry, and arrested him abandoned. He refused, and so he was beaten 80 times, lost his title, and had to go to the barracks in the barracks. But thanks to him to pay money for mandarin, he was released. In December 1832, when he was about to issue a decree banning Catholicism, the king checked the list of Catholic guards, but found him missing, and the king immediately ordered him to be incarcerated. During his time in prison, he was tortured and tortured about three times a month. He was beheaded on October 23, 1833, and was bullied in the middle of the market. On May 27, 1900, he was beatified by Pope Leo XIII. On June 19, 1988, Pope John Paul II canonized him. According to Catholic documents, during his imprisonment, a prison officer wanted to give him a lightweight shackles, but he refused: \\"Please add more shackles for heavier because they have hit before. me but not enough \\". During the interrogation, the officer told him to quit, he said: \\"I definitely do not tolerate God created the heaven and earth of all that I worshiped in the past, how can I quit? So he was beaten. Then the soldiers forced him to step on the image of the Atonement, when he resisted and shouted, \\"This is a big deal to do, I do not go with it.\\" At times, the companion said, \\"Hey, follow the time of your life, now the king is in rage, please obey the king for good time, do?\\".

The officer appointed to execute him decided to execute the main judgment on the right path in front of the martyr's daughter's entrance gate. Announced for a while, she ran to the street. \\"I saw my father, she recounted. He looked at me without saying a word.

The differences from the F-4E, due to pressure from the Japan Socialist Party, were the removal of key apparatus such as the nuclear bomb pre-flight controller (DCU-9/A), weapons release computer (ASQ-91), Bullpup air-to-ground missile controller (ARW-77) and aerial refuelling equipment. ; 1972 :At the US-Japan meetings in Hawaii, President Richard Nixon persuaded Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to buy the P-3C and E-2C. ; 1978 :25 December ‚Äì The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accuses McDonnell-Douglas of paying Japanese government officials US$15,000 in 1975 as bribes to buy their aircraft. ; 1979 :4 January ‚Äì The SEC accuses Grumman of paying various Japanese government officials (Nobusuke Kishi, Takeo Fukuda, Yasuhiro Nakasone, Raiz≈ç Matsuno and others) bribes via Nissh≈ç Iwai (now Sojitz) to buy their E-2C aircraft.

Pacific Appeal was an African-American newspaper based in San Francisco, California and published from April 1862 to June 1880.  History  Pacific Appeal was co-founded by Philip Alexander Bell, an African-American civil rights and antislavery activist who had established Weekly Advocate (edited by Samuel Cornish) and worked for William Lloyd Garrison's Liberator, and Peter Anderson, a San Francisco civil rights activist and delegate at the California Colored Citizens Convention. It was the successor to The Mirror of the Times, another San Francisco-based African-American newspaper that had been established in 1855, with the change of name occurring along with a change of proprietor from Judge Mifflin W. Gibbs to William H. Carter. Its contemporaries at the time included the Anglo-African, and it was regarded as the official organ of African-Americans on the Pacific slope. The paper‚Äôs motto was ‚ÄúHe who would be free, himself must strike the blow.‚Äù It began publishing in April 1862. Later, Bell and Anderson would split, with Bell accusing Anderson of becoming less antislavery and more accommodationist.  External coverage  The coverage of antislavery and civil rights issues in the first few years has been covered by historians and chroniclers of black abolitionism of the era, including in The Afro-American Press and Its Editors.  Notable content  The inaugural 1862 volume contained eight antislavery poems, including four poems by San Francisco poet James Madison Bell, writing under the initials JMB. Pacific Appeal also published some 250 proclamations by Emperor Norton, self-proclaimed Emperor of the United States, including his proposals for what would later become the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube.\\"Bridge Proclamations\\", The Emperor Norton Trust  See also  *List of African-American newspapers in California  References   African-American newspapers Publications established in 1862 Publications disestablished in 1880 Defunct newspapers published in California Newspapers published in San Francisco 1862 establishments in California 1880 disestablishments in the United States ","title":"Pacific Appeal"},{"id":"55170390","text":"Idris Dawud (born June 12, 1991) is a Mexican basketball player for Centauros de Chihuahua and the Mexico national basketball team.FIBA profile He participated at the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup.2017 FIBA AmeriCup profile References External links * Idris Dawud Alvarado at RealGM 1991 births Living people Mexican men's basketball players Point guards UC Riverside Highlanders men's basketball players Bethany Swedes men's basketball players Halcones de Ciudad Obreg√≥n players Halcones de Xalapa players Toros de Nuevo Laredo players Basketball players from California Sportspeople from San Diego ","title":"Idris Dawud (basketball)"},{"id":"55170397","text":"Waller de MontmorencyNPG details (b and d Knocktopher; 1841 - 1924) was an Anglican priest in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most notably Archdeacon of Ossory from 1911 until his death.thePeerage.com A graduate of Trinity College, CambridgeAlumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of All Known Students, Graduates and Holders of Office at the University of Cambridge, from the Earliest Times to 1900, John Venn/John Archibald Venn Cambridge University Press > (10 volumes 1922 to 1953) Part II. 1752‚Äì1900 Vol. ii p275 1944 he was ordained in 1866.Crockford's Clerical Directory 1908 p390: London, Horace Cox, 1908 He was the incumbent at Kilsheelan; and Treasurer of St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny.

It aired on October 10, 2017, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Todd Kubrak, and directed by Bradley Buecker. Plot A mass-shooting occurs at Kai Anderson's political rally. He appears to have been shot and several people are killed. The police arrive and Ally is shown holding the gun. Earlier, Meadow Wilton tells Ally Mayfair-Richards that Ally is being targeted by a cult, of which her wife Ivy is a member, before Meadow is dragged away. Ally sneaks over to the Wilton's house and finds Meadow tied up. Ally rescues Meadow and takes her in the Mayfair-Richards' restaurant. Meadow tells Ally that the cult has been responsible for the events that happened to Ally recently, and explains Ivy hates Ally and hence joined the cult. She also explains she fell in love with Kai, but after realizing the feeling wasn't reciprocated, she attempted to leave the cult but was caught. A flashback to the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals that Ivy admitted to Kai that she hates Ally ever since their son Oz was born, as Ivy is infertile, and Ally wouldn't let her feed Oz. Kai uses this to manipulate Ivy into supporting him, and they plot on how Ivy can leave Ally while gaining full custody of Oz. After leaving Meadow with Dr. Rudy Vincent, so Rudy can question Meadow and be Ally's witness, Ally goes to see Sally Keffler, a rival candidate to Kai, and tells her about the cult, which Sally believes. However, the cult arrive and Kai kills Sally, making her death appear like suicide. Ally hides, but is found by Ivy. However, Ivy doesn't notify the cult. When Ally returns to Rudy, he says Meadow left after, unknown to Rudy, she got a call from Kai. Rudy doesn't believe Ally about the cult. At the rally, it's revealed Meadow was responsible for the shooting. When Ally tries to stop her, she reveals she is still loyal to Kai, and loves him. She then shoots herself. Kai is shown to have survived. Production On October 7, 2017, it was confirmed that the sixth episode of the season would be edited as a direct result of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting that occurred six days earlier. The episode originally featured a scene lasting 2 minutes and 16 seconds where Leslie Grossman's character Meadow Wilton begins to fire at Evan Peters' character, as well as a crowd, during a campaign speech. The episode was edited to de-emphasize the violence and to mostly have it featured completely off-screen  as a result the opening sequence of the episode was cut in half, several on-screen deaths were removed and two separate close-up shots of the handgun firing were removed. While only the edited episode was broadcast on FX, the original uncut episode was released via VOD, FXNOW and FX+. Reception \\"Mid-Western Assassin\\" was watched by 2.15 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 1.0 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Mid-Western Assassin\\" holds an 82% approval rating, based on 17 reviews with an average rating of 7.52 out of 10. Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5, saying \\"The episode is explosive, obviously, but the subtle machinations of the making of a murderess also helps show the implosion of the political body. The audience sees what the voters see. Violence can erupt at any time, regardless of crime statistics. But we also see how anyone can be a killer, even the bad neighbor next door.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B, and enjoyed Ivy's flashback and the reason behind her hate for Ally. However, she also criticized the constant reuse of some sets, like the Butchery's. Vulture's Brian Moylan gave the episode a 3 out of 5, with a mixed to positive review. He praised the character of Meadow and the statements made by this season and this episode, especially about gun violence and \\"the fear-mongering Trumpian dystopia that we‚Äôre living in and the myopic identity politics of the liberal elite\\". However, contrary to Rosenfield, he criticized the character of Ivy and the reason that made her join the cult. He also expressed some doubts about why the cult decided to target Ally. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 7.6 out of 10, with a positive review. He said \\"Cult remains steady in its storytelling, using a behind-the-scenes look at Kai's demented movement to show us just how the general public's strings are being pulled. With this episode ending in a final gruesome stunt (that unfortunately hits very close to home, headline-wise) designed to catapult Kai to the top of politics, we're due for a bit of a reset. If one doesn't come, let's hope this episode marks a turning point for the season in some way.\\" References External links * American Horror Story: Cult episodes ","title":"Mid-Western Assassin"},{"id":"55170600","text":"\\"Holes\\" is the fifth episode of the seventh season of the anthology television series American Horror Story. It aired on October 3, 2017, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Crystal Liu, and directed by Maggie Kiley. Plot Bob denounces Beverly's sensational spins on stories. Beverly insists that the tape of Serena's murder be aired and Bob fires her. She counters with a threat to reveal his sexual relationship with Serena. Winter briefs fellow followers of Kai on her informal tracking of Kai's voter awareness. They debate making the clown murders more shocking to increase the fear factor. Beverly informs Kai that Bob refuses to air Serena's murder and Kai resolves that Bob be murdered in the most scandalous way possible. Ivy arrives to the meeting late and asks the group what she has missed, revealing her involvement. Ally tells Rudy that she has been envisioning bugs boring into holes in her neck. Rudy asserts that her fear of holes correlates with voids in her life. She is not coping well with her separation from Ivy and Oz and is distraught that she is alone in a house marked by the clowns. Ally explains to Rudy that she can't stay in a hotel because her finances are locked with Ivy's. Ally notes that she feels as if Ivy planned the separation. Rudy suggests that Ally focus on things she can control. Kai, Beverly, Winter, Ivy, Harrison, Detective Samuels, Gary, and R.J. don clown attire and invade Bob's home. Bob, after suffering some blows, whines that he has a captive gimp in his attic. Kai and his followers head up to the attic to find the gimp suspended by hooks. Kai stabs the gimp, the hooks rip open his skin, and he falls to the ground. Winter comforts Ivy after she darts out of the attic to vomit. The remaining clowns drag a bound and gagged Bob to the attic and they take turns stabbing him on camera. Beverly concludes his torment by cleaving him in the head with an axe. Beverly confides to Kai that she feels that their following has a weak link. The two leaders resolve to sever that link to bring the others to heel. Kai declares to his gathered followers that they are going to take care of R.J., gagged and tied to a chair. Ivy begs Kai to relent and he hands her a nail gun. R.J. pleads through his gag as Ivy reluctantly drives a nail into his head. Harrison, Gary, Beverly, Samuels, and Winter each take a turn shooting him thereafter. Kai finishes him off. Ally observes Harrison via telescope toting a shovel and a nondescript bag into his house. She also witnesses him kiss Detective Samuels. Ally investigates the Wilton residence and finds Meadow in a dug-up hole in the backyard. She then flees home and calls 911. She calls Ivy after being put on hold and Ivy dismisses her. Meadow bangs on the window, pleads to Ally for safety, and lets it slip that she has excommunicated from a ‚Äúsick cult‚Äù that Ivy is a part of before she is caught and dragged away. Beverly probes Kai about the whereabouts of his parents. Kai recounts his paraplegic father questioning his mother angrily about her infidelity. One day soon after, his mother shot his father and then herself. Rudy, revealed to be Kai and Winter's brother, taking into account the damage a parental murder-suicide could do to his budding career, helped Kai cover up their parents‚Äô deaths by mummifying their bodies with lye and sealing them in their bedroom. Kai admits that he visits their remains and communes with them.

Moreover, she enjoyed the reveal of Kai's backstory as well as the twist on the identity of his brother. Vulture's Brian Moylan gave the episode a 4 out of 5, indicating a positive review. He praised in particular the character of Kai Anderson, and the twists of the episode. Finally, he gave a positive comment on the overall structure of the season, calling it \\"much better and more logical\\" than the past seasons. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10, with a positive review. He said \\"Cult found solid footing with \\"Holes\\" and its angle focusing on the villains' side of the mass hoax, but it's best we don't linger here too long.

Based in Singapore, San Francisco and Basel, it manages a freight rate and logistics transportation management system for large international supply chains. Haven is considered one of the pioneers of the digital revolution in shipping logistics. History Matt Tillman, a serial tech entrepreneur, had the idea for a freight and logistics platform in 2014, when he tried to book space on a container vessel to ship a truck. He created a reverse auction over email, treating all freight forwarders the same, and realized that the process could be automated. Tillman met with Jeff Wehner, who had worked in supply chain at Apple and Nest. They concluded that the traditional carrier-forwarder-shipper procurement structure was not the best model for shippers in terms of price discovery and booking. Together with Renee DiResta, they founded Haven Inc. In the beginning, Haven gave shippers an online platform to compare and reserve container slots from 10 ocean carriers. The company offered 600,000 sailings (or shipment schedules) from 1,500 ports. Haven's strongest demand was coming from the consumer goods, electronics, and high-value agriculture industries of Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The company surpassed $3.4 billion a year in cargo value in 2016, according to CEO Tillman, who said that Haven's revenue doubled as soon as Donald Trump became the US president, as his protectionist policy caused a spike in the shipping of commodities such as metals because of fears of future tariffs. As of March, Haven worked with 20 of the 25 top ocean carriers and every major freight forwarder. In April, the company introduced a transportation management system to enable shippers to become more efficient in their role as transportation buyers. Transportation management system Haven transportation management system, launched in April 2017, is a cloud- based logistics platform for managing large international supply chains. It is intended for ocean freight companies, primarily commodity traders, food suppliers, and consumer goods companies. Shippers can book and track shipments using their own book of carriers and forwarders. They are given direct contact with logistics providers without the need for a middleman or email. The platform helps automate common workflows such as freight booking, rate management, and documentation generation.

It originated with L√©on Talabot et Compagnie, founded by L√©on Talabot in 1824. The factory specialized in manufacturing steel handtools such as files, scythes and sickles, but later moving into manufacture of machine tools. It closed in 1983 and was liquidated in 1984. Several successor companies acquired some of the facilities and continue to operate. Origins (1824‚Äì81) The factory in Saint-Juery, Tarn, was founded in 1824 as L. Talabot & Cie. The factory was near to Albi, Tarn, specializing in steel production and the manufacture of tools. It was located beside a rocky gorge on the Tarn river, holding a falls where the water drops by about . The factory used the river as a source of power, and produced hardware such as files and scythes. The first rolling mills were installed in 1831. The Soci√©t√© L√©on Talabot was formed in May 1832 and was restructured in 1840. The Soci√©t√© de Mokta el Hadid was established in Algeria in 1863. Plans were drawn up to combine the Mokta el Hadid mines with the Firminy, Loire, steelworks, the Gard coal mines and the Saut-du-Tarn steelworks. 20 million francs of capital would be needed, including 8 million of fresh capital for upgrades at the various sites. These plans dragged out and came to nothing. In 1870, the Soci√©t√© L√©on Talabot was liquidated and on 11 March 1870 sold to the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Aci√©ries du Tarn. The products were marketed under the TALABOT and SDT brands. Peak period (1881‚Äì1950) Blast furnace in Saint-Ju√©ry In 1881 a rolling mill hall was built with two mills. In 1882 a coke-fired blast furnace was installed for production of cast iron. The 1886 film Carmaux, d√©fournage du coke by Lumi√®re is a one-minute sequence of men lifting a large coal block out of a smelter in Carmaux. The first hydroelectric power station was built in 1898, supplying electricity to the factory and the village. In 1904 there were 1,545 workers in factories that covered The hydraulic power plant was delivering . In 1913 the company had assets of 11.2 million francs. New rolling mills were installed in 1913. During the period from 1884 to 1934, many peasants came to work in the steel works from Cahuzaguet, Saint-Gr√©goire, Arth√®s, les Avalats and Marsal. Many settled in Saint-Ju√©ry, which grew from 1,400 inhabitants in the 19th century to 7,000 inhabitants today. By 1925 there were 2,500 workers. Jacques de Nervo began his career in 1919 by joining the Soci√©t√© du Saut-du-Tarn. He became general secretary of the company in 1921, a director, then president and chief executive officer. The Centre des jeunes patrons was created due to the concerns of private business owners after the Popular Front won the 1936 elections. The honorary president was Baron Jacques de Nervo, vice-president of the Soci√©t√© du Saut-du-Tarn and a member of the board of the Union des industries et m√©tiers de la m√©tallurgie (UIMM). A January 1948 illustrated catalog lists a wide range of scythes, sickles and other edged tools. The company made Talabot-brand sickles (faucilles √† dents) with fine serrated teeth. These sickles would have a series of ridges on the blade at an angle of about 45% to the cutting edge. The ridges ensured the serrations remained when the tool was sharpened. Decline and closure (1950‚Äì83) Starting in 1950, production of hardware was reduced and the factory began to manufacture machine tools. A Swedish rolling mill was installed in 1960 for manufacture of steel for files. By 1960, the Talabot-brand tooth sickles were mainly sold in North Africa rather than France. Claude Dupuy, Archbishop of Albi, intervened in the threatened closure of the Saut-du-Tarn steel plant in 1968. In 1978 the factory produced 11,696 tons of laminated steel, 1,894 tons of iron, 3,511,500 files, 1,203 tons of tools and more than 4,000 valves for the hydraulic and oil industry. With the collapse of the iron and steel industry, the factory closed in 1983. Those over 50 years old received 90% of their gross salary before retirement. The Saut du Tarn company was liquidated in 1984. Five new companies were created in 1984, including the ALST (Aci√©ries et Laminoirs du Saut du Tarn), later renamed the AEDT (Aciers et Energies du Tarn). As of 2015, there were still steel enterprises in the village of Saint-Ju√©ry that employed over 250 people making hydraulic and oil valves, agricultural tools and speciality steel. A museum is located in the former industrial site in the building that housed the first hydroelectric plant.

The war and its aftermath contributed significantly to the formation of Laos. In the war, Lan Xang defended itself against ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát‚Äôs attempt to expand westward and take greater control of Southeast Asia. The war ended inconclusively as neither side was able to achieve victory. Eventually, Lan Xang recovered and began to flourish again while ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát gained its position as the strongest nation in Southeast Asia. Background and initial relationships The history of Lan Xang began in 1351 when Fa Ngum, the exiled prince of the Tai kingdom of Muang Sua, led an army north from the Khmer Empire to reclaim the throne of his forefathers. As Fa Ngum traveled toward Muang Sua, his army grew into a powerful force by defeating rivals, subduing local mandalas, and gaining the support of the Kingdom of Muang Phuan. ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát at the time was an independent kingdom enjoying 500 years of freedom from Chinese domination. The Vietnamese, however, were in the midst of a centuries long conflict with the powerful Champa Kingdom. Concerned about potential attacks from the Cham, the king of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát sought Fa Ngum out in 1351 and entered into a border treaty to preclude war with the warrior prince. Two years later Fa Ngum successfully conquered Muang Sua and secured the crown for himself. One of the first actions that the newly crowned king took at the time was to rename the country Lan Xang. After the borders were secured in the early years after Fa Ngum‚Äôs conquests, Lan Xang lived peaceably with its neighbors for over half a century. ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and the Champa Kingdom, however, continued their war. The relationship between Lan Xang and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát begins to deteriorate In 1402, Lan Xang entered into a treaty with the Ming Dynasty of China and was recognized as a ‚Äútributary ‚Äòbarbarian‚Äô ruler responsible for maintaining peace and security on China‚Äôs southern frontier.‚Äù Shortly thereafter the Ming invaded ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. In 1407 the Chinese defeated the Vietnamese and began their fourth period of domination. During the twenty-year span of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát‚Äôs fourth period of Chinese domination, the good relationship between Lan Xang and ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát began to degenerate. In 1418, L√™ L·ª£i, the son of a Vietnamese aristocrat, initiated a guerrilla war against the Ming. In 1421 during ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát‚Äôs fight for independence, the king of Lan Xang offered L√™ L·ª£i military assistance. When the Lao forces arrived in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, however, they immediately took the side of the Chinese. Although the participation of Lan Xang‚Äôs forces in the war eventually proved to be short-lived, their action was seen by the Vietnamese as betrayal. In 1428, L√™ L·ª£i eventually defeated the Ming and established a new Vietnamese dynasty. For the next 32 years, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát and Lan Xang lived peaceably. During this time, Lan Xang was preoccupied by internal strife while ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát warred again with the Cham. Vietnamese aggression begins Beginning with the reign of Vietnamese king L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng in 1460, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát began to act aggressively toward its neighbors. Neighboring Laotian territories were annexed and designated as tributary to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. Skirmishes were likely fought, but an all-out war did not develop as the Vietnamese continued to be concerned about threats from their historical enemies, the Chinese and the Cham. In 1471, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát was strong enough and confident enough that they invaded the Champa Kingdom, overwhelmed their army, and effectively ended the Cham polity. In that same year, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát also moved to make Lan Xang‚Äôs tributary mandala, Muang Phuan, an administrative prefecture with Vietnamese mandarins as administrators. This overt action created a revolt which ultimately resulted in a massacre of Vietnamese occupation forces in 1478. As a result, the Vietnamese invaded Lan Xang in 1479 and the war between the two kingdoms commenced. With respect to the invasion and war, the Vietnamese felt that they were justified threefold. Most importantly, the Vietnamese king L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng believed that Lan Xang was responsible for the massacre of Vietnamese troops in 1478. Secondly, the Vietnamese wanted revenge for the betrayal that they suffered in 1421 during their war of independence against the Chinese when military help was promised by Lan Xang but not delivered. And finally as a third justification, the Vietnamese king was highly insulted during these times when he was sent a chest containing the dung of a white elephant by the Laotian king. Because of this final affront, the conflict came to be known as ‚Äúthe White Elephant War.‚Äù The war of 1479-1480 At the outset of the war, the Vietnamese king ordered a large army to cross into Muang Phuan and from there to attack Lan Xang in fall 1479. Estimates of the tactics used by the Vietnamese vary from a single wave of three columns to a single wave of five columns to multiple waves of an amassed force. As the Vietnamese advanced, the Lao army formed and marched to confront the invaders. The two armies first met on the Plain of Jars in Muang Phuan where a battle was fought for several days. Estimates of the number of men in the armies were as large as 200,000 men on a side. Historians believe, however, that such estimates were ‚Äúgrossly exaggerated.‚Äù The initial battle in Muang Phuan was won by the Vietnamese and the Lao army retreated. The Vietnamese army continued to advance and ultimately sacked Lan Xang‚Äôs capital, Xieng Dong Xieng Thong (Luang Prabang). Losses were reported to be very high. Food supplies were seized by the Vietnamese; houses and villages were burned and destroyed. Populations of Lao citizens fled as did the elderly Lao king, Chakkaphat Phaen Phaeo. After losing their capital, the Laotians rallied. There are, however, multiple versions of this part of the war. One account reported that Then Kham, a son of the Laotian king, who was serving as the governor of Muong Dan Sai, attacked the Vietnamese with fresh units of the Lao army. In this history, the exhausted and depleted Vietnamese were defeated at the Battle of PƒÅk Ph≈´n and then straggled back to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. The Vietnamese forces pushed the Laotian resistance all the way to the upper Irrawaddy River, eventually reached the Burmese kingdom of Ava. A second account of the fighting reported that the Vietnamese split their forces after the capture of the Lao capital intent upon continuing the offensive and conquering the mandala Lan Na by means of a pincer attack. In this chronicle, the Vietnamese troops in the south were defeated by fresh troops from Lan Xang along with an army from NƒÅn, a vassal state of Lan Na; meanwhile the Vietnamese troops in the north withdrew voluntarily after negotiations and/or under the threat of an invasion from the Chinese. Regardless of the actual scenario, the Vietnamese withdrew back to their border and the war ended with the exception of one last attack the following year against Muang Phuan intended ‚Äúas punishment for aiding Lan Xang.‚Äù Aftermath After the war, the northern part of kingdom Muang Phuan (today Houaphanh and Xiangkhouang) was renamed Tran Ninh by Vietnamese and merged with Nghe An province of Dai Viet, the southern remain under Lan Xang control. Lan Xang and Dai Viet lived alongside one another in a peaceful manner for the next two centuries until Lan Xang‚Äôs decline and partition in the early 18th century. In Lan Xang, Buddhist monks from the major monasteries organized the rebuilding of the Laotian capital. Ultimately, the destruction and rebirth of Xieng Dong Xieng Thong was a catalyst for a golden age in Lan Xang where governance was fine-tuned, art flourished and beautiful temples were erected. During this time, Lan Xang enjoyed close relations with the Ayutthaya and Lan Na Kingdoms and emerged as one of the most powerful states in Southeast Asia. At the end of the war with Lan Xang, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát retained its position as the single strongest kingdom in Southeast Asia. Over the next two centuries no longer impeded by the Cham, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát used its strength to expand to the south first colonizing what is now central Vietnam and by the 18th century occupying Prey Nokor and encroaching into the Mekong Delta. For the most part, however, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát was occupied during these times by continuing internal conflict including peasant revolts against the Later L√™ dynasty; the revolution and rule of the M·∫°c dynasty; and the fight for power between the Tr·ªãnh lords and the Nguy·ªÖn lords.

In traditional or economically undeveloped regions, humans often suffer and die from infectious diseases or of malnutrition due to poor food, water, and air quality. As economic development occurs, these environmental issues are reduced or solved, and others begin to arise. There is a shift in the character of these environmental changes, and as a result, a shift in causes of death and disease.  Risk transition framework  Figure 1. Relationship between demographic, epidemiological, and environmental risk transitions Several transition frameworks have been established to better understand the impacts of socioeconomic development. Of these, the oldest and most well-known framework is the Demographic transition framework, which was established in the 1940s. This describes the shift from high fertility and high mortality in underdeveloped societies to lower fertility and mortality rates as a result of development. Then around 1970, the Epidemiological transition framework was used to characterize changes in the health of societies during development. To better categorize causes of death and disease when studying the epidemiological shifts more well-defined categories were created to describe illnesses and injuries: # I. Traditional, infectious, nutritional, perinatal, and maternal causes # II. Modern, cancer, heart, neuro-psychiatric, chronic lung, diabetes, and congenital causes # III. Non-transitional injuries, both unintentional and intentional Figure 2. This illustrates the overall environmental risk transition framework, with traditional risks such as household sanitation decreasing, modern global risks such as global warming increasing, and transitional community risks, such as urban pollution rising, then falling as societies become more wealthy and developed.In 1990, environmental health researcher Kirk R. Smith at the University of California, Berkeley proposed the \\"risk transition\\" framework in relation to the established demographic and epidemiological transition frameworks. This theory was based on the concept that there must be a shift in risk factors leading up to a shift in causes of death and disease. In efforts to prevent, rather than respond to diseases, the risk transition was further studied and quantified. Figure 1 shows the relationship between risk, epidemiological, and demographic transition, in which risk factors change to affect patterns of disease and health, which in turn affects the demographic. However, a shift in population also impacts the risk factors, and so these three frameworks all show significant impact on one another. The \\"environmental risk transition\\" framework further developed by Smith then more specifically categorizes the risks as traditional and modern as well as spatially. Based on the framework, during the first stages of development, environmental health issues concentrated in the household, such as poor sanitation, are resolved by shifting them into the community, causing issues such urban pollution. This can be labeled as traditional and modern risks, respectively. Then, upon further development, these risks in the community are decreased and shifted to the global environment, creating concern for changes such as heightened greenhouse gas emissions, etc. Modern risks, in contrast to traditional risks, tend to be accrued over time in which adverse effects do not have single identifiable causes. These categorizations were made since it was found that the majority of environmental risks associated with category I diseases presented itself in the household, and as these were resolved with development, the impact of environmental causes of category II diseases became more significant and emerged at the community level. This concept is illustrated in Figure 2.  Quantifying  Utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) and the Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) managed by the World Health Organization (WHO), empirical data was gathered to test the environmental risk transition framework.  Measuring development  Well established metrics of quantifying development in a society include income per capita adjusted for local purchasing power in 2000. This is termed dollars of gross domestic product/capita, adjusted for purchasing power ($PPP/capita). Similarly, the Human Development Index (HDO), utilizes a combination of purchasing power income per capita, life expectancy, and education level in 2000 to measure development in a population.  Risk metric  To understand the effects of environmental risks internationally, a per capita measure of a risk factor's impact is more useful, so risks were quantified in percent of total disease burden measured in % Disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) and burden per capita (DALYs per 1000 capita). = Household = The following summarizes the three major environmental risks present in households with young children most at risk: * Poor water, sanitation, and hygiene significantly contribute to cases of diarrhea. * Solid fuel use, such as biomass or coal used for cooking and heating emit pollutants that contribute to acute lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. * Lack of household management, such as screening, pesticides, and bed nets leads to significant levels of malaria today. With increased development as indicated in dollars of gross domestic product/capita, adjusted for purchasing power ($PPP/capita) the household environmental risks declined considerably. Between poor and rich countries as determined by $PPP/capita, there was a more than two orders of magnitude decline observed in household risks. = Community = With development, pollution is expanded into the larger community as shown in the air pollution created by industrialization. The following names major environmental risks are present at the community level: * Urban outdoor air pollution. * Lead pollution from gasoline and industrial sources. * Occupational risks such as carcinogens, injuries, noise, and poor ergonomics. * Traffic accidents for both drivers and pedestrians. It has been found that there are more rises and falls in community risks with development in comparison to household risks, and the pattern of risk is more complicated and not as pronounced. However, a general pattern of overall rising with development, then following can be seen in traffic accidents and air pollution. Lead and occupational risks, however, displayed varying significantly. = Global = The WHO CRA only analyzed one environmental risk that presents itself at the global level: * Climate change, which currently has relatively insignificant impact on human health. No data was collected for other global risks such as ozone depletion and land- use changes for the project. It has been found that climate change has thus far had minimal impact on human health worldwide. However, exposure to climate change will continue to increase in future years, which may magnify prevalent risks such as malaria. Results show that risks from climate change decreased with increased development, highlighting that poorer populations are more susceptible and in contact with the diseases affected by climate change. This contradicts the environmental transition framework since it takes account of where the risk is experienced rather than where it originates from. However, it remains true, that as development proceeds, the global risk of climate change expands as well.  Limitations  Many important environmental health risks could not be addressed and analyze throughout the study. Considered, a \\"super distal risk factor\\", environmental risk factors have some influence in every disease. Thus, the study assigned at least 5% of environmental burden of disease of every disease to the environment, with larger proportions to diseases like diarrhea with direct attribution to environmental factors. With no better and reasonable method of accounting for environmental factors, the uniform 5% distribution is not realistic, but was used as a way to account for the estimated burden of environmental factors in diseases. A better understanding of the full causal web establishing various relationships between environmental and other risk factors to their respective diseases would be necessary for a more comprehensive study. Furthermore, the study does not take into account high-consequence, low probability hazards which include natural disasters (earthquakes, tsunamis), high-impact technological failures (nuclear explosion), new and old infectious diseases caused by human activities such as trade, tourism, etc.  Conclusion  Main conclusions: * Category I (infectious diseases) in poor countries dominates the world burden of ill health. * There is no apparent substitution of Category II (chronic) disease for category I during development as is often instead. The data showed that both categories of diseases decreased with increased wealth. * Category III (injuries) risks decrease with increased wealth. A true and comprehensive test of the environmental risk transition hypothesis remains unattainable with the accessible data. However, by using the database of the WHO CRA project, a cross-sectional analysis of environmental health transition reveals some valuable takeaways: * A significant amount of infectious diseases found in poor countries is caused by household environmental risks, as much as one fifth of all disease in poor countries. * Household environmental risks decline significantly and nearly uniformly with development. * Community risks account for 4.3% of the GBD, with highest rates in middle-income countries. ** Impacts of lead and occupational risks show less consistent trends than road traffic accidents and air pollution potentially because of regulatory and technological intervention. * Global risk from climate change accounts for 0.4% of GBD and is sharply declining with development. ** The source of global risk however, is trending steeply upwards * trends of environmental risk at different spatial scales generally support the environmental risk transition hypothesis.  Risk overlap  In the environmental risk transition framework, there exists the concept of \\"risk overlap\\" which describes societies that experience both the traditional and modern, household and community risks simultaneously. The population that is especially susceptible to this condition is the urban slum. People tend to live in poor household environments while also affected by the contamination of the city, such as air pollution, traffic, and solid waste. Risk overlap creates interactions between different risks such as: * Risk genesis: New risks are generated, such toxic wastes from garbage dumps. * Risk transfer: Attempts to control one risk may cause other risks to increase in severity, such as using pesticides for disease prevention. * Risk synergism: One risk alters the sensitivity or susceptibility to other risks, such as increased mortality of undernourished children who have limited access to health services. These overlap situations may further concentrate the harmful effects of environment risks present in the community and deepen the burden of disease and ill-health. The poorer populations thus have to bear the brunt of the adverse environmental changes brought by development in additional to those brought by global climate change.

The baths are located on the south most part of the Hellenistic complex. They are directly west of the similarly dated Xenon, which served as athlete's lodging.  Dating of the site  Though the sanctuary has existed since the Archaic period, the baths are thought to have been built in the 4th century BC. This first approximation date was first proposed during the 1926 excavations given the position of the site. Subsequent finds seem to suggest that the construction of the baths were part of a larger 4th century monumentalization program at the site. An adjacent 4th century aqueduct that does not appear to feed the baths further supports a post 4th century date. Furthermore, a small Classical trench may be thought to suggest an earlier bath which once occupied the same site. Period pottery in the foundation also seems to correlate to the 4th century.  Physical description  The bath itself is divided between a west wing with a series of basins and an east wing with an open bath. Both of which are elevated and accessible beneath a flight of stairs. Under these stairs a terracotta pipe served to let drainage off to a small compartment and then to the river. The source of the water is a matter of contention and archaeological evidence has yet to produce a definitive answer. It is speculated to have come from a yet unknown aqueduct. Channels and reservoirs to leading the bath do survive and suggest a more complicated system than direct delivery. One postulation is that this was to allow the water to heat in the sun before being used in the baths, or else just control temperature.  Function  Along with the Xenon, the bath served as amenities to athletes during the Nemean games. The individual basin found in the west wing are typical general 4th century Greek baths, and are similar to those found at sites in Eretria and Corinth. They most likely functioned as personal bathing facilities to the Athletes during the games. The east wing's circular immersion bath or 'plunge bath' is remarkable as it is one of only four in Greece. Rather than a basin for the individual they seem to have some purpose in communal bathing. Curiously all four extant immersion baths have been found at Panhellenic athletic sites. Their function is not entirely clear, yet it does seem that they had some ritual or perhaps practical use unique to the Panhellenic games or else they would be more common to Athletic sites.  Disuse and later history  The bath seems to be used by the 1st century AD as evidenced by a layer of silt in the bath. This abandonment predates the end of the Nemean games in 275 AD, perhaps suggesting the general decline of the site. Through the end of the pagan context of the site it served as a trash heap. Early Christians turned the temple of Zeus into a Basilica in the 5th century AD and used the open chamber of the bath house as a repository for the dead; three burials have been found thus far.

A pupil of Darius Milhaud at the Conservatoire de Paris, he got interested in the music of Russian composer Alexander Scriabin, whose latest works (from Prometheus: The Poem of Fire to Mysterium) influenced his own compositions. His work on Scriabin and a certain esoteric aesthetic of music are authoritative.  Studies and publications  As a student of Darius Milhaud at the Conservatoire de Paris, Manfred Kelkel \\"always felt a sincere admiration and almost filial recognition for his former teacher, even if, aesthetically speaking, he followed a divergent path.\\". From 1969 onwards, the composer resumed his university studies, obtaining a doctoral degree and a State doctorate of music and musicology, \\"with works that have since become authoritative in their fields\\", from his study √Ä la recherche de la musique polyn√©sienne traditionnelle, in ethnomusicology, to State doctorate on lyrical music at the beginning of the 20th century (Naturalisme, v√©risme et r√©alisme dans l'op√©ra). His postgraduate thesis, dedicated to the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (Scriabine, sa vie, l'√©sot√©risme et le langage musical dans son ≈ìuvre), is a defining moment in his career. In his memories, Jacques Viret evokes a man \\"of perfect simplicity, modesty and affability\\", making him meet Marina Scriabin, daughter of the composer of the Mysterium, of which the Acte pr√©alable presents a twelve-tone tuning which carried him with enthusiasm. Among the many publications by Manfred Kelkel, Jean-Jacques Velly mainly retains the book Musique des mondes, published in 1988, \\"a unique work of its kind which synthesizes his two activities as a composer and musicologist.\\"  Teaching  Manfred Kelkel has held a number of important positions in music publishing and higher education. Music Director from 1957 to 1978 at , he was a lecturer at the Universities of Paris IV, Metz, Strasbourg II and Paris XII from 1974 to 1981, before being appointed professor at Lumi√®re University Lyon 2, from 1985 to 1991, the year he was appointed to Paris IV. Passionate about traditional Arabic music and early twentieth-century Russian music, he was the thesis director of Andr√© Lischke, himself a future specialist of Tchaikovsky's music and of The Mighty Handful.  Composition  Fascinated by oriental civilizations and occult practices, Manfred Kelkel decided on the basis of Tabula Smaragdina (referring to the Emerald Tablet), to apply to his compositions \\"in a rational and coherent manner, principles derived from Chinese esoterism, Arabic geomancy and the alchemical operations, playing on unsuspected correspondence between Buddhist mandalas, hermetic diagrams, magic squares and the art of sound\\". Jean-Jacques Velly undertook a brief analysis of his musical language. In the field of melody, writing is \\"governed by three essential elements: chromatic total, modal use of melody and the use of artificial symmetrical scales\\". In the harmonic domain, his work \\"draws inspiration from Scriabin's latest works and makes extensive use of chords that are more or less complex and close to the chromatic total\\", in a polytonality where \\"melody and harmony are articulated on solid landmarks, even if the resulting musical syntax has nothing in common with tonality in the narrow sense\\". \\"An admirer of Berlioz and the great Germanic orchestra school of the 19th century,\\" his orchestral writing \\"is distinguished by an emphasis on the instrumental timbre in which his musical thought immediately becomes part of his orchestral work.\\" In the field of orchestration, his mastery and originality were recognized very early on, in particular by Henri Dutilleux. Jacques Viret sees in Manfred Kelkel an \\"alchemist of sounds\\". In the field of rhythm, the science of the teacher and the composer come together in his scores. Philippe Reynal evokes a \\"real puzzle for students\\"!

History Origins The early history of banking on the Isle of Man is rife with incompetence and mismanagement. Whilst the earliest banks in England were an integral part of commerce as far back as the 12th century, banking was unknown on the Isle of Man until the beginning of the 19th century. The earliest Manx bank, Quayle's Bank, began business in 1802 at Castletown. It was known as the Isle of Man Bank and carried on trading until 1818.Isle of Man Daily Times. Tuesday, January 17, 1961; Page 3 A feature of Manx life at that time was a profusion of currency notes in circulation issued by tradesmen for small amounts. The Bankers' Notes Act 1817 was passed by Tynwald to control note issues. Five banking licences were issued under this law.The archives deposited in the Rolls Office reveal that in 1817 five banks were authorised to transact banking business and issue notes in the island; among them were John and Alexander Spittall, Gawne and McWhannell, Forbes Bank, and the better known Holmes' Bank. Operation The Isle of Man and Liverpool Banking Company commenced business at Douglas in 1836. It was wound up in May 1838, \\"from want of sufficient capital to carry on business in both places.\\"Manx Sun, Friday, May 18, 1838; Page 12 The Isle of Man and Liverpool Bank was succeeded by another company, the Isle of Man Commercial Bank, which in 1849 merged with the City of Glasgow Bank, carrying on its insular business as the Bank of Mona.

It was written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by Mark Bagley, and was the final comic book set in the Ultimate Marvel imprint. Plot Several heroes of the Ultimate Marvel and the mainstream Marvel universes are in the same city. In many cases, this means multiple versions of a same character. It is not clear what event caused it, but the Thor corps forbid any investigation or attempt to fix things. The conflict escalates into an open fight between the characters from both universes, which is stopped by Miles Morales. Morales explains that the universes have been merged and kept merged on purpose by the nigh-omnipotent Dr. Doom, as a punishment for the previous times the heroes had stopped him. The fight is halted, and the heroes of both universes prepare for a fight against Doom. Creation The Ultimate Marvel imprint was created in 2000, and lasted for 15 years. It had a fictional universe of its own, unconnected to the Marvel Universe of the rest of Marvel's comic books. The Secret Wars crossover was created to merge both universes into a single one, and end the imprint. Marvel PR's Chris D'Lando tasked it to writer Brian Michael Bendis and penciller Mark Bagley, who started the imprint with Ultimate Spider-Man. Bendis joked that he would hand the script soaked in tears. He said that the miniseries was not just a tie-in for Secret Wars, but an actual comic book event inside of another, and that it may have taken place anyway. He also pointed that he was glad that, with the miniseries, he could give a proper closure to the stories of most characters. The series was first announced with a teaser image by Bendis, titled \\"the end\\", and starring the main characters of the Ultimate Marvel imprint, such as Ultimate Spider-Man, X-Men and Nick Fury. However, the teaser was misleading at the time, as several miniseries titled \\"the end\\" had been published in recent years. The layout of the image was similar to the cover of the first issue of Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions, from 1982. The ending of the story features Miles Morales living in the mainstream Marvel Universe, setting up the new Spider-Man comic book. The cast of the Ultimate Spider-Man comics is kept as well, including Morales' mother, who had been killed in an older story arc. Reception Matt Little of CBR praised the fact that the miniseries could be understood easily as a stand-alone read, without requiring much familiarity with the Secret Wars main plot. He also welcomed the inclusion of the Ultimate versions of Cloak and Dagger, and pointed out the slow pace of the narrative, a common technique for Bendis.

He was a devout protestant and was friends with a number of notable protestant clerics of the time. Biography William Lambe was a London cloth merchant and philanthropist, was born at Sutton Valence, Kent, in 1495. According to Abraham Fleming, his contemporary biographer, Lambe rose from \\"a mean estate\\" in the countryside to become a gentleman of the Chapel Royal to Henry VIII., Modern Philology, Volume XVIII, Number 5, September 1920 for Thomas Turner (see British Library reference: BLL01001250923), and reprinted in 1875 at the instigation of Charles Frederick Angell, Master of the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers, 1858-9: see https://books.google.com/books?id=xLcxAQAAMAAJ He was admitted a freeman of the Clothworkers' Company in 1568, and served as master in 1569-70. In early life he lived in London Wall, next to the ancient hermitage chapel of St James's, belonging to the abbey of Gerendon in Leicestershire. Two monks of this community served the chapel as chaplains. A well belonging to them supplied its name to the adjoining Monkwell Street and Monkwell Square. Through his influence with the king Lambe purchased this chapel at the dissolution of the monasteries, by letters patent dated 30 March 34 Henry VIII (1542), and bequeathed it with his house, lands, and tenements, to the value of ¬£30 yearly, to the Company of Clothworkers. Out of this he directed that a minister should be engaged to perform divine service in his chapel every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday throughout the year, and to preach four sermons yearly before the members of the company, who were to attend in their gowns. The company were also to provide clothing for twenty-four poor men and women, and received ¬£4 yearly from the trust for their pains. Today there stands a plaque at 8-10, Moorgate, London, EC2 commemorating the fact that the land on which the property stands was in 1580 bequeathed by William Lambe to the Company of Clothworkers. Lambe's chapel, with the almshouses adjoining, was pulled down in 1825, and in 1872, under an act of 35 & 36 Vict. cap. 154, the chapel was finally removed to Prebend Square, Islington, where the present church of St James' was erected. At the west end of the church is a bust of the founder in his livery gown, with a purse in one hand and his gloves in the other (see photo). It bears the date 1612, and was removed from the chapel in London Wall. The William Lambe Trust survives to this day and helps provide for the maintenance of St James' Church, Islington. Lambe also built, at his own expense, a conduit in Holborn, and provided 120 buckets to enable poor women to gain a living by selling water. In 1577 Lambe paid ¬£1,500 to renovate an old conduit house at Oldbourne Crosse,, as reprinted in 1908 in a book edited by C.L. Kingsford and published by Clarendon, Oxford. See: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/survey-of-london-stow/1603 Snow Hill dating from 1498, using lead pipes to supply water from a dammed tributary of the River Fleet and adjacent springs via Leather Lane, although the importance of the conduit diminished when the New River opened in 1613 and the conduit was demolished in 1746. A public pump provided from this conduit in the vicinity of Long Yard gave its name to Lamb's Conduit Street, Lamb‚Äôs Conduit Passage and Lamb's Conduit Field, as well as to the nearby pub, The Lamb. Although the conduit has been gone for 200 years, there remains a stone plaque set into the wall at the entrance to Long Yard which reads: \\"Lamb's Conduit, the property of the City of London. This pump was erected for the benefit of the Publick [sic]\\" He also left an annuity of ¬£6 13s. 4d. to the Stationers' Company, to be distributed to the poor in St Faith's parish, besides other benefactions to St Giles', Cripplegate, Christ's and St Thomas's Hospitals, and the city prisons. For his native town of Sutton Valence he established in 1578, at his own expense, a free grammar school for the education of youth, providing a yearly allowance of ¬£20 for the master and ¬£10 for the usher, besides a good house and garden for the accommodation of the former. He also erected in the village of Town Sutton six almshouses, with an orchard and gardens, for the comfort of six poor inhabitants of that parish, and allotted the sum of ¬£2 to be paid to each of them yearly, entrusting the Company of Clothworkers with the estates and direction of these charities. He died 21 April 1580, and was buried in the church of St Faith under St Paul's. His tomb, which was destroyed with the church of St Faith in the Great Fire of London, bore a brass plate with figures of himself in armour and his three wives. His epitaph is printed by both William Camden, seventh edition as reprinted in 1870 in a book published by Chiswick Press (see p.418): see https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1sJAAAAQAAJ and William Dugdale: see https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=92ZZAAAAQAAJ and ran thus: As I was so be ye, As I am ye shall be: That I gave, that I have, That I spent, that I had: Thus I end all my cost, That I left, that I lost. The names of his wives were Joan, Alice, and Joan. The last survived him, and was buried in St. Olave's Church. Lambe was a strong adherent of the protestant faith and a friend of renowned protestant clerics Alexander Nowell and John Foxe. He was widely recognised for his piety and benevolence, and, according to his biographer, ‚Äú‚Äù  References  * 1495 births 1580 deaths British philanthropists British merchants People from the Borough of Maidstone Businesspeople from London Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal ","title":"William Lambe (philanthropist)"},{"id":"55171525","text":"The Chance 32/28 (also called the Chance 32) is a Canadian and French sailboat, that was designed by Naval Architect Britton Chance Jr. and first built in 1972.

It was undertaken by the Catholic Kingdom of France against the Cathars in southern France, who were regarded as a heretical sect. The Crusaders, led by French nobleman Simon de Montfort, besieged and captured the town. The Crusaders allowed the soldiers defending the town, along with any Catholics, and Cathars who had not yet reached the status of perfect to go free. Three Cathar perfects who repented were pardoned, but 140 others who refused to do so were burnt at the stake. Background The Albigensian Crusade was initiated by the Kingdom of France at the behest of Pope Innocent III. Its purpose was to squash the growing Cathar movement, which flourished mainly in the Languedoc region of southern France. The immediate cause was the killing of the papal legate, Pierre de Castelnau. The Crusaders set out in the summer of 1209. After several military victories, they were able to capture many towns without a fight before arriving at Minerve. After the fall of Carcassonne, papal legate Arnaud Amalric, who had led troops during the Massacre at B√©ziers, was replaced as commander of the Crusader force by Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, although Amalric continued to accompany the army. Minerve was a well-fortified city. It is located at the confluence of the Cesse and Brian rivers, which has cut deep ravines in the nearby area. It was also one of the largest towns in the Languedoc, situated near the Mediterranean coast. Minerve was a small castra deep in the mountains, and thus not of major strategic importance to the military. However, it had become an important place of refuge for Cathar perfectus and taking it would thus increase the authority of both Simon as count and the Catholic Church in the area, which seems to have influenced Simon's decision to attack the city. Siege In early June, the Crusader army besieged Minerve. The town was commanded by Lord Guilhem de Minerve. Unable to feed his army exclusively from the agricultural area around the town, Simon imported supplies from areas many miles away, such as Carcassonne. The steep gorges surrounding the town made it virtually impossible to storm. However, the gorges were also very narrow, making a bombardment more practical. Simon realized this and decided to use his artillery to capture Minerve. The Crusaders relied effectively upon siege equipment. Simon made his headquarters east of the town, where a crew lobbed heavy objects into the walls of the town. On the west, a rock thrower called a petraria (trebuchet) was used, in one of its earliest appearances in Europe. This machine, named mala vazina (\\"Bad Neighbor\\"), bombarded the town very heavily, partially destroying Guilhelm's home, and towards the end of June destroying the main wall of the city. The defenders held on for several more weeks, but the occupants began to run low on water. On July 22, the city surrendered. Laurence Marvin calls Simon's techniques an example of \\"a skillful use of siege warfare to take castles in geographically hostile conditions.\\" Simon and Guilhem de Minerve agreed to terms of surrender. However, Amalric, who had been absent at the time, returned to camp. He insisted that no agreements could be considered binding without the assent of himself as papal legate. Simon wished to treat the occupants leniently, but Amalric wanted them put to death. Eventually, the two worked out a solution. The Crusaders allowed the soldiers defending the town, as well as the Catholics inside of it, to leave. The Cathars who had not yet reached the status of perfect were also allowed to go free. The Cathar perfects were given the choice to return to Catholicism or face death. This solution angered many of the soldiers, who had wanted to participate in a massacre. Amalric calmed them by insisting that the majority of perfects would not recant. His prediction was correct. The soldiers entered the town singing Te Deum, while the Cathars, segregated male and female, knelt in prayer. The abbot Guy of Vaux-de-Cernay began to preach the Catholic faith to the men. He was interrupted and told, \\"We will have none of your faith. We have renounced the Church of Rome: your labor is in vain; for neither death nor life will make us renounce the opinions that we have embraced.\\" The abbot then went to the women, who even more stubbornly refused to convert. Simon also urged both groups to abandon their Cathar faith. \\"Be converted to the Catholic faith,\\" Simon said. Gesturing to the collection of dry wood that had been assembled, he continued, \\"Or ascend this pile.\\" Ultimately, only three women repented. The 140 people who refused were burned at the stake. Some Cathars chose to jump freely into the flames rather than wait for their executioners. Cistercian monk Peter of Vaux-de-Cernay records two miracles which allegedly took place during the Siege of Minerve. In one instance, a spring from which very little water flowed began to gush water shortly after the Crusaders arrived for the siege. Afterwards, it was reduced once again to a trickle. In the other, as the Crusaders were leaving, they set fire to all the huts which they had made out of branches and dry leaves. One hut, in which a priest had said Mass, while in close proximity to the others, was somehow spared from the flames. Aftermath After the Cathars had been burnt, their bodies were buried in shallow mud graves. The Crusaders continued their campaign against the Cathars, capturing many more towns. The Siege of Termes came directly after.

Plot Cairo, Egypt, 1917: During World War I, British Army Major Talbot storms into a crowded caf√© and demands that three Arab men vacate their table for him, ignoring the warnings of the young Captain Lawrence. One of the Arabs seizes Talbot's arm and warns that his foolish actions will have very unpleasant consequences, not just for him but for his whole family. Present Day: Harry Dresden, after narrowly surviving an encounter with a sea monster in Lake Michigan, returns to his office and is greeted by Prescott Tremaine, the Deputy Sheriff of Boone Mill, Missouri, who explains that Carl and Sarah Talbot ‚Äì the eldest of seven Talbot siblings ‚Äì were both killed by apparently supernatural means. Harry agrees to travel to the town. Harry confides to Prescott that supernatural killers love to gloat over their work as much as mortal serial killers do, so Prescott arranges for him to be present at the Talbots' funeral the next morning. The only unfamiliar face Prescott notices is a gravedigger, whom Harry's \\"sight\\" reveals to be a goblin. The goblin attacks Harry and avoids retaliation by grabbing Prescott's girlfriend, Ambre, as a hostage, before escaping. Harry consults with Bob, a \\"spirit of intellect\\" housed inside a skull, whose encyclopedic knowledge of magic and the spirit world includes the fact that the Talbot family is cursed; Major Talbot disappeared two weeks after the incident in the Cairo caf√©, and his body was found wrapped in a mummy sarcophagus in the British Museum.

He was a very impressive winner of his only race as a two-year-old but ran third on his only appearance at three. He emerged as a top-class middle-distance performer in 1980, winning the Westbury Stakes and the Brigadier Gerard Stakes in England before recording his biggest win in the Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes, which was then the only Group 1 in Ireland open to older horses. He also finished third in both the Eclipse Stakes and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in the United States. Background Gregorian was an \\"attractive, tall, lengthy\\" brown horse with a white star and snip bred in Florida by H T Mangurian Jr. As a yearling he was put up for auction and sold for $280,000. He was sent to race in Europe and entered training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. During his racing career he competed in the black and red colours of the Californian businessmen Danny Schwartz. His sire Graustark had a brief but promising racing career before becoming a very successful breeding stallion whose progeny included Prove Out, Key To The Mint, Avatar and Jim French. Gregorian's dam Natashka was a top- class performer on the track, winning the Alabama Stakes in 1966. She was even better as a broodmare, with her female-line descendants including Margarula, Elusive Quality, Dark Lomond and Questing. Racing career 1978: two- year-old season Gregorian made his first and only appearance as a two-year- old in a maiden race over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse in October. Starting the 2/5 favourite against eighteen opponents he took the lead in the straight and accelerated away from the field to win by twelve lengths. The independent Timeform gave Gregorian a rating of 115 p, the \\"p\\" indicating that he was expected to make more than usual improvement, and commented that \\"a lot more will be heard from him\\". 1979: three-year-old season In April 1979 Gregorian started odds-on favourite for the Ballymoss Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh. Racing on soft ground he never looked likely to win and finished a distant third of the seven runners behind Dickens Hill and the five-year-old Orchestra. He did not race again in 1979. 1980: four-year-old season After finishing unplaced over seven furlongs on his four-year-old debut, Gregorian was sent to England for the Group 3 Westbury Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse in April. Ridden by Lester Piggott he started at odds of 11/4 and won by three lengths from Prince Rheingold. Over the same course and distance a month later, with Piggott again in the saddle, he added a win in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes, beating Noelino by three lengths having led from the start. Gregorian was back again at Sandown in July and was moved up to the highest level for the Group 1 Eclipse Stakes. He got the better of Sea Chimes in a struggle for the lead and turned into the straight with a clear advantage but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Ela-Mana-Mou and Hello Gorgeous. The colt was then dropped in class and started favourite for the Royal Whip Stakes at the Curragh but ran poorly and was beaten into third place by the five-year-old mare My Hollow. When the colt returned to England for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse he was ridden by Tommy Murphy as Piggott opted to partner the filly Mrs Penny. He finished third to Ela-Mana- Mou and Mrs Penny, tracking the leaders for most of the way and staying on well in the straight. Having raced over one and a half miles in his last two starts, Gregorian was dropped back in distance to contest the fifth running of the Joe McGrath Memorial over ten furlongs at Leopardstown on 20 September and was made the 11/4 favourite against ten opponents including his stablemates Gonzales and Night Alert (winner of the Prix Jean Prat). The other fancied runners were Corvaro (Prix Eug√®ne Adam) from France, Cracaval (Chester Vase) from England and the filly Racquette (third in The Oaks). The favourite was subject to a late jockey change with Tommy Murphy, having broken his ankle in the previous race, being replaced by George McGrath. Gregorian disputed the lead from the start and had a clear advantage three furlongs out. In the closing stages he was challenged and headed by the 40/1 outsider Spence Bay but rallied to regain the lead in the final strides and won by a short head. He did not run again and was retired from racing at the end of the year. In the official International Classification for 1980, Gregorian was give a rating of 83, seven pounds behind the top older horse Ela-Mana-Mou. He was rated the second best Irish-trained older horse, three pounds behind the stayer Ardross. Timeform gave him a rating of 124. In their annual Racehorses of 1980 they noted that he had a tendency to swish his tail when under pressure but described him as \\"game and genuine\\". Stud record Gregorian began his career as a breeding stallion at Windfields Farm in Maryland in 1981.

The term implies a mumbling or unclear vocal delivery by artists, and may generally refer to rappers who do not share the genre's typical emphasis on lyricism. While the term has been widely criticized as inaccurate or as a derogatory term, some artists have reclaimed the term. Others have defended the style as a new phase in the evolution of the genre.  Style and etymology  The term \\"mumble rap\\" was first used in 2014 by VladTV battle rap journalist Michael Hughes, in an interview with battle rapper Loaded Lux about the style's emergence in mainstream hip hop.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E_qHB1PwXc There is disagreement over who first rapped in such a style, although its creation has been attributed to rappers such as Gucci Mane, Chief Keef, and most notably Future, whose 2011 single \\"Tony Montana\\" is often cited as the first mumble rap song. The term was first used to describe rappers whose lyrics were unclear, but the use of the term has expanded to include rappers that Reddit posters and YouTube commenters claim generally put little emphasis on lyricism or lyrical quality. Some have claimed that artists such as Das EFX and Fu-Schnickens rapped in a similar style years before the term was created. \\"Mumble rappers\\" tend to talk about drugs, sex, money, jewelry, designer clothing, and partying. Rappers labelled as \\"mumble rappers\\" also tend to use the \\"aye\\" flow, where they add words such as \\"yeah\\", \\"aye\\" and \\"uh\\" to the start or end of their lines. \\"Mumble rap\\" is nearly exclusively used as a derogatory term in reference to a perceived incoherence of the artist's lyrics. Oscar Harold of the Cardinal Times stated that \\"mumble rap\\" is misleading, arguing that the rappers such as Future rely more upon pop melodies and vocal effects, such as Auto-Tune, than mumbling. Justin Charity, a staff writer at The Ringer, argues that the term is unnecessarily reductive and does not in fact refer to one specific type of rapping. He wrote that many of the artists often scapegoated in conversations about the subgenre do not actually mumble, which \\"is the red flag that the term isn't a useful subcategorization.\\" There are disputes as to whether some rappers are mumble rappers or not. There is also conflation between mumble/SoundCloud rap and other new generation-led evolutions or niches such as trap and cloud rap. The Cleveland Plain Dealer's Troy L. Smith writes that 21 Savage unfairly gets classified as a mumble rapper.  SoundCloud rap scene  In 2017, music critic Jon Caramanica of The New York Times opined that SoundCloud rap \\"in the last year has become the most vital and disruptive new movement in hip-hop\\". Todd Moscowitz, the founder of Alamo Records, called the scene a \\"lo-fi movement\\" noting the heavily distorted bass and intentional lack of polish in the sound. When Ski Mask the Slump God discussed the lo-fi's genre's sound and recording techniques, he noted that \\"It was like the worst recording set up, [but] you could set it up anywhere and that was the wave we were on,\\" and \\"The raw energy of that ‚Äì the distortion ‚Äì is our speciality and we used that to our advantage.\\" Spin noted that the SoundCloud company has not been able to leverage the popularity of SoundCloud rap to improve its financial problems. In January 2019, citing the deaths of rappers Lil Peep in 2017 and XXXTentacion in 2018, Lil Xan's entry into rehab, and 6ix9ine's legal troubles, Stephen Witt of Rolling Stone magazine argued that the SoundCloud rap wave of the past few years was now in decline. Reception Criticism Rappers who have voiced discontent with mumble rap include J. Cole, Logic, Chris Webby, Russ, Joyner Lucas, and Eminem. On his album Kamikaze, Eminem criticized multiple \\"mumble rappers\\" after declaring that \\"The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap\\" in the Royce da 5'9\\" song \\"Caterpillar\\". Eminem's diss track \\"Killshot\\", which was targeted at Machine Gun Kelly, included a line where he pejoratively called MGK a mumble rapper. Noted rap artist Pete Rock prominently criticized the style for abandoning hip-hop tradition. In music critic Robert Christgau's opinion, \\"SoundCloud rap is at least as afflicted as any other kind of hip hop with sexist rhetoric I need very good reasons to hear past.\\" He added, \\"I'm way sick of the word 'bitch'\\", particularly disliking XXXTentacion's music for these reasons. Praise In defense of the style, Justin Charity of The Ringer suggested that the debate is \\"really about discomfort with how a generation of young musicians has chosen to use their voices in strange, unprecedented ways, and against the wishes of their parents and forefathers.\\" The Guardian compared the style to the first wave of punk, noting a shared \\"sonic simplicity, gleeful inanity and sense of transgression.\\" The Vibe linked mumble rap to earlier forms of hip-hop, as well as jazz scatting. For The Conversation, Adam de Paor-Evans disputed the idea that mumble rap is a reflection of laziness, suggesting instead that it is an accurate reflection of boredom resulting from the immediacy and speed of contemporary cultural life.\\" Red Bull Music Academy stated that \\"however they're labeled ‚Äî SoundCloud rap, emo-trap, mumble rap ‚Äî one thing's for sure: these rappers are forging new paths, once again pushing the boundaries of what rap is, who it's for and how it's distributed.\\" Rap pioneer Grandmaster Caz expressed acceptance of the style, stating \\"It's all good [...] they're a different generation, they do a different thing, they have a different agenda and their influences come from different places.\\" Funk pioneer George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic declared himself a listener of mumble rap, stating \\"we try to pay attention to whatever the new music is that gets on your nerves.\\" Podcaster and television host The Kid Mero dismisses criticisms of the style, stating: \\"sonically if your shit is wack, why am I gonna listen to what you gotta say?

Jones, compiler of the first hymn and tune book ever used and made popular in the United States, was of Welsh descent. Her mother, Ann Letts, was a woman of great natural gifts, both of voice and mind, and a regular contributor to the literature of the day. The daughter inherited in a marked degree their musical talent. When but a very little girl, she studied the elements of music under her father and began piano lessons when seven years old. At an early age she surprised her friends by carrying the alto in part-singing, \\"making it up\\" with wonderful correctness. At fifteen she was obliged to begin to earn her living by teaching piano. At the same time her musical studies were faithfully carried on under the best masters. Vocal lessons were begun at that time and she made rapid progress in florid singing. Her last year in the East was spent with the best vocal teachers in Boston. Career In 1855 Kate Jones moved to Chicago and there became quite noted as a vocalist In 1858 she was married to Ira Shaler Brainard (1825-1910), and in 1865 moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where she was looked upon as one of the leading sopranos, receiving a large salary in one of the choirs. In 1866 Brainard assumed charge of the music in Mary Institute, the female department of Washington University, numbering at the time nearly four-hundred girls. Brainard's class-work, as systematized and developed in that institute, was remarkable. During her career in Mary Institute she frequently spent her vacations in the East with some prominent teacher, to obtain new ideas for her work. Among these was a trip to Europe, where she studied in Paris and London with Pauline Viardot, Manuel Garcia and Charlotte Sainton-Dolby. Many girls with promising voices had been started on their musical career by Brainard. For twenty-five years her name was associated with the progress of musical art in St. Louis, and many singers referred to her as their conscientious guide during their struggles and studies. She was deeply and actively interested in church work since she was thirteen years old, at which time she united with Dr. Hatfield's church in New York City. She died on January 14, 1918 in St. Louis and was cremated.

Within the organization of the National Archives, the upkeep of its facilities falls under the National Archives Facilities and Property Management Office.  National Archives Building  The National Archives Building from Constitution Avenue The National Archives Building, known informally as Archives I, located north of the National Mall on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C., opened as its original headquarters in 1935. It holds the original copies of the three main formative documents of the United States and its government: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. It also hosts a copy of the 1297 Magna Carta confirmed by Edward I. These are displayed to the public in the main chamber of the National Archives, which is called the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom. The National Archives Building also exhibits other important American historical documents such as the Louisiana Purchase Treaty, the Emancipation Proclamation, and collections of photography and other historically and culturally significant American artifacts. Once inside the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom, there are no lines to see the individual documents and visitors are allowed to walk from document to document as they wish. For over 30 years the National Archives have forbidden flash photography but the advent of cameras with automatic flashes have made the rules increasingly difficult to enforce. As a result, all filming, photographing, and videotaping by the public in the exhibition areas has been prohibited since February 25, 2010. An Innovation Hub provides facilities for the public to access NARA documents and provide metadata. Historical records of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate are available for research at NARA's Center for Legislative Archives.About the Center for Legislative Archives at nara.gov National Archives at College Park NARA facility near the University of Maryland, College Park Because of space constraints, NARA opened a second facility, known informally as \\"Archives II\\", in 1994 near the University of Maryland, College Park campus (8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD, 20740-6001). Largely because of this proximity, NARA and the University of Maryland engage in cooperative initiatives. The College Park campus includes an archaeological site that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Washington National Records Center The Washington National Records Center (WNRC), located in Suitland, Maryland is a large warehouse type facility which stores federal records which are still under the control of the creating agency. Federal government agencies pay a yearly fee for storage at the facility. In accordance with federal records schedules, documents at WNRC are transferred to the legal custody of the National Archives after a certain point (this usually involves a relocation of the records to College Park). Temporary records at WNRC are either retained for a fee or destroyed after retention times has elapsed. WNRC also offers research services and maintains a small research room. National Personnel Records Center Two offices in the St. Louis, Missouri area comprise the National Personnel Records Center. * Spanish Lake, Missouri, Military Personnel Records Center * Valmeyer, Illinois, Civilian Personnel Records Center, Regional facilities The National Archives at Atlanta facility in Morrow, Georgia There are facilities across the country with research rooms, archival holdings, and microfilms of documents of federal agencies and courts pertinent to each region. * Atlanta, Georgia, located in Morrow, Georgia * Boston, Massachusetts, NARA at Boston is located in Waltham, Massachusetts * Chicago, Illinois * Denver, Colorado, NARA at Denver is located in Broomfield, Colorado * Fort Worth, Texas * Kansas City, Missouri * New York City, New York * Philadelphia, Pennsylvania * Riverside, California * San Francisco, California * Seattle, Washington (National Archives at Seattle) A regional office in Anchorage, Alaska was closed in 2014 with records for the region transferred to Seattle, Washington. The Seattle facility is planned to be closed by a decision of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in January 2020, with records moved to California and Kansas City. Federal Records Centers Federal Records Centers exist in each region that house materials owned by federal government agencies. Federal Records Centers are not open for public research but, in many cases, may be housed in the same complex or building as a National Archives regional office. The federal records centers (FRCs) are also administratively divided into two archival divisions. Division East * Atlanta FRC * Boston FRC * Chicago FRC * Dayton FRC * Dayton Kingsridge FRC * Fort Worth FRC * Philadelphia FRC * Pittsfield FRC Division West * Kansas City FRC * Lee's Summit FRC * Riverside FRC * San Bruno FRC * Seattle FRC The Director of the Federal Records Center Program is considered one of the primary office chiefs in the National Archives Executive for Agency Services. The federal records center program is headquartered at the National Archives at College Park. Both the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) and the Washington National Records Center (WNRC) are considered part of the federal records center program. Lenexa Federal Records Center The Federal Records Center in Lenexa, Kansas is a large underground complex which contains storage vaults for records and artifacts. The center is perhaps best known for holding items from the treatment of John F. Kennedy after his fatal shooting in 1963, including the blood stained dress of Jacqueline Kennedy as well as the hospital gurney on which President Kennedy was pronounced dead. Presidential libraries The Truman Presidential Library NARA also maintains the Presidential Library system, a nationwide network of libraries for preserving and making available the documents of U.S. presidents since Herbert Hoover. The Presidential Libraries include: * Herbert Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa * Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library in Hyde Park, New York * Harry S. Truman Presidential Library in Independence, Missouri * Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas * John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts * Lyndon B.

The National Archives is considered an independent federal government agency, receiving this status in 1985 after existing under the General Services Administration since the National Archives' founding in 1934. Senior leadership The National Archives is overseen by its chief official, the Archivist of the United States who is a political appointee of the President but is not a member of the cabinet. The current Archivist of the United States is David Ferriero. The Archivist is directly assisted by the Deputy Archivist of the United States who acts a second in command of the National Archives. The current deputy archivist is Debra Steidel Wall. Directly reporting to the Archivist of the United States are the chiefs of the four main Archival offices. These are the: * Chief of Staff * Chief Innovation Officer * Chief of Management and Administration * Chief Operating Officer The National Archives Executive Secretariat is an internal office reporting to the Chief of Staff. Also reporting to the Archivist of the United States are several independent branches of the National Archives which operate with autonomy concerning their respective areas of expertise. These are the: * NARA Inspector General * Office of Equal Employment Opportunity * National Archives General Counsel * Office of Congressional Affairs The Archivist of the United States also serves as Chairman of the National Historical Publications and Records Commission.

Business services The National Archives Business Support Services Office is concerned primarily with physical maintenance and upkeep of National Archives facilities. The office maintains two administrative branches known as the \\"Administrative Policy and Planning Division\\" and the \\"Storage Coordination and Logistics Office\\". Two major sub-offices are the \\"National Archives Security Management Office\\", concerned with physical security at NARA sites and buildings, and the \\"Facility and Property Management Office\\" which oversees repairs, cleaning, and upkeep of facilities. Both of these offices make heavy use of subcontractors to include private custodial companies as well as contracted security guards. In 2015, the security company contracted to guard the Washington National Records Center, located on the same federal complex as the United States Census Bureau, suffered the death of a guard when a shooter opened fire in the early evening. The death lead to renewed scrutiny on how the National Archives handles security, specifically that many of its buildings are privately guarded and not under the auspices of the Federal Protection Police.Greene, J.C. \\"Guard Dead After Shooting at U.S. Census Bureau Headquarters\\", Washington Post (17 Apr 2015) Human resources Staffing needs and recruitment are overseen by the Chief of Human Capitol, although the actual advertisement of positions and hiring is conducted through the Office of Personnel Management.

The station was founded in January 2017 by Hugh Evans (Moose), Russ Collington (Dewsbury), Peter 'Pete' Bailey and Benjamin 'Mark' Woodhouse, all formerly of Team Rock. Through the loyalty of their fan base, the company hit its first major milestone in July 2017, successfully crowd equity funding ¬£153,282 from 853 individual investors. Test streams of the radio station began in May 2017 and the station officially launched on Saturday 30 September 2017 at 7pm. History A predecessor in the same market was Team Rock, a company based in London and High Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, which published music magazines and operated an online radio station. Team Rock was placed in administration on 19 December 2016, with all employees made redundant and the radio station taken offline. This presented to Hugh Evans (Moose) an opportunity to create a station that would bring the rock music community together and ultimately be controlled by that community. Evans brought Russ Collington (Dewsbury), Peter 'Pete' Bailey and Benjamin 'Mark' Woodhouse on board to start building a new business. In order to enable the community to have a controlling stake and sense of ownership in the business, the founders proposed the sale of an initial 13.27% share in the business through the equity funding company Seedrs. The target fund required for this share was ¬£130,012. On 5 July 2017, the fund hit its target. On 15 July, the fund closed with ¬£153,282 raised from 853 individual investors. Primordial Radio went live on Saturday 30 September 2017, after a period of test streams. Since that date the station's presented content is subscription- only, at a price of ¬£5.99 per month or ¬£60 annually, with an initial month's free trial. Alongside the radio ventures, the company runs events, sells merchandise and has its own beer, brewed in conjunction with Pig and Porter Brewery. The beer, Primordial S√ºp, was launched on 18 July 2017 in London at The Lexington. An established event is The Primordial Radio Pub quiz, where online teams around the world play a live pub quiz through an interactive stream. On 11 January 2018, it was announced the first Annual General Meeting of FT Industries Ltd, holding company of Primordial Radio, would be held in Lincoln at the Lincolnshire Show Ground on Saturday 21 April 2018. The official post-AGM event #Drinkininlincoln took place in the evening, featuring live performances from Big Boy Bloater and the Limits, Massive Wagons and The Virginmarys. On 20 August 2018, in a world first, Moose broadcast his breakfast show from an altitude of 35,000 ft on flight WS22 from Vancouver International Airport, Canada to Gatwick Airport, United Kingdom. Moose was able to successfully broadcast the show using only his iPhone 6, a microphone and the WiFi facilities aboard the WestJet Boeing 767 flight. This was built on his previous success broadcasting a show whilst travelling across London using the London Underground transport system as part of the Moose and JRock breakfast show on Team Rock Radio in 2015. In a UK first for a radio station, Primordial Radio announced on 6 September 2018 they had secured a deal with Vodafone to have unlimited data usage through their official app with the Vodafone Music Pass. On 6 October 2018, Massive Wagons and Evil Scarecrow were announced by Primordial Radio as the headliners of the Primordial Radio Annual General Mayhem, which takes place on Saturday 27 April 2019 after the company's second AGM. Skarlett Riot were next to be announced to play the Annual General Mayhem, quickly followed by Millie Manders and The Shut Up. After previously announcing at the First AGM event Primordial Radio had a tartan design registered, Primordial Radio launched The Pride of Primordial on 24 January 2019. To mark the occasion, Primordial Radio hosted a Burns Supper in Edinburgh on 25 January 2019.  Future plans  The company wishes to push the boundaries of radio broadcasting by developing the ability for the listener to choose their own music in and around the presenter‚Äôs content. By tracking listener's habits and preferences, they will be able to have presented radio, whilst listening to their own unique radio stream. The service offers music streaming akin to Spotify and the ability to choose like Tinder; all with presenter interactions of a radio station. Alongside this functionality, the station will continue to have a linear based radio station, where the DJ's have control of the music.

Woodin Le Valley, A woman of the century Laura Anna Woodin Le Valley (1853 - December 9, 1918) was an American lawyer. Early life and family Laura Anna Woodin was born in Granville, New York, and was the only daughter of Daniel Woodin (d. 1883) and Sarah J.S. Palmer. Daniel Woodin was born in Oswego County, New York, about the year 1820. He was a tutor in the North Granvill Academy, New York, and in 1845 went to Michigan. He was a teacher for about twenty years and was for many years School Inspector of Macomb County, Michigan. He was elected Justice of Peace for three successive terms, which office he held at the time of his death. Her girlhood was spent in Romeo, Michigan, where she attended an institute of that place, and afterwards she became a student in Falley Seminary, Fulton, New York. She made a specialty of music, and entered Sherwood's Musical Academy, Lyons, New York, from which she was graduated. Career Soon after graduation, Laura A. Woodin Le Valley gained the reputation of a thorough instructor in instrumental music. Finding her services in demand in her father's office, she was appointed a notary public, and assisted him for several years, especially in the prosecution of United States claims. During that time she had much business experience and began the study of stenography. She commenced to study law, and, encouraged by her father, entered the law department of the University of Michigan in the fall of 1880, from which she was graduated in the class of 1882. She was a faithful student, made rapid progress, and had barely entered upon the work of the senior year, when she applied for admission to the bar, stood a rigid examination in open court, and was admitted to practice before the supreme court of Michigan on November 12, 1881. LeValley was a member of the Congregational Church, and for years was an active worker in the Sunday-school of that denomination. Personal life In the law school Laura A. Woodin first met her future husband, David W. LeValley, from the State of New York, then a senior in the law department in the class of 1881.

It taught elementary students from the local community for 81 years. Graymont Elementary was the first school in the Birmingham system to be integrated. It was constructed in a classical style by William Spink. It later became part of the Birmingham City Schools system. Located at 300 8th Avenue West in what is now the Smithfield neighborhood, it was closed in 1989, after it was determined that the school was redundant to Hill Elementary School nearby. In the mid 1990s, the vacant former school was restored and adapted for the offices of the Jefferson County Committee for Economic Opportunity (JCCEO), which operates federally-funded social programs such as pre-kindergarten, adult day care, substance abuse, nutrition, utility assistance, job training, residential weatherization, and family counseling. JCCEO also operates the Arrington Head Start Center, home of Alabama's first public pre-K classroom, from here. In 2007 Graymont Elementary School was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Desegregation   Armstrong v. Birmingham Board of Education  In 1960, James Armstrong, a local black barber, along with his two sons Dwight and Floyd filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Armstrong v. Birmingham Board of Education was a class-action lawsuit filed to desegregate the schools of Birmingham. This case spanned from 1960 through 1983. = Case profile = : \\"On May 28, 1963, Judge Seybourne Lynne denied injunctive relief, requiring the plaintiffs to exhaust the supposed remedies offered by the Alabama School Placement Law (a school choice law), following a course that it saw proper after the Supreme Court affirmed the decision in Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham Board of Education, upholding as facially constitutional the Alabama School Placement Law.\\" : \\"The plaintiffs appealed Judge Lynne's decision to the Fifth Circuit, also asking for an injunction pending appeal, which they were granted. In that opinion, the court of appeals held that the plaintiffs did not have to exhaust potential remedies under the state law before seeking relief in the federal courts. The injunction ordered the Board and the Superintendent to submit a plan to the court for desegregation by August 19, 1963.\\" : \\"On September 4, 1963, the first day of the new school year, Armstrong showed up with two of his children to register them at a previously all-white school.\\" : \\"On June 18, 1964, the Fifth Circuit ruled on the merits of plaintiffs' appeal. The court vacated the district court's order denying injunctive relief and remanded it with instructions to require the school board to present a desegregation plan that met certain minimum standards across elementary, middle and high school. The court noted that after the earlier Court of Appeals decision, the Board had submitted an inadequate plan that did little beyond continue to accept voluntary transfers.\\" : \\"According to news reports, Judge Guin dismissed the desegregation suit against Birmingham in 1983.\\"  Aftermath of desegregation  Floyd Armstrong, age 11, and his brother Dwight, age 10, were enrolled by their father on September 4, 1963. That same night a bomb exploded at the home of Arthur Shores, a local civil rights activist, causing the school system to close temporarily. Three black students were also transferring to all-white Ramsey High School and West End High School in Birmingham. When schools reopened on September 9, brothers Floyd and Dwight were on their way back to Graymont Elementary with their father James and the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth and attorneys fighting for integration. Alabama state troopers acted under orders from Governor George Wallace to prevent the children from entering the schools - the boys were turned away at the door. President John F. Kennedy responded by sending the Alabama National Guard to escort the black student transfers into West End High School and Ramsay High School on September 10. Floyd and Dwight attended class for the first time at Graymont Elementary on September 10. On Wednesday September 11, police continued to push back demonstrators at West End and Ramsay. Graymont, however, was peaceful. Four days later, the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed, killing four young girls. In 2013, in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the segregation of the Birmingham city schools, Dwight Armstrong remembered those early days. \\"The staff was exemplary. One of their main objectives was to make sure we stayed safe. The majority of the students were just curious. I think they had a sense of being part of history themselves.\\" A few \\"knuckleheads\\" ‚Äî as Armstrong called them ‚Äî caused problems and hurled insults at the white children who came too close to being friendly and stared the brothers down as they walked the halls.

He was educated by private tutor at home and was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge on 3 April 1738 and at Inner Temple on 18 November 1741. Political career Vyner was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Okehampton as the Duke of Bedford's candidate in the 1754 general election. He did not stand in 1762 and was defeated at Lincoln in the 1768 general election. He married Eleanor Anderson, daughter of Thomas Carter of Redbourne, Lincolnsire, and widow of Francis Anderson on 5 May 1768. She was the mother of Charles Anderson-Pelham and Francis Evelyn Anderson who both joined him in Parliament. In 1774 Vyner was elected MP for Lincoln after a contest. He retained his seat at Lincoln at the 1780 general election. The English Chronicle wrote about him in 1781 as follows. ‚ÄúHe enjoys an estate of eight or ten thousand a year in Lincolnshire, is generally esteemed proud and imperious to inferiors, notwithstanding the apparent softness of his interior contexture in the House, and is not at all popular even in the place he represents.‚Äù Vyner did not seek re-election at Lincoln in 1784 but instead was returned as MP for Thirsk on the Frankland interest at by-election in 1785.

Bounds had been a nominee for a position as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Already controversial, the nomination lost bipartisan support for confirmation in the Senate when it was revealed that, as an undergraduate, Bounds wrote columns criticizing outrage over vandalism of a gay pride statue, arguing student efforts to promote racial diversity in fact entrench racial intolerance, suggesting multicultural campus groups were in reality an effort to extort the university, and asserting \\"there is nothing really inherently wrong with the University failing to punish an alleged rapist‚Äîregardless his guilt‚Äîin the absence of adequate certainty,\\" among other things. In July 2018, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the president would withdraw the nomination.  Biography  Bounds earned his Bachelor of Arts in psychology and political science, with honors and distinction, from Stanford University and his Juris Doctor from Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal and editor-in-chief of the Yale Law & Policy Review. Early in his career, Bounds served as a law clerk to Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Chief of Staff in the Office of Legal Policy at the United States Department of Justice. He also previously served as Special Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, acting as the White House's primary policy expert on criminal and civil justice issues. Before becoming a special prosecutor he served as Special Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. He currently serves as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Oregon, where he prosecutes criminal cases on behalf of the United States.  Failed nomination to U.S. Court of Appeals  On September 7, 2017, President Trump nominated Bounds to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, to the seat vacated by Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, who assumed senior status on December 31, 2016. One week after Bounds was nominated, both of Oregon's U.S. Senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, announced they would not return the Senate Blue slips for Bounds, saying they had not been adequately consulted on the nomination. The White House Counsel's Office said that it had contacted both senators on several occasions before nominating Bounds, but received very little feedback from either senator. On January 3, 2018, Bounds's nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the United States Senate. On January 5, 2018, President Donald Trump announced his intent to renominate Bounds to a federal judgeship. On January 8, 2018, his renomination was sent to the Senate. In February 2018, the bipartisan commission cited by Wyden and Merkley found Bounds to be one of four suitable applicants for the judgeship. However, the Senators continued to refuse to turn in their blue slips, citing college newspaper articles Bounds wrote while a student at Stanford University in the 1990s. On May 9, 2018, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On June 7, 2018, his nomination was reported out of committee by an 11‚Äì10 party- line vote. On July 18, 2018, the Senate voted 50‚Äì49 to invoke cloture on his nomination. On July 19, 2018, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that Bounds‚Äôs nomination would be withdrawn after Senator Tim Scott, a Republican, announced he could not support the nomination with the information he had at that point; Scott's stance left Bounds's nomination short of the number of votes needed for confirmation. Scott is the first African American to be elected to the Senate from the Deep South since the 19th Century. On July 24, 2018, the Bounds nomination was officially withdrawn. Prior to his nomination, Bounds did not disclose controversial columns written by him in The Stanford Review about campus sexual assault, workers' rights, ethnic minorities and gender discrimination to the Oregon judicial selection committee convened by the state's congressional delegation. Bounds said he was instructed to provide only material dating back to law school to the selection committee by a staffer of Senator Ron Wyden, who had helped to convene the commission. He did, however, provide those writings to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.

Found in the northern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, it occurs from the lower shore down to about , on sand or gravel. Description T. superbus grows to a length of or more but is only about wide. It has a rounded head and a firm, cylindrical body, gradually decreasing in diameter to a bluntly pointed tail. The colouring is distinctive, being bright red, reddish-brown or dark brown with white or yellowish lines along the mid-dorsal, lateral and mid-ventral surfaces, and white rings girdling the body; the front three rings are widely spaced while the hinder ones are more closely packed together. There are a pair of sensory organs on the sides of the worm near the front of the body, but no cephalic glands (mucus secreting glands) on the head in this species. This worm is similar in appearance to Tubulanus annulatus, but that species lacks the white line along the ventral surface. Tubulanus superbus is often surrounded by a mucoid sheath to which sand and other fragments adhere. Distribution and habitat This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, where its range extends from Greenland and Scandinavia southwards to the British Isles, the Atlantic coast of France and the Mediterranean Sea. Although sometimes found intertidally, it is more commonly found in soft sediments such as sand and gravel dredged up from the seabed, where it lives at depths of or more. Ecology A predator, scavenger and omnivore, T. superbus glides by cilliary action over the seabed on a trail of slime. On encountering prey, the proboscis is everted (turned inside out) through a pore near the snout. The proboscis winds around the prey and mucus and toxic secretions immobilise it. It is then passed to the mouth and swallowed whole, or if too large, digestive juices are secreted onto it and the semi-digested tissues are sucked into the mouth.
