History The Mindoro State University (MinSu) was originally the Mindoro National Agricultural School (MINAS) created by R.A. 506 as a national agricultural secondary public school in the island of Mindoro. It formally opened its doors for learning on August 26, 1951. In 1963, by authority of R.A. 3758, it opened the Collegiate Department. This steered the offering of several collegiate courses. The first two years leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) was initially offered. This was followed by the two-year course leading to Associate in Agricultural Technology (AAT) in 1973, then the complete course offering of Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Education (BSAE) in 1975 and the BSA curriculum developed by the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE) based at Los Ba√±os, Laguna was adopted by the school. This gradually replaced the BSA curriculum as well as the BSAE. The continued offering of Collegiate courses, in addition to the secondary curriculum which was offered since the founding of the school made MINAS a full-fledged college hence; the change of name from MINAS to MCAT was approved on June 10, 1976 by then Secretary Juan L. Manuel of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports. It was converted in State University and is now MinSu by virtue of R.A. 8007 on May 25, 1995. Virgilio C. Juan became the principal of the Victoria campus and is a well-known parliamentarian and author. His work on parliamentary procedure was circulated in the different parts of Philippines and became the basis for regional competition on parliamentary procedure. Having a curriculum patterned from UP Los Banos, students can easily transferred to UPLB after two years if they had able to maintain good scholastic standing. On June 25, 2018, presentation of candidates for president was held at MinSCAT Calapan City Campus. The 4 candidates were Dr. Jake B. Labrador from Lyceum of the Philippines in Batangas, Dr. Rene Colocar of City College of Calapan, Dr. Levy B. Arago, Jr. of MinSCAT Main Campus and Dr. Katherine S.

Its main campus is located in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro.Philippine Batas Pambansa Bilang. 531 OMSC began as a barangay high school founded in 1966 and is now a full-fledged state college with five campuses catering to more than eight thousand students of the province and nearby municipalities. The current presidents are Dr. Arnold N. Venturina and Dr. James Kordance. History left Occidental Mindoro State College was established as Barrio High School in 1966. The idea that the school should be shaped after Pedro Orata‚Äôs Barangay High School was conceived by then Mayor Juan G. Santos, Sr., who was also the PTA President of San Jose Pilot Elementary School. The concept was carried out by Sofronio Fadre, Schools Division Superintendent, and Mariano Ramirez, East District Supervisor. Mayor Tirso Abedela approved Resolution No. 23 in 1967, establishing the self-supporting public secondary school as San Jose Municipal High School.http://www.omsc.edu.ph/index.php/about-omsc Elevation to State College San Jose Municipal High School was elevated to San Jose National High School (SJNHS) by Republic Act No. 6568, sponsored by Congressman Pedro C. Medalla, Sr. Bernabe Macaraig was appointed as the school's first principal. Upon the school's elevation, attendance exceeded 3,000 students. SJNHS has elevated again to Occidental Mindoro State College on 24 June 1983. This was due by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 531 as amended by Republic Act No. 9747, which was sponsored by Congressman Pedro T. Mendiola, Sr. The first superintendent of the school was Macaraig. Mamburao campus and service areas Education, Culture and Sports Minister, Lourdes R. Quisumbing appointed Virginia A. Sicat, who was then assistant principal of the OMSC, as officer-in-charge of the institution on 1 April 1986. Ofelia A. Rebong was also appointed as the first president of the college in the same year. Rebong's term was seven years long and staff development was infocus during this period. OMSC expanded in the 1991-92 school year, with the absorption of Occidental Mindoro Community College in Mamburao by the state college. The community college became a satellite campus of the OMSC and became known as the OMSC-Mamburao Campus, which offers baccalaureate and non-degree courses. A plot owned by the Organization for the International Scientific and Cultural Advancement (OISCA) was also acquired by the state college through the Provincial Board and Provincial Development Council. Sofronio S. Sanqui was appointed college president on 19 December 1994 and sworn into office on 29 December, the same year, by DECS Secretary Ricardo T. Gloria, after the retirement of Rebong. Sanqui was the vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the Graduate School before his appointment. Sanqui focused on human resource development and student development. The state college established the following service areas in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro: *Damayan Center - San Isidro, on a plot. *Experimental Forestry - adjacent the Damayan Center on a land. *Caminawit Extension Program - Caminawit *Agro-Forestry Center - Labangan on an land. Expansion within San Jose In the year 2000, by virtue of Republic Act 8760 (also known as the General Appropriations Act) significant reforms were brought about in the educational system, specifically to OMSC. It became the host to CHED-supervised institutions in the province, namely the Occidental Mindoro Polytechnic College (OMPC) in Murtha, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro and the Pedro T. Mendiola, Sr. Memorial Technological and Polytechnic College in Brgy. Bagong Sikat, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro. With the integration, OMPC became known as the OMSC-OMPC Campus, while the PTMSMTPC was renamed to OMSC-PTMSMTPC and is now situated at the Labangan Campus. After 15 years of sterling and dedicated service to the Institution, Sofronio S. Sanqui, the second college president, retired. He was replaced by Arnold N. Venturina, when the Board of Trustees of the College elected him on 11 September 2009. With the change of administration, several significant changes in the programs and policies of the college were also enforced. Three months to Venturina‚Äôs presidency, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed RA 9747, also known as an ‚ÄúAct renaming Occidental Mindoro National College as the Occidental Mindoro State College‚Äù, on 10 November 2009, whose principal sponsor was Congresswoman and Deputy Speaker, Amelita C. Villarosa. On 1 May 2010, the college was conferred the ‚ÄúSan Jose Builders Award (Education Sector)\\" by the San Jose Centennial Commission.

Findings from these experiments can be used to manipulate the immune system and develop drugs to combat immunological diseases.  Immunization  Experimental immunologists study responses to simple antigens through immunization, the deliberate induction of an immune response in animal or human subjects.Murphy, K., P. Travers, et al. (2008). Janeway's Immunobiology. New York and London, Garland Science. The immunized subject is then monitored for antibody response. This often involves the analysis of antiserum samples that contain specific antibodies against the immunizing antigen, and blood lymphocytes from lymphoid organs for examination of T cell- mediated responses. However, some antibodies found in antiserum are cross- reactive. This means that they bind antigens that have no apparent relationship to the immunogen, and are problematic when antiserum is used to detect antigens that bind specifically to these antibodies. This can be resolved by absorption of these antibodies with their cross-reactive antigen, leaving only the antibodies that are specific to the immunogen of interest.  Antibody Experiments  B cell immune responses are measured by analyzing antibodies produced through the humoral immune response. Serum is isolated from a clotted blood sample, and the circulating antibody that accumulates in the plasma is assayed by methods that include the following: *Affinity chromatography, by which antibodies of interest are isolated from solution by the specific binding of antigens anchored to a solid matrix. *Radioimmunoassays (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA),LeQuin, R. M. (2005). \\"Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA)/Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).\\" Clinical Chemistry 51(12): 2415-2418. which are direct binding assays for antibodies that use pure preparations of known antigens to create a protein standard. The concentration of the unknown antigen can then be determined by comparison with this standard. *Competitive inhibition assays, which determine the concentration of a particular antigen in an unknown sample based on how successfully it competes with a labelled reference antigen in binding to antibodies bound to a plastic well. *Precipitin reactions,Martelli, G. P. \\"Part III: Laboratory methods for detection and identification of infectious agents.\\" Retrieved 13 Nov, 2009, from . which determine the absolute and relative amounts of antigen and antibody by measuring the amount of precipitate formed when antibodies mix with soluble macromolecular antigens. These experiments are used to determine the specificity, amount, isotype and affinity of the antibodies produced. Antibodies are highly specific for their particular antigens. They are therefore relatively easy to isolate and study, and make highly efficient probes in a range of biological experiments.RA Young, R. D. (1983). \\"Efficient isolation of genes by using antibody probes.\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 80(5): 1194-1198.  Lymphocyte Experiments  In studying lymphocytes, the first step is to isolate them so that they can be studied in vitro. Lymphocytes can be isolated from blood, or from lymphoid organs such as the thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues. Methods include the following: *Density centrifugation, which isolates a population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by separating the solution into layers of differing densities. PBMC layers contain mononuclear cells that have been depleted of red blood cells, leukocytes and granulocytes. *Biopanning, which isolates cell populations from solution. Cells of interest are bound to antibody-coated plastic surfaces, and unwanted cells are removed by treatment with specific antibody and complement. *Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, which detects and counts lymphocytes passing through a laser beam. The FACS is a flow cytometer that separates labelled cells based on differences in the light scattering and fluorescence of cells.Herzenberg LA, D. R. S., Herzenberg LA (2000). \\"Monoclonal antibodies and the FACS: complementary tools for immunobiology and medicine.\\" Immunology Today 21(8): 383-390. Upon isolation, the lymphocytes are characterized in terms of specificity, frequency and function. Frequently used assays include the ELISPOT, which measures the frequency of T cell response. It is similar to the ELISA assay in that antibodies bound to plastic wells are used to bind the cytokines secreted by T cells.  Manipulation of the Immune Response  Findings from the experiments thus described can be used to manipulate the immune response and develop treatments to combat immunological diseases. For example, adoptive transferBerger C, T. C., Jensen MC, et al. (2009). \\"Adoptive transfer of virus-specific and tumor-specific T cell immunity.\\" Current Opinion in Immunology 21(2): 224-232. is used to study the effects of lymphocytes in the absence of other lymphoid cells. Ionizing radiation kills lymphoid cells while leaving other tissues of the body intact, and this eliminates immune function. The body is thus prepared for restoration of immune function by adoptive transfer of new lymphocytes. Another method is hematopoietic stem-cell transfer,Jonathan L Powell, P. H., Stephan A Grupp. (2009). \\"Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.\\" Retrieved 13 Nov, 2009, from . used for studying lymphocyte development. Hematopoietic cells are killed by ionizing radiation, and the hematopoietic system is replaced by transfusion of donor bone marrow or purified hematopoietic stem cells. The resulting individuals are termed radiation bone marrow chimeras. The abovementioned methods have been researched extensively, but there remain many areas in immunology that have yet to be covered, ranging from autoimmune diseases to transplant rejection. There is still room for progress, and only the future will tell what developments are yet to come.

They, in turn, were encouraged to participate in the violence and pogroms by the Gauleiter of Danzig-West Prussia, Albert Forster, who in a speech at the Prusinski Hotel in Wejherowo agitated ethnic Germans to attack Poles by saying \\"We have to eliminate the lice-ridden Poles, starting with those in the cradle‚Ä¶ in your hands I give the fate of the Poles, you can do with them what you want\\". The crowd gathered before the hotel chanted \\"Kill the Polish dogs!\\" and \\"Death to the Poles\\".El≈ºbieta Grot, Biblioteka Publiczna Gminy Wejherowo im. Aleksandra Labudy w Bolszewie \\"Ludob√≥jstwo w Pia≈õnicy z uwzglƒôdnieniem los√≥w mieszka≈Ñc√≥w powiatu wejherowskiego.\\" (\\"Genocide in Pia≈õnica with a discussion of the fate of the inhabitants of Wejherow county\\") , Public Library of Wejherowo. The Selbstschutz participated in the early massacres at Pia≈õnica, and many of their members later joined police and SS formations which continued the massacres until the Fall of 1940. Organized action aimed at exterminating the Polish population of the region, however, began only after the end of the September campaign, with the Intelligenzaktion in Pomerania (Intelligence Action Pomerania), a part of an overall Intelligenzaktion by Nazi Germany aimed at liquidating the Polish elite. Its main targets were the Polish intelligentsia, which was blamed by the Nazis for pro-Polish policies in the Polish corridor during the interwar period. Educated Poles were also perceived by the Nazis as the main obstacle to the planned complete Germanization of the region. As a result, even before the Nazi invasion of Poland, German police and Gestapo prepared special lists of Poles which they regarded as representative of Polish culture and life in the region, who were to be executed. According to official criteria, the Polish \\"intelligentsia\\" included anyone with a middle school or higher education, priests, teachers, doctors, dentists, veterinarians, military officers, bureaucrats, medium and large businessmen and merchants, medium and large landowners, writers, journalists and newspaper editors. Furthermore, all persons who during the interwar period had belonged to Polish cultural and patriotic organizations such as (Polish Union of the West) and Maritime and Colonial League. As a result, between the fall of 1939 and the spring of 1940, in the Intelligenzaktion Pommern and other actions, Germans killed around 65,000 Polish intellectuals and others. The main site of these murders were the forests around Wielka Pia≈õnica.  The executions  Digging the graves Victims before the execution Mass execution in Pia≈õnica Moments before the execution Bodies of the victims Pia≈õnica Wielka is a small Kashubian village located around 10 km from Wejherowo. The forests around it were chosen by the Germans as the site of the mass murders because it was easily accessible by bus and truck, it had a nearby rail line, and at the same time, it was located far enough from other villages and centers of population. The most commonly accepted timeline for the beginnings of the executions is late October 1939. However, the date of the first execution is uncertain and disputed among historians. According to Zygmunt Milczewski, this happened on 21 October. Prof. Andrzej GƒÖsiorowski states that the first person to be killed was the priest, Father Ignacy B≈Ça≈ºejewski, on 24 October. Prof. Barbara Bojarska gives the date as 29 October. Former prisoners and witnesses likewise give various dates at the end of October, and even the first few days of November. The victims were transported to the execution sites by cars and trucks. Usually, they were forced to strip and on some occasions to dig their own graves. They were then lined up on the edge of the ditches they had dug and machined-gunned down, although sometimes regular rifles and pistols were also used. Some of the wounded were finished off with blows of rifle butts, as is documented by the broken skulls that have been exhumed from the graves. Estimates and records suggest that a single platoon of the 36th SS Regiment Wachsturmbann \\"Eimann\\", named after its commander , involved in the massacres was capable of killing around 150 people daily.El≈ºbieta Maria Grot, \\"Ludob√≥jstwo w Pia≈õnicy jesieniƒÖ 1939 r. ze szczeg√≥lnym uwzglƒôdnieniem losu mieszka≈Ñc√≥w Gdyni\\" (\\"Genocide in Pia≈õnica in the fall of 1939, with a discussion of fates of inhabitants of Gdynia\\"), Pa≈Ñstwowe Muzeum Stutthof, oddzia≈Ç w Sopocie (National Museum of Stutthof, Sopot Division) Witnesses report that on numerous occasions, prior to the executions, the victims were tortured and children, in particular, were treated with utmost cruelty, and often killed by having their heads smashed against trees by German SS soldiers.Tadeusz Piotrowski, \\"Poland's holocaust: ethnic strife, collaboration with occupying forces and genocide in the Second Republic, 1918‚Äì1947\\", McFarland, 1998, pg. 25. The most detailed accounts of one of the executions come from witness accounts regarding 11 November, (Polish Independence Day). On that day, Germans murdered around 314 Polish and Jewish hostages in Pia≈õnica. According to the testimony of former Gestapo and later, Smersh agent, Hans Kassner (alias '), made in 1952, the executions on that day lasted from early morning until three in the afternoon. Men and women were led in fives to the previously dug graves and shot. Some of the victims were buried alive. One of those killed was Sister Alicja Kotowska, the head of the convent in Wejherowo. Witnesses report that as she was being transported from the prison to the execution site, Kotowska huddled and comforted Jewish children who were also being taken to be executed at Pia≈õnica. During the post-war exhumation, Alicja's corpse was not identified but a grave was found containing a rosary of the kind worn by sisters of her order. The grave where the rosary was found is presently the site of a memorial. In 1999 Alicja Kotowska was beatified by Pope John Paul II along with 107 other martyrs. The area around the forests where the massacres were taking place was surrounded with police and paramilitary groups in order both to prevent any victims from escaping and also to preclude access to any potential witnesses from the outside. Despite these arrangements, the local Polish and Kashubian populace was able to observe the numerous transports going to the forests and could hear the sounds of gunfire. The last transports to the site were seen in the spring of 1940 and contained mostly patients from mental hospital from within the Third Reich, in particular from Stettin (Szczecin) and Lauenburg (Lƒôbork). The total number of victims, killed in an area around Pia≈õnica of about 250 square kilometers is estimated at between twelve and sixteen thousand, including women, children and infants.  The victims  The prison in Puck where victims were held and tortured before being shipped to Pia≈õnica, along with a plaque Due to the fact that in 1944, the Germans exhumed and burned many of the corpses in an attempt to hide the crime, the exact number of victims is not known, nor are many of their names and national origins. From investigations carried out after the war, three different groups of victims can be identified: * The first group of about 2,000 persons, mostly Poles and Kashubians from Gda≈Ñsk Pomerenia, arrested in September and October 1939 and subsequently held in prisons in Wejherow, Puck, Gda≈Ñsk, Kartuzy, and Ko≈õcierzyna. * The second group, the largest, of 10,000 to 12,000 people, consisted of Polish, Czech and German families who had been transported from other areas of General Government and the Third Reich. This group also included many Polish workers who had migrated to Germany for economic reasons in the interwar period. The estimated number is based on the mass graves that had been found and on eyewitness reports by railroad men who observed the arriving transports. * The third group included about 1,200 (some sources give 2,000) mentally ill patients, transported from hospitals in Stralsund, Ueckerm√ºnde, Altentreptow and Lauenburg (Lƒôbork). Investigations carried out so far have established the names of about 600 of the 12,000 to 14,000 murdered.  The perpetrators  There were three groups which were primarily involved in carrying out the massacres: * Einsatzkommando 16, under the command of the chief of the Gda≈Ñsk Gestapo SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer * Special units of the Wachsturmbann \\"Eimann\\" from the 36th Regiment of SS * Local ethnic Germans from Wejherowo, members of Selbstschutz, led by the German mayor of Wejherowo Gustaw Bamberger and the county director of the Nazi party Heinz Lorentz. The headquarters of the command in charge of carrying out the ethnic cleansing were in a villa on Krokowska St. in Wejherowo.  Attempts at hiding the murders  After the extermination action was ended in the Spring of 1940, the organizers and perpetrators began the process of covering their deeds. Trees and bushes were planted on the site of the graves, and German police restricted access to the area in the following years. In the second half of 1944, during the Red Army's offensive, Nazi authorities anticipated the evacuation of German military and civilian personnel. During this time, an organized action was undertaken to destroy evidence of the massacres. Thirty- six prisoners from the concentration camp KL Stutthof were chosen and brought to the forests in August 1944. Chained and bound, they were forced to dig up the graves, remove the bodies and burn them in specially prepared forest crematoria. After six weeks of this work, the prisoners were murdered by the SS troops which supervised them, and their bodies burned as well. Local German civilians participated in further covering up any traces of the burning of the bodies. Despite the attempts by the Germans to cover up the massacre, photographs of the events survived. Two local Germans, Georg and Waldemar Engler who ran a photography studio in Wejherowo took part in the massacres as part of the paramilitary organizations. The younger Engler, Waldemar, made a photographic record of the massacre. Both of them were tried and sentenced for war crimes after the war.  Punishment and responsibility  In 1946 a National Tribunal in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland, held Albert Forster, the Gauleiter of the Gda≈Ñsk Region and the Nazi administrator of Pomerania and Western Prussia, responsible for the murders at Pia≈õnica, as well as for other war crimes. He was sentenced to death and the sentence was carried out on 28 February 1952, in Warsaw. A German court in Hamburg in 1968 sentenced SS leader Kurt Eimann to four years in prison for his participation in killing of the German mentally ill at Pia≈õnica (but not the Polish intellectuals and citizens also murdered there). Richard Hildebrandt, Higher SS and Police Leader in Pomerania, was sentenced to death by a Polish court in Bydgoszcz for his part and role in organizing the murders. A British military court in Hamburg in 1946, sentenced Max Pauly, the former commander of the Stutthof Concentration Camp and also the commander of the Neuengamme concentration camp to death for war crimes. During the proceedings, Pauly did not reveal that he had also taken part in the executions at Pia≈õnica, Stutthof and other places in German- occupied Pomerania. The sentence was carried out at Hameln Prison in 1946, by Albert Pierrepoint. The occupation mayor of Puck, F. Freimann, was also sentenced to death by a court in Gdynia.

Depending on the situation, a head start may be inherent, obtained by special privilege, earned through one's accomplishments, or granted mercifully by an opponent. While not guaranteeing success, a head start will increase such chances. In sports In competitive sports, such as a race, a head start refers to a start ahead of other competitors, allowing a shorter distance to the finish line. The idea of a head start may seem unfair. But in some cases, a head start is an advantage that may be earned by one more of the competitors. Also, adults who are racing against children may provide children with a head start, knowing the children are slower, and wanting to allow them a chance to win. In multiple-event or multiple-day competitions, such as the modern pentathlon, the final event may use a head start where the leader of the competition starts first over his opponents based on the time or points advantage. In modern pentathlon, the points leader after the first four events takes a head start in the 3,000-meter cross country event based on his lead over his opponent. The first competitor to the finish line wins. In baseball In baseball, base runners who are attempting to steal bases or advance more bases in the event of a hit may attempt to get a head start off their base before the pitcher throws his pitch. This may be risky, as the pitcher could throw the ball to the respective infielder, and if the runner cannot get back before the ball arrives in the hands of the infielder, the runner may be picked off. In traffic In traffic, at a red light, many motorists will start to inch up in anticipation of the light turning green (watching the signal of the perpendicular traffic). This will give them a head start on other motorists on the road. In achieving a goal A head start could be an improved start in an attempt to achieve some goal, such as in one's education or the completion of a task. In such cases, the head start is usually earned by working harder or by using more efficient means of reaching that point.

The district was listed as a Michigan Historic Site and added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 6, 1982. The area is commonly referred to as the downtown area and is the oldest settled area in Monroe, dating back to 1817 when the area was first platted. Some of the oldest surviving buildings in this district date back to 1830, and the district incorporates several different architectural styles. The stretch of the district that runs along M-125 is also designated as one of the Pure Michigan Byways. History The area dates back to 1817 when the first roads were drawn out on a piece of land given by local landowner Joseph Loranger for the establishment of the village for the newly organized Monroe County. The grid plan, drawn up by Henry Disbrow, was modeled after the system used in New York City, with streets named after numbers. Although small at first, the city grew rapidly along the River Raisin beginning around 1830. While much of the growing population began spreading throughout Monroe County, the majority lived within the Old Village where the center of government and industry resided. The current county courthouse was built in 1880, although the plot of land it is located on has housed the seat of the county government since 1817. Monroe opened its first post office in 1913. The main industry at the time was Monroe's numerous paper mills along the River Raisin. The Dundee Historic District in Dundee was settled further up the river around the same time, and the two heavily relied on the river and built several dams along its course. The Navarre-Anderson Trading Post, built in 1789, was originally part of the Old Village along the River Raisin. However, development in the area threatened the historic structure, and it was moved in 1894 and again in 1971. Today, it is far removed from the rest of the Old Village. The Sawyer House was built in 1873 and is located at 320 East Front Street within the Old Village Historic District. On July 4, 1910, then-President William Howard Taft and Elizabeth Bacon Custer unveiled a statue to commemorate George Armstrong Custer, who spent much of his early life living in Monroe. The statue was located in the middle of the intersection of East First Street and Washington Street in the Old Village. This was during a time when automobile traffic in Monroe was very light. However, with the increase of automobile traffic, the statue's location in the middle of an intersection warranted protests as a traffic hazard. On June 20, 1923, the city moved the statue out of the Old Village to a less prominent location along the River Raisin, where it remained until it was moved again in August 1955 to its current location on the other side of the river from the Old Village. Today, the statue is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the George Armstrong Custer Equestrian Monument. The district has seen little redevelopment or expansion since the 1930s. In the 1960s, several older buildings within the district were demolished to make way for new modern buildings and parking lots, as the district was seen as old fashioned and unable to keep with the demands of new industries and growing populations. Present day Today, the district itself centers around M-125 and M-50,When the district was first designated on May 6, 1982, Front Street was known as M-50 and may appear named as such on certain lists and maps. However, in October 2006, M-50's eastern terminus was truncated 1.17 miles (0.66 km) from M-125 to US-24. The current road that runs through the Old Village Historic District is now under local control under the name Front Street. :See, Bessert, Chris (1997‚Äì2009). Michigan Highways: Highways 50 to 59, accessed November 12, 2009. known locally as Monroe Street and Front Street respectively, and extends for several blocks east and south. The district is roughly bounded by the River Raisin on the north, 7th Street on the south, and Navarre Street on the east. Most of the major businesses and industries began moving to the more spacious outer core of Monroe. Today, the center of government and law enforcement within Monroe remains in the Old Village. The row buildings along Monroe Street consist of small businesses on the ground level and apartments and offices on the second and third floors. The outer areas of the Old Village include the city hall, post office, county courthouse and jail, Monroe Bank & Trust headquarters, various small businesses, Monroe Middle School, and larger houses. No industries remain within the Old Village today. The Old Village remains an active part of Monroe's economy, although the majority of businesses have moved elsewhere in the city. The Old Village Historic District is located directly across the river from the East Elm-North Macomb Street Historic District and the St. Mary's Church Complex Historic District.

Fitzgerald, June 1, 1993, pp. 1‚Äì2. The white soldiers' camp was named after Gen. David Hunter. It was built along the south crest of the Spring Creek valley. The combined number of troops in both camps was about 6,000 men, according to Hugh Thompson, who was stationed as a scout in the area in June 1862. The Army had three reasons for the establishment of the two camps. The first was to help escort wagon trains south into Indian Territory, where Indians loyal to the Confederacy attacked Union wagon trains. A second use for the camps was to be a place to send tired cavalry horses. The area west of the camps had much grass. The soldiers from the camps were needed to guard the horses. A third reason for the establishment of the camps was to oppose the bushwhackers and Confederate Indians who roamed through the area. The major guerrilla group was under the command of Capt. Thomas R. Livingston.Kyrias, \\"The Civil War in Baxter Springs,\\" pp. 1‚Äì2; Kyrias, letter to Pollard, p. 3. As soon as the two camps were established, the Union troops took action to eliminate Livingston's guerrillas. Livingston, with about twenty-five men, had established a camp two miles northeast of Camp Hunter. The combined Union forces, under the direction of Col. Charles Doubleday, overran Livingston's camp, capturing many supplies and horses.Kyrias, \\"The Civil War,\\" p. 1; Kyrias, letter to Pollard, p. 3. Livingston was not to be eliminated, however. Further attempts to destroy his force or capture it resulted in frustration. The Union troops from the two camps, and other Union troops nearby, repeatedly forced the guerrillas to scatter. Instead of being able to round them up, however, they found the guerrillas would simply disappear, not to be found until they decided to attack Union troops. After the War it was discovered the guerrillas had established a well concealed camp (Livingston's Hideout) 5¬Ω miles east of Camp Hunter and just inside the Kansas border with Missouri.Kyrias, \\"The Civil War,\\" pp. 2‚Äì3; Kyrias, letter to Pollard, pp. 1‚Äì3. In early September 1862 the area around Camp Hunter found itself in the path of a Confederate offensive. The 31st Texas Cavalry, under Col. Tresevant C. Hawpe, headed toward the two camps, which were quickly abandoned. He continued north and was defeated in a battle near present day Pittsburg, Kansas. After his defeat Hawpe retreated back to Camp Hunter and briefly occupied it. Possibly Livingston and Confederate Indians under Col. Stand Watie visited Camp Hunter around the same time. From Camp Hunter, Hawpe invaded southwest Missouri, helping other Confederates in defeating Union forces in the First Battle of Newtonia on September 30. After Hawpe left, Camp Hunter was never occupied again. When Union forces returned to Baxter Springs in May 1863, they set up camp at a different site.Kyrias, \\"The Civil War,\\" pp. 2‚Äì3; Col.

Subsequently, there has been a radical reshaping of environmental conditions following the development of chemically synthesized fertilizers. History Egyptians, Romans, Babylonians, and early Germans all are recorded as using minerals and/or manure to enhance the productivity of their farms. The use of wood ash as a field treatment became widespread.Heinrich W. Scherer \\"Fertilizers\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. In the 19th century, guano, which had been known and used in the Andes for at least 1500 years, was taken in large quantities from Peru and Chile (and later also from Namibia and other areas) to Europe and the USA. Key figures in Europe In the 1730s, Viscount Charles Townshend (1674‚Äì1738) first studied the improving effects of the four crop rotation system that he had observed in use in Flanders. For this he gained the nickname of Turnip Townshend.  Johann Fredrich Mayer  Johann Friedrich Mayer (1719‚Äì1798) was the first to present to the world a series of experiments upon it the relation of gypsum to agriculture, and many chemists have followed him in the 19th century. Early 19th century however a great variety of opinion remained with regard to its mode of operation, for example:John Armstrong, Jesse Buel. A Treatise on Agriculture, The Present Condition of the Art Abroad and at Home, and the Theory and Practice of Husbandry. To which is Added, a Dissertation on the Kitchen and Garden. 1840. p. 45. * The French agronomist Victor Yvart (1763‚Äì1831)SeeVictor Yvart at the French Wikipedia believed that the action of gypsum is exclusively the effect of the sulphuric acid, which enters into its composition; and founds this opinion upon the fact that the ashes of turf, which contain sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina, have the same action upon vegetation as gypsum. * The French agronomist Charles Philibert de Lasteyrie (1759‚Äì1849), observing that plants whose roots were nearest the surface of the soil were most acted upon by plaster, concludes that gypsum takes from the atmosphere the elements of vegetable life, and transmits them directly to plants. * Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc intimates that the septic quality of gypsum (which he takes for granted) best explains its action on vegetation; but this opinion is subverted by the experiments of Davy. * Humphry Davy found that, of two parcels of minced veal, the one mixed with gypsum, the other left by itself, and both exposed to the action of the sun, the latter was the first to exhibit symptoms of putrefaction. Davy's own belief on this subject is, that it makes part of the food of vegetables, is received into the plant, and combined with it. Mayer also promote new regimes of crop rotation.G√ºnter Rudolf Golde (1975) Catholics and Protestants: agricultural modernization in two German villages. p. 15 Justus von Liebig Chemist Justus von Liebig (1803‚Äì1873) contributed greatly to the advancement in the understanding of plant nutrition. His influential works first denounced the vitalist theory of humus, arguing first the importance of ammonia, and later promoting the importance of inorganic minerals to plant nutrition. Primarily Liebig's work succeeded in exposition of questions for agricultural science to address over the next 50 years. In England, he attempted to implement his theories commercially through a fertilizer created by treating phosphate of lime in bone meal with sulfuric acid. Although it was much less expensive than the guano that was used at the time, it failed because it was not able to be properly absorbed by crops. Sir John Bennet Lawes John Bennet Lawes, an English entrepreneur, (view timeline of his life and work) began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, and a year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field. One immediate consequence was that in 1842 he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid, and thus was the first to create the artificial manure industry. In the succeeding year he enlisted the services of Joseph Henry Gilbert, who had studied under Liebig at the University of Giessen, as director of research at the Rothamsted Experimental Station which he founded on his estate. To this day, the Rothamsted research station the pair founded still investigates the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yields. Jean Baptiste Boussingault In France, Jean Baptiste Boussingault (1802‚Äì1887) pointed out that the amount of nitrogen in various kinds of fertilizers is important. Metallurgists Percy Gilchrist (1851‚Äì1935) and Sidney Gilchrist Thomas (1850‚Äì1885) invented the Gilchrist-Thomas process, which enabled the use of high phosphorus acidic Continental ores for steelmaking. The dolomite lime lining of the converter turned in time into calcium phosphate, which could be used as fertilizer, known as Thomas-phosphate. The Birkeland-Eyde Process The Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process was developed by Norwegian industrialist and scientist Kristian Birkeland along with his business partner Sam Eyde in 1903, based on a method used by Henry Cavendish in 1784. This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used for the production of synthetic fertilizer. A factory based on the process was built in Rjukan and Notodden in Norway, combined with the building of large hydroelectric power facilities. The process is inefficient in terms of energy usage, and is today replaced by the Haber process. The Haber Process In the early decades of the 20th century, the Nobel prize-winning chemists Carl Bosch of IG Farben and Fritz Haber developed the Haber processHaber & Bosch Most influential persons of the 20th century, by J√ºrgen Schmidhuber which utilized molecular nitrogen (N2) and methane (CH4) gas in an economically sustainable synthesis of ammonia (NH3). The ammonia produced in the Haber process is the main raw material of the Ostwald process. The Ostwald process The Ostwald process is a chemical process for production of nitric acid (HNO3), which was developed by Wilhelm Ostwald (patented 1902). It is a mainstay of the modern chemical industry and provides the raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production, globally (for example, ammonium nitrate, a common fertilizer, is made by reacting ammonia with nitric acid). Historically and practically it is closely associated with the Haber process, which provides the requisite raw material, ammonia (NH3). Erling Johnson In 1927 Erling Johnson developed an industrial method for producing nitrophosphate, also known as the Odda process after his Odda Smelteverk of Norway. The process involved acidifying phosphate rock (from Nauru and Banaba Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean) with nitric acid to produce phosphoric acid and calcium nitrate which, once neutralized, could be used as a nitrogen fertilizer. Industry An ammonia generator =British= The developing sciences of chemistry and Paleontology, combined with the discovery of coprolites in commercial quantities in East Anglia, led Fisons and Packard to develop sulfuric acid and fertilizer plants at Bramford, and Snape, Suffolk in the 1850s to create superphosphates, which were shipped around the world from the port at Ipswich. By 1871 there were about 80 factories making superphosphate. After World War I these businesses came under competitive pressure from naturally produced guano, primarily found on the Pacific islands, as their extraction and distribution had become economically attractive. The interwar period saw innovative competition from Imperial Chemical Industries who developed synthetic ammonium sulfate in 1923, Nitro-chalk in 1927, and a more concentrated and economical fertilizer called CCF (Concentrated Complete Fertiliser) based on ammonium phosphate in 1931. Competition was limited as ICI ensured it controlled most of the world's ammonium sulfate supplies. =North America and other European Countries= Founded in 1812, Mirat, producer of manures and fertilizers, is claimed to be the oldest industrial business in Salamanca (Spain). Other European and North American fertilizer companies developed their market share, forcing the English pioneer companies to merge, becoming Fisons, Packard, and Prentice Ltd. in 1929. Together they produced 85,000 tons of superphosphate/year in 1934 from their new factory and deep-water docks in Ipswich. By World War II they had acquired about 40 companies, including Hadfields in 1935, and two years later the large Anglo-Continental Guano Works, founded in 1917. The post-war environment was characterized by much higher production levels as a result of the \\"Green Revolution\\" and new types of seed with increased nitrogen-absorbing potential, notably the high-response varieties of maize, wheat, and rice. This has accompanied the development of strong national competition, accusations of cartels and supply monopolies, and ultimately another wave of mergers and acquisitions. The original names no longer exist other than as holding companies or brand names: Fisons and ICI agrochemicals are part of today's Yara International and AstraZeneca companies. Major players in this market now include the Russian fertilizer company Uralkali (listed on the London Stock Exchange), whose former majority owner is Dmitry Rybolovlev, ranked by Forbes as 60th in the list of wealthiest people in 2008.

Using the unique propagation characteristics of high-frequency radio waves, the ground stations provide data link communications to properly equipped aircraft operating anywhere in the world. As a result, pilots can always communicate with someone on the ground . Avionics supporting HFDL To use the service, an aircraft only needs a Communications Management Unit (CMU), or equivalent and an HFDL data radio. The CMU is an airborne communications router that interfaces with many aircraft communications systems including SATCOM, VHF, HFDL, FMS and others. Global coverage Today, HFDL is an air/ground data link standard with coverage in virtually every corner of the globe, approximately where aircraft are never out of touch both in the air and on the ground. There are around 15 HF ground stations (HGS) available today, and, like a canopy within a jungle, the stations provide overlap and redundancy in the unlikely event of a HGS failure. These 15 stations provide nearly complete global coverage, including both poles, and system availability is 100 percent. Evolving technology The HFDL network and avionics are a continuing evolution. Recent innovations in avionics software developed by both Honeywell and Collins have enhanced performance and contribute to the service‚Äôs outstanding message success rates. There is continued investment in the HFDL infrastructure and there is a long term strategy in place to ensure its success. ARINC have been quoted as saying that the system and its use have grown at rates above 20% for each of the past ten years and it now supports over sixty airlines with well over 1,200 aircraft sending more than 1 million messages a month. In 2009 eight new operating frequencies were added which brings the total number of frequencies to 167 worldwide. Increased system use The design of the system allows for 4 channels per ground station. Currently, 13 stations are only using ¬Ω of the designed capacity. 2 others are using 3 of the 4 designed channels. Stations are actively monitored for traffic load and can determine when additional channels needs to be added by the service providers. HFDL outperforms HF voice Due to the digital nature of HFDL, it uses between 1/3 and 1/2 of the bandwidth that voice requires, so data can continue to be decoded when voice is unusable. This was proven during the 2003 Halloween Solar Storm when aircraft were still using HFDL on polar routes when voice was unusable. Automatic frequency selection HFDL does not require pilots to dial in specific frequencies, as with HF voice, the data radios constantly scan and select the most efficient frequency to use making operation seamless for flight crews.

Though a guard in the NFL, Boren played both guard and center during his high school and college football career. In high school, he was widely regarded as one of the top offensive linemen in the country and one of the top football prospects in the state of Ohio. He was selected to play in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and was a Parade All-American and an Associated Press All-Ohio selection. The son of 1982 and 1983 Michigan Wolverines tackles leader Mike Boren, Justin was widely recruited by the nation's top schools, including both his father's alma mater, the University of Michigan and its archrival, Ohio State University, Boren's hometown school. After an intense recruitment, Boren choose to play at Michigan despite leaning towards attending Ohio State early in his recruitment. He played in several games as a true freshman, making one start. As a sophomore, he became a regular starter, earning 2007 All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention. When head coach Lloyd Carr retired and was replaced by Rich Rodriguez, Boren became unhappy with the new staff and transferred to Ohio State. After transferring he had to sit 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and was also required to pay his own tuition, per Big Ten conference rules. He earned recognition as a selection to the 2009 and 2010 All-Big Ten team by both the coaches (second-team) and the media (first-team). He was also a 2010 College Football All-America Team second team selection by several selectors. In 2009, he became the third player (following Howard Yerges and J. T. White) to play for both sides of the Michigan ‚Äì Ohio State rivalry. He was also teammates with his brother, Zach Boren, who was a starting fullback and linebacker for the Buckeyes. His other brother, Jacoby Boren, is currently the starting center at Ohio State. He was signed by the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League as an undrafted free agent in 2011. He has since played for the Ravens, Detroit Lions, and Denver Broncos. Early life and high school Boren is Jewish, and was born in Pickerington, Ohio. He was a freshman starter at Pickerington High School Central before transferring to Pickerington High School North the following year. As a high school sophomore, Boren played guard and was an honors student. During his high school years, his father was his harshest critic. As a junior, he was listed as a nose guard on defense and an offensive tackle. That season, he earned Division I Associated Press All-Ohio High School Football Team special mention. By the time he was a junior, he was being recruited by both Ohio State, the local school, and Michigan, where his father played. As a senior who bench pressed and squatted , he was regarded as Central Ohio's most sought after high school football recruit. As a result, he was selected to participate as one of 78 players in the 2006 U.S. Army All- American Bowl where he started at left offensive guard for the East team. He was also selected to the Associated Press first-team Division I All-Central District and All-Ohio high school football teams as an offensive lineman. After committing to Michigan, he enrolled in classes at the University of Michigan in January of what would have been the end of his senior year in high school along with roommate Carlos Brown. Of all the football prospects from the state of Ohio, Boren was the only one that Ohio State was not able to lure. College career alt=football team in yellow and blue uniforms in the huddle. Michigan Having enrolled in January 2006, Boren (and roommate Brown) were available to participate in 2006 Spring Football. Both players participated in spring practice, which was part of a national trend of more high schoolers enrolling early. Although early enrollment had been occurring for several years, Kevin Grady had been the first at Michigan in 2005. As a freshman during the 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2006 Michigan Wolverines, Boren was injured during training camp, and he did not dress in the season opener. He had suffered a broken leg. Despite being injured through the entire month of September, Boren decided not to redshirt and debuted during the Paul Bunyan Trophy rivalry game against Michigan State on October 7. Two weeks later, when Rueben Riley got injured against the Iowa Hawkeyes, he played the entire second half. On October 28, with Riley still injured, he became only the fourth true freshman to start on the Michigan offensive line in the modern era during a victory against Northwestern. The following week against Ball State, Boren saw action after Jake Long got kicked in the helmet. Boren's final action of the season came against the Indiana Hoosiers on November 11. During the 2006 season, all of his appearances were at guard. During 2007 Rose Bowl practices at the end of the 2006 season, Boren had practiced exclusively at center. alt=a quarterback rolls out while his offensive line blocks Boren had been recruited as either a center or a guard, but he preferred to play guard. In spring practice the following year, Boren was moved to center. At the end of the National Collegiate Athletic Association-sanctioned 15 days of spring football practice, he was announced as the starting center, replacing Mark Bihl. This decision was confirmed when training camp started in the fall, even though Boren had never before played center. Thus, the starting offensive line was composed of veterans Long and Adam Kraus on the left and then Boren, right guard Jeremy Ciulla and right tackle Stephen Schilling neither of whom had ever started a game. The 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season was eagerly anticipated for the 2007 Wolverines with returning seniors Long, Mike Hart and Chad Henne in key roles, but the season quickly began to fall apart when the team lost to the two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers in the opening game. When Ryan Mallett played in place of Henne during the September 15, Notre Dame rivalry game, left-handed snapper Boren switched positions with right-handed snapper Kraus who otherwise played left guard. The switch occurred after Mallett fumbled two snaps from Boren, whose left-handed snaps were foreign to the right-handed Mallett. The switch caused a little confusion with official starting lineups the following week when Mallett started. On September 22 against Penn State, both Boren and Kraus had casts on their snapping hands and Boren played center despite the fact that Mallett was starting. During Mallett's October 27 start in the Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota, Kraus started at center. The following week during the Paul Bunyan Trophy against Michigan State, the position switch was made permanent. After the regular season, Boren was recognized as an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection. Prior to the 2008 Capital One Bowl, Boren was expected to return to center because Henne had returned to full strength. However, during the game, Boren played guard and Kraus played center. After the season, both Boren and Kraus were named to Jewish Sports Review's 2007 College Football All-America Team. alt=football team in yellow and blue uniforms in the huddle. After the season, head coach Lloyd Carr was replaced by Rich Rodriguez. Rodriguez' no huddle spread option offense, which used zone blocking, was a major adjustment for Boren. By the tenth day of spring practice Boren had left the team. Boren made a statement to the press regarding his decision, which included the following excerpt: \\"Michigan football was a family, built on mutual respect and support for each other from (former) Coach (Lloyd) Carr on down. We knew it took the entire family, a team effort, and we all worked together. . I have great trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months. . .That I am unable to perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, is why I have made the decision to leave.\\" A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. According to Section 14.5.2.B of the Rules of Eligibility in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: \\"Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. This is a big part of why offensive lineman Justin Boren left the team. He felt his dignity was at stake.\\" alt=Three football players in red and grey uniforms approach the line of scrimmage. Ohio State When Boren arrived at Ohio State at and , he was one of the smallest offensive linemen on the team. During his redshirt season, he wore the number 56. In order to bond with his new teammates such as Alex Boone, he shaved lightning bolts into his head. While redshirtting, he stood out in practice where he performed on the scout team. In fact, during the week leading up to the final regular season game against Michigan, he wore the Winged Football Helmet that Michigan is known for as part of the scout team. The 2008 Ohio State Buckeyes football team included three seniors on the offensive line: Boone, Steve Rehring and Ben Person. A total of 28 seniors graduated from the football team leaving the 2009 Ohio State Buckeyes football team with five returning starters on offense for the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season. However, the team had the number one recruiting class in the nation according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Both Scout.com and Rivals.com agreed with this number one ranking prior to the final signing period and although the offensive line had been the team's problem in 2008, the highly touted class included three tackles and a guard plus transfer Boren. In the spring of 2009, Hope Boren spoke at signing day about her two sons prospects for at Ohio State: \\"As a parent, you always try to raise kids who are happy and successful . . . And I know my kids are happy and I think they'll be successful.\\" Zach Boren said, \\"Everyone in the whole family is an Ohio State fan now. . .No one cares about Michigan at all anymore. That was in the past and we're all looking forward to being Buckeyes and staying Buckeyes for the rest of our lives.\\" During spring practice, Boren impressed his coaches and teammates; however, he refused all interview requests. During the summer, when asked about the impending Michigan ‚Äì Ohio State game he said \\"My attitude is there are 11 games before that game,. . .I can't let myself get worked up thinking about that game. I don't want to take a chance of being unprepared for any of the first 11 games. The week that game gets here, it will be my primary focus.\\" By then, he was projected to be the starting left guard, and he was expected to be an important part of the team. Boren blocking for Dane Sanzenbacher Prior to the 2009 season, Boren suffered a knee injury. The injury was not severe because of the knee brace that he was wearing. He recovered in time to be in the starting lineup at left guard along with his younger brother who started at fullback for the September 5 season opener against Navy. The media portrayed Boren as a nasty and intense player, which Boren downplayed. Early in the season, the offensive line struggled. But as the season progressed guards Boren and Bryant Browning teamed up with second-year linemen Michael Brewster, J.B. Shugarts and Mike Adams to form a unit that worked effectively. Boren missed the October 31 non-conference game against New Mexico State due to an unspecified foot injury. When he returned to Michigan Stadium for the season finale, Michigan defensive end Brandon Graham was very vocal about Boren's departure. At the conclusion of the 2009 Big Ten season, he was named to the All-Big Ten Conference team by both the coaches (second-team) and the media (first-team). The following 2010 season, he repeated as a first team media and second team coaches All-Big Ten Conference selection. He was named as a second team All-American selection by Associated Press, CBS Sports, Rivals.com and Scout.com. Professional career Boren was one of 56 offensive linemen invited to participate in the February 24 ‚Äì March 1, 2011 NFL Scouting Combine. He ranked thirteenth in the bench press with a total of 28 repetitions. He ranked eleventh in the three cone drill with a time of 7.57. Following the draft and the 2011 NFL lockout, Boren was regarded as one of the best available free agents. Baltimore Ravens Boren was signed by the Baltimore Ravens on July 26, 2011. Boren's former University of Michigan offensive line coach Andy Moeller was a coach with Baltimore at the time of his signing. He was waived by the team on September 3, 2011, but he was signed to the practice squad on September 5. On January 3, 2012, during the first round bye week of the 2011‚Äì12 NFL playoffs, Boren was activated. On September 1, 2012, Boren was assigned to injured reserve. Boren reached an injury settlement with the team before being removed from the roster later that week. Detroit Lions Boren was named to the practice squad of the Detroit Lions on November 20, 2012. Denver Broncos On January 7, 2013, the Denver Broncos signed Boren to a futures contract. On August 7, 2013, Boren was waived/injured by the Broncos. On August 8, 2013, he cleared waivers and was placed on the Broncos' injured reserve list. Personal life Boren's father, Mike Boren, played football for Michigan from 1980‚Äì83 and his mother, Hope, ran track there from 1979‚Äì82. Boren attended the 2005 Michigan Summer Football Camp. Mike led the Wolverines in tackles in 1982 and 1983. Justin's youngest brother, Jacoby, was a sophomore at Pickerington Central High School in 2009. By December 2010, Jacoby had committed to Ohio State.

It is named after John Selfridge and John Horton Conway. Selfridge discovered it in 1960, and told it to Richard Guy, who told it to many people, but Selfridge did not publish it. John Conway later discovered it independently, and also never published it. This procedure was the first envy-free discrete procedure devised for three partners, and it paved the way for more advanced procedures for n partners (see envy-free cake- cutting). A procedure is envy-free if each recipient believes that (according to its measure) no other recipient has received more than he has. In their solution, the maximal number of cuts in the procedure is five. The pieces are not always contiguous. The Procedure Selfridge‚ÄìConway division Suppose we have three players P1, P2 and P3. Where the procedure gives a criterion for a decision it means that criterion gives an optimum choice for the player. # P1 divides the cake into three pieces he considers of equal size. #Let's call A the largest piece according to P2. #P2 cuts off a bit of A to make it the same size as the second largest. Now A is divided into: the trimmed piece A1 and the trimmings A2. Leave the trimmings A2 to the side for now. #* If P2 thinks that the two largest parts are equal (such that no trimming is needed), then each player chooses a part in this order: P3, P2 and finally P1. #P3 chooses a piece among A1 and the two other pieces. #P2 chooses a piece with the limitation that if P3 didn't choose A1, P2 must choose it. #P1 chooses the last piece leaving just the trimmings A2 to be divided. It remains to divide the trimmings A2. The trimmed piece A1 has been chosen by either P2 or P3; let's call the player who chose it PA and the other player PB. #PB cuts A2 into three equal pieces. #PA chooses a piece of A2 - we name it A21. #P1 chooses a piece of A2 - we name it A22. #PB chooses the last remaining piece of A2 - we name it A23. Analysis Let's see why the procedure is envy-free. It must be shown that each player believes that no other player received more than he had. Without loss of generality, we can write (see illustration above): *PA received: A1 + A21. *PB received: B + A23. *P1 received: C + A22. In the following analysis \\"largest\\" means \\"largest according to the player\\": *PA received A1 + A21. For him, A1 ‚â• B and A1 ‚â• C. And he considers his choice A21 to be the largest piece of A2. So no other player received more than he did: A1 + A21 ‚â• B + A23, C + A22. * PB received B + A23. For him, B ‚â• A1 and B ‚â• C since he chose B. Also, he is the one that cut A2 in 3 pieces, so for him all those pieces are equal. *P1 received C + A22. For him, C ‚â• A1 and C = B. P1 believes that PB didn't receive more than he did. In other words: C + A22 ‚â• B + A23. Remember that P1 chose his piece of A2 before PB, thus A22 ‚â• A23 in his view. P1 believes that PA didn't receive more than he had. In other words: C + A22 ‚â• A1 + A21. Remember that for P1, C is equal to A since he cut the cake in the first round. Also, A = A1 + A2 = A1 + (A21 + A22 + A23); therefore C ‚â• A1 + A21. (Even if PA took the whole A2 and P1 did not receive A22, P1 would not envy PA.) Generalizations Note that if all we want is an envy-free division for a part of the cake (i.e. we allow free disposal), then we only need to use the first part of the Selfridge‚ÄìConway procedure, i.e.: * P1 divides the cake into three pieces equal for him; * P2 trims at most one piece such that there are two pieces equal for him; * P3 takes a piece, then P2, then P1. This guarantees that there is no envy, and additionally each partner receives a value of at least 1/4 the total (since the total number of pieces is 4). This procedure can be generalized to 4 partners in the following way: * P1 divides the cake into 5 pieces equal for him; * P2 trims at most 2 pieces, such that there are now 3 pieces equal for him; * P3 trims at most 1 piece, such that there are 2 pieces equal for him; * P4 takes a piece, then P3, then P2, then P1. This guarantees that there is no envy, and additionally each partner receives a value of at least 1/8 the total (since the total number of pieces is 8). By induction. the procedure can be generalized to n partners, the first one dividing the cake to 2^{n-2}+1 equal pieces and the other partners follow by trimming. The resulting division is envy-free and each partner receives a value of at least 1/2^{n-1} of the total. We can apply the same procedure again on the remainders. By doing so an infinite number of times, we get an envy-free division of the entire cake. A refinement of this infinite procedure yields a finite envy-free division procedure - the Brams‚ÄìTaylor procedure.

The primary target market for gay media may also more broadly be considered to include members of a LGBT audience. __TOC__ Origins The origins of gay media, as with much of LGBT community culture, are to be found in informal networking activities, often building over a number of years, to an extent where communications media that began as little more than photocopied newsletters gradually evolved to reach increasing numbers of people. Earlier forms of gay media almost always commenced by way of printed media. Evolution There is of course no single evolution process that is common to all gay media products, in all countries‚Äîwhich may be created decades apart‚Äîhowever analysis of many current media products reveals an often similar evolutionary history behind some of today's most prominent gay media products. As the number of readers increased, amateur gay media products were able to increase the number of copies being created, moving from amateur to professional printing methods, and then slowly begin to target commercial advertisers, often involving a process where the gay media product is seen to metamorphose from a purely community non-profit initiative to a commercial initiative, seeking for-profit advertising as part of its business model. In this way the evolving of a viable gay media industry around the world has both led to, and been facilitated by, the parallel development of a gay market in many countries. Today There exists today in most markets around the world at least some media products that predominantly target a gay audience. The advent of the internet has seen a technically global reach for modern gay media. Whereas traditionally focused only on print products, gay media today‚Äîin line with media generally‚Äîsees a shift of emphasis away from print products towards newer media forms delivered via online means or by way of TV distribution systems.

She yearns to climb the social ladder and be a rich 'tai-tai', squandering most of her money on branded bags and clothes. After persuading her husband to move into a bungalow, she spurlges on expensive furniture, disguising the invoices and receipts to trick him into believing that the items were all imitations.

Yuxiang as no choice but to comply with her husband's wishes. She is an enemy of her neighbour, the rag- and-bone man Wu Youli. They often threaten each other with lawsuits and trade insults over seemingly trivial matters. Shanguo longs to have a son to carry on the Zheng name, but Yuxiang constantly rejects the idea. Eventually, she gets pregnant with a son, and Shanguo is overjoyed, if not over protective of the foetus. Yuxiang constantly worries about the love life of her daughters and always tries to matchmake them with rich and handsome boyfriends, but always fails in her matchmaking sessions.

When Yuxiang finds out that Fang Kai's family is rich, she wholeheartedly agrees to their relationship. Janet, however, schemes to break the couple up and succeeds. In a drunken stupor, Aizhen sleeps with Liqin, who also had a part to play in Janet's scheme. After Liqin's girlfriend goes overseas, Janet bribes Liqin to marry Aizhen. He and Aizhen go from bickering rivals to a loving couple within weeks. Not long after, Liqin proposes to Aizhen, but she rejects him as marriage had never crossed her mind.

D√πn an Achaidh, sometimes Anglicised as Dun Acha, is a dun located near the village of Acha on the Inner Hebridean island of Coll. It is considered the best preserved dun on the island. The site of D√πn an Achaidh is located at . According to local tradition, the dun was the stronghold of, and named after, the son of a Norse king. The early 20th century antiquary Erskine Beveridge considered it as one of the four most interesting fortifications on Coll (along with D√πn Anlaimh, D√πn Dubh, and D√πn Morbhaidh). Etymology OS map of D√πn an Achaidh, near Acha. Dun an Achaidh takes its name from the Scottish Gaelic An t-Achadh, which translates into English as \\"the field\\". According to the early 20th century antiquary Erskine Beveridge, the dun was known in local tradition by the Scottish Gaelic name, Dun Bhorlum mhic Anlaimh righ Lochlinn (see Lochlann). He gave two translations for this: \\"the fort of ridge of the son of Olaf, King of Norway\\"; or \\"the fort of Borlum, son of Olaf, King of Norway\\". Beveridge noted that borlum is an old Gaelic word meaning \\"ridge\\"; and that this thoroughly described the site of D√πn an Achaidh. According to Rev. Dugald MacEchern, borlum means \\"board-land\\", which is \\"the home farm of a residence or mansion\\". MacEchern also noted that the locals considered Borlum to be a personal name. Location and description D√πn an Achaidh is located about south-west of Acha Mill on Coll. Of all the duns on Coll, it is the second furthest from the shore (the dun atop Druim an Airidh Fhada being furthest). D√πn an Achaidh sits atop a rocky ridge which is high above the surrounding land which is drained by Allt a' Mhuilinn (translates into English as \\"the stream of the mill\\"). D√πn an Achaidh is situated about south of the crannog, D√πn Anlaimh. Ruins and archaeological finds Stone implement or weapon found at D√πn an Achaidh. The wall of the dun is considered to have originally been about thick. It runs along a ridge on the ridge and encloses an area of , from north-east to south- west, by a maximum of . An entrance is located on the north-east end of the dun. The approach to this entrance is protected by a wall which lies about below the summit area. This wall measures, in area, ; and is made of large boulders. There have been several archaeological finds at the site; including decorated pottery, a slate whorl, and a stone pounder. These finds are now located in the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland. History Beveridge suggested that it was very likely that several of the duns of Coll, and the nearby island of Tiree, were occupied by the Norse during the Viking Age. He noted that the names that some of them bear; and in the cases of D√πn an Achaidh and nearby D√πn Anlaimh, the local traditions would also seem to confirm this. In 1587, atrocities committed between warring west highland clans had escalated to such an extent that the Scottish parliament devised what is known as the General Band, in an effort to quell hostilities. The band, or bond, was signed by landowners throughout the Scottish highlands, borders and the islands. The signing chiefs and landowners were required to come up with sureties equal to their wealth and lands for the peaceful conduct of their followers and those who lived upon their lands. One of the lists drawn up was titled \\"The roll of the names of the landislordis and baillies of landis in the hielandis an isles, quhair brokin men hes duelt and presentlie duellis\\". The laird of Coll (Hector Maclean of Coll) was one of the chiefs listed on this roll. 'Broken men' were generally men who had no chief and who were often outlaws. Beveridge wrote that these men adopted \\"the Viking principle of living at the expense of those who were weaker than themselves\\". Beveridge proposed that the 'broken men' on Coll, mentioned in 1587, would have likely dwelt in the more remote areas on the island; and that the old duns would have offered such men a certain amount of defensive security. He concluded that there was no doubt that some of the duns on Coll were inhabited well within historic times. Beveridge wrote that it was said, locally on Coll, that Samuel Johnson visited D√πn an Achaidh during his tour of the Hebrides. However, Beveridge noted neither Johnson, nor James Boswell, made mention of visiting any of the duns on the island. Traditions associated with D√πn an Achaidh Location of duns, hillforts, and crannogs, on Coll. Beveridge stated that according to local tradition the dun was the stronghold of a Norseman, named as the son of a king named Anlaimh (Olaf). The story was that the local islanders revolted under his tyranny and attacked the dun at night; setting fire to it and routed the Norse occupiers. Beveridge noted that the tradition of setting fire to the dun seemed to have been validated by the evidence of fire still visible on the dun's foundations (evidence which Beveridge came across before knowing the local legend). In the early 20th century, Rev. Dugald MacEchern detailed a tradition concerning D√πn an Achaidh.

Synopsis Fai (Nick Cheung), a legendary triad figure, was convicted and sent to prison for life, for slaughtering rival gangsters in a gang fight. A local council member assisted him with paroling, leading to his subsequent early release from prison 30 years later. Mongkok has, however, completely changed and he has almost forgotten his way back home. Fai's fellow gangster Porky (Willie Wai) is due to take over as head of their triad gang after years of service, but his personality is deemed unsuitable as a leader. Another member in the gang, Peter, also has interests set in becoming the leader. It becomes apparent that both Porky and Peter may be using Fai as a pawn in their game towards winning the grand prize. It emerged that on that fateful night 30 years ago, Fai was shot by a policeman, Yue, who is now a major figure within the police force because he had managed to shoot Fai and therefore ensuring his arrest. Yue turns out to be someone with his own agenda as well, but things are not always as they seem and there is a different story to be told. Meanwhile, Porky has unseemly interests in Pamela (Monica Mok), a prostitute who became a love interest of Fai, as well as her younger sister, who is mentally disabled. Porky constantly makes crude sexual advances towards the sisters, only to have Fai rescue them on numerous occasions, which causes further friction between them.

The site covers pop culture and lifestyle issues from a feminist perspective; and the political climate as it pertains to the community. AfterEllen is not affiliated with entertainer Ellen DeGeneres, although its name refers to her coming out ‚Äî specifically when her character came out in \\"The Puppy Episode\\" (1997) on her eponymous sitcom. AfterEllen originally reported on subjects of popular culture, such as celebrities, fashion, film, television, music, and books; publishing articles, regular columns, opinion pieces, interviews, reviews, recaps of television shows with lesbian and bisexual characters or subtextual content, and popularity contests. Weekly vlogs were a key feature, the more popular of which included \\"Brunch With Bridget\\", \\"Lesbian Love\\", and \\"Is This Awesome?\\" The site also featured popular web series such as the Streamy Award- winning and Webby Award-nominated Anyone But Me. AfterEllen later included news and politics affecting lesbians, bi women, and the general community. Its podcast, Let's Process, ran from 2014‚Äì2016, and was revived in 2020 as the AfterEllen Podcast. Ownership of the website changed hands in 2006 (Logo), 2014 (Evolve Media), and 2019 (Lesbian Nation). History 2002‚Äì2005 AfterEllen was founded April 15, 2002 by Sarah Warn and Lori Grant, under their corporation Erosion Media. (via HighBeam Research) A companion site focusing on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media, AfterElton.com, was founded in January 2005. Its name was an homage to Elton John. The site rebranded as TheBacklot.com in April 2013, and was dissolved in June 2015. 2006‚Äì2015 In 2006, AfterEllen and AfterElton were acquired by cable television channel Logo. In 2007, in response to the popular \\"Maxim Hot 100\\" readers contest for heterosexual men, the annual \\"AfterEllen Hot 100 List\\" poll of women in \\"film, television, music, sports and fashion\\" was created. The special feature ran until 2016. In March 2008, AfterEllen was named one of \\"the world's 50 most powerful blogs\\" by British newspaper The Guardian for its \\"irreverent look at how the lesbian community is represented in the media. At the time considered the top website for lesbian women, that same year it averaged \\"over 700,000 readers\\" per month. In October 2009, Sarah Warn announced that associate editor Karman Kregloe would take over as Editor in Chief. In June 2011, the site ranked as the second most popular LGBT website with 203,924 monthly visitors, after The Advocate. In October 2014, Evolve Media acquired AfterEllen from Viacom Media Networks, the parent company of Logo, and made it a part of its TotallyHer Media subsidiary. Kregloe announced that managing editor Trish Bendix would be assuming the role of Editor in Chief. In November 2014, TotallyHer Media announced the launch of The Lphabet, an original AfterEllen online comedy series that would \\"demystify terms from the lesbian and bi community\\". According to Karman Kregloe, in 2015 AfterEllen \\"averaged 1.25 million readers\\" per month. 2016‚Äìpresent In September 2016, Trish Bendix announced her departure on her personal Tumblr blog and stated that AfterEllen was shutting down, with only its archive to be kept live. TotallyHer Media denied the allegation by Bendix, calling it a \\"false rumor\\", and on September 20, 2016, Evolve Media fired Bendix ahead of her scheduled departure. Emrah Kovacoglu, General Manager of TotallyHer Media, explained that a drawback was triggered by the lack of \\"increased audience\\" and \\"enough advertiser support to justify continuing to invest at the same levels\\". Memoree Joelle became Editor in Chief of AfterEllen in December 2016. Joelle promised readers that there would be a return to the website's original intention of maintaining a \\"feminist perspective\\" and staying \\"true to a lesbian/bi perspective\\", as well as \\"more racial diversity and age diversity\\". Soon afterwards, Joelle issued a statement in which she questioned the motives behind the increase in \\"attack\\" language directed at lesbians from members of the LGBT community, and the decline in interest within it \\"to hear the variety of perspectives in our community\\". Under her editorial direction, articles and essays of political nature became more frequent. In December 2016, Joelle added her personal signature and endorsement statement to the \\"L is out of GBT\\" petition on Change.org: Former AfterEllen senior editor Heather Hogan criticized Joelle on Twitter for doing so, accusing Joelle of promoting a \\"lesbophobia\\" movement on AfterEllen which, according to Hogan, was a disguise for \\"anti-trans, anti-bi\\" rhetoric. Joelle denied Hogan's accusations and described her reasoning as \\"a FORM of activism\\". In 2018 ‚Äî after banning use of the controversial term \\"TERF\\" on its website and social media channels, publishing articles such as \\"Girl Dick, the Cotton Ceiling and the Cultural War on Lesbians, Girls and Women\\" by Miranda Yardley, and the op-ed \\"How I became the most hated lesbian in Baltimore\\" by Julia Beck, as well as for giving publicity to vloggers who criticized trans women activism in the lesbian community ‚Äî AfterEllen (although not specifically mentioned) was by implication accused of transphobia in a general declaration titled \\"Not in our name\\" signed by representatives of nine lesbian and queer publications in which \\"trans misogynistic content\\" in \\"so-called lesbian publications\\" was condemned, including \\"male-owned media companies\\" that profited \\"from the traffic generated by [such] controversies\\". The trans-related controversy received coverage on NBC Out, the LGBTQ section of mainstream media NBC News. In response to NBC Out's news story, Joelle and AfterEllen colleagues described the \\"Not in our name\\" statement as \\"a continuation of a false narrative that's been created to perpetuate division and anxiety within the lesbian community\\", and denounced the backlash launched against AfterEllen for addressing issues such as \\"lesbians [being] called 'vagina fetishists' with 'genital preferences'\\"; repudiating the \\"idea that lesbians are not allowed to have an opinion, or feel anything for that matter. That we can't have any autonomy. That we must bow to groupthink at every turn or be subjected to homophobic slurs, attacks on our jobs, doxing.\\" It was also revealed that AfterEllen \\"was invited...to sign the statement as well, the day after it was released.\\" In March 2019, AfterEllen was bought by Lesbian Nation, a multimedia company owned by Memoree Joelle and business partner Gaye Chapman. With this change in ownership, articles and opinion pieces concerning controversies affecting lesbians and bisexual women increased. \\"AfterEllen does not use the word queer to describe lesbians\\" was announced in an editorial addendum to a March 2020 article. In September 2020, the site declared their stance on terms used for referring to females: \\"We will NEVER use the words 'womxn' or 'cis' or any other derogatory, insulting, abusive terms directed at females. Women are women.\\" In June 2020, Joelle announced the promotion of Jocelyn Macdonald, managing editor of AfterEllen, to Editor in Chief. Podcast AfterEllen's official podcast, Let's Process, premiered on November 18, 2014 and continued until January 13, 2016. The podcast was relaunched under a new name, AfterEllen Podcast, on April 29, 2020.

The first public concert given by the trio was on March 1, 2009 at Chicago‚Äôs Murphy Auditorium for the world premiere of a recently rediscovered piano trio by (Hess 47) Ludwig van Beethoven, as well as the American premiere of another Beethoven trio (Anhang 3) and the Chicago premiere of yet another Trio (Opus 63); the performance also included the well-known ‚ÄúArchduke‚Äù Trio by Beethoven. John von Rhein, music critic of the Chicago Tribune, wrote about the trio's first concert that \\"for musicians who had never worked together as a trio before, pianist George Lepauw, violinist Sang Mee Lee and cellist Wendy Warner made a splendid ensemble, playing with finely judged balance, evenness of sound and unanimity of style [...] Lepauw, Lee and Warner ended their program with Beethoven‚Äôs familiar ‚ÄúArchduke‚Äù Trio, a masterpiece that drew fully on their individual and collective abilities. The slow movement emerged with particular eloquence here.\\" The Beethoven Project Trio in performance, March 1, 2009 The Beethoven Project Trio is one of the performing ensembles (along with the Beethoven Project Chamber Players) of an umbrella organization, the International Beethoven Project, which organized the trio's world premiere Beethoven performance in March 2009 and co-produced their recording along with Cedille Records. The International Beethoven Project is currently a branch of the PianoForte Foundation of Chicago. Purpose of the group The purpose of the Beethoven Project Trio is to explore all of Beethoven's trio works and to approach them within the context of Beethoven's complete output and life- story. On occasion, the group will explore the trio repertoire by other composers who either inspired or were inspired by Beethoven. Of interest to the group is also the occasional commission of a new piano trio. The Beethoven Project Trio also has a strong educational mission, which the group fulfills by giving performances in schools, giving lectures, and master classes. When possible, the group supports charities by donating performances or by helping to raise awareness of important issues that help to make the world better, in the spirit of Beethoven's own care for humanity.

In the 1970s and early 1980s the shop was popular with skinheads and punks from all over the world, who came to buy bovver boots or brothel creepers. Customers could borrow a marker pen to write messages on the walls that would then be read by other skinhead crews or punk bands on tour. In the late 1970s, the shop's owner, Alan Roumana, formed a close association with the local band North London Invaders, who would later become Madness. The band used to buy loafers from the shop, and they featured the store in their music videos \\"The Prince\\" and \\"The Sun and The Rain\\".

Running northeast‚Äìsouthwest, it bisects the neighbourhood along its length. To the north it connects to Trangraven, the canal which separates Christianshavn from Holmen; to the south it makes an angular break and empties in the main harbour a little north of the Langebro bridge. At the middle, Christianshavns Kanal is crossed by B√∏rnehusbroen. This bridge is part of Torvegade, the main thoroughfare of Christianshavn, connecting the city centre across Knippelsbro to the northwest to Amager the southeast. The only other bridge traversing the canal is Snorrebroen, located further north. Christianshavns Kanal is noted for its bustling sailing community with numerous house- and sailboats, particularly in the northern half of the canal. Canal side streets Overgaden oven Vandet and Overgaden neden Vandet are two streets running along each their side of Christianshavns Kanal. Over- in the street names derives from the German word Ufer, meaning shore or bank. \\"oven vandet\\" and \\"neden vandet\\" refers to the two halves which Christianshavn is cut into by the canal, \\"neden vandet\\" being the inner (City Side) side of the neighbourhood and \\"oven vandet\\" being the outer (Amager Side) side .

Reppert (born September 4, 1946) is an American neuroscientist known for his contributions to the fields of chronobiology and neuroethology. His research has focused primarily on the physiological, cellular, and molecular basis of circadian rhythms in mammals and more recently on the navigational mechanisms of migratory monarch butterflies. He was the Higgins Family Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Massachusetts Medical School from 2001 to 2017, and from 2001 to 2013 was the founding chair of the Department of Neurobiology. Reppert stepped down as chair in 2014. He is currently distinguished professor emeritus of neurobiology. Biography Early life Steven Reppert grew up in the village of Pender, Nebraska, and graduated from Pender Public High School in 1964. His interest in science began in childhood with the cecropia moth‚Äîan insect made famous by Harvard biologist Carroll M. Williams, who used the moth in his pioneering work on the role of juvenile hormone in molting and metamorphosis. Reppert continues to rear cecropia from egg to adult each summer. Education and career Reppert received his BS and MD in 1973 (with distinction) from the University of Nebraska College of Medicine and was elected as a medical student to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. From 1973 to 1976 he did an internship and residency in pediatrics at the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1976 to 1979 Reppert was a postdoctoral fellow in neuroendocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, in David C. Klein's laboratory, which focuses on the pineal gland and circadian biology. Reppert was on the faculty at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School beginning in 1979 and was promoted to professor in 1993; he directed the Laboratory of Developmental Chronobiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1983 to 2001, when he moved to the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Research Reppert has published more than 180 papers. He is the principal inventor on seven patents derived from his research. Fetal circadian clocks Rodent studies have shown that the master brain clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is functional in the fetus before the fetal brain is capable of registering the presence of light. Reppert and colleagues reported that the fetal SCN is entrained to the light-dark cycle before the retinohypothalamic pathway innervates the SCN from the eye. This finding indicates that the mother, and her entrainment to ambient light-dark cycles, provides the necessary information to the fetus for synchronization. As Reppert states, ‚ÄúMom is functioning as the transducer for the fetal circadian system. She takes in light information to her circadian system, and then that is communicated to the fetal circadian system.‚Äù This fetal entrainment persists into the postnatal period and ensures that neonatal behavioral patterns are properly tuned with the environment. Dopamine and melatonin can both act as perinatal maternal entraining signals. Mammalian circadian clocks Steven Reppert and colleagues have made seminal contributions that provide insight into the mammalian circadian clock mechanism. =Cell autonomy in the SCN= Reppert and colleagues discovered that the SCN contains a large population of autonomous, single-cell circadian oscillators. They cultured cells from neonatal rat SCN on fixed microelectrode array that allowed them to monitor individual SCN neuron activity in culture. Circadian rhythms expressed by neurons in the same culture were not synchronized, indicating that they functioned independently of one another. =Functions of mouse clock genes: PERIOD2 and PERIOD3= Reppert and coworkers also discovered the mouse clock genes mPer2 and mPer3 and defined their functions. They found that the mPER2 and mPER3 proteins, as well as the previously discovered mPER1, share several regions of homology with one another and with Drosophila PER. Reppert and coworkers found different light responses among the three Per genes. Unlike mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA levels, mPer3 mRNA levels are not acutely altered by light exposure during the subjective night. They also found that mPer1‚Äì3 are widely expressed in tissues outside the brain, including the liver, skeletal muscles, and testis. To determine the function of mPER1‚Äì3, Reppert and colleagues disrupted the three genes encoding them. Using double-mutant mice, they showed that mPER3 functions outside the core circadian clockwork, whereas both mPER1 and mPER2 are necessary for rhythmicity. =Negative transcriptional feedback loop= Reppert and colleagues discovered that the two mouse cryptochromes, mCRY1 and mCRY2, function as the primary transcriptional repressors of clock gene expression, and the mPER proteins are necessary for CRY nuclear translocation. This work provided the first portrayal of a negative transcriptional feedback loop as the major gear driving the mouse molecular clock. =Interlocking transcriptional feedback loops= Reppert and colleagues found that the core mechanisms for the SCN in mammals consist of interacting positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops. The first loop is an autoregulatory negative transcriptional feedback loop in which the mCRY proteins negatively regulate mCry and mPer gene transcription. The second interlocking feedback loop involves the rhythmic regulation of Bmal1. Rhythmicity of Bmal1 is not necessary for clockwork function, but it helps modulate the robustness of rhythmicity. =CLOCK and NPAS2= Reppert and colleagues discovered that the transcription factors CLOCK and NPAS2 have overlapping roles in the SCN, revealing a new and unexpected role for NPAS2. His lab observed that CLOCK- deficient mice continue to have behavioral and molecular rhythms, which showed that CLOCK is not essential for circadian rhythm in locomotor activity in mice. They then determined, by investigating CLOCK-deficient mice, that NPAS2 is a paralog of CLOCK and can functionally substitute CLOCK by dimerizing with BMAL1. Finally, they found‚Äîby investigating CLOCK-deficient, NPAS2-deficient, and double-mutant mice‚Äîthat circadian rhythms in peripheral oscillators require CLOCK. Thus, there is a fundamental difference between CLOCK and NPAS2 that is tissue dependent. Mammalian melatonin receptors In 1994, Reppert cloned human and sheep Mel1a melatonin receptor, the first in a family of GPCRs that bind the pineal hormone melatonin, and localized its expression in the mammalian brain to the SCN and the hypophyseal pars tuberalis. Mel1a is believed to be responsible for the circadian effects of melatonin and the reproductive actions in seasonal breeding mammals. In 1995, Reppert cloned and characterized the Mel1b melatonin receptor. He and colleagues found that the receptor was predominantly expressed in the retina, where it is believed to modify light-dependent retinal functions. They identified outbred populations of Siberian hamsters that lacked functional Mel1b but maintained circadian and reproductive responses to melatonin; these data indicate that Mel1b is not necessary for the circadian and reproductive actions of melatonin, which instead depend on Mel1a. Elucidation of the molecular nature of the melatonin receptors has facilitated definition of their ligand-binding characteristics and aided the development of melatonin analogs that are now used to treat sleep disorders and depression. Insect cryptochromes In 2003, Reppert began investigating the functional and evolutionary properties of the CRY protein in the monarch butterfly. He identified two Cry genes in the monarch, Cry1 and Cry2. His work demonstrated that the monarch CRY1 protein is functionally analogous to Drosophila CRY, the blue-light photoreceptor necessary for photoentrainment in the fly. He also demonstrated that monarch CRY2 is functionally analogous to vertebrate CRYs and that monarch CRY2 acts as a potent transcriptional repressor in the circadian clock transcriptional translation feedback loop of the butterfly, as his group previously showed for the two mouse CRYs. These data propose the existence of a novel circadian clock unique to some non-drosophilid insects that possesses mechanisms characteristic of both the Drosophila and the mammalian clocks. Other insects, such as bees and ants, possess only a vertebrate-like CRY, and their circadian clocks are even more vertebrate like. Drosophila is the only known insect that does not possess a vertebrate-like CRY. In 2008, Reppert discovered the necessity of Cry for light-dependent magnetoreception responses in Drosophila. He also showed that magnetoreception requires UVA/blue light, the spectrum corresponding with the action spectrum of Drosophila CRY. These data were the first to genetically implicate CRY as a component of the input pathway or the chemical-based pathway of magnetoreception. Applying these findings to his work with the monarch, Reppert has shown that both monarch CRY1 and CRY2 proteins, when transgenically expressed in CRY-deficient flies, successfully restore magnetoreception function. These results propose the presence of a CRY-mediated magnetosensitivity system in monarchs that may act in concordance with the sun compass to aid navigation. In 2011, Reppert also discovered that human CRY2 can substitute as a functional magnetoreceptor in CRY-deficient flies, a discovery that warrants additional research into magnetosensitivity in humans. Monarch butterfly migration Since 2002, Reppert and coworkers have pioneered the study of the biological basis of monarch butterfly migration. Each fall, millions of monarchs from the eastern United States and southeastern Canada migrate as much as 4,000 km to overwinter in roosts in Central Mexico. Monarch migration is not a learned activity, given that migrants flying south are at least two generations removed from the previous year's migrants. Thus, migrating monarchs must have some genetically based navigational mechanism. Reppert and colleagues have focused on a novel circadian clock mechanism and its role in time-compensated sun compass orientation, a major navigational strategy that butterflies use during their fall migration. Using clock-shift experiments, they showed that the circadian clock must interact with the sun compass to enable migrants to maintain a southerly flight direction as the sun moves daily across the sky. Reppert collaborated with Eli Shlizerman at the University of Washington and Daniel Forger at the University of Michigan to propose a working mathematical model of the time-compensated sun compass. =Clockwork mechanism= The monarch clockwork model, which has both Drosophila-like and mammal-like aspects, is unique because it employs two distinct CRY proteins. As presented in a 2010 review paper, the clock mechanism, on a gene/protein level, operates as follows: * In an autoregulatory transcriptional feedback loop, heterodimers of CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) form and drive the transcription of the Per, Tim, and Cry2 genes. * TIM, PER, and CRY2 proteins are translated and form complexes in the cytoplasm. * 24 hours later, CRY2 returns to the nucleus and inhibits CLK:CYC transcription. * Meanwhile, PER is progressively phosphorylated, which may aid CRY2 translocation into the nucleus. * CRY1 protein is a circadian photoreceptor that, when exposed to light, causes TIM degradation, allowing light to gain access to the central clock mechanism for photic entrainment. =Antennal clocks= Reppert‚Äôs lab expanded upon Fred Urquhart's postulation that antennae play a role in monarch migration. In 2009 Reppert‚Äôs lab reported that, despite previous assumptions that the time- compensation clocks are located exclusively in the brain, there are also clocks located in the antennae, which \\"are necessary for proper time- compensated sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies.‚Äù They concluded this by comparing the sun compass orientation of monarch migrants with intact antennae and those whose antennae had been removed. Reppert's lab also studied antennae in vitro and found that antennal clocks can be directly entrained by light and can function independently from the brain. Further research is needed, however, on the interaction between the circadian clocks in monarch butterfly's antennae and the sun compass in the brain. In 2012, Reppert and colleagues determined that only a single antenna is sufficient for sun compass orientation. They did so by painting one antenna black to cause discordant light exposure between the two antennae; the single not-painted antenna was sufficient for orientation. All four clock genes (per, tim, cry1, and cry2) were expressed in the various studied areas of the antenna, suggesting that \\"light entrained circadian clocks are distributed throughout the length of the monarch butterfly antenna.\\" In 2013, Reppert and colleagues showed that spring remigrants also use an antenna-dependent time-compensated sun compass to direct their northward flight from Mexico to the southern United States. =Sun compass= Using anatomical and electrophysiological studies of the monarch butterfly brain, Reppert and colleagues have indicated that the central complex, a midline structure in the central brain, is likely the site of the sun compass. =Magnetic compass= Reppert and colleagues showed that migratory monarchs can use a light-dependent, inclination-based, magnetic compass for navigation on overcast days. =Temperature= Reppert and coworkers showed that fall migrants prematurely exposed to overwintering- like coldness reverse their flight orientation to the north. The temperature microenvironment at the overwintering site is essential for successful completion of the migration cycle: without cold exposure, aged migrants continue to orient to the south. The discovery that coldness triggers the northward flight direction in spring remigrants underscores how vulnerable the migration may be to climate change. =Monarch butterfly genome= In 2011, Reppert and colleagues presented the draft sequence of the monarch butterfly genome and a set 16,866 protein-coding genes. This is the first characterized genome of a butterfly and of a long-distance migratory species. In 2012, Reppert and colleagues established MonarchBase, an integrated database for the genome of Danaus plexippus. The goal of the project was to make genomic and proteomic information about monarch butterflies accessible to biological and lepidopteran communities. In 2013, Reppert and coworkers developed a novel gene-targeting approach in monarchs that uses a zinc finger nuclease strategy to define the essential nature of CRY2 for clockwork function in lepidopterans. Targeted mutagenesis of Cry2 indeed resulted in the in vivo disruption of circadian behavior and the molecular clock mechanism. Nuclease strategies are powerful tools for targeting additional clock genes in monarchs and altering gene function. In 2016, Reppert collaborated with Marcus Kronforst at the University of Chicago and others to use population genetic studies to define the evolutionary history of the monarch migration.

She had a brother, John Braye, 2nd Baron Braye, of whom she was one of his co-heirs, along with her younger sisters, Elizabeth, Frideswide, Mary, Frances, and Dorothy Bray, Baroness Chandos. The latter was 23 years Anne's junior. In 1517 or before 1526, she married George Brooke (1497 ‚Äì 29 September 1558), the brother-in-law of poet Sir Thomas Wyatt. He was knighted in July 1523 by the Earl of Surrey after the taking of Morlaix, and he would succeed his father as 9th Baron Cobham on 19 July 1529; henceforth, Anne was styled as Baroness Cobham. They lived at Cobham Hall in Kent and Cowling Castle. Together George and Anne had 10 sons and five daughters.

Dying in 1647, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Prince Frederik.  Biography  The Crown Prince of Norway and his mother, Queen Anne Catherine. Prince Christian's sarchophagus.  Early life  Prince Christian was born at Copenhagen Castle to King Christian IV (1577-1648) and Queen Anne Catherine (1575-1612) of Denmark, Norway, etc. Christian was their second son and the oldest one living, as his elder brother Frederik had died in 1599, less than a year old. As such, his father saw him as the preferable heir to the Danish throne. Denmark was an elective monarchy, where elective power was held by the Council of the Realm. However, the King would usually choose an heir and have him hailed as such, thus limiting the Council's freedom of choice. Whilst Norway was formally a hereditary monarchy, making Christian Crown Prince since his birth, it remains likely that the next King of Norway would not have been another person than the next King of Denmark. In 1608, the Council and representatives of the Estates supported the King in naming Christian as heir apparent. He was publicly hailed in 1610, both in Denmark and Norway. Titled Tugtmester, Niels J√∏rgensen √Üryleus (1610-1617) and Jesper Brochmand (1617-1620) were responsible for educating the Prince. Leading the principal court, Christian Friis til Kragerup was Hofmester (1615-1616), succeeded by Christian Thomesen Sehested in 1616.  Career and marriage  In 1625, Denmark ventured into the Thirty Years' War. The Danish Intervention saw the war entering its second main phase, after the end of the Bohemian Revolt. With King Christian IV commanding on the battlefield, Prince Christian was installed as acting head of government. Christian held this post to 1627, but not without entering the battlefield in the meantime. He was even hit by two gunshots in November 1626. In 1627 he was sent to Holstein near the frontier, where he took seat in Segeberg. He later retreated when enemy troops overran South Denmark and Jutland, as the Danish Intervention failed. During this process he even broke a leg after a fall from a wagon. In 1626, his relationship with the noble Anne Lykke caused a conflict with his father and the Council of the Realm when his father arrested Lykke because of her influence on him and tried to have her charged with sorcery. In 1628, Christian received the fief of Malm√∏hus. In January 1632, he was appointed Governor-General of the Danish parts of Schleswig and Holstein. He also received Laaland and Falster. In 1633, Christian was engaged to Magdalene Sibylle, daughter of Elector John George I of Saxony; the marriage had been discussed as early as 1630. The wedding took place on 5 October 1634 in Copenhagen among great festivities. The marriage was childless, and they resided at Nyk√∏bing Castle in Falster. Christian was not much involved on the political scene in this phase of his life, partly to his own dismay, but he did act as head of government in 1644, when the King was absent due to the Torstenson War. In the autumn of 1644, Prince Christian had a stay in the fortified Malm√∏, but Swedish forces threatened the city, and Christian retreated, first to Copenhagen due to illness, then to Falster.  Later life and legacy  Christian gained a reputation as lazy and as a drinker.Christian the Prince Elect He was heavily indebted; despite his father's attempts to pay some of Christian's debts, he still owed more than 215,000 rigsdaler in 1647. Among others, he took a loan from the Duke of Gottorp in 1646 in order to finance a stay in a Bohemian spa. He left Nyk√∏bing for Bohemia on 8 May 1647. He reached Dresden on 28 May, and continued on 1 June. Not long after leaving he was struck by a fit of illness. He was brought to a castle in Gorbitz near Dresden, where he died on the next day. He was buried on 8 November 1647 in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen. In 1655, his remains were moved to the tombs at Roskilde Cathedral.

On July 5, 1968 through Municipal Resolution No. 80, it became the ‚ÄúMalita High School\\" which offered a complete secondary curriculum. In 1969, a Marcos‚Äìtype building with 10 rooms was constructed in a two-hectare lot donated by Mrs. Juanita De Salmon. On February 8, 1982 through Batas Pambansa Bilang 148, the Malita High School was converted into a state college known as the ‚ÄúMalita Agri-Business and Marine and Aquatic School of Technology‚Äù (MAMAST). This was the realization of then Assemblyman Benjamin V. Bautista's dream of education. Engr. Ramon M. Barbon became the first College President. On March 9, 1984, the Batas Pambansa Bilang 65 changed the name of MAMAST to ‚ÄúSouthern Philippines Agri-Business, Marine and Aquatic School of Technology (SPAMAST)‚Äù to expand its scope and interest in the fields of agriculture and fisheries. Since then, SPAMAST has flourished and acquired significant properties that are now sites for the realization of its mission and vision. In 1989, SPAMAST acquired an 8-hectare land in Buhangin, Malita which is now the College of Agricultural Sciences (CAS) Campus. In 1992, the Provincial Government of Davao del Sur donated a 5.4-hectare land in Brgy. Matti, Digos City for the establishment of the Digos Campus. In 1993, a 1.5-hectare land was acquired by the college along the shoreline fronting the Malita Campus. In 2019, by virtue of Republic Act 11220 the Digos Campus was separated and converted to Davao del Sur State College.

Congressman Lorenzo Sarmiento and Senator Alejandro Almendras initiated legislation that led to the creation of the Davao del Norte School of Fisheries (DANSOF) on April 29, 1969 by virtue of Republic Act 5876. Plans were on hiatus for six years due to lack of budgetary allocation; Tranquilino Benigno worked for the inclusion of DANSOF in the annual budget. On January 5, 1976, DANSOF started its operation within the compound of Panabo Provincial High School (PPHS). In 1979, the Davao Regional Institute of Fisheries Technology (DRIFT) was established at DaNSoF, having been chosen among the seven fishery schools under the 6th IBRD Fishery Education Development Program. Upon the retirement of Benigno as DRIFT director and DANSOF administrator, Dr. Vicente Hermoso was appointed on December 15, 1992 as vocational school superintendent. The school was converted to the Davao del Norte State College (DNSC) on February 14, 1995, through the Republic Act 787] authored by Congressman Rodolfo del Rosario. Hermoso became the first president of DNSC. 21st century developments On October 30, 2001, Dr. Edgardo M. Santos became the second president of DNSC. Under his presidency, Santos worked on the foundations established by earlier administrators and initiated a research consortium which led to DNSC becoming the locus for the Department of Science and Technology -- Philippine Council for Marine and Aquatic Research and Development (DOST-PCAMRD) Zonal Center V. Academic programs and administrative policies were revisited and upgraded which led to the growth of the institution. By 2007, DNSC had four of its baccalaureate programs accredited: Bachelor of Science in Fisheries, Science in Marine Biology, Science in Information Technology, and Secondary Education. In 2009, three more programs were accredited: Ph.D. in Educational Management, Master of Arts in Educational Management and Bachelor of Science in Food Technology. In addition, the college serves as the Regional Training Center for Vermiculture and Vermicompost Production as a result of its collaboration with DOST-PCAMRRD. It is the coordinating and host institution for the Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Project of the DOST for the fisheries sector. Government agencies, private entrepreneurs and plantation owners linked to the college for technical collaboration. The college has been chosen as partner agency in Region XI of the Commission on Information and Communications Technology (CICT) for the development of ICT expertise in the country's human capital and enhance the competitiveness of Filipino workers in the global ICT market. Under this program, DNSC serves at least 23 schools in Davao del Norte, Compostela Valley, and Davao Oriental. In recognition of the college's developed manpower, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) established the college as an Assessment Center with its qualified faculty in the areas of Hardware Servicing NC II and PC Operations NC II. TESDA also chose the college as an assessment center for Aquaculture and Food Processing. In early 2010, the college was accorded by the Commission on Higher Education the National University or College in Agriculture and Fisheries (NUCAF) for Region XI. Among its recent accomplishments is the award as CHED Best Regional HEI Research Program for 2008 for its Biodiversity and Environment program. A component of this program is a CHED-funded project on the Conservation of the Endangered Giant Clams Tridacna Squamosa and Tridacna Gigas: A Strategy for Environmental Protection under the CHED Commissioner Nenalyn Defensor's Save Our Shore (SOS) Program. In March 2011, the College was also awarded the CHED Best Regional Extension Program for its project, Development Interventions in the Island Garden of Samal.\\" This project revolves around community livelihood, cooperatives and harnessing community involvement in marine and environment protection. The college is headed by Dr. Jonathan A. Bayogan who was appointed as the third college president on December 14, 2010.

In the field of human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI), the term ludic Interfaces describes a discipline that focuses on user interfaces that are inherently \\"playful\\". This field of interface research and design draws on concepts introduced by Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga in the book Homo Ludens (\\"Man the Player\\" or \\"Playing Man\\"). Huizinga's work is considered an important contribution to the development of game studies. The various tools and concepts associated with ludic interface development differ from mainstream technological systems that employ human computer interfacing and interaction. Ludic interfaces tend to be more playful, are user-generated and user-driven, flexible, low-cost and cooperative. Such interfaces are often experimental and draw upon methods and knowledge from video game design, interactive media, modding cultures, media conversion, and social networking. The goal of ludic interface design is to create interfacing technology that offers ease of use and is inherently playful. Core concept At its core, \\"ludic interfaces\\" is a subcategory of interfaces in general. The notion is not restricted to electronics or human‚Äìcomputer interaction, even if the terminology was developed in respect to digital technology. Various authors suggest to use the term \\"ludic interfaces\\" for non-digital phenomena, e.g. architectural facades, skins, wearable computers, media art. \\"Ludic Interfaces\\" is also a Masters programme development on a European level. It is the title of a European collaboration in creating a network of academic institutions and of world leading media centres to investigate, design and test publicly shared digital content. The programme development is a joint project by the University of Potsdam, Universidad Polit√©cnica de Valencia, Universit√§t f√ºr k√ºnstlerische und industrielle Gestaltung in Linz, and by the University of Salford in Greater Manchester. History Ludic interface design was first defined in 2002 by William Gaver, in \\"Designing for Homo Ludens\\", expanded in a later article in 2009. The term was revisited in 2008 by International Symposium on Electronic Art) curators Gunalan Nadarajan and Vladimir Todoroviƒá to describe a panel section of ISEA2008 in Singapore. The term was introduced with the aim of counterbalancing the tendency of \\"infantilization of play\\" and stressing the \\"complicities between technology and pleasure\\". In the same year a group of game artists and scholars at Leuphana University in Lueneburg started lecturing and writing about the theory of Ludic Interfaces and applied for a European grant to develop a Masters programme in Ludic Interfaces.An interview about Ludic Interfaces by Digital Arts and Architecture Lab with Mathias Fuchs can be found on http://inm.de/index.cfm?siteid=190&CFID;=3969946&CFTOKEN;=5bbbde746c0b288f-653F9F40-A892-243B-D200A47407920729&jsessionid;=80308ba15754$1E$2F$3 The application was successful and the development has successfully been completed in 2013. The notion of \\"ludic interfaces\\" has also historical roots in artistic practice and analysis of interfaces (cf. Christa Sommerer, Laurent Mignonneau), the notion of \\"playfulness\\" as a design and arts strategy, or the \\"Ludic Society\\" arts organisation. Examples Ludic interface experiment by student Jess Kilby from University of Salford, using RFID tag technology for a digital tarot reader.Ludic interface by Mathias Fuchs, using Djing tools in combination with a game engine: \\"postvinyl\\" Jess Kilby‚Äôs RFID Tarot table consists of a hand-painted black table with letters and signs drawn upon it, and a white set of cards containing radio-frequency tags. The installation is an example for a ludic set-up where the interface contributes significantly to the magic of the game. Hidden information within the blank cards allows the RFID reader, a digital tarot reader automaton, to interpret information hidden from the human eye. Kilby‚Äôs system interprets the information contained within the cards and displays videos of a frightening future. The game could certainly be implemented as a Flash simulation or be built for a 2D monitor display system, but without the materiality of the ludic interface, without the special lighting, and without the artist dressed in a fortune teller‚Äôs dress the game would not work at all. The same holds true for Mary Flanagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúGiant Joystick‚Äù. It is the interface with all its materiality, erotic connotations and haptic features which makes the ludic installation work so well. Ludic interfaces can also facilitate play in a musical sense. The \\"postvinyl\\" performance, originally commissioned by futuresonic festival Manchester in 2004 recontextualizes a computer game in a performance environment.

Its native habitat is the temperate waters of the northern Pacific, from Puget Sound to Alaska (overlapping the range of the rock sole), the Aleutian Islands and across the Bering Sea to the Kuril Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk (overlapping the range of the dusky sole). Males grow up to in length, whilst females can reach . The maximum recorded lifespan is 18 years. Taxonomy and nomenclature Prior to 2000 the Northern rock sole and the rock sole, Lepidopsetta bilineata, were considered to be a single species under the genus Lepidopsetta, but work by Orr & Matarese published in 2000 reorganised the genus into three separate taxa. As a result of this reclassification and renaming, the rock sole L. bilineata may be referred to as the \\"southern\\" rock sole, in order to avoid confusion with the Northern rock sole L. polyxystra. Role in ecosystem The Northern rock sole occupies a moderately high trophic level in the food chain. Diet The diet of the Northern rock sole consists mainly of zoobenthos polychaetes and amphipods. Predators Northern rock sole are eaten by marine mammals and other fish, including sharks, Alaska pollock, yellowfin sole, Pacific halibut and Pacific cod. Reproduction Northern rock sole reach reproductive maturity at between 4 and 7 years old, and spawn in winter through to early spring. Eggs are demersal and stick to the surface on which they are laid; hatching takes from 6 to 25 days. Commercial fishing Northern rock sole is fished commercially, and forms an important part of two trawl fisheries in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Although it was overfished in the 1960s stocks have recovered, and the biomass of Northern rock sole in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands fishery is now estimated to be very high, at twice the level required to support maximum sustainable yield. In 2008 the estimated Northern rock sole biomass in the Gulf of Alaska fishery was some 102,303 tons, compared to catches ranging from 453 tons in 2004 to 4,330 tons in 2006.

The birch-bark roof was the prevailing roof type in rural Finland up until the 1860s, when it was replaced by the use of other materials such as metal sheeting and later roofing felt. The tradition of birch-bark roofs has been revived in recent years as a craft in connection with the restoration of old farm buildings that have been converted into open-air museums. The main reason for using birch bark was that when added in several layers, it acts as an efficient water- and damp-proof course. The birch trees would normally be de-barked, using a knife, during the summer.The Seurasaari Open-Air Museum Guide. Edited by Raija J√§rvel√§-Hynynen. National Board of Antiquities, Helsinki, 1996. The birch bark itself does not form the top layer of the roof. Once the main log frame of the building is constructed, the main horizontal roof poles are laid down; after this comes thin timber slats placed at right-angles to the base roof poles. On top of these then come the layers of birch-bark, each row overlapping the next. The number of layers could vary from 2 to 6 depending on the building. On top of the birch-bark layers were then placed long heavy wooden poles (usually de- barked young trees). The poles on either side of the pitched roof would be interlocked at the roof ridge. The poles were held in place at the eaves by an eaves board. The poles nearest the end gable would further be fixed with tree- root bindings. Furthermore, rocks were often placed on the roof to further add weight.Murtovaara. A crown forest croft. Karjalaisten Kulttuuri, Kuopio, 2008.

Subspecies recognized in this species include: * Biomphalaria tenagophila tenagophila (d‚ÄôOrbigny, 1835) * Biomphalaria tenagophila guaibensis Paraense, 1984  Biomphalaria tenagophila guaibensis can be distinguished from the nominal subspecies according to the details on the reproductive system only. There are also three \\"old-style\\" proposals of subspecies, based on shell characteristics: * Planorbis tenagophilus chemnitziana Beck, 1837 - this name is based on the catalog for the shell in Museum of Copenhagen, but without description. * Planorbis tenagophilus orbignyana Beck, 1837 - the same situation as in P. t. chemnitziana * Australorbis bahiensis megas Pilsbry, 1951 History of discoveries summarized Paraense (2001).Paraense W.

Mem√≥rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz 96(Supplement): 7-16. text , PDF  Phylogeny  A cladogram showing phylogenic relations of species in the genus Biomphalaria:  Distribution  Biomphalaria tenagophila is a Neotropical species and its native distribution include Peru, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. This species has recently expanded its native range. The non-indigenous distribution of Biomphalaria tenagophila includes a hypothermal spring near RƒÉbƒÉgani, Romania (46¬∞45¬¥1.3¬¥¬¥N, 22¬∞12¬¥44.8¬¥¬¥E).  Shell description  The shell is sinistrally coiled (has left-handed coiling). The flat shells are yellow-brown, discoidal, deeply and symmetrically biconcave, and consist of 5 or 6 slowly increasing whorls. The last whorl is rounded; the intermediate whorls are slightly angled on the left side. The aperture is circular or slightly ovate and angled toward the left side of the shell (i.e., toward the upper surface on the bottom right shell). Fine, parallel, rib-like transverse lines can be seen on the outer surface of the whorls. The width of the shell is usually from 11 to 13 mm, but in the largest individuals, the shell can reach 21 mm in width, 6.5 mm in height and have 6.5 whorls. { A shell of Biomphalaria tenagophila. spire is on top and the umbilicus at the bottom in this image } Reproductive system of Biomphalaria tenagophila.

Anatomy  The anatomy of this species was firstly published under the synonym Australorbis nigricans in 1955. The body length varies from 56 mm to 64 mm. The radula has from 125 to 168 rows of denticles (tiny teeth). The number of lateral teeth varying from 28 to 36. The mode radula formula is 31-0-31. The specific characteristics of the reproductive system of Biomphalaria tenagophila are: more than 200 diverticulae of the ovotestis; 7‚Äì11 main lobes of the prostate; and presence of vaginal pouch.  Ecology  Habitat of Biomphalaria tenagophila is tropical standing water or freshwater. Biomphalaria tenagophila is an intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni and a vector of schistosomiasis. Schistosoma mansoni came to Neotropics from Africa in context of the slave trade. Schistosoma mansoni was not able to infect Biomphalaria tenagophila in 1916 and it has adapted to this host since 1916.

Design The APAV 40 is a dual purpose, anti-personnel (AP) and anti-vehicle (AV), 40 mm rifle-grenade. It has a mass of 405 grams, and a tail with stabilizing fins. Explosion is triggered by an impact fuse. Two versions of the APAV 40 exist: * the older F1 model which must be fired with a blank cartridge * the current F2 model which uses a bullet-trap that allows using live rounds Use Alidade sight system of the FAMAS for direct fire of the APAV40 To launch, the APAV40 F2 is placed over the muzzle of a FAMAS or any NATO rifle with a (22 mm) STANAG muzzle device. Then the rifle is aimed at the target and fired. The impact of the bullet striking the bullet-trap and the expanding gases launch and arm the grenade, which explodes on impact. In its antipersonnel capacity, the APAV 40 is used in indirect fire. The APAV 40 has a lethal radius of 12 metres and its shrapnel is dangerous up to 100 metres away. In its anti-vehicle capacity, the APAV 40 is used in direct fire. Under an optimal angle, the APAV 40 is capable of piercing 100 mm of armour. The FAMAS provides an alidade sight for launching the grenade from 75 or 100 metres. The FAMAS can also be inclined/angled by 45¬∞, to allow fire from 170 to 320 metres, with 20-metre increments; or by 74¬∞, to allow fire from 60 to 170 metres, with 10-metre increments.

He serves as adjunct professor at School of Architecture, Tsinghua University, and the visiting professor at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Early life and background Ma Yansong was born in Beijing in 1975. He graduated from the Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, and holds a master's degree in Architecture from Yale University. He is currently a professor at the Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. During his master's degree in Yale, he first received attention for his project \\"Floating Islands\\". He founded MAD Architects in 2004. Design philosophy: Shanshui City The famous Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen proposed the concept of \\"Shanshui City\\" in the 1980s. In view of the emerging large-scale cement construction, he put forward a new model of urban development based on Chinese Shanshui spirit, which was meant to allow people to \\"stay out of nature and return to nature.\\" However, this idealistic urban concept was not put into practice. As the world's largest manufacturing base, a large number of soulless \\"shelf cities\\" appeared in contemporary China due to the lack of cultural spirit. Qian Xuesen pointed out that modern cities' worship of power and capital leads to maximization and utilitarianism. \\"Buildings in cities should not become living machines. Even the most powerful technology and tools can never endow the city with a soul.\\" To Ma Yansong, Shanshui does not just refer to nature; it is also the individual's emotional response to the surrounding world. \\"Shanshui City\\" is a combination of city density, functionality and the artistic conception of natural landscape. It aims at composing a future city that takes human spirit and emotion at their cores.

They feed on colonial cnidarians such as Portuguese man o' wars, blue buttons, and purple sails. They can produce painful and potentially dangerous stings when handled, as they store the venomous nematocysts of their prey. Glaucus is the only genus in the family Glaucidae. It includes five species. Taxonomic history The genus Glaucus was established by monotypy in 1777 by the British naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster. He described specimens of Glaucus atlanticus recovered during the second voyage of James Cook aboard . The genus is named after the Greek sea-god Glaucus. In 1848, the German naturalist Johannes Gistel provided the substitute name Dadone for Glaucus. But it is unnecessary and is now regarded as invalid.Bouchet, P. (2015). Dadone Gistel, 1848. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2015-09-23 The family Glaucidae was established in 1827 by the British zoologist John Edward Gray to contain the genus. A second species in the family was described by the Danish malacologist Rudolph Bergh in 1860. He placed it under a new genus Glaucilla. However, the synapomorphies between Glaucus and Glaucilla have made the maintenance of both genera irrelevant. Therefore Glaucus is now regarded as the only genus within the family Glaucidae.Vald√©s A. & Campillo O.A.

It is a designer, developer and manufacturer that specialises in providing API-driven, enabling technology sub-systems for telecommunications related OEM products such as are used in fixed line PSTN, wireless and VoIP networks. Aculab's products are sold worldwide, primarily through direct sales and also via the reseller channel. Aculab's headquarters and R&D; facilities are located in Milton Keynes, UK. It has a branch office in Norwood, Massachusetts, USA.  Brief company history  In 1978, Aculab was a design consultancy involved in the music industry. Soon after the first microprocessors were introduced, it began to design and manufacture intelligent interfaces and controllers for computer peripherals. In 1988, Aculab turned to building analogue speech processing sub-systems for a number of clients, such as British Telecom. In 1991, Aculab began to ship the first E1 interface cards for the UK and German markets. These PC Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) form factor cards enabled PC-based speech processing products to be connected to digital public switched telephone network (PSTN) networks. The expansion of its product capabilities to include the physical interfaces and telecommunications protocols (Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), channel-associated signaling (CAS) and Signaling System 7 (SS7)) needed to reach a broader, worldwide market, helped to establish Aculab as one of the pioneers of the computer telephony industry. Later, in 1997, Aculab introduced its own ISA speech processing board, the first of its portfolio of digital signal processor (DSP)-based voice boards. And it was in 1998 that Aculab introduced a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) product, the first combined trunk card and voice board ‚Äì Prosody PCI. It was novel for its time, delivering up to 240 speech channels and 4 E1/T1 trunk interfaces on a single card at a time when the standard was 24 to 30 channels. A Prosody cPCI (CompactPCI) version followed in 2000. During 1993, Aculab introduced Groomer, a protocol converter that enabled interconnection between disparate telephone networks running incompatible protocols. In 2002, the product was relaunched as GroomerII, a signalling and media gateway that can be used for connection between equipment and applications deployed in time-division multiplexing (TDM) and Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Aculab's GIII gateway is the third generation evolution in the product line. In 2003, Aculab introduced Prosody S, a host media processing (HMP) alternative to traditional, DSP-based voice boards, for IP-based OEM products. http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/News/Industry-News/Aculab-Announces- Development-of-Host-Media-Processing-Resource--30273.aspx The ApplianX range of gateways was launched by Aculab in 2007. Aculab Cloud - a cloud-based telephony API service platform - was launched in 2011.  Currently offered products   Prosody X  Prosody X is a DSP-based media processing platform that offers the low level functions and technologies typically used by OEMs in their end-user product lines. Those enabling technologies include VoIP, SIP, fax, conferencing, and narrow and wideband (HD Voice) codecs. Aculab's DSP-based platforms include integral E1/T1 interfaces with CAS, ISDN and SS7 signalling and protocol support. Aculab's SS7 stack includes ISUP, signalling monitoring, and non-call related TCAP signalling functionality.  Prosody S  Prosody S is an IP-based, software-only host media processing (HMP) product that offers a range of media server technologies, including VoIP, SIP, T.38 fax, conferencing, and narrow and wideband (HD Voice) codecs, under a software licence.  The GIII gateway  The GIII gateway is a signalling and media gateway, primarily intended for the service provider and the Emergency_service markets. The gateway enables interworking between SIP- based networks or ESInets, applications and entities, and legacy, TDM-based wired and wireless networks running CAS, ISDN or SS7 (C7) protocols. The GIII gateway is the successor to Aculab's long-established GroomerII gateway, and was introduced in the spring of 2018.  ApplianX  The ApplianX IP Gateway is an enterprise scale gateway offering interoperability between SIP-based networks and entities, TDM-based PBXs and the PSTN. The gateway includes SIP, QSIG and DPNSS interworking functionality, with Supplementary Services support, which capability is needed by the legacy enterprise PBX/IP-PBX market in the UK (with DPNSS) and elsewhere (with QSIG).

He was born in Grand Bank and was educated there, in St. John's, at Frazee Business College in Halifax, at Mount Allison University and at Dalhousie University. He articled in law and was called to the Nova Scotia bar in 1899 and then was called to the Newfoundland bar, entering practice with James A. Winter. Foote ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Newfoundland assembly in 1904. He served in the Executive Council as a minister without portfolio. Foote and three other cabinet members resigned from cabinet in 1923 after Richard Squires refused to remove Alexander Campbell, who had been accused of misuse of government funds, from the Executive Council. He later served again as a minister without portfolio in the government of William Warren. He was defeated when he ran for election to the assembly for Burin West in 1928 but then was elected again in 1932.

It is located where Seel Street meets Berry Street in Liverpool City Centre. It is a venue in Liverpool in which the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and many other bands played at in the 1960s. It was historically a jazz club, but it now plays pop music. History Blue Angel Night Club, Seel Street, Liverpool The building in which the club is situated was the birthplace in 1805 of Dr William Henry Duncan and a plaque above the door commemorates this. The Beatles' original manager Allan Williams was once the owner of the club and reputedly ejected Judy Garland after the local premiere of their first film A Hard Day's Night in 1964. Pete Best's audition to join the Beatles took place in the Blue Angel on 12 August 1960. It was also where the Beatles, in 1960, auditioned for impresario Larry Parnes landing them their first tour outside Liverpool, supporting singer Johnny Gentle on a tour of Scotland. After seeing Cilla Black performing \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" at the Blue Angel, Brian Epstein contracted Black as his only female client on 6 September 1963. The Blue Angel today The Blue Angel is especially popular with students, however the club attracts people from a wide range of ages and backgrounds, with people who attended the club in the 1990s still regularly visiting to this day. Monday nights are seen as one of the most popular nights for students to visit, and this coupled with the club holding an extended late night opening license means it is a draw with students. The club has two main floors and an outside seating area. The lower floor has DJ equipment and a dance floor, whilst the upper floor has more seating and a more bar orientated feel. One popular drink available at the club is a 'Fat Frog' made by mixing a Smirnoff Ice, a Blue WKD and an Orange Bacardi Breezer. In 2008, DJ equipment was seized from the club, following a series of complaints from local residents about noise levels, since the clientele had to smoke outside the club following the introduction of the smoking ban. The Blue Angel was banned from using its backyard. A support network, set up mainly by students and boasting a website was created in order to \\"Save the Raz\\" from closure. In 2010 the Blue Angel won the court battle to remain open and operate as normal.

There is a previous reference to another count in √Ålava called Eylo who in 868 led a rebellion that was quashed by King Alfonso III of Asturias and then taken to Oviedo in chains. Nevertheless, the references to Count Vela, the head of this lineage, are much more precise.  Family origins He is assumed to have been a member of the royal house of Pamplona and a member of the Jimena dynasty and a relative of King Alfonso III and perhaps his brother-in-law. This placement is based solely on his common patronymic, and there is no documentary evidence whatsoever to support such relationships.  Count in √Ålava  The first count of Castile was Rodrigo who governed the County of Castile by mandate of King Ordo√±o I of Asturias and, according to documentary sources, it seems that the authority of this Castilian count and later that of his son Diego included parts of √Ålava, although it was not until 882 when someone held that title. By 882, the county was being governed by Rodrigo's son, Diego, while Vela Jim√©nez appears in 882 and in 883 in charge of the government of √Ålava:Vigila Scemeniz erat tunc comes in Alaba In 882, while Count Diego defended the gorge at Pancorbo, Count Vela was responsible for defending the County of √Ålava from the castle at Cellorigo, from where he blocked the passage and defeated the Muslim forces led by Al-Mundhir of C√≥rdoba at the Battle of Cellorigo.  Possible descendants  La Rioja, former site of the Castle of Cellorigo Although there is no document to confirm it, he is assumed to have been the father of: * Munio V√©laz, who appears from 913 as the count in √Ålava and in 919 as Monnio Uigilazi in Alaba in the Cartularios de Valpuesta. Because of his patronymic and his title, he was probably one of Count Vela's sons. He could also have been same Munio who appears in the C√≥dice de Roda as Count Momo Biscahiensis, that is, count in Biscay. * Nu√±o V√©laz. The medieval scholar Jaime de Salazar y Acha suggests that Count Vela could have been the father of a son named Nu√±o who settled in the Kingdom of Le√≥n after the descendants of Count Vela Jimenez fled from Castile due to their differences with the Castilian count Fern√°n Gonz√°lez, and became ancestor of the Vela (or V√©laz) family. According to the author, this would explain the Basque names such as Vela and Oveco in subsequent generations. This Nu√±o would have been the father of several children, including counts Vela N√∫√±ez, Bermudo N√∫√±ez, the first Count of Cea, and Oveco N√∫√±ez, Bishop of Le√≥n. * Aaron Alberto Vela, author of The Magical Train (Aarthscape), may be a possible descendant based on his patronymical names which have traceable roots to the Castile region.

It is in the Renaissance architectural tradition. The cathedral is located within the limits defined by a now missing portion of the medieval Moorish walls, the remains of which surround the nearby Alcazaba and the Castle of Gibralfaro. It was constructed between 1528 and 1782, following the plans drawn by Diego de Siloe; its interior is also in Renaissance style. Description Lateral view of M√°laga Cathedral in the 18th century The cathedral, built on a rectangular plan, is composed of a nave and two aisles, the former being wider, though having the same height as the aisles. The choir stalls are the work of Pedro de Mena. The fa√ßade, unlike the rest of the building, is in Baroque style and is divided into two levels; on the lower level are three arches, inside of which are portals separated by marble columns. Above the doors are medallions carved in stone; those of the lateral doors represent the patron saints of M√°laga, Saint Cyriacus and Saint Paula, while that over the centre represents the Annunciation. The north tower is high, making this building the second-highest cathedral in Andalusia, after the Giralda of Seville. The south tower remains unfinished. A plaque at the base of the tower states that funds raised by the parish to finish it were used instead to help those British colonies which became the United States to gain their independence from Great Britain. Examinations of the parish registers indicate, however, that the money may have been used instead to renovate the roadway called the \\"Way of Antequera\\" (which began in the present street Calle Martinez Maldonado). This unfinished state has led to the cathedral being called \\"La Manquita\\", meaning in English, \\"The One-Armed Lady\\".http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/172623/0/catedral/goteras/hay/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/247598/0/obras/catedral/malaga/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/349183/0/rstauracion/cubierta/catedral/ A series of grand artworks fills the sanctuary, among them are the Gothic altarpiece of the Chapel of Santa Barbara and the 16th century tombs of the Chapel of San Francisco. The Chapel of the Incarnation contains a neoclassic altarpiece (1785) designed by the sculptor Juan de Villanueva and carved by Antonio Ramos and Aldehuela, a group of figures representing the Annunciation and sculptures of the patron saints of Malaga, Saint Ciriaco and Saint Paula, carved by Juan Salazar Palomino also in the 18th century, and The Beheading of Saint Paul, painted by Enrique Simonet in 1887 during his stay in Rome.

South-east, long side with Apostles gate Schillerplatz. History and structure Recent research found structures of a small Romanesque church dating to the 10th and 11th centuries within the outline of today's church. In 1240, a stately three-naved church with two towers was built in the Romanic style, apparently by the Counts of W√ºrttemberg who from around that time were residing in the nearby Old Castle. The remains of Ulrich I, Count of W√ºrttemberg and his second wife, Countess of W√ºrttemberg, Agnes von Schlesien-Liegnitz (both died in 1265) rest in a double tomb in the south tower chapel that dates to the late 13th century. When Stuttgart became the new residence of the rulers of W√ºrttemberg, they added a new Gothic chancel between 1321 to 1347. Ulrich V added a Late Gothic nave in the second half of the 15th century. In 1500, a coloured, later (from the 19th century) golden pulpit was added. With the adoption of the Lutheran Protestant Reformation in W√ºrttemberg in 1534, all pictures and altars were removed from the naves, pewage and a gallery were added. The tombstones were moved to the interior of the church. The Lutheran reformer Johannes Brenz, the main Protestant Reformer of W√ºrttemberg, was buried under the chancel after his death in 1570. From 1574, small statues of all the Counts of W√ºrttemberg (i.e. since Ulrich I) were added at the North wall of the chancel. In 1608, a new grave crypt or burial vault was added. All of the W√ºrttemberg rulers until 1677 were buried there. Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, Queen of W√ºrttemberg from 1816 until 1819, was buried here from 1819 to 1824, before her remains were brought to a mausoleum on the W√ºrttemberg mountain. In 1826, the roof of the chancel was renovated, as was most of the interior of the church in the 1840s. Near the end of World War II, the church was heavily damaged by the bombing raids on Stuttgart in 1944. The church was rebuilt in the 1950s, however, the interior was rebuilt in a modern style.

A West Point graduate who learned to fly in 1915-16, he served with the 1st Aero Squadron in the Pancho Villa Expedition and later led it on the Western Front. During World War II as a brigadier general, he led the Royce special mission to Mindanao, in which a small force of bombers flew from Australia to attack Japanese targets in the Philippines. Later he was Deputy Commander of the Ninth Air Force and commanded the 1st Provisional Tactical Air Force. Early life Ralph Royce was born in Marquette, Michigan on 28 June 1890 and attended school at Hancock, Michigan. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point on 1 March 1910. Royce graduated 12 June 1914, ranked 89th in merit in a class of 107 cadets, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 26th Infantry. In 1915, he was detailed to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps (ASSC) and sent to the Signal Corps Aviation School at Rockwell Field, California, for pilot training. On graduation on 16 May 1916, he was rated a Junior Military Aviator and promoted to temporary first lieutenant in the ASSC. World War I Then Major Ralph Royce (left) with Brigadier General Benjamin Foulois in France 1918 Royce was posted to the 1st Aero Squadron, which was then serving on the Mexican border in support of the Pancho Villa Expedition. He briefly commanded the squadron in March 1917, before being promoted to captain in May 1917. In August 1917, he assumed command of the squadron again, taking it to the Western Front. There, he was promoted to major in June 1918 and lieutenant colonel in August as commander of the 1st Observation Group. For his service in France, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre with the citation: \\"Commanding the 1st American Observation Escadrille, he insisted on making the first reconnaissance above the enemy lines himself. Gives to his pilots generally an example of admirable dash and intrepidity.\\" Between the wars Royce experienced the chaotic ups and downs in rank common to Regular officers in 1920, when the National Defense Act of 1920 reorganized the military. He first reverted to his permanent rank of captain of Infantry 1 March 1920 when his temporary ranks expired. On 1 July 1920, when the Air Service became a combatant arm of the line, he formally transferred to the branch, with promotion to major by virtue of a provision in the Act that allowed officers who earned their rank in service with the AEF to retain it. On 18 December 1922 he was discharged when Congress set a new ceiling on the number of majors authorized the Air Service, and reappointed as a captain, then promoted again to major on 11 July 1923. From 1920 to 1926 he was commanding officer of the primary flying school at Carlstrom Field, Arcadia, Florida. In 1926 he was transferred to Langley for duty as a student at the Air Corps Tactical School. He then became commandant of Brooks Field, San Antonio, Texas. He then went to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas as a student in the Command and General Staff College. From 1928 to 1930, he commanded the 1st Pursuit Group at Selfridge Field. Michigan. In January 1930 Royce commanded the 1st Pursuit Group in a flight across the northern United States from Selfridge Field to Spokane, Washington and back in what became known as the \\"Arctic Patrol\\" flight, in order to put \\"pursuit tactics to the acid test under extremely rigorous weather conditions, and to afford a very broad opportunity for testing flying equipment in zero temperatures\\". For this, Royce won the Mackay Trophy. In July and August 1934, he piloted one of ten Martin B-10 bombers from Washington, DC to Fairbanks, Alaska and back, as Operations Officer for an expedition led by Henry H. Arnold, for which Arnold won the Mackay trophy. In February 1935 he led the 1st Pursuit Group in a series of a cold weather flights through the northern states where the airmen encountered blizzards, and subzero temperatures. He attended the Army War College from 1933 to 1934, after which he resumed command of the 1st Pursuit Group. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935. From 1937 to 1939, he served as Air Officer of the Philippine Department. On returning to the United States in 1939 he assumed command of the 7th Bombardment Group at Hamilton Field CA. World War II Royce was promoted to colonel on 1 March 1940. He assumed command of the 20th Bombardment Wing at Fort Douglas, Utah in March 1941 and was promoted to brigadier general in April. In May 1941 he became Assistant Military Attach√© at the American Embassy in London. In July 1941 he became Military Attach√© for Air. Special mission in the Philippines In January 1942, Royce was posted to Australia as Chief of the Air Staff, US Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA). In March 1942, the commander of US Forces in the Philippines, Lieutenant General Jonathan Wainwright, asked that a squadron of bombers be sent to the Philippines to break the Japanese blockade and allow supplies to be moved from Cebu to Corregidor. A conference was held in Melbourne on 7 April and plans were drawn up. Royce commanded the mission in person, which consisted of ten B-25 Mitchell medium bombers of the 3rd Bomb Group and three B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers of the 19th Bomb Group. The force took off from Darwin on 11 April and flew to Del Monte Airfield on Mindanao. All the planes arrived safely and the B-25s were dispersed to concealed P-40 Warhawk airstrips at Valencia and Maramag. Royce inexplicably declined to disperse the B-17s, and one was damaged by an air attack on Del Monte during the subsequent mission after it had been left behind for repairs. After the other two B-17s returned from the mission, they too were caught in the open on the ground and damaged, while the original bomber was destroyed. During missions on April 12 and 13, the force carried out a series of small air strikes against shipping and harbor facilities at Cebu, the harbor and airstrips at Davao, and Nichols Field on Luzon, the B-17s flying only two sorties while the B-25s conducted more than twenty. They then returned safely to Australia with evacuees, including U.S. Navy Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley. For leading the mission, Royce was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Subsequent war service In the May 1942 organization of South West Pacific Area, Royce became senior air staff officer, Allied Air Forces. He was promoted to major general in June 1942. Royce returned to the United States in September 1942 and assumed command of the South Eastern Training Center at Maxwell Field in Montgomery, Alabama. He commanded the First Air Force from April to September 1943. From September 1943 to March 1944, he was commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Middle East. On March 1944, Royce returned to the United Kingdom as Deputy Commander of the Ninth Air Force to Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton and later Major General Hoyt Vandenberg. He commanded the 1st Tactical Air Force (Provisional) from October 1944 to January 1945, operating in support of the Sixth United States Army Group. He then commanded the Personnel Distribution Command at Louisville, Kentucky until August 1945. Royce was married again in Detroit in February 1945, this time to Agnes Berges an ex-Manhattan hotel executive and overseas Red Cross worker. Post-war Royce received a disability retirement from the military in July 1946. He died of leukemia on 7 August 1965 at the Homestead Air Force Base Hospital in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

It first came to widespread attention among archaeologists with the publication of Christopher Tilley's A Phenomenology of Landscape (1994), in which he suggested it to be a useful technique that can be used to discover more about historical peoples and how they interact with the landscapes in which they live. He argued that, simply by looking at two-dimensional depictions of a landscape, such as on a map, archaeologists fail to understand how peoples living in hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies actually relate to those areas. He believed, therefore, that investigators should enter the very landscape that they are studying, and use their senses of sight, smell, and hearing to learn more about how historical peoples would have interpreted it. Phenomenology \\"has provoked considerable discussion within the discipline\\",Br√ºck (2005:45) receiving considerable criticism from the archaeological community who deem it to be \\"unscientific\\" and \\"subjective\\".Hamilton & Whitehouse (2006:31-32) In contrast to this, it has also been supported by a great number of archaeologists and nowadays is often used in fieldwork alongside other, more traditional methods.

It was presented in 2009 as a full-length semi-documentary by Serge Bromberg. History The film depicts the extreme jealousy of a hotelier, Marcel (Serge Reggiani, then 42 years old), towards his wife, Odette (Romy Schneider, then 26 years old). It was shot partly in black-and-white, partly in colour. Clouzot selected the title as an allusion to Dante's Inferno, and the names Odette and Marcel refer to characters in Marcel Proust's novel √Ä la recherche du temps perdu.\\"Clouzot et Romy Schneider ressuscit√©s\\" by Fran√ßois-Guillaume Lorrain, Le Point (17 December 2007) Marcel is the narrator of the novel, Odette is Odette de Cr√©cy, Mme. Swann. Despite an unlimited budget from Columbia Pictures‚ÄîClouzot worked with three crews and 150 technicians‚Äîthe shooting was beset by severe problems: everyone suffered from the record heat during July in the Cantal region; the main actor Serge Reggiani claimed to be ill (Jean-Louis Trintignant was asked to replace him); the artificial lake below the Garabit viaduct, an important part of the location, was about to be emptied by the local authorities; then Clouzot suffered a heart attack and was hospitalised in Saint-Flour.

In 2009, Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea released a 94 minute documentary with material selected from 15 hours (185 reels) of found scenes under the name L'Enfer d'Henri-Georges Clouzot.\\"Clouzot's towering inferno\\" by Stuart Jeffries, The Guardian (29 October 2009) Bromberg was caught for two hours in a stalled elevator with a woman who turned out to be Clouzot's second wife, In√®s de Gonzalez. Upon learning the identity of the woman and of the existence of the footage, Bromberg convinced her to release it to make his film. The documentary includes interviews with nine cast and crew members, notably Catherine All√©gret, the production assistant from 1964, Costa Gavras, and the assistant cinematographer William Lubtchansky. Bromberg used the actors B√©r√©nice Bejo and Jacques Gamblin to shoot some scenes where dialogue had to be delivered; the found material, which included some 30 hours of soundtrack, didn't contain suitable material. The film was shown out-of-competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival,L'Enfer d'Henri-Georges Clouzot 2009 Cannes Film Festival at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, and film festivals in New York, Vancouver, London and Rotterdam; it was nationally released in France on 11 November 2009. In 2010 it received the C√©sar Award for Best Documentary.C√©sar Award nominations and winners Visual effects The film features several innovative and practical lighting techniques by Andr√©as Winding and Armand Thirard. Most notably in the psychedelic climax of the film, rotating lighting rigs were placed in-front of the camera and actors. The final effect created the illusion of the actors faces transitioning between emotions, and personalities. They would also slowly change their emotions intensifying the effect when synced to each rotation.

Unity was the eldest of three sisters; her two younger sisters were Ursula Ridgeway and Monica Resnick. She had one daughter, Deborah Ryan. Her niece is Lynn Johnston the comic artist of For Better or For Worse Bainbridge married in 1946, moved to San Francisco, CA for five years, then moved back to British Columbia. Unity was a long-time resident of West Vancouver, British Columbia. She died there on November 30, 2017 at the age of 101. Education Bainbridge studied in Vancouver at the then newly formed Vancouver School of Art from 1932-1936 under Grace Melvin and Charles Hepburn Scott. After graduating from the Vancouver School of Art, she attended the Cornish School of Art in Seattle briefly but returned to Canada within the year. Career Bainbridge, in the early 1930s trekked through a vast area of British Columbia's remote wilderness. She preferred to work alone and shunned most art groups. She was invited to join the Canadian Portrait Academy as a Founding Academician, but declined this offer. She met Lawren Harris in Vancouver in the 1930s and A.Y. Jackson in Toronto. In 1976-77 she compiled her research and images from repeated trips to communities between Pemberton and Lillooet. The works comprise Songs of Seton and Lullaby of Lillooet, two small books Bainbridge published in limited editions.\\" Bainbridge met some members of the Group of Seven, and considered Arthur Lismer and A.Y. Jackson among her many mentors. After returning from Seattle, Bainbridge made her living as a portrait painter in Vancouver. She felt strongly that portraits should be painted from the source, not from a photograph. This lead her to eventually start traveling around British Columbia painting portraits of people during the summers and then returning to Vancouver in the fall. She was especially drawn to paint portraits of the native community of northern B.C.

Cricket career Gove made her debut for South Africa in their maiden Test match. Facing the touring England at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth, Gove batted at number eight in the first innings and number nine in the second, scoring 4 and 40 runs respectively. Her bowling was also used in the match, and she claimed two wickets in the second innings, dismissing Katherine Smith caught and bowled, and trapping Ruth Westbrook leg before wicket. She scored 13 runs in the second match of the series, and did not take a wicket. She took wickets in both of the final two matches, collecting three at Durban and four in Cape Town, and though she did not surpass her innings of 40 runs from the first match, she did accumulate 90 runs across the two games.

With 80 floors and a height of 301 m, Tower A is the 18th tallest residential building in the world, and has been officially announced as the second tallest building in Korea, according to the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs. The Haeundae Doosan We‚Äôve the Zenith consists of three residential buildings, with 70, 75 and 80 stories respectively, comprising 1,788 households in total, and one office building on its site. The total construction work took 48 months from November 2007 to November 2011. Architecture and design The curves from the waves of the Haeundae beach, and Mt. Jang contribute to the design of the complex, and it is inspired by the shape of flower petals as well. The curved shape of the exterior allows residents views of Haeundae beach, Nurimaru and Gwangan Bridge. De Stefano & Partners, a specialist design firm in a field of high rise architecture, is credited for the architecture of Doosan We‚Äôve the Zenith; Jerde Partnership International designed the commercial building; and the SWA Group, which conducted the landscaping of the U.S. Disney World, carried out landscaping work of Haeundae Doosan We‚Äôve the Zenith. Structure and safety A structural health monitoring (SHM) system equipped with sensors that check wind load and earthquake load to the building in real time has been applied to Haeundae Doosan We‚Äôve the Zenith. The structural design was carried out by U.S. Thornton Tomasetti, a firm that also designed Taipei 101‚Äîa high-rise building in Taiwan. The Haeundae Doosan We‚Äôve the Zenith has a refuge area every three floors, which can be utilized as a resting area or a hanging garden under normal circumstances and is used as a refuge space in the event of emergency. To prevent spalling, which is the explosion that can occur when the concrete is exposed to high temperatures, the buildings were built with high strength concrete using a spalling failure prevention method. This technology was recognized with a New Construction Technology Certification from the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs in September 2008.

Plot In 1878, a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty (Paul Gross), known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States. He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell (Melody B. Choi), he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack (Tyler Mane), the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor (Sienna Guillory), one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk. In the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of Chinese railway workers to find out his whereabouts. By now - with the addition of a part repaired by the very blacksmith he intends to duel - Sean has finally fixed Jane's pistol. He proceeds to Jack's smithy to demand the duel, gives Jack the gun, and tells him to draw. However, Sean adjusts his aim so that he is pointing his six-shooter slightly to Jack's left (in a way that his shot will miss the blacksmith), providing an indication that he is done running and may want to die. The Kid tells Jack to pull the trigger, but the gun jams. The Kid takes the gun back from Jack to inspect it, but accidentally sets it off instead, with the ricocheting bullet hitting Jack in the left buttock (replicating the wound that the Kid himself had earlier in the film). After Dr. Angus Schiffron (Jay Brazeau) removes the fragmented bullet from Jack's buttock, the Kid agrees that he and the blacksmith are now even. He then prepares to leave town. As the Kid is riding out of town at one end, the bounty hunters are riding in behind him at the other end. They threaten the townsfolk in an effort to get them to turn over the Kid. The townsfolk instead train their rifles and shotguns on the bounty hunters with the intent of defending themselves. At this time, the Kid has returned, and, not wanting any more bloodshed, Sean tells bounty hunter leader Ben Cutler (Callum Keith Rennie) that he will go with them if Ben agrees to leave everyone else alone. Ben accepts, but right then town resident Larry (Michael Eklund) sets off a pile of dynamite that he has placed under a large tree stump by his farmhouse in an effort to get the stump out of the ground. This sets off confusion and sparks a gunfight between the bounty hunters on one side and Sean and the townsfolk on the other. The battle ultimately ends in the town's favour after the Kid takes out Ben's crew without killing any of them. The bounty hunters end up being escorted out of Canada by the local detachment of the North-West Mounted Police, and Sean decides to remain in town. He says he's staying because of a bunch of debts he has to pay off, but he really stays to be with Jane.

The metabolism of the cofactors Biotin and lipoic acid share this family. They also share the target modification domain (), and the sulfur insertion enzyme (). Biotin protein ligase (BPL) is the enzyme responsible for attaching biotin to a specific lysine at the biotin carboxyl carrier protein. Each organism likely has only one BPL protein. Biotin attachment is a two step reaction that results in the formation of an amide linkage between the carboxyl group of biotin and the epsilon-amino group of the modified lysine. Biotin attachment is required for biotin biosynthesis and utilization of free biotin. Lipoate-protein ligase catalyses the formation of an amide linkage between lipoic acid and a specific lysine residue of the lipoyl domain of lipoate dependent enzymes. They are required for the utilization of free lipoic acid. Octanoyl-(acyl carrier protein):protein N-octanoyltransferases, or octanoyltransferases, are required for lipoic acid biosynthesis. They transfer octanoate from the acyl carrier protein (ACP), part of fatty acid biosynthesis, to the specific lysine residue of lipoyl domains. Two octanoyltransferase isozymes exist in this superfamily. Lipoyl- protein:protein N-lipoyltransferases, or lipoylamidotransferases, are required for lipoic acid metabolism in some organisms. They transfer lipoic acid or octanoate from lipoyl domains and transfer to other lipoyl domains. In Bacillus subtilis, the transfer is from the glycine cleavage system H protein, GcvH, to other lipoyl domains. This is because the octanoyltransferase of B. subtilis is specific for GcvH. Structure Octanoyltransferases and lipoyl- amidotransferases are single domain enzymes. Characterized lipoate protein ligases require an additional accessory domain () to adenylate the acyl substrate. Biotin protein ligases have an additional C-terminal domain which participates in biotin adenylation and dimerization. Biotin protein ligases may also have an additional N-terminal domain required for DNA binding, although this domain is not always present.

Engelmann‚Äîthat asserts that a group's prominence increases as it approaches one-third of the population and diminishes when it exceeds or falls below one- third of the population. As the one-third hypothesis was stated originally by Hugo O. Engelmann in a letter to the American Sociologist in 1967: > \\"...we would expect that the most persistent subgroups in any group would be > those which approximate one-third or, by similar reasoning, a multiple of > [i.e., a power of] one-third of the total group. Being the most persistent, > these groups also should be the ones most significantly implicated in > ongoing sociocultural transformation. This does not mean that these groups > need to be dominant, but they play prominent roles.\\" Hugo O. Engelmann. > (1967). \\"Communication to the Editor.\\" American Sociologist, November. p. > 21. The OTH involves two mathematical curves. One represents the likelihood that a subgroup of a specific size will emerge; the other is the probability that it will persist. The product of the two curves is the one-third hypothesis.  Statistical formalization  Statistically speaking, the group that is one- third of the population is the one most likely to persist and the group that is two-thirds the one most likely to dissolve into splinter groups, as if reacting to the cohesiveness of the group that is one-third. According to the binomial coefficient a group of size r occurs in a population of size n in \\\\tbinom nr ways. Because each group of size r can dissolve in 2 r subgroups, the total number of ways all groups of size r can emerge and dissolve equals 3 n, in keeping with the summation: (1+x)^n = \\\\sum_{r=0}^\\\\infty {n \\\\choose r} x^r. \\\\qquad Said otherwise, large groups close to two-thirds of the population will be more likely than any other groups to dissolve into splinter groups. A corollary of this consideration is that much smaller groups will be the ones most likely to emerge and to persist. If groups of size r occur with a probability of \\\\tbinom n r p^r q^{n-r} \\\\\\\\! and dissolve into subgroups with a probability of q^{r} \\\\\\\\!, then the equation reduces to \\\\tbinom n r p^r q^n \\\\\\\\! and given that p and q are each equal to 1/2, Engelmann's One-Third Hypothesis can be readily deduced. It takes the form of \\\\tbinom n r / 2^{n+r} \\\\\\\\!, where n is the number of people and r is the size of a group and can be verified for large numbers by using the Stirling's approximation formula. Early research and recent prediction A perfect example of the OTH was illustrated by Wayne Youngquist‚Äôs 1968 ‚ÄúWooden Shoes and the One-Third Hypothesis,‚Äù which documented the German population in Milwaukee little more than a century ago. As Germans approached one-third of city‚Äôs population they became more and more prominent. As they exceeded that level their importance began to abate.Wayne A. Youngquist. (1968). ‚ÄúWooden Shoes and the One-Third Hypothesis.‚Äù Wisconsin Sociologist, vol. 6; Spring-Summer # 1 & 2 The first empirical test of Engelmann‚Äôs OTH came in the form of the 1967 Detroit riot. It did not explain the cause of the riots but was aimed at explaining their timing. Sam Butler, in 2011, explicitly cited Engelmann and the One-Third Hypothesis in his analysis of London's riots and their aetiology.Butler, Sam (2011). ‚ÄúLondon riots, cruel but not so unusual.‚Äù http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sam-butler/just-a-little-bit-of- hist_b_922751.html Criticism The OTH was never without its critics. Early on K. S. Srikantan correctly questioned the assumption that p and q are each equal to ¬Ω.Srikantan, K. S. (1968). \\"A Curious Mathematical Property.\\" American Sociologist, May. p.p. 154-155. Even if they are not, however, so long as p + q = 1, the maximum value of r will occur at pn/(1+p). The group most likely to emerge and persist will always be smaller than half of the population. In social dynamics the OTH is sometimes referred to as critical mass . The terminology, though appropriate, has become ambiguous because ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù is used in a variety of ways that do not suggest the OTH at all.

Formed on 24 May 1909 as Dundee Hibernian, the club first joined the Scottish Football League (SFL) in 1910. After changing their name to Dundee United in 1923, the club were promoted to the top division of Scottish football for the first time in 1925, but spent most of their first fifty years in the second tier. The club came to greater prominence under two long-serving managers, Jerry Kerr (1959‚Äì1971) and Jim McLean (1971‚Äì1993). Kerr established United in the top flight and led them into European competition for the first time. During the McLean era United won their first major trophies, lifting the Scottish League Cup in 1979 and 1980 and the Scottish Premier Division title in 1983. They were also successful in European competitions, reaching the European Cup semi- finals in 1984 and the UEFA Cup final in 1987. While that level of success has not been maintained since McLean's retirement, the club has continued to challenge for honours in Scottish football, winning the Scottish Cup in 1994 and 2010. History Beginning (1909‚Äì1971) Inspired by the example of Hibernian in Edinburgh the Irish community in Dundee formed a new football club in 1909, following the demise of Dundee Harp. Originally called Dundee Hibernian, the club took over Clepington Park (renamed Tannadice Park) from Dundee Wanderers and played its inaugural game on 18 August, 1909 against Hibernian, a match which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. The following year, the club was voted into the Scottish Football League. The club was saved from going out of business in October 1923 by a group of Dundee businessmen who then decided to change the club's name to Dundee United to appeal to a wider audience than the Irish Catholic community; the name Dundee City was considered but was objected to by long standing city rivals Dundee F.C.. Chart of historic performance of Dundee United in the League.United won promotion to the First Division for the first time in 1924‚Äì25 when they won the Second Division title, although they were relegated back down within two seasons. During WWII, the club was held supported by the club secretary Arthur Cram. Despite another title win (and immediate relegation), for many years, the club languished in the lower reaches of the Scottish league, competing in the top division for only four seasons, until the appointment of Jerry Kerr as manager in 1959. Kerr ended the club's 28-year absence from the First Division in his first season in charge, winning promotion by finishing second in the Second Division. Some notable players from this period include forwards Dennis Gillespie and Jim Irvine, and defenders Doug Smith and Ron Yeats (who went on to captain Liverpool in the 1960s). In the following season, United finished in the top half of the league (one place above city rivals Dundee), where the club stayed with few exceptions for the next 35 years. A strengthened playing squad during the 1960s, which included imports from Scandinavia such as √ñrjan Persson, Finn Seemann, Lennart Wing, Finn D√∏ssing and Mogens Berg, gave United their first taste of European football. On 25 August 1966 Dundee United eliminated Barcelona, then holders of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now known as the UEFA Europa League), beating them 2‚Äì1 in Spain, the first Scottish club to win in that country. Jim McLean era (1971‚Äì1993) Jim McLean, who was a coach at city rivals Dundee F.C. at the time, took over from Jerry Kerr in 1971 and the most successful era in the club's history began. Until then, United was the smaller and less successful of the two Dundee-based football clubs, but McLean (and for a time, with assistant manager Walter Smith) took United to their first ever Scottish Cup final in 1973‚Äì74. They achieved a record high of third place in the Scottish Premier Division in 1977‚Äì78 then again in 1978‚Äì79, before guiding the side to several major honours; the first by winning the Scottish League Cup in 1979‚Äì80, retaining the trophy in the following season. McLean's use of youth was seen as key in the club's success for the next two decades. Dundee United won the Scottish Premier Division title for the first time in the club's history in the 1982‚Äì83 season, with what was then a record number of points and record number of goals scored. By then, United had already established a reputation in Europe with wins over sides like AS Monaco, Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, PSV Eindhoven, Anderlecht and Werder Bremen. In the resulting European Cup, United reached the semi-final stage in their first run, only to be narrowly eliminated by AS Roma. After winning the first leg 2‚Äì0, United lost 3‚Äì0 away, although the Italian side was later fined for attempting to bribe the referee. In 1986, a year's suspension was imposed by UEFA on the Italians alongside a four-year ban for president Dino Viola, due to the bribery attempt. The pinnacle of Dundee United's achievements in Europe came later in 1986‚Äì87, when United became the first Scottish club to reach the final of the UEFA Cup. Along the way, United repeated their 1966 feat of eliminating Barcelona, this time managed by Terry Venables and featuring British players Gary Lineker, Mark Hughes, and Steve Archibald. United defeated Barcelona home and away; they remain the only British side to date to achieve this in any European competition, with a record of four wins from four games. Although they failed to beat IFK Gothenburg in the two-legged final, there was glory in defeat as FIFA awarded a first-ever Fair Play Award to the club for the sporting behaviour of the fans on a memorable night at Tannadice Park. During those years, Dundee United and Aberdeen broke the traditional dominance of the Old Firm in Scottish football, and the two clubs became known in the press as the New Firm, or sometimes, with the inclusion of Hearts, the Small Firm. As Dundee F.C. were not always in the top flight at that time, the New Firm derby superseded the Dundee derby. Dundee United had come a long way under McLean, progressing from comparative obscurity to become one of Scotland's foremost clubs. In June 1993, after nearly 22 years at the helm, McLean relinquished his position as manager, remaining as club chairman, having combined both roles since 1989. After McLean (1993 onwards) SPL season-by-season summary Filling McLean's shoes was the first non-British and non-Irish manager of a Scottish club - Ivan Golac. He inherited a healthy legacy with some of Scotland's finest young talent, though his first action was to sell Duncan Ferguson to Rangers for a fee of ¬£4 million, breaking the record transfer fee involving two British clubs. According to one source, In Golac's first season, he brought the Scottish Cup to Tannadice Park for the first time in 1994 after six previous failures, thus completing the full set of domestic honours for the club. United beat Rangers 1‚Äì0 with Craig Brewster scoring the winner from close range. However, the club's fortunes took a turn for the worse after this, as despite enjoying a relatively average campaign in season 1994‚Äì95, a late run of defeats, culminating in a 1‚Äì0 defeat at home to Celtic on the last day, saw them relegated to the First Division. Despite being title favourites at the lower level, they eventually finished second, which left them facing a two leg play-off against Partick Thistle for the right to play in the Premier Division in the 1996‚Äì97 season. Dundee United won 3‚Äì2 on aggregate, with Owen Coyle scoring the extra-time winner. Returning to the top flight, a third-place finish was achieved under the management of Jim McLean's younger brother, Tommy McLean, but their subsequent form did not match up to this achievement, and Tommy left the club 18 months later. Under the management of Paul Sturrock, Alex Smith and then Paul Hegarty, the club regularly fought against relegation from the Scottish Premier League. Eddie Thompson purchased the club in 2002 and installed Ian McCall as manager, leading to their first top-half finish for seven years in 2004, but their form slumped again the following year, leading to McCall's dismissal and two more fruitless reigns under Gordon Chisholm and former club hero Craig Brewster. In 1997‚Äì98, United reached the League Cup final, but lost 3‚Äì0 to Celtic. United reached their first Scottish Cup final for eleven years in 2004‚Äì05, only to be beaten by Celtic again, 1‚Äì0. Since the SPL's conception in 1998, United have finished in the top half on only two occasions (2003‚Äì04, and 2007‚Äì08). They finished 9th for three consecutive seasons, between 2005 and 2007. However the purchase of the club by long-time supporter Eddie Thompson in 2002 brought a period of sustained investment in playing staff and managers. the 2007‚Äì08 season saw United narrowly lose the League Cup final on penalties, under manager Craig Levein and miss out on a UEFA Cup place in the last two matches of the season. In October 2008, Thompson died from prostate cancer, six years after a protracted battle to gain control of the club from former manager Jim McLean. Peter Houston lifting the tangerine & black-draped Scottish Cup in 2010 following their 3‚Äì0 victory over Ross County. Craig Levein became manager in 2006 and began restructuring the club and overhauling its youth system. The club comfortably avoided relegation in Levein's first season in charge, and then managed two successive fifth-place finishes, the first time they had managed successive top-half finishes since the days of Jim McLean. By late 2009 the club were in second place in the table, and looking to have an outside chance of mounting a title challenge. Levein's achievements had not gone unnoticed however, and in November 2009 he accepted the job of the Scotland national team manager. the club replaced Levien with his assistant, Peter Houston, and the season ended in a third-place finish, and their second Scottish Cup victory. The following season saw a fourth-place finish and the season after was similar to the season before with a poor start, but good form from rising stars such as Gary Mackay-Steven and Johnny Russell, helped United reach another top six finish for the fifth consecutive season. The club qualified for the UEFA Europa League for three successive seasons, however they went out at the first hurdle in each campaign to AEK Athens, ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw & Dynamo Moscow respectively. It was announced on 17 January 2013, that manager Peter Houston was to leave Dundee United at the end of his contract in May 2013. However, on 28 January it was announced Houston had left the club by mutual consent. He was replaced two days later by Jackie McNamara. McNamara's first game in charge of Dundee United was a Scottish Cup tie against Rangers. United won the game 3‚Äì0 and McNamara began to turn the club's fortunes around, securing a top six place over New Firm rivals Aberdeen in late, dramatic fashion. In his first full season, McNamara took United to fourth in the Premiership and the 2014 Scottish Cup Final, losing 2‚Äì0 to St Johnstone at Parkhead. The following season, United got off to a strong start to their league campaign, winning six of their opening eight fixtures which included comprehensive away victories at rivals Aberdeen and Dundee. United were even tipped as dark horses at one stage for the league title, however a disappointing run of results particularly after February following the sale of two key players ‚Äì Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven ‚Äì to Celtic midway through the season led to a collapse in United's league form and they eventually finished a distant fifth place. United's remaining chances of success were culled in the space of a week during March, in which they were defeated by Celtic in the 2015 Scottish League Cup Final at Hampden Park, before being convincingly knocked out of the 2014‚Äì15 Scottish Cup at the quarter-final stage by the same opposition following a replay. McNamara was sacked and replaced with Mixu Paatelainen in October 2015, but the team's form failed to improve, and United were relegated to the Championship after a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Dundee on 2 May 2016. They were unsuccessful in attempting to return to the top division at the first time of asking; a third-place finish in the 2016‚Äì17 Scottish Championship resulted in play-off matches, with ties against Morton and Falkirk ending in victory but the final round against Hamilton (who had not had any other play-off fixtures to play) being lost. In 2017‚Äì18, United placed third again and beat Dunfermline in the first round of the play-offs, but lost in the next to Livingston. References Dundee United F.C.

Education Durbin was educated at The Hall School Hampstead and Highgate School in London. After competing in the 1978/9 International Mathematical Olympiad, he went on to study at the University of Cambridge graduating in 1982 with a first class honours degree on the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos. After graduating, he continued to study for a PhD at St John's College, Cambridge studying the development and organisation of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans whilst working at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, supervised by John Graham White. Research Durbin's early work included developing the primary instrument software for one of the first X-ray crystallography area detectors and the MRC Biorad confocal microscope, alongside contributions to neural modelling. He then led the informatics for the Caenorhabditis elegans genome project, and alongside Jean Thierry-Mieg developed the genome database AceDB, which evolved into the WormBase web resource. Following this he played an important role in data collection for and interpretation of the human genome sequence. He has developed numerous methods for computational sequence analysis. These include gene finding (e.g. GeneWise) with Ewan Birney and Hidden Markov models for protein and nucleic acid alignment and matching (e.g. HMMER) with Sean Eddy and Graeme Mitchison. A standard textbook Biological Sequence analysis coauthored with Sean Eddy, Anders Krogh and Graeme Mitchison describes some of this work. Using these methods Durbin worked with colleagues to build a series of important genomic data resources, including the protein family database Pfam, the genome database Ensembl, and the gene family database TreeFam. More recently Durbin has returned to sequencing and has developed low coverage approaches to population genome sequencing, applied first to yeast, and has been one of the leaders in the application of new sequencing technology to study human genome variation. Durbin currently co- leads the international 1000 Genomes Project to characterise variation down to 1% allele frequency as a foundation for human genetics. Awards and honours Durbin was a joint winner of the Mullard Award of the Royal Society in 1994 (for work on the confocal microscope), won the Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran Award of the Foundation for Science and Technology in 2004, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2004 and a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2009.

History (founding) The Mercury Theatre was opened in 1933 by Ashley Dukes for the production of new drama and to serve as a centre for the Ballet Rambert, run by his wife Marie Rambert. The building, at 2, Ladbroke Road, London W11, had been built in 1851, but was extensively altered to serve as a theatre.British History Online It was a well-equipped but small venue, seating about 150. Productions The style was set by the first production, Jupiter Translated, an adaptation of Moli√®re's Amphitryon by Walter James Turner with a ballet by Rupert Doone as entr'acte. The theatre's reputation was established in 1935 by the first London productions of T. S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral, transferred from Canterbury, and two years later by W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood's collaborative poetic play The Ascent of F6. 1943 saw the production of Eugene O'Neill's Days Without End. The Pilgrim Players' seasons in 1945‚Äì1947, under the direction of E. Martin Browne, consolidated the position of poetic drama at the Mercury with such productions as Norman Nicholson's The Old Man of the Mountains, Ronald Duncan's This Way to the Tomb and Anne Ridler's The Shadow Factory. These were followed by comedies in verse: Christopher Fry's A Phoenix Too Frequent and Donagh MacDonagh's Happy as Larry. In 1947 William Saroyan's The Beautiful People and O'Neill's SS Glencairn both had their London premi√®res there, as did Jean Genet's The Maids.

This practice has been in effect since the early years of corsetry, often deplored by moralists and the subject of urban legends and cautionary tales in many centuries. For the same amount of time, doctors spoke against the practice, citing dramatic risks to the wearer's health. However, many claims were based on the incomplete medical knowledge of the day, as well as incorrect assumptions and beliefs about the female body. Heart There is no actual evidence from specific, cited autopsies supporting the notion that the heart is damaged by corsetry. A study published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research in 1989 showed that participants who wore waist belts when weight lifting had an increase in blood pressure, and that when weight lifting, the support belts that the men wore increased their blood pressure. This inspired the popular corset maker and founder of Lucy's Corsetry, Lucy Williams, to see if this could potentially apply to corsets as well. In a video, she measures her blood pressure both in and out of the corset, seeing a 10% increase of blood pressure while wearing a corset. This is consistent with the 1989 study which saw a 6-15% increase in blood pressure of the wearers. Lungs The constriction of the corset, if too tight, prevents the lower lobes of the lungs from fully expanding when taking a breath. This puts extra strain on and causes additional work for the lower lobes of the lungs. David Kunzle, an art historian, argues that because the lower lobes have been strained, they are unable to adequately fight off pneumoniaKunzle, David. Fashion and Fetishism. Totowa: Rowman and Littlefield, 1982. Print. or bacillus tuberculosis which go to the lower lobes of the lungs first.Crutchfield, Eugene Lee, M.D. \\"Some Ill Effects of the Corset\\". Gaillard's Medical Journal 67 (July 1897): 37‚Äì14. Google Books. However, Valerie Steele notes that the corset's association with tuberculosis originated before the bacillus was discovered, and that the corset may have only aggravated the condition. Circulation In the nineteenth century, corseting was thought to lead to cardiac palpitations in the heart and spanaemia, or the lack of oxygen in the blood.\\"Spanaemia.\\" Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary. n.d. Web This claim was successfully debunked, as there is no evidence to support corset-caused circulatory damage. Breasts Corset-wearing cannot cause breast cancer. Occurring more frequently is a reduction of the size of the nipples. Victorians believed the corset caused mammary abscesses, a common inflammation of the connective tissue in the breast; however, mastitis is caused by bacteria, and thus there is no evidence supporting that clothing of any type alone could have led to the condition. These effects are only consistent with that of over-bust corsets and not relevant to those using under-bust only. Stomach Victorian doctors believed that, in a tightly laced corset, the stomach would be unable to churn correctly, making it difficult to digest food completely. This condition is called dyspepsia, more commonly known as indigestion. It may cause constipation and make it difficult for the wearer to eat a sizable meal. Liver Victorian doctors believed that the liver experienced many complications while the body is tightlaced, becoming severed due to the location of the ribs as a result of the tightlacing, and that the liver would become enlarged or displaced.\\"Health Matters.\\" Science. Vol. 10. Washington, D.C.: American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1887. 281‚Äì282. 253. JSTOR. Web. 26 Sept. 2009. Another possibility was mechanical congestion, the result of the pressure placed on the inferior vena cava, thus obstructing the flow of blood. According to Dr. Tse-Ling Fong, liver cancer is often the result of this vein being blocked. The blocked vein is not able to filter out the bad blood in the liver resulting in a cancerous infection.Fong, Tse-Ling, M.D. \\"Liver Cancer.\\" MedicineNet.com. Ed. Leslie J. Schoenfield, M.D. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 October 2009. However, corsets would not have had a drastic effect on the liver, merely squeezing and elongating it, and modern research shows that much of the liver function can be lost without causing health problems. Steele also notes that there is a great deal of variation in liver appearance, which may have confused anatomists performing autopsies. Colon The corset may have aided a poor diet in causing constipation which, according to Dr. Majid Ali, if severe enough and left untreated, can eventually lead to death.Ali, Majid, M.D. \\"Control of Constipation\\". Ethnics in Medicine. n.d. Web. 14 October 2009. Uterus The uterus was believed by Victorian doctors to suffer the most from tightlacing, failing to develop properly due to the inactivity of the abdominal muscles or becoming prolapsed. Others believed that every time the bladder or rectum emptied, the uterus was unable to be lifted back into place due to weak ligaments, causing head and back pain, and inability to stand or walk, and improper menstruation.Law, Hartland, M.D., and Herbert E. Law, F.C.S. \\"Displacements of the Womb\\". Viavi Hygiene: Explaining the Natural Principles upon Which the Viavi System of Treatment for Men, Women and Children Is Based. San Francisco: Viavi Company, 1912. 258‚Äì271. Google Books. However, this line of thought rested on very little evidence and the assumption that the uterus was one of the most important organs in a woman's body, and it is unlikely that the uterus actually suffered from corsetry. Gall bladder Victorian doctors believed there was a relationship between gallstones and tightlacing, the corset causing extreme weight loss. (Gallstones are the result of the body metabolizing fat to compensate for rapid weight loss.Cornforth, Tracee. \\"What Causes Gallstones\\". About.com. Ed. Medical Review Board. N.p., 18 July 2009) However, the most common sufferers from gallstones are female even today, and it is unlikely that the corset had much to do with the condition. Muscles Wearing a corset for a very extended period of time can result in muscle atrophy and lower-back pain. The pectoral muscles also become weak after extensive tightlacing. These weakened muscles cause a greater reliance on the corset.

Designed by Albert Speer as Adolf Hitler's main military command complex, it was reassigned by Hitler in February 1940 to Luftwaffe chief Hermann G√∂ring as his headquarters for the Battle of Britain, serving as Hitler's only during the December 1944- January 1945 Ardennes Offensive. Background Map showing the location of Adlerhorst, and other F√ºhrer Headquarters throughout Europe There were no official F√ºhrer Headquarters before World War II because Hitler used either existing military complexes, or mobile facilities close to the battle lines. Under plans developed by Martin Bormann and architectural designs by Speer, a series of F√ºhrer complexes were built. The best known were: the F√ºhrerbunker in Berlin; the Berghof complex in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria; and the Wolfsschanze near Kƒôtrzyn in modern-day Poland. Austrian noble Emma von Scheitlein acquired Kransberg Castle in the village of Kransberg in 1926, and used it for society events. Chosen due to its central location as the proposed main military command headquarters of Hitler, it was appropriated by the Nazi government in 1939. Speer immediately began adapting it, designing military-grade infrastructure which was well disguised and adapted to fit-in with its surroundings. Construction The main complex was a collection of seven cottages, in a heavily wooded compound beyond the castle's main entrance. Although each building was designed as an air raid bunker with thick concrete walls, each had the appearance of a traditional locally built Fachwerk (half-timbered) style wooden cottage, complete with second storey dormer windows and flower baskets under a sloped tiled roof. Internally, each was furnished in traditional German style with oak floors, pine wall panelling, utilitarian leather upholstered furniture, and decorated with fringed shade wall lamps, wall hangings depicting hunting scenes or Teutonic battles, and a set of deer antlers. The cottages were numbered and allocated as follows: Kransberg Castle, behind which the Adlerhorst compound was built, and underneath which the bunker complex was constructed *Haus 1: The F√ºhrer's house. In keeping with Hitler's preferences, it was no more luxuriously appointed than the other six. *Haus 2: Also referred to as the \\"casino.\\" This was German military terminology for an officers' club. In addition to a lounge and caf√© at ground level, and bedrooms on the second floor, the building contained an entrance to the bunker below it, giving immediate access to a secure situation room and coded communications center. *Haus 3: The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht-house (OKW). This was designed as the residence of the commanding general, and during its use housed Rundstedt, Jodl, Kesselring, G√∂ring and Keitel. *Haus 4: Known as the \\"generals' house.\\" This was occupied by the second echelon of the general staff, including Manteuffel, Sch√∂rner and Guderian. *Haus 5: The so-called Pressehaus. This was occupied by an arm of Goebbels' propaganda ministry. *Haus 6: The Reichsleiters' residence. This offered accommodation for top- level political leaders, such as Martin Bormann, Alfred Rosenberg and Robert Ley, who came to consult and advise the F√ºhrer. *Haus 7: The Wachhaus. The largest building on the site, designed to house the F√ºhrer's offices and his personal security, secretarial and housekeeping staffs. Built on top of a bunker base, the building was connected to the castle by a long bunker. With one wall exposed, the bunker was camouflaged as a stone retaining wall. To add authenticity, grape vines were planted and grew onto the stone wall. Located in the village itself was the largest building of all, the fortified Kraftfahrzeughalle or motor pool garage. Even though its purpose was purely military, in addition to being a garage for a large fleet of armoured limousines, fire engines, busses and ambulances, it also had a Fachwerk-style housing for the families of the personnel assigned to them. Above the castle and compound, located to the north in the hills, was a disguised Wehrmacht depot. To build the complex quickly and without the knowledge of local residents, construction workers from Organisation Todt were brought in from other regions. The entire area was ringed with camouflaged anti-aircraft batteries, constructed first to deflect suspicion about the importance of the site. The locals were told that it was an expansion of the air defence zone of Bad M√ºnstereifel. No evidence existed in post-war records to support that the construction phase was anything but successful in covering up the complex's purpose. No notes or briefings were uncovered to suggest that its purpose was known beyond Hitler's inner-circle of its construction or importance. Remains of an alternate guard house to the Adlerhorst complex. Note the sloping roof and scale of the building, and the half demolished stone wall to the left end wall. This entrance complex was originally disguised to look like a Fachwerk (half-timbered) style wooden cottage Operations During construction of Adlerhorst, Hitler had used the castle to plan some of the early western campaigns, including the Battle of France and the drive to Dunkirk. After the completion of construction, quick approval was given for operation. However, after a visit by Hitler in February 1940, he dismissed it as an operational base, as he considered it too lavish for his Spartan taste (and image as a man of the people). Thus, Speer was asked to adapt the complex to meet the needs for use by the Luftwaffe, and specifically to serve as the Luftwaffe headquarters for Hermann G√∂ring during Operation Sea Lion, and the invasion of Great Britain. Hitler's Directive No. 16 (the order initiating Sealion) nominated the 'Adlerhorst' (Eagles Nest) at Ziegenberg as the Sealion headquarters. The directive ordered the headquarters for each of the services to set up nearby. The Army and the Navy were to occupy mutual premises in the Army Headquarters at Giessen while the Luftwaffe was to move its headquarters train to Ziegenberg. Ziegenberg is north of Frankfurt and 32 km from Giessen, but it was usual at that time for the German armed service headquarters to be separated by distances up to 50 km during a major operation. For example, Goering's HQ was located 50 km from Felsennest, Hitler's HQ for the invasion of France (10 May-6 June 1940)Seidler & Zeigert (2004), p.63. This distance did not prevent that operation from being successful. Although Hitler didn't move to the purpose built F√ºhrerhauptquartier, he may have done so had the plan been put into execution. His 1,100 man bodyguard, the Fuhrer- Begleitbataillon, plus a 600-man Luftwaffe anti-aircraft detachment, moved to Adlerhorst 5 July 1940 in anticipation of Hitler's arrival. They didn't leave until November 25, 1940.F W Siegler & D. Ziegert, Hitler's Secret Headquarters, Greenhill Books, London, 2004, p. 75 When plans for the invasion of Britain were abandoned in favour of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, the castle and complex were put to use as a rehabilitation center for soldiers of all ranks, and allocated as G√∂ring's personal retreat.Ein dunkles Kapitel in der Geschichte des Schlosses (A Dark Chapter In The Castle's History). Usinger Anzeiger September 12, 2001 Ardennes Offensive After the 20 July plot attempt on Hitler's life and the abandonment of the Wolfsschanze due to the advances of the Red Army, Hitler needed a new military base of operations for the forthcoming Ardennes Offensive. Adlerhorst had been given additional security since 1943. To blend in with the pine-forested hilltop and to defy air detection, most of the cottages were further disguised with fake evergreen trees. From October 1944, Adlerhorst had also become the headquarters of the Commander in Chief of OB West, Gerd von Rundstedt. Hitler arrived at Giessen station on his personal F√ºhrersonderzug (train) on 11 December 1944, taking up residence in Haus 1 until 16 January 1945. Rundstedt who was to command Operation Wacht am Rhein set up his headquarters near Limburg, Belgium, close enough for the generals and Panzer Corps commanders who were planning the attack, to travel to Adlerhorst in an SS-operated bus convoy that evening. With the castle used to provide for overflow accommodation, the main party settled into Haus 2/the casino. Those present included generals Jodl, Keitel, Blumentritt, Manteuffel and S.S. colonel general Sepp Dietrich. Joined by Hitler, Rundstedt ran through the plans at 05:00 on December 15; the plan that envisaged the attack of three German armies consisting of over 250,000 men. Believing in omens and the successes of his early war campaigns that had been planned at Adlerhorst, Hitler rejoiced in the battles' early successes, taking long walks in the pine forest, regaling his team with his postwar plans and aspirations. Shortly after Christmas, G√∂ring arrived and took up residence in the castle. After an extremely downbeat briefing in the casino, G√∂ring privately suggested to Hitler that a truce be sought via his Swedish contacts. Hitler flew into a rage, and after threatening to have G√∂ring put before a firing squad, mentally dismissed him as deputy Fuehrer. Operation Nordwind After giving his 1945 New Year's speech from the Pressehaus, Hitler returned to Haus 1 to welcome in the New Year with his close friends and secretarial support team. At 04:00 he walked to the casino to watch the development of Operation Nordwind, his counter-offensive on New Year's Day. At midnight, nine Panzer divisions of Heeresgruppe G commanded by Generaloberst Johannes Blaskowitz had mounted an all-out attack on Bastogne. Then a faked diversionary attack was mounted by eight German divisions of Army Group Upper Rhine (Heeresgruppe Oberrhein) commanded by Heinrich Himmler, against the U.S. 7th Army and French 1st Army position, which was the thinly stretched line of 110 kilometres (68 mi) long, near Lembach in the Upper Vosges mountains in Alsace; to the southeast. This defence line had been weakened by U.S. general Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had ordered troops, equipment and supplies north to reinforce the American armies involved in the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes. If successful, the German operation would have opened the way for Operation Zahnarzt, a planned major thrust into the rear of the U.S. 3rd Army. However, having cracked the Enigma code machines, each German manoeuvre was either prepared for, or out-flanked by an allied counter-move. This resulted in a bitter attritional campaign that was lost from the 25th January onwards, with the Germans running out of replacement man power, machinery and supplies. Abandonment and attempted demolition On 6 January 1945, a blockbuster bomb was jettisoned on Ziegenberg by a returning Allied bomber, damaging the church and several houses, killing four residents. With the Ardennes Offensive failed, and no new military plans or the resources with which to carry them out, the German military high command accepted that the western front was lost. Hitler left Adlerhorst on January 16, 1945, for Berlin. Having been made commander of OB West on March 11, on March 17, Kesselring ordered all classified documents and sensitive equipment removed from the castle, moving himself and the command centre to the OKW house. On March 19, the Allies, once alerted of the original purpose of the complex, and not knowing if Hitler was still in residence, subjected the castle and surrounding area to a 45-minute fire bombing air raid by a squadron of P-51 Mustangs. This resulted in the loss of 10 civilian lives, and the castle and many of the surrounding buildings were damaged, destroyed or set on fire. On March 28, with the American army only away, using all available motor pool equipment, Kesselring ordered all civilian employees and families of military personnel to evacuate. German troops were instructed to dynamite the Fuehrer's compound. Adlerhorst and Ziegenberg (1956) Capture by Allied forces The castle and village were captured by units of the U.S. Army on March 30, 1945. They found the compound as a burned-out jumbled mass of concrete bunkers bearing no resemblance to the original \\"wooden country house\\" design. But for some reason both the Wachhaus and the Pressehaus escaped demolition, both well preserved and with access to the remaining Adlerhorst bunker complex. Soon afterwards a British-American detention center or Operation Dustbin, was moved from Paris and re-established in parts of the complex for high-ranking German non-military prisoners of war. It focused on key industrialists, scientists and economists; among those interrogated here were Hjalmar Schacht, Wernher von Braun, Ferdinand Porsche, and the leaders of the IG Farben chemical conglomerate. The highest-ranking of these persons of interest was the complex's original designer Albert Speer. Others interrogated here included Hjalmar Schachtp=95 books.google.ca and many technical, financial and industrial leaders.p=233 books.google.ca Present Most of the castle lay in ruins after the war, but in 1956 the Organisation Gehlen, the U.S.-German intelligence unit that later became the nucleus of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, moved in. It was later followed by V Corps (United States) which operated an NCO academy, and by U.S. intelligence units which directed large parts of its espionage network in communist East Germany from the castle. After a failed restoration attempt in the 1960s, in 1987 with US Army assistance the castle structure was rebuilt, with the stone walls clad in stucco. Returned to the reunified German government in 1990, it was subsequently sold to members of the family of the pre-war owner, and converted into luxury apartments from 1991. The Wachhaus and the Pressehaus are both preserved, with the Pressehaus an almost exact replica of the F√ºhrerhaus. The Kraftfahrzeughalle motor pool building was not demolished. It was occupied for two years post war by a battalion of U.S. Army Combat Engineers. Converted into a US military hospital in 1977, it was returned to the West German Government in the same year. The half-timbered main hall still stands, and is presently occupied by offices and small businesses. The foundations of several of the compounds houses have been recycled for modern home and business construction, with the foundation of the OKW house now the basement for a hotel and bar named the Gasthaus Adlerhorst.

The first one led Scythians, under whom, according to Strabo, they overran Asia, and advanced as far as Egypt. This was perhaps the incursion mentioned by Herodotus, who tells us that they held Asia for 28 years, and were ultimately driven out by Cyaxares, 607 BC. According to Herodotus, however, the king, who led the expedition of which he gives an account, was Madyas; and Madyas is mentioned by Strabo (i. p. 61) as king of the Cimmerians. An incursion of the Scythians to the borders of Egypt in very early times is recorded by Justin, but in an obscure and unsatisfactory way. 2\\\\. Another king of the Scythians, probably a descendant of the above. He was a son of Saulius, the brother and slayer of Anacharsis. When Darius I of Persia invaded Scythia, about 513 BC, and the Scythians retreated before him, he sent a message to Idanthyrsus, calling upon him either to fight or submit. The Scythian king answered that, in fleeing before the Persians, he was not urged by fear, but was merely living the wandering/nomadic life to which he was accustomed, that there was no reason why he should fight the Persians, as he had neither cities for them to take nor lands. He, however did reply, \\"But if all you want is to come to fight, we have the graves of our fathers.

It is found widespread in western North America, west of south- central Alberta, Wyoming, and Nebraska. Along the Pacific Coast it occurs from northern Mexico to south-central British Columbia. It can be found from sea level to altitudes over 2000 meters in a variety of habitats from dense forest to shrub desert. The wingspan is 29.5‚Äì35 mm. It is the most variable species in the genus Aseptis with respect to forewing color and pattern strength. It may be brownish, warm dark brown, pale to medium grey brown, yellowish light brown, or reddish brown depending on locality. The most noticeable marking in dark specimens is the large pale yellowish postreniform patch, which is bisected by the dark postmedial line. The antemedial line is strongly convex laterally and is filled with light tan. Black forewing markings include a series of wedges near the outer margin below the apex, the outlines of the three forewing spots, and in most specimens a short black basal dash. Pale specimens can be washed out or have contrasting dark markings. In the south the flight begins in March at low elevations and in April to July in the mountains. In the north the flight begins later and lasts into August. The larvae feed on various broadleaf trees and shrubs, including big-leaf maple, ocean spray, and Ceanothus species. Other recorded food plants include Oemleria, Symphoricarpos and Ribes species. The larva is green with a white and red lateral stripe.Revision of the genus Aseptis McDunnough (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae, Noctuinae, Xylenini) with a description of two new genera, Paraseptis and Viridiseptis References External links *Caterpillars of Pacific Northwest Forests and Woodlands *Bug Guide *Images Aseptis Moths of Canada Moths described in 1865 ","title":"Aseptis binotata"},{"id":"25121973","text":"Shariki (Russian: –®–∞ÃÅ—Ä–∏–∫–∏, \\"The Balls\\") is a puzzle video game written in 1988 by Russian developer Eugene Alemzhin and later developed for MS-DOS in 1994.

In the summer 1864, during the early days of the Dungan Rebellion in Xinjiang, Musa joined the army of the rebel Khoja BurhƒÅn al-Dƒ´n when it passed through Sayram.

After the people of Uqturpan overthrew the Khojas in 1867, Musa Sayrami escorted the arrested Khojas to the headquarters of the new ruler of the region, Yaqub Beg. He then found a place for himself in Yaqub Beg's government apparatus, where he served under Mirza Baba Beg, the zakatchi (chief revenue officer) in Aksu. Musa survived the death of Yaqub Beg's and the reconquest of Xinjiang by Zuo Zongtang's Qing armies in 1877. He lived the rest of his days in Aksu, writing and re-writing his Tarikh-i amniyya,Kim (2004), pp. 194-195 which he completed in 1903. TƒÅrƒ´kh-i amniyya and TƒÅrƒ´kh-i ·∏•amƒ´di TƒÅrƒ´kh-i amniyya (\\"History of Peace\\")Kim (2004), pp. 265-266 was written in the Chagatai language--the old literary language of Central Asia, which can be thought of as an ancestral form of today's Uyghur and Uzbek languages. According to modern scholars, the Chagatai of Musa Sayrami's manuscripts had been influenced by \\"modern\\" Uyghur language (i.e., the vernacular of Sayrami's own era). Soviet researchers suggested that the title of Musa's work also alludes to the name of one of his friends, Dadhah Muhammad Amin Bai Aqsaqal; thus, it can also be read as \\"History dedicated to Amin\\". Amin was the elder (aqsaqal) of the Russian subjects in Aksu and Uqturpan, and maintained correspondence with the Russian consul in Kashgar, Nikolai Petrovsky. The Soviet researcher K.A. Usmanov thus suggested that Petrovsky, known as an avid collector of materials related to the history of the region, may have been instrumental in encouraging Musa to undertake his work. TƒÅrƒ´kh-i amniyya, which has survived in several manuscripts, consists of the following parts: * the introduction, which surveys the history of Xinjiang from Noah to Chengiz Khan to the beginning of the Dungan Rebellion * Part 1, which discusses the early stages of the rebellion, under leadership of the Khojas * Part 2, which discusses the Yaqub Beg's regime, and the reconquest of the region by the Chinese troops in 1877. * Conclusion TƒÅrƒ´kh-i amniyya was first published by the Russian scholar N.N. Pantusov in Kazan in 1905.Kim (2004), p. 280 (Pantusov had apparently a special interest in the history of the region; he had earlier published a Russian translation of another work on the same topic, MullƒÅ BilƒÅl's GhazƒÅt dar mulk-i Ch√≠n (\\"Holy War in China\\"), originally written in 1876.) A modern Uyghur translation was published in Urumqi in 1988 as T√§rikhi √§miniy√§. TƒÅrƒ´kh-i ·∏•amƒ´di (History of ·∏§amid) is a revised version of TƒÅrƒ´kh-i amniyya, completed in 1908. A modern Uyghur translation by Enver Baytur was published in Beijing in 1986. Modern assessment In the view of the modern expert on the period's history, Kim Hodong, Sayrami is \\"one of the best historians that Central Asia has ever produced\\", and his books are the most important locally produced source on the Dungan Rebellion and the Yaqub Beg regime.Kim (2004), p. xvi Footnotes References * External links * Sairami, Musa, 1836-1917.

Without opposition, they marched against the village of La Catalina. However, the invaders, 105 kilometres (65 mi) short of their objective, slowed down three days later because of the growing concerns of their commander, Major-General Thomas Wentworth. Santiago's Governor Francisco Caxigal de la Vega, garrison commander Carlos Riva Ag√ºero, and local militia Captain Pedro Guerrero had only 350 regulars and 600 militia to hand and so retreated from the British. Nevertheless, Wentworth's army became paralyzed by fatigue and disease, spending the next four months encamped, being sporadically raided by Spanish guerrillas. Vernon, disgusted at his colleague's inactivity, but unwilling to risk any part of the fleet against the town, sent warships to cruise independently until Wentworth's sick list grew so long‚Äî2,260 soldiers being struck with fever by 5 December‚Äîthat the expedition was re-embarked, setting sail at dawn on 9 December and returning to Port Royal ten days later. Aftermath Admiral Vernon's enterprise accomplished nothing but the loss of many of his soldiers and his own disgrace. Vernon was forced to return to Britain in 1742.Thomas Coke pp 268 References Bibliography * Pares, Richard. War and Trade in the West Indies, Oxford university press, 1936 * Richmond, H.W..

The original canned scouring powder product has been manufactured and sold since 1882. It was invented by a chemist in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it continues to be manufactured by SerVaas Laboratories. The canned product's primary active ingredient is oxalic acid. Bar Keepers Friend has various cleaning uses.  Overview  Bar Keepers Friend was originally manufactured in 1882 as a cleaning agent in powdered form. This formulation is still manufactured today. It was invented by chemist George William Hoffman in Indianapolis, Indiana. The product was originally sold to bars in Indianapolis and Hoffman asserted in a patent application that the name had been used since January, 1887. The formula contains oxalic acid as a primary ingredient. The Bar Keepers Friend logo represents the swinging doors of a saloon. According to the president of SerVaas Laboratories, Paul SerVaas, although some people complained during Prohibition, \\"the name was never changed. It's been Bar Keepers Friend since 1882\\". In the 1950s the product became the base of a line of cleaning products made by Indianapolis-based SerVaas Laboratories, which started producing and carrying products under the Bar Keepers Friend brand name. Additional products manufactured and marketed under the Bar Keepers Friend brand name include liquid, cream and spray cleaners. SerVaas Laboratories had 40 employees in May 2011 and 54 in April 2016. Production Bar Keepers Friend products are mass-produced in a manufacturing environment that has significant automation in the process. The powdered and canned (original) product is formulated in separate two-ton batches during the production process. In September 2016, the canned powdered product was manufactured at a rate of approximately 60,000 cans per day, which are packaged in 12, 15 and 21 ounce cans. Active ingredients According to the 2015 material safety data sheet, the ingredients are feldspar, linear sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (DDBSA) and oxalic acid. Prolonged use and extended skin contact may cause irritation, peeling and contact dermatitis, which is avoided by wearing gloves. The product can also be an eye irritant.

The grouping is disputed as some Georgian linguists consider the two to form a dialect continuum of one Zan language. This is often challenged on the most commonly applied criteria of mutual intelligibility when determining borders between languages, as Mingrelian and Laz are only partially mutually intelligible, though speakers of one language can recognize a sizable amount of vocabulary of the other, primarily due to semantic loans, lexical loans and other areal features resulting from geographical proximity and historical close contact common for dialect continuums. The term Zan comes from the Greco-Roman name of one of the chief Colchian tribes, which is almost identical to the name given to the Mingrelians by the Svans (a northwestern Kartvelian group). Georgian linguist Akaki Shanidze proposed the name \\"Colchian\\" for Zan. History According to a glottochronological analysis by G. Klimov, the Zan languages had split from the Common Kartvelian group by about the 8th century BC. Zan was spoken by a continuous community stretching along the Black Sea coast, from modern day Trabzon, Turkey into western Georgia. In the mid-7th century AD, Zan speakers were split by intrusions of Georgian-speaking peoples from Iberia (eastern Georgia), driven by the Arabs, who took over the regions of Imereti, Guria, and Adjara. Separated by geography, and later by politics and religion, northern and southern Zan eventually diverged into Mingrelian and Laz. Since the differentiation was basically complete by early modern times, it is not customary to speak of a unified Zan language today. Presently, Mingrelian is spoken by the Mingrelians primarily in northwestern Georgia (Mingrelia and Abkhazia), whereas Laz is spoken by the Laz people in Turkey (and in a small portion of Adjara, southwestern Georgia).

Biography  Proctor was born in Armidale, New South Wales, to William Consett Proctor who was a solicitor and a politician and Kathleen Jane Louisa Proctor (n√©e Roberts). When her parents separated in 1892, she and her mother moved to Bowral to stay with her grandmother who encouraged her interest in painting. Proctor studied at the Sydney Art School from 1896 under Julian Ashton, then at the St John's Wood School of Art in London in 1903. Ashton and Lambert became lifelong friends and she modelled for him many times. Apart from two years spent in Sydney between 1912 and 1914 she worked in London 1903 from to 1921, associating with fellow Australian expatriates Charles Conder, Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts. She produced pencil drawings, decorative watercolours and fans influenced by Conder and Japanese woodblock prints. She exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts and the New English Art Club, later producing lithographs which were exhibited at the Senefelder Club and at the London Goupil Gallery for the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. Proctor was also inspired by a performance of the Ballets Russes which she saw in 1911. She found it 'beautiful and inspired'. Her decorative work was inspired by Chelsea Arts Club balls with their elaborate costumes and beautiful fabrics. After returning to Sydney, Proctor exhibited with Margaret Preston in 1925 then with George Lambert and the Contemporary Group who exhibited in Adrian Feint's Grosvenor Gallery in George Street from 1926 to 1928 with Grace Cossington Smith, Marion Hall Best, Elioth Gruner, Margaret Preston, Roland Wakelin and Roy de Maistre. She and Preston were friends who exhibited together in Sydney and Melbourne until a precipitous bout of professional jealousy in 1925. Proctor was known for her interest in fashion, and designed her own clothing, expressing her individuality. On her return from London in the early 1920s, Proctor was unimpressed with the Australian women's fashion of the day, poor availability of the sort of luxury fabrics she had been used to seeing in London and Paris, and particularly the way Australian women wore what she considered shapeless hats. By 1922, she had set up a studio in the Grosvenor Building at 219 George Street where she taught classes. She regarded herself as one of the first 'moderns' to exhibit in Australia, regularly attending art openings, always impeccably dressed in lavender or violet. Proctor taught Adrian Feint the techniques of woodblock-engraving 1926‚Äì28, and they both produced covers for the Ure Smith magazine The Home. Later she taught linocut printing at Julian Ashton's Sydney Art School and drawing at the Society of Arts and Crafts of New South Wales. Late in life she promoted the neglected work of her cousin John Russell. Proctor remained unmarried but was briefly engaged to Sidney Long in 1898, whom she had met and studied with in London. Proctor was always exquisitely groomed and considered beautiful. She was still creating and exhibiting drawings of sure and subtle draughtsmanship until late in life, with her work showing at the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney. Two of several portraits by Lambert of Proctor hang in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the National Portrait Gallery in Australia has a portrait in charcoal, also by Lambert. Recognition *Awarded a prize at the Bowral Amateur Art Society's exhibition in 1894, while attending Lynthorpe Ladies' College. This was judged by Arthur Streeton) *The Society of Artists awarded her a medal in recognition of her influence as a tastemaker in New South Wales. *A retrospective exhibition The World of Thea Proctor was held at the National Portrait Gallery, Old Parliament House in 2005. *Proctor Street in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm is named in her honour.

A small section of the cemetery is located in neighboring Dedham. The cemetery was established by the town of Hyde Park in 1892, and became the responsibility of the city of Boston when it annexed that town in 1912. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 16, 2009. It is the newest of Boston's cemeteries, and has more than 40,000 burials. Description Fairview Cemetery is located on the west side of Hyde Park, bounded on the east by houses lining Turtle Pond Parkway, and the south by Boston's Mill Pond Reservation. The main entrance is near its southeast corner, accessed via Fairview Avenue from the junction of Turtle Pond Parkway and River Street. The core of the cemetery is dominated by a hill which provides views of the surrounding countryside, and is a significant influence on the circulation pattern. Early burials tended to be placed on the higher levels of the hill, and included large family lots with family monuments. The town of Hyde Park was incorporated in 1868, and in 1892 authorized the purchase of the estate of William S. Damrell, a businessman and Congressman. The core of the cemetery (about 50 of its nearly ) was laid out in the then-fashionable rural cemetery style, with winding lanes and a landscaped environment, by G.L. Richardson. It was the Hyde Park's first cemetery, and the last public cemetery established in what is now the city of Boston.

He built an international career as an outstanding Wagnerian singer but damaged his reputation during the 1930s by joining the Nazi Party. Biography Bockelmann, the son of a village schoolmaster, was born at Bodenteich near Celle. He studied philology and music at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig. Soon after his graduation he volunteered as a soldier during World War I, and was wounded several times while fighting for his country. After the war he made his operatic debut in 1920 in Celle, and from 1921 to 1926 he sang as a member of the Oper Leipzig's company. Bockelmann's opera career in Germany would hit its peak during the 1930s and last until the 1950s.Naxos Bio At the height of his vocal powers, in 1932, he was engaged by the Berlin State Opera, remaining connected to the company until 1944. He sang often at Germany's Bayreuth Festival, too. His first Bayreuth appearance occurred in 1928, and he returned there regularly until 1942. Above all, he was famed for his performances of heroic baritone roles such as that of Wotan in Die Walk√ºre and Das Rheingold. He was equally renowned for his assumption of the dramatically demanding part of Hans Sachs in The Mastersingers of Nuremberg. Bockelmann enjoyed a successful overseas career as well. He undertook many guest performances prior to World War II at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London, and at the Chicago Opera in the United States, performing Wagner's works in the main.Ernst Klee:The Encyclopedia of Persons of the Third Reich. Who was What before and after 1945?. S. Fischer, Frankfurt 2007, p. 61 In 1937, Bockelmann joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party) and was registered under the membership number 5.849.261. He then became a member of the Pr√§sidialbeirat Comradeship of German Artists within the Ministry of Arts. In August 1944, during the final phase of World War II, Adolf Hitler included him in the Gottbegnadeten list, which gave the names of the most important artists active in Germany under the Third Reich. He was also appointed a music professor to the Imperial School of Music in Salzburg. Bockelmann made a number of 78-rpm recordings of Wagnerian arias and other pieces of vocal music in the 1930s and '40s, including songs with a Nazi agenda. His voice was impressively powerful, steady and wide-ranging, with a warm and attractive timbre. It can be heard on various CD re-issues. After World War II, Bockelmann was criticised for his Nazi links and his career was restricted thenceforth to the German stage. He sang mainly at the Hamburg State Opera and Hans Hotter succeeded him as Germany's foremost heroic baritone in the international arena. His death occurred in 1958 at the age of 66, in Dresden.

Vampires are the only supernatural beings who have announced their existence to the human public; however, almost all human governing officials know of the remaining supernatural species. Prior to Some Girls Bite, Chicago's Mayor, Seth Tate, created the Ombudsman's office to funnel all supernatural issues into one office.Some Girls Bite and Friday Night Bites  Vampires  The vampire world is organized through a feudal-like system with masters in charge of each house. Vampires are to swear alliance to their Masters during Commendation ceremonies and from then on are to faithfully serve their Houses and Masters. There are 12 houses in the United States: McDonald, Cabot, Taylor, Lincoln, Washington, Heart, Lassiter, Murphey, Sheridan, Cadogan, Navarre, and Grey‚Äîthe latter three of which are located in Chicago. Navarre House, the oldest house in Chicago, was founded before the Great Chicago Fire by Master Celina Desaulniers. Navarre's current master is Morgan Greer. Cadogan House, founded by Peter Cadogan, is the second oldest and only house in Chicago that still drinks from humans (there are two others worldwide). Cadogan's current Master is Ethan Sullivan who protects 380 vampire members nationally, 97 of whom live in the house located in Hyde Park. Grey House, the youngest in Chicago, is run by its sports-obsessed Master Scott Grey. There is also a faction of rogue vampires around the United States who do not have affiliations with any of the Houses; for political purposes, they are represented by Noah Beck. Vampires in North America and Western Europe are politically organized/controlled by the Greenwich Presidium, a governing body headed by Darius West. Vampires are evaluated on Phys (physical strength, stamina) Psych (psychic and mental abilities), and Strat (strategic and ally consideration) and fight with a mix of Judo, Iaid≈ç, Kendo, and Kenjutsu, often using a katana. Chicagoland vampires' eyes silver when they are angered or excited. Unlike other vampire series, these vampires become unconscious when the sun rises and not only eat food but crave it.  Shapeshifters  Shapeshifters are the supernatural group with the largest numbers‚Äîover 3000 within the United States. They are born with the ability to shift freely from human to animal (usually with one specific animal and human form). They are politically organized into packs, four of which exist in the United States. The Central North American Pack is the most notable pack within the series. It is led by Apex Gabriel Keene. Shifters and vampires have a tenuous relationship since the Second Clearings, when shifters purportedly retreated to Alaska, blended in with the Wilderness, and forced the vampires to fight for themselves.  Sorcerers and witches  While all supernaturals contain elements of magic, sorcerers and witches have the ability to harness and manipulate that magic. Their powers are broken down into four classes (based on knowledge of the so-called minor and major Keys). They are politically organized under a large union‚Äîthe Order (Union of Amalgamated Sorcerers and Spellcasters)‚Äîwhich is broken down into local chapters.  Nymphs  Nymphs are small, slim, busty, doe-eyed, moody females prone to tears and territorial behavior. They are known for their ability to control and manipulate men, and in Chicago, for their considerable control of the Chicago River's currents.  Fairies  Fairies comprise the external security company that protects the Cadogan Vampire House. This arrangement comes to a dramatic end due to the events of the seventh book, House Rules. Angels and demons Messengers of Peace and Messengers of Justice, respectively.  Characters   Caroline Evelyn Merit  Known by her last name, Merit is a dark-haired, blue-eyed, 27-year-old English graduate student at the University of Chicago, working on her dissertation (Romantic Medieval literature) when she is bitten. She is an avid fan of the Bears and the Cubs, musicals, and was a former ballet dancer. Her fashion sense consists of T-shirts, jeans and Pumas rather than the couture associated with Cadogan House. From the beginning of Book 1, she fosters a mutual hatred and attraction/passion toward Ethan Sullivan, her Master. At the end of Some Girls Bite, Ethan names her Sentinel of the Cadogan House, a traditional role not utilized in the houses for quite a long time. Merit has a brother and sister, Charlotte and Robert. In Hard Bitten we learn that Merit had another sister that died in a car accident that nearly killed Joshua and Meredith Merit, as well. Her father gave Merit the name Caroline, her dead sister's name, as a way to grieve and remember his lost daughter. Merit has always thought of herself as a replacement for the lost Caroline. She has been deemed a \\"strong- minded, sharp-witted heroine\\". Merit and Ethan get engaged in Midnight Marked. They get married in Blade Bound and have a daughter named Elisa.Some Girls Bite, Library Journal  Mallory Delancey Carmichael  Mallory is Merit's blue-eyed, blue-haired roommate and long-time friend. She lost her parents in car accident years ago and inherited the house she and Merit live in from her great-aunt Rose. In Some Girls Bite, Mallory works as an ad executive for McGettrick-Combs. After Merit is turned, she begins to show signs of being a witch. She then becomes both romantically involved with and trained by Catcher Bell. She falls under the influence of powerful dark magic in Drink Deep and briefly turns evil, creating havoc until the dark magic object is destroyed in Biting Cold. She serves magical probation under the watchful eye of the North Atlantic Central Pack for a while. She and Catcher get married at the end of Dark Debt. They have a child at the end of Blade Bound.  Ethan Sullivan  Ethan, sometimes referred to as \\"Darth Sullivan\\" by Merit and Mallory, is the 394-year-old Master of Cadogan House. He was turned during the Thirty Years' War at the age of 30 and is described in Some Girls Bite as being 6'3\\", lean, with broad shoulders, long legs, straight, shoulder-length, golden blond hair, knife-edge cheekbones, a firm jaw, and a strong brow. He is known for his impeccable black Armani suits. As demonstrated by the tension between the characters in Some Girls Bite, Ethan and Merit have an on-again, off-again romance for a little while. They start officially dating in Biting Cold. He proposes to Merit in Midnight Marked. They get married and have a daughter named Elisa in Blade Bound. He also gives Merit the nickname \\"Duchess\\".  Morgan Greer  In Some Girls Bite, Morgan is revealed to serve in the position of Second in Navarre House. He has dark brown, cropped, wavy hair, a cleft chin, and a strong jaw. He is a Packer fan, born in Madison, and operates the night club Red, which he inherited from his father. Morgan reveals his feelings for Merit in Some Girls Bite. He becomes head of Navarre at the end of Some Girls Bite. Morgan asks Ethan for the official right to court Merit, but to no avail; the relationship never blossoms. His sustained affiliation with the evil previous head of his house causes concern for Merit, especially considering that Celina is determined to kill Merit.  Catcher Bell  In Some Girls Bite, Catcher is introduced as a former sorcerer who works in the office of the Chicago supernatural Ombudsman. He is a gruff 29-year-old with a shaved head, tattoos, and pale green eyes. In Friday Night Bites, he is kicked out of the Order for unknown reasons connected to his desire to stay in Chicago. He is an expert in the Second of the Four Magical Keys and becomes involved with Mallory Carmichael. Although this relationship is strained to the breaking point due to the events of Drink Deep and Biting Cold, it shows signs of recovering.  Jeff Christopher  Jeff, introduced in Some Girls Bite, is a tall, lanky, mop-topped, 21-year-old computer prodigy and shapeshifter of unknown shape. He is an employee of Chicago's supernatural Ombudsman. He becomes involved with Fallon Keene in Twice Bitten, though he still lightheartedly flirts with Merit relentlessly. It is later revealed that Jeff is a large white tiger, proving that looks can definitely be deceiving.  Chuck Merit  Chuck, Merit's grandfather, is introduced in Some Girls Bite as a former cop and, much to Merit's surprise, is currently Chicago's ombudsman - a liaison who links the human and supernatural worlds.  Joshua Merit  Joshua is Merit's father, and is introduced in Some Girls Bite. He is tall and lean with chestnut hair and blue eyes. He is the CEO of Merit Properties, a real estate development company that manages high-rises and apartment complexes throughout Chicago. He is a powerful (and manipulative) member of the Chicago Growth Council. He seems to have his own interests in the supernatural world, and is not above utilizing his daughter to satisfy his desires. His relationship with Merit is strained. He offers to pay Ethan Sullivan to make Merit a vampire, but is denied. After Merit finds out about this, their relationship becomes even more strained. However, it is shown in rare moments that he does care for his daughter.  Meredith Merit  Meredith is Merit's mother, and is introduced in Some Girls Bite. A woman of propriety, she has blonde, well-coiffed hair and is always dressed perfectly.  Charlotte Merit  Merit's sister, Charlotte, is introduced in Friday Night Bites. She is married to Major Corkburger. They have a baby, Olivia, and an older daughter, Mary Katherine.

Robert Merit  Robert, Merit's older brother, is referenced in Some Girls Bite and Friday Night Bites, and is being groomed to take over the family business. Merit's father reveals that he wants Merit to assist Robert in making connections to Chicago's supernatural communities.  Lindsey  Lindsey is introduced in Some Girls Bite as a Cadogan House vampire. She has been in the House for 115 years and is the resident psychic. She is a blonde known for her stilettos and designer jeans. Originally from Iowa, she is an avid Yankees fan who maintains a rather confused relationship with Luc in Books 1 and 2, and finally begins dating him in Hard Bitten, having been brought together by grief. She is close friends with Merit from the beginning, and they grow close working together in the guard.  Luc  Luc is Captain of the Cadogan Guards and is introduced in Some Girls Bite He is quite the cowboy. He is a rule-bound dutiful Guard who is respected and trusted by Ethan. Luc is secretly interested in Lindsey, a fellow guard.  Peter (Spencer)  Peter is introduced in Some Girls Bite as a Cadogan Guard. He is approximately six feet tall, with a thin build and brown hair just past his shoulders. He has been in Cadogan for 38 years and is known for his \\"contacts.\\" He betrays Cadogan House at the end of Friday Night Bites.  Juliet  Another Cadogan Guard introduced in Some Girls Bite, Juliet is an 85-year-old, fey-like redhead who has been in Cadogan for 54 years.  Kelley  Kelley is a 214-year-old, dark-haired Cadogan Guard known for her mechanical and software genius. She is introduced in Some Girls Bite.  Malik Washington Malik serves as Cadogan House Second.

Mayor Seth Tate  Named \\"America's Sexiest Politician,\\" Tate is a 36-year-old, darkly handsome man (later found out to be a messenger of peace gone bad, aka angel) who, in Friday Night Bites is revealed to have mistresses throughout Chicago. While serving his second term, he founds the Ombudsman's office and has a particular interest in the political power of the vampire community. In Hard Bitten, it is discovered that he is pushing drugs to rogue vampires, causing them to lose control, and is also aiding Celina in her attempts to destroy Merit and Cadogan House. Arrested and imprisoned, he is freed by the prejudiced new mayor in Biting Cold, where it is revealed that he is a \\"messenger of peace\\" or an angel, possessed by his twin brother, Domanic, who is a rogue \\"messenger of justice\\" or demon.  Gabriel Keene  Garbriel Keene, introduced in Friday Night Bites, is Apex of the Central North American pack of shapeshifters. He is married to Tonya, who is pregnant with Connor in Friday Night Bites.  Lacey Sheridan  A former Cadogan House guard, Lindsey reveals in Friday Night Bites that Lacey Sheridan is the only Master vampire Ethan has nominated for Testing.

When she returns, she tries to break Ethan and Merit up by stating that Merit is cheating on Ethan.  Jonah  Jonah is a member of Grey House and the Red Guard. When Merit is offered a place with the Red Guard, Jonah is to be her partner. Jonah works with Merit in Hard Bitten to convince her to become a member of the Red Guard. He falls for Merit but keeps his distance when Ethan comes back. He and Merit share a platonic relationship. He crossed paths with Merit once before (when she was human) as her sister's boyfriend, although Merit doesn't remember him from then, and he takes it personally (this is one of the reasons he doesn't like her in the beginning).  Book summaries  Some Girls Bite  At the beginning of Some Girls Bite, Merit lives with her roommate and best friend Mallory in their Wicker Park brownstone. She is attacked on campus late at night on her way back from the library, and is turned vampire by Ethan Sullivan in order to save her life. She is given an invitation to join Cadogan House and a week to decide her allegiances before the House's Commendation ceremony. As Merit attempts to adjust and understand the attack on her life, she learns that her grandfather works as a liaison in the Mayor's Ombudsman's office for the supernaturals of the city. As the Chicago police continue to investigate the vampire community's connection to the murders, Merit faces a slew of new and difficult situations involving her roommate, her new (hunky) Master, his \\"girlfriend/consort,\\" the (also hunky) Second of the Navarre House, her grandfather and his co-workers, and the mysterious and sultry Celina. While coping with her new \\"vampire-ness,\\" its thirst, and its required training, Merit must also decide where her new allegiances lie and who she can trust. English graduate student no more, Merit must make a quick adjustment to her new existence‚Äîboth her life and the lives of those around her depend on it.  Friday Night Bites  Friday Night Bites takes place about two weeks after the conclusion of Some Girls Bite; Merit is making plans to move into Cadogan House, and the vampire community itself has gained a certain level of celebrity. There is word that the shifter pack leader Gabriel Keene intends to hold a shapeshifters' conference in Chicago, and there are rumors that the Chicago World Weekly, and Jamie Breckenridge in particular, is taking a particular interest in the underground vampire raves (flash mobs of sorts that meet and mass feed). In order to quell any unsavory press and understand Jamie's motive, Ethan asks Merit to return to her family and their high society connections. As Merit and Ethan hobnob with Chicago's high society, a boyfriend from Merit's past brings new trouble for the vampire community. Merit's allegiances, strength, and willpower continue to be tested as human- supernatural relationship become increasingly tense and tenuous.  Twice Bitten  Twice Bitten starts where Friday Night Bites leaves off. Merit is adjusting to finally completing the change. Her attraction to Ethan Sullivan is being put towards the back of her mind. She is concentrating on more important things, such as protecting Gabriel Keene, the shifters' pack leader. Merit has a big secret which she is keeping from everyone. A secret society of vampires is attempting to recruit her. They think she could be a big help. One night Merit and Ethan go on a mission to help bring the shape shifters to Chicago. It is at a bar. The leaders from all four shape shifter divisions are in attendance. At some point the bar is under an attack of gunfire. Merit, as Sentinel, is supposed to be protecting the House ruler Sullivan. In reality, Sullivan is the one to jump onto Merit and protect her from the gunfire. During the attack, Merit notices the cook is about to walk into the gunfire. She jumps out and saves the woman from any serious damage, sustaining a few injuries that heal quickly, but gaining appreciation and respect from some of the shifters. The romance between Sullivan and Merit picks up at this point. They take a pizza back to Sullivan's room and open a bottle of wine. Merit has no thoughts in her mind about what is about to happen. They are enjoying the pizza when talk turns to how Sullivan put his life in danger for Merit. Talk leads to them finally sleeping together. That night everything is perfect between Merit and Sullivan. It's the next day that ruins everything. The next day, Merit and Sullivan go to yet another shifter meeting where Merit encounters a rough shifter. The shifter picks a fight with Merit and starts to physically attack her when Sullivan steps in with a little too much power. This does not help the matters between shifters and vampires. The two leave shortly after the encounter. On the way home, Sullivan tells Merit that he can no longer have a personal relationship with her. Things are too complicated between the two of them. Sullivan is the leader of the House and needs to protect all of the vampires there. But Merit makes him only want to protect her. Ethan suggests that everything must be strictly professional between them. Things get to be a little crazy between Merit and Sullivan. There is constant tension between the two. The day after the break-up, Sullivan's old mistress Lacey Sheridan shows up. This causes Merit to be pushed more towards the secret vampire society that Sullivan despises. Finally the day comes where the shifters decide to stay in Chicago. A number of different instances of violence come up. Merit helps put them to an end, but Sullivan speaks about his feelings towards Merit. Merit will have nothing to do with it. She tells him to stop. They are after all working strictly professional. The night ends, and Keene remains alive. The next day, Sullivan is hosting a party for their guest Sheridan. Sullivan and Merit have another talk inside his office. He once again tries to share how he feels with Merit. He tries to tell her how much he loves her and that the visit from Sheridan has been planned for months. The talk ends a little rough between the two. Merit leaves to go for a walk. On the walk, Keene's brother tells her to get into the limo with him because Gabriel has asked for her. Once there, Merit realizes that this is a setup. She talks Gabriel from killing her childhood friend and that his brother is setting them up. Merit witnesses a shifter shifting into his animal. Gabriel and his brother get into a fight. Gabriel is the winner, but at the end of the fight Merit receives a 911-page from the House. There was a breach into the house. Gabriel's brother informs them that he has sent all the mad shifters to attack Sullivan's house. Merit makes a quick call to the secret society of vampires and then heads over to the House. Once there, she moves her way slowly towards Sullivan. At first she cannot get through their special vampire connection of minds. Once through, Sullivan thanks God that she is safe. Merit fights her way into Sullivan's office. The two fight back- to-back. They take out all the shifters and humans who pose a threat to them. Merit turns to Sullivan when he pulls her into an intense kiss. Later outside, Gabriel is making a public statement about shape shifters being real. Their cover was blown by a fellow shifter healing himself. Now the world knows about shifters and vampires. At the end of the novel, Sullivan visits Merit in her room. He goes into how he was wrong about them never being able to be a couple. Last night proved that they have great chemistry fighting together. Merit turns down the offer to join the society. Her heart belongs to Sullivan's house and no other.  Hard Bitten  Cadogan House is being picketed by protestors and an ex-military man named McKetrick. Ethan is summoned to Mayor Tate's mansion at Creeley Creek to discuss reports of an illegal rave that turned violent, leading to the deaths of three women. Tate threatens Ethan with an arrest warrant if any more humans are killed. Merit, with the help of Red Guard member Jonah, visits a rave, and finds a new drug called \\"V\\" that wipes away the inhibitions of vampires making them moody and volatile. When she returns to Cadogan with news of more illegal raves, she bursts in on a meeting of Ethan and the Greenwich Presidium representative, Darius. Darius insists no one take any action that will make the House, the GP, and the vampires look bad, but Merit and two other Novitiates go to Temple Bar to try to ferret out the drug and its makers/distributors. A fight breaks out because of vampires using V, and Merit is caught up in it, and questioned by the CPD and the Ombud's office. Using Jeff's computer skills and the surveillance cameras, she is led to a criminal named Paulie, who works for Celina distributing V. After chasing down Paulie, and getting Celina arrested for admitting her part in the scheme, Merit finds that Paulie has been working with Mayor Tate the whole time, as has Celina. She goes to confront them, and the mayor tells her her father paid Ethan to turn her into a vampire. Ethan tries to explain, and Celina, high on V and controlled by some unknown magic, tries to stake Merit. Ethan jumps in the way, and is killed; Merit then stakes Celina, killing her as well. Paulie and the mayor are arrested, and Cadogan House mourns the loss of their Master. After a week of self-pity, Mallory convinces Merit to ask her father if he paid Ethan off. Her father admits that he offered, but Ethan did not accept. Celina heard about the offer and was jealous; she found a Rogue to kill Merit, and Ethan turned her. At the end, Merit visits Malik, the new House Master, after Ethan died, to return to her job.  Drink Deep   Biting Cold  Hunting Mallory, Merit and Ethan are briefly met and engaged by Seth Tate, released by the mayor. After forcing them off the road, Tate leaves and hunts the book also. Reaching the safety of the Order's Archivist's house, Ethan and Merit face down a vengeful Mallory, who wreaks havoc before teleporting away. Realizing that Mallory and Tate have teamed up, and that Mallory was serving as a distraction for Tate, Ethan and Merit head back to the bunker, where they engage in a heated battle with Tate and Mallory but are unable to prevent Mallory from completing her spell and destroying the book, causing Tate to split in two. After handing Mallory off to the shifters, who arrive to take the book, Ethan and Merit, along with the Archivist, hunt for clues to Tate's heritage. They eventually learn that Seth Tate was an angel possessed by a demon, his twin brother Domonic. As they hunt for Domonic, and come under closer scrutiny from Chicago's prejudiced major, Merit learns of an affair between Domonic and the queen of the fairies. Eventually, with the queen's help, they corner Domonic. Together with Ethan, Mallory, and Catcher, Merit manages to capture Domonic. Before she can kill him, Seth stops her and requests that he do it himself, feeling responsible for the lives that Domonic has destroyed in his brief reign of terror. The book ends with Seth killing Domonic with Merit's blade. During all this, Cadogan House must decide whether they truly need the Greenwich Presidium.  House Rules  The Greenwich Presidium is inventorying their house and is determined to leave Cadogan penniless as an object lesson to any other house wishing to leave or disobey their rules. When they are not satisfied with what they can wrangle out of Cadogan legally, based on the treaty signed by Peter Cadogan, they turn to force. Bribing the fairies assigned to guard Cadogan onto their side with the promise of returning to them the Dragon's Egg, an item of great importance to the fairies that has been in Cadogan's possession for centuries, they attempt to bully Ethan and Merit and all their vampires out of their very home. In the midst of this, Lacey Sheridan is back and determined to undermine Merit's relationship with Ethan. Merit's affiliation with the Red Guard is revealed to Ethan. A crazed killer is on the loose and his target of choice is vampires. Juggling many crises at once, Merit uses her RG contacts to suss out the location of the Dragon's Egg, returning it to Ethan, nullifying the fairies' deal with the GP. Ethan uses the attack to break out of the contract signed by Peter Cadogan by pointing out that the GP broke its word when it raised arms against Cadogan before Cadogan was officially outside the GP's protection, allowing him to keep everything. Without allies and with the law on the side of their enemies, the GP leaves. Meanwhile, Merit uses her father's contacts to hunt down the vampire killer, eventually uncovering a dark story of forced changes and torture leading back 95 years, and discovering that the killer is none other than the security consultant Ethan hired to protect Cadogan vampires against GP hostility. Just as they realize this, they receive an urgent phone call from the GP; Darius and another GP member have been captured by the crazed vampire and it is up to Merit, Ethan and Jonah to save them.

The wingspan is 35‚Äì45 mm. The moth flies from May to July; the larvae remain from July to September. There is one generation per year. The larvae go through five instars; the final instar is black at the ends, with a yellow or orange middle section, which in some populations has black spots. The larvae feed on the leaves of poplar and willow, but also feed on alder, basswood, birch, maple and oak.

It was part of the process of drafting and adopting the current German constitution, the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). The draft document prepared by the Herrenchiemsee convention served as a starting point for the deliberations of the Parlamentarischer Rat in Bonn during 1948 and 1949. Proceedings On 1 July 1948 the Western Allies had officially recommended the implementation of a West German state by handing out the \\"Frankfurt Documents\\" to the minister-presidents and governing mayors of the Western occupation zones. From 8 to 10 July the minister-presidents met at Koblenz and proclaimed the establishment of a Federal Republic of Germany, which should only be a provisional arrangement but not a successor state of the German Reich. Chaired by the representative of the Bavarian State Chancellery, the convention was inaugurated on August 10 at the Herrenchiemsee \\"Old Palace\\", a former residence of King Ludwig II. The assembly did not adopt an official name, it was later called Herrenchiemsee Convention by the members of the Parlamentarischer Rat. Every West German state was represented by an expert, the West Berlin deputy Otto Suhr due to Allied reservations attended the meeting as a non-voting \\"guest\\". Three committees were established, which until August 23 drafted a nearly complete concept of a new German constitution, whereby the basic principles of the Basic Law were fixed: *A bicameral system of a directly elected federal parliament (the later Bundestag) and a representation of the German states. No agreement was reached on the configuration of the second chamber; instead of a genuine Senate \\"upper house\\", the Bundesrat legislative body was implemented in 1949. *The Cabinet of Germany as the federal executive body is dependent on a majority in the parliament, provided that it is able to fulfil the task of forming a government. The confidence of the parliament is essential but also sufficient for the head of government (i.e. the Chancellor). *A negative majority shall not prevent the formation of the government nor just overthrow it (see: Constructive vote of no confidence). *Beside the head of government is a neutral legitimizing head of state (the President of Germany) with limited executive powers. *The President is neither allowed to take emergency measures (Notverordnungen as according to Article 48 of the 1919 Weimar Constitution) nor to execute federal laws in the States, these rights are reserved for the German government and the States' chamber. *The execution of federal laws is supervised by the federal judicial system. *The States are most responsible for legislation, administration, justice and financing. *States and federal government prepare and execute separate budgets. *The instruments of direct democracy on federal level are limited: there is no provision of a country- wide referendum, a plebiscite shall only be held to adopt a new constitution. *Any constitutional amendment in order to abolish the fundamental principles of human dignity or the republican, democratic and federal form of government is illegal‚Äîsee: Eternity clause. The federal character of the Herrenchiemsee draft corresponded with the assignment of the convention by the German States. It was adopted by a minister-presidents' conference before it was forwarded to the Parlamentarischer Rat. The council in Bonn could rely on a highly qualified conception with several contentious points resolved in advance, though many Social Democratic and Communist deputies originally objected against a too strong exertion of influence by the States' governments.

The line originally had 19 employees and it is now a Canadian Pacific internal shortline railway, with a unique collective agreement and employee-managed operation.Shenfield, Ponak and Painter: \\"Beyond Collision: High Integrity Labour Relations - CPR Short-line Railway Case Study\\" . Route Originally built by the Ontario and Quebec Railway, which was leased by the CPR for 999 years, the Havelock Subdivision originally began at Glen Tay. In fact, the mile posts on this route are still measured in miles from Glen Tay. The section between Glen Tay and Havelock was abandoned in stages until the present mileage remains: Mile 90.8 near Havelock westward to Mile 182.4 which is the junction with the CP Belleville Sub at Kennedy in Toronto. The Nephton Subdivision extends from Mile 93.7 at Havelock to Blue Mountain, a distance of twenty track miles. Crews are based at Havelock and Peterborough. Havelock crews run trains to Toronto Agincourt Yard and return (Train 90/91 now known as T07/08) as well as to Blue Mountain via Nephton and back. The railway primarily serves the nepheline syenite mines owned by Unimin Canada at Blue Mountain and Nephton.Mines and Aggregates Safety and Health Association: \\"Unimin Nephton\\" This line also served the former 3M plant east of Havelock. Other customers are served by Peterborough-based crews including Quaker Oats, Canadian General Electric, and formerly United Canadian Malt, Kingdon Lumber/TIM-BR MART, and Poly Tubes receives plastic pellets by rail within the City of Peterborough. Waste product from Quaker Oats is also offloaded at Harper road and elevated into trucks for use in wood stove pellet production. As well, Cavan Agri Products receives carloads of grain, feed, and potash at Cavan. The method of control is Rule 105 from the end of track east of Havelock to the begin/end main track sign just west of Havelock, Occupancy Control System (OCS) from the begin/end main track sign to Mile 178 just outside Toronto Yard. Beyond Toronto Yard, the Havelock Sub is CTC to the junction with the CP Belleville Sub. The entire Nephton Sub is under OCS. In the 1980s CN abandoned its operations in the area, and KLR has assumed their customers and two sections of remaining CN trackage, including a swing bridge, within the city of Peterborough. In September 2012, Canadian Pacific announced that they are considering closing the former Grand Junction Railway of Canada/CN spur dbecause ofdeteriorating condition of the track and swing bridge. The line is currently locked off by Engineering services due to bridge condition. This would leave the businesses in the south end Industrial section such as Poly Tubes without rail service. The former CN spur that also serves United Canada Malt was locked off and closed in October 2014. The City of Peterborough is buying these former CN lines as well as the section crew office on Rink St. for use as recreational trails once the abandonment process is finalized. During the 1990s, GE Capital ran a rail car repair centre on the south side of the Havelock rail yard at the old CP roundhouse location. CP crews brought cars in from Toronto for repairs and shipped them out when they were finished. The location is now the current office for local section and rail crews since GE closed the shop, and the train station was sold off. The former Canadian Pacific station, next to the Havelock rail yard, has been restored and operated as a restaurant since 2004. The train hijacking scene in the 1984 film Martin's Day was filmed at mile marker 10/Peterborough County Rd. #44 crossing of the Nepthon Subdivision north of Havelock, Ontario. Traffic With the elimination of passenger service on January 14, 1990, the typical weekly traffic now consists of freight. Possibility of passenger rail In 2008, the federal government announced plans to restart passenger rail service to Peterborough from Toronto. The service would be operated by Via Rail, but it has been estimated that it would carry fewer than 100 passengers per day.Campion-Smith, Bruce. \\"Via, Ottawa at odds over Peterborough line\\" The Toronto Star. Via Rail cited the high cost per passenger that resulted in cancellation of the service in 1990; however, the government of the day had actually decided that Via Rail should serve intercity passengers only and felt that the Havelock traffic clearly belonged to the commuter market serviced by GO Transit.Peterborough Examiner - BRENDAN WEDLEY TCRC. GO Transit has a contingency plan for establishing rail service to Peterborough but also has studies and plans that cover a range of eventualities including electrifying the entire Lakeshore route and service to Collingwood, Ontario. In 2011, a group named the Shining Waters Railway was established with the goals of inheriting the Kawartha Lakes Railway's two subdivisions, the Havelock and Nephton from CP Rail to continue freight service and even resume passenger rail service from Toronto to Peterborough and beyond (in a partnership with GO Train, VIA Rail, or another partner).

The three engines were intended to provide the reliability needed for overnight flights, but the 350 came out very overweight. Only one was built. Design and development The Lat√©co√®re 350, or 35-0 as it was first called, was a direct development of the successful single-engined passenger carrying Lat√©co√®re 28. To increase cruising speed and, in particular to provide reliability for night flying, the new design had three engines. Apart from the immediate changes this involved and a modest increase in wingspan, the 350 and the 28 had much in common, both in structural detail and in general appearance. Both were high wing, strut braced monoplanes with enclosed cockpits and fixed undercarriages. The two extra engines of the 350 were mounted at the ends of stub wings, more streamlined support structures than lifting surfaces, which extended horizontally from the lower fuselage longerons. Each was further stabilised by a pair of struts from the upper part of the engine mounting to the wing roots. The outer engines were mounted as close together as possible, to minimize the couple resulting from the loss of power of one of them. They were housed in long, well streamlined cowlings that reached back as far as the wing trailing edge. The third engine was in the nose, as in the Lat√©co√®re 28. All the engines were 400 hp (298 kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Jb V-12 twelve water-cooled units. Three separate radiators for them were fixed under the stub wing. The wings had constant chord with roughly elliptical tips, with roots joining the upper longerons. On each side, a pair of streamlined struts from the front and rear wing spars at mid-span transmitted lift loads to the end of the stub wing. There was another, slighter pair of struts from each engine mounting vertically to the wing. The wing structure was mostly metal, with some wooden components, then fabric covered. Each wing carried a pair of ailerons with trim tabs to reduce control loads. The fuselage was built around the usual four metal longerons and covered with an aluminium skin. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side with dual control in an enclosed cabin just ahead of the leading edge, with fuselage windows on either side for lateral and downward vision. Access to the large passenger cabin, 4.60 m long, was via a radio compartment. The cabin seated ten passengers, five down each side with their own window. At the back were baggage spaces and toilet facilities. Passengers entered by a port-side door and luggage loaded through a door on the other side. The empennage was very similar to that of the Lat√©co√®re 28, with a nearly triangular tailplane carrying split, tabbed elevators. The fin was also triangular, with a semi-circular, unbalanced but tabbed rudder. The undercarriage units were mounted at the end of each stub-wing, giving it a wide 5.70 m (18 ft 8 in) track. The wheels were large, with low pressure tyres of 1,150 mm diameter and 250 mm width (45 √ó 10 in). Each unit had an axle, articulated at the lower longeron, and a pair of oleo legs fixed to the stub wing where the lift struts joined. The Lat√©co√®re 350 first flew on 2 February 1931, piloted by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. It turned out that the 350 had come out more than 30% overweight, an excess of about a tonne. Consequently, the useful load was reduced from the design estimate of 1,000 kg (2,205 lbs) to about 350 kg (772 lbs), making the 350 quite unfit for purpose. In view of that, it hardly mattered that flight tests showed that some of the performance estimates were optimistic: maximum speed was 5% less and the stalling speed higher. Since the aircraft was government funded and its property, Saint- Exup√©ry flew it to Villacoublay early in 1933. Its career thereafter is not recorded.

ReL, whose president is Fabrizio Cicchitto, has been associated with The People of Freedom (PdL), a political party, until 2013 and is now close to New Centre-Right (NCD). ReL aims at strengthening the alliance between Catholics and secular forces, for which Forza Italia was born in 1994. It was launched in November 2009 by Chicchitto, a former member of the Italian Socialist Party, along with other former Socialists, including Francesco Forte (who serves as president of ReL's scientific committee), Ugo Finetti, Margherita Boniver, Giuliano Cazzola, Francesco Colucci (leader of We Reformers), Pier Luigi Borghini, Giancarlo Lehner, Sergio Pizzolante (active also in Young Italy), Chiara Moroni, Alfredo Pallone, Fiamma Nirenstein, Carlo Ripa di Meana. In order to fulfill its goal of uniting the different political traditions represented in the Italian centre-right, the think tank includes also some liberals, such as Luigi Compagna and Nicol√≤ Zanon, some liberal Christian democrats, including Sandro Fontana and Gianstefano Frigerio, and some leading liberal-conservatives from National Alliance, such as Gennaro Malgieri and Paolo Armaroli. In October 2012 Cicchitto launched the \\"For a Lib-Lab manifesto\\" initiative along with other like-minded members of the PdL, including Renato Brunetta (Free Foundation), Stefano Caldoro and Lucio Barani (New Italian Socialist Party), and Giuseppe Calderisi (a former leading member of Liberal Reformers).

Swarthmore, Pennsylvania: Swarthmore College, 1933. was a Dutch Quaker historian, of English background. Life He was son of Jacob Williamson Sewel, a free citizen and surgeon of Amsterdam where he was born. His paternal grandfather, William Sewel, a Brownist of Kidderminster, emigrated from England to escape religious persecution, and married a native of Utrecht. His mother, Judith Zinspenning, daughter of a German Catholic, afterwards a Baptist, joined the Quakers in 1657, after hearing William Ames. She became an eloquent minister, visited England in 1663, was author of A Serious Reproof to the Flemish Baptists, 1660, a Book of Proverbs (translated into English by William Caton, London, 1663), An Epistle, and other short books. She died at Amsterdam on 10 September 1664, aged 34. Her husband predeceased her. Sewel was brought up by an uncle. At eight he was fairly proficient in Latin, but was soon apprenticed to a weaver. At fourteen he visited his mother's friends in England. Returning to Holland after a sojourn of ten months, he obtained work as a translator, contributed regularly to the Amsterdam Courant and other papers, wrote verses, and conducted a periodical. In spite of an invitation from William Penn to become master of the Quaker school opened at Bristol, Sewel remained in Amsterdam until his death on 13 March 1720. He was married, with a family. Works Sewel spent 25 years on his major work, The History of the Rise, Increase, and Progress of the Christian People called Quakers. It was first published in Dutch, as Histori van de Opkompste, Aanwas en Voortgang der Christenen bekend by den naam van Quakers, Amsterdam, 1717 (another edition, 1742). The English edition (London, 1722), dedicated to George I, was largely undertaken to correct Historia Quakeriana (Amsterdam, 1695; English translation, London, 1696, by Gerard Croese, to whom Sewel had given letters and narratives from England). Sewel's own work was based on a mass of correspondence, George Fox's Journal, and, for the public history, Lord Clarendon's Rebellion and Edmund Ludlow's Memoirs. It became an authority.The History was reprinted, London, 1725, 1795, 2 vols. 1779‚Äì80, 1811, and 6th ed. 1834. American editions appeared at Philadelphia, 1728, and 1832 (cf. Hildeburn, Issues of the Philadelphia Press, i. 92‚Äì3), Burlington, New Jersey, 1774; and New York, 1844, 2 vols. (with a life of the author). It was translated into German as Die Geschichte von dem Ursprung, 1742, and abridged for children, London, 1864. Sewel's other works are: * A Large Dictionary of English-Dutch, 2 pts.

History The foundation was launched in February 2007 by Gianfranco Fini, leader of National Alliance (AN), and Adolfo Urso, MP for the same party, at a convention that rallied 105 personalities of the culture, economy and arts sectors, including former Constitutional Court President Annibale Marini, TV personality and lawyer Tina Lagostena Bassi, the rector of the Milan Polytechnic Giovanni Azzone, sociologist Sabino Acquaviva, actor Luca Barbareschi, television host Rita Dalla Chiesa and operatic soprano Cecilia Gasdia. According to the founders, FareFuturo hadn't the purpose to succeed AN, but enlarge under a European perspective the culture of the Italian right-wing, re-organizing it after the defeat of the House of Freedoms in the 2006 election. The think tank FareFuturo was officially founded on 15 May 2007 in Rome. Also former Spanish PM Jos√© Aznar attended the foundative meeting, expressing his desire to see AN join in the European People's Party (EPP), the main centre-right party in the European Union. In September 2007, thanks to Aznar's pressure, FareFuturo attende the meeting of the Centre for European Studies, the EPP's think tank. In April 2009, a statement of political analyst Sofia Ventura about the TV showgirls (veline) involvement in Italian politics, published on the web- magazine of FareFuturo, caused polemics and criticisms also inside the same political area of the foundation, especially about the presumed attitude of Fini's main ally Silvio Berlusconi. In November 2009, FareFuturo started a solid cooperation with FAES, the Aznar's foundation. In 2010, during tensions inside the recently founded The People of Freedom (PdL) party between Berlusconi and Fine, FareFuturo sided with the Finiani, who finally left the party in February 2011 to found Future and Freedom (FLI), a liberal conservative party led by Fini. In March 2011, however, many members left the foundation and the web-magazine was closed. Fini resigned the presidency over the foundation in favour to Urso, who became the new president. Urso rapidly fell in disagreement with the now-centrist policy of Fini, who established the New Pole for Italy, a coalition between FLI, the Union of the Centre (UDC) and API. Instead to re-align the foundation to the PdL, Urso prosecuted a policy of distance between all the centre-right parties, claiming for a \\"popular constituent\\" for the creation of conservative party, who will had to represent the EPP in Italy. To represent this project, in April 2011 Urso created the foundation FareItalia (literally \\"MakeItaly\\"), that in 2013 joined in the national-conservative party Brothers of Italy (FdI), led by Giorgia Meloni. In January 2018, Urso was selected by FdI candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, in prevision to the 2018 election.

After making his debut with Barletta and spending a season in Serie B with Avellino, he made his debut in Serie A with Torino in 1975, at the age of 22. In 1977, he moved to Ascoli for two seasons, scoring 5 goals in 46 appearances, and helping the club to win promotion during the 1977‚Äì78 season; after playing for Taranto, he also won promotion to Serie A with Cesena during the 1980‚Äì81 season.

International career Roccotelli was called up to the Italy national football team by Enzo Bearzot but was ultimately not capped at that level. Style of play and association with the rabona Although he was usually deployed as a winger on the right flank, often wearing the number 7 shirt, Roccotelli was also deployed as a left-back or as a forward on occasion. A talented, creative and skilful right-footed player, he was a powerful striker and passer of the ball, who possessed good technique. Known for his flair, dribbling ability, and his use of feints and tricks on the ball, Roccotelli is credited with popularising the rabona in Italy during the 1970s; at that time, the move was simply called a \\"crossed-kick\\", as he placed his right foot behind his left in order to strike the ball.

Early life Paltos was born \\"Nicholas George Paltos\\" (or possibly \\"Nicholas John Paltos\\". ) in 1940 or 1941 on the small Greek island of Kastelorizon The youngest of ten children, his family migrated from Greece to Melbourne, Australia in 1947. After the death of his mother in 1949, his family moved to Sydney in 1955, where he first became acquainted with gambling, which was to be his downfall. Paltos attended school till he was 13, when he left and worked at a chrome metal factory. In 1955, he moved with his father to Sydney, where he worked as an apprentice in a Sydenham metal factory, completing a diploma course in electroplating. Paltos enrolled at Sydney Technical College in 1959 and took two years to complete his matriculation. He then won a scholarship to study medicine at the University of New South Wales in 1962. After completing studies, he commenced work at the Sydney Hospital in 1969, and in 1978 took up private practice with rooms in Woolloomooloo. Career He studied and worked part-time as a taxi driver and salesman. He also met his future wife, Marie Kratzis, whom he married in January 1967. He completed his studies in 1968 and joined the staff of Sydney Hospital. A year later he was appointed to the emergency and casualty department. Paltos frequented illegal gaming venues, in particular the Goulburn Club, and racecourses. He knew people who moved in that world, including Graham \\"Croc\\" Palmer. He met George Freeman as a doctor and became friends with him. In 1978, Paltos took up private practice in Riley Street, Woolloomooloo. His patients included high-flyers such as former NSW Supreme Court chief justice Laurence Street, media tycoon Kerry Packer and broadcaster John Laws. He warned ex-Goon Harry Secombe that if he did not lose some of his 129 kilograms, he would die. Secombe took that advice and credited Paltos with saving his life. Paltos fathered two children and lived in a two-storey home, Gwandalan, in one of Sydney's most expensive suburbs, Bellevue Hill. His gambling issues continued. In 1982 he borrowed $300,000 from the family company of a solicitor, Ross Karp. In an effort to pay mounting debts he became involved in crimal activity. First conviction In 1986, Paltos pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to import 5.5 tonnes of hashish into Australia.

In 1992, the band added vocalist Sergio Curbelo and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where they created a mix of salsa and heavy metal with the assistance of Jeff Renza and the Noiz Boiz production studio.

There they also met producer Gustavo Santaolalla who signed them to MCA and in 1999 released their second album, Fundamental, which received critical praise. This propelled the band to stardom even landing them in the second stage of Ozzfest where they shared the opening slot with Slipknot in 1999. In 2000, their song \\"T√≠rale\\" was included in the soundtrack of the movie Heavy Metal 2000, and was the collection's only track with Spanish lyrics. The band opened for Sepultura, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pantera and KISS. They also recorded a cover of The Police's \\"Spirits in the Material World\\" in Spanish, with the title \\"Almas en un mundo material\\". Because sales of the band's 2001 album Union did not meet MCA's expectations, the label did not renew the band's contract after it had expired in 2002. Puya reunited in 2009 for two music festivals in Puerto Rico and released the digital EP Areyto on iTunes on August 27, 2010. Puya's most recent performance was on February 8, 2014 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Puya released a new song titled 'Lila Batzen' on 30 August, 2019. In November 2014 Puya anticipate their participation in the festival: Patria Grande that will take place in Cuba In addition, prior to this event, the band also announced a tour in the United States starting September 2014.http://www.hornsuprocks.com/news_view_full.php?id=2275#.U-9pL_l5Nnd PUYA Announces First U.S. Shows In MANY Years! In 2019, Sergio Curbelo left the band. New vocalist, Diego Romero of Trujillo Alto, will replace him as the band works on their upcoming 5th album. Musical style and influences Influenced by Pantera, Rush, Fania All-Stars, Fishbone, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Van Halen and Sepultura, Puya's music draws from diverse styles, including salsa, Cuban rumba, bomba, alternative rock, hard rock, blues rock, heavy metal, jazz and progressive rock. Additionally, some of Puya's songs have also incorporated rapping. The band's music has been categorized as alternative rock, hardcore, hard rock, heavy metal, Latin metal, progressive metal and rock en espa√±ol. Though sometimes categorized as nu metal, this is contested by Latin Music: Musicians, Genres, and Themes, which says that Puya is not a part of this genre and has its own style of music.

The school is part of the Peach County School District, which serves Peach County. Mission Statement: To graduate college and career ready students. Vision Statement: Learning today, Leading tomorrow. Peach County High School (PCHS) is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and the Georgia State Department of Education‚Äôs Professional Standards Commission. PCHS is also a member of the \\"High Schools That Work\\" division of the Southern Regional Education Board and a member of the National Alliance of High Schools.  History  Prior to Integration, black students attending public school in Peach County attended Henry A. Hunt High School (Tigers) and white students attended Fort Valley High School (Green Wave). Like many locations in the southern United States, Peach County did not immediately comply with the federal order to integrate schools. H. A. Hunt High School specifically educated Black Americans during at a time when formal education for black students was virtually non-existent in Peach County. Hunt High was named for the Mr. Henry A. Hunt, second principal of Fort Valley High and Industrial School (now Fort Valley State University). Current School Building Following integration, students continued to attend separate schools, but under a policy of busing. In a 1970 report to the United States Senate, Peach County was listed as being in questionable violation of the federal order to integrate schools. In 1974, with the construction of the present campus, both black and white students attended a fully integrated school. School Prom Integration In the early 1960s the Peach County School Board discontinued school-sanctioned social activities to include proms and homecoming dances on the recommendation of then superintendent Ernest Anderson, who served from 1945 to 1984. Anderson argued such activities interfered with the students' studies. After Peach County schools were formally integrated, parents continued to sponsor private segregated proms for students. This changed in 1990 after parents convinced the school board to rescind the policy and allow for a single, school sanctioned prom. New School Building In September 2019, the school board announced the construction of a new high school. The new school will be located between the cities of Fort Valley and Byron, Georgia. Athletics PCHS athletics are most widely known for having one of the most consistently successful football teams in the state of Georgia. The Peach County Trojans have fielded a winning team each year since 1987 (33 consecutive seasons) and has been in the playoffs each season since 1991 (29 consecutive seasons). The Trojans have won three Georgia High School Association (GHSA) Class AAA state championships, in 2005, 2006, 2009. and has been the Class AAA State-Runner Up in 1992, 1998, 2003, 2011, 2012, 2017*, 2018. 2017 State Championship Game Controversy vs. Calhoun High School (GA) Yellow Jackets With Peach County trailing 6-10 with 3:33 remaining on the Calhoun 21-yard line, Peach County's running back Noah Whittington caught a pass on fourth-and-8 from quarterback Antonio Gilbert at the 5-yard line. Whittington took at least two full steps and dove toward the end zone, spreading his arm with the ball across the goal line. As his arm and the ball landed in the end zone, the ball came free. The official, instead of signalling touchdown or calling the runner down, ruled the pass as incomplete. The missed scoring opportunity in a defensive game proved to be the difference as Peach County would not score on their final possession and Calhoun would win the game 10-6. The ruling of incomplete has been considered as one of the most controversial calls in GHSA state title game history, with many calling for use of instant replay in state championship games. The following spring, the GHSA added a seventh official to aid in championship games. Notable alumni *Alfred A.

The amendment also exempted any law giving effect to the article 39(b) and (c) of Directive Principles of State Policy from judicial review, even if it violated the Fundamental Rights. In 1970, the Supreme Court, in its judgement on Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union Of India, popularly known as the Bank Nationalization case, held that the Constitution guarantees the right to compensation, that is, the equivalent money of the property compulsorily acquired. The Court also held that a law which seeks to acquire or requisition property for public purposes must satisfy the requirement of Article19(1)(f). The 25th Amendment sought to overcome the restrictions imposed on the government by this ruling. Legal expert V.G. Ramachandran described the 24th and 25th Amendments as \\"not 'tinkering' with the Constitution. It is a veritable slaughter of the Constitution.\\" He stated that the 25th Amendment \\"smacks of totalitarianism and hurry to achieve socialism instantly overnight\\". Section 2(a) and 2(b), and the first part of section 3 of the 25th Amendment were upheld by the Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala in 1973 as valid. However, the second part of section 3, which prevented judicial review of any law that gives effect to Directive Principles, was declared unconstitutional. Text Background In 1970, the Supreme Court, in its judgement on Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union Of India (1970 AIR 564, 1970 SCR (3) 530), popularly known as the Bank Nationalization case, held that the Constitution guarantees the right to compensation, that is, the equivalent money of the property compulsorily acquired. The Court also held that a law which seeks to acquire or requisition property for public purposes must satisfy the requirement of Article19(1)(f). The 25th Amendment sought to overcome the restrictions imposed on the government by the Supreme Court ruling. Article 31, as it stood prior to the Amendment, specially provided that no law providing for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property which either fixes or specifies on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given, shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is inadequate. The 24th Amendment had re-established Parliament's authority to amend the Fundamental Rights in the Constitution. This cleared the way for the government to amend article 31, relating to property rights. The 25th Amendment was intended to strip the Supreme Court of the power to go into the quantum of compensation for takeover of property for public use. It would do this by amending and replacing the word \\"compensation\\" for the word \\"amount\\" for property acquired or requisitioned. The Amendment would also to insert a new clause 31(C) in the Constitution, which would prevent a bill from being challenged in the Court, either under Article 14 (equality before the law), Article 19 (right to property, freedom of association, speech, religion etc.) or Article 31 (on deprivation of law except under authority of law), if Parliament certified that the bill was intended to ensure equitable distribution of material resources or to prevent concentration of economic power. In an October 1971 report, the Law Commission, headed by former Supreme Court Chief Justice P.B. Gajendragadkar, recommended deletion of the part of article 31C which placed any law containing a declaration that it was for giving effect to certain Directive Principles, outside judicial review. The Commission stated that it would be \\"unreasonable to prevent any judicial inquiry into the question as to whether laws passed in pursuance of the policy (giving primacy to Directive Principles) bore any connection with the objects intended to be served by it. Parliament should trust the judiciary to do its duty fairly, fearlessly, impartially and objectively and to take cognizance of the changed philosophy which Parliament proposed to adopt in recognising the importance, the urgency and the significance of implementing the Directive Principles in question\\". However, the report was rejected by the government. The Law Commission's view would later be justified in 1973 by the Supreme Court verdict in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, in which the Court held the relevant section of the 25th Amendment as unconstitutional. Proposal and enactment The Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Bill, 1971 (Bill No. 106 of 1971) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 28 July 1971 by H.R. Gokhale, then Minister of Law and Justice. The Bill sought to amend article 31 and insert a new article 31C in the Constitution. The full text of the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the bill is given below: The Bill was considered by the Lok Sabha on 30 November and 1 December 1971. Speaking in the Lok Sabha on 30 November, Gokhale commended the Bill, and stated that the intention of new article 31C was to give primacy to Directive Principles and limit property rights in a manner that \\"vested interests may not be able to take shelter under Fundamental Rights and block progressive legislations\\". He also stated the judiciary would be confined to the task of legal interpretation of the Constitution, and not be called upon to \\"sit in judgment over political issues\\". Gokhale complained that there was a tendency for judges to \\"import their own political philosophies into their judgements\\" and \\"sanctify the right of property\\". He jibed that this might have been valid in the days of Gladstone, but his own country (the United Kingdom), had no value for it anymore. Gokhale further added, \\"Parliament should remain the final arbiter in determining what is adequate or can be regarded as reasonable for acquisition under a particular legislation ... Social change should not be blocked by courts by making compulsory the payment of such a quantum of compensation as to make social change impossible.\\" Then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi described the bill as \\"a small but necessary step towards the fulfillment of the goal of socialism\\". She claimed that it was not her government or party's intention to weaken the judiciary. She further stated that \\"the judiciary must not take over the power of Parliament.\\" The bill was trenchantly criticised by Piloo Mody of the Swatantra Party, who stated that India's secular and democratic Constitution was being converted into an instrument of a \\"totalitarian oligarchy devoid of the rule of law\\". Mody criticized the government for the \\"arbitrary exercise of unmitigated power\\" and the establishment of a police state. Mody further asked the ruling party whether it had made a sincere effort to bring about social and economic changes, when it had all the opportunity it needed to do so, during the past 25 years of its rule. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha (For:353 votes, Against:20), on 1 December 1971. Clause 2 of the Bill sought to amend article 31(2) of the Constitution to clarify that no law providing for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property could be called in question in any Court on the ground that the amount fixed or determined under such law to be given to the owner of the property is not adequate. During the consideration of the clause by the Lok Sabha, Gokhale moved an amendment which sought to add the following proviso at the end of the proposed clause 2 of article 31, \\"Provided that in making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority, referred to in clause (1) of article 30, the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause\\". This amendment was accepted by the House, and the clause, as amended, was adopted by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on 1 and 8 December 1971, respectively. Clauses 1 and 3 of the Bill were adopted, in the original form, by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on 1 and 8 December 1971, respectively. The Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, was considered by the Rajya Sabha on 7 and 8 December and passed on 8 December 1971. The bill received assent from then President Varahagiri Venkata Giri on 20 April 1972. It was notified in The Gazette of India, and came into force on the same day. Ratification The Act was passed in accordance with the provisions of Article 368 of the Constitution, and was ratified by more than half of the State Legislatures, as required under Clause (2) of the said article. The only states that did not ratify the amendment were Manipur and Rajasthan. State Legislatures that ratified the amendment are listed below: # Andhra Pradesh # Assam # Bihar # Gujarat # Haryana # Himachal Pradesh # Jammu and Kashmir # Kerala # Madhya Pradesh # Maharashtra # Meghalaya # Mysore # Nagaland # Orissa # Punjab # Tamil Nadu # Tripura # Uttar Pradesh # West Bengal Reception Legal expert V.G. Ramachandran, writing in the Supreme Court Cases Journal (cite: (1971) 2 SCC (Jour) 11) in 1971, stated that the 24th and 25th Amendments were not \\"tinkering\\" with the Constitution, but \\"a veritable slaughter of the Constitution\\". He felt that the 25th Amendment \\"smacks of totalitarianism and hurry to achieve socialism instantly overnight\\". Ramamchandran further stated that the amendments lowered the prestige of the legislature as well as the Judiciary. Supporting the Fundamental Rights, Ramamchandran wrote, \\"When our founding fathers forged this Constitution they were well aware of the social and economic urges in the country. But they were anxious that the progress must be gradual and stable and not revolutionary. That is why they envisaged the rights to be fundamental in Part III subject to reasonable restrictions in public interest. They further enunciated in Part IV the Directive Principles of State Policy which may be translated into reasonable restrictions of the rights in Part III by law from time as conditions justified them. Changes made overnight during national poverty only increase poverty when there is no corresponding effort at production and increase of wealth. It is equally true that social and economic conditions cannot be improved merely by legislation. It would appear that the people who looked for a Utopia are being fed by a spate of legislation conferring legislative Power. For whose benefit is this? Is it for the political party in power or for the people?\\" Ramamchandran argued that making Parliament supreme would not ease the difficulties of the people, and that what really mattered to the common man was how Parliament would protect him in the matter of and safeguarding his Fundamental Rights. He further questioned the Congress government's claim that Parliament had unlimited power to amend the Constitution, asking, \\"where was this 'Constituent Power' when Article 368 was originally framed? If it did not reside in Parliament then, how can it come in now; if it had that power even then in 1948-50, how was it that Article 368 did not expressly say so?\\" Ramachandran believed that even if the amendments were upheld by the court, it would not be justifiable to call the present Constitution as amended by the 24th and 25th Amendments as the Constitution of India, and it should instead be called \\"The Government of India Act, 1971\\". Aftermath The 25th Amendment was part of a series of measures taken by Indira Gandhi to increase her power, and establish one-party rule, beginning with the enactment of the 24th Amendment on 5 November 1971. The 25th Amendment was followed by several constitutional amendments designed to weaken the judiciary, and enhance the authority of Parliament and the Prime Minister's Office. The most notable among these were the 38th and 39th Amendments, culminating in the 42nd Amendment in 1976 during The Emergency, which brought about the most sweeping changes to the Constitution in its history. Kesavananda Bharati case The Supreme Court reviewed its decision in Golaknath v. State of Punjab, in 1971 in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, and considered the validity of the 24th, 25th, 26th and 29th Amendments. The case was heard by the largest ever Constitutional Bench of 13 Judges. The Bench gave eleven judgements, which agreed on some points and differed on others. The Court held, by a margin of 7-6, that although no part of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, was beyond the amending power of Parliament (thus overruling the 1967 case), the \\"basic structure of the Constitution could not be abrogated even by a constitutional amendment\\". The Court upheld Section 2(a) and 2(b), and the first part of section 3 of the 25th Amendment as valid. However, the second part namely \\"and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy\\" was declared unconstitutional. The government of Indira Gandhi did not take kindly to this implied restriction on its powers by the court. On 26 April 1973, Justice Ajit Nath Ray, who was among the dissenters, was promoted to Chief Justice of India superseding three senior Judges, Shelat, Grover and Hegde, which was unprecedented in Indian legal history. Advocate C.K. Daphtary termed the incident as \\"the blackest day in the history of democracy\\". Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah (previous Chief Justice of India) remarked that \\"this was an attempt of not creating 'forward looking judges' but 'judges looking forward' to the office of Chief Justice\\". The government enacted the 42nd Amendment in 1976, to abrogate the Kesavananda Bharati ruling.

Clinics charged patients between $10,000 and $28,000 for the complete package, including fertilization, the surrogate's fee, and delivery of the baby at a hospital. Including the costs of flight tickets, medical procedures and hotels, this represented roughly a third of the price of the procedure in the UK and a fifth of that in the US.Kannan, Shilpa. \\"Regulators Eye India's Surrogacy Sector\\" . India Business Report, BBC World. Retrieved March 23, 2009.See:  Surrogate mothers received medical, nutritional and overall health care through surrogacy agreements. In 2005, the government approved the 2002 draft of the National Guidelines for the Accreditation, Supervision and Regulation of ART Clinics in India, in 2002. Before commercial surrogacy was banned in 2015, India was a popular destination for surrogacy. The economic scale of surrogacy in India is unknown, but study backed by the United Nations in July 2012 estimated the business at more than $400 million a year, with over 3,000 fertility clinics across India. In 2013, surrogacy by foreign homosexual couples and single parents was banned. In 2015, the government banned commercial surrogacy in India and permitted entry of embryos only for research purposes. Shortly thereafter in 2016, a Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill was introduced and passed by Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, proposing to permit only heterosexual Indian couples married for at least five years with infertility problems to access altruistic or unpaid surrogacy and thereby further banning commercial surrogacy. The 2016 bill lapsed owing to the adjournment sine die of the parliament session. The bill was reintroduced and passed by the Lok Sabha in 2019. The bill would require to be passed by the Rajya Sabha, upper house of the Indian parliament and presidential assent before it becomes an act and thereby a law. Judicial pronouncements Baby Manji Yamada v. Union of India (2008) In 2008, a baby (Manji Yamada) born through surrogacy was unable to leave India for three months after her birth because she held neither Indian nor Japanese nationality. The case came before the Supreme Court of India. The issue was resolved after the Japanese government issued a one-year visa to her on humanitarian grounds. The Japanese government issued the visa after the Indian government granted the baby a travel certificate in September 2008 in line with a Supreme Court direction. Jan Balaz v. Anand Municipality and ors. (2009) In 2009 in Jan Balaz v. Anand Municipality and ors., the Gujarat High Court conferred Indian citizenship on two twin babies fathered through compensated surrogacy by a German national in Anand district. The court observed: \\"We are primarily concerned with the rights of two newborn, innocent babies, much more than the rights of the biological parents, surrogate mother, or the donor of the ova. Emotional and legal relationship of the babies with the surrogate mother and the donor of the ova is also of vital importance.\\" The court considered the surrogacy laws of countries like Ukraine, Japan, and the United States. Because India does not offer dual citizenship, the children will have to convert to Overseas Citizenship of India if they also hold non-Indian citizenship.See: A not for profit public private initiative of The Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), was launched on 28 May 2007. Balaz, the petitioner, submitted before the Supreme Court that he shall be submitting his passports before the Indian Consulate in Berlin. He also agreed that a NGO in Germany shall respond back to India on the status of the children and their welfare. The Union of India responded that India shall make all attempts to have the children sent to Germany. German authorities have also agreed to reconsider the case if approached by the Indian. In May 2010, the Balaz twins were provided the exit and entry documents that allowed them to leave India for Germany. The parents agreed to adopt them in Germany according to German rules. Pdf.  Surrogacy risk and conditions in India  According to The Guardian, a surrogate mother died because she didn't get the proper medical attention. Conservative estimates show that more than 25,000 children are now being born through surrogates in India every year in an industry worth $2 billion. Domestic demand is increasing, but as fertility levels drop elsewhere, at least 50% of these are \\"commissioned\\" by overseas, mainly western, couples. Most of the industry is operating unchecked. India's medical research watchdog drafted regulations more than two years ago, yet they still await presentation in parliament, leaving the surrogates and baby factories open to abuse. According to Dr. Manish Banker, from the Pulse Women's Hospital and Dr. Yugal Kishore Upadhyay from IAS Medicare reported to come back on a patient, \\"She suddenly had a convulsion and fell on the floor,\\" he said. \\"We immediately took her for treatment. Since she was showing signs of distress, we conducted an emergency cesarean section delivery.\\" Indian Council for Medical Research guidelines The Indian Council for Medical Research has given guidelines in the year 2002, approved by the government in 2005, regulating Assisted Reproductive Technology procedures. The Law Commission of India submitted the 228th report on Assisted Reproductive Technology procedures discussing the importance and need for surrogacy, and also the steps taken to control surrogacy arrangements. The following observations had been made by the Law Commission: *Surrogacy arrangement will continue to be governed by contract amongst parties, which will contain all the terms requiring consent of surrogate mother to bear child, agreement of her husband and other family members for the same, medical procedures of artificial insemination, reimbursement of all reasonable expenses for carrying child to full term, willingness to hand over the child born to the commissioning parent(s), etc. But such an arrangement should not be for commercial purposes. *A surrogacy arrangement should provide for financial support for surrogate child in the event of death of the commissioning couple or individual before delivery of the child, or divorce between the intended parents and subsequent willingness of none to take delivery of the child. *A surrogacy contract should necessarily take care of life insurance cover for surrogate mother. *One of the intended parents should be a donor as well, because the bond of love and affection with a child primarily emanates from biological relationship. Also, the chances of various kinds of child-abuse, which have been noticed in cases of adoptions, will be reduced. In case the intended parent is single, he or she should be a donor to be able to have a surrogate child. Otherwise, adoption is the way to have a child which is resorted to if biological (natural) parents and adoptive parents are different. *Legislation itself should recognize a surrogate child to be the legitimate child of the commissioning parent(s) without there being any need for adoption or even declaration of guardian. *The birth certificate of the surrogate child should contain the name(s) of the commissioning parent(s) only. *Right to privacy of donor as well as surrogate mother should be protected. *Sex-selective surrogacy should be prohibited. *Cases of abortion should be governed by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971 only. Proposed legislations Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, 2013 The Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, 2013 has been pending for quite a while and it has not been presented in the Indian Parliament. It will not allow commercial surrogacy that involves exchange of money for anything other than paying for medical expenses for the mother and the child. The bill would prohibit these from surrogacy: couples already having one child, foreigners or Overseas Citizens of India (OCI), holders as well as live-in-Partners, single people, homosexuals and widows. There has been significant criticism of the bill. Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016 and 2019 In 2016, a Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill was introduced and passed by Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, proposing to permit only Indian heterosexual couples married for at least five years with infertility problems to access altruistic or unpaid surrogacy and thereby banning commercial surrogacy.

The house is located between the A1 road and the East Coast Main Line railway at . Pre-Reformation In the 12th century, the monks of Newbattle Abbey were granted lands at Prestongrange, to the west of Prestonpans, by Robert de Quincy. Their main purpose at Prestongrange, apart from prayers and solace, was the panning of salt on the southern shores of the Firth of Forth. To heat the salt pans they used wood at first, but then found a plentiful supply of fuel in the rich coalfields of East Lothian. The monks used specific routes between Newbattle and the mother house at Melrose Abbey as well as a route between Prestongrange and Newbattle which would pass the Abbot's dwellings at Inveresk. Those roads became known as the Salter's Roads. There appears to be clear evidence that another route led past what is now Bankton, and on that route the monks' procession would stop. At the site of the stop an establishment was erected which became known as \\"Holy Stop\\", later known as Oliestob. Following the Scottish Reformation in 1560 when the lands of Bankton passed to Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle.  Secular history  Alexander Seton, 1st Viscount of Kingston, writing as early as 1687, relates that his grandfather, Robert, 1st Earl of Winton, provided the lands of \\"Hollistobe, vulgo Olivestob\\" to Alexander's uncle, Sir Thomas Seton, the earl's fourth son. The 1st Earl of Winton died in 1603, and therefore the Setons must have owned Olivestob before 1603. Anonymous. Drawing of the house after 1745. Four lines on the left side relate to colonel Gardiner's death. Gardiner Monument erected in 1853 by Alexander Ritchie from public subscription Sir John Hamilton, a descendant of the Hamiltons of Boreland, bought Olivestob from Sir John Seton in 1624 and, on his death, left the house to his son William. In 1674, Captain Thomas Hamilton, younger brother of William, bought the estates. Later that year Thomas married Grizell Hamilton of Westport. Grizell's grandfather owned the nearby estate at Preston and was the brother of Thomas Hamilton, 1st Earl of Haddington. Captain Hamilton was previously in service in Sweden but on his return to Edinburgh as a merchant was promoted to Colonel in the Edinburgh Regiment. Colonel Hamilton's son James studied law at Leiden in Holland and was admitted as an advocate in 1708. He was later appointed Sheriff of Haddington by Queen Anne, a position he held until 1715. James Hamilton suffered serious debt problems and was forced to sell the estate in 1733 to Colonel James Gardiner, a distinguished army officer. Some confusion arises when the name was changed to Bankton but, according to Doddridge, Colonel Gardiner called his new home Bankton since he had received several letters from the officer addressed as Bankton. Colonel Gardiner was mortally wounded at the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745, within sight of his own home. He was leading a rear guard action of British troops against the Highland rebels of Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) when he was cut down. He died later that day at the manse of Tranent Parish Church less than a mile away. William Millar, 1758) Following the death of Colonel Gardiner, the house was purchased by Andrew McDouall, an eminent Edinburgh advocate. Ten years later, in 1755, McDouall was elevated to the bench of the High Courts of Scotland, and assumed the name of Lord Bankton. On McDouall's death, he bequeathed money for the poor of Prestonpans. The house remained in the McDouall family into the 20th century, and a farm was administered from the house by tenants. A colliery was sunk just to the west of the house. In 1852, fire destroyed Bankton House.Prestonpans and Vicinity, Ecclesiastical and Traditional by P. McNeil (1902) The house was restored, only to meet the same fate in 1966. It was a category A listed building before the 1966 fire and, in 1971, was described as a \\"non impressive ruin\\".  Restoration  Between 1988 and 1995, the house was given a new lease of life when the Lothian Building Preservation Trust undertook to re- build the ruins and renew the house. The initiative was funded by grants from Historic Scotland, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage. The house is now divided into separate apartments. The two pavilions still stand at either side of the garden. The west pavilion, a former doocot (dovecot), now contains an exhibition on the restoration, and a history of the house.

The band consists of Chuck Cleaver (vocals/guitar), Lisa Walker (vocals/guitar), John Erhardt (pedal steel), Joe Klug (drums) and Mark Messerly (bass). Cleaver and Walker write most of the songs and either alternate lead vocals or sing them in harmony. Live performances feature the two vocalists having a \\"combative rapport\\". They have released six albums, one live album, two EPs, one mini LP and a number of singles. The group has received critical acclaim from Rolling Stone, Robert Christgau, Chicago, and SPIN. History Wussy formed in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2001 while Chuck Cleaver had just released the last album with his previous group, Ass Ponys. He met Lisa Walker and asked her to perform with him at a local awards show in Cincinnati in 2001. Following the performance the duo decided to form a band together. Walker is originally from Muncie, Indiana, who attended Cedarville University and has worked in marketing. They were joined by Messerly on bass and Dawn Burman on drums in 2002. Burman had not yet mastered the instrument but joined as \\"I loved their sound and wanted to be part of it\\". Cleaver finalised his previous band with a compilation in 2005 leaving him to concentrate on Wussy. They made their recording debut in 2005 with the album Funeral Dress on Shake it Records, the label of a local record store of the same name. The record was produced by John Curley at his Ultrasuede Studios, where the band would continue to record future albums. While making the album all four band members suffered some personal hardship that inspired much of the 2007 record Left for Dead. Contrary to other releases it relied heavily on Walker's writing, and was described by Spin as doing \\"relationship songs right\\". It was followed by a self-titled album in 2009. The same year drummer Burman left and was replaced by Joe Klug. In late 2010, the band recorded an acoustic version of their debut as Funeral Dress II live at Ultrasuede that was released for Record Store Day 2011. The album Strawberry was released in November 2011 and was described as \\"driven by an unpretentious, rust-flecked honesty and a warped worldview\\". Former Ass Ponys member John Erhardt joined the band before recording started. The band embarked on a three-week headlining tour in support of the album. In 2012 they released the Europe-only seventeen track compilation Buckeye on Damnably Records, their first international release. In 2014 they released the album Attica!, the title inspired by the film Dog Day Afternoon, while the single and The Who tribute \\"Teenage Wasteland\\", received some airplay. The album was released in the UK through Damnably Records. In March 2016 the band released their seventh album, Forever Sounds, which reached number 20 on the Billboard Heatseeker album chart. The band's eighth album, What Heaven is Like, was released in May 2018. At the beginning of the band Cleaver and Walker were a couple but they separated in 2007. On the band's name, Wussy: Cleaver joked that \\"I think it looks good on a t-shirt.\\" Pedal steel guitarist John Erhardt died on May 4, 2020.  Critical acclaim  The band is a favorite with some rock critics. In 2012 Robert Christgau wrote that \\"Wussy have been the best since they released the first of their five superb albums in 2005\\", and he has called them his \\"favorite band\\". Two albums later, Charles Taylor said the impact of Wussy's poetic lyrics and evocative sounds \\"brings you immediately back to the way we received rock and roll as solitary adolescents, as if the songs were radio transmissions from a resistance we hadn't dared to hope existed.\\" Members * Chuck Cleaver ‚Äì Vocals, Guitar * Lisa Walker ‚Äì Vocals, Guitar * Mark Messerly ‚Äì Bass, Keys * John Erhardt ‚Äì Pedal Steel, Guitar (died May 2020) * Joe Klug ‚Äì Drums Discography Albums * 2005: Funeral Dress (Shake It) * 2007: Left for Dead (Shake It) * 2009: Wussy (Shake It) * 2011: Strawberry (Shake It) * 2014: Attica!

Early life and education Harry Maxwell Mays was born August 13, 1918 in Providence, Rhode Island to W. Clarke S. Mays Sr and Alice Hill Mays. He was one of three children; he had a brother, W. Clarke S. Mays, Jr., and a sister, Alice Mays Gray. The family was well-to-do, as his father had invented the metal pen clip that was the mainstay of the family business, the Mays Manufacturing Co. As a child, Mays attended Saturday morning art classes at the Rhode Island School of Design. Later, he attended RISD, graduating in 1941. Career After serving in a map-making unit in Brazil during World War II, Mays returned to Providence, where he began exhibiting his work at local galleries. His first one-man commercial show was at the Ferargil Gallery in New York in 1948. In the ensuing years he became notable for a number of highly successful art shows and magazine covers, including Yankee Magazine, featuring traditional New England scenes, and was a highly sought-after speaker and storyteller. As a successful businessman, he was treasurer of Mays Manufacturing Company, a family business until its sale in the mid-1980s. He was Past President and Director Emeritus of the Providence Art Club where the main gallery is named in his honor. He led the drive for a major restoration of the historic property in the late 1970s.

It can be used both to aid in a decision at the table and to derive the entire suit division probability table. At the beginning of a deal, each of four hands comprises thirteen cards and one may say there are thirteen vacant places in each hand. The probability that a particular card lies in a particular hand is one-quarter, or 13/52, the proportion of vacant places in that hand. From the perspective of a player who sees one hand, the probable lie of a missing card in a particular one of the other hands is one-third. The principle of vacant places is a rule for updating those uniform probabilities as one learns about the deal during the auction and the play. Essentially, as the lies of some cards become known - especially as the entire distributions of some suits become known - the odds on location of any other particular card remain proportional to the dwindling numbers of unidentified cards in all hands, i.e. to the numbers of so-called vacant places. The principle of vacant places follows from Conditional Probability theory, which is based on Bayes Theorem. For a good background to bridge probabilities, and vacant places in particular, see Kelsey; see also the Official Encyclopedia of Bridge\\"Mathematical Tables\\" (Table 4). How Vacant Places calculations work at the table We are the declarer in a heart contract with trump suit combination Kxxx in dummy and AJxxx in hand (see figure). There are four heart cards missing, the queen and three spot cards or Qxxx. We play small to the king as both opponents follow low and lead another small heart, 2. The last of the three spot cards appears on our right leaving one outstanding heart, the queen. Because no one would play the queen while holding a spot card too, we have learned nothing about the location of the queen directly, only the distribution of the three spot cards, one at left and two at right. At the moment of decision we can perform a vacant places calculation. First, suppose we know nothing about the other suits, probably because the opponents did not bid. Then we know only the one small heart observed at left and the two observed at right. That leaves twelve \\"vacant places\\" where Q may reside at left and eleven vacant places at right. If the queen lies in 12 of the 23 vacant places, at left, we win by playing the ace; the queen drops. In 11 of the 23 vacant places, we win by playing the jack and then the ace, dropping the queen at right on the next heart trick. Thus the odds in favor of playing the ace are 12 to 11; the ace is a slight favorite to win an extra trick, i.e. to win five tricks in hearts. The proportion 12/23 = 52.174% is exactly the probability that appears in standard catalogs of suit combinations. Note, however, that this calculation is only available in the heart suit because we have accounted for all the other hearts, that is to say every heart but the one we are still seeking. If we were missing a total of five heart cards, then a vacant places calculation could not be applied. Alternatively, suppose that LHO dealt and opened 2 (weak); we reached a heart contract without further bidding by the opponents; and we have five spades between dummy and hand leaving eight for the opponents. We may infer that LHO has six spades and RHO two. (This is not certain; occasionally the spades lie seven and one or five and three. If six and two, that leaves seven and eleven vacant places for the other three suits.) The heart suit combination and play are as discussed above: the combination in the figure; we lead small to the king while both opponents follow low, and lead 2 back toward hand while RHO follows low. Now there are six vacant places for Q at left and nine vacant places at right. The odds are now 6 to 9 against the queen at left, and against winning if we play the ace. The proportion 9/15 = 60% is the probability that RHO holds the queen and playing the jack will win the suit. How Vacant Places calculations work away from the table Let us imagine that we are required to build up a set of probability tables to help show how a suit might be splitting, for example, the Probability of suit distributions in two hidden hands on the page Bridge probabilities. Let's suppose that we are missing three cards in the suit and we know nothing about the distribution of other suits (i.e. we are looking for the a priori probabilities). When we \\"deal\\" out the first card of the three, we can put it in either hand. Each hand, by definition, has 13 vacant places, so it is a toss-up which hand it goes into (13/26 = 50% for either hand). Now let us suppose that we want to know the probability of the suit being divided 3-0\\\\. The first card is already in, let's say, the East hand. Now he has only 12 vacant places so the probability of that hand getting the second of the three cards is 12/(12 + 13). This must be multiplied by the initial 1/2 probability to find the probability of East having both of the first two cards. Now let's deal out the third (and last) of the missing cards. By this time, East has only 11 vacant places, while West still has 13. The probability of East getting all three of the missing cards is 1/2 √ó 12/25 √ó 11/24 which is exactly 0.11, which is the value that we see in the fourth row of the table (3 - 0 : 0.22 : 2 : 0.11). Now, let's calculate the individual probability of a 2‚Äì2 split when missing four cards (the following row in the table). This time, proceeding similarly to before, the calculation is: 13/26 √ó 12/25 √ó 13/24 √ó 12/23 = (3 √ó 13) / (23 √ó 25) = 0.067826. This amount has to be multiplied by 6, exactly the ways the 2‚Äì2 distribution can show up, the combination of getting 2 cards over 4. The final probability of a 2‚Äì2 split is then 0.067826 * 6 = 0.4069565217 The probabilities of other suit divisions can be calculated similarly.

They left in 1815 in a caravan, making their way to the port of Bushehr and from there boarded a ship to Basra in southern Iraq. From there, they traveled by land to Baghdad and Damascus.

They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as those running CP/M or the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporary business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. Home computers were usually not electronic kits; home computers were sold already manufactured in stylish metal or plastic enclosures. There were, however, commercial kits like the Sinclair ZX80 which were both home and home- built computers since the purchaser could assemble the unit from a kit. Advertisements in the popular press for early home computers were rife with possibilities for their practical use in the home, from cataloging recipes to personal finance to home automation,Video of old TV Ad for Atari Home computers from YouTube but these were seldom realized in practice. For example, using a typical 1980s home computer as a home automation appliance would require the computer to be kept powered on at all times and dedicated to this task. Personal finance and database use required tedious data entry. By contrast, advertisements in the specialty computer press often simply listed specifications, assuming a knowledgable user who already had applications in mind. If no packaged software was available for a particular application, the home computer user could program one‚Äîprovided they had invested the requisite hours to learn computer programming, as well as the idiosyncrasies of their system. Since most systems shipped with the BASIC programming language included on the system ROM, it was easy for users to get started creating their own simple applications. Many users found programming to be a fun and rewarding experience, and an excellent introduction to the world of digital technology. The line between 'business' and 'home' computer market segments vanished completely once IBM PC compatibles became commonly used in the home, since now both categories of computers typically use the same processor architectures, peripherals, operating systems, and applications. Often the only difference may be the sales outlet through which they are purchased. Another change from the home computer era is that the once-common endeavour of writing one's own software programs has almost vanished from home computer use. Background Computer at home, USA 1965 As early as 1965, some experimental projects, such as Jim Sutherland's ECHO IV, explored the possible utility of a computer in the home. In 1969, the Honeywell Kitchen Computer was marketed as a luxury gift item, and would have inaugurated the era of home computing, but none was sold.http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/2/163.full.pdf Paul Atkinson, The Curious Case of the Kitchen Computer: Products and Non-Products in Design History, from Journal of Design History, Vol. 23 No.2 Computers became affordable for the general public in the 1970s due to the mass production of the microprocessor starting in 1971. Early microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 had front-mounted switches and diagnostic lights (nicknamed \\"blinkenlights\\") to control and indicate internal system status, and were often sold in kit form to hobbyists. These kits would contain an empty printed circuit board which the buyer would fill with the integrated circuits, other individual electronic components, wires and connectors, and then hand-solder all the connections. While two early home computers (Sinclair ZX80 and Acorn Atom) could be bought either in kit form or assembled, most home computers were only sold pre-assembled. They were enclosed in plastic or metal cases similar in appearance to typewriter or hi-fi equipment enclosures, which were more familiar and attractive to consumers than the industrial metal card-cage enclosures used by the Altair and similar computers. The keyboard - a feature lacking on the Altair - was usually built into the same case as the motherboard. Ports for plug-in peripheral devices such as a video display, cassette tape recorders, joysticks, and (later) disk drives were either built- in or available on expansion cards. Although the Apple II series had internal expansion slots, most other home computer models' expansion arrangements were through externally accessible 'expansion ports' that also served as a place to plug in cartridge-based games. Usually the manufacturer would sell peripheral devices designed to be compatible with their computers as extra cost accessories. Peripherals and software were not often interchangeable between different brands of home computer, or even between successive models of the same brand. To save the cost of a dedicated monitor, the home computer would often connect through an RF modulator to the family TV set, which served as both video display and sound system.Texas Instruments TI-99/4 computer: At the start, the TI99/4 could not offer an RF-modulator certified by United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and had to use an expensive modified TV instead By 1982, an estimated 621,000 home computers were in American households, at an average sales price of US$530 (). After the success of the Radio Shack TRS-80, the Commodore PET and the Apple II in 1977, almost every manufacturer of consumer electronics rushed to introduce a home computer. Large numbers of new machines of all types began to appear during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mattel, Coleco, Texas Instruments and Timex, none of which had any prior connection to the computer industry, all had short-lived home computer lines in the early 1980s. Some home computers were more successful - the BBC Micro, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Atari 800XL and Commodore 64 sold many units over several years and attracted third-party software development. Almost universally, home computers had a BASIC interpreter combined with a line editor in permanent read-only memory which one could use to type in BASIC programs and execute them immediately or save them to tape or disk. In direct mode, the BASIC interpreter was also used as the user interface, and given tasks such as loading, saving, managing, and running files. One exception was the Jupiter Ace, which had a Forth interpreter instead of BASIC. A built-in programming language was seen as a requirement for any computer of the era, and was the main feature setting home computers apart from video game consoles. Still, home computers competed in the same market as the consoles. A home computer was often seen as simply as a higher end purchase than a console, adding abilities and productivity potential to what would still be mainly a gaming device. A common marketing tactic was to show a computer system and console playing games side by side, then emphasizing the computer's greater ability by showing it running user-created programs, education software, word processing, spreadsheet and other applications while the game console showed a blank screen or continued playing the same repetitive game. Another capability home computers had that game consoles of the time lacked was the ability to access remote services over telephone lines by adding a serial port interface, a modem, and communication software. Though it could be costly, it permitted the computer user to access services like Compuserve and private or corporate bulletin board systems to post or read messages, or to download or upload software. Some enthusiasts with computers equipped with large storage capacity and a dedicated phone line operated bulletin boards of their own. This capability anticipated the internet by nearly twenty years. Some game consoles offered \\"programming packs\\" consisting of a version of BASIC in a ROM cartridge. Atari's BASIC Programming for the Atari 2600 was one of these. For the ColecoVision console, Coleco even announced an expansion module which would convert it into a full- fledged computer system. The Magnavox Odyssey¬≤ game console had a built-in keyboard to support its C7420 Home Computer Module. Books of type-in program listings like BASIC Computer Games were available dedicated for the BASICs of most models of computer with titles along the lines of 64 Amazing BASIC Games for the Commodore 64. While most of the programs in these books were short and simple games or demos, some titles such as Compute!s SpeedScript series, contained productivity software that rivaled commercial packages. To avoid the tedious process of typing in a program listing from a book, these books would sometimes include a mail-in offer from the author to obtain the programs on disk or cassette for a few dollars. Before the Internet, and before most computer owners had a modem, books were a popular and low-cost means of software distribution--one that had the advantage of incorporating its own documentation. These books also served a role in familiarizing new computer owners with the concepts of programming; some titles added suggested modifications to the program listings for the user to carry out. Applying a patch to modify software to be compatible with one's system or writing a utility program to fit one's needs was a skill every advanced computer owner was expected to have. During the peak years of the home computer market, scores of models were produced, usually as individual design projects with little or no thought given to compatibility between different manufacturers or even within product lines of the same manufacturer. Except for the Japanese MSX standard, the concept of a computer platform was still forming, with most companies considering rudimentary BASIC language and disk format compatibility sufficient to claim a model as \\"compatible\\". Things were different in the business world, where cost-conscious small business owners had been using CP/M running on Z80 based computers from Osborne, Kaypro, Morrow Designs and a host of other manufacturers. For many of these businesses, the development of the microcomputer made computing and business software affordable where they had not been before. Introduced in August 1981, the IBM Personal Computer would eventually supplant CP/M as the standard platform used in business. This was largely due to the IBM name and the system's 16 bit open architecture, which expanded maximum memory tenfold, and also encouraged production of third-party clones. In the late 1970s, the 6502-based Apple II series had carved out a niche for itself in business, thanks to the industry's first killer app, VisiCalc, released in 1979. However the Apple II would quickly be displaced for office use by IBM PC compatibles running Lotus 1-2-3. Apple Computer's 1980 Apple III was underwhelming, and although the 1984 release of the Apple Macintosh introduced the modern GUI to the market, it wasn't common until IBM- compatible computers adopted it. Throughout the 1980s, businesses large and small adopted the PC platform, leading, by the end of the decade, to sub- US$1000 IBM PC XT-class white box machines, usually built in Asia and sold by US companies like PCs Limited. In 1980 Wayne Green, the publisher of Kilobaud Microcomputing, recommended that companies avoid the term \\"home computer\\" in their advertising as \\"I feel is self-limiting for sales ... I prefer the term \\"microcomputers\\" since it doesn't limit the uses of the equipment in the imagination of the prospective customers\\". With the exception of Tandy, most computer companies ‚Äì even those with a majority of sales to home users ‚Äì agreed, avoiding the term \\"home computer\\" because of its association with the image of, as Compute! wrote, \\"a low-powered, low-end machine primarily suited for playing games\\". Apple consistently avoided stating that it was a home- computer company, and described the IIc as \\"a serious computer for the serious home user\\" despite competing against IBM's PCjr home computer. John Sculley denied that his company sold home computers; rather, he said, Apple sold \\"computers for use in the home\\". In 1990 the company reportedly refused to support joysticks on its low-cost Macintosh LC and IIsi computers to prevent customers from considering them as \\"game machines\\". Although the Apple II and Atari computers are functionally similar, Atari's home-oriented marketing resulted in a game-heavy library with much less business software. By the late 1980s, many mass merchants sold video game consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System, but no longer sold home computers. Toward the end of the 1980s, clones also became popular with non-corporate customers. Inexpensive, highly compatible clones succeeded where the PCjr had failed. Replacing the hobbyists who had made up the majority of the home computer market were, as Compute! described them, \\"people who want to take work home from the office now and then, play a game now and then, learn more about computers, and help educate their children\\". By 1986 industry experts predicted an \\"MS-DOS Christmas\\", and the magazine stated that clones threatened Commodore, Atari, and Apple's domination of the home-computer market. The declining cost of IBM compatibles on the one hand, and the greatly increased graphics, sound, and storage abilities of fourth generation video game consoles such as the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System on the other, combined to cause the market segment for home computers to vanish by the early 1990s in the US. In Europe, the home computer remained a distinct presence for a few years more, with the low-end models of the 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST families being the dominant players, but by the mid-1990s even the European market had dwindled. The Dutch government even ran a program that allowed businesses to sell computers tax-free to its employees, often accompanied by home training programs. Naturally, these businesses chose to equip their employees with the same systems they themselves were using. Today a computer bought for home use anywhere will be very similar to those used in offices ‚Äì made by the same manufacturers, with compatible peripherals, operating systems, and application software. Technology A Commodore 64 system, showing the basic layout of a typical home computer system of the era. Pictured are the CPU/keyboard unit, floppy disk drive, and dedicated color monitor. Many systems also had a dot matrix printer for producing paper output. Eastern Bloc computers were often significantly different in appearance from western computers. Pictured is a KC 85/3 with its keyboard placed on top, by VEB Mikroelektronik M√ºhlhausen released in 1986 and based on an East German Zilog Z80 clone. Soviet Electronika BK0010.01 home computer was based on the –ö1801–í–ú1 (Soviet LSI-11-compatible CPU) and was, basically, a very stripped-down PDP-11. Many home computers were superficially similar. Most had a keyboard integrated into the same case as the motherboard, or, more frequently, a mainboard‚Äîwhile the expandable home computers appeared from the very start (the Apple II offered as many as seven expansion slots), as the whole segment was generally aimed downmarket, few offers were priced or positioned high enough to allow for such expandability. Some systems have only one expansion port, often realized in the form of cumbersome \\"sidecar\\" system, such as on the TI-99/4, or required finicky and unwieldy ribbon cables to connect the expansion modules. Sometimes they were equipped with a cheap membrane or chiclet keyboard in the early days, although full-travel keyboards quickly became universal due to overwhelming consumer preference. Most systems could use an RF modulator to display 20‚Äì40 column text output on a home television. Indeed, the use of a television set as a display almost defines the pre-PC home computer. Although dedicated composite or \\"green screen\\" computer displays were available for this market segment and offered a sharper display, a monitor was often a later purchase made only after users had bought a floppy disk drive, printer, modem, and the other pieces of a full system. The reason for this was that while those TV-monitors had difficulty displaying the clear and readable 80-column text that became the industry standard at the time, the only consumers who really needed that were the power users utilizing the machine for business purposes, while the average casual consumer would use the system for games only and was content with the lower resolution for which a TV worked fine. An important exception was the Radio Shack TRS-80, the first mass-marketed computer for home use, which included its own 64-column display monitor and full-travel keyboard as standard features. This \\"peripherals sold separately\\" approach is another defining characteristic of the home computer era. A first time computer buyer who brought a base C-64 system home and hooked it up to their TV would find they needed to buy a disk drive (the Commodore 1541 was the only fully compatible model) or Datasette before they could make use of it as anything but a game machine or TV Typewriter. In the early part of the 1980s, the dominant microprocessors used in home computers were the 8-bit MOS Technology 6502 (Apple, Commodore, Atari, BBC Micro) and Zilog Z80 (TRS-80, ZX81, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 128, Amstrad CPC). One exception was the TI-99 series, announced in 1979 with a 16-bit TMS9900 CPU.The TI99/4 was unique in using a 16 bit processor from Retrogaming Times, Issue 42, February 20, 2001 The TI was originally to use the 8-bit 9985 processor designed especially for it, but this project was cancelled. However, the glue logic needed to retrofit the 16-bit CPU to an 8-bit 9985 system negated the advantages of the more powerful CPU. Another exception was the Soviet Elektronika BK series of 1984, which used the fully 16-bit and powerful for the time 1801 series CPU, offering a full PDP-11 compatibility and a fully functional Q-Bus slot, though at the cost of very anemic RAM and graphics. The Motorola 6809 was used by the Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer, the Fujitsu FM-7, and Dragon 32/64. Processor clock rates were typically 1‚Äì2 MHz for 6502 and 6809 based CPU's and 2‚Äì4 MHz for Z80 based systems (yielding roughly equal performance), but this aspect was not emphasized by users or manufacturers, as the systems' limited RAM capacity, graphics abilities and storage options had a more perceivable effect on performance than CPU speed. For low-price computers the cost of RAM memory chips contributed greatly to the final product price to the consumer, and fast CPUs demanded expensive, fast memory. So designers kept clock rates only adequate; in some cases like the Atari and Commodore 8-bit machines, coprocessors were added to speed processing of graphics and audio data. For these computers clock rate was considered a technical detail of interest only to users needing accurate timing for their own programs. To economize on component cost, often the same crystal used to produce color television compatible signals was also divided down and used for the processor clock. This meant processors rarely operated at their full rated speed, and had the side-effect that European and North American versions of the same home computer operated at slightly different speeds and different video resolution due to different television standards. Initially, many home computers used the then-ubiquitous compact audio cassette as a storage mechanism. A rough analogy to how this worked would be to place a recorder on the phone line as a file was uploaded by modem to \\"save\\" it, and playing the recording back through the modem to \\"load\\". Most cassette implementations were notoriously slow and unreliable, but 8\\" drives were too bulky for home use, and early 5.25\\" form factor drives were priced for business use, out of reach of most home buyers. An innovative alternative was the Exatron Stringy Floppy, a continuous loop tape drive which was much faster than a datacassette drive and could perform much like a floppy disk drive. It was available for the TRS-80 and some others. A closely related technology was the ZX Microdrive developed by Sinclair Research in the UK for their ZX Spectrum and QL home computers. Eventually mass production of 5.25\\" drives resulted in lower prices, and after about 1984 they pushed cassette drives out of the US home computer market. 5.25\\" floppy disk drives would remain standard until the end of the 8-bit era. Though external 3.5\\" drives were made available for home computer systems toward the latter part of the 1980s, almost all software sold for 8-bit home computers remained on 5.25\\" disks; 3.5\\" drives were used for data storage, with the exception of the Japanese MSX standard, on which 5.25\\" floppies were never popular. Standardization of disk formats was not common; sometimes even different models from the same manufacturer used different disk formats. Almost universally the floppy disk drives available for 8-bit home computers were housed in external cases with their own controller boards and power supplies contained within. Only the later, advanced 8-bit home computers housed their drives within the main unit; these included the TRS-80 Model III, TRS-80 Model 4, Apple IIc, MSX2, and Commodore 128D. The later 16-bit machines such as the Atari 1040ST (not the 520ST), the Commodore Amigas, and the Tandy 1000s did house floppy drive(s) internally. At any rate, to expand any computer with additional floppy drives external units would have to be plugged in. Toward the end of the home computer era, drives for a number of home computer models appeared offering disk-format compatibility with the IBM PC. The disk drives sold with the Commodore 128, Amiga and Atari ST were all able to read and write PC disks, which themselves were undergoing the transition from 5.25\\" to 3.5\\" format at the time (though 5.25\\" drives remained common on PCs until the late 1990s, due to existence of the large software and data archives on five-inch floppies). 5.25\\" drives were made available for the ST, Amiga and Macintosh, otherwise 3.5\\" based systems with no other use for a 5.25\\" format. Hard drives were never popular on home computers, remaining an expensive, niche product mainly for BBS sysops and the few business users. Various copy protection schemes were developed for floppy disks; most were broken in short order. Many users would only tolerate copy protection for games, as wear and tear on disks was a significant issue in an entirely floppy-based system. The ability to make a \\"working backup\\" disk of vital application software was seen as important. Copy programs that advertised their ability to copy or even remove common protection schemes were a common category of utility software in this pre-DMCA era. In another defining characteristic of the home computer, instead of a command line, the BASIC interpreter served double duty as a user interface. Coupled to a character- based screen or line editor, BASIC's file management commands could be entered in direct mode. In contrast to modern computers, home computers most often had their operating system (OS) stored in ROM chips. This made startup times very fast ‚Äì no more than a few seconds ‚Äì but made OS upgrades difficult or impossible without buying a new unit. Usually only the most severe bugs were fixed by issuing new ROMs to replace the old ones at the user's cost. Also, the small size and limited scope of home computer \\"operating systems\\" (really little more than what today would be called a kernel) left little room for bugs to hide. Although modern operating systems include extensive programming libraries to ease development and promote standardization, home computer operating systems provided little support to application programs. Professionally written software often switched out the ROM based OS anyway to free the address space it occupied and maximize RAM capacity. This gave the program full control of the hardware and allowed the programmer to optimize performance for a specific task. Games would often turn off unused I/O ports, as well as the interrupts that served them. As multitasking was never common on home computers, this practice went largely unnoticed by users. Most software even lacked an exit command, requiring a reboot to use the system for something else. In an enduring reflection of their early cassette-oriented nature, most home computers loaded their disk operating system (DOS) separately from the main OS. The DOS was only used for disk and file related commands and was not required to perform other computing functions. One exception was Commodore DOS, which was not loaded into the computer's main memory at all - Commodore disk drives contained a 6502 processor and ran DOS from internal ROM. While this gave Commodore systems some advanced capabilities - a utility program could sideload a disk copy routine onto the drive and return control to the user while the drive copied the disk on its own - it also made Commodore drives more expensive and difficult to clone. Many home computers had a cartridge interface which accepted ROM-based software. This was also used for expansion or upgrades such as fast loaders. Application software on cartridge did exist, which loaded instantly and eliminated the need for disk swapping on single drive setups, but the vast majority of cartridges were games.List of TI99/4 cartridges, mostly games from OldComputers.net  PCs at home  From the introduction of the IBM Personal Computer (ubiquitously known as the PC) in 1981, the market for computers meant for the corporate, business, and government sectors came to be dominated by the new machine and its MS-DOS operating system. Even basic PCs cost thousands of dollars and were far out of reach for typical home computerists. However, in the following years technological advances and improved manufacturing capabilities (mainly greater use of robotics and relocation of production plants to lower-wage locations in Asia) permitted several computer companies to offer lower-cost PC style machines that would become competitive with many 8-bit home-market pioneers like Radio Shack, Commodore, Atari, Texas Instruments, and Sinclair. PCs could never become as affordable as these because the same price-reducing measures were available to all computer makers. Furthermore, software and peripherals for PC style computers tended to cost more than those for 8-bit computers because of the anchoring effect caused by the pricey IBM PC. As well, PCs were inherently more expensive since they could not use the home TV set as a video display. Nonetheless, the overall reduction in manufacturing costs narrowed the price difference between old 8-bit technology and new PCs. Despite their higher absolute prices PCs were perceived by many to be better values for their utility as superior productivity tools and their access to industry-standard software. Another advantage was the 8088/8086's wide, 20-bit address bus: the PC could access more than 64 kilobytes of memory relatively inexpensively (8-bit CPUs, which generally had multiplexed 16-bit address buses, required complicated, tricky memory management techniques like bank-switching). Similarly, the default PC floppy was double-sided with about twice the storage capacity of floppy disks used by 8-bit home computers. PC drives tended to cost less because they were most often built-in, requiring no external case, controller, and power supply. The faster clock rates and wider buses available to later Intel CPUs compensated somewhat for the custom graphics and sound chips of the Commodores and Ataris. In time the growing popularity of home PCs spurred many software publishers to offer gaming and children's software titles. Many decision makers in the computer industry believed there could be a viable market for office workers who used PC/DOS computers at their jobs and would appreciate an ability to bring diskettes of data home on weeknights and weekends to continue work after-hours on their \\"home\\" computers. So the ability to run industry- standard MS-DOS software on affordable, user-friendly PCs was anticipated as a source of new sales. Furthermore, many in the industry felt that MS-DOS would eventually (inevitably, it seemed) come to dominate the computer business entirely, and some manufacturers felt the need to offer individual customers PC-style products suitable for the home market. In early 1984 market colossus IBM produced the PCjr as a PC/DOS-compatible machine aimed squarely at the home user. It proved a spectacular failure because IBM deliberately limited its capabilities and expansion possibilities in order to avoid cannibalizing sales of the profitable PC. IBM management believed that if they made the PCjr too powerful too many buyers would prefer it over the bigger, more expensive PC. Poor reviews in the computer press and poor sales doomed the PCjr. Tandy Corporation capitalized on IBM's blunder with its PCjr-compatible Tandy 1000 in November. Like the PCjr it was pitched as a home, education, and small- business computer featuring joystick ports, better sound and graphics (same as the PCjr but with enhancements), combined with near-PC/DOS compatibility (unlike Tandy's earlier Tandy 2000). The improved Tandy 1000 video hardware became a standard of its own, known as Tandy Graphics Adapter or TGA. Later Tandy produced Tandy 1000 variants in form factors and price-points even more suited to the home computer market, comprised particularly by the Tandy 1000 EX and HX models (later supplanted by the 1000 RL), which came in cases resembling the original Apple IIs (CPU, keyboard, expansion slots, and power supply in a slimline cabinet) but also included floppy disk drives. The proprietary Deskmate productivity suite came bundled with the Tandy 1000s. Deskmate was suited to use by computer novices with its point-and-click (though not graphical) user interface. From the launch of the Tandy 1000 series, their manufacture were price-competitive because of Tandy's use of high-density ASIC chip technology, which allowed their engineers to integrate many hardware features into the motherboard (obviating the need for circuit cards in expansion slots as with other brands of PC). Tandy never transferred its manufacturing operation to Asia; all Tandy desktop computers were built in the USA (this was not true of the laptop and pocket computers, nor peripherals). In 1985 the Epson corporation, a popular and respected producer of inexpensive dot-matrix printers and business computers (the QX-10 and QX-16), introduced its low-cost Epson Equity PC. Its designers took minor shortcuts such as few expansion slots and a lack of a socket for an 8087 math chip, but Epson did bundle some utility programs that offered decent turnkey functionality for novice users. While not a high performer, the Equity was a reliable and compatible design for half the price of a similarly-configured IBM PC. Epson often promoted sales by bundling one of their printers with it at cost. The Equity I sold well enough to warrant the furtherance of the Equity line with the follow-on Equity II and Equity III. In 1986 UK home computer maker Amstrad began producing their PC1512 PC-compatible for sale in the UK. Later they would market the machine in the US as the PC6400. In June 1987 an improved model was produced as the PC1640. These machines had fast 8086 CPUs, enhanced CGA graphics, and were feature-laden for their modest prices. They had joystick adapters built into their keyboards and shipped with a licensed version of the Digital Research's GEM, a GUI for the MS-DOS operating system. They became marginal successes in the home market. In 1987 longtime small computer maker Zenith introduced a low-cost PC they called the EaZy PC. This was positioned as an \\"appliance\\" computer much like the original Apple Macintosh: turnkey startup, built-in monochrome video monitor, and lacking expansion slots requiring proprietary add-ons available only from Zenith, but instead with the traditional MS-DOS Command-line interface. The EaZy PC used a turbo NEC V40 CPU (uprated 8088) which was rather slow for its time, but the video monitor did feature 400 pixel vertical resolution. This unique computer failed for the same reasons as did IBM's PCjr: poor performance and expandability, and a price too high for the home market. Another company that offered low-cost PCs for home use was Leading Edge with their Model M and Model D computers. These were configured like full-featured business PCs yet still could compete in the home market on price because Leading Edge had access to low-cost hardware from their Asian manufacturing partners Mitsubishi with the Model M and Daewoo with the Model D. The LEWP was bundled with the Model D. It was favorably reviewed by the computer press and sold very well. By the mid-80s the market for inexpensive PCs for use in the home market was expanding at a rate such that the two leaders in the US, Commodore and Atari, themselves felt compelled to enter the market with their own lines. They were only marginally successful compared to other companies that made only PCs. Still later prices of white box PC clone computers by various manufacturers became competitive with the higher-end home computers (see below). Throughout the 1980s costs and prices continued to be driven down by: advanced circuit design and manufacturing, multifunction expansion cards, shareware applications such as PC-Talk, PC-Write, and PC-File, greater hardware reliability, and more user-friendly software that demanded less customer support services. The increasing availability of faster processor and memory chips, inexpensive EGA and VGA video cards, sound cards, and joystick adapters also bolstered the viability of PC/DOS computers as alternatives to specially-made computers and game consoles for the home.  High performance  From about 1985 the high end of the home computer market began to be dominated by \\"next generation\\" home computers using the 16-bit Motorola 68000 chip, which enabled the greatly increased abilities of the Amiga and Atari ST series (in the UK the Sinclair QL was built around the Motorola 68008 with its external 8-bit bus). Graphics resolutions approximately doubled to give roughly NTSC-class resolution, and color palettes increased from dozens to hundreds or thousands of colors available. The Amiga was built with a custom chipset with dedicated graphics and sound coprocessors for high performance video and audio. The Amiga found use as a workstation for desktop video, a first for a standalone computer costing far less than dedicated motion-video processing equipment costing many thousands of dollars. Stereo sound became standard for the first time; the Atari ST gained popularity as an affordable alternative for MIDI equipment for the production of music. Clock rates on the 68000-based systems were approximately 8 MHz with RAM capacities of 256 KB (for the base Amiga 1000) up to 1024 KB (1 megabyte, a milestone, first seen on the Atari 1040ST). These systems used 3.5\\" floppy disks from the beginning but 5.25\\" drives were made available to facilitate data exchange with IBM PC compatibles. The Amiga and ST both had GUIs with windowing technology. These were inspired by the Apple Macintosh, but at a list price of US$2495 (), the Macintosh itself was too expensive for most households. The Commodore Amiga in particular had true multitasking capability and unlike all other low-cost computers of the era could run multiple applications in their own windows.  MSX  MSX was a standard for a home computing architecture that was intended and hoped to become a universal platform for home computing. It was conceived, engineered and marketed by Microsoft Japan with ASCII Corporation. Computers conforming to the MSX standard were produced by most all major Japanese electronics manufacturers, as well as two Korean ones and several others in Europe and South America. Some 5 million units are known to have been sold in Japan alone. They sold in smaller numbers throughout the world. Due to the \\"price wars\\" being waged in the USA home computer market during the 1983-85 period, MSX computers were never marketed to any great extent in the USA. Eventually more advanced mainstream home computers and game consoles obsoleted the MSX machines. The MSX computers were built around the Zilog Z80 8-bit processor, assisted with dedicated video graphics and audio coprocessors supplied by Intel, Texas Instruments, and General Instrument. MSX computers received a great deal of software support from the traditional Japanese publishers of game software, but never garnered such support from publishers of productivity applications. Microsoft did, however, produce a special version of the BASIC programming language that ran under MSX. Radio frequency interference After the first wave of game consoles and computers landed in American homes, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began receiving complaints of electromagnetic interference to television reception. By 1979 the FCC demanded that home computer makers submit samples for radio frequency interference testing. It was found that \\"first generation\\" home computers emitted too much radio frequency noise for household use. The Atari 400 and 800 were designed with heavy RF shielding to meet the new requirements. Between 1980 and 1982 regulations governing RF emittance from home computers were phased in. Some companies appealed to the FCC to waive the requirements for home computers, while others (with compliant designs) objected to the waiver. Eventually techniques to suppress interference became standardized.TRS-80 the \\"Trash-80\\" from PC-History.org Reception and sociological impact In 1977, referring to computers used in home automation at the dawn of the home computer era, Digital Equipment Corporation CEO Ken Olsen is quoted as saying \\"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\\" Despite Olsen's warning, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, from about 1977 to 1983, it was widely predictedThe Computer Revolution from eNotes.com that computers would soon revolutionize many aspects of home and family life as they had business practices in the previous decades.The computer revolution from The Eighties Club Mothers would keep their recipe catalog in \\"kitchen computer\\" databases and turn to a medical database for help with child care, fathers would use the family's computer to manage family finances and track automobile maintenance. Children would use online encyclopedias for school work and would be avid video gamers. The computer would even be tasked with babysitting younger children. Home automation would bring about the intelligent home of the 1980s. Using Videotex, NAPLPS or some sort of vaguely conceptualized computer technology, television would gain interactivity. It would be possible to do the week's grocery shopping through the television. The \\"personalized newspaper\\" (to be displayed on the television screen) was another commonly predicted application. Morning coffee would be brewed automatically under computer control. The same household computer would control the home's lighting and temperature. Robots would take the garbage out, and be programmed to perform new tasks via the home computer. Electronics were expensive, so it was generally assumed that each home would have only one computer for the entire family to use. Home control would be performed in a multitasking time-sharing arrangement, with interfaces to the various devices it was expected to control. All this was predicted to be commonplace by the end of the 1980s, but by 1987 Dan Gutman wrote that the predicted revolution was \\"in shambles\\", with only 15% of American homes owning a computer. Virtually every aspect that was foreseen would be delayed to later years or would be entirely surpassed by later technological developments. The home computers of the early 1980s could not multitask, which meant that using one as a home automation or entertainment appliance would require it be kept powered on at all times and dedicated exclusively for this use. Even if the computers could be used for multiple purposes simultaneously as today, other technical limitations predominated; memory capacities were too small to hold entire encyclopedias or databases of financial records; floppy disk-based storage was inadequate in both capacity and speed for multimedia work; and the home computers' graphics chips could only display blocky, unrealistic images and blurry, jagged text that would be difficult to read a newspaper from. Although CD-ROM technology was introduced in 1985 with much promise for its future use, the drives were prohibitively expensive and only interfaced with IBM PCs and compatibles. The Boston Phoenix stated in 1983 that \\"people are catching on to the fact that 'applications' like balancing your checkbook and filing kitchen recipes are actually faster and easier to do with a pocket calculator and a box of index cards\\". inCider observed that \\"companies cannot live by dilettantes alone\\". Gutman wrote that when the first computer boom ended in 1984, \\"Suddenly, everybody was saying that the home computer was a fad, just another hula hoop\\". Robert Lydon, publisher of Personal Computing, stated in 1985 that the home market \\"never really existed. It was a fad. Just about everyone who was going to buy a computer for their home has done it\\", and predicted that Apple would cease to exist within two years. A backlash set in; computer users were \\"geeks\\", \\"nerds\\" or worse, \\"hackers\\". The North American video game crash of 1983 soured many on home computer technology as users saw large investments in 'the technology of the future' turn into dead- ends when manufacturers pulled out of the market or went out of business. The computers that were bought for use in the family room were either forgotten in closets or relegated to basements and children's bedrooms to be used exclusively for games and the occasional book report. Home computers of the 1980s have been called \\"a technology in search of a use\\". In 1984 Tandy executive Steve Leininger, designer of the TRS-80 Model I, admitted that \\"As an industry we haven't found any compelling reason to buy a computer for the home\\" other than for word processing. A 1985 study found that, during a typical week, 40% of adult computer owners did not use their computers at all. Usage rates among children were higher, with households reporting that only 16-20% of children aged 6‚Äì‚Äì17 did not use the computer during a typical week. It would take another 10 years for technology to mature, for the graphical user interface to make the computer approachable for non-technical users, and for the World Wide Web to provide a compelling reason for most people to want a computer in their homes. Separate 1998 studies found that 75% of Americans with Internet access accessed primarily from home and that not having Internet access at home inhibited Internet use. Predicted aspects of the revolution were left by the wayside or modified in the face of an emerging reality. The cost of electronics dropped precipitously and today many families have a computer for each family member, although shared desktop machines are still common. Encyclopedias, recipe catalogs and medical databases are kept online and accessed over the World Wide Web ‚Äì not stored locally on floppy disks or CD-ROM. TV has yet to gain substantial interactivity; instead, the web has evolved alongside television, giving rise to the second screen concept. The HTPC and services like Netflix, Google TV or Apple TV, along with internet video sites such as YouTube and Hulu, may one day replace traditional broadcast and cable television. Our coffee may be brewed automatically every morning, but the computer is a simple one embedded in the coffee maker, not under external control. As of 2008, robots are just beginning to make an impact in the home, with Roomba and Aibo leading the charge. This delay wasn't out of keeping with other technologies newly introduced to an unprepared public. Early motorists were widely derided with the cry of \\"Get a horse!\\"Horseless Classrooms from the Hawaii Education & Research Network until the automobile was accepted. Television languished in research labs for decades before regular public broadcasts began. In an example of changing applications for technology, before the invention of radio, the telephone was used to distribute opera and news reports, whose subscribers were denounced as \\"illiterate, blind, bedridden and incurably lazy people\\".Clement Ader from Beb's Old Phones Likewise, the acceptance of computers into daily life today is a product of continuing refinement of both technology and perception. Use in the 21st century Retrocomputing is the use of vintage hardware, possibly performing modern tasks such as surfing the web and email. As programming techniques evolved and these systems were well-understood after decades of use, it became possible to write software giving home computers capabilities undreamed of by their designers. The Contiki OS implements a GUI and TCP/IP stack on the Apple II, Commodore 8-bit and Atari ST (16-bit) platforms, allowing these home computers to function as both internet clients and servers. The Commodore 64 has been repackaged as the C-One and C64 Direct-to- TV, both designed by Jeri Ellsworth with modern enhancements. Throughout the 1990s and 1st decade of the 21st century, many home computer systems were available inexpensively at garage sales and on eBay. Many enthusiasts started to collect home computers, with older and rarer systems being much sought after. Sometimes the collections turned into a virtual museum presented on web sites. As their often-inexpensively manufactured hardware ages and the supply of replacement parts dwindles, it has become popular among enthusiastsReviving Old Computer Games from xtrazone.com to emulate these machines, recreating their software environments on modern computers. One of the more well-known emulators is the Multi Emulator Super System (MESS) which can emulate most of the better-known home computers. A more or less complete list of home computer emulators can be found in the List of computer system emulators article. Games for many 8 and 16 bit home computers are becoming available for the Wii Virtual Console. Notable home computers The 1977 Apple II with two Disk II disk drives and an Apple monitor The time line below describes many of the most popular or significant home computers of the late 1970s and of the 1980s. The most popular home computers in the USA up to 1985 were: the TRS-80 (1977), various models of the Apple II family (first introduced in 1977), the Atari 400/800 (1979) along with its follow up models the 800XL and 130XE, and the Commodore VIC-20 (1980) and the Commodore 64 (1982). The VIC was the first computer of any type to sell over one million units, and the 64 is still the highest-selling single model of personal computer ever, with over 17 million produced before production stopped in 1994 ‚Äì a 12-year run with only minor changes. At one point in 1983 Commodore was selling as many 64s as the rest of the industry's computers combined. The British market was different, as relatively high prices and lower disposable incomes reduced the appeal of most American products. New Scientist stated in 1977 that \\"the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain\\". The Commodore 64 was also popular, but a BYTE columnist stated in 1985: Many of the British-made systems like Sinclair's ZX81 and Spectrum, and later the Amstrad/Schneider CPC were much more widely used in Europe than US systems. A few low-cost British Sinclair models were sold in the US by Timex Corporation as the Timex Sinclair 1000 and the ill-fated Timex Sinclair 2068, but neither established a strong following. The only transatlantic success was the Commodore 64, which competed favorably price-wise with the British systems, and was the most popular system in Europe as in the USA.Format Wars: The Tech that should have Won from ArmchairArcade.com Until the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981, computers such as the Apple II and TRS 80 also found considerable use in office work.Tandy TRS-80 catalog listing many business uses (PDF) In 1983 IBM introduced the PCjr in an attempt to continue their business computer success in the home computer market, but incompatibilities between it and the standard PC kept users away. Assisted by a large public domain software library and promotional offers from Commodore, the PET had a sizable presence in the North American education market until that segment was largely ceded to the Apple II as Commodore focused on the C-64's success in the mass retail market. 1970s Three microcomputers were the prototypes for what would later become the home computer market segment; but when introduced they sold as much to hobbyists and small businesses as to the home. * June 1977: Apple II (North America), color graphics, eight expansion slots; one of the first computers to use a typewriter-like plastic case design. * August 1977: Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 (N. Am.), first home computer for less than US$600, used a dedicated monitor for US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules compliance. * October 1977: Commodore PET (N.

Commodore press release. \\"The PET computer made its debut recently as the first 100 units were shipped to waiting customers in mid-October 1977.\\" * In 1977 Compucolor II, although shipments did not start until the next year. The Compucolor II was smaller, less expensive than first model which was an upgrade kit for the company's color computer terminal, turning the Intercolor 8001 into the Compucolor 8001 and used the newly-introduced 5.25-inch floppy disks instead of the former 8-inch models.ComputerCloset.org - Information about the Compucolor II The following computers also introduced significant advancements to the home computer segment: * 1979: TI-99/4, first home computer with a 16-bit processor and first to add sprite graphics * 1979: Atari 400/800 (N.

The team evolved from a number of pro players who played with the Union Club of Phoenixville during their 1920 season. During their only season of operation, the club won the \\"Philadelphia City Championship\\". All of the team's home games were played at the Baker Bowl. History Origins At the end of a highly successful 1920 football season, the team's coach and captain, Heinie Miller, created a proposal for the directors of the Phoenixville Union Club to sponsor his pro football team for a second season. The team was to have the same line-up as the previous year's. However, the proposal was declined by the Club who opted instead to field a less costly team of mostly local talent. As a result, Miller and Leo Conway quickly announced the formation of the Union Athletic Association of Philadelphia. The Union Club, however, was often referred to by the press as the \\"Union Athletic Association\\", a name that was associated with the Phoenixville team. So to avoid confusion, the new organization's name was soon changed to the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. The \\"Union\\" reference was kept as an attempt to maintain some continuity and to remind the fans that this was essentially the same line-up that had been so successful in Phoenixille in 1920. The team was also feature many players from the University of Pennsylvania, who were nicknamed the \\"Quakers\\". For example, Bill Hollenback a former All-American at Penn played for the Union Quakers in 1921, as did future Philadelphia Eagles founder, co-owner and coach, Bert Bell. The team's manager Leo Conway was also Penn alumnus as were most of the Union Quakers offensive linemen, like Heinie Miller, Lou Little and Lud Wray. 1921 season =3-1 start= In their inaugural game the Union Quakers defeated the Shenandoah Yellow Jackets 24-0. The Yellow Jackets were members of the Anthracite League, a group of teams located in Pennsylvania's coal mining belt. For their second game of the 1921 campaign, the Union Quakers defeated another Anthracite team, the Coaldale Big Green 2-0. The game's only score came via a safety, by Stan Cofall. However a week later, the Union Quakers were scheduled to play the New York Brickley Giants, a member of the American Professional Football Association. While a fumble from Philadelphia's Clarence Beck, led to a Giants field goal in the game's opening minutes, the Union Quakers defense prevented the Giants from gaining a first down the whole game. However Philadelphia was unable to score the entire game and lost their first game of the season 3-0. After the Giants game, Philadelphia played the Holmesburg Athletic Club. Holmesburg, Conshohocken Athletic Club and the pre- NFL Frankford Yellow Jackets were considered the top teams in eastern Pennsylvania at the time. The Union Quakers defeated Holmesburg 21-0, by way of two Johnny Scott touchdowns and one by Ockie Anderson. However, the biggest game of the season would take place a week later as Philadelphia was scheduled to play another AFPA team, the Canton Bulldogs. The previous season, while still under the Phoenixville moniker, the Union Quakers defeated the Bulldogs 7-3. The 1921 Bulldogs team no longer featured the legendary Jim Thorpe, however newer players like Pete Henry and Pie Way has stepped up to create a strong team. =Cancellation and dispute with Buffalo= The night before the Bulldogs game, Frank McNeil, the owner of the Buffalo All-Americans lodged a protest with APFA officials regarding the Quakers-Bulldogs game. Many of the Buffalo players were associated with the Quakers in 1921, just as they had been with the Phoenixville team the previous year. These players would play a non-league game with the Quakers on Saturdays and then take a train to Buffalo and the next day's game. This arrangement helped the Buffalo players, earn extra money in between league games. McNeil felt that his team's poor performance in a crucial game against the Akron Pros, was due to his key players being exhausted from Union's victory over Holmesburg two days earlier. Meanwhile, Buffalo was still a contender to win 1921 AFPA Championship and was scheduled to Canton the day after Union. McNeil feared that his players would be too tired from playing with the Quakers that they would deliver another lackluster performance and lose not only the game to Canton, but eliminate themselves from winning the AFPA title. McNeil then told Canton that the rules league's rules governing games against non-league teams were prohibited without the prior approval of the league. As a result, Canton cancelled their game against the Quakers. Meanwhile, Heinie Miller, Lud Wray, Lou Little, Johnny Scott and Butch Spagna, who were previously involved in an ongoing financial dispute with McNeil, decided to leave the All-Americans and played the remainder of the season with the Quakers. Leo Conway was able to arrange for the Union Quakers to play another AFPA team, to make up for the loss of the Canton game. The Rochester Jeffersons played the Quakers to a 3-3 tie. Since the Jeffs were losing large amounts of money during the 1921 season and needed the revenue from the Union Quakers game, the AFPA decided to not interfere. Buffalo's Swede Youngstrom and Pat Smith played for Quakers against Rochester before heading back to Buffalo for that club's game with Canton. It would be their last game for the Quakers. =Strong schedule= The Quakers brought in to strengthen their roster. These players included Jim Laird, who had previously faced the Quakers as a member of both the Brickley Giants and Rochester Jeffersons, future Hall of Famer Joe Guyon and Pete Calac, both of whom were playing with the Cleveland Tigers at the time. The team then prepared to play another top independent eastern Pennsylvania team the Conshohocken Athletic Club. That game resulted in 14-0 Union Quakers victory. Two days later the Quakers travelled to Frankford to take on the pre-NFL Frankford Yellow Jackets. Tiny Maxwell, a former pro and college football standout, officiated the game, which ended in a scoreless tie. On December 3, 1921, the Union Quakers were finally able to schedule and play a game against the Canton Bulldogs. Despite a hard fought game, the Quakers lost the game, 14-9, due to a late touchdown reception by Canton's Harry Robb. =City champions= However, the Union Quakers soon scheduled rematches against Frankford and Canton. They also signed two former Penn State Nittany Lions' football players, Hinkey Haines and Harry Robb, who had just caught the winning touchdown for Canton, during the December 3rd contest. The Quakers- Yellow Jackets game resulted in 7-0 victory for the Union Quakers and gave them bragging rights as the Philadelphia City Champions. Afterwards the Quakers entered into a rematch against the Canton Bulldogs. The second game between the two teams, resulted in a 34-0 Union Quakers victory. Possible NFL franchise? Since the team's time in Phoenixville in 1920, Leo Conway had been trying to get the club into the AFPA. He had been present at several league meetings and before the 1921 season and had met with several franchise owners during the season. Wins over the Canton Bulldogs and Frankford Yellow Jackets showed that the Union Quakers could be a strong team in the league. During the off season Leo Conway and Heinie Miller attended meetings of the APFA. Before those series of meetings, two major items were decided. It was first concluded the APFA would change its name to the National Football League, and that Philadelphia would be awarded a league franchise. However, for reasons unknown (the heavy use of players already on NFL teams and Pennsylvania's still-extant blue laws were likely factors), the Union Quakers plans to enter the NFL were eventually dropped. Whatever members of the Union Quakers team who were not already on an NFL squad were absorbed by the Frankford Yellow Jackets, who posted a 13-0-1 record in 1922. Leo Conway disappeared from the Phialdelphia football scene until 1926 when he went on to own and manage the similarly named Philadelphia Quakers of the first American Football League. That team would go on to win the league's only championship. Bell and Wray would later re-emerge as the owners and founders of the modern- day Philadelphia Eagles team, which was founded in 1933 after the Yellow Jackets folded in 1931.

Life He was probably a near relation of Margaret Fell. At the age of fourteen he was taken by his father to Swarthmoor, near Ulverston, to be educated by a kinsman who was then tutor to the Fell family; the boy was then sent to a school at Hawkshead. In 1652 George Fox paid his first visit to Swarthmoor Hall, and Caton embraced quakerism. He now refused to study on the ground of its being a worldly occupation, and Margaret Fell employed him at Swarthmore to teach her younger children and act as her secretary. When he was about eighteen, Caton was chosen one of the quaker preachers for the district, and in his Journal he relates that he was often met with violence by the people of the places in which he attempted to preach. In 1654 he left Swarthmore in order to become an itinerant preacher. Towards the end of the year he was joined by John Stubbs, with whom he proceeded to Maidstone. Here they were both sent to the house of correction and harshly treated, but the only charge against them was preaching, and the magistrates released them. About the middle of 1655 Caton went to Calais, preaching through an interpreter, and returned to England. After a preaching tour, which lasted some months, he went to the Dutch Republic, hoping to convert the Dutch. At Vlissingen and Middelburg he found English congregations, and was roughly handled at both places for interrupting their services. At the end of 1655 he was again in England. He next made an attempt to promulgate quakerism in Scotland, and was the messenger from the Friends in England to General George Monck. Early in 1656 Caton was imprisoned for a short time at Congleton. Towards the end of this year he returned to the Dutch Republic, and decided to settle in Amsterdam, where there was a small Quaker community. He spent some time between England and the Dutch Republic. At the end of 1660 he had an interview with Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine at Heidelberg, to plead for liberty of conscience. About 1662 he married Annekin Derrix or Derricks, a Dutch quakeress. On a later journey to the Dutch Republic he was forced to take shelter in Yarmouth Roads, where he landed, and was imprisoned for nearly five months for refusing the oath of allegiance. He returned to the Dutch Republic. His last known letter is dated 8th month 1665 (O.S.), and Barclay, in his reprint of Caton's ‚ÄòJournal,‚Äô states that there is reason to believe that he died towards the end of 1665. Works He wrote both in English and Dutch, and his style was more simple and pointed than that of most of the seventeenth-century Friends. In England, the Dutch Republic, and Germany his works were for more than a century highly esteemed. His principal works were: * ‚ÄòA True Declaration of the Bloody Proceedings of the Men of Maidstone,‚Äô 1655. * ‚ÄòThe Moderate Enquirer resolved ‚Ä¶ by way of Conference concerning the condemned People commonly called Quakers,‚Äô &c.;, 1659 (translated into Dutch as ‚ÄòDen matelijcken Ondersoeker voldaen‚Äô in 1669). * ‚ÄòTruth's Character of Professors ‚Ä¶‚Äô 1660. * ‚ÄòAn Epistle to King Charles II sent from Amsterdam in Holland, the 28 of the 10 month, 1660.‚Äô * ‚ÄòWilliam Caton's Salutation and Advice unto God's Elect,‚Äô 1660. * ‚ÄòAn Abridgement; or a Compendious Commemoration of the Remarkable Chronologies which are contained in that famous Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus,‚Äô 1661 (reprinted as ‚ÄòAn Abridgement of Eusebius Pamphilius's Ecclesiastical History‚Äô). * ‚ÄòThe Testimony of a Cloud of Witnesses,‚Äô &c.;, 1662. * ‚ÄòTwo General Epistles given forth in Yarmouth Common Gaol,‚Äô 1663. * ‚ÄòA Journal of the Life of ‚Ä¶ Will.

Her maternal grandfather was Robert \\"bob\\" Eaton. He was a member of the Grand Ole Opry in the 1950s and was signed to Decca records. In later years he was a frequent guest on the Ralph Emery show and was known as \\"roadmap Bob\\". On the Ralph Emery show, Cortney made her first television debut at age 5. Sitting on her mother's lap, Emery asked her who her favorite country performer was, to which she proclaimed Conway Twitty. She then sang ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not lisa‚Äô. Most of her family played at or was associated with The Grand Ole Opry. Her mother Connie Eaton was a celebrity in Nashville. She was friends with Jack Clement and spent a lot of time on music row in his office writing songs and collaborating with other musicians such as Townes Van Zandt, Kris Kristofferson. She was also a dear friend of Shel Silverstein. Though Connie remained in the music scene , she steadily withdrew and spent most of her time at home in the mid 1980s. Connie, Cortney's mother, was diagnosed with manic depression in the early 1970s, and Cortney and the family struggled to understand and cope with her mother's illness. In fact, everyone discouraged Cortney of pursuing music, but Cortney did not listen, She married and started a family while playing more guitar and singing.

In 2004, Tidwell began recording with her husband, renowned producer and acclaimed recording engineer and musician Todd Tidwell manning the studio, often contributing his own playing and songwriting to his wife's songs.

The Nashville scene consistently sang her praises and the late editor, Jim Ridley called her \\"Nashville‚Äôs real songbird\\" , She performed at Springwater with various musicians, but then began playing all the instruments herself at the same time due to raising the children and working As a preschool teacher , this was the best she could do without a band.

Construction of the hotel began in 1881 on a hill east of the downtown overlooking the town and the harbour. Had it been completed the hotel would have been a major landmark on the Oban skyline. The hotel was never completed due to financial difficulties and currently lies in ruins.  History  Hydropathy, the use of water for treating diseases and soothing pains, was very popular amongst the wealthy in 19th century Britain, with several Hydropathic Hotels being built around Scotland. With the newly arrived railway making Oban accessible to Glasgow and Edinburgh a group of Glasgow businessmen formed the Oban Hills Hydropathic Sanatorium Limited in 1881. The proposed hotel was to have contained 137 bedrooms, a conservatory, a concert hall and seawater baths. There were also plans for a golf course, stables, landscaped gardens and a hydraulic lift to bring guests up from the town. Robert MacAlpine and Co. was contracted for the construction and 300 workers were employed in building the hotel. A miniature railway was built to carry construction materials up the hill. By 1882 the roof timbers were in place and the hotel was distinctly visible from the town below. Oban Hydro ruins, 2015 However, the project soon fell into financial difficulty, the cost of the hotel having been grossly underestimated. Shareholders were unwilling to continue financing the construction and the nearly-completed hotel was abandoned. The structure slowly fell into ruin as local residents pillaged stones to build their own homes. The Old Hydro is now barely visible from the town below.  References  *Oban War and Peace Museum.

Despite shinty's profile in the town, efforts are afoot to evict Fort William Shinty Club from An Aird, in order to build a supermarket. The local authority, Highland Council, have come under fire for their care of the park, especially after the playing surface was stripped bare by rabbits. The company behind the planned development of a new supermarket were unequivocal in stating in April 2007 that there would be no development upon the An Aird pitch. . In March 2008, Highland Council again came under fire for their negligence of the An Aird surface, which almost resulted in the loss of An Aird's prestigious status as a Camanachd Cup Final host stadium. In February 2009 the stadium was attacked by vandals causing thousands of pounds of damage. The shinty club will be forced to move to the Black Park in Fort William in season 2010 in order for renovation work to be done on the pitch at An Aird. The area was again marked for development in late 2010 with plans being made by an Edinburgh-based company to develop the site for a supermarket. This would involve moving the shinty club to a new location within the town. Uncertainty over the availability of An Aird led to it losing the 2011 Camanachd Cup Final. The club used Black Parks, near Inverlochy, for most of 2012.

Munger (1883 - 1975) was a pioneering research scientist for the U.S. Forest Service in the Pacific Northwest, known for founding research operations at the Wind River Experimental Forest. Early life Thornton Taft Munger was born in North Adams, Massachusetts on October 3, 1883. Munger grew up next to the large estate of Hillhouse Woods, an eighteen-acre natural area, which facilitated his lifelong interest in forests. Munger went to Yale, graduating in 1905, also earning a master's degree in forestry from the school in 1908. After receiving his master's degree, Munger went to work for the U.S. Forest Service. Forest Service In 1908, Munger was assigned to the Forest Service's new North Pacific District in Portland, Oregon. Almost immediately, Munger began his influential studies of the Douglas fir trees found in the western Cascades, establishing research plots in the Wind River area. In 1912, Munger established an arboretum in the area, the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest. Munger used the arboretum to test the suitability of exotic trees in the specific climate and conditions of the Pacific Northwest. After working to further establish the Wind River Arboretum, as well as a nearby nursery, the area was selected by the Forest Service to be a permanent research site. In 1913, the Wind River Experiment Station was officially designated by the Forest Service. In 1924, the Wind River Experimental Station was replaced by the new Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, with offices in Portland, Oregon. Munger was selected as the first director of the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station. Munger continued his research at Wind River until his retirement for the Forest Service in 1946. Wind River was the site of valuable long-term studies of plants and wildlife in the Pacific Northwest, with many of the projects continuing on for decades. Munger‚Äôs pioneering research legacy at Wind River was permanently honored following his death on August 11, 1975, when the Thornton T. Munger Research Natural Area was officially designated on Wind River Forest lands in 1977. Civic Activism In the mid-1940s, Munger became the first chairman of the Forest Park Committee of Fifty, a committee created by the Portland City Club and the Mazamas to promote creation of a large forested park in the West Hills of Portland, Oregon.Forest Park entry in the Oregon Encyclopedia The city dedicated Forest Park in 1948. Munger later co-wrote a history of the park.Munger, Thornton T. and C. Paul Keyser, History of Portland‚Äôs Forest- Park. Portland, Ore.: Committee of Fifty, 1960. The Committee of Fifty eventually became the Forest Park Conservancy. References External links * Thornton T.

Biography Born at Chilly-Mazarin, a southern suburb of Paris, he was the illegitimate son of Philippe d'Orl√©ans (future Regent of France, 1715‚Äì1723, acting for the infant Louis XV) and his mistress Marie-Louise Madeleine Victorine Le Bel de La Bussi√®re (1684‚Äì1748), known as the comtesse d'Argenton or madame d'Argenton. His mother, known as Mademoiselle de S√©ry was Lady-in-waiting to the Dowager Duchess of Orl√©ans. She started an affair with Philippe d'Orl√©ans, son of the Dowager Duchess. This infuriated Louis XIV, who maintained that actresses were bad enough, particularly when they gave birth to sons, but which the Duchess of Orl√©ans did not. As well, by flaunting S√©ry, Philippe was insulting not only his wife but also the King, Madame d'Orl√©ans' father. However, for the first time in his life, Philippe was seriously in love. Within a short time of their first encounter, Marie Louise was pregnant and installed in a pretty house near the Palais-Royal. After several years the Duke was forced to give her up as, the King maintained she was endangering the Duke's daughter's prospects of marrying the Duke of Berry (1713), a grandson of Louis XIV. His father had him legitimised in 1706 with the permission of his father in law then the reigning Louis XIV. His legitimisation was registered with letters patent at Versailles signed in July 1706; these were then registered at the Chambre des comptes on 18 July and the at the Parlement de Paris on 27 September the same year. He was brought up at the College of Jesuits in Paris. Under the direction of the Mar√©chal de Tess√©, Jean Philippe was named the G√©n√©ral des gal√®res (a sort of master of ships) in June 1716. At the death of Louis XIV in September 1715, his father Philippe d'Orl√©ans was named a member of the Regency council and the duc du Maine was named Regent of France. Philippe d'Orl√©ans had the will reversed and became Regent instead. The regency of Philippe d'Orl√©ans lasted from 1715 till the majority of Louis XV in 1723. This power, allowed his father to create him the g√©n√©ral des gal√®res on 27 August 1716. Jean Philippe remained the general till his death in 1748, when the charge was abandoned. His paternal grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Orl√©ans wrote of Jean Philippe; > My son has three illegitimate children, two boys and a girl; but only one of > them is legitimated, that is, his son by Mademoiselle de S√©ry, a lady of > noble family, and who was my Lady in waiting. The younger Margrave of > Anspach was also in love with her. This son is called the Chevalier > d'Orl√©ans. The other, who is now [1716] about eighteen years old, is an > Abbe; he is the son of La Florence, a dancer at the Opera House. The > daughter is by Desmarets, the actress. My son says that the Chevalier > d'Orl√©ans is more unquestionably his than any of the others; but, to tell > the truth, I think the Abb√© has a stronger family likeness to my son than > the Chevalier, who is like none of them. I do not know where my son found > him; he is a good sort of person, but he has neither elegance nor beauty. It > is a great pity that the Abbe is illegitimate: he is well made; his features > are not bad; he has very good talents, and has studied much. He is a good > deal like the portraits of the late Monsieur in his youth, only that he is > bigger. When he stands near Mademoiselle de ValoisMademoiselle de Valois was > his older half sister, future Duchess of Modena it is easy to see that they > belong to the same father. My son purchased for the Chevalier d'Orl√©ans the > office of General of the Galleys from the Marechal de Tasse. He intends to > make him a Knight of Malta, so that he may live unmarried, for my son does > not wish to have the illegitimate branches of his family extended. The > Chevalier does not want wit; but he is a little satirical, a habit which he > takes from his mother.,The Illegitimate Children of The R√©gent, duc > d'Orl√©ans, memoirs of the Dowager Duchess of Orl√©ans He was later created the Grand Master or Grand Prior of the Knights of the Order of Malta in France which had previously been filled by the Chevalier de Vend√¥me who had resigned. Vend√¥me was a grandson of C√©sar de Bourbon, illegitimate son of Henri IV. The registration of this position occurred with the permission of Pope Clement XI on 26 September 1719. He commissioned the artist Jean-Marc Nattier to decorate the Palais du Temple, the Parisian residence of the Grand Prieur. The 8 January 1721 saw Jean Philippe created the Abbot of the Abbaye Saint-Pierre d'Hautvillers dans la Marne, four months after the death of the previous Abbot, Monseigneur de Noailles. Jean Philippe officially became Abbot on 13 February 1722. According to contemporaries, he was very appreciative of religion, his father not being pious at all. During the Regency, Jean Philippe had a range of diplomatic missions on behalf of his cousin Louis XV. *He accompanied the infant Mademoiselle de Beaujolais (his legitimate half sister) to Spain when she was engaged to Infante Carlos of Spain in 1726. For this he was created a Grandee of Spain by Philip V despite the marriage between Beaujolais and Carlos never materialising. *On behalf of Louis XV himself, Jean Philippe went from Paris to Cannes, in southern France, to greet the newly created Duke of Parma; The duke was the previously mentioned Infante Carlos who was later King of Naples and Sicily and later the King of Spain; he married in 1738 to Maria Amalia of Saxony, the marriage with Mademoiselle de Beaujolais being cancelled and she dying in 1734 aged 19. Jean Philippe had one natural daughter, named Amable Ang√©lique de Villars, born in 1723, she was Jean Philippe's only child. Amable Ang√©lique was the daughter of Amable-Gabrielle de Villars (18 February 1706 ‚Äì 16 September 1742) who was in turn the daughter of Adrien Maurice de Noialles and Fran√ßoise Charlotte d'Aubign√©, niece of Madame de Maintenon. The married Amable Ang√©lique, was the wife on 5 August 1721 of the renowned homosexual Honor√©-Armand de Villares, 2e duc de Villars (4 December 1702 ‚Äì May 1770), by whom she had no issue. Amable Ang√©lique took de Villars name. He was wounded in 1744 on the Rhine and commanded galleys in the Mediterranean in 1746. He died in 1748 in Paris in his 46th year; he was followed by debts to the tune of almost 1 million livres.

In her early life, she contributed various pieces of prose and poetry to papers and magazines. In 1828, she married Prof. Charles Follen, who died on board the Lexington in 1840. During her married life, she published a variety of popular and useful books, all of which were characterized by her Christian piety. Among the works she gave to the press are, Selections from F√©nelon, The Well-spent Hour, Words of Truth, The Sceptic, Married Life, Little Songs, Poems, Life of Charles Follen, Twilight Stories, Second Series of Little Songs, as well as a compilation of Home Dramas, and German Fairy Tales. Holding an interest in the religious instruction of the young, she edited, in 1829, the Christian Teacher‚Äôs Manual, and, from 1843 to 1850, the Child‚Äôs Friend. She died in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1860. Early years Eliza Lee Cabot was born in Boston, August 15, 1787, the fifth of thirteen children in the prominent Cabot family of that city. She was the daughter of Samuel Cabot, and Sarah Barrett Cabot. She was well-educated. Career When Samuel died in 1819, ten years after her mother had died, Eliza Cabot and her two sisters established a household, and she developed a large circle of friends with literary and religious interests. Her friends included William Ellery Channing and Henry Ware. Within this circle, she co-founded a Sunday school affiliated with the Federal Street Church. Catharine Sedgwick introduced her to the educator Charles Follen. Nine years her junior, he initially became Eliza Cabot's prot√©g√©. In 1828, after his betrothed in Germany declined to emigrate to the United States, Eliza and Charles married. He perished on board the Lexington, which was burnt on Long Island Sound, January 13, 1840. Charles Follen After Charles's death, Follen educated their only son, Charles Christopher (born 1830), whom, with other pupils, she fitted for Harvard University. An intimate friend of Channing, she was a zealous opponent of slavery. Follen published the writings of Fran√ßois F√©nelon, and of her husband. Her writings also included: The Skeptic (1835), Sketches of Married Life (1838), and From Little Songs, for Little Boys and Girls (Boston: Whittemore, Niles and Hall; Milwaukie: A. Whittemore & Co., 1856). She edited two Sunday school publications, the Christian Teacher's Manual (1828‚Äì1830) and the Child's Friend (1843‚Äì1850). She was a voluminous writer. Her poems were first published at Boston (Crosby & Co.), 1839, and while she was in England, she issued another volume for children's use, entitled The Lark and the Linnet, in 1854. Both volumes also contain some translations from the German, and versions of a few Psalms. Her best known hymns are:‚Äî #\\"How sweet to be allowed to pray\\". (Resignation.) Appeared in the Christian Disciple, September 1818, and in her Poems, 1839, page 116, in four stanzas of 4 l., and entitled, ‚ÄúThy will be done.‚Äù #\\"How sweet upon this sacred day\\". (Sunday.) In her Poems, 1839, pages 113‚Äì114, in six stanzas of 4 l., and entitled ‚ÄúSabbath Day.‚Äù It previously appeared in Sabbath Recreations, 1829. #\\"Lord, deliver, Thou canst save\\". (Prayer for the Slave.) Found in Songs of the Free, 1836; but is not given in her Poems, 1839. In John Greenleaf Adams and Edwin Hubbell Chapin's Hymns for Christian devotion: especially adapted to the Universalist denomination, Boston, 1846, it is Number 802, in five stanzas of 4 l. In common with Number 2, it has found acceptance outside Unitarian collections. #\\"God, Thou art good, each perfumed flower\\". This is the original of J. H. Gurney's hymn, ‚ÄúYes, God is good‚Äù. There is some obscurity about the text. It is found in her Hymns for Children, Boston, 1825, beginning, ‚ÄúGod is good, each perfumed flower,‚Äù and this obvious misprint (which destroys the metre) was usually copied in later books. It is also given with the same first line as an original piece, never before published, and signed ‚ÄúE. L. C.‚Äù (initials of Mrs. Follen's maiden name), in Emily Taylor's Sabbath Recreations, Wellington, Salop, 1826, page 203. This suggests that it was printed in the American book after the manuscript was posted to England. Follen may have written at first ‚ÄúYes, God is good,‚Äù but this cannot now be determined. It begins, ‚ÄúGod, Thou art good,‚Äù in her Poems, 1839, page 119, and in her verses, The Lark and the Linnet, 1854, and in each case is in six stanzas of 4 1., with the title, ‚ÄúGod is Good.‚Äù #\\"Will God, Who made the air and sea\\". (A Child's Prayer.) Given in her Poems, 1839, page 164, in seven stanzas of 4 1. In Dr. Henry Allon's Children's Worship, 1878, Number 212, it is abbreviated to four stanzas (i.-iv.), and attributed to \\"H. Bateman\\" in error.

Between Fenelon Falls and Minden, Highway 121 served as an alternative route to Highway 35, which was severely congested during summer weekends. From Minden, the highway branched east to Haliburton Village and thereafter followed the present route of Highway 118 to Highway 28 in Paudash. Highway 121 was established in 1955, connecting to Highway 35 near Fenelon Falls and Minden. It was extended to Tory Hill via Haliburton Village the following year. 1956 also saw the discovery of significant uranium deposits in the Bancroft area, prompting the Department of Highways to construct a new east‚Äìwest route, Highway 109\\\\. It was built to connect Highway 503 (then 500) at Tory Hill with Highway 28 near Paudash; however, in 1964 it would be absorbed into the routing of Highway 121, bringing the highway to its maximum length of . The route remained unchanged until the mid-1990s, when government cutbacks led to a mass transferring‚Äîor downloading‚Äîof a significant portion of the provincial highway network. In 1997, Highway 121 was downloaded between its southern terminus and the community of Fell, north of Fenelon Falls, as well as from north of Kinmount to Highway 35 in Minden. The section between Fell and Kinmount as well as between Highway 35 and the eastern terminus of Highway 118 was downloaded in 1998, resulting in a common terminus with the latter. This was rectified in 2003 by renumbering the remaining length of Highway 121 as an eastern extension of Highway 118\\\\.  Route description  Burnt River in Kinmount. The steel arch bridge has been rebuilt many times, but retains its historic charm. Highway 121 was a route that connected several communities through southcentral Ontario. As it exists today, the former routing begins in the City of Kawartha Lakes at a junction with Highway 35 north of the village of Cameron. It angles northeast as Kawartha Lakes Road 121, travelling through farmland for before entering Fenelon Falls, a town centred on a lock on the Trent-Severn Waterway. Within Fenelon Falls, Kawartha Lakes Road 8 and Road 121 travel concurrently for , crossing the waterway and passing through the downtown area before curving east and exiting the town. At Northline Road, Kawartha Lakes Road 8 branches to the south, while former Highway 121 curves northeast, then north between Concession I and II of Verulam Township to Fell, at the northern boundary of the township. From here it veers east, then north between lots 18 and 19 of concession I in Somerville Township. The road winds north-east alongside the former Victoria Railway and the Burnt River to the village of the same name, which it bypasses to the southeast. At Somerville Sixth Concession (Hillside Drive, now Kawartha Lakes Road 44), the route again assumes and eastward direction. It turns north and follows the Bobcaygeon Road along the eastern boundary of Kawartha Lakes, north through Kinmount and into Haliburton County. From the Haliburton‚ÄìKawartha Lakes boundary, the route continues north along the Bobcaygeon Road into the undulating Canadian Shield as Haliburton County Road 121 to meet with Highway 35 immediately south of the town of Minden. The two highways travel concurrently along a bypass on the eastern edge of the town. Immediately south of the Gull River crossing, the route diverges east from Highway 35 as Haliburton County Road 21\\\\. Throughout the distance between Minden and Haliburton Village, the highway serves cottages along the northern shore of Kashagawigamog Lake. In Haliburton, the route encounters Highway 118, which continues east along what was formerly Highway 121 until early 2003. The route passes through a lake-dotted region to Tory Hill, where it encounters the Monck Road (formerly Highway 503), which provides a shorter route between there and Kinmount. Nearly to the east, drivers must turn to remain on the route, as the mainline continues north into Wilberforce as former Highway 648\\\\. The highway continues east, now following the Monck Road, through the communities of Cheddar and Cardiff. At the latter, the Monck Road departs to the northeast, while the highway continues east to Paudash, where it ends at Highway 28.  History  Highway 121 was first established in 1955, connecting to Highway 35 at both ends. In the south, the new route began at Powles Corners, and in the north it ended south of Minden, a distance of . This segment of the route was assumed by the Department of Highways (DHO) on May 25, 1955, the same day that Highway 35 was rerouted along the Fenelon Falls Bypass; the former route of Highway 35 into Fenelon Falls became Highway 121 and Highway 35A. The following spring, the route was extended east to a junction with the newly designated Highway 500 in Tory Hill. A short concurrency with Highway 35 was established around the east side of Minden. The DHO assumed this segment on March 7, 1956, extending Highway 121 to a length of . During the mid-1950s, large Uranium deposits were discovered in the hills west of Bancroft. The area experienced a boom between 1956 and 1964, prompting the DHO to construct two new highways east from Highway 28\\\\. One of these was Highway 109, which was designated (reusing the short-lived '109' numbering formerly on Eglinton Avenue in Scarborough) then constructed over the next couple years. Highway 109 was designated on March 20, 1958, from Paudash to the Monck Road west of Cardiff. It was extended further west on June 26 and September 25 by to meet with Highway 500, which later became Highway 648, south of Wilberforce. On March 1, 1964, Highway 121 was extended east to Highway 28 at Paudash, absorbing the length of Highway 500 from Tory Hill to the Highway 109 junction, as well as the entire length of Highway 109\\\\. This brought Highway 121 to its maximum length of ; it remained this way until the late 1990s. As part of a series of budget cuts initiated by premier Mike Harris under his Common Sense Revolution platform in 1995, numerous highways deemed to no longer be of significance to the provincial network were decommissioned and responsibility for the routes transferred to a lower level of government, a process referred to as downloading. On April 1, 1997, sections of Highway 121 between Cameron and Fell (near Fenelon Falls) and between Kinmount and Minden were transferred to the jurisdiction of Victoria County (now the City of Kawartha Lakes) and Haliburton County. Further downloads were performed on January 1, 1998, transferring the sections between Fell and Kinmount as well as between Minden and Haliburton Village. This resulted in Highway 118 and Highway 121 sharing a common terminus. The remainder of the route from Haliburton to Cardiff was renumbered as part of Highway 118 on May 1, 2003 Today, the former route of Highway 121 is known by various designations: Kawartha Lakes Road 121 in Kawartha Lakes, Haliburton Highlands Road 121 in Haliburton County south of Minden, Haliburton Highlands Road 21 between Minden and Haliburton Village, and Highway 118 between Haliburton village and Cardiff.

Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, he served as a city councilman in Berkeley, California, from 1971-73. Bailey was the founder of the National Civil Rights Museum which opened in 1991 at Memphis‚Äôs Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was slain in 1968. His 1993 book, Mine Eyes Have Seen: Dr. Martin Luther King‚Äôs Final Journey, focused on that period. A second book, The Education of a Black Radical, published in October 2009 by LSU Press, recalls Bailey's own history in the civil rights movement. His interest in civil liberties issues also led Bailey to film, where he portrayed a judge in the film The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). He had roles in seven other movies, including portrayals ranging from a minister to a street-hustling pool player. Bailey received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1967. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts in 2010. As a lawyer, he practiced for 16 years in Memphis before being elected as a judge in the Circuit Court of Tennessee's Thirtieth Judicial District in 1990. He presided over a nationally recognized trial lasting four months in 1999 in which three major tobacco firms were acquitted of wrongdoing in contributing to the deaths of smokers. He was twice nominated to serve on the Tennessee Supreme Court. In September 2009, Bailey retired from the bench and became a member of Wilkes & McHugh, PA,Wilkes & McHugh, PA official website, wilkesmchugh.com; accessed July 19, 2015. a national civil litigation law firm, founded in 1985 by Jim Wilkes and Tim McHugh. In 2014, he was again elected to the bench and returned to office September 1, 2014. Bailey lectured at law schools, including Harvard, Loyola in California, Washington and Lee, Washington University in St. Louis, and Notre Dame University. He published legal articles at the law schools at Harvard University, the University of Toledo, Washington and Lee, and Howard University. Bailey has served on the executive committee of the Tennessee Judicial Conference. Early years Bailey was born in South Memphis and grew up near Mississippi Boulevard. He attended the segregated Booker T. Washington High School from 1955‚Äì59, as Tennessee resisted desegregating its schools, as did numerous other southern states. Bailey attended the nation's largest historically black university, Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As president of the school‚Äôs freshman class, and for the next two years, Bailey was drawn into the fight against segregation. He joined actions such as a sit-in at a Greyhound bus station, picketing against discriminatory hiring practices at Baton Rouge businesses, and leading a march from the Southern University campus to downtown to support fellow students jailed for demonstrating. Bailey led a class boycott later, resulting in his expulsion. News of Bailey's ouster coursed through the civil rights community to Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, where sympathetic students had established a scholarship for a civil rights activist. The students raised $2,400 through community appeals, bake sales, and car washes to bring Bailey to Clark and continue his education. At Clark, he helped organize and became director of the Worcester Student Movement. He invited and hosted Malcolm X as a guest speaker at Clark, worked briefly with Abbie Hoffman in the Worcester leftist movement's early days, and interacted with such civil rights and student activist icons as James Meredith, John Lewis, Tom Hayden, and Allard Lowenstein. The Worcester Student Movement was active tutoring students from the city‚Äôs low-income neighborhoods. It also picketed against a downtown department store for not employing blacks as clerks, and organized demonstrations against a city manufacturing company. Bailey began to understand the power of law in advancing change as he assisted with the filing of legal complaints with the federal government to halt discrimination in the city. Political involvement, public service With his newly minted degree, Bailey worked in New York as national director of the Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, recruiting law students for civil rights legal work in the South. Later, he moved to San Francisco, California to practice law. He was elected to the Berkeley City Council, where he served from 1971-73. In the tumultuous politics of Berkeley, he pushed efforts to open new job opportunities and for expanding housing, recreational, and child-care programs for residents of the city next to the University of California campus. Eventually, he became ensnared in the divisive, politics that dominated Berkeley city government at the time, and he was recalled from the council in 1973.A History Lesson From Berkeley in the 1970s.  Page One from The Berkeley Daily Planet Memphis In 1974 he returned to Memphis, where he opened a law practice with his brother, Walter Lee Bailey Jr. In 1982 Bailey became part of a group of attorneys and activists who raised $144,000 to buy the Lorraine Motel, site of the King assassination. It had gone to foreclosure and was being sold at auction on the steps of the Shelby County Courthouse. A year later, Bailey made an unsuccessful run for Memphis mayor. He became more involved in working with others to preserve the motel and establish an civil rights museum there, organizing a foundation to raise money for this purpose. He served as the Board President from 1983 until the Museum opened in 1991. After lobbying to obtain public and private funding for the museum, Bailey resigned from its foundation board within months of the facility‚Äôs opening. Bailey said he felt fellow board members had lost sight of a central mission of the museum, which he felt was to inspire advances in civil rights. By then he had been elected as a circuit court judge. He said he envisioned the museum serving as a catalyst for activities aimed at what he said would ‚Äúcarry out the unfinished business of the civil rights movement‚Äù. The museum complex's exhibits trace the story of the struggle for African-American civil rights from the arrival of the first Africans in the American colonies in 1619 through the assassination of King in 1968. A 2001 expansion acquired new buildings for the museum, including the former Bessie Brewer's rooming house at nearby 418 South Main Street, where the shot that killed Dr. King was allegedly fired. In 2014, the main motel building re-opened after a major renovation that upgraded exhibits, adding many interactive elements, and building systems. Law career From 1976-83, he worked part-time for the Shelby County, Tennessee public defender's office, representing defendants in dozens of cases. During this period he also wrote a weekly opinion column for the Commercial Appeal newspaper in Memphis. He hosted a local television program, Memphis Forum, and has appeared as a legal and political analyst for Court TV. Before he was first elected as a judge in 1990, he had practiced law for 16 years in Memphis. His general law practice represented clients in criminal and civil cases. Much of his casework was in personal injury law. Bailey served three terms as president of the Memphis chapter of the National Bar Association. He was elected to three judicial terms and was twice nominated to serve on the Tennessee Supreme Court. After 19 years as a circuit court judge in Tennessee‚Äôs Thirtieth Judicial District, Bailey resigned Sept. 15, 2009 to resume a career as a civil trial lawyer. He focused on medical malpractice, nursing home liability, and catastrophic injury. Bailey joined Wilkes & McHugh, P.A., to take part in major cases with a firm recognized as a pioneer in nursing home abuse litigation. Film career A member of the Screen Actors Guild, Bailey had worked in film for three decades, including with such directors as Oliver Stone, Milo≈° Forman, Michael Hausman, and Jim Jarmusch. He described acting as ‚Äúhard work, but it's something different for me.‚Äù In The People vs. Larry Flynt, Bailey played a judge, in a film that included a supporting role by political consultant and pundit James Carville. Bailey appeared in Cigarette Girl (2009), set in 2035, a future in which cigarette smokers have been ostracized into ghettos called ‚Äúsmoking sections‚Äù and a pack of cigarettes cost more than $60.)

Whilst sometimes treated as a separate grape variety by ampelographers,Vitis International Variety Catalogue: Pinot Precoce Noir, accessed on November 18, 2009 there are nevertheless those who consider it is simply an early ripening form of Pinot Noir, and in some cases, Pinot Noir Pr√©coce wines may therefore be found straightforwardly labelled \\"Pinot noir\\".Hollywood Hill Vineyards, January 17, 2008: Fr√ºhburgunder As it seems highly likely that Pinot Noir Pr√©coce is simply a natural early ripening mutation of Pinot noir, it is extremely likely to have occurred and been selected and specially cultivated in many different Pinot growing regions (e.g., Burgundy, Champagne, Alsace, Loire, and throughout many older German vineyards) on many separate occasions throughout the long history of Pinot noir cultivation in Europe. Wines from Pinot Noir Pr√©coce are closely similar to, if not indistinguishable from, those of Pinot noir, and it is far from clear that anything distinguishes its wines other than oenological characters resulting from its early ripening (e.g., relatively fuller flavor development, lower acidity, and the like). Geographical distribution German Clevner wine from W√ºrttemberg made from Pinot Noir Pr√©coce. The early ripening of Pinot Noir Pr√©coce means that it is primarily popular in colder wine regions, and most of the current plantations are found in Germany. Up until the early 20th century, it was one of the most grown varieties in the Ahr region, but then declined to only in the 1960s, and was on the verge of becoming extinct due to problems of vine diseases. In the 1970s, the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute took an interest in it, and began selecting virus-free clones suitable for propagation.Wein-Plus Glossar: Fr√ºhburgunder, accessed on March 6, 2013Rheinhessen.de: Fr√ºhburgunder, accessed on November 18, 2009 The variety has thereafter had a modest revival in Germany, and in 2008 plantations stood at .German Wine Institute: German Wine Statistics 2009-2010 It also attracts some interest in new regions characterised by cool climate viticulture.

She was born to Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret, and his wife Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys, both of whom held court appointments. The couple were educated and frequently travelled with their growing brood of children to the continent. Charlotte, like her sisters, was well-educated; in 1746, she married the Hon. William Finch and had issue including George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea. An accomplished woman, Finch gained her appointment as royal governess in August 1762 upon the birth of George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte. Finch's duties included oversight of the royal nursery and all the staff employed therein, as well as organising lessons for the children. Finch oversaw the princes' education until they became old enough to live in their own households under the watch of governors, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. Finch retired from her role in 1793, though she continued to correspond with members of the royal family and receive gifts from them. Early life and marriage Lady Charlotte (right) and her sister Sophia, c. 1741 Lady Charlotte Fermor was born on 14 February 1725, the second eldest daughter of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret and his wife Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys. The growing family would come to include ten children: four sons and six daughters. Lord and Lady Pomfret held various court appointments during their lifetimes; the earl served as Master of the Horse to Queen Caroline while his wife was a Lady of the Bedchamber. Charlotte and her family were well travelled and sojourned to cultural and historical landmarks on the continent. While details on Fermor and her sisters' education are minimal, mention of them in contemporary diaries implies they were well-educated. She and Lady Pomfret were well-read and interested in theology; Charlotte's friends included the educated Elizabeth Carter. Charlotte was fluent enough in Italian for Horace Walpole to remark in 1740, she \\"speaks the purest Tuscan, like any Florentine\\" and \\"the Florentines look on her as the brightest foreigner that has honoured their [Accademia].\\" According to Walpole, Lord Granville, who had been briefly married to Charlotte's sister Sophia, was \\"extremely fond\\" of Charlotte; after Sophia's death in 1745, Granville gave his deceased wife's jewels to Charlotte, \\"to the great discontent of his own daughters\\". On 9 August 1746, Charlotte married the Hon. William Finch (1691‚Äì1766), heir to his brother Daniel Finch, 8th Earl of Winchilsea. Shortly after the wedding, Walpole reported that Charlotte had five thousand pounds from her father, a sum that would increase when \\"Mr Finch settles fifteen thousand pounds more upon her\\". William Finch had previously been married to Lady Anne Douglas but had no issue. He was a diplomat who served as envoy to Sweden and the Netherlands in the 1720s before becoming an MP for Cockermouth and Bewdley. Another of his roles, held from 1742, was to serve as vice-chamberlain of the royal household. He and Lady Charlotte had one son and four daughters together. One of their daughters died in 1765. Their only son, George, inherited the earldoms of Nottingham and Winchilsea from his paternal uncle in 1769. Royal governess Queen Charlotte and family, c. 1771‚Äì72. Lady Charlotte Finch is standing in the back, holding the baby. Lady Charlotte Finch's career as royal governess began in August 1762, when she was appointed a day after the birth of George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son and heir of King George III and Queen Charlotte. Walpole called the decision \\"a choice so universally approved that I do not think she will be abused even in the North Briton\\". Finch's biographer, Jill Shefrin, writes that the governess was noted for the skill she devoted to the raising of her own children, while Christopher Hibbert suggests that her educated background made her \\"well-suited\\" to the position. Lady Charlotte held the role of royal governess for over 30 years, and oversaw 14 of the king and queen's 15 children. She presided over the royal nursery, overseeing the staff members designated for each child; the staff included sub-governesses, teachers, personal attendants, and assistant governesses. She oversaw the princes until they became old enough to live in their own households, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. In the mid-1760s, shortly after her appointment, troubling developments began occurring in Lady Charlotte's home. One of her daughters died in 1765. Furthermore, William Finch, who was 34 years older than his wife, had by 1765 become senile and mentally unstable. Rumours circulated that he threw her down a staircase. Fearing for her safety, she obtained a formal separation from her husband, taking their children to live with her in an apartment at St James's Palace and a house in Kew. He died in late 1766. Despite these stresses on her personal life, Finch continued to fulfil her position with zeal. However, when another of her daughters became ill in early 1767, Finch took leave of her job and brought the young girl to various locales in the unsuccessful hope she would survive. Finch left the sub- governess Mrs Cotesworth in charge and returned grieving in November 1767, in time to care for the fifth addition to the nursery, Prince Edward. Educational approach and lessons Lady Charlotte has been variously described by biographers as warm, competent, and kindly. As was typical for the period, the children were infrequently seen by the king and queen; Finch was the unvarying adult figure in their lives. While the royal princes endured disciplined lessons in an austere educational environment, Finch was loved by her female charges. They affectionately referred to her as \\"Lady Cha\\", and upon returning from a trip to the continent in 1771, Queen Charlotte wrote her, \\"They can never be in better hands than yours\\". Shefrin says that Finch \\"supervised a progressive nursery focused on child-centred learning\\" and shared a passion for education with Queen Charlotte, as is evident in their correspondence and the writings of contemporaries; the idea of noble mothers encouraging education for their children ‚Äì a concept advocated by educators and scholars ‚Äì was becoming popular, and Finch's approach at court helped spread these new educational theories. Among the methods she employed was the use of \\"dissected maps\\", some of the earliest jigsaw puzzles, to teach geography. Historic Royal Palaces press release \\"Jigsaw cabinet\\" V&A; collection; Museum number:B.1:1 & 2‚Äì2011; puzzle cabinet The historian Flora Fraser writes that \\"in many ways, the education... ordered for the princesses would be as rigorous as\\" that which the king ordered for the princes. Queen Charlotte felt that a woman equipped with an education was as able as a man. An accomplished woman herself, Finch, alongside Mrs Cotesworth, organised lessons in the arts and sciences which were taught to both the princes and princesses. Subjects included geography, English, grammar, music, needlework, dancing, and art. A tutor, Julie Krohme, taught the children in the French language. Once old enough, the princesses would travel each day to receive their education at Finch's new house at Kew alongside the river. Conversely, the princes gradually saw less of Lady Charlotte as they became older and entered into the care of governors. The three eldest daughters of George III, 1784 In 1774, Mrs Cotesworth retired due to ill health. While seeking a successor, Lady Charlotte requested that she devote less time to the children. This was opposed by Queen Charlotte. The monarch felt that Cotesworth's resignation was partly due to Finch decreasing hours with the children, and also thought the other staff would be encouraged by Finch increasing her presence and \\"make them look upon it as a less confinement\\". Finch replied that she had regularly spent many hours with the princesses, both mornings and evenings, adding: > How can I without deviating from my own principles undertake an additional > duty of a kind for which I am conscious I am growing every day more unfit, > as your Majesty must know what an uncommon stock of spirits and cheerfulness > is necessary to go through the growing attendance of so many and such very > young people in their amusements, as well as behaviour and instruction, > besides ordering all the affairs of the nursery. Lady Charlotte threatened to resign so that the queen could hire someone \\"younger and more fitted for it\\", a declaration which ended Queen Charlotte's quest to increase her hours. Finch remained at her post.

Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, \\"I am grieved to death about her, she is if possible more kind to us than ever. Indeed, both [Mrs Gouldsworthy] and her are so good to us that we should not be deserving of having such treasures about us, if we did not feel their kindness in the highest degree\\". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with members of the royal family and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received ¬£600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace. She was buried in the family vault at Ravenstone, Buckinghamshire and five royal dukes attended her funeral. Her youngest daughter was allowed to maintain their apartments at St James's. Her will was mainly portioned out between her three surviving children. Her memorial by Francis Leggatt Chantrey (1820), is in Holy Cross Church, Burley, adjacent to Burley House, the Rutland mansion of her son, George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea.

The son of the secretary to Confederate President Jefferson Davis, Harrison studied law at Yale University and Columbia University before becoming a lawyer for the Southern Railway Company in 1896. By 1906 he was Southern's vice-president of finance, and in 1907 he helped secure funding to keep the company solvent. In 1913 he was elected president of Southern, where he instituted a number of reforms in the way the company operated. By 1916, under Harrison's leadership, the Southern had expanded to an network across 13 states, its greatest extent until the 1950s. Following the United States' entry into World War I, the federal government took control of the railroads in December 1917, running them through the United States Railroad Administration, on which Harrison served. An economic boom after the war helped the company to expand its operations; Harrison worked to improve the railroad's public relations and to upgrade the locomotive stock by introducing more powerful engines. Another of his concerns was to increase the amount of railroad track and to extend the area serviced by the railway. Harrison struggled to keep the railroad afloat during the Great Depression, and by 1936 Southern was once again showing a profit. Harrison retired in 1937, intending to focus on his hobby of writing about historical subjects including the roots of the American Thoroughbred horse, but he died three months later in February 1938. Background and early life Harrison was born in New York City on March 13, 1869, to Burton Harrison and his wife Constance Cary. Burton had served as private secretary to Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, and Constance Cary was a novelist.Davis Southern Railway p. 48 Harrison's brother, Francis Burton Harrison, was Governor-General of the Philippines from 1913 to 1921. Another brother was Archibald, and all three brothers attended Yale University. Fairfax Harrison graduated from Yale in 1890; he was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society.Yale University \\"Obituary Record of Graduates of Yale University Deceased during the Year 1937‚Äì1938\\" Bulletin of Yale University pp. 56‚Äì57 He went on to attend Columbia University, earning a Masters in Arts.Swem Library staff \\"Harrison, Fairfax\\" Special Collections Research Center Railroad career Early career Harrison was admitted to the New York State bar in 1892 and worked for the law firm Bangs, Stetson, Tracy & MacVeagh from 1892 to 1896. He then joined the Southern Railway Company in May 1896 as a lawyer, becoming an assistant to the company's president in 1903. He served as vice-president in charge of finance and accounting from 1906. During the Panic of 1907, Harrison successfully persuaded J. P. Morgan to purchase bonds in the Southern to keep the company solvent.Bryan \\"Fairfax Harrison\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography pp. 153‚Äì157 After the panic had subsided, Harrison was named president of the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railway, later the Monon Railroad (succeeded Ira G. Rawn after Rawn's death), which was jointly owned by Southern and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad.Davis Southern Railway p. 49 William Finley, president of the Southern Railway, died on November 23, 1913, and Harrison was elected as his successor eight days later.Davis Southern Railway pp. 51‚Äì52 Besides the chairmanship of the Southern Railway, he was also elected to succeed Finley on three subsidiary railroads.\\"Fairfax Harrison Elected President of Southern Ry.\\" The Wall Street Journal His election was considered to be a sign of change in the Southern United States, especially in its railroads, both because he was a southerner and for his activism on behalf of the south. First years as president One of Harrison's first acts as president was to implement a new training program for college graduates hired by the company. Rather than being placed in supervisory roles, they were given regular entry-level jobs in the engine shops and on the building and repairing of railroad track, to give them an understanding of the basics of the railroad business. He also instituted a remedial education program for the regular workforce; they were trained in mathematics and other subjects to high school level, as well as in engine and machine-shop basics. The program was designed to help train new supervisors in the skills needed to oversee other workers.Davis Southern Railway pp. 53‚Äì54 Another of Harrison's goals was to raise the morale of the workforce and locomotive engineers; crews were assigned to the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20 percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents. Harrison oversaw changes in the railway's Board of Directors. Until 1915 most of the members of the board were from the northern United States but, after 1915, a majority of the board members were southerners. In 1914 there were two unusual appointments to the board: Edwin Alderman and John Kilgo. Alderman was the president of the University of Virginia and Kilgo was a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church.Davis Southern Railway p. 55 Harrison established a foreign trade department for the railroad, hoping to take advantage of the railway's ability to connect to the Mississippi Valley and Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports. In 1915, when the railway lost 12 percent of its revenue owing to disruptions in trade caused by the start of World War I, Harrison was concerned about longer-term changes underway. In the annual report that year he warned stockholders that automobile ownership could severely impact railroad passenger revenues. His words proved to be prophetic, as automobiles eventually resulted in the disappearance of most passenger train traffic.Davis Southern Railway pp. 56‚Äì57 World War I A Southern Railway Pacific locomotive painted in the distinctive green and gold colors that Harrison introduced From 1913 to 1919, Harrison oversaw the extension of double-track on the railway's mainline between Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia. The project was hampered by the war effort, but eventually covered the complete distance between the two cities. In 1916, Harrison acquired a railroad line that ran from Meridian, Mississippi to New Orleans, Louisiana. This brought Southern Railway's track total to more than , covering 13 states. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, some military training camps were located in the south and much of the construction material used to build them was hauled over the Southern Railway. Harrison was elected chairman of a coordinating committee of railroad presidents, known as the War Board. Its five members were tasked with eliminating bottlenecks, and fostering cooperation between the various railroads.Davis Southern Railway pp. 58‚Äì61 The board's efforts failed to meet the government's expectations; in December 1917, Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, ordered the federal government to take control of the railroads, setting up a United States Railroad Administration (USRA) to run them. Harrison worked for the USRA during the war and, under its regulations, was required to step down as chairman of the Southern Railway. By the time the USRA returned control of Southern in March 1920 its treasury was bare. A few years of operation returned a surplus to the company, which led to the stockholders requesting in 1923 that the railroad pay a dividend to the holders of the common stock, something Southern had never done. Harrison managed to block the request, but in March 1924 a subsequent demand was successful, and a dividend of $5 (approximately $ as of ) per share was declared. That was increased to $7 (approximately $ as of ) per share in 1926 and $8 (approximately $ as of ) in 1928. 1920s Map of the Southern Railway's routes in 1921, shown as bold lines Harrison in 1927 An economic boom in the south following the end of World War I greatly increased Southern's revenues. Harrison spent a good deal of time traveling around the southern United States, endeavoring to increase southern industry. When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only one, which made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and observation area.Davis Southern Railway p. 62 Harrison attempted to increase the power of Southern's locomotives. In 1923, engineers under his direction created the plans for the P-4 class of Pacific type locomotives, which became famous and a symbol of the Southern Railway. On a visit to England, Harrison had seen the paint scheme used by the London and North Eastern Railway, which used apple green-painted engines. Returning home in 1925, he ordered the newly delivered Pacifics painted a forest green, which he called Virginia, with gold lettering and silver trim. The roof of each engine was painted brick red. These engines pulled the newly refurbished passenger trains that Harrison had begun work on before the war. He also instituted new passenger lines. In 1921 the Suwannee River Special began to run between Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland down to Tampa and St. Petersburg in Florida. The Crescent Limited began service in 1925 between New Orleans and New York, with a scheduled time for the one-way trip of 37 hours and 50 minutes.Davis Southern Railway pp. 62‚Äì64 Harrison continued the public relations and advertising efforts of his predecessors; in 1924 an advertising campaign was launched with the slogan \\"The Southern Serves the South\\", which soon became well known.Davis Southern Railway pp. 64‚Äì65 Harrison also spent long hours in negotiations to secure the legal foundations of the railway, consolidating the railroad's debt and acquiring majority control of some of the smaller lines that made up the railway.Davis Southern Railway p. 66 In 1926 the United States government forced the railroad to move out of its headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Although Harrison threatened to take the company headquarters to Atlanta, in the end a new headquarters building was built on McPherson Square. Harrison installed a private lobby entrance leading to a private elevator to the 10th and 11th floors. The railroad took occupancy of the building in the middle of 1929.Davis Southern Railway pp. 67‚Äì68 During these years, Harrison exhibited a number of personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine with him in the executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices. Great Depression Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Southern's stock sold for around $146 (approximately $ as of ), with an all-time high of just over $151 (approximately $ as of ). In 1932 the stock hit a low of $2.50 (approximately $ as of ). In 1929 Southern's freight traffic had been 8.4 billion ton-miles; it fell to 4.4 billion ton-miles in 1932. Southern's debt rose, and the company almost entered bankruptcy in 1932. Harrison ordered the payment of dividends to be halted in 1932, and many employees took pay cuts. Further efforts included a thorough check of expenses, with every item subjected to scrutiny to see what could be eliminated. By 1936 the railroad again showed a profit; this marked the turning point for the company in dealing with the Great Depression.Davis Southern Railway pp. 69‚Äì70 Harrison chose not to be reappointed as president in 1937, and nominated Ernest Norris as his successor.Time Magazine staff \\"South Server\\" Time Magazine Harrison, who was 68 at the time, planned to concentrate on his hobby of writing historical works, but he died three months after his retirement. Writing career Harrison was an author as well as an industrialist, writing on Virginia history and genealogy. Among his works were a translation of the agricultural works of ancient Roman writer Marcus Porcius Cato and several books on the local history of Virginia, including The Landmarks of Old Prince William, Devon Carys, Proprietors of the Northern Neck and Virginia Carys.

They also promote the engagement, empowerment and recruitment of underrepresented populations in health professions. Many programs devote significant resources to developing cultural competency training to promote the delivery of culturally sensitive healthcare by faculty and staff, as well as current and future healthcare providers. These services are usually tailored to meeting specific goals or missions of the individual components common in most of the operating Health Disparities Centers. History The Minority Health and Health Disparities Act of 2000, Public Law 106-525 led the way for an innovative program established by the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCHMD). This program, originally entitled the Project EXPORT, now bears the title of the NCMHD Centers of Excellence (COE) Program. The mission of this program is to develop centers of research, training, partnership and community outreach in the field and study of health disparities. Through grant support from the NCHMD, these centers contribute to scientific advancements and community programs with the aim of eliminating health disparities. Successful centers are currently operating in 31 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Many of these centers are made in partnerships with research-intensive universities, medical colleges and institutions, historically black colleges and universities, universities that serve Hispanic populations, tribal colleges and liberal arts schools. As of 2007, the NCMHD COE program had supported the development of 37 centers. Target populations It is a common misconception that Health Disparities Centers are tailored primarily for minorities, but in actuality their mission extends to a wide range of groups. These include age, gender, ethnicity, geographical location, language barriers, or any other differences related to socioeconomic status or environmental factors. However, the largest disparities are most prominent in minority groups. According to the Healthy People 2010 Objectives list of ten largest Racial and Ethnic disparities: *New cases of gonorrhea rank number 1 for Black non-Hispanics *Congenital syphilis ranks number 1 for Hispanics *Fetal alcohol syndrome ranks number 1 for American Indian/Alaska Native *Smoking by pregnant women ranks number 1 for Whites Organizational components Research component The focus and importance of addressing growing national health disparities represents a relatively new shift in health research. Both the NCMHD Research Endowment Program and the Community-Based Participatory Research Program are initiatives to promote awareness and research incentives for those interested in studying specific health disparities and the effectiveness of current outreach programs. Major research concentrations currently being studied include, but are not limited to, conditions such as HIV/AIDS, obesity, diabetes, specific types of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and child health promotion. A few examples of specific research studies that have been conducted through a partnership of Health Disparities Centers are as follows: *\\"Developing Measures of Parental Knowledge in Physical Activity\\", a study led by principal investigator Kitty Chan, PhD, was conducted through the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions. This study examined the parental knowledge of physical activity for health promotion in an effort to increase awareness in target populations where this knowledge may be lacking. *\\"Using Community Asset-Mapping in Health Disparities Research\\" conducted by principal investigator Veronica Parker, Ph.D. and her research team of the EXPORT Center at Clemson University involved a process called asset-mapping, which focused on community health strengths within specific areas serving poor, racial/ethnic minority and rural populations. The mission of this study was to identify these strong resources and engage communities to mobilize, preserve and utilize these faculties. *Cancer Disparities Research Partnership Program (CDRP) is a Cooperative Planning Grant for Cancer Disparities Research Partnership Program initiated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The focus of this program is to plan, develop and conduct research via radiation oncology clinical trials in hospitals serving disproportionately high numbers of patients from populations affected by health disparities. *The Diabetes Peer Counseling Study, currently underway at the Connecticut Center for Eliminating Health Disparities among Latinos (CEHDL), under the leadership of Rafael P√©rez-Escamilla and his co-principal investigators, Grace Damio and Jyoti Chhabra, is a new community-based intervention study. A major aim of their research is to establish a culturally specific diabetes management program that incorporates efforts of community peer-counselors and health professionals through a partnership with the Hispanic Health Council and Hartford Hospital and University of Connecticut. Education and mentoring component As disproportionate burdens of certain diseases and health conditions among specific populations are a growing concern, so is the need for widespread education and training for both the public and health professionals alike to be able to cope with, and prevent the occurrence of growing disparities in their communities. Health Disparities Centers across the nation are active in implementing educational resources that range from undergraduate and graduate coursework, postdoctoral training opportunities, conference or seminar series, and diversity and cultural competency training programs. Additionally, these centers are devoted to the recruitment and retention of research scientists and healthcare practitioners from racial/ethnic minority groups, people with disabilities and socio-economically disadvantaged individuals. Many institutions support faulty mentoring of underrepresented students who are interested in completing community-based participatory research on health disparities. Community outreach component The community outreach component of Health Disparities Centers provides the essential link between advancements in research and implementing significant findings directly into the communities being studied. Emphasis has also been placed on giving target populations affected by health disparities access to health information in a community setting where they feel comfortable to have sensitive health queries addressed. A major goal of Health Disparities Centers is to give the public the knowledge and encouragement necessary to empower them to promote a healthy lifestyle in their homes and communities and be proponents for their own healthcare. Health Disparities Centers also may partner with grassroots and community-based organizations that can serve mediums to disburse educational materials and provide valuable information about the needs of the community to the centers. Examples of successful community outreach programs established by national Health Disparities Centers are provided below. *Annual Health Fairs provided at Voorhees College for community residents allow attendees to receive health services and information. At these fairs, people can receive free information about nutrition, physical activities and general health-care. They can also receive blood pressure and blood sugar checks and learn about maintaining their body mass index. *The University of Florida, which is currently developing a new health disparities center, already has held numerous community outreach health and nutrition workshops and recently held its first annual Healthy Vegetable Cook-Off as part of Dr. Carolyn Tucker's Health-Smart Church Program. The event brought women from predominantly African American attended churches together to compete in an effort to create both the most delicious and healthiest vegetable dish. *The Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions has led the way with its innovative Project LIVE! outreach initiative. Project LIVE! is a collaboration between the center and the web-based organization, Poetology. The joint efforts have produced a compilation CD geared towards raising awareness about health disparities for young African American adults through a familiar medium. Administration component The administration component of numerous Health Disparities Centers is responsible for the oversight and management of all center initiatives and programs and ensures the fiscal responsibility of the institution. It is also common for the governing body of a health disparities center to manage grants and collaborative partnerships between the center and various university, hospital or community entities. Social justice implications Health Disparities Centers promote the concept of social justice which is a key facet of sustainability. The process of eliminating health disparities involves breaking language barriers, improving access to health-care, stamping out violence, and alleviating poor health conditions associated with a life of poverty. An example: *The VCU Center for Health Disparities will be holding \\"The First International Conference on Culture, Ethnicity, and Brain Injury Rehabilitation.\\" There is a communication problem between survivors and rehabilitation providers who speak different languages. The conference brings together experts from different countries to find an effective plan of action for better communication. Environmental justice implications Environment factors contribute to health disparities. Environmental justice refers to the burden that certain groups experience due to the physical environment that encompasses there day-to-day lives. People in different geographical locations may experience health disparities due to pollutants in the food or air, stress factors caused by their physical environment, and availability of different resources. Many health disparity centers have programs to promote a cleaner environment and healthy lifestyles, preventing disparities caused by the environmental. A few examples: *Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities: In 2005, the CRCHD started the Community Networks Program, which \\"aims to reduce cancer health disparities through community-based participatory education, training, and research among racial/ethnic minorities and underserved populations.\\" The CRCHD will implement this plan through training and educating individuals of communities where a cancer disparity is prevalent. They also plan to provide \\"evidence- based information\\" to local, state, and Federal lawmakers to inspire policy changes that reduce cancer disparities. *Hopkins Center for Health Disparity Solution ‚Äì The Hopkins center teamed up with Operation Reach Out SouthWest to hold a nutrition workshop. At the workshop, licensed nutritionist provide information on eating healthily by presenting alternative recipes and encouraging portion control.

It was released on 11 March 1994 by Butterfly Records. \\"Exorcism\\", like \\"Money Is Not Our God\\", failed to chart on the UK Singles Charts.  Background  In 1990, Killing Joke agreed to take a hiatus from writing studio material. Although the song \\"Change\\" was remixed by Martin \\"Youth\\" Glover in 1992, the band decided to take another year off until he was ready to return to the band. In an April 1994 MTV interview, after the release of Pandemonium, Jaz Coleman stated that he was \\"not together \\"walking the shores\\", if you like,\\" during the 10-year period of Youth's absence and the relocation to Iceland (see: \\"Empire Song\\"), saying, \\"I feel that the difference between now and the early days is we feel more focused, we feel more in control of our own destinies, if we want to put out a record, we put out a record. We don't ask for permission from anyone and we decide things within our own group as individuals.\\" In mid-1993, Killing Joke began writing new material, and in August of that year, they performed \\"Exorcism\\" for the first time live in Cairo, Egypt.  Releases  \\"Exorcism\\" was released in several versions including remixes and live performances. The original album version was not featured on any of the releases. The first release of \\"Exorcism\\" was a 10\\" and CD single, both on Butterfly Records, a label created by Glover. The A-side featured \\"Exorcism (Live in King's Chamber, Cairo August 1993 Mix) Edit\\" and \\"Exorcism (A Germanic Interpretation)(Unification Catastrophe-Full Length Mandra Gora Remix)\\", which was remixed by Mandra Gora (real name: Johann Bley).

In Ponce, he studied flute, but later abandoned it to focus on learning to play the piano. In 1884, when he was 17 years old, he traveled to New York, where he studied under pianist and composer Gonzalo N√∫√±ez and music master Frederick Doland, who taught him musical harmony. He quickly progressed in the development of his musical skills and in 1886 his parents sent him to study in France.Studied in France He studied piano and music composition under Georges Mathias at the Conservatoire de Paris and musical harmony and composition under Antoine Taudou and Louis de Serres, who had trained with C√©sar Franck. His onstage musical delivery met with positive reviews from the paper El Progresso and the magazine Le Courier des Etats Unis.Ar√≠stides Chavier Ar√©valo.

Professional debut Immediately after completing his studies, Chavier Ar√©valo taught piano while in France. In 1892, he returned briefly to New York where he taught piano for a year but, as he could not take the weather there due to health reasons, he returned to Ponce in 1893. While in Ponce he arranged successful musical presentations of his students to the public. In 1904, he submitted a group of his musical compositions for piano and orchestra to the Universal Exposition that was being held that year in St. Louis, Missouri, from 30 April through 1 December, and these were awarded a Gold Medal. In 1914, Chavier organized a far-reaching Musical Competition that was sponsored by the Liga Progresista de Ponce and held in that city that same year.Ar√≠stides Chavier Ar√©valo.

As a musician and music instructor, Chavier was admired by all as his technique was coherent and contained integrity. As a composer he created a vast library of compositions, mostly for piano and for string instruments. Unfortunately, most of his compositions were presented only in Ponce and were not internationalized. As a music critic and musicologist, Ar√≠stides Chavier published his essays in Puerto Rican papers of the times, and thanks to his fluency in French and English he translated many music writings from foreign publications into Spanish for the local public. While he did not dislike the then popular danza, he felt it should not be the only musical expression of the people and thus most of his musical productions were of a classical and modernistic nature. He created compositions for piano with two and four hands versions, for military ensembles, for orchestras and for string instruments.Ar√≠stides Chavier Ar√©valo.

History  Vingen is one of the largest rock carving sites in Northern Europe. The site contains at least 2,000 different carvings and prints dating back to 4000‚Äì2000 years BC. The figures are mostly of deer. There are also some other animal carvings, many other abstract geometric patterns and human figures. The site was discovered in 1910 by Kristian Bing, a lawyer from the city of Bergen. Kristian Magdalon Bing (1862-1935) was also a noted pioneer in the sport of mountain climbing. He was looking for a farm he could buy to commercialise the hydropower from the waterfalls in the area. In 1913, Kristian Bing bought the property. He retained rights to several large waterfalls but subsequently sold the site where most rock carvings are located to the Bergen Museum in 1923.  Current usage  Around 1,500 rock carvings have been found in Vingen, while around 500 others are scattered around at nearby Henn√∏y, Vingelven, and Fura. Various security measures have been set in place to protect the carvings from natural and anthropogenic influence. In 2002, the rock carvings at Vingen and the area around the site were closed to the public by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage.

Graydon Carter, managing editor of Vanity Fair, in his magazine's Editor's Letter, January 2005, titled \\"The Shots Seen Around the World\\", described Hollyman as a photographer whose \\"travels help form the patina of their characters and the grist for their tales.\\" Hollyman also worked as the Director of Photography for the 1963 film Lord of the Flies Education and early career The son of a Presbyterian pastor, Hollyman was born in Denver, Colorado on December 7, 1919. In 1919, the family moved to Warrensburg, Missouri, where his father became a church. In the sixth grade, Hollyman published a school paper. Hollyman later said that he \\"always wanted to be journalist\\". When he was older, Hollyman did typesetting at the Standard Herald newspaper in Warrensburg in exchange for lessons in news-writing. His school activities including being a bandmaster and a member of a novelty music show. As a high school senior, he worked his way to the United Kingdom on a German steamship, playing in a five-piece jazz band. Once in the UK, Hollyman bicycled from London to Edinburgh and back. While attending college at Central Missouri State University, Hollyman freelanced for The Daily Star-Journal and the St. Louis Post Dispatch, working with a Speed Graphic camera. On one job the Kansas City Journal sent him to photograph a married brother and sister. The young couple, separated at birth, did not realize that they were siblings until after their marriage. The photo of the young woman weeping in her doorway was Hollyman's first published photograph. He later remarked that the photo, \\"smeared over the front page of the Journal, syndicated nationally and ending up in Life Magazine, made me wince at my shameful effort even though it launched my career.\\" Hollyman graduated from Central Missouri in 1940 with a degree in English, economics and social studies. He obtained his master's degree in photojournalism from the University of Missouri, one of the first two graduates in that field. Hollyman's first job was with the Chicago bureau of ACME Newspictures, the forerunner of the wire service photography division of the Associated Press. He later became a staff photographer for the St. Louis Post Dispatch, where he worked until World War II. Air Force Intelligence In 1941 Hollyman entered the United States Army Air Forces and was stationed in The Pentagon to help set up a photo intelligence project. Among many other duties, he was assigned to be the official service photographer covering President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs funeral in Washington. He rode with the press corps on the president‚Äôs funeral train which slowly carried Roosevelt‚Äôs body overnight, to his interment in Hyde Park, NY. Hollyman served as officer in charge of Yank, the Army Weekly in Okinawa, and helped set up Yank and the Stars and Stripes newspaper in Tokyo. His USAAF colleagues included Herblock, the future political cartoonist, and writers John Hersey, Roger Angell, and Andy Rooney. Hollyman also photographed Nagasaki after it was bombed by the United States. Holiday Magazine After the war, Hollyman became the first staff photographer for Holiday Magazine, a position he held for several years. Working for director Frank Zachery, Hollyman produced over 1000 pages of travel journalism in Europe and the U.S for Holliday. IN 1946, Hollyman married fashion photographer Jean Burnes, who would and the two of them started working together on his assignments. They were among the first photographers to shoot small-format color photography for magazines. Hollyman eventually became the photo editor at Holiday. The couple's first joint assignment for Holiday Magazine came during their honeymoon in 1946, when they were sent to Bermuda. The new bride found herself stringing together a hard-wire cable necklace of some 40 flashbulbs to light up a seaside cavern for which the exposure was calculated manually. \\"We never worked so hard in our lives,\\" Burnes later told the Bridgeport Post. \\"We did thirty pages of pictures in two weeks flat.\\" For the next five years, the magazine sent Hollyman and Burnes on assignments in Europe, Latin America and the U.S. Advertising In 1950, Burnes left work to raise two children. Hollyman continued working freelance. The family lived in Weston, Connecticut, then moved to Puerto Rico in 1957. After advertising executive David Ogilvie saw Hollyman's photography in Holiday, he hired him to produce ad campaigns for Mercedes-Benz, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, P & O company and other accounts. Hollyman's 1966 photos of Pablo Casals walking down the beach in Puerto Rico with an umbrella won awards. In 1963, Hollyman and Burnes divorced. Lord of the Flies In 1963, Hollyman worked as the Director of Photography for the Lord of the Flies film. Hollyman had met director Peter Brook in Puerto Rico. Brook had come to the island to scout locations for the film. According to Hollyman, the two men had an extended but intense conversation about film, the Lord of the Flies novel, photography and even philosophy Brook hired Hollyman even though he had never used a movie camera. According to Hollyman, there was no artificial lighting; Hollyman shot the film in natural light in a rough documentary fashion, thoroughly non-Hollywood style...like news photography. Lord of the Flies became a critical success.

Its headquarters is located in Tallahassee, Florida and it has 90 local offices. Programs include Deaf/Hard of Hearing Services, Ticket to Work, Transition Youth, Mental Health, and Supported Employment. Program descriptions Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services ensure that VR services are provided to eligible individuals with all types of hearing loss. Necessary assistance and skills training for both employee and employer can help persons who are deaf or hard of hearing secure and retain employment. Ticket to Work is a Social Security Administration (SSA) program available to Floridians. For those who qualify for social security benefits, tickets will be issued and may be taken to Employment Network (EN) participants, such as VR. These participants offer access to employment and rehabilitation services necessary to help a person secure and retain employment. This program is voluntary. VR Transition Youth Services help students with disabilities train for a job, continue their education, or find a job after high school. Under this program, every youth will have the opportunity to participate in sponsored career counseling, work readiness training, and fully integrated work experiences in the community. These services are delivered while youth are still in high school. VR coordinates services with available mental health centers, programs, and service providers to assist individuals with mental or emotional disabilities in becoming employed. Supported Employment serves people with the most significant disabilities who have not been successful in competitive employment. The program helps individuals become employed in their community by using services such as job coaching and follow-up to promote employment stability. Examples of vocational rehabilitation services * Medical and Psychological Assessment * Vocational Evaluation and Planning * Career Counseling and Guidance * Training and Education after High School * Job-Site Assessment and Accommodations * Job Placement * Job Coaching * On-the-Job Training * Supported Employment * Assistive Technology and Devices * Time- Limited Medical and/or Psychological Treatment History The national vocational rehabilitation movement began after World War I when war casualties set the stage for Vocational Rehabilitation legislation. The U.S. Congress realized that many soldiers disabled in the war would require special training to return to civilian occupations. In 1918, Congress enacted the Soldier‚Äôs Rehabilitation Act to help veterans. However, the large number of people with disabilities from birth, accidents and work-related incidents that were in need of assistance stimulated Congress to pass the Smith-Fess Act of 1920. The act launched the civilian Vocational Rehabilitation program and provided funding to the states on 50/50 match. Vocational Rehabilitation evolved from a medical program serving veterans to an employment program that serves all disability populations. Florida‚Äôs Vocational Rehabilitation was established in 1925.

Based in the SIPBS department the professor took up his post with \\"a determination to strengthen links between faculties and with industry.\\" Originally Hunter graduated from Glasgow University with an honours degree in Biochemistry before undertaking a phD in Microbial Physiology (the study of how the microbial cell functions biochemically) again at University of Glasgow. The professor also works with the Scottish Qualifications Authority in creating the new Curriculum For Excellence Framework in Biology. Research The Faculty of Science has the largest number of research students in the University. The Faculty of Science collaborates with many external groups such as the European Space Agency, NASA, NHS Scotland, and the Metropolitan Police. Department Rankings Former Departments and Research Units  Centre for Digital Library Research  The Centre for Digital Library Research (CDLR) was a research unit based within the then Information Resource Directorate (IRD) and later the Department of Computer and Information Sciences.. It was established in 1999 by Prof. Derek Law, Head of the Information Resources Directorate, as a centre of expertise in digital library research and digital library development activities. It later contributed to the research portfolio of the Department of Computer and Information Sciences, including the Research Assessment Exercise and Research Excellence Framework . The Centre was disbanded in 2011 following organisational changes at the University of Strathclyde. The Centre was originally established to further the application of web technologies within the context of digital libraries thereby contributing to the development of national and global networked information services. This often entailed the concept of holistic approaches to system development whereby tangible technical outputs were interconnected and used to further research of a specific issue or problem . During its operation the Centre received numerous grants from a wide variety of funders, including the Jisc, the Scottish Funding Council (SFC), the European Commission, the British Academy, the New Opportunities Fund and others. A number of these grants, particularly those from the Jisc, funded the creation of service nodes within the Jisc's Information Environment , such as terminology services and federated search tools . Research specialisms for the Centre were varied but included topics such as digital content creation and maintenance, resource discovery, syntactic and semantic interoperability across distributed digital libraries and repositories, metadata schema, digitization and digital preservation . Although the Centre ceased operations in 2011, some of its technical outputs from research and development activities, such as the Glasgow Digital Library, remain available and supported by the University of Strathclyde Library. Perhaps the best known of the Centre's technical outputs was the BUBL Information Service . Originally predating the advancements in web searching offered by emergent services like Google, BUBL offered a searchable directory of specially selected and described web resources, covering all subjects of academic relevance for the UK higher education community. The directory BUBL operated was similar to the Yahoo! Directory but was instead organised, described and navigable according to the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system  See also  *University of Strathclyde *Strathclyde Business School *University of Strathclyde Faculty of Engineering References External links * Faculty Homepage * University of Strathclyde Homepage University of Strathclyde ","title":"University of Strathclyde Faculty of Science"},{"id":"25124217","text":"Our World with Black Enterprise is a weekly television show currently hosted by Paul Brunson, and, during its first season, Marc Lamont Hill which is produced by Black Enterprise, Inc.

The gap is traversed by Reno Monument Road. The Appalachian Trail also crosses the gap along the ridgeline. Geography The gap is about below the ridge line to the north, below the ridge line to the south and about above the surrounding lowlands. To the east of the gap lies the Middletown Valley and to the west the Hagerstown Valley. Turner's Gap is to the north, while Lambs Knoll is immediately to the south. History The area was settled in early 1751 by the John and Christiana Fox family and their son Frederick, German immigrants from Hesse. Frederick assembled adjoining lands which eventually extended to Turner's Gap. The area is first mentioned as \\"Foxes Gap\\" in a September 10, 1792 letter. Frederick Fox moved to Ohio in the early 1800s after the death of his wife. Fox's gap was in use by Euromerican colonists for decades before anyone settled there on the slopes of the mountain or gave it a lasting name though. This was the original, early route of what would be known as The Great Philadelphia Wagon Road. John MacGruder's 1732 patent along Catoctin Creek is described as ‚Äúabout 1/2 mile above the wagon road that goes from Connestoga to Opeckon‚Äù indicating the road being well established by that early date. The main migration wagon road would eventually be relocated to the center of the valley, but the Middletown to Sharpsburg route would remain in use as a local road over essentially the same road beds from the 1730s until present. The Daniel Wise family bought a portion of the property in 1858 for $46.96, clearing fields and building a log cabin. The Wise House was demolished in 1919. On September 14, 1862 the area was the scene some of the heaviest engagements of the Battle of South Mountain. The Reno Monument erected in 1889 by fellow soldiers at the top of Fox's Gap along Reno Monument Road commemorates the death of Union general Jesse L. Reno. Another monument has been erected nearby in the 1990s, which commemorates also the death of Confederate Brig. General Samuel Garland, Jr. and about a half-mile south is a bronze sculpture on a granite stone base dedicated in 2005 to remember the North Carolina troops that held the line here.

She was the niece of Fran√ßoise d'Aubign√©, Madame de Maintenon, and her heiress. Biography Fran√ßoise Charlotte was the only child of Charles d'Aubign√© and Genevi√®ve Pi√®tre, who were married on 23 February 1678. Because they were poor, her parents appealed to the future wife of Louis XIV, the marquise de Maintenon to help with her education. Maintenon agreed to help on the condition that Fran√ßoise Charlotte would be raised how Maintenon wished and would marry who Maintenon chose for her. As a result, Madame de Maintenon was later to make her brother's only child the heir to the Maintenon estate which she had owned since 1674. Madame de Maintenon arranged the marriage of Fran√ßoise Charlotte with a member of the powerful House of Noailles. Madame de Maintenon arranged with Anne Jules de Noailles, the father of Madame de Gondrin, future wife of the Count of Toulouse, for the marriage of Fran√ßoise Charlotte to his son, Adrien Maurice, Count of Ayen. The wedding occurred on 31 March 1698 when she was aged 13 and he was approaching 20. During the following 21 years their marriage produced six children. d'Aubign√© with her aunt, by Louis Ferdinand Elle the Elder c. 1688 Anne-Jules, the 2nd duc de Noailles, died in 1708 and then Adrien Maurice became the 3rd Duke of Noailles with Fran√ßoise Charlotte as his duchess. Later in 1718, after the death of Madame de Maintenon, she inherited the Ch√¢teau de Maintenon and her aunt's wealth, as promised. Thus, from very humble beginnings, Fran√ßoise Charlotte rose to the upper levels of French society. The Duchess of Noailles died in 1739 aged 55 but her husband lived for another 27 years, dying at Versailles at 88. Their two sons Louis, and Philippe, also went on to become marshals of France. The younger son, Philippe, was executed in the French Revolution in 1794, whereas Louis avoided this fate by dying in 1793 before the Reign of Terror was fully underway. Her nephew by marriage was Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi√®vre, one of the wealthiest man in Europe.

It awards a single grant of up to $1 million each year to a non-profit organization within Los Angeles County that helps children affected by disease, abuse, neglect, poverty or disability. The Foundation has awarded more than $15 million in grants that served over 1 million Los Angeles children. The Foundation was started in 1999 by Jacqueline Jacobs Caster. It relies on member dues to fund grants; Everychild members make a tax-deductible contribution. There are no fund raising events or paid staff, and low overhead. History Caster was dissatisfied with the use of charity events to raise their funds. The production of these events can consume large amounts of time and money while yielding relatively small returns. According to the National Center for Charitable Statistics at the Urban Institute, of the 102,353 public charities reporting special fund- raising events in 2005, the average return was slightly less than 40 cents on the dollar with $5.92 billion in total production costs and a net of $3.9 billion. Caster, a lawyer and urban planner, launched the foundation on a different model. It began with a membership of 56 women. In 2001, it issued its first grant for $230,000 to fund a mobile dental clinic operated by QueensCare, a nonprofit healthcare provider serving the indigent, and staffed by the USC School of Dentistry. By 2007, with 225 members, the Foundation issued its first $1 million grant, an amount which has been repeated every year since. Model The Everychild Foundation is organized as a 501(c) 3 nonprofit organization. Its intends to alleviate youth suffering in the Los Angeles metropolitan area by fulfilling needs of children that are unmet because of disease, disability, abuse, neglect or poverty. All funds of the Everychild Foundation are derived from its members who each commit $5,000 annually to the Foundation. The membership, which has had very low attrition rate (roughly 5%), is limited to 225 for efficiency purposes. Recruitment is primarily through word of mouth and small, member-hosted breakfasts. The primary work of the Foundation is the identification and screening of potential grantees and oversight once a grant is awarded. The Grant Screening Board is made up of 20 Everychild members who spend the year reviewing proposals and ultimately selecting two finalists. The process includes review of documents provided by the grant applicant, site visits, and analysis of the need for and viability of the proposed project and its budget. To prevent an entrenched group controlling the Foundation's grant process, committee terms are for three years and are staggered for continuity. The Foundation has two other major operating committees. The Grant Outreach Committee is responsible for contacting agencies that may have a proposal that is eligible for the Everychild grant. If an agency appears eligible, committee members work with it to help it prepare Letters of Inquiry, the first stage of the grant application process. Membership on this committee is limited to those who have already served on the Grant Screening Board. The Grant Monitoring Committee is responsible for monitoring the post-award status of funded projects. Under the terms of the grant agreement with recipient agencies, members of this committee visit the project site twice a year to assure that it is being implemented appropriately. There have been 15 spin off groups in the United States and Great Britain based upon the Everychild Foundation model. Other activities In recent years, the Everychild Foundation, through its policy committee, has become involved in policy issues in three major areas: support for infants and toddlers ages 0 to 3; advocacy for children aging out of the foster care system at age 18; and reform of the juvenile justice system. Activities include support for legislation in these areas and collaboration with other groups and agencies in efforts in these areas. The Foundation also holds Salons throughout the year for experts and interested members to discuss children‚Äôs issues in depth. These Salons have recently addressed the topics of autism, childhood asthma, and public education. Salon speakers have included former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Conner and Representative Henry Waxman among others.

He died in 1753, at the age of twenty-seven. Holt was not born into wealth, being described years later in the 1788 Clavis Campanalogia (a bellringing textbook) as \\"a poor unlettered youth\\", which could well account for his untimely death. By trade he was a shoemaker, but very little else is known about his personal life.  Ringing career  Although an underprivileged and illiterate working class member of society, John Holt became a very highly placed individual in the art of method ringing. Despite the fact that his ringing career spanned less than a decade, his contributions had incalculable impacts and he remains one of the most famous names in the history of the art.Trollope P125 In some respects, however, his ringing career remains almost as mysterious as his personal life. It is not known at which tower Holt learnt to ring, or who taught him. Most information about him is drawn solely from the records of the London ringing societies with which he was affiliated. Holt became a member of the Union Scholars bell ringing society in 1745. He took on a prominent role as conductor, conducting most of the society's peals before it became defunct. In 1752 he left the Union Scholars and became a member of the Ancient Society of College Youths, to this day a thriving company.  Compositions  It was possibly Holt's role as a conductor that got him interested in composing peals. As with his general ringing career, it is not known how he learnt the aspects of the art. Some of his compositions were recorded in the peal book of the Union Scholars. His chosen composition style in methods such as Grandsire Caters and Plain Bob Major is very similar to the compositions in these methods produced by his peers. In 1753 a broadsheet of four of Holt's Triples compositions was advertised for a subscription of five shillings and three pence. The document did not become available until the following year, after the composer's death, the delay possibly being a result of the objections made by Benjamin Annable, a leading London ringer. It is his peal compositions of Grandsire Triples that are among the most famous in the art of ringing, and are still rung frequently today. Composing a peal of Grandsire Triples is acknowledged as a complex theoretical task, undertaken by specialist composers. Such was Holt's genius, that his compositions of Grandsire Triples were completely unprecedented at the time of their publication. Virtually all composition achievements in the history of ringing have resulted from an evolutionary progression, where composers of one generation work on the foundations laid by their predecessors. Not only were Holt's Grandsire Triples peals groundbreaking, original, and uninfluenced from earlier composers' work, they also remained virtually unparalleled for over a hundred years; it was only in the second half of the 19th century that other composers began to discover the secrets of the mathematics of Grandsire Triples composition which had been known only by Holt prior to then. His two best known and most commonly rung Grandsire Triples compositions are Holt's Ten-Part and Holt's Original.Trollope P124  Holt's Original  Holt's Original is a one-part B-Block peal composition of Grandsire Triples composed by John Holt in 1751. It was the first true peal composition of Grandsire Triples to not function on the three lead course plan and to use only two singles. The composition contains 150 calls in total. The two singles occur as near the end of the composition as is possible, the first single being at the 357th lead, the second at the 360th (final) lead. Holt's Original was first rung at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 7 July 1751. Being of a one-part structure, the composition is a challenge to learn and conduct and has become the most popular memory challenge for conductors. Indeed, Holt himself conducted the peal from a manuscript whilst sitting in the ringing chamber when the composition was rung for the first time. William Dixon was the first person to conduct the composition whilst himself participating in the performance, a feat he achieved at St Michael's, Coslany, Norwich, on 22 August 1752. He successfully conducted the composition again two months later at St Giles, Norwich. A number of other one-part peal compositions of Grandsire Triples have been composed since Holt's Original, most notably Parker's One-Part which contains 90 calls, the minimum possible number.  Holt's Ten-Part  Holt's Ten-Part is a P-Block peal composition of Grandsire Triples composed by John Holt sometime between 1751 and his death in 1753. The composition is still considered to be one of the most intriguing in change ringing.Trollope 49 It contains 100 calls. Although described and conducted as a ten-part, the composition is theoretically a palindromic five-part which is split into ten sections. Five sections (the five first halves of each full palindromic part) form the first half of the composition, followed by the remaining five sections (the five second halves of each full palindromic part) which form the second half. The two halves of the peal composition are joined by two Holt's Bob Singles; the first halfway through the composition, and the second one at the end. To have the composition functioning as a 'perfect' palindrome five-part (where a total of ten Holt's Bob Singles would be required) is not possible, as the composition would finish after just one part. It is not clear when or where Holt's Ten-Part was rung for the first time. On 12 October 1754 the composition was rung at St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, and was claimed to be the first time of its performance. However, there had been two peals of Grandsire Triples earlier that year conducted by William Underwood which were described as having 'two singles', although there is the possibility that they could have been Holt's Original, or Holt's six- part composition. What certainly is clear is that Holt's Ten-Part became the most important composition of Grandsire Triples for well over a century. It provided more interest than the earlier peals on the three lead course plan, and it was an easy composition to learn and fairly easy to conduct. Parker's Twelve-Part, published in the later years of the nineteenth century, took over as the 'easiest' Grandsire Triples composition for conductors, and remains so to the present day. Other peal compositions of Grandsire Triples on a palindromic plan are fairly rare. Holt's six-part composition, published in the 1753 broadsheet, is on this plan but never became as popular as the ten- part as it was less easy to learn. in the 1880s Rev'd C D P Davies produced a palindrome ten-part similar to Holt's, with 150 calls. At the beginning of the 20th century, A J Corrigan published a palindrome six-part composition using ordinary Grandsire Singles. See also * Fabian Stedman * Albert J Pitman References * Trollope, J.

It was founded and is headed by Executive Director Arsham Parsi. It was set up on behalf of Iranian LGBT persons seeking safe havens both within and outside of Iran. It is the first Iranian NGO in the world, working on behalf of Iranian LGBT people around the globe. It has its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where the organization is registered as an NGO. IRQR provides assistance with asylum applications, housing, and financial assistance to those in need. It files petitions to governments on behalf of Iranian LGBTQ persons facing deportation back to Iran, where homosexuality is a criminal offense punishable by death. In August 2016, IRQR was granted charitable status by the Canada Revenue Agency. In November 2018, IRQR expanded its services to non-Iranian LGBTs and officially changed its name to the International Railroad for Queer Refugees. IRQR documents and reports cases of torture, persecution, execution and other human rights violations that occur in Iran on a regular basis; it has helped demonstrate the situation of LGBT persons in Iran. IRQR also aims to educate people who are opposed to homosexuality due to a lack of correct information and sexual education and also to \\"end the current lack of self-recognition and self-confidence among queer people and to prevent frequent tragedies, such as suicide.\\" The organization's name is inspired by the Underground Railroad that helped African-Americans escape slavery in the 19th century. The homepage of IRQR says: > \\"When Iranian queer people flee persecution in Iran, they generally go to > Turkey. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees interviews these > refugees and decides whether their case for asylum is valid. If they are > granted asylum status, the UNHCR finds a new country for each person on the > base of their profile. IRQR helps these refugees through the process and, > whenever possible, provides funds for safe houses from donations, since > Turkey is also a homophobic and transphobic society and queer people are not > physically safe there either.\\" In August 2008, Arsham Parsi, the IRQR's Executive Director, met with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Canadian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, regarding Iranian queer asylum seekers. Since that meeting, a number of asylum seekers have been granted refugee status or have been referred to the Canadian Embassy for their resettlement process. Furthermore, the UNHCR changed their legal interviews to an earlier date. As of December 2015, IRQR have worked directly with 1262 LGBT refugees from Iran, Afghanistan and Syria, helping them through their application process at the UNHCR and transition and settlement into Canada, the United States and other countries. The majority are from Iran; however, recently, IRQR has also offered its services to help Afghani and Syrian LGBT refugees. IRQR applicant count IRQR has been working with refugees for almost a decade. IRQR helps them in Turkey while they are going through the stages of becoming a Convention Refugee, and meeting with the UNHCR to advocate on their behalf. Without this, many refugees would have been forced to return to Iran. IRQR has maintained a success rate of above 80% in helping refugees through the process. Maintaining success rate above 80% annually is challenging with the significant increase in applicants since 2014; especially because the process time has changed from two to three years. IRQR successes rate In 2015, Arsham Parsi traveled to Turkey in February and September. He met with LGBT refugees to document their situation and provide services on the ground. He met with officials at the UNHCR office in Ankara to advocate for the most vulnerable and urgent cases in order to be granted for an expedited process. Because of IRQR work and the UNHCR, many LGBT refugees were granted an earlier interview and received refugee status, meaning they could begin their journey to a new home and being free to be LGBT. IRQR held five workshops in Denizli and Eskisehir, Turkey, in 2015 to help Iranian LGBT refugees whose cases were in process with the UNHCR.

Air echelon deployed to the CBI via the South Atlantic Transport route via Brazil, then across central Africa and Middle East to Karachi, India. Ground echelon traveling by ship across the Pacific via Australia. Once established in India, group aircraft made many trips over the Himalayan Mountains (The Hump) to Southeastern China from the Assam Valley of India airlifting gasoline, oil, bombs, spare parts, and other items the group needed to prepare for and then to sustain its combat operations. In addition to the B-24 heavy bombers, group utilized C-87 Liberator transports for logistical support. From its main base at Kunming and later Hsinching Airfield, the 308th carried out long range strategic bombardment of enemy targets in China in support of Chinese ground forces. The group attacked airfields, coalyards, docks, oil refineries, and fuel dumps in French Indochina; mined rivers and ports; bombed shops and docks at Rangoon; attacked Japanese shipping in the East China Sea, Formosa Strait, South China Sea, and Gulf of Tonkin. Received a Distinguished Unit Citation for an unescorted bombing attack, conducted through antiaircraft fire and fighter defenses, against docks and warehouses at Hankowon 21 August 1943. Received second DUC for interdiction of Japanese shipping during 1944‚Äì1945. Major Horace S. Carswell, Jr. was awarded the Medal of Honor for action on 26 October 1944 when, in spite of intense antiaircraft fire, he attacked a Japanese convoy in the South China Sea; his plane was so badly damaged that when he reached land he ordered the crew to bail out; Carswell, however, remained with the plane to try to save one man who could not jump because his parachute had been ripped by flak; before Carswell could attempt a crash landing, the plane struck a mountainside and burned. The group moved to India in June 1945. Ferried gasoline and supplies over the Hump. After the Japanese Capitulation in August, the group remained in India in support United States forces in the CBI. Personnel sailed for the United States in December, leaving B-24s to the colonial Indian forces. The unit inactivated as a paper unit in January 1946. Weather reconnaissance \\"From October 1946 through January 1951, served with Air Weather Service; supervised training and operation of weather reconnaissance units.\\" Strategic Air Command The group was once again designated as a bombardment group and activated on 10 October 1951 at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas. Under the wing base organization system, it was assigned to the 308th Bombardment Wing. However, Strategic Air Command's mobilization for the Korean War highlighted that wing commanders focused too much on running the base organization and not spending enough time on overseeing actual combat preparations. Under the plan implemented in February 1951 and finalized in June 1952, the wing commander focused primarily on the combat units and the maintenance necessary to support combat aircraft by having the combat and maintenance squadrons report directly to the wing. Deaile, pp. 175‚Äì176 The group was not operational and its squadrons were attached to the wing until 16 June 1952, when the group was inactivated with final implementation of this organization. Missile development In 2005, the Air Force relocated its Program Executive Offices at Air Force Materiel Command centers. The reorganization was known as the Air Force Materiel Command Transformation. In conjunction with the new organization, the traditional center directorates were replaced by wings and groups. The Long Range Missile Systems Group was formed as one of the new groups at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida in January 2005. In 2006 the 308th was consolidated with this group and the consolidated unit was shortly renamed the 308th Armament Systems Group.

According to witnesses and trackers, it was likely a wildcat, but its identity was ultimately not definitively confirmed. According to reports, the animal commonly crushed or decapitated its victims, which were mostly dogs. Deaths The first animal deaths possibly related to the Beast of Bladenboro were reported on December 29, 1953. Witnesses described a creature that was \\"sleek, black, about 5 feet long\\", which killed a dog in Clarkton, North Carolina, approximately eight miles from Bladenboro.('Vampire' Charges Woman, 1954) On December 31, 1954, two dogs belonging to a resident of Bladenboro were found dead with a significant amount of blood near their kennels.(Mystery Beast Slays Dogs of Bladenboro, 1954) Their owner reported that the dogs were \\"torn into ribbons and crushed\\". The following day, on January 1, 1954, two more dogs were found dead at a Bladenboro farm, and on the night of January 2, 1954, a farmer reported that a dog of his had been killed. Two more dogs were found dead on January 3, 1954. An autopsy was performed on one of the dogs and it was reported that \\"there wasn't more than two or three drops of blood in him [...] The victim's bottom lip had been broken open and his jawbone smashed back.\\"(Vampire Tendencies Found In Bladenboro's 'Monsters', 1954) Further deaths were reported in the subsequent days: on the night of January 5, 1954, a pet rabbit was found \\"cleanly decapitated and still warm\\",(The Beast Of Bladenboro - They All Know 'It'll Come Back', 1954) and on January 7, a dead dog was found in a pasture near the Bladenboro swamp.(Fresh Dogs Seek 'Beast' At Bladenboro, 1954) A goat was also reported to have died with its head flattened.(The Beast Of Bladenboro, 2006) Encounters and descriptions One local described the animal as \\"about four and a half feet long, bushy, and resembling either a bear or a panther\\", while another person described it as \\"small\\" and noted that there was \\"a little one just like it [...] running beside it.\\" Another local described hearing \\"a strange noise [...] like a baby crying\\". Though he did not see the animal, he estimated it was \\"close to 150-pounds, the way it went through the bushes.\\" Another account detailed in a local newspaper contained the following physical description: A group of hunters from Wilmington spent that night tracking the creature for three miles around swampland. According to them, the tracks showed claws at least an inch long and indicated an 80 lb. to 90 lb. animal. The beast's circling movement suggested it might have had offspring or a mate nearby, the hunters said. On January 5, the beast was witnessed attacking a dog which ran away and was not found. Tracks were seen along a creek bank near one of the attack sites; there were two sets of prints and one was smaller. Later that day, in the early evening, another resident described \\"a big mountain lion\\" near some dogs three houses down. The creature ran toward her, but turned and fled when she screamed. Outside her home, the tracks left in the dirt road were \\"bigger than a silver dollar\\" according to Police Chief Fores. A young boy named Dalton Norton reported seeing what he called \\"a big cat\\" on January 6, which \\"made a noise like a baby crying\\" on his porch before leaving. On January 11, two cars stopped for an animal reported to be four feet long. One of the men in the cars was quoted as saying the animal had \\"runty-looking ears\\" and was \\"brownish and tabby.\\"(Beast Takes Stroll; Frightens Autoists, 1954) Hunt for the Beast Luther Davis and Mayor Woodrow Fussell next to the bobcat Davis trapped On the night of January 3, Police Chief Roy Fores searched for the creature with his dogs, but they reportedly would not follow the trail.(Mysterious Beast Still At Large, 1954) \\"A half-dozen brave youths\\" and their dogs then spent January 4 searching for the creature, while that night, Fores and eight to ten other officers conducted their own hunt. Hunters who traveled to Bladenboro from Wilmington also searched for the beast that evening, reportedly tracking it for 3 miles around the swamp. On the night of January 5, more than 500 people and dogs hunted through the woods and swamps for the creature. On January 6, more than 800 people turned out to hunt for the beast in the swamps. Fores planned to tie up dogs as bait to lure the creature out, but this plan was not put into action. The hunt itself was also ended by officials due to safety concerns.(Hunters, Dogs Tracking Bladen Mystery Killer, 1954) On January 7, another 800 to 1,000 people gathered to hunt the creature.(Monster Strikes Again, Slays Dog, 1954) During the evening of the 8th, four fraternity brothers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were the only reported hunters. Mayor Fussell officially called off the hunt unless the creature made another obvious kill or there was a legitimate sighting. The armed hunting parties of previous nights had become too large for safety, and Fores received a telegram from a humane society in Asheville, North Carolina protesting his plan to stake out dogs as bait for the creature.(Vampire Beast Wins Battle Of Bladenboro, 1954) On January 13, Luther Davis, a local farmer, found a bobcat struggling with a steel trap in Big Swamp, four miles from the city, and shot it in the head.(Bladen Man Traps Bobcat; Is It The Ferocious Beast?, 1954) Woodrow Fussell, the mayor of Bladenboro, told newspapers that the beast of Bladenboro had been found and killed. However, it has been questioned whether such a small cat could have killed and mangled the dogs.(Gallehugh, 1976) On the same day, Bruce Soles from Tabor City was leaving Bladenboro when he hit a cat with his vehicle. According to reports, it was \\"spotted like a leopard,\\" about 20 to 24 inches high, and weighed between 75 and 90 pounds. He took the cat home with him to Tabor City. Yet a third man, \\"professional hunter and guide\\" Berry Lewis, is credited in some newspapers as having killed the animal. There were conflicting reports about whether it was Davis's or Lewis's cat that Mayor Fussell photographed and sent out to the press. Lewis was reportedly hunting in a different part of Bladen county when he shot and killed his bobcat.(Is The Beast Dead?, 1958) Speculation Many reported accounts describe the Beast of Bladenboro as feline, but do not agree on any one species. The animal has been described as \\"resembling either a bear or a panther.\\" Wilmington hunter S.W. Garrett also claimed to have heard the creature scream while hunting and likened it to that of a panther.(Guns, Dogs Circle Blood-Lusty Beast, 1954) Harry Davis, curator at the Raleigh State Museum, has said that a panther \\"never occurs in this country\\", and was of the opinion that it might have actually been a coyote. One local resident claimed the beast had tracks like those of a dog, but also said \\"I've never seen a dog that large.\\" Chief Fores was also reported as believing the beast to be a wolf. He said that \\"old folks say they remember seeing wolves in the bay-swamp area and talk about them every now and then.\\" C. E. Kinlaw described the creature as looking like \\"a big mountain lion\\" when it charged her on January 5. (\\"Mountain lion\\" is the term typically used west of the Mississippi for \\"cougar\\"). The game warden of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Sam Culberth, said that the tracks he investigated indicated a \\"catamount\\" (this is yet another name for a cougar). Other people described the animal as likely being a wolverine, while others speculated that the creature may have been a \\"wild police dog.\\"(Hunt Animal Blamed With Killing Eight Dogs At Bladenboro In Week, 1954) A. R. Stanton, a man from Lumberton, North Carolina, thought that the beast of Bladenboro was a German Shepherd and Hound mix named Big Boy that he gave to a Native American boy who lived along the edge of Big Swamp. Big Boy was dark and had a \\"long, bushy tail\\". Stanton claimed Big Boy was capable of leaping over a six-foot fence and killed chickens from time to time.(Thinks Bladen Killer Dog He Gave Indian, 1954) Lumberton veterinarian N. G. Baird said that it was \\"very feasible\\" that Big Boy was responsible for the attacks. Baird also said that it was possible Big Boy (or another dog) could have killed the other dogs and lapped up blood, rather than sucking it.('Vampire' Theory Fails To Draw Comment From Officer, 1954) Legacy Literature about the events of the winter of 1953-54 tends towards skepticism, particularly because of the publicity involved for the town through the sensational news reports. Mayor Woodrow Fussell, who operated the town theater, went to Charlotte, North Carolina on January 6 to book the film The Big Cat for a day.(Enterprise!, 1954) Fussell told an interviewer that he believed the creature to be a hoax, even though he was the one who called the Wilmington newspapers about the dead dogs. He found the manner of their deaths strange, and said that \\"a little publicity never hurts a town\\". A \\"one-arm sign painter\\" tailored his art to fit the sensationalism surrounding the incidents in 1954, making bumper plates proclaiming \\"Home of the Beast of Bladenboro\\". On the morning of December 15, 1954, on a tenant farm near Robeson Memorial Hospital, \\"five mediumsized pigs and three chickens\\" were found dead, with \\"crushed skulls [...] Three of the pigs had legs torn apart from their bodies. Strangely enough, no blood was evident, indicating the killer employed the same blood-sucking traits as the Bladenboro beast.\\"('Beast Of Bladenboro' Type Killer Strikes In Robeson, 1954) The next day, a stray dog was killed, which the County Dog Warden said was \\"most probably\\" the killer from the day before, even though the tracks found at the farm were not compared to the dead dog's, and it was not explained how the dog could have reached the chickens, which were reportedly roosting in a tree.('Beast Of Bladenboro' Scare Ends In Death Of Large Dog, 1954) Boost The 'Boro, a community booster for Bladenboro, holds an annual \\"Beast Fest\\" in which the Beast of Bladenboro (or \\"BOB\\") serves as mascot.

(search for all versions on WorldCat) Anna Elisabeth Louise was one of the few members of the royal house to remain in Berlin during the French occupation in 1806. While most of the royal family left, reportedly because of the anti-Napoleonic criticism they had expressed, and the members of the royal court either followed them or left the capital for their country estates, Elisabeth Louise remained with her spouse and Princess Wilhelmina of Hesse-Kassel because of \\"their great age\\", as did Princess Augusta of Prussia, who was pregnant at the time.

The colours are produced by the difference in speed in the fast and slow rays, also known as birefringence. When using the chart, it is important to remember these tips: *Isotropic and opaque (metallic) minerals cannot be identified this way. *The stage of the microscope should be rotated until maximum colour is found, and therefore, the maximum birefringence. *Each mineral, depending on the orientation, may not exhibit the maximum birefringence. It is important to sample a number of similar minerals in order to get the best value of birefringence. *Uniaxial minerals can look isotropic (always extinct) if the mineral is cut perpendicular to the optic axis (this situation can be revealed with the conoscopic interference pattern).

Horton (SCA No. 22 is referred to as \\"Proposition 7\\") Francisco v. Horton was an amendment of the Constitution of California that introduced, for the first time, the initiative and the optional referendum. Prior to 1911 the only form of direct democracy in California was the compulsory referendum.The Initiative Process Since the first state constitution was enacted in 1849, it has been obligatory for constitutional amendments and certain other measures to be approved by voters in a referendum in order to become law. Proposition 7 introduced a form of optional (or facultative) referendum on ordinary statutes. This means that a proposed law passed by the state legislature must be put before the electorate if a specific number of voters sign a petition requesting a referendum. The amendment also introduced the more powerful initiative procedure. This means that a certain number of voters can propose an entirely new statute or constitutional amendment, which then must be put to a vote of the people. Proposition 7 was part of the Progressive Era of reforms. On the same day voters approved Proposition 4, which granted women the vote, and Proposition 8, which introduced another instrument of direct democracy, the recall of elected representatives. Provisions Proposition 7 was approved by the California Legislature on 20 February 1911. It was ratified by voters in a referendum held as part of a special election on 10 October. The amendment altered the state constitution by rewriting and adding a long set of provisions to Article 4, Section 1, which dealt with the legislature. As amended, the section began, It continued, \\"the first power reserved to the people shall be known as the initiative\\" and \\"the second power reserved to the people shall be known as the referendum\\". The provisions on direct democracy have since been moved, and reworded somewhat. Today they are contained in Article 2.

October 11, 1914 ‚Äì Chapel Hill, North Carolina, July 26, 1992) was a scholar of medieval English literature and especially Geoffrey Chaucer. He taught at Princeton University from 1946 until his retirement in 1980 as the Murray Professor of English, and was \\"widely regarded as this [the twentieth] century's most influential Chaucer scholar\\". Early life Robertson studied at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1944. His dissertation on the work of Robert Mannyng, A Study of Certain Aspects of the Cultural Tradition of Handlyng Synne, was written under the direction of G. R. Coffman and Urban Tigner Holmes Jr. Subsequently he revised and published three important articles from it. Robertson taught briefly at the University of Maryland before joining the faculty at Princeton in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his career. Scholarly career Robertson's deeply historical approach to medieval English literature challenged and even angered many of the leading medievalists of the mid-20th century. Opposition to Robertson's critical approach at length took the form of a scholarly debate at the meeting of the English Institute of 1958‚Äì59. The book of papers published from that event proved that Robertson's \\"exegetical criticism\\", sometimes simply called \\"Robertsonianism\\", had many learned supporters as well as opponents.Critical approaches to medieval literature; selected papers from the English Institute, 1958-1959 (Columbia UP, 1960) Robertson's magnum opus was published in 1962 by Princeton University Press: A Preface to Chaucer. Studies in Medieval Perspectives, a massive work of 500 pages of text and 118 illustrations from medieval monastic manuscripts and religious sculpture and art. Critics were impressed by the extent of Robertson's reading in and grasp of primary sources, mainly in Latin and French, and secondary literature in every major European language as far back as the 19th century. Lynn Staley, Harrington and Shirley Drake Professor of the Humanities and Medieval & Renaissance Studies at Colgate University and one of Robertson's students, described it thus: :\\"His major study, A Preface to Chaucer (1962), challenged medieval studies when its tenets were increasingly influenced by the New Criticism; he insisted on the priority of primary texts in interpreting the hierarchical, Augustinian culture of the Middle Ages.\\" It was also intimidating to medievalists of his generation, most of whom had never seen any need to study the range of primary sources, particularly religious writings in Latin, which Robertson had mastered. As late as 1965, medievalist and folklore scholar Francis Lee Utley called it \\"a strange hodgepodge...insulting to the community of scholars and, indeed, to the Twentieth Century itself\\". p. 250 Scholarly supporters of Robertson's critical school gathered in March 1967 at the first annual conference of the Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies at State University of New York at Binghamton, an event often referred to among medievalists as \\"the Courtly Love conference\\". The volume of papers from this conference, published the following year, has retained its importance as a watershed in the spread of a new paradigm of the concept of medieval courtly love. Teaching at Princeton Robertson was a popular and engaging lecturer, and his seminars were usually full. Professor Staley has summarized his approach as follows: :\\"His gift for impersonation gave life to the dead: he could stage a conversation between John of Gaunt and John Wyclif as though he had been a fly on the wall, or recount Ovid's tales in a Carolina accent and with down-home details that made them as meaningful as they are slyly ironic. He insisted on the ways in which humor was fundamental to meaning. He shared his ongoing work with us, his moments of revelation, his tremendous interest in literature and cultural history. He insisted that we find proof for what we said in class or wrote in papers. He made it possible for me to learn in ways many professors might not have by giving me the freedom to chase my ideas through Firestone Library...He read the work we turned in quickly and willingly; he praised and criticized. The key to his approach was patience: he would not hound a student to finish chapters or to meet deadlines; you had to be self-directed, but Robbie met you more than halfway, and was quick to promote work he saw as significant.\\" Among Robertson's most important scholarly legacies is the number of his students among the prominent medievalists of succeeding generations. These include Robert P. Miller, Paul Olson, Chauncey Wood, John V. Fleming, Alan T. Gaylord, David Lyle Jeffrey, Marc Pelen, and Lynn Staley. Robertson retired from Princeton at the age of 65 in 1980. In his honor, Princeton University Press published Essays in Medieval Culture (1980), a collection of 24 of his essays. Among them are some of Robertson's bold attempts to extend the application of \\"Robertsonianism\\" beyond the confines of the Middle Ages: to Renaissance art (Leonardo), sixteenth-century literature (Sidney, Shakespeare's Hamlet), and beyond (Alexander Pope). Family Robertson married Betty McLean Hansen in 1937. They had one daughter, Susanna Howley, and two sons, Durant Waite Robertson III and Douglas Robertson. Retirement Robertson's research in retirement took him in the direction of the social historical context of literature, an interest he had occasionally expressed earlier. He did it so well that scholar Peter G. Beidler included one of Robertson's later essays, \\"Simple Signs from Everyday Life in Chaucer\\" (1981) in a bibliography of Marxist approaches to Chaucer. Robertson would be shocked, but also no doubt amused, at this gesture. Death Suffering from declining health, Robertson entered a retirement home near his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he died in 1992. Influence Alan T. Gaylord, Dartmouth College: :\\"Robertson's A Preface to Chaucer: Studies in Medieval Perspectives ... was and is, quite simply, the most important book on Chaucer in the twentieth century.\\" p. 320. Lee Patterson, Yale University: :\\"...Exegetics remains, apparently against all odds, the great unfinished business of Medieval Studies.\\" Steven Justice, University of California, Berkeley: :\\"Robertson shows something important. I have been suggesting that the last generation of medieval literary study could not trenchantly criticize Robertson's intellectual vices‚Äîand the habit of creating a kind of period subjectivity for the Middle Ages was the direst of these‚Äîbecause it practiced similar vices in different tones of voice. Of course, no one \\"stole\\" Robertson; it is just that anyone was apt to be embarrassed by thinking closely about him. But in this last inconsistency of his we can see one of his virtues and one of the reasons younger scholars, rediscovering him, have found a wealth of suggestiveness in his work (at least this is my impression) that their elders did not. His reading of Augustine here displays a counterenergy, a willingness to be surprised by the past.\\" p. 614. * 1961.

The village was located on several adjacent islands at the far northern end of the Froan island chain. They constituted the northernmost part of the string of islands north of Fr√∏ya, which stretch from Sula in the south to Halten in the north. Halten Lighthouse is located on the island of Halten in the central part of the fishing village. The fishing village primarily was located on the islands of Hus√∏ya, Halten, Steins√∏ya, and Rors√∏ya. A large breakwater was built to protect the harbour area of the village. The village has had no permanent residents since 1988, but during the summers there are many vacationers and tourists. History Halten Lighthouse The earliest written confirmation of human settlement on Halten is from 1548, and it shows a payment of a charge for access to the islands. However, it is believed that Halten has been made use of much earlier than that. In 1779, Henrik Borthen bought the Froan islands as a whole and the region remained in his family's possession until 1927 when a S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag agricultural company bought the islands from the family and set the land free. Tobias Ulrik Borthen was responsible for most of the expansion and upgrading of the village of Halten, from 1868 and up until World War I. Tobias Borthen built a dock and a big Tr√∏nderl√•n (Skankl√•na) which housed the local store and management and contained a radio station which was an important part of Haltens contact with the environmental society. At the peak of its activity, Halten was the biggest fishing village off the coast of Tr√∏ndelag, with as many as 1,000 inhabitants during the main fishing seasons. The population reached a point where a hospital was established on Halten, though it was scarce compared to today's standards. The decline in activity on Halten started when fishing vessels got more and more modernised and had cabins which eliminated the need for housing for the visiting fishermen. In 1963, Skankl√•na burned down to the ground, and that marked the beginning of the end of Halten as a community. In 1988, Torstein Erbo the current manager of Halten decided to shut down the fish delivery plant. The two last inhabitants left Halten in 1988. Present-day Halten Today there are no permanent inhabitants at Halten, but the area is used in the summers by many people who use the houses as holiday cottages. Halten is also an attractive destination for visiting tourists. The houses on Halten all have special names like: Vestindien, Banken, H√∏iskolen, Telemonhei, Minde, Klasbua, Sykehuset, Tempelet, Svana, Havna, Ostindien, Bakklund, Britania and many more. The third Saturday of July each year is \\"Haltenday\\", when r√∏mmegraut is served in Fiskarheimen (the old local community house) during the day and there is a folk dance in an old loft down on the dockhouse at night.

After issue #33 The Invincible Iron Man returned to its original numbering with issue #500. It concluded with issue 527, succeeded by the Marvel NOW!-imprinted Iron Man series. Story arcs \\"The Five Nightmares\\" (#1‚Äì7) Iron Man fights Ezekiel Stane, son of Obadiah Stane; who sought to avenge the death of his father by destroying Stark Industries. Ezekiel targets Stark by first becoming an international terrorist, using suicide bombers; with technology based upon the Iron Man. In an attempt to deal with the source of the devastation, Stark ventures into an A.I.M. facility and is faced with MODOG (Mental Organism Designed Only for Genocide), though after defeating him with ease and tossing his body into space; Stark realises another individual is responsible. Also targeted by Stane is Triumph Division‚Äîa group of seven superheroes originating from The Philippines; who are killed by a suicide bomber.Invincible Iron Man #2, August 2008 \\"World's Most Wanted\\" (#8‚Äì19) With his Extremis powers failing, Stark uploads a virus to destroy all records of the Registration Act, thus preventing Norman Osborn from learning the identities of his fellow heroes. The only copy remaining is in Stark's brain, which he is trying to delete bit by bit while on the run in one of his extra armors.Invincible Iron Man #10 As Osborn has him hunted as a fugitive, Stark travels worldwide on his quest to wipe out his mental database, going so far as to inflict brain damage on himself. When Osborn personally catches up to the debilitated Stark and beats him savagely, Pepper Potts broadcasts the beatings worldwide, costing Osborn credibility and giving Stark public sympathy. Stark goes into a vegetative state, having previously granted Donald Blake (alter ego of the Norse-god superhero Thor) power of attorney.Invincible Iron Man #19 During this catatonia, Pepper receives a holographic message from Tony revealing a way to 'reboot' his brain, returning him to normal. While Donald Blake and Captain America resolve to use this method, Tony offers to remain in his near brain-dead state, if it would make things easier for Pepper. \\"Stark: Disassembled\\" (#20‚Äì24) A message is displayed to Pepper by the armor in which Tony reveals there is a way to reboot his mind but offers to remain like that if it makes things easier. He also says Osborn cannot copy his or S.H.I.E.L.D. technology and that it will take Captain America, Thor, and himself to clean the mess Osborn will do once he goes crazy. Donald Blake (Thor) and Captain America (Bucky) decide to use it even though Pepper doubts Tony can come back when so many others cannot. Meanwhile, Madame Masque hires Ghost to kill Tony. In Stark's subconscious, he is trapped in a never ending loop where machines attack when he attempts to dig for something before the scenario resets. In his subconscious, a hallucination of his parents (Howard and Maria) help him find an iron chest which was what he was digging for. He puts it on but nothing happens. In the real world, Tony's recording outline how to reboot him, involving installing Pepper's electromagnet onto his chest, jack the hard drive Maria Hill recovered from Futurpharm into his head and then use Thor's thunder to boot his brain. However, when it happens there is no result so Doctor Strange is called in to help Tony come back while Ghost arrives only to fail. Tony's brain is successfully rebooted; however, the reset point was sometime before the Civil War, leaving Stark with no knowledge of the current status quo. \\"Stark Resilient\\" (#25‚Äì33) Justine Hammer unleashes the mechanical hero Detroit Steel on a world not ready for that much metal and chrome, and God help anyone that gets in his way. Tony keeps sifting through the ashes of his old life and tries to rebuild who he is and what he does. War Machine struggled to be a man of war in peacetime. Meanwhile, Pepper Potts is on the road to recovery, but nothing is free from complication in Tony Stark's world and that means the debut of an all new Rescue. The gang at Stark Resilient burns the midnight oil against an impossible deadline, but they're not the only one manufacturing a world-changer. Justine Hammer is building an army of bombers as air support for Detroit Steel. And all of Tony Stark's plans are in danger as the greatest foe he's ever faced is revealed. \\"Mandarin: The Story of My Life\\" (Annual #1) \\"The New Iron Age\\" (#500) \\"What It Was Like, What Happened, and What It's Like Now\\" (#500.1) \\"Fix Me\\" (#501‚Äì503) \\"Fear Itself\\" (#504‚Äì509) The machinations of the Red Skull's daughter, Sin, unleashed the long forgotten Asgardian god known only as the Serpent upon Midgard to fulfill an eons-old prophecy. His Worthy‚Äîeight mighty, mystically empowered warriors‚Äîspread fear in his name. With the planet seized by panic and chaos erupting worldwide, one of Tony Stark's oldest, most dangerous enemies stands transformed as one of the Worthy, and an unsuspecting Paris will pay the ultimate price. Now, Iron Man must fight a war on two fronts: one against the hammer-wielding Grey Gargoyle, and another against the soul-numbing dependency that has cost him so much. \\"Demon\\" (#510‚Äì515) Having regressed into drinking during the events of Fear Itself, Tony now finds himself forced by the U.S. Government to hand over his suit's biometric data, which would force him to relinquish his role as Iron Man due to evidence of his drunken state. Meanwhile, the Mandarin, Justine Hammer, and Ezekiel Stane work together in order to take down Stark Resilient, and Stark himself, while upgrading his old foes with new technology. \\"Long Way Down\\" (#516‚Äì520) As a result of Justine Hammer and the Mandarin's machinations, Tony is forced to wear a limiter, a device that can deactivate the Bleeding Edge armor at the discretion of a US Army general and Justine Hammer. He chooses to continue, still struggling with his alcoholism and sheer exhaustion. The armor itself is also pushed to its limits, still heavily damaged from the events of Demon, the cracked RT note drawing Mandarin's attention. Stark plays along with Justine Hammer's ploy and stages for Rhodey to 'die' at the hands of the Melter. In reality, this is the beginning of Tony's plan to strike back. Stark decides to take a leave of absence from the Avengers, having fought with Ms. Marvel and Captain America. Resilient is revealed to have been infiltrated by Spymaster, in the guise of Pimacher. Spymaster professes he has been impersonating him since Resilient began and tries to murder Cababa, choosing to make it quick as he was really in love with him. Stark enacts the next step in his plan to get back at his enemies by quitting being Iron Man. In order to have the limiter removed, Stark purges the suit from his body and replaces the cracked RT node. He then equips James Rhodes with a new Iron Man armor, with SHIELD, Oscorp, AIM and Stark Tech equipped. He denies any involvement with this new Iron Man and keeps his identity shielded from all, including Pepper. \\"The Future\\" (#521‚Äì527) Tony Stark is missing and finds himself captive in Mandarin City, along with various members of his rogue's gallery, forced to work on Titanomechs for the Mandarin. Stark later finds out his 'base code' was compromised by the Mandarin due to the backup drive used to restore him in Stark Disassembled being compromised itself. In captivity with him is Ezekiel Stane, who has gone from being the Mandarin's ally to his pawn. Slowly reversing the modifications the Mandarin has made to Zeke to make him more obedient, Stark plots his escape from Mandarin City, away from modern technology. As he works, War Machine, Pepper Potts and other allies of Stark look for him and launch the Stark Swarm, a computing platform on an atomic scale, powered by miniature RT nodes. While working, the Mandarin supervises him by hacking into his biology or flat out just torturing him and Zeke. Stark secretly patches the compromised code as the first step to his eventual escape from Mandarin City. Stark and Stane puts their escape plan into action and convinces the Blizzard, the Living Laser and the Whirlwind to join forces with them to escape Mandarin City. Stark completes his armor and they begin escaping. Stark is located by his allies due to his usage of the Stark Swarm and the Triumph Division and the Dynasty arrive to provide support towards the end of the battle. The Mandarin reveals the Titanomechs are designed to give a physical body to the spirits trapped in his Makluan Rings and plans to sacrifice the Earth in order to let the Titanomechs launch. The battle turns in Stark's favor as he weaponizes the Stark Swarm and uses it as a cannon to destroy the various Titanomechs. Stane kills the Mandarin and Bethany Cabe returns them to the United States. Upon returning, Stark is interviewed by Maria Hill and reveals how he was compromised. Stane goes missing, and Stark realizes that he is depressed and needs to clear his head. However, he later learns that Stane has gone missing and calls Justine Hammer to warn her. Stark theorizes that Stane and Sasha Hammer will assassinate Justine Hammer for betraying them to the Mandarin. However, Justine chooses to ignore Stark and is later assassinated by Sasha and Zeke in her car. Stark continues his return to operating publicly as Iron Man, using the Model 3 armor, having borrowed it from Avengers Tower. Stark repossesses both the Rescue and War Machine armors from Pepper and Rhodey to melt down into parts. He later reveals he has built a new Space Armor. The next morning, Stark tells the Resilient team that he is bored of the 'same old problems' and wishes to change the world and see new sights in order to obtain a paradigm shift. He apologises to the Resilient team, and promises to do better next time, before he launches into space. Awards The Invincible Iron Man won the 2009 Eisner Award for Best New Series.

They are affiliated to Cavan GAA. History The Killygarry club area as it now stands had a football club down the years before the formation of the present club in 1966 but these teams went out of existence. Still the Killygarry area produced many players for neighbouring clubs (and county too). There were schoolboy football games between Killygarry, Crubany, Castletara and Swellan played at venues such as Crowe's Rock or behind Fitzpatrick's shop. These were played several times a year and continued at various age levels to eighteen or so. Around the late 50s/early 60s a number of promising minor players were coming along and the idea of playing for a club team under the Killygarry name was tossed around. Enthusiasm was high and after a few meetings Killygarry GFC was born. Killygarry GAA Club was formed in 1966 when young football enthusiasts from the Killygarry hinterland who were playing with local teams like Lavey, Drumalee, Cavan Gaels, Laragh and Ballinagh, held a meeting in Killygarry National School. The first Chairman of the Club was Jerry Brady and he was assisted by Francie McDermott as Secretary. The Club entered the junior ranks and its first game in 1966 was against Cavan Gaels on Narrack's Hill. In the space of a few years the team worked their way up through the ranks. They won the Intermediate Championship in 1970 by beating Cootehill in the final. They were promoted to Senior and the following year 1971 saw them reach the Senior Championship final where they were defeated by the Crosserlough team of that time. On 8 May 1988, the Killygarry Athletic Grounds were opened in Crubany. The club went into the ‚Äò90s with similar expectations to that of the original team, winning the Junior title again in 1990 by beating Kildallan in the final. The Club also won many underage titles in the same decade. The next big win was in 1998 when they won the Intermediate Championship beating Denn in the final. They went on to achieve the double that year by winning the Division 2 League, beating Shercock in the final. The Crest Despite the club's existence since 1966, no crest was ever created, until after a local raffle to decide the crest in 2009. This new crest now sits on all Killygarry jerseys & merchandise. The crest incorporates the following elements: * The Irish name for Killygarry, \\"Coill na Garrai\\". * A picture to represent Coill an Gharrai. * A picture to represent Slieve Glah, which overlooks the grounds at Crubany. * A picture to represent a football which is the main sport played at the club. * The old Gaelic Athletic Association logo, to represent we are a GAA club. * The year the club was founded ‚Äì 1966. Killygarry Athletic Ground On 8 May 1988, the Killygarry athletic grounds were opened in Crubany. The grounds host a main field, a training field, gym, running track, four changing rooms, media room, large car park, shop and kitchen. Club Teams The Club contains teams from underage right through to senior level. There is an U-8, U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16, Minor,a Senior and 2 Reserve teams. The Killygarry ladies have an U-14, U-16, Minor & Senior Squads. The Kit Traditionally Killygarry have always worn red and black, hence the Nickname \\"The Red & Blacks\\". The Jersey is mainly red with black stripes on the sleeves and sides. The shorts are mainly black with red stripes on either side. The Socks are black with a red horizontal stripe on top.

For general information about interference, see Interference (wave propagation) or Interference patterns. A conoscopic interference pattern or interference figure is a pattern of birefringent colours crossed by dark bands (or isogyres), which can be produced using a geological petrographic microscope for the purposes of mineral identification and investigation of mineral optical and chemical properties. The figures are produced by optical interference when diverging light rays travel through an optically non- isotropic substance - that is, one in which the substance's refractive index varies in different directions within it. The figure can be thought of as a \\"map\\" of how the birefringence of a mineral would vary with viewing angle away from perpendicular to the slide, where the central colour is the birefringence seen looking straight down, and the colours further from the centre equivalent to viewing the mineral at ever increasing angles from perpendicular. The dark bands correspond to positions where optical extinction (apparent isotropy) would be seen. In other words, the interference figure presents all possible birefringence colours for the mineral at once. Viewing the interference figure is a foolproof way to determine if a mineral is optically uniaxial or biaxial. If the figure is aligned correctly, use of a sensitive tint plate in conjunction with the microscope allows the user to determine mineral optic sign and optic angle.  Creation of a figure  In optical mineralogy, a petrographic microscope and cross-polarised light are often used to view the interference pattern. The thin section containing the mineral to be investigated is placed on the microscope stage, above one linear polariser, but with a second (the \\"analyser\\") between the objective lens and the eyepiece. The microscope's condenser is brought up close underneath the specimen to produce a wide divergence of polarised rays through a small point, and light intensity increased as much as possible (e.g., turning up the bulb and opening the diaphragm). A high power objective lens is typically used. This both maximises the solid angle subtended by the lens, and hence the angular variation of the light intercepted, and also increases the likelihood that only a single crystal will be viewed at any given time. To view the figure, the light rays leaving the microscope must emerge more or less in parallel. This is typically achieved either by pulling out the eyepiece altogether (if possible), or by placing a Bertrand lens (Emile Bertrand, 1878) between the objective lens and the eyepiece. Any crystal section can in principle produce an interference pattern. However, in practice, only a few different crystallographic orientations are both 1. convenient to identify, to allow a figure to be produced, and 2. able to produce reliable information about crystal properties. Typically, the most useful and easily obtainable orientation is one looking down the optic axis of a crystal section, which yields a figure referred to as an optic axis figure (see below). Such crystal orientations are findable in thin section by looking for slices through minerals which are not isotropic but that nevertheless appear uniformly black or very dark grey under normal cross-polarised light at all stage angles (i.e., are \\"extinct\\"). If you are far from looking down an optic axis, a flash figure may be seen - a higher order birefringence colour, interrupted four times as the stage is rotated through 360 degrees by \\"flashes\\" of black which sweep across the field of view.  Characteristic figures of uniaxial and biaxial minerals  Sketches of uniaxial interference figures, viewed along the optic axis of each mineral. The colours approximate birefringence colours which might be seen if this were a mineral with second order maximum birefringence. The dark \\"maltese cross\\" pattern is characteristic of uniaxial minerals. Also shown are schematics of the shape of a cross section through the mineral's optical indicatrix (recording its refractive index in 3D) that would be seen at each position. The elongated direction could be distinguished by adding a sensitive tint plate to the microscope, letting the user discriminate between \\"uniaxial positive\\" (left) and \\"uniaxial negative\\" (right) minerals. An interference figure produced looking straight down or close to the optic axis of a uniaxial mineral will show a characteristic \\"Maltese\\" cross shape to its isogyres. If you are looking perfectly down the optic axis, the pattern will remain completely unchanging as the stage is rotated. However, if the viewing angle is slightly away from the optic axis, the centre of the cross will revolve/orbit around the central point as the stage is rotated. The form of the cross will stay constant as it moves. Possible interference figures for a biaxial mineral with a large 2V, viewed along one of its two optic axes. The curved shape of the isogyre is characteristic of biaxial minerals - though the degree of curvature will change as the microscope stage is rotated, and at some orientations the pattern will resemble the \\"maltese cross\\" pattern of a uniaxial mineral. The left hand image illustrates the figure alone; the grey patch at the centre indicates the low first order (grey) birefringence colours seen here (the order of the colours seen would in reality increase away from the center, but these colours are not shown). The two right hand figures show the effect of adding a sensitive tint plate to the setup, replacing the grey at the centre with second order blue and first yellow birefringence colours. The polarity of the yellow and blue reveals whether the mineral being viewed is optically \\"biaxial positive\\" (top) or \\"biaxial negative\\" (bottom), which can be a key property in identifying the mineral (or investigating its composition). The optic axis figure of a biaxial mineral is more complex. One or two curved isogyres (sometimes called \\"brushes\\") will be visible, one of which will have its point of maximum curvature perfectly centred. (The figure shows an example with a single isogyre visible.) If two isogyres are visible, they will be positioned back-to-back. Rotating the stage will cause the isogyres to move and change shape strikingly - moving from a position where the isogyres curve smoothly and are widely separated at their closest point, then gradually becoming more tightly curved/squarer at their midpoints as they approach each other (a second isogyre appearing from out of the field of view if it was absent before), then merging to form a maltese cross pattern very much like that of a uniaxial mineral. Continuing to rotate the stage will cause the isogyres to separate again - but into the opposite quadrants to where they were previously - then meet again, then separate again into their original quadrants, and so on. The isogyres will touch each other four times in one 360 degree revolution, with each time corresponding to one of the extinction positions seen in normal cross polarised light. The maximum separation between isogyres occurs when the slide is rotated exactly 45 degrees from one of the orientations where the isogyres come together. The point where the isogyres is most tightly curved represents the position of each of the two optic axes present for a biaxial mineral, and thus the maximum separation between the two curves is diagnostic of the angle between the two optic axes for the mineral. This angle is called the optic angle and often notated as \\"2V\\". In some cases, knowing the optic angle can be a useful diagnostic tool to discriminate between two minerals which otherwise look very similar. In other cases, 2V varies with chemical composition in a known way for a given mineral, and its measured value can be used to estimate ratios between elements in the crystal structure - for example, Fe/Mg in olivines. However, in these cases it becomes important to also be sure of the optic sign of the mineral (essentially, this tells you how the optic angle is orientated with respect to the whole optical indicatrix describing the refractive indices of the mineral in 3D). The optic sign and optic angle can be determined together by combining interference pattern microscopy with use of a sensitive tint plate. On either side of the \\"saddle\\" formed by the isogyres, birefringent rings of colour run concentrically around two eye like shapes called melanotopes. The closest bands are circles, but further out they become pear shaped with the narrow part pointing to the saddle. The larger bands surrounding the saddle and both melanotopes are figure 8 shaped. A Michel-Levy Chart is often used in conjunction with the interference pattern to determine useful information that aids in the identification of minerals.

In 1799 he took the degree of LL.D., and in November of the same year he was admitted into the College of Advocates. Obtaining a high reputation for business capacity and mastery of legal details, he rendered valuable service on several important commissions. He served on the commission appointed in 1811 to regulate the practice of the vice-admiralty courts abroad, and on that which was occupied from 1815 till 1824 in inquiring into the duties, offices, and salaries of the courts of justice and the ecclesiastical courts of England. His chief claim to distinction is, however, the part he took in the negotiations for the Treaty of Ghent with the United States in 1814 after the capture of Washington; he was one of the three commissioners sent to represent England, and was entrusted with the sole preparation of the despatches relating to maritime law, the most delicate and important part of the negotiation. In 1815 he was also named one of the three plenipotentiaries sent to conclude a convention of commerce between Great Britain and the United States, which was signed on 3 July. Excessive labour connected with the preparation of the case against Queen Caroline had serious effects on his health, and in 1825 he was compelled on this account to resign his profession. He spent the last years of his life in retirement at Thorpe in Surrey, where he died 11 June 1851.

Beginning as a mining camp near the Mayflower and other gold mines in northern Bullfrog Hills, it became a formal town in 1908 and flourished briefly until fire destroyed much of its business district in 1909 and litigation delayed mining. Population peaked at an estimated 2,500 in 1908, and the community survived at least through the closing of the Pioneer post office in 1931. Mining continued near the town site through 1941. Few remnants of Pioneer structures survived through the end of the 20th century. Geography Pioneer is on the north side of the Bullfrog Hills along Pioneer Road, a gravel road off U.S. Route 95. It is about north of Beatty, northeast of the ghost towns of Rhyolite and Bullfrog, and northwest of Las Vegas. Desert springs in or near the Oasis Valley of the Amargosa River are east of Pioneer. Donovan Mountain in the Bullfrog Hills rises to above sea level near Sarcobatus Flat slightly west of the ghost town, and the northeastern corner of Death Valley National Park is about further west. History Pioneer developed from a primitive mining camp near the Mayflower, Pioneer, and other gold mines on the north side of the Bullfrog Hills. These mines were part of the Bullfrog Mining District, which included mines on the south side of the hills in places like Rhyolite and Bullfrog. Industrialist Charles M. Schwab, who invested heavily in the Montgomery-Shoshone Mine near Rhyolite, also invested in the Mayflower in 1906. A Pioneer town-site company was formed in 1908 and began grading roads and selling lots. In that year, a daily stagecoach began making runs between Pioneer and the mining town of Springdale, about to the northeast along the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad. Another daily stagecoach linked Pioneer and Rhyolite in 1909 along a road constructed for the purpose. As the mines near Rhyolite declined late in the decade, some miners and businesses moved to Pioneer and in some cases took their buildings with them. A group of investors from Rhyolite and Tonopah bought the Montgomery Hotel in Beatty and moved it to Pioneer in February 1909, renaming it the Holland House, \\"the grandest building Pioneer would ever have\\".Patera, p. 15 Later that spring, Pioneer's population had grown to an estimated 2,500 occupying an estimated 300 buildings.Patera, pp. 15-16, citing Pioneer townsite agent J.W. Conlisk and an article in the Rhyolite Bullfrog Miner They included the town's post office, which the federal government approved in March 1909. In addition to the stagecoach, early automobiles ferried people back and forth between Pioneer and the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad station in Rhyolite. Water was available by the barrel from Springdale and Crystal Springs, to the southeast. For about five months in 1909, the town had two weekly newspapers, the Pioneer Topics and the Pioneer Press. Businesses in Pioneer included a drug store, a doctor's office, a barber shop, eating establishments, a liquor store, saloons, a meat market, a general store, a bank, and boarding houses, in addition to the Holland House. Just after the town reached its peak of development in March and April 1909, a May 9 fire destroyed much of the business district,Patera, pp. 19-20 and, although the town continued to prosper for a while, \\"the excitement would never be the same\\".Patera, p.20 The town rebuilt the business district and opened a school enrolling 44 students in mid-1909.Patera, pp. 25-28 Several mines with steady payrolls sustained Pioneer through the end of the year, but litigation slowed work at the Mayflower and other nearby mines, and the town's growth ceased. Fall enrollment at the school dropped to 24, and residents held a \\"Hard Times Dance\\" at the Holland Hotel at the beginning of 1910.Patera, pp. 55-57 Disputes about mine ownership led to further litigation, and the failure of the First National Bank of Rhyolite hampered investments in Pioneer. Stores began to close, and in August 1910, the Holland Hotel was sold to pay delinquent taxes. A shrinking population lived in or near Pioneer for many years, and the post office stayed open through early 1931. Mining, continuing in the area through the 1930s, was suspended in 1941, and did not resume on a large scale after World War II. As of 2004, little remained of Pioneer aside from \\"quite a bit of debris, levelled building sites, a few boards, and perhaps some foundations\\"Patera, p. 57 and, nearby, remnants of the Mayflower headframe and ore bin.

The ballpark was home to the Rutgers‚ÄìCamden college baseball team, and until 2015 was home to the Camden Riversharks of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. The naming rights were owned by the Camden-based Campbell Soup Company, which paid $3 million over ten years. Stadium demolition started in mid-December 2018. The park, located at Delaware and Penn Avenues on the Camden Waterfront, featured a commanding view of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge connecting Camden with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania across the Delaware River. Views of the Philadelphia skyline could be seen from the right-field grandstand and via \\"Campbell's Field Cam\\", a stationary weather camera broadcast on KYW-TV. History Ground was broken for the ballpark on June 15, 1999, with former New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman in attendance. Campbell's Field was funded by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, a loan from the Delaware River Port Authority, a grant from Rutgers University, and private financing obtained by the builder, Quaker Construction. During construction, the stadium was owned by the Cooper's Ferry Development Association. Upon completion, it became the property of Rutgers, which signed a lease with Camden Baseball, LLC to operate the stadium in conjunction with the Atlantic League. The new ballpark involved a $24 million construction project that included $7 million for environmental remediation costs. Prior to construction, Campbell‚Äôs Field was a vacant, undeveloped parcel of land that historically housed businesses that included the Campbell Soup Company Plant No. 2, Pennsylvania & Reading Rail Road‚Äôs Linden Street Freight Station, David Baird & Company‚Äôs lumber mill and Eavenson & Sons‚Äô soap manufacturing company. Campbell's Field opened in May 2001, and was one of the projects designed to spark urban renewal in Camden. The ballpark was honored in 2003 by DigitalBallparks.com and in 2004 by Baseball America as the \\"Ballpark of the Year.\\" Campbell's Field was honored with several local awards, including the Camden County Improvement Authority Entertainment Award in 2000, the International Masonry Institute Golden Trowel Award in 2001, the Urban Land Institute's Award for Excellence in 2002, the Downtown New Jersey Excellence Award, the New Jersey Business and Industry Association Good Neighbor Award, and the Distinguished Award for Engineering Excellence given by the Consulting Engineers Council of New Jersey in 2003. In April 2009, Campbell Soup announced that it would continue to have its name on the ballpark at least through 2020. In 2011 Campbell's Field is where the United States national rugby league team achieved victory in the Atlantic pool of 2013 Rugby League World Cup qualifying, booking the nation's first ever Rugby League World Cup appearance.Venue announced for 2013 World Cup Atlantic Qualifiers rleague.com, August 4, 2011 The stadium's financing totaled $35 million in loans and bonds from banks and various state and county public agencies, including the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (which issued a $7 million bond), the Delaware River Port Authority (a $6.5 million loan) and Rutgers University ($2 million). Threatened with foreclosure in 2015 amid millions of dollars in outstanding rental fees, the Camden County Improvement Authority (CCIA) acquired the property for $3.5 million and came to agreement on a 15-year deal with the team to repay the money through ticket surcharges, though the demise of the Riversharks later that year meant that only one payment was made towards that surcharge. While the stadium incurred annual debt service payments of $300,000, the facility brought in $100,000 in annual revenue, mostly from Rutgers University for rental fees for the Rutgers University‚ÄìCamden Scarlet Raptors baseball team to use the stadium as its home field.Duhart, Bill. \\"The downward spiral of a $21M baseball stadium built on taxpayers' backs, explained.\\", NJ.com, November 12, 2017.

He served from 1984 to 1992, a period which included the controversial MOVE police action and house bombing in 1985. Goode was also a community activist, chair of the state Public Utility Commission, and managing director for the City of Philadelphia. Early life Goode was born into a family of tenant farmers near Seaboard, North Carolina. After arriving in Philadelphia, he graduated from John Bartram High School and then he earned his degree from Morgan State University. He also graduated from the Fels Institute of Government at the University of Pennsylvania. Service with the Public Utility Commission After African-American state senators complained that there had never been an African-American member of the state Public Utility Commission (PUC), Governor Milton Shapp began actively searching for one. His aide, Terry Dellmuth, knew Goode from his community and political activities and recommended him. As a PUC commissioner, Goode met with community groups around the state, studied relevant issues, compiled what was seen as a pro-consumer record, and forged good working relations with his fellow commissioners. He was soon elevated to the chairmanship of the PUC, where he continued his pro-consumer policies but worked to limit PUC expenditures. Work in the Office of the Mayor Philadelphia Mayor Bill Green, who had been elected in November 1979, had promised to appoint a black managing director after winning a racially divisive Democratic primary against former deputy mayor Charles Bowser. Green kept his promise by appointing Goode as managing director at the urging of key members of the black community. Mayor of Philadelphia Before the primary election of 1983, Green decided not to seek re-election. Goode jumped into the race and defeated former Mayor Frank Rizzo in a racially polarized primary election. Goode went on to win the general election over former Green fund- raiser and Philadelphia Stock Exchange Chairman John Egan, the Republican Party nominee. Goode's tenure as mayor was marred in the spring of 1985 by the MOVE confrontation, in which police attempted to clear a building in West Philadelphia inhabited by a radical back-to-nature group whose members, under the leadership of founder John Africa, had long defied city officials by yelling slogans and statements from a megaphone, ignoring city sanitation codes, assaulting neighbors, and resisting law enforcement officers. During the final assault on the building, the police dropped an improvised bomb made of C-4 plastic explosive and Tovex, an explosive gel used in underwater mining. This caused the house to catch fire, and ignited a massive blaze which eventually consumed almost 4 city blocks, killed 11 people, and left 240 people homeless. In 1987 Goode ran for re-election, winning the Democratic primary before facing off in the general election against former mayor Frank Rizzo, who had converted to the Republican Party after losing the 1983 Democratic primary to Goode. Goode defeated Rizzo 51%-49% to earn a second term. Post-mayoral life Goode stayed active after leaving office as mayor by holding a position in the U.S. Department of Education. He earned a Doctor of Ministry at Palmer Theological Seminary, and became a minister and professor at Eastern University, as well as a leader of advocacy for faith- based initiatives. He currently serves as CEO of Amachi, a mentoring program for children of incarcerated parents. He was awarded the Purpose Prize, a $100,000 award given to exceptional individuals over age 60 who are working to address critical social problems.

Development The origins of the NB program are obscure, but design work began during the winter of 1941‚Äì42 with the OKB designation of aircraft T. The NB was a high-winged, twin-engined, twin tail monoplane of mixed construction. The fuselage was built of 'shpon', molded birch plywood, thick and was reinforced with a welded steel tube framework and a network of bracing wires in the midsection around the aperture for the wing and the capacious bomb bay.Gunston, p. 311 The single-spar wing was built from a mix of steel and duralumin.

The club has hosted several prestigious tournaments including the Rediffusion Tournament from 1963 to 1966, the Jersey Open on the European Tour between 1978 and 1995, and the Jersey Seniors Classic on the European Senior Tour since 1996. T History The golf course at La Moye overlooks Saint Ouen's Bay - here seen with Guernsey, Sark and other islands in the background The original golf course at La Moye was laid out by George Boomer in 1902, who was the schoolmaster of future British Open champions Harry Vardon and Ted Ray as well as his son Aubrey, after he had been turned away from Royal Jersey Golf Club. The course was redesigned by renowned golf course architect James Braid in the early 1930s, and was reopened by Vardon. The course was virtually laid waste during the World War II occupation of Jersey by the German Army. Major renovations took place during the 1960s and 70s under the guidance of Henry Cotton, and the course went on to play host to some of the world's top golfers as the venue for tournaments on both the European Tour and the European Seniors Tour. In 2011 Golf Course Manager Richard Cutler led the start of a major redevelopment of the course. It is due to be finished before Christmas 2011.
