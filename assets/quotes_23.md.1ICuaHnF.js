Family and home He was born around 400 in Bethelia, a small town near Gaza, into a wealthy Christian family of Palestine. What he has to tell us of the history of Southern Palestine was derived from oral tradition. He appears familiar with the region around Gaza, and mentions having seen Bishop Zeno of Majuma, the seaport of Gaza. Grandfather Sozomen wrote that his grandfather lived at Bethelia,Sozomenus, Historia Ecclesiastica, Bk.1, Chap. 15 near Gaza, and became a Christian together with his household, probably under Constantius II. A neighbor named Alaphrion was miraculously healed by Saint Hilarion who cast out a demon from Alaphrion, and, as eyewitnesses to the miracle, his family converted, along with Alaphrion's. The conversion marked a turning-point in the Christianization of southern Palestine, according to his account. The grandfather became within his own circle a highly esteemed interpreter of Scripture. The descendants of the wealthy Alaphrion founded churches and convents in the district, and were particularly active in promoting monasticism. Sozomen himself had conversed with one of these, a very old man. He tells us that he was brought up under monkish influences and his history bears him out.  Life and career   Education  Sozomen seems to have been brought up in the circle of Alaphrion and acknowledges a debt of gratitude to the monastic order. His early education was directed by the monks in his native place. It is impossible to ascertain what curriculum he followed in these monastic schools, but his writings give clear evidence of the thoroughness with which he was grounded in Greek studies. As a man he retained the impressions of his youth, and his great work later was to be also a monument of his reverence for the monks in general and for the disciples of Hilarion in particular.  Lawyer  As an adult he acquired training as a lawyer. He studied law in Beirut. He then went to Constantinople to start his career as a lawyer, perhaps at the court of Theodosius II. While thus engaged he conceived, around the year 443 the project of writing a history of the Church. Writings on Church history Sozomen wrote two works on church history, of which only the second one is extant. His first work covered the history of the Church, from the Ascension of Jesus to the defeat of Licinius in 323, in twelve books. His sources for it included Eusebius of Caesarea, the Clementine homilies, Hegesippus, and Sextus Julius Africanus. Sozomen's second work continues approximately where his first work left off. He wrote it in Constantinople, around the years 440 to 443 and dedicated it to Emperor Theodosius II. The work is structured into nine books, roughly arranged along the reigns of Roman Emperors: *Book I: from the conversion of Constantine I until the Council of Nicea (312‚Äì325) *Book II: from the Council of Nicea to Constantine's death (325‚Äì337) *Book III: from the death of Constantine I to the death of Constans I (337‚Äì350) *Book IV: from the death of Constans I to the death of Constantius II (350‚Äì361) *Book V: from the death of Constantius II to the death of Julian the Apostate (361‚Äì363) *Book VI: from the death of Julian to the death of Valens (363‚Äì375) *Book VII: from the death of Valens to the death of Theodosius I (375‚Äì395) *Book VIII: from the death of Theodosius I to the death of Arcadius (395‚Äì408). *Book IX: from the death of Arcadius to the accession of Valentinian III (408‚Äì25). Book IX is incomplete. In his dedication of the work, he states that he intended cover up to the 17th consulate of Theodosius II, that is, to 439. The extant history ends about 425. Scholars disagree on why the end is missing. Albert Guldenpenning supposed that Sozomen himself suppressed the end of his work because in it he mentioned the Empress Aelia Eudocia, who later fell into disgrace through her supposed adultery. However, it appears that Nicephorus, Theophanes, and Theodorus Lector actually read the end of Sozomen's work, according to their own histories later. Therefore, most scholars believe that the work actually came down to that year and that consequently it has reached us only in a damaged condition. Other writings According to historian and scholar of Islam Michael Cook, Sozomen wrote that a group of \\"Saracens\\" (Arabs) in Palestine had adopted Jewish laws and customs after coming into contact with Jews and may have been (according to Cook) the forerunners of Islam and Muslims.  Sources  Sozomen borrowed heavily from other sources for his work. The source for about three fourths of his material was the writings of Socrates Scholasticus. The literary relationship of those writers appears everywhere.For a recent discussion of their relationship see H. Leppin, \\"The Church Historians (I): Socrates, Sozomenus, and Theodoretus\\", in Gabriele Marasco, Greek & Roman Historiography in Late Antiquity, Brill, 2003, pp. 219-254. Valesius asserted that Sozomen read Socrates, and Robert Hussey and Guldenpenning have proved this. For example, Socrates, in I.x, relates an anecdote which he had heard, and says that neither Eusebius nor any other author reports it, yet this anecdote is found in Sozomen, I.xxii, the similarity of diction showing that the text of Socrates was the source. The extent of this dependence cannot be accurately determined. Sozomen used the work of Socrates as a guide to sources and order. In some matters, such as in regard to the Novatians, Sozomen is entirely dependent on Socrates. But Sozomen did not simply copy Socrates. He went back to the principal sources used by Socrates and other sources, often including more from them than Socrates did. He used the writings of Eusebius, the first major Church historian. The Vita Constantini of Eusebius is expressly cited in the description of the vision of Constantine. Sozomen appears also to have consulted the Historia Athanasii and also the works of Athanasius including the Vita Antonii. He completes the statements of Socrates from the Apologia contra Arianos, lix, sqq., and copies Athanasius' Adv. episcopos AEgypti, xviii-xix. Rufinus is frequently used. Instructive in this respect is a comparison of Sozomen, Socrates, and Rufinus on the childhood of Athanasius. Rufinus is the original; Socrates expressly states that he follows Rufinus, while Sozomen knows Socrates' version, but is not satisfied with it and follows Rufinus more closely. The ecclesiastical records used by Sozomen are principally taken from Sabinus, to whom he continually refers. In this way he uses records of the synods from that of Tyre (335) to that of Antioch in Caria (367). For the period from Theodosius I, Sozomen stopped following the work of Socrates and followed Olympiodorus of Thebes, who was probably Sozomen's only secular source. A comparison with Zosimus, who also made use of Olympiodorus, seems to show that the whole ninth book of Sozomen, is mostly an abridged extract from Olympiodorus. Sozomen used many other authorities. These include sources relating to Christianity in Persia, monkish histories, the Vita Martini of Sulpicius Severus, the works of Hilarius, logoi of Eustathius of Antioch, the letter of Cyril of Jerusalem to Constantius concerning the miraculous vision of the cross, and Palladius. He also used oral tradition, adding some of the most distinctive value to his work.  Publication  The work of Sozomen was first printed (editio princeps) by Robert Estienne at Paris in 1544,{ on the basis of Codex Regius, 1444. There are later editions by Christophorson and Ictrus (Cologne, 1612). A noteworthy edition was done by Valesius (Cambridge, 1720), who used, besides the text of Stephens, a Codex Fucetianus (now at Paris, 1445), \\"Readings\\" of Savilius, and the indirect traditions of Theodorus Lector and of Cassiodorus-Epiphanius. Hussey's posthumous edition (largely prepared for the press by John Barrow, who wrote the preface) is important, since in it the archetype of the Codex Regius, the Codex Baroccianus 142, is collated for the first time. But this manuscript was written by various hands and at various times and therefore is not equally authoritative in all its parts. There is an excellent English translation published in 1846 (London, Samuel Bagster and sons), translator unnamed, later reprinted and credited to Chester David Hartranft (1839-1914), with a learned though somewhat diffuse introduction, in the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, II (published New York, 1890).

It is the thirteenth installment of the series. Summary At the beginning of the novel, Jacen Solo is being tortured via the Embrace of Pain as he is overlooked by his captors, the Yuuzhan Vong and the mysterious figure known as Vergere. Vergere increases this pain by somehow robbing Jacen of the Force, but at the same time, she helps him through his agony by telling him to embrace, just like the Yuuzhan Vong do. Jacen does just as Vergere suggested, which pleases the Vong, represented by Nom Anor throughout the novel, who believe that in no time, Jacen will become just like them. Soon, nearly a year following the Fall of Coruscant, Jacen is transported to a Yuuzhan Vong seedship, where he is enslaved to a creature called a dhuryam. As this happens, he gains Vongsense, similar to how his late brother, Anakin, had sensed them with his lambent- imbedded lightsaber back in Edge of Victory: Conquest. The dhuryam is competing against other dhuryams to become the World Brain of the captured Coruscant, which has been renamed Yuuzhan'tar in honor of the Yuuzhan Vong's dead homeworld. As World Brain, the dhuryam that Jacen is enslaved to will have the responsibility and authority of everything technical on Yuuzhan'tar. Through more help from Vergere, who turns out to be a Force-user herself, Jacen forces the dhuryam to stop enslaving him and think of him as a partner; this way, the dhuryam would be more successful to be in consideration of being the World Brain of Yuuzhan'tar. As a result of this, Jacen's dhuryam indeed becomes more successful throughout various operations aboard the seedship. Eventually, the day comes when a dhuryam aboard the seedship will become selected to govern Yuuzhan'tar. Jacen uses this day to start a riot where Yuuzhan Vong and slave alike are killed, and he takes advantage of the chaos to kill off his dhuryam's opponents. When he decides to kill his own dhuryam, he sees the spirit of Anakin telling him to stop. Not knowing whether or not this was the real Anakin or a fabrication created by Vergere, Jacen's hesitation in killing the surviving dhuryam results in him getting knocked out. Jacen's dhuryam becomes the World Brain of Yuuzhan'tar by default, and Jacen wakes up on the captured Coruscant, realizing in horror what this newly transformed planet once was. Vergere leads him on a journey throughout the transformed world, and gradually, she shows him evidence that the Jedi's ideals of the Force are flawed; there is no light or dark side, but an overall power of the Force whose raw power is only considered to be of the dark side. Jacen refuses to believe this until Vergere leads him into a Yuuzhan Vong trap where he nearly kills all of them, including Vergere herself. Jacen is shocked at just how right Vergere is, even after she revealed previously that she was once a member of the previous Jedi Order. But eventually, Jacen comes to accept the Yuuzhan Vong's ways as they give him the late Anakin Solo's lightsaber, which is considered a holy relic to the Vong due to its imbedded lambent crystal. Jedi Knight Ganner Rhysode has spent much time searching the galaxy trying to find Jacen, being one of the few who believe that he is still alive. He comes into contact with Jacen and an entourage of Yuuzhan Vong infiltrators aboard a New Republic refugee ship, and Ganner is captured due to his Jedi nature. He is taken to Yuuzhan'tar in order to be converted to their ways like Jacen. But as it turns out, Jacen had feigned loyalty to the Vong so that he could get close to the World Brain. The plan works as both he and Ganner are allowed admittance into the Well of the World Brain, although Nom Anor knows that they were faking their obedience to the Yuuzhan Vong. Knowing that Jacen won't have time to do whatever he wants to the World Brain, Ganner takes Jacen's lightsaber and decides to take on every Yuuzhan Vong warrior at the Well of the World Brain, vowing that not one of them will ever pass. Ganner fights every Vong warrior to the death, but in the end, he is so mortally wounded that he brings down the hall of the Well of the World Brain on top of himself and every surviving Vong with him. Meanwhile, as the battle commenced, Nom Anor looked to Vergere to escape the disaster, and Vergere tricks him into revealing his escape craft. Vergere then coerces the Vong plant life around them to tie up Nom Anor so that she and Jacen could escape Yuuzhan'tar. Meanwhile, Jacen concludes his business with the World Brain, and he and Vergere leave. As they travel back to the New Republic, Jacen reveals to Vergere that he convinced the World Brain to teach the Yuuzhan Vong the concept of compromise; the brain will cause problems throughout the Vong's occupation of the world so that for once, the invaders will know that not everything will ever be perfect for them. Vergere applauds Jacen for applying what she taught him throughout the novel to the World Brain.

His feast day in the Orthodox Church is February 21. Life He was a native of Side in Pamphylia. About 320 he was bishop of Beroea, and he became patriarch of Antioch shortly before the Council of Nicaea in 325. In that assembly he distinguished himself zealously against the Arians, though the Allocutio ad Imperatorem with which he has been credited is probably not by him. His anti-Arian polemic against Eusebius of Nicomedia made him unpopular among his fellow bishops in the East, and a synod convened at Antioch in 330 deposed him for adultery,Philostorgius, in Photius, Epitome of the Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, book 2, chapter 7. which was confirmed by the emperor. In the dispute with Eustathius of Antioch, who opposed the growing influence of Origen and his practice of an allegorical exegesis of scripture, seeing in his theology the roots of Arianism, Eusebius, an admirer of Origen, was reproached by Eustathius for deviating from the Nicene faith, who was charged in turn with Sabellianism. Eustathius was accused, condemned, and deposed at a synod in Antioch. The people of Antioch rebelled against this action,Eusebius 'Life of Constantine' III.49 while the anti-Eustathians proposed Eusebius as the new bishop, but he declined. He was banished to Trajanopolis in Thrace, where he died, probably about 337, though possibly not until 370. The people of Antioch, who loved and revered their patriarch, became indignant at the injustice done to him and were ready to take up arms in his defence. But Eustathius kept them in check, exhorted them to remain true to the orthodox faith and humbly left for his place of exile, accompanied by a large body of his clergy. His adherents in Antioch formed a separate community by the name of \\"Eustathians\\" and refused to acknowledge the bishops set over them by the Arians. When, after the death of Eustathius, St. Meletius became Bishop of Antioch in 360 by the united vote of the Arians and the orthodox, the Eustathians would not recognize him, even after his election was approved by the Synod of Alexandria in 362. Their intransigent attitude gave rise to two factions among the orthodox, the so- called Meletian Schism, which lasted till the second decade of the fifth century.Ott, Michael. \\"St. Eustathius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5.

Although the Court did not touch on the constitutionality of the exclusion of people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast‚Äîwhich they had found not to violate citizen rights in their Korematsu v. United States decision on the same date‚Äîthe Endo ruling nonetheless led to the reopening of the West Coast to Japanese Americans after their incarceration in camps across the U.S. interior during World War II. The Court also found as part of this decision that, if Congress is found to have ratified by appropriation any part of an executive agency program, the bill doing so must include a specific item referring to that portion of the program. Background The plaintiff in the case, Mitsuye Endo, had worked as a clerk for the California Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento prior to the war. After the attack on Pearl Harbor soured public sentiment toward Japanese Americans, Endo and other Nisei state employees were harassed and eventually fired because of their Japanese ancestry.Brian Niiya. \\"Ex parte Endo\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 5 June 2014). Civil rights attorney and then-president of the Japanese American Citizens League Saburo Kido, with San Francisco attorney James Purcell, began a legal campaign to assist these workers, but the mass removal authorized by Executive Order 9066 in early 1942 complicated their case. Endo was selected as a test case to file a writ of habeas corpus because of her profile as an Americanized, \\"assimilated\\" Nisei: a practicing Christian who had never been to Japan, spoke only English and no Japanese, and had a brother in the U.S. Army.Fred T. Korematsu Institute, \\"Ex parte Mitsuye Endo \\" (accessed 5 June 2014). On July 13, 1942, Purcell filed the habeas corpus petition for Endo's release from the Tule Lake concentration camp where she and her family were being held. Judge Michael J. Roche heard Endo's case in July 1942 but did not issue a ruling until July 1943, when he denied her petition without explanation. An appeal was perfected to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in August 1943, and in April 1944 Judge William Denman sent the case to the Supreme Court rather than issuing a ruling himself. By this time Endo had been transferred to Topaz, Utah‚ÄîTule Lake having been converted to a segregated detention center for \\"disloyal\\" Japanese American inmates. The War Relocation Authority had offered to release her from camp (provided she agreed not to return to the West Coast) in an effort to halt the case, but Endo refused and so remained in confinement. Endo, Korematsu, and the end of internment The unanimous opinion ruling in Endo's favor was written by Justice William O. Douglas, with Justices Frank Murphy and Owen Roberts concurring. It stopped short of addressing the question of the government's right to exclude citizens based on military necessity, instead focusing on the actions of the WRA: \\"In reaching that conclusion [that Endo should be freed] we do not come to the underlying constitutional issues which have been argued. ... [W]e conclude that, whatever power the War Relocation Authority may have to detain other classes of citizens, it has no authority to subject citizens who are concededly loyal to its leave procedure.\\" Because of this avoidance, it is very difficult to reconcile Endo with Korematsu, which was decided the same day. As Justice Roberts pointed out in his Korematsu dissent, distinguishing the cases required a reliance on the legal fiction that Korematsu only dealt with the exclusion of Japanese Americans, not their detention‚Äîthat Fred Korematsu could have gone anywhere else in the United States, when in reality he would have been subject to the detainment found illegal in Endo.Paul Finkelman, \\"The Japanese Internment Cases.\\" Historic U.S. Court Cases: An Encyclopedia, Vol. 2, ed. John W. Johnson (Taylor & Francis, 2001) pp722-31. In short, while Endo determined that a citizen could not be imprisoned if the government was unable to prove she was disloyal, Korematsu allowed the government a loophole to criminally punish that citizen for refusing to be illegally imprisoned.Shiho Imai. \\"Korematsu v. United States\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 5 June 2014). The Roosevelt administration, having been alerted to the Court's decision, issued Public Proclamation No. 21 the day before the Endo and Korematsu rulings were made public, on December 17, 1944, rescinding the exclusion orders and declaring that Japanese Americans could begin returning to the West Coast in January 1945.

Military career Farrell graduated from Argentine military school in 1907 as an infantry sub-lieutenant. He served in an Italian alpine regiment in Fascist Italy between 1924 and 1926. He then returned to Argentina. After the 1943 coup, Farrell was promoted to Brigadier General and became vice-president during the military government of General Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez, who had deposed President Arturo Rawson. He was simultaneously Minister of War. Farrell appointed Juan Per√≥n as his secretary. President Ram√≠rez named Farrell as president on February 25, 1944. Farrell appointed Per√≥n as vice-president. After popular demonstrations in favour of Per√≥n in 1945 made Per√≥n the most influential and important man in the government, Farrell announced presidential elections for 1946, and Per√≥n was elected. On June 4, 1946, Farrell was succeeded as president by Per√≥n. Farrell had been his commander while Per√≥n was a colonel.

He also worked for David Frost, Ronnie Corbett and Ken Dodd. Life and career Braben's father was a butcher at St. John's Market, Liverpool, and he was born in Monkswell Street, Dingle. He was evacuated to Anglesey as a child during World War II, and was a fan of radio comedy, particularly Arthur Askey. He left school in 1945 and worked in the British American Tobacco factory before national service in the Royal Air Force, during which he was posted to the kitchen at RAF Kenley. He then worked as a market trader with his own greengrocery stall, writing jokes in his spare time. Although shy, he sent jokes to various comedians that were appearing in Liverpool. His first was sold to Charlie Chester for 2s 6d (12¬Ωp), but his first major success was with Ken Dodd, with whom he worked for 12 years. Braben's biggest success came when the BBC lured Morecambe and Wise from ITV.

The first Braben-penned Morecambe & Wise Show was broadcast in July 1969, and he wrote most of their BBC shows after that, including many of the Christmas specials. In 1980, he joined Thames Television to continue writing for the duo following their move back to ITV two years previously. Braben, along with Morecambe and Wise, won the Society of Film Television Artists 1973 award for Outstanding Contribution to Television. He also won the Best British Light Entertainment Script award from the Writer's Guild of Great Britain in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1973. Braben wrote and appeared in various radio comedy shows for the BBC, including The Worst Show on the Wireless (Radio 2; 1973‚Äì75) and The Show with Ten Legs (Radio 2; 1976‚Äì81). In 2001, Braben collaborated with Hamish McColl and Sean Foley to write The Play What I Wrote, a stage play and tribute to Morecambe and Wise, which opened at the Liverpool Playhouse Theatre before transferring to London's West End. The play won an Olivier Award for Best New Comedy, it later transferred to Broadway and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event. The director was Kenneth Branagh. Braben had a son, Graham, with his first wife. After her death, he married Deidree, an ex George Mitchell singer/dancer, with whom he had two daughters. He had six grandchildren. Braben's autobiography, The Book What I Wrote, was published in 2004. Braben's book, Eddie Braben's Morecambe and Wise Book, was published shortly after his death in 2013. In December 2017, Eric, Ernie and Me, a docudrama about Braben's work with Morecambe and Wise written by Neil Forsyth starring Stephen Tompkinson as Eddie Braben, was shown on BBC Four.

He was the founder and leader of Guardia Nacional, Argentina's Fascist militia.Current Biography 1943, p. 608 After graduating from the Argentine military college in 1904 as a second lieutenant, Ram√≠rez was promoted in 1910 as first lieutenant of the cavalry. In 1911, he was sent to Germany for training with the Fifth Hussars cavalry in Kaiser Wilhelm's Prussian Army. He returned home in 1913, with a German wife, prior to the outbreak of World War I.Current Biography 1943, pp. 608-611 Advancing in rank as a specialist in cavalry tactics, he assisted fellow General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu in a authoritarian coup that deposed Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen in 1930. Ram√≠rez was sent to Rome to observe Mussolini's army until his return in 1932. When Uriburu set free elections and died, General Ram√≠rez worked behind the scenes to plan a return of fascism to Argentina. Over the next several years, he organized the Milicia Nacionalista (later the Guardia), and authored a program for a state ruled by the militia. In 1942, Ram√≠rez was appointed as War Minister by President Ram√≥n Castillo, and began to reorganize the Argentine Army. At the same time, the Guardia Nacional joined with another party to form \\"Recuperacion Nacional,\\" a fascist political party. Castillo fired Ram√≠rez following a cabinet meeting on May 18, 1943. Two weeks later, on June 4, 1943, Ram√≠rez assisted Arturo Rawson in overthrowing Castillo's government, and was again made Minister of War. Three days later, on June 7 Ram√≠rez forced Rawson's resignation and maintained Argentina's neutrality during World War II. Argentina was torn by then between Britain, who wanted the country to stay neutral, and the U.S., who wanted it to join the Allies. Ram√≠rez stayed neutral and, consequently, the United States refused requests for Lend-Lease aid. Argentina finally declared war on Germany and Japan during the government of Edelmiro Farrell.

Published and released in 2003, it is the eighteenth installment of the series, which is set in the Star Wars universe. Summary The novel's subplot focuses on the Galactic Alliance's battle with the Yuuzhan Vong in the Bilbringi system. When the HoloNet is suddenly scrambled, General Wedge Antilles's forces are forced to fight tooth-and-nail against the Vong while Jaina Solo is forced to deal with a group of cowardly criminals aboard a space station that would have meant quite a deal against the galactic invaders. As a result of the Battle of Bilbringi, several Galactic Alliance officers are captured or killed, and the remnants of Antilles's forces retreat back to their home defenses. The main plot of the novel deals with the decisions made by Nom Anor and Nen Yim. With his heresy among the Shamed Ones starting to wane, Nom Anor reveals that a living world will come to save them and defeat Supreme Overlord Shimrra. Meanwhile, Master Shaper Nen Yim studies a spacecraft taken by an executed Yuuzhan Vong commander from the living world of Zonama Sekot. Nen Yim soon finds evidence that the biology between the Sekotan ship is similar to the DNA of the Yuuzhan Vong and their creations. This is part of the evidence among Nom Anor and the Shamed Ones that the living world that Ngaaluh mentioned in the previous novel is a destined harbinger of doom to Shimrra's order, or, to Shimrra and the elite, could spell the extermination of the Yuuzhan Vong as a whole. As this happens, the presence of the Quorealists becomes more well known in Shimrra's order. As it is revealed, the Quorealists are the lingering supporters of Shimrra's predecessor on the polyp throne, Quoreal, who espoused against invading the galaxy, which was what prompted Shimrra and his own supporters to overthrow and kill Quoreal and his followers. Priest Harrar, a secret Quorealist, becomes intrigued with the new evidence that Nen Yim uncovered from the Sekotan ship. Nom Anor decides to act upon what Nen Yim discovered by calling to the Galactic Alliance to send Jedi over to help him and Nen Yim escape Yuuzhan'tar and find Zonama Sekot. Tahiri Veila and Corran Horn respond to the call, and along with successfully collecting the disguised Nom Anor and Nen Yim, they also pick up the turncoat Harrar via the Sekotan ship. They use its navigation to travel to Zonama Sekot, where the ship lands and dies. The five travelers begin to study the planet alongside each other in order to get to know the others' ways. As Nen Yim eventually discovers a shocking truth between Zonama Sekot and the Yuuzhan Vong, Nom Anor makes a decision to kill the living world by sabotaging its hyperdrive cores just as he calls for help from the Vong; he believes that by killing the world that Shimrra fears so much, he would be inducted back into the elite. Nom Anor then reveals his true identity to Nen Yim and mortally wounds her before going after the hyperdrive cores. As she fades away into death, Nen Yim is able to tell Tahiri what Nom Anor plans to do, and she, Corran, and Harrar go after him. However, Nom Anor is successful in sabotaging the hyperdrive cores and escapes as the planet appears to begin dying. After Harrar is knocked off a cliff from his brief encounter with Nom Anor, Tahiri and Corran are rescued by Luke Skywalker, his wife Mara, Jacen Solo, and Saba Sebatyne, and they are all taken to shelter before Zonama Sekot jumps into hyperspace. Soon, Sekot, taking on the form of Nen Yim, reveals to the Jedi that Nom Anor's attempt to kill the living world has failed, and now, it is returning to known space to fight the Yuuzhan Vong.

Sir John Chandos, Viscount of Saint-Sauveur in the Cotentin, Constable of Aquitaine, Seneschal of Poitou, (c. 1320 ‚Äì 31 December 1369) was a medieval English knight who hailed from Radbourne Hall, Derbyshire. Chandos was a close friend of Edward the Black Prince and a founding member and 19th Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. Chandos was a gentleman by birth, but unlike most commanders of the day he held no inherited title of nobility. Described by the medieval historian Froissart as \\"wise and full of devices\\", as a military strategist Chandos is believed to have been the mastermind behind three of the most important English victories of the Hundred Years War: the Battle of Cr√©cy, the Battle of Poitiers and the Battle of Auray. His death in a minor skirmish was regretted by both sides. Origins Chandos was the son and heir of the lord of the manor of Radbourne, Derbyshire.Bernard Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland Part II (1863), pp. 1205-07 Inevitably, he trained in the arts of war and distinguished himself as a young knight. Military career According to the chronicles of Henry Knighton, on the eve of the Battle of Sluys, Edward III anchored his fleet at Blankenberge and sent ashore Chandos with Sir Reginald Cobham and Sir Stephen Lambkin to reconnoitre the French fleet. They found that the enemy vessels were ranged in three compact lines and included the captured English prize, the great cog Christopher; the ships were crammed together tightly and anchored at the entrance of the Zwin (also: Zwyn) channel.Knighton (1995) p. 29 Chandos was a leading figure at the Battle of Cr√©cy. As Chief of Staff to Edward, the Black Prince, he designed the strategy that won victory at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. In 1360, Chandos was created a knight banneret, which allowed him to hold a banner in battle. This came being made the Viscount of Saint-Sauveur by Edward III. This is contrary to the Life of the Black Prince, written by the Herald of John Chandos which suggested that Chandos was made a banneret immediately before the Battle of Najera in 1367. Nevertheless, on that occasion, Edward, the Black Prince of Wales, and Aquitaine at that time, merely unfurled the banner for Chandos as a mark of respect. On 29 September 1364, Chandos led the forces of Duke John de Montfort to victory at the Battle of Auray, winning the Breton War of Succession and enabling de Montfort to become John IV, Duke of Brittany. In reward for his service, Chandos was created the lieutenant of France, the vice-chamberlain of England and was given the viscounty of Saint-Sauveur in the Cotentin. During the Hundred Years' War, he became constable of Aquitaine. Later, however, after disagreeing with Edward over how the Guyennois should be taxed, he retired to his property in Normandy. Death In 1369, the French launched a successful counterattack, regaining much territory and forcing Edward to recall Chandos, who was appointed seneschal of Poitou and settled in Poitiers. Sir John attempted to deal with the French attempts to regain a foothold in the province. The Breton John Kerlou√´t and Louis de Saint Julien Trimouille, lord of Lusignan, had occupied La Roche-Posay and Saint-Savin, a few miles from Poitiers. Chandos decided to retake the abbey of Saint-Savin, with a surprise attack under cover of night. The planned attack failed when, thinking they had been detected by the enemy, Chandos' force retreated towards the bridge across the Vienne at Lussac-les-Ch√¢teaux, along the route to Poitiers through Chauvigny. The French, unaware of their presence, had decided to follow the same route to harass any English troops. The adversaries met at the bridge of Lussac. In the battle, Chandos' long coat made him slip on the frost. James de Saint-Martin, a squire in the house of Sir Bagnac (or Guillaume Boitel, according to Paul Hay du Chastelet) struck Chandos with his lance, piercing his face below the eye. Chandos' uncle Edward Twyford, standing over his wounded nephew, repulsed the attackers. One of his squires pierced both legs of James Saint-Martin with his sword; Saint-Martin died three days later at Poitiers. John Chandos was carried on a large shield to Morthemer, the nearest English fortress. He died in the night, either on 31 December or the early hours of 1 January 1370, after a day and night of agony, at the age of around 55. Legacy When the news of Sir John's death reached the court of Edward III in England, and that of the Black Prince at Guyenne, they were greatly upset. Chandos was not only a great warrior but also an able administrator and a wise politician. A cenotaph of John Chandos was erected shortly after his death by the English authorities to commemorate the spot where he fell. The cenotaph is still maintained and visible in a garden along the street Jean Chandos at a place called \\"Les Aubeniaux\\" (commune of Mazerolles (Vienne department). At the end of the 19th century, the local society of history moved it some yards away from the border of the Vienne because of the river's recurrent flooding. His passing was mourned on both sides. In his book A Brief History of The Hundred Years' War, Desmond Seward states that Charles V of France (\\"Charles the Wise\\") is reported to have said that \\"had Chandos lived, he would have found a way of making a lasting peace\\". Froissart is more circumspect, but says that \\"I have heard him at the time regretted by renowned knights in France; for they said it was a great pity he was slain, and that, if he could have been taken prisoner, he was so wise and full of devices, he would have found some means of establishing a peace between France and England\\". He also stated of Chandos that \\"never since a hundred years did there exist among the English one more courteous, nor fuller of every virtue and good quality than him.\\" Sir John Chandos was the founder of the Canto family in Portugal, which is believed to have later spread through Madeira and the Azores (:pt:Canto (apelido)).Einloft Neto 2011 Chandos Herald John Chandos' herald, known as Chandos Herald, wrote a significant poem entitled, The Life of the Black Prince.

Ortiz was born in Buenos Aires. As a student at the University of Buenos Aires, he participated in an unsuccessful revolution in 1905. In 1909 he graduated from the university and became a lawyer. He became active in the Radical Civic Union and was elected to the Argentine National Congress in 1920. He served as minister of public works from 1925 to 1928. He supported the revolution of 1930 and served as treasury minister from 1935 to 1937. In the presidential elections of 1937, he was the official government candidate and won, though the opposition accused him of participating in fraud, as irregularities were widespread. Ortiz never denied those charges but once he took office he tried to make Argentine politics more open and truly democratic. Soon after becoming president, Ortiz became seriously ill with diabetes and on July 3, 1940, he delegated his powers to vice-president Ram√≥n Castillo. He was pro-Ally but because of opposition in the army, he didn't break relations with the Axis. He resigned a few weeks before his death.

Its Grand Canyon represents the top grade in difficulty for a kayak descent. Considered one of the last truly wild major rivers in British Columbia, it drains a rugged, largely pristine, area east of the Coast Mountains, cutting a fast-flowing course through the mountains in deep glacier-lined gorges to empty into Eastern Passage, just north of the city of Wrangell, Alaska, which is situated at the north end of Wrangell Island in the Alexander Archipelago. Name origin The name in Coast Tsimshian dialect is and is a name for the Tahltan people who live up in the river's interior. They, Tsimshian-Nisga, named the river after the people who lived on it. The BC Names branch, however, say its Tlingit meaning is \\"great river\\" or \\"the definitive, or great river\\" as reported by Captain Rowan of the Boston trader Eliza in 1799. Its Russian name, first reported in Russian was ryeka Stahkin (—Ä–µ–∫–∞ –°—Ç–∞–∫–∏–Ω), in 1848, changed to its current form in 1869 after the Alaska Purchase in 1869. In the wording of that a letter to Secretary Seward, \\"Purchase of the Russian Possessions in North America by the U.S.A.\\", a letter from a Mr. Collins, dated 4 April 1867, New York, was St. Francis River. It has also been known as Pelly's River, and variously spelled Shikene, Stachine, Stachin, Stah-Keena, Stahkin, Stakeen, Stickeen, Stickienes, Stikeen, Stikin, Sucheen.BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Stikine River\\" Description Braided channels of the Stikine River near Little Dry Island The Stikine watershed encompasses approximately . The glacier-laden lower Stikine was compared by naturalist John Muir to Yosemite. The Stikine River arises in the Spatsizi Plateau, the southeasternmost subplateau of the Stikine Plateau, a large and partly mountainous plateau lying between the Stikine Ranges of the Cassiar Mountains (E) and the Boundary Ranges (W) in northern British Columbia. From there the river flows in a large northward arc turning to the west and southwest, past the gold rush and Tahltan community of Telegraph Creek. Above Telegraph Creek is the spectacular and Grand Canyon of the Stikine, the upper end of which is in the area of 130¬∞ west longitude. Below Telegraph Creek, which was at the head of river navigation during the Stikine and Cassiar Gold Rushes, the river cuts through the Tahltan Highland and in this region are the confluences of the Tuya and Tahltan Rivers. Much farther down, nearer the U.S. border, is the confluence of the Iskut and several other notably large (though short) rivers such as the Porcupine and Chutine. After passing Great Glacier and Choquette Hot Springs Provincial Parks and the old border-station at Stikine, British Columbia, it passes through a steeply cut gorge in the Boundary Ranges along the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border, and above that Grand Canyon of the Stikine. It briefly enters southeast Alaska for its lower to form a delta opposite Mitkof Island, approximately north of Wrangell. The Stikine's north arm empties into Frederick Sound while its main arm and southern distributaries empty into Sumner Strait and Stikine Strait. Other oceanic bodies of water that are influenced by the Stikine's estuary include the fjord-channel Eastern Passage separating Wrangell Island from the mainland and the shallow tidal Dry Strait separating Mitkof Island from the mainland. An international river The outlet of the river is now in Alaska, but at the time of the boundary survey in 1901‚Äì03 it had been at the boundary; the lower part of the river has since filled in from aggradation. According to the terms of the treaty, as per prior usage by mining and commercial traffic in the Stikine, Canadian marine traffic technically has the right of navigation of this river from the sea, independent of U.S. border controls, but this is no longer in practical effect through disuse and because of the relocation of the river's mouth. Tributaries The Stikine's main tributaries are, in descending order from its source: *Duti River *Chukachida River *Spatsizi River *Pitman River *McBride River *Klappan River **Little Klappan River *Tanzilla River *Klastline River *Tuya River **Little Tuya River *Tahltan River **Little Tahltan River *Chutine River *Porcupine River *Choquette River *Scud River *Iskut River **Little Iskut River *Tasakili River History Visitors on the Great Glacier near the Stikine River in 1914 The river is navigable for approximately upstream from its mouth. It was used by the coastal Tlingit as a transportation route to the interior region. The first European to explore the river was Samuel Black, who visited the headwaters during his Finlay River expedition in 1824. It was more extensively explored in 1838 by Robert Campbell, of the Hudson's Bay Company, completing the last link in the company's transcontinental canoe route. In 1879 the lower third was travelled by John Muir who likened it to \\"a Yosemite that was a hundred miles long\\". Muir recorded over 300 glaciers along the river's course. The Grand Canyon of the Stikine has been successfully navigated by less than 50 expert whitewater kayakers. It is considered one of the world's most difficult whitewater rivers in that particular section. From 1897 to 1898 it was one of the laborious routes to the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon Territory. Several railway schemes were floated to provide an \\"All Canadian\\" route to the Dawson goldfields‚ÄîA Teslin Railway, Omineca Railway, and the Canadian Yukon Railway promoted by the CPR. Railway contractors were hired and ready to build the route, though the Federal Senate and American government prevented the project from proceeding. Several river steamers were built to haul materials to Glenora to aid the project. The first road bridge was built across the river in the 1970s as part of the Stewart-Cassiar Highway. In 1978, BC Hydro began to study the feasibility of building a two-dam project on the Stikine, but the plan quickly led to opposition by conservation groups and a long struggle over the fate of the river. The mouth of the river in Alaska provides a habitat for migratory birds and is protected as part of the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness Area. The Canadian Navy vessel (TSRV) is named for this river.

He was a military officer, diplomat, and politician, and was president during the Infamous Decade. Justo took part in the coup of 1930, becoming president two years later thanks to widespread electoral fraud. His presidency was part of the period known as the Infamous Decade, which lasted from 1930 until 1943. He established the country's central bank and introduced a nationwide income tax. Appointed War Minister by President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, his experience under a civilian administration and pragmatic outlook earned him the conservative Concordance's nomination for the 1931 campaign. He was elected president on November 8, 1931, supported by the political sectors that would form shortly after la Concordancia, an alliance created between the National Democratic Party (Partido Dem√≥crata Nacional), the Radical Civic Union (Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical) (UCR), and the Socialist Independent Party (Partido Socialista Independiente). There were accusations of electoral fraud, and the name patriotic fraud was used for a system of control established from 1931 to 1943. Conservative groups wanted to use this to prevent any radicals from coming to power. During this period there was persistent opposition from the supporters of Yrigoyen, an earlier president, and from the Radical Civic Union. The outstanding diplomatic work of his Foreign Minister, Carlos Saavedra Lamas, was one of the greatest accomplishments of his administration, stained by constant accusations of corruption and of delivering the national economy into the hands of foreign interests, the British in particular, with whom his vice-president Julio A. Roca, Jr. had signed the Roca-Runciman Treaty. His name was mentioned as a candidate a new period during the unsteady government of Ram√≥n Castillo, but his early death at 66 thwarted his plans. He worked on a preliminary study for the complete works of Bartolom√© Mitre, whom he admired profoundly. Biography Justo was born in Concepci√≥n del Uruguay, Entre R√≠os Province. His father, also named Agust√≠n, had been governor of Corrientes Province and was soon a national deputy. He was active in politics, and soon after his son was born he moved with his family to Buenos Aires. His mother Otilia Rol√≥n, came from a traditional Corrientes family. When he was 11 Justo went to the Colegio Militar de la Naci√≥n (National Military College). As a cadet, and joined with various other students and participated in the Revoluci√≥n del Parque, taking the weapons off the guards to add to the column of the revolutionaries. Arrested and later given amnesty, he graduated with the rank of ensign. Without abandoning his military career, he studied engineering at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1895 he was promoted to second lieutenant. In 1897 he became first lieutenant. In 1902 he became a captain. Having attained a civil engineering degree at the University of Buenos Aires, a governmental decree validated his title as a military engineer in 1904. He was appointed as teacher at the Escuela de Aplicaci√≥n para Oficiales. With his promotion to the rank of major two years later he was proposed for the school of mathematics at the Military Academy and for the studies of telemetry and semaphores at the Escuela Nacional de Tiro (National Gunnery School), which would be granted in 1907. The following year, he received the nomination as executive officer in the Batall√≥n de Ferrocarrileros, at the same time in which they were promoting him to be subdirector at the gunnery school. With the rank of Lieutenant Colonel he completed diplomatic actions, becoming military attach√© to the Argentina's envoy at the centennial festivities in Chile in 1910. His return to Argentina was to C√≥rdoba, as commander of the Fourth Artillery Brigade. Beginning of political career In 1915, during the term of office of Victorino de la Plaza, he was appointed director of the Military College, a post where he would remain for the following seven years. The great influence of this position helped him to weave contacts in political circles, just as in the military. Pursuant to the radical anti-personalist political branch (those that opposed the party leadership of Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen), he established good relations with Marcelo T. de Alvear. During his tenure he enlarged the curriculum of the college and promoted the formation of the faculty. During Alvear's administration in 1922 he left the Military College to become the Minister of War. Promoted to the rank of brigadier general on August 25, 1923, Justo requested an increase of the defense budget to get equipment and improve the Army infrastructure. He also fomented the reorganization of the armed forces structure. At the end of 1924 he was sent as plenipotentiary to Peru, where they were celebrating the centennial of the Battle of Ayacucho. During the next few years he temporarily was the Minister of Agriculture and Public Works, besides holding the post at as Minister of War, which he would not abandon until the end of the term of office of Alvear. In 1927 he had received the promotion to General de Divisi√≥n (Major General). With his constant anti- personalist temperament, Justo supported the candidates Leopoldo Melo and Vicente Gallo, of the Alvear Line of the UCR. Before the triumph of the formula of Yrigoyen and Beir√≥, who began in 1928 their second term of office with massive support of the voters and the majority in the House of Representatives. Justo received invitations of the ever more organized right to join the shock program against the radical caudillo. Although close to the concepts of the publications La Nueva Rep√∫blica (The New Republic) ‚Äî managed by Ernesto Palacio and the brothers Rodolfo and Julio Irazusta ‚Äî and La Fronda, under the direction of Francisco Uriburu, they stayed close to the need of \\"order, hierarchy and authority\\". He did not adhere closely to them, the program of suppression of a republican government and their substitution with a corporativesystem, similar to the fascists in Italy and Spain, went against his liberal vocation. 1930 Coup 1931 ballot, Justo-Roca Around Justo another faction assembled, not any less intent on taking arms against the constitutional government of Yrigoyen. Actively promoted by general Jos√© Luis Meglione, a Justo classmate, and by colonel Luis J. Garc√≠a, who soon would be one of the heads of the Grupo de Oficiales Unidos, he wrote for the newspapers La Naci√≥n and Cr√≠tica. Declarations made by Justo in July 1930 about the inconvenience of military intervention, which would put the constitutional rule of law in danger, testify to the opposition between the factions. By contrast with the more radicalized Argentine Navy, a significant part of the Army supported the ideas proposed by Justo, with the notable exception of the nationalist core that soon would converge at the Grupo de Oficiales Unidos. Before the promise of Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu, the head of an extremist group, to maintain institutional order, Justo gave his agreement to the coup, which he expressed on the early morning of September 6, thus starting a military government in Argentina for the first time since the signing of the Constitution. He did not join the government's direction nor, in the first instance, the governing group, which was led by Uriburu with a cabinet that was composed largely of local lobbyists of the multinational oil companies. Justo expressly sought to distance himself from Uriburu, who counted on a large group of supporters among the military officials but could not get the same support from the political parties, which quickly divided themselves after Yrigoyen's death, the focus of the antipathy against him. He rejected the vice-presidency that Uriburu offered him, and he only briefly accepted the command of the army, resigning soon after. In Buenos Aires Province, Uriburu did not manage to implement the corporate model with which he wished to replace the republican system, and this failure cost him the political career of his Interior Minister, Mat√≠as S√°nchez Sorondo. Justo again rejected the offers of Uriburu to join the government and form a coalition. With the support of an alliance of the conservative National Democratic Party, the Independent Socialist Party, and the most anti-personalist faction of the Radical Party (then to be the Coalition of Parties for Democracy), he ran for president on the elections of November 8, 1931. With Yrigoyen's faction banned from the elections and its supporters using the strategy of \\"revolutionary abstention\\", Justo easily won against Lisandro de la Torre and Nicol√°s Repetto, although under suspicion of fraud. Julio Argentino Roca, Jr., from the conservative faction, joined him as Vice-President. Presidency Justo became president on February 20, 1932. In addition to political turmoil caused by the coup, he had to make progress on the problems relating to the Great Depression, which had put an end to commercial profits and the full employment enjoyed by the Yrigoyen and Alvear administrations. His first minister of the Treasury, Alberto Hueyo, took very restrictive measures against the economy. The independent socialist Antonio de Tomaso joined him in Agriculture. He reduced the public expense, and restricted the circulation of currency and applied harsh fiscal measures. An empr√©stito patri√≥tico, or patriotic loan, was made, attempting to strengthen the financial coffers. The first of these measures was imposed on gasoline. It was meant to finance the newly created Direcci√≥n Nacional de Vialidad, or the National Office of Public Highways, which undertook the betterment of the highway network. The difficulties for Hueyo's program would finally convince Justo to adopt this model (de √≠ndole dirigista) in his economic policy. In addition, he encouraged the project of the mayor of Buenos Aires, Mariano de Vedia y Mitre, who undertook an ambitious project of urban organization, opening the Diagonales Norte y Sur, paving Avenue General Paz, widening Avenue Corrientes, constructing the first stretch of Avenue 9 de Julio and building the Obelisk of Buenos Aires. The substitution of Hueyo by the socialist Frederico Pinedo would mark a change in the political scene in the government. The intervention of the government in the economy was more significant, creating the Junta Nacional de Granos, or the National Grain Committee, and of Meat, and soon after, with the advice of English economist Otto Niemeyer, the creation of the Banco Central de la Rep√∫blica Argentina, or the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic. Relationship with the UCR The radical opposition was very significant. On April 5, 1931, the political ideology of the supporters of Yrigoyen had won the election for governor in the province of Buenos Aires against the hopes of Uriburu and S√°nchez Sorondo; though the military government rings, cost the career of the Minister and forced Uriburu to give up his power. Before this, soldiers loyal to the constitutional government of Yrigoyen, with the support of armed civilians, organized insurrections to restore that earlier government. The first of these was directed by the Yrigoyenist general Severino Toranzo in February 1931. In June, in Curuz√∫ Cuati√° in the province of Corrientes, they assassinated Colonel Regino Lescano, who was preparing a Yrigoyenist mobilization. In December, before an attempted coup led by Lieutenant Colonel Atilio Catt√°neo, Justo decreed a state of siege, and again imprisoned the old Yrigoyen, and also arrested Alvear, Ricardo Rojas, Honorio Pueyrred√≥n, and other leaders of the party. In 1933, the attempted coups continued. Buenos Aires, Corrientes, Entre Rios, and Misiones would be the stage of radical uprisings, which would not end before more than a thousand people being detained. Seriously ill, Yrigoyen was returned to Buenos Aires and kept under house arrest. He died on June 3, and his burial in La Recoleta Cemetery was an occasion of a mass demonstration. In December, during a meeting of the national convention of the UCR, a joint uprising of the military and politicians broke loose in Santa Fe, Rosario, and Paso de los Libres. Jos√© Benjamin Abalos, who was Yrigoyen's ex-Minister, and Colonel Roberto Bosch were arrested during the uprising and the organizers and leaders of the party were imprisoned at Mart√≠n Garc√≠a. Alvear, Justo's former patron, was exiled, while others were detained in the penitentiary in Ushuaia. Roca-Runciman Treaty One of the most controversial events of Justo's presidency took place in 1933, when the measures of production protectionism that were adopted by the UK led Justo to send his vice-president at the head of a technology delegation, to deal with the adoption of a commercial agreement that might benefit Argentina. At the 1932 Ottawa Conference, the British had adopted measures that favored imports from its own colonies and dominions. The pressure from the Argentine landowners for whom the government restored trade with the main buyer of Argentine grain and meat had been very strong. Led by the president of the British Trade Council, Viscount Walter Runciman, they were intense and resulted in the signing on April 27 of the Roca-Runciman Treaty. The treaty created a scandal because the UK allotted Argentina a quota less than any of its other dominions. In exchange for many concessions to British companies, 390,000 tons of meat per year were allotted to Argentina. British refrigerated shippers arranged 85% of exportation. The tariffs of the railways operated by the UK were not regulated. They had not established customs fees over coal. They had given special dispensation to the British companies with investments in Argentina. They had reduced the prices of their exports. As many problems resulted from the declarations of the vice- president Roca, who affirmed after the signing of the treaty that \\"by its economic importance, Argentina resembled just a large British dominion.\\" Lisandro de la Torre, one of his principal and most vociferous opponents, mocking the words of Roca in an editorial, wrote that \\"in these conditions we wouldn't be able to say that Argentina had been converted into a British dominion because England does not take the liberty to impose similar humiliations upon its dominions.\\" In the National Democratic Party, one of those who had supported the nomination of Justo for President, had split because of this controversy. Finally, the Senate rescinded the treaty on July 28. Many workers strikes followed the deliberations, especially in Santa F√© Province, which ended with government intervention.

Portal Planeta Sedna. Consultado el 4 de mayo de 2010. Biography Marcelo de Alvear's official portrait, 1922. Alvear was the son of Torcuato de Alvear, first Mayor of Buenos Aires. As a young man he was a successful sports shooter, winning an individual bronze and a team gold in the free pistol event in the 1903 World Championship held in Buenos Aires. He would receive a team silver in the 1904 edition in Lyon, France. He was the founder of Argentina's National Olympic Committee. Politics As a politician he became the leader of the anti-personalistic faction of the centrist part of the Radical Civic Union (UCR) co-founded by Yrigoyen, opposed to some of president Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen's policies. In contrast to Yrigoyen's popular style, Alvear belonged to the self-appointed \\"aristocracy\\" of Buenos Aires and never tried to hide it. He married opera singer Regina Pacini. In 1917, he was appointed Ambassador to France. Presidency In 1922, Argentina's president Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen designated Alvear to be his successor.

Encouraged by favorable results during mid-term elections in 1936, the UCR ran a vigorous campaign ahead of the 1937 presidential election.

Formed in San Francisco in 1964, the band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). They were discovered by local disc jockeys who were looking to sign acts to their new label, Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewart‚Äîlater known as Sly Stone‚Äîproduced the group's early recording sessions. Initially, the band's musical style blended beat music and folk music and typically drew comparisons to the Beatles, while their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock. The Beau Brummels broke into the mainstream with their debut single, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\", for which they would later be credited for setting one of the aesthetic foundations for the San Francisco Sound, along with other bands such as the Charlatans; the song is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". The band's popularity continued with the subsequent album, 1965's Introducing The Beau Brummels, and the Top 10 single \\"Just a Little\\". The group's commercial success declined by the following year, at which time the financially struggling Autumn label was acquired by Warner Bros. Records. After recording an album of cover songs, Beau Brummels '66, the band released a pair of critically acclaimed albums: Triangle in 1967 and Bradley's Barn in 1968. The band underwent several personnel changes, beginning with Mulligan's departure in 1965. Guitarist Don Irving joined the band in late 1965 when Elliott began to suffer seizures resulting from a diabetic condition, leaving him unable to tour with the band. Shortly after the release of Beau Brummels '66, Irving left the group when he was inducted into the armed forces. Petersen left to join Harpers Bizarre, reducing the Beau Brummels to a trio for the recording of Triangle. Meagher was drafted for military service in 1968, leaving Valentino and Elliott as the only remaining band members. The duo worked with prominent Nashville session musicians to record Bradley's Barn before parting ways in 1969 to focus on solo material and participate in projects by other artists. Four of the original Beau Brummels reformed in 1974 with one new member and the band released a self-titled album the following year. History Formation (1964) Sal Valentino grew up in the North Beach section of San Francisco. In early 1964, following a string of appearances as a singer on local television, Valentino received an offer to play a regular gig at El Cid, a San Francisco club. Needing a band, he called childhood friend and songwriter/guitarist Ron Elliott, who recruited drummer John Petersen, rhythm guitarist/singer Declan Mulligan, and bassist Ron Meagher. Victor Savant, later to achieve fame in Europe as musical director for schlager singer Roberto Blanco, was in the band for a brief period as a pianist, but never recorded with the band. The gig led to a more lucrative deal at the Morocco Room, a club in nearby San Mateo, California. Meanwhile, San Francisco disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell were looking for new acts to bring to their fledgling Autumn Records label. Donahue and Mitchell wanted to capitalize on the Beatlemania craze that originated the previous year in the UK and was spreading across the U.S. by this time. Rich Romanello, owner of the Morocco Room and the Brummels' first manager, asked Donahue and Mitchell to see the band perform at the club. Romanello recalled, \\"There were maybe four people in the place, and they set up and started playing, and that old hair on my arm goes up. And when the hair on your arm goes up, you got something. It was a big change, to go from saxophones and black singers to a white guitar sound, but I hired 'em.\\" The Beau Brummels signed with Autumn, where house producer Sylvester Stewart‚Äîlater known as Sly Stone, of Sly & the Family Stone fame‚Äîproduced the group's early recording sessions. The Beau Brummels took their name from the Regency era English dandy Beau Brummell. The group liked having a British-sounding name, and the legend has been, since it so closely followed The Beatles in the alphabet, the group also knew their records would likely be placed immediately behind those of The Beatles in record-store bins. Valentino dismissed this notion in a 2008 interview with Goldmine magazine. \\"That's a total myth\\", he said. \\"We just needed a name, and that sounded good. We didn't even know how to spell it. Everybody now has a notion of what people were thinking back then, but we never thought of those kinds of things.\\" Al Hazan, who produced the band's demo recording, noted, \\"I never thought of the Brummels in terms of the Beatles‚Äîit was Ron Elliott's talent as a songwriter that caused me to want to produce them.\\" Introducing the Beau Brummels and The Beau Brummels, Volume 2 (1965) The band's debut single, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in January 1965. As the song climbed the charts, many listeners assumed The Beau Brummels were British, due to the band's name and musical style, which recalled such bands as The Beatles and The Zombies.Unterberger (2000) p. 174. The comparisons were bolstered by Donahue and Mitchell, who had the band dress in Beatlesque suits and spread rumors that the band was indeed British. \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" peaked at number 15 in February, but Donahue believed the single would have gone to number one if the band was on a label with stronger distribution. The song was the band's highest-charting single in Canada, where it reached number two on the Canadian Singles Chart. The band's follow-up single, \\"Just a Little\\", became the band's highest-charting single in the U.S., peaking at number eight in June. Both songs were included on the band's debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels, which was released in April and reached number 24 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The band appeared as themselves and performed in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, (which was later featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000). The band appeared as \\"The Beau Brummelstones\\" on The Flintstones television animated sitcom in the season six episode \\"Shinrock A Go-Go\\", which originally aired on December 3, 1965.This marked the first time a celebrity was on an episode of the Flintstones. When recording began for the band's second album, 1965's The Beau Brummels, Volume 2, Mulligan was no longer a member of the group.Unterberger (2000) p. 177. In 1966 Mulligan filed an unsuccessful lawsuit, claiming he was wrongfully dismissed from the group.he sued the band for $1.25 million in damages, \\"You Tell Me Why\\", the album's lead single, was the band's third and final U.S. top 40 hit, peaking at number 38 in August 1965. Another single, \\"Don't Talk to Strangers\\", reached number 52 in November. While Stone is credited as the album's producer, his involvement, according to Sal Valentino and Ron Elliott, had diminished to the point that the band does not recall any producer being in charge. By the end of the year, Elliott began to suffer seizures from his diabetic condition that left him unable to perform. Don Irving became Elliott's stand-in on guitar when the group performed live, and also recorded with them. Beau Brummels '66, Triangle and Bradley's Barn (1966‚Äì68) The Beau Brummels made a musical guest appearance performing \\"Just Wait and See\\" in Wild Wild Winter (actually filmed in 1965, before Village of the Giants and when Mulligan was still in the band) a beach party-inspired comedy film by Universal Pictures which was released January 5, 1966. The band continued recording new material despite Autumn verging on collapse.Unterberger (2000) pp. 177‚Äì8. Such songs as \\"I Grow Old\\", \\"Gentle Wandering Ways\\" and \\"Dream On\\", along with Valentino-composed tracks such as \\"Love Is Just a Game\\", \\"This Is Love\\", and \\"Hey, Love\\", would have most likely been included on the band's third album for Autumn.Unterberger (2000) p. 178. But before an album was completed and released, the entire Autumn roster, including the Beau Brummels, was transferred to Warner Bros. Records. Warner Bros., however, did not control the band's publishing, and consequently the company chose not to have the band release an album of original material. The unreleased songs were later included on the 2005 three-disc compilation album San Fran Sessions. Instead, Warner Bros. opted to have the band record an album of cover songs. Released in July 1966, Beau Brummels '66 was considered a commercial and critical disappointment.Unterberger (2000) pp. 178‚Äì9. The non-album single \\"One Too Many Mornings\\", a Bob Dylan cover, was the band's sixth and final Hot 100 chart entry, peaking at number 95 in June. Petersen left the band after the album's release to join Harpers Bizarre, while Irving departed when he received an induction notice into the armed forces. The three remaining members quit touring to focus on studio work. The band resumed writing original material for their fourth album, Triangle, produced by Lenny Waronker. Session musicians, such as Van Dyke Parks, who played harpsichord on \\"Magic Hollow\\", contributed to the album. Released in July 1967, Triangle only reached number 197 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, but it was praised by critics, including Australian journalist and author Lillian Roxon in her 1969 Rock Encyclopedia. In 1968, Meagher was drafted for military service, leaving the Beau Brummels as a duo consisting of Valentino and Elliott. The duo went to Tennessee to record their fifth album, and worked with prominent Nashville session musicians such as Kenny Buttrey, a drummer on Bob Dylan's albums from 1966 to 1969, and guitarist Jerry Reed.Unterberger (2000) p. 181. The Beau Brummels were so pleased with the results at the studio that they named the album Bradley's Barn, after the studio in which it was recorded. Shortly following the album's release in October 1968, the Beau Brummels split up. Solo works, other projects and reformation (1969‚Äì2013) The Beau Brummels in 1974. From left: John Petersen, Ron Elliott, Sal Valentino, Ron Meagher, Declan Mulligan Following a stint in 1969 recording solo singles for Warner Bros. Records, Valentino assembled a new band, Stoneground, which was associated with the hippie commune the Hog Farm in the early 1970s. The band broke up in 1973 after releasing three albums. Elliott, who in 1968 played guitar on Van Dyke Parks' debut album, Song Cycle, and arranged The Everly Brothers' album, Roots, released a solo album, The Candlestickmaker, in 1970. During the early 1970s, Elliott produced albums by Levitt & McClure and Pan, and played on albums by Van Morrison, Randy Newman and Little Feat. Meanwhile, Mulligan and Meagher were members of the Black Velvet Band. In 1969, Petersen married Roberta Templeman, sister of Harpers Bizarre's Ted Templeman. Petersen remained with Harper's Bizarre until the band broke up in the early 1970s. In February 1974, Billboard magazine reported that the Beau Brummels had reformed in San Francisco. The band resumed touring, and a 1974 performance recorded in Fair Oaks Village near Sacramento, California was released in 2000 as the Live! album. In April 1975, the band released a self-titled studio album, which reached number 180 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. One of the band's previous singles, 1965's \\"You Tell Me Why\\", was re-recorded for the album. Although the band split up again soon after the album's release, the Beau Brummels continued to work in various incarnations from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s, including shows with The Smithereens, and often appeared in tandem with The Dinosaurs, the psychedelic-era \\"supergroup\\". The band also performed at shows such as the Baypop 2000 Festival and the 2002 Summer of Love Festival, both in San Francisco. In 2006, Valentino released Dreamin' Man, the first solo album of his 50-year career. Another album, Come Out Tonight, followed later that year, and his third solo album, Every Now and Then, was released in 2008. John Petersen died of a heart attack on November 11, 2007. The remaining original band members reunited to record a studio album, Continuum, released in March 2013 on Bay Sound Records. The album features drum tracks that were recorded in 1965 by Petersen and contains 15 songs written by Elliott, along with re-recordings of \\"Just a Little\\", \\"Don't Talk to Strangers\\", and \\"Laugh, Laugh\\". Musical style Combining beat music and folk rock, the Beau Brummels were most often compared, especially early in their career, to British bands such as the Beatles and the Zombies. The Beau Brummels were fans of these acts as well as The Rolling Stones and The Searchers, and originally patterned their overall style after the British Invasion sound. The melancholy, minor keys of debut single \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" led many listeners to mistakenly believe that the band were indeed British. As the band evolved, they incorporated different music genres into their works, ranging from hard rock to country and western to rhythm and blues. The Triangle album exhibited the band's growing interest in country music along with elements of psychedelic pop, including the use of strings, brass, woodwinds, harpsichord, and various types of unique percussion. Ron Elliott said the album was \\"sort of a mood swing into the world that was around us at the time. It was sort of dissolving into this drug culture. So the music became very ethereal, mystic, and mysterious.\\"Unterberger (2000) p. 180. The band's country rock fusion was most evident on their 1968 album Bradley's Barn, which Elliott said was similar stylistically to Triangle, but with more country accents.Unterberger (2000) pp. 180‚Äì1. The band members have been hesitant to categorize their music, preferring to call it a combination of styles, according to Elliott. \\"We don't play anything really different‚Äîwe play melodically and rhythmically\\", he said in a 1965 interview. \\"I think that's why the [Rolling] Stones have made it. They don't do anything really fantastic but they have good taste, and good taste is more important than speed.\\" Sal Valentino praised Elliott's vocal style, saying that \\"Ron had a great low register. He knew how to write in the best keys for me.\\" Valentino added, \\"From the time I started singing in bands, I didn't really sing too many other people's songs other than Ron's. Being able to sing just one person's writing, who was a pretty able writer with ability to adjust to what he's working with, had a lot to do with the way I sang.\\" Valentino also credited Sly Stone's input for the band's early success. \\"He had a lot to do with making our music relatable and anticipating how our records would sound on the radio, particularly on the bottom, rhythm end. Sly was very motivated to make a lot of money, and he was awfully talented.\\" Legacy Clockwise from top right: John Petersen, Sal Valentino, Ron Meagher, Ron Elliott, and Declan Mulligan perform as the Beau Brummelstones in a 1965 episode of The Flintstones The Beau Brummels are considered the first band from a burgeoning San Francisco music scene to achieve widespread success in response to the British Invasion, standing out among such bands as The Charlatans, Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, We Five, Moby Grape, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Country Joe and the Fish. At the height of the band's popularity, the Beau Brummels were regarded as teen idols, appearing on several television music variety shows including American Bandstand, Shindig! and Hullabaloo, as well as the teen films Village of the Giants and Wild Wild Winter. The band also appeared as the Beau Brummelstones in a 1965 episode of the animated television sitcom The Flintstones. The band pioneered blending beat music with folk rock, as \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" was recorded before The Byrds recorded \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". The group's Triangle (1967) and Bradley's Barn (1968) albums are considered early examples in the country rock music genre.Unterberger (2000) p. 183. \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" was included on the 1998 reissue of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965‚Äì1968, a compilation double album of American garage rock singles that helped influence the development of 1970s punk rock. The song was also featured during a scene in the 1989 comedy-drama film Uncle Buck, starring John Candy. In 1994, \\"Laugh, Laugh\\" was named to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's exhibit showcasing The 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\\". In the June 1997 issue of Mojo magazine, \\"Magic Hollow\\" was selected one of the \\"100 Greatest Psychedelic Classics\\". Music journalist and author Tom Moon named Triangle to his 2008 book of the 1,001 Recordings to Hear Before You Die.

Lawrence Tech was founded in 1932 in Highland Park, Michigan, as the Lawrence Institute of Technology (LIT) by Russell E. Lawrence. The university moved to Southfield in 1955 and has since expanded to . The campus also includes the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Affleck House in Bloomfield Hills and the Detroit Center for Design + Technology in Midtown Detroit. The school offers undergraduate, masters, and doctoral programs in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics fields. The university's four colleges are Architecture and Design, Arts and Sciences, Business and Information Technology, and Engineering. LTU's athletic teams are known as the Blue Devils. They compete in the NAIA and joined the Wolverine Hoosier Athletic Conference in 2012.  Academics  Lawrence Tech offers over 100 programs in four colleges, with a total enrollment of nearly 4,500 students, and employs over 400 full- and part-time faculty. In November 2016, LTU and St. John Providence Hospitals announced they had received state approval to establish a nursing education program. The program, which opened in August 2017, has classroom instruction at LTU's Southfield campus, with clinical and laboratory instruction at six St. John Providence hospital locations around metro Detroit. The new program will fall under Lawrence Tech's College of Arts and Sciences as a major in the LTU Department of Natural Sciences, granting a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. LTU will admit up to 32 students a year in the program. Lawrence Tech has hired Therese Jamison, DNP, ACNP-BC, as professor of nursing and director of the program. Jamison earned her Doctorate of Nursing Practice from Vanderbilt University. Earlier, she earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a master's degree in Nursing from Wayne State University, as well as a post- master's certificate as an acute care nurse practitioner from the University of Michigan. A veteran nursing specialist, Jamison continues to work one day a week as a nurse practitioner in cardiovascular services at St. John Macomb- Oakland Hospital, Warren Campus.  Athletics  The Don Ridler Field House Lawrence Tech's mascot BlueLawrence Tech teams are known as the Blue Devils. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Wolverine‚ÄìHoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) while the university's second men's ice hockey team is a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) at the Division III level as a member of the Michigan Collegiate Hockey Conference (MCHC). Men's sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, ice hockey, lacrosse and soccer; while women's sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, lacrosse, soccer and volleyball. Lawrence Tech fielded athletic teams throughout its history from 1930 to 1962. The 1950‚Äì51 men's basketball team played the 1951 National Invitation Tournament, held at Madison Square Garden in New York. Lawrence Tech was defeated by Dayton, 71-77 in the opening round of the tournament. Blaine Denning, an alumnus from the 1951 team, went on to play professional basketball with the Baltimore Bullets of the NBA. Lawrence Tech re-instated athletic programs in 2011 and joined the NAIA. Men's soccer and bowling, along with women's volleyball, joined the already established men's ice hockey team for the university's athletic offerings during the 2011‚Äì12 academic year. During its fifth season in the NAIA, the university fielded teams in men's baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, hockey, volleyball, lacrosse, soccer and tennis, and women's basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball. Thanks to a $1 million gift from an anonymous donor, during the summer of 2016 Lawrence Tech constructed an AstroTurf surface athletic field at the Point, the part of campus at the intersection of Northwestern Highway and 10 Mile Road. LTU's men's and women's soccer and lacrosse teams began playing on this field in August 2016. The project also includes a 40-car parking lot. In the summer of 2018, lighting for night games, a new scoreboard with a video replay display, temporary seating for 2,000 fans and a pressbox were constructed in preparation for the inaugural 2018 season of LTU's football team. The first football game, held Sept. 1, 2018, drew an overflow crowd of more than 3,800 fans. Future plans for the site include permanent stadium seating for 4,000 fans, a two-story team building with locker rooms, a weight room, and offices for trainers and coaches, and a concession and restroom building. In January 2017, Lawrence Tech announced that it would resume intercollegiate football competition, after a hiatus of more than 70 years dating back to just after World War II. The university has admitted two recruiting classes of about 90 student-athletes for a team that competed as an independent squad in the fall of 2018, and which will begin playing a full varsity schedule in the Mid-States Football Association of the NAIA in the fall of 2019. LTU hired Jeff Duvendeck, former head coach at Culver-Stockton (Mo.) College and a former assistant at Michigan State University, Northern Michigan University, Michigan Technological University, Grand Valley State University, and Tiffin (Ohio) University, as its head coach. The Blue Devils finished 5-3 in their abbreviated first season, and attracted nearly 4,000 fans to their first game on Sept. 1, 2018.  Student life   Student organizations  On campus extracurricular activities include leadership opportunities and more than 60 student clubs and organizations. Student Government represents all organizations on campus. The university generally allows new student clubs in any interest area if they are supported by a student petition with at least 30 signatures.  Fraternities and sororities  The University is also home to chapters of fraternities, including Alpha Sigma Phi, Theta Tau, Sigma Pi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Phi Kappa Upsilon, and Phi Beta Sigma. The sororities represented on campus include Chi Omega Rho, Delta Tau Sigma, Delta Phi Epsilon, and Kappa Beta Gamma. Notable alumni * Steven A.

It is traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, whipped egg whites, and egg yolks (which gives it a frothy texture, and its name). In some contexts, distilled spirits such as brandy, rum, whisky or bourbon are added to the drink. Throughout Canada and the United States, eggnog is traditionally consumed over the Christmas season, from late November until the end of the holiday season. A variety called Ponche Crema has been made and consumed in Venezuela and Trinidad since the 1900s, also as part of the Christmas season. During that time, commercially prepared eggnog is sold in grocery stores in these countries. Eggnog is also homemade using milk, eggs, sugar, and flavorings, and served with cinnamon or nutmeg. While eggnog is often served chilled, in some cases it is warmed, particularly on cold days (similar to the way mulled wine is served warm). Eggnog or eggnog flavoring may also be used in other drinks, such as coffee (e.g. an \\"eggnog latte\\" espresso drink) and tea, or to dessert foods such as egg-custard puddings. Terminology A woman serves commercially prepared eggnog to US military personnel at a Christmas party. The Modern Bartender's Guide from 1878 lists many variant names for the drink. It distinguishes \\"plain egg nog\\", \\"egg milk punch\\", and \\"milk punch\\" from one another. It also includes variants such as \\"Baltimore egg nog\\", \\"General Jackson egg nog\\", \\"Imperial egg nog\\", two types of \\"sherry cobbler egg nog\\", as well as \\"sherry cobbler with egg\\", \\"mulled claret with egg\\", \\"egg sour\\", and \\"Saratoga egg lemonade\\" (also called \\"sea breeze\\"). History A carton and a glass of eggnog from Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, showing its French fa√ßade and the French term lait de poule (literally, \\"hen's milk\\") Etymology and origins The origins, etymology, and the ingredients used to make original eggnog drinks are debated. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, nog was \\"a kind of strong beer brewed in East Anglia\\". The first known use of the word \\"nog\\" was in 1693. Alternatively, nog may stem from noggin, a Middle English term for a small, carved wooden mug used to serve alcohol. However, the British drink was also called an Egg Flip, from the practice of \\"flipping\\" (rapidly pouring) the mixture between two pitchers to mix it. One dictionary lists the word \\"eggnog\\" as being an Americanism invented in 1765‚Äì75. Babson College professor Frederick Douglass Opie \\"wrote that the term is a combination of two colonial slang words‚Äîrum was referred to as grog and bartenders served it in small wooden mugs called noggins. The drink first became known as egg-n-grog and later as eggnog.\\" Ben Zimmer, executive editor for Vocabulary.com, disputes the \\"egg-n-grog\\" theory as lacking proof; Zimmer states that the term \\"nog\\" may be related to the \\"Scottish term nugg or nugged ale, meaning \\"ale warmed with a hot poker.\\" The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the term \\"egg nog\\" is an American term introduced in 1775, consisting of the words \\"egg\\" and \\"nog\\", with \\"nog\\" meaning \\"strong ale\\". The first example of the term \\"eggnog\\" was in 1775, when Maryland clergyman and philologist Jonathan Boucher wrote a poem about the drink which was not published until 30 years after his death: \\"Fog-drams i' th' morn, or (better still) egg-nogg, / At night hot-suppings, and at mid-day, grogg, / My palate can regale\\". The first printed use of the term appeared in the New-Jersey Journal of March 26, 1788, which referred to a young man drinking a glass of eggnog. An 1869 dictionary entry for \\"egg nog\\" defines it as a mixture of wine, spirits, eggs and sugar; there is no mention of dairy products.The Universal English Dictionary: Comprising the Etymology, Definition, and Pronunciation of All Known Words in the Language, as Well as Technical Terms Used in Art, Science, Literature, Commerce, and Law. George Routledge and Sons. John Craig, P. Austin Nuttall, 1869. p. 82 A 1661 posset pot from England \\"While culinary historians debate its exact lineage, most agree eggnog originated from the early medieval\\" British drink called posset, which was made with hot milk that was curdled with wine or ale and flavoured with spices. In the Middle Ages, posset was used as a cold and flu remedy. Posset was popular from medieval times to the 19th century. Eggs were added to some posset recipes; according to Time magazine, by the \\"13th century, monks were known to drink a posset with eggs and figs.\\" A 17th century recipe for \\"My Lord of Carlisle‚Äôs Sack-Posset\\" uses a heated mixture of cream, whole cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, eighteen egg yolks, eight egg whites, and one pint of Sack wine (a fortified white wine related to sherry). At the end, sugar, ambergris and animal musk are stirred in. Posset was traditionally served in two-handled pots. The aristocracy had costly posset pots made from silver. Eggnog is not the only mixed, sweetened alcohol drink associated with the winter season. Mulled wine or wassail is a drink made by Ancient Greeks and Romans with sweetened, spiced wine. When the drink spread to Britain, the locals switched to the more widely available alcohol, hard cider, to make their mulled beverages. During the Victorian era, Britons drank purl, \\"a heady mixture of gin, warm beer, sugar, bitter herbs, and spices\\". In the Colonial era in America, the drink was transformed into an \\"ale-and-rum-based flip\\" warmed with a hot poker. Development Alcoholic drinks were originally served in wooden cups called \\"noggins\\". In Britain, the drink was originally popular among the aristocracy. \\"Milk, eggs, and sherry were foods of the wealthy, so eggnog was often used in toasts to prosperity and good health.\\" Those who could afford milk and eggs and costly spirits mixed the eggnog with brandy, Madeira wine or sherry to make a drink similar to modern alcoholic egg nog. The drink crossed the Atlantic to the British colonies during the 18th century. Since brandy and wine were heavily taxed, rum from the Triangular Trade with the Caribbean was a cost-effective substitute. The inexpensive liquor, coupled with plentiful farm and dairy products available to colonists, helped the drink become very popular in America. When the supply of rum to the newly founded United States was reduced as a consequence of the American Revolutionary War, Americans turned to domestic whiskey, and eventually bourbon in particular, as a substitute. In places in the American colonies where even bourbon was too expensive, homemade moonshine spirits were added to eggnog. Eggnog \\"became tied to the holidays\\" when it was adopted in the United States in the 1700s. Eggnog \\"seems to have been popular on both sides of the Atlantic\\" in the 18th century. A hot Tom & Jerry cocktail Records show that the first US President, George Washington, \\"served an eggnog-like drink to visitors\\" which included \\"rye whiskey, rum, and sherry.\\" The President's recipe called for a variety of alcoholic beverages along with the dairy and egg ingredients: \\"One quart cream, one quart milk, one dozen tablespoons sugar, one pint brandy, 1/2 pint rye whiskey, 1/2 pint Jamaica rum, [and] 1/4 pint sherry.\\" The recipe instructs cooks to \\"mix [the] liquor first, then separate yolks and whites of eggs, add sugar to beaten yolks, mix well. Add milk and cream, slowly beating. Beat whites of eggs until stiff and fold slowly into mixture. Let set in cool place for several days. Taste frequently.\\" \\"Tom and Jerry is a form of hot eggnog [cocktail] that was once popular.\\" The Tom and Jerry was invented by British journalist Pierce Egan in the 1820s, using brandy and rum added to eggnog and served hot, usually in a mug or a bowl. It is a traditional Christmastime cocktail in the United States. Isaac Weld, Junior, in his book Travels Through the States of North America and the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, during the years 1795, 1796, and 1797 (published in 1800) wrote: \\"The American travellers, before they pursued their journey, took a hearty draught each, according to custom, of egg-nog, a mixture composed of new milk, eggs, rum, and sugar, beat up together\\". In a similar way to how posset was drunk as a cold remedy in the Medieval era, there is evidence that eggnog was also used as a medical treatment. An 1892 scientific journal article proposes the use of eggnog to treat \\"grippe\\", commonly known as the \\"flu\\", along with ammonium chloride to treat the cough and quinine to cure the illness. The Medical Brief: A Monthly Journal of Scientific Medicine and Surgery, Volume 20, 1892. p. 187 In the American South, eggnog is made with bourbon. Eggnog is called \\"coquito\\" in Puerto Rico, where rum and fresh coconut juice or coconut milk are used in its preparation. Mexican eggnog, also known as \\"rompope\\", was developed in Santa Clara. It differs from regular eggnog in its use of Mexican cinnamon and rum or grain alcohol. In Peru, eggnog is called \\"biblia con pisco\\", and it is made with a Peruvian pomace brandy called pisco.\\" German eggnog, called \\"biersuppe\\", is made with beer. \\"Eierpunsch is a German version of eggnog made with white wine\\", eggs, sugar, cloves, tea, lemon or lime juice and cinnamon. Another recipe dating from 1904 calls for eggs, lemon juice, sugar, white wine, water and rum. In Iceland, eggnog \\"is served hot as a dessert.\\" Ingredients and serving style Traditional eggnog typically consists of milk, cream, sugar, raw eggs and flavourings. Homemade Traditional homemade eggnog is made of milk or cream, sugar, raw eggs, one or more alcoholic spirits, and spices, often vanilla or nutmeg and in some recipes, cloves. Some recipes call for the eggs to be separated so that the egg whites can be whipped until they are thick; this gives the drink a frothy texture. American food show presenter Alton Brown points out that based on its ingredients, eggnog is \\"almost identical to ice cream. It is technically just a stirred custard made of milk and egg\\". Homemade recipes may use vanilla ice cream blended into the beverage, particularly when the goal is to create a chilled drink. Some recipes call for condensed milk or evaporated milk in addition to milk and cream. Acidophilus milk, a fermented milk product, has been used to make egg nog. While some recipes call for unwhipped heavy cream, in some recipes, whipped cream is added to the mixture, which gives it a frothier texture. Various sweeteners are used, such as white sugar, brown sugar and maple syrup. There are variations in ingredients in different recipes. Traditional eggnog has a significant fat content, due to the use of cream, and a high sugar content. Ingredients vary significantly between different recipes. Alcohol used in different national and regional versions of eggnog include brandy, cognac, bourbon, whiskey, sherry, rum and grain alcohol. Canadian chef Heidi Fink states that one of the reasons people are making less homemade eggnog is that the beverage is expensive to make, due to its use of substantial quantities of cream, eggs, and spirits. Concerns about the safety of raw eggs may be another reason for the decline in homemade eggnog making. Commercially prepared Modern commercial eggnog manufacturers add gelatin and other thickeners, a cost-savings measure that enables manufacturers to produce a thick beverage while using less egg and cream. \\"Commercial eggnog tends to contain less eggs than homemade nog\\". In the US, FDA regulations only require that 1.0 percent of a product's final weight be made up of egg yolk solids for it to bear the eggnog name. Under current U.S. law, commercial products sold as eggnog are permitted to contain milk, sugar, modified milk ingredients, glucose-fructose, water, carrageenan, guar gum, natural and artificial flavorings, spices, monoglycerides, and colorings. In Canada, the National Dairy Code defines eggnog as: \\"food made from milk and cream containing milk and cream which has been flavoured and sweetened. The food shall contain not less than 3.25 per cent milk fat and not less than 23 per cent total solids.\\" In Canada, if a commercial product does not contain eggs, it cannot be called \\"eggnog\\". Ready-made eggnog versions are seasonally available with different spirits, or without alcohol, to be drunk as bought or used as \\"mixes\\" with all the ingredients except the liquor, to be added as desired. While eggnog is mostly available from American Thanksgiving through to Christmas, in some regions a marshmallow-flavoured version is sold at Easter. In the 2000s, low-fat and sugar-free commercial versions are available using sugar substitutes and skimmed or low fat milk. The Dutch liqueur advocaat, with around 20% alcohol, and German Eierlik√∂r, are essentially an eggnog, although the former only tends to have a similar consistency to eggnog in export markets. In the Netherlands, advocaat is normally available as a thick and creamy confection which is either consumed as is or used as a cream for various desserts. =Non-dairy and vegan versions= \\"Silk Nog,\\" a commercial soy milk eggnog Some North American manufacturers offer soy-, almond-, rice- or coconut milk-based alternatives for vegans and those with dairy allergies, lactose intolerance or other dietary restrictions. The history of non-dairy eggnogs goes back to 1899 when Almeda Lambert, in her Guide for Nut Cookery, gave a recipe for \\"Egg Nog\\" made using coconut cream, eggs, and sugar. In 1973, Eunice Farmilant, in The Natural Foods Sweet-Tooth Cookbook, gave a more modern non-dairy eggnog recipe. In 1981, Grain Country of Los Angeles, California, introduced Grain Nog, the earliest non-dairy and vegan eggnog. Vegan means that a food contains no animal products, including milk or eggs. Based on amazake (a traditional Japanese fermented rice beverage) and containing no eggs, Grain Nog was available in plain, strawberry, and carob flavors. Also in 1981, Redwood Valley Soyfoods Unlimited (California) introduced \\"Soynog\\", the earliest soy- based non-dairy and vegan eggnog based on soy milk and tofu (added for thickness). It was renamed Lite Nog in 1982 and Tofu Nog in 1985. Serving and presentation Whether homemade or commercial eggnog is being served, toppings may be added, such as grated nutmeg or ground cinnamon, whipped cream, a cinnamon stick, chocolate shavings or a vanilla pod. Eggnog can be served in glasses, mugs or stemmed brandy snifters. Eggnog may be served to guests already poured into a glass or other container, or it may be served in a punch bowl, so that guests can serve themselves. Both homemade and commercial eggnogs are made in alcohol-free versions and recipes in which alcoholic beverages, generally brown, aged spirits such as bourbon, brandy or rum are added during preparation or directly to the cup after the nog is poured. For example, for rum, some recipes specify dark rum or spiced rum, for extra flavour. A few recipes suggest Baileys Irish Cream liqueur, apple brandy or even Guinness stout as the alcohol. Use as flavouring The distinctive spices that give eggnog its characteristic taste, including cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla, are used to create eggnog-flavoured foods and beverages. Eggnog- flavoured foods include eggnog ice cream, pie, cupcakes, rum cake, cookies, biscotti, pancake syrup, bread pudding, French toast and waffles. Eggnog- flavoured beverages include eggnog lattes (developed by Starbucks in the mid-1980s), eggnog-flavoured coffee and tea, some craft beers (e.g., eggnog stout) and eggnog milkshakes. Health and safety Raw eggs Most homemade eggnog recipes have historically included raw eggs. While the alcohol added to many homemade eggnogs is a bactericide, eggnog freshly made from raw eggs that are infected with salmonella and not heated can cause food poisoning. A very small percentage of raw eggs are infected with salmonella. In 1981 most of the residents and staff of a nursing home in the U.S. became ill with salmonellosis, and four died. The cause was almost certainly an eggnog made on the spur of the moment, with some cases caused in a secondary outbreak caused by food being handled later by people with contaminated hands.\\"Tainted Eggnog Fatal to 4 Residents of a County Nursing Home in Jersey \\", The New York Times, 7 January 1982. A later publication of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that the alcohol in eggnog is not sufficient to sterilize contaminated eggs. Using commercial pasteurized eggs or heating the milk-egg mixture sufficiently can make the drink safe; one recipe calls for heating the mixture gently, without boiling, until it thickens enough to \\"coat the back of a spoon.\\" However, aged alcoholic eggnog becomes sterilized even if made with contaminated eggs. Aging alcoholic eggnog‚Äîsometimes for as long as a year‚Äîhas been said to improve its flavor significantly, and also destroys pathogens. The Rockefeller University Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology carried out an experiment in 2010 where salmonella was added to a strong eggnog which was refrigerated and stored; the beverage still had dangerous levels of salmonella a week later, but it was all gone within three weeks. A concentration of at least 20% of alcohol (about the same amounts of alcoholic spirits and milk or cream), and refrigeration are recommended for safety.Borel, Brooke (17 December 2013), Why You Shouldn't Fear The Eggnog . popsci.com For concerns about the safety of selling products made from raw eggs and milk, the U.S. FDA has changed or altered the definition of eggnog a number of times towards artificial replacements for the large number of eggs traditionally used. FDA regulations () require eggnog to contain at least 1% egg yolk solids and at least 8.25% milk solids. Some recipes for homemade eggnog call for egg yolks to be cooked with milk into a custard to avoid potential hazards from raw eggs. Alcohol content A whiskey-spiked eggnog served as a cocktail in a bar TIME magazine states that individuals should be aware of the alcohol content of eggnog, from a responsible drinking perspective. When people make homemade alcoholic eggnog, or when they add spirits to commercially prepared eggnog, in some cases, the drink has a very high alcohol content; one columnist states that in his family Christmas tradition, \\"it's not eggnog unless you can set fire to it\\", due to high alcohol percentage. Jazz composer Charles Mingus had an eggnog recipe that contained enough alcohol, including 151 proof rum, to \\"put down an elephant\\". There is a long history of heavily alcohol-spiked eggnog. An 1894 book by a North Carolina traveler describes using \\"half gallon of brandy for an eggnog\\".Michaux, Richard Randolph. Sketches of Life in North Carolina: Embracing Incidents and Narratives, and Personal Adventures of the Author During Forty Years of Travel. With an Appendix, in which the Papacy is Shown from the Scriptures to be the Great Anti-Christ; and the False and Corrupt System is Exposed. W. C. Phillips, printer, 1894. p. 18 CNN states that some 19th century American eggnog recipes called for significant amounts of alcohol; one recipe \\"calls for three dozen eggs, half a gallon of domestic brandy, and another half-pint of French brandy.\\" The high alcohol content of traditional \\"eggnog inevitably led to problems. In 19th-century Baltimore, it was a custom for young men of the town to go from house to house on New Year‚Äôs Day, toasting their hosts in eggnog along the way. The challenge: to finish one‚Äôs rounds still standing.\\" In 2015, controversy arose over a Bloomingdale's advertisement which referred to adding alcohol to eggnog. The ad depicted a man and a woman, with the woman looking away from the man, and it was captioned \\"Spike your best friend‚Äôs eggnog when they‚Äôre not looking\\". After being widely criticized on social media websites such as Twitter as seemingly endorsing date rape and alcohol-facilitated sexual assault, Bloomingdales responded with an apology: \\"In reflection of recent feedback, the copy we used in our recent catalog was inappropriate and in poor taste. Bloomingdale‚Äôs sincerely apologizes for this error in judgment.\\" The most notable case of alcohol problems associated with the drink was the Eggnog Riot at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, on 23‚Äì25 December 1826. Alcohol possession at the academy was prohibited, along with drunkenness and intoxication, both of which could lead to expulsion.Agnew. p. xix. By 1826, concern had been raised that drinking was starting to get out of hand among the 260 cadets at the academy.Agnew. p. xviii.Agnew. p. 5. The cadets were informed that, due to the alcohol prohibition on the site, their Christmas eggnog would be alcohol-free, prompting the decision by cadets to smuggle liquor into the academy.The 1826 Christmas Eggnog Riot. ‚Äì accessed 24 December 2012. Gallons of whiskey were smuggled into the barracks to make eggnog for a Christmas Day party. This led to \\"a drunken free-for-all. Windows, furniture, and crockery were smashed; banisters were torn from walls, fights broke out. One eggnog-addled cadet tried, but failed, to shoot his commanding officer.\\" The incident resulted in the court-martialing of twenty cadets and one enlisted soldier. Neither the young Jefferson Davis nor Robert E. Lee, who were in attendance, was found guilty of any offences or expelled. Nutritional aspects According to the USDA, a one cup (250 ml) serving of eggnog contains (17% of a typical person's daily value of food energy); 34.4 grams of carbohydrates (11% of DV), including 21.4 grams of sugar; 19 grams of fat (29% of DV); and 9.7 grams of protein (19% of DV). TIME magazine's Tristan Stephenson states that eggnog's \\"alcohol and sugar provide energy, eggs supply protein, and the fat from the milk or cream gives the [wintertime] drinker the necessary \\"layers\\" to deal with the frost.\\" TIME magazine also states that with its cream, eggs and sugar ingredients, \\"eggnog can pack in upwards of 400 [kilocalories; 1700 kJ] per cup.\\" CNN states that a \\"...relatively small four- ounce [120 mL] cup of store-bought eggnog boasts a whopping (half of them from fat), nearly 10 grams of fat, and over 70 mg of cholesterol...[, which is] around a quarter of your recommended daily intake of cholesterol.\\" National Geographic writer Rebecca Rupp states that with eggnog's saturated fat, cholesterol, liquor and high calorie count, \\"...[t]here's no way this stuff is good for us.\\" Esquire states that \\"[e]ggnog is irredeemable from a nutritional standpoint. Period. The pre-packaged stuff is mostly made from high-fructose corn syrup, dairy fat, and a bunch of unlovable additives\\" and it recommends a \\"two-drink maximum\\" for health reasons. Reception and consumption Canadian brand of prepared eggnog, labelled using the French term for the drink \\"Lait de poule\\" (literally \\"Hen's milk\\"). Eggnog has a polarized reception from food critics, chefs and consumers; Esquire states that \\"there doesn't seem to be a middle ground on eggnog. You either love it or hate it\\". While some are enthusiastic advocates of the beverage, others are critical of its taste or consistency. The CBC states that the \\"ancient drink can be quite divisive.\\" The Guardian writer Andrew Shanahan described eggnog in a critical manner in 2006: \\"People rarely get it right, but even if you do it still tastes horrible. The smell is like an omelette and the consistency defies belief. It lurches around the glass like partially-sentient sludge.\\" TIME magazine's Tristan Stephenson states that eggnog is popular because it \\"[t]ick[s] every single one of the guilt/pleasure boxes, on account of being little more than fat, sugar, and alcohol\\", which makes it \\"so ludicrously delicious\\", a sort of \\"alcoholic custard\\". The New Yorker writer Carmen Maria Machado described an anti-eggnog article in the Times as a \\"buzzkill\\" for providing the drink's calorie count; Machado argues that \\"[e]ggnog‚Äôs decadence should not be considered sinful; indeed, it is one of those foods whose low-fat variations I believe to be a kind of crime.\\" Canadian chef Heidi Fink, from Victoria, praises homemade nog but criticizes the \\"slimy\\" \\"glop you can buy in supermarkets\\". Chowhound criticized Trader Joe's chocolate-flavoured eggnog, calling it \\"ghastly\\". The New York Daily News argued against the use of eggnog flavouring (and other flavours, like blueberry), in coffee, calling the results \\"Franken-coffee\\". Consumption in the United States in 2019 was 53.5 million bottles purchased and Americans spent $185 million on eggnog. The consumption of egg nog was down 42 percent since 1969. The drink is more popular in the United States in the 2000s than the United Kingdom, despite the fact that it was developed in Britain and then transplanted to the American colonies in the 1700s. As of 2014, Canadians are drinking less store-bought eggnog. They drank 5.3 million litres of commercial eggnog in 2014's Christmas period; this is less than in 1994, when they drank eight million litres. Some of the possible reasons for the decline in Canadian eggnog consumption could be concerns about raw eggs (for homemade eggnog) and health concerns, regarding the fat and sugar content of the drink.

It causes decreased synthesis of cortisol and sex steroids, with resulting increase in mineralocorticoid production. Thus, common symptoms include mild hypocortisolism, ambiguous genitalia in genetic males or failure of the ovaries to function at puberty in genetic females, and hypokalemic hypertension (respectively). However, partial (incomplete) deficiency is notable for having inconsistent symptoms between patients, and affected genetic (XX) females may be wholly asymptomatic except for infertility. Pathophysiology 17Œ±-hydroxylase converts pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17Œ±-hydroxy forms. It corresponds to the red arrows in this reaction scheme. This form of CAH results from deficiency of the enzyme 17Œ±-hydroxylase (also called CYP17A1). It accounts for less than 5% of the cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with a reported incidence of about 1 in 1,000,000 births. The most common abnormal alleles of this condition impair both the 17Œ±-hydroxylase activity and the 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A1. Like other forms of CAH, 17Œ±-hydroxylase deficiency impairs the efficiency of cortisol synthesis, resulting in high levels of ACTH secretion and hyperplasia of the adrenal glands. Clinical effects of this condition include overproduction of mineralocorticoids and deficiency of prenatal and pubertal sex steroids. CYP17A1 functions in steroidogenesis, where it converts pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17Œ±-hydroxy forms. The enzyme itself is attached to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex and gonads. CYP17A1 functions as both a 17Œ±-hydroxylase and a 17,20-lyase. The dual activities mediate three key transformations in cortisol and sex steroid synthesis: * As 17Œ±-hydroxylase it mediates pregnenolone ‚Üí 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone * and progesterone ‚Üí 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone. * As 17,20-lyase it mediates 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone ‚Üí DHEA. * An expected second 17,20-lyase reaction (17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone ‚Üí androstenedione) is mediated so inefficiently in humans as to be of no known significance. The hydroxylase reactions are part of the synthetic pathway to cortisol as well as sex steroids, but the lyase reaction is only necessary for sex steroid synthesis. Different alleles of the CYP17A1 gene result in enzyme molecules with a range of impaired or reduced function that produces a range of clinical problems. The dual enzyme activities were for many decades assumed to represent two entirely different genes and enzymes. Thus, medical textbooks and nosologies until quite recently described two different diseases: 17Œ±-hydroxylase deficient CAH, and a distinct and even rarer defect of sex steroid synthesis termed 17,20-lyase deficiency (which is not a form of CAH). In the last decade it has become clearer that the two diseases are different forms of defects of the same gene. However, the clinical features of the two types of impairment are distinct enough that they are described separately in the following sections. Mineralocorticoid effects The adrenal cortex is hyperplastic and overstimulated, with no impairment of the mineralocorticoid pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, corticosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion, blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some persons with 17Œ±-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% do so by late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by hypokalemia due to urinary potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. These features of mineralocorticoid excess are the major clinical clue distinguishing the more complete 17Œ±-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex steroids. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal, and lowers blood pressure. Glucocorticoid effects Although production of cortisol is too inefficient to normalize ACTH, the 50-100-fold elevations of corticosterone have enough weak glucocorticoid activity to prevent glucocorticoid deficiency and adrenal crisis. Sex steroid effects Genetic XX females affected by total 17Œ±-hydroxylase deficiency are born with normal female internal and external anatomy. At the expected time of puberty neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex steroids, so neither breast development nor pubic hair appear. Investigation of delayed puberty yields elevated gonadotropins and normal karyotype, while imaging confirms the presence of ovaries and an infantile uterus. Discovery of hypertension and hypokalemic alkalosis usually suggests the presence of one of the proximal forms of CAH, and the characteristic mineralocorticoid elevations confirm the specific diagnosis. Milder forms of this deficiency in genetic females allow some degree of sexual development, with variable reproductive system dysregulation that can include incomplete Tanner scale development, retrograde sexual development, irregular menstruation, early menopause, or ‚Äì in very mild cases ‚Äì no physical symptoms beyond infertility. Evidence suggests that only 5% of normal enzyme activity may be enough to allow at least the physical changes of female puberty, if not ovulation and fertility. In women with mild cases, elevated blood pressure and/or infertility is the presenting clinical problem. 17Œ±-hydroxylase deficiency in genetic males (XY) results in moderate to severe reduction of fetal testosterone production by adrenals and testes. Undervirilization is variable and sometimes complete. The appearance of the external genitalia ranges from normal female to ambiguous to mildly underdeveloped male. The most commonly described phenotype is a small phallus, perineal hypospadias, small blind pseudovaginal pouch, and intra-abdominal or inguinal testes. Wolffian duct derivatives are hypoplastic or normal, depending on degree of testosterone deficiency. Some of those with partial virilization develop gynecomastia at puberty even though masculinization is reduced. The presence of hypertension in the majority distinguishes them from other forms of partial androgen deficiency or insensitivity. Fertility is impaired in those with more than minimal testosterone deficiency. 17,20-lyase deficiency A very small number of people have reportedly had an abnormal allele that resulted primarily in a reduction of 17,20-lyase activity, rather than both the hydroxylase and lyase activities as described above. In these people the defect had the effect of an isolated impairment of sex steroid (e.g., DHEA in the adrenal, but also gonadal testosterone and estrogens) synthesis, whereas mineralocorticoid (e.g., aldosterone) and glucocorticoid (e.g., cortisol) levels remain normal. Normal aldosterone level can be attributed to the fact that aldosterone is independent of hypothalamus-pituitary axis feedback system, being mainly controlled by the level of serum potassium. Because of the normal aldosterone level, hypertension is not expected. Normal cortisol level can be explained by the strong negative feedback mechanism of cortisol on hypothalamus-pituitary axis system. That is, in the beginning, 17,20-lyase deficiency will block synthesis of sex steroid hormones, forcing the pathways to produce more cortisol. However, the initial excess of cortisol is rapidly corrected by negative feedback mechanism‚Äîhigh cortisol decreases secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from zona fasciculata of adrenal gland. Thus, there is no mineralocorticoid overproduction. Also, there is no adrenal hyperplasia. It has also been observed in patients that the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level remains in the normal range. The reason for this is still unclear. The sex steroid deficiency produces effects similar to 17Œ±-hydroxylase deficiency. Severely affected genetic females (XX) are born with normal internal and external genitalia and there are no clues to abnormality until adolescence, when the androgenic and estrogenic signs (e.g., breasts and pubic hair) of puberty fail to occur. Gonadotropins are high and the uterus infantile in size. The ovaries may contain enlarged follicular cysts, and ovulation may not occur even after replacement of estrogen. Management Hypertension and mineralocorticoid excess is treated with glucocorticoid replacement, as in other forms of CAH. Most genetic females with both forms of the deficiency will need replacement estrogen to induce puberty. Most will also need periodic progestin to regularize menses. Fertility is usually reduced because egg maturation and ovulation is poorly supported by the reduced intra-ovarian steroid production. The most difficult management decisions are posed by the more ambiguous genetic (XY) males. Most who are severely undervirilized, looking more female than male, are raised as females with surgical removal of the nonfunctional testes. If raised as males, a brief course of testosterone can be given in infancy to induce growth of the penis. Surgery may be able to repair the hypospadias. The testes should be salvaged by orchiopexy if possible. Testosterone must be replaced in order for puberty to occur and continued throughout adult life.

A close look at the spoiler (the parts of the wing that are raised up) during the landing of an Airbus A321. A view of the right wing of a Boeing 767-300ER during descent with spoilers partially deployed. Spoilers deployed to slow down for descent on a Qantas Boeing 737-800. Extended spoilers are intended to increase the lift-induced drag by spoiling the spanwise lift distribution across the wing. The glider shown is a Slingsby Capstan. In aeronautics, a spoiler (sometimes called a lift spoiler or lift dumper) is a device which intentionally reduces the lift component of an airfoil in a controlled way. Most often, spoilers are plates on the top surface of a wing that can be extended upward into the airflow to spoil the streamline flow. By so doing, the spoiler creates a controlled stall over the portion of the wing behind it, greatly reducing the lift of that wing section. Spoilers differ from airbrakes in that airbrakes are designed to increase drag without affecting lift, while spoilers reduce lift as well as increasing drag. Spoilers fall into two categories: those that are deployed at controlled angles during flight to increase descent rate or control roll, and those that are fully deployed immediately on landing to greatly reduce lift (\\"lift dumpers\\") and increase drag. In modern fly-by-wire aircraft, the same set of control surfaces serve both functions. Spoilers are used by nearly every glider (sailplane) to control their rate of descent and thus achieve a controlled landing. An increased rate of descent can also be achieved by lowering the nose of an aircraft, but this would result in increased speed. Spoilers enable the approach to be made at a safe speed for landing. Airliners are almost always fitted with spoilers. Spoilers are used to increase descent rate without increasing speed. Their use is often limited, however, as the turbulent airflow that develops behind them causes noise and vibration, which may cause discomfort to passengers. Spoilers may also be differentially operated for roll control instead of ailerons; Martin Aircraft was the first company to develop such spoilers in 1948.\\"Spoilers Aid Aileron Control.\\" Popular Science, August 1948, p. 91. On landing, however, the spoilers are nearly always fully deployed to help slow the aircraft. The increase in form drag created by the spoilers directly assists the braking effect. However, the real gain comes as the spoilers cause a dramatic loss of lift and hence the weight of the aircraft is transferred from the wings to the undercarriage, allowing the wheels to be mechanically braked with less tendency to skid. In air-cooled piston engine aircraft, spoilers may be needed to avoid shock cooling the engines. In a descent without spoilers, air speed is increased and the engine will be at low power, producing less heat than normal. The engine may cool too rapidly, resulting in stuck valves, cracked cylinders or other problems. Spoilers alleviate the situation by allowing the aircraft to descend at a desired rate while letting the engine run at a power setting that keeps it from cooling too quickly (especially true for turbocharged piston engines, which generate higher temperatures than normally aspirated engines). Spoiler controls Spoiler controls can be used for roll control (outboard or mid-span spoilers) or descent control (inboard spoilers). Some aircraft use spoilers in combination with or in lieu of ailerons for roll control, primarily to reduce adverse yaw when rudder input is limited by higher speeds. For such spoilers the term spoileron has been coined. In the case of a spoileron, in order for it to be used as a control surface, it is raised on one wing only, thus decreasing lift and increasing drag, causing roll and yaw. Spoilerons also avoid the problem of control reversal that affects ailerons. Almost all modern jet airliners are fitted with inboard lift spoilers which are used together during descent to increase the rate of descent and control speed. Some aircraft use lift spoilers on landing approach to control descent without changing the aircraft's attitude. One jet airliner not fitted with lift spoilers was the Douglas DC-8 which used reverse thrust in flight on the two inboard engines to control descent speed (however the aircraft was fitted with lift dumpers). The Lockheed Tristar was fitted with a system called Direct Lift Control using the spoilers on landing approach to control descent. Airbus aircraft with fly-by-wire control utilise wide-span spoilers for descent control, spoilerons, gust alleviation, and lift dumpers. Especially on landing approach, the full width of spoilers can be seen controlling the aircraft's descent rate and bank. Lift dumpers Lift dumpers are a special type of spoiler extending along much of the wing's length and designed to dump as much lift as possible on landing. Lift dumpers have only two positions, deployed and retracted. Lift dumpers have three main functions: putting most of the weight of the aircraft on the wheels for maximum braking effect, increasing form drag, and preventing aircraft 'bounce' on landing. Lift dumpers are almost always deployed automatically on touch down. The flight deck control has three positions: off, automatic ('armed'), and manual (rarely used). On landing approach 'automatic' is selected and, at the moment of touchdown, lift dumpers are deployed in a fraction of a second, with flight control spoilers also being raised automatically as additional lift dumpers. Virtually all modern jet aircraft are fitted with lift dumpers. The British Aerospace 146 is fitted with particularly wide span spoilers to generate additional drag and make reverse thrust unnecessary. A number of accidents have been caused either by inadvertently deploying lift dumpers on landing approach, or forgetting to set them to 'automatic'.

The plane's spoilers may have been their only method of braking at speed. The plane slid off the runway, over a major highway, and ploughed into a warehouse, killing all 186 on board as well as several on the ground. It was Brazil's worst aviation disaster.

Hart, a political unknown and a LaRouche movement activist since the age of 17, unexpectedly won the Democratic Party's nomination. Her opponent, Aurelia Pucinski, came from a politically prominent family and was supported by the party organization. On March 19, 1986, Hart celebrated her victory of the previous day, saying \\"I'm going to revive the spirit of Abraham Lincoln and General Patton. We're going to roll our tanks down State Street.\\" Prominent Democrats nationwide opposed Hart's candidacy, with Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk saying \\"Good Lord, we have a problem here.\\" Democratic gubernatorial candidate Adlai Stevenson III refused to run on the same slate with Hart and the LaRouche-supported candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Mark J. Fairchild. He described Hart, who is Jewish, and Fairchild as \\"neo-Nazis... who preach anti-Semitism, who cavort with the Ku Klux Klan, and who want to destroy labour unions.\\"Chapter 13, Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism Instead, Stevenson formed the Solidarity Party and ran with Jane Spirgel as the Secretary of State nominee. Hart achieved 15% of the vote, with Spirgel taking 17%. Hart and Spirgel's opponent, Republican incumbent Jim Edgar, won the election by the largest margin in any statewide election in Illinois history, with 1.574 million votes (67%). Following the election Hart defiantly said, \\"Victory is not defined by your petty election.\\"Chicago Tribune November 6, 1986 Hart appeared in the news again in the summer of 1986 when she threw a pound of raw liver, as a symbolic \\"pound of flesh\\", at the feet of Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland, to protest what she perceived as his support for the International Monetary Fund. After initially failing to appear to answer the charges, she was fined $500 for disorderly conduct. Hart opposed Pucinski again in 1988, this time for the Democratic nomination for Clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court, which Pucinski won. When Hart applied for the nomination for Secretary of State again in 1990 she did not qualify due to insufficient signatures on her petition. She subsequently retired from public life. In 2007, one-time running mate Fairchild told a reporter that Hart was no longer with the LaRouche movement. Political significance Hart ran on the LaRouche platform, including measures to classify AIDS as a communicable disease \\"and give health officials the power to test and quarantine where needed,\\" investigation of supposed drug smuggling cartels protected by Henry Kissinger and Katharine Graham, and strong support for the Strategic Defense Initiative and nuclear power. Ever since the 1986 election the Hart candidacy has been discussed and studied by academics, and journalists. One theory is that she won the 1986 Democratic nomination over Pucinski because \\"[N]o one had heard those foreign-sounding names [Sangmeister and Pucinski] ... people voted for white bread and American-sounding (i.e., WASP) names, knowing absolutely nothing about the candidates.\\" A similar theory is that she won because her name caused voters to connect her with then-prominent Democrat Gary Hart (of Colorado). Others blame Stevenson for his inept campaigning for the ticket and voters for their apathy. Dennis King in Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism (1989) cites evidence that some of Hart's support resulted from below- the-radar organizing and campaigning in farm communities and rust belt towns.

It was established as a national park in 1954 and disestablished as such in 2014, when it was replaced by a legal entity named Te Urewera. It was the largest of four national parks in the North Island and the most isolated rainforest in the region. Covering an area of approximately 2,127 km¬≤, it was in the north of the Hawke's Bay region of the North Island. SH38 is the only road that leads through the park. The road is unsealed over 74 km. On 28 July 1954, the catchment areas of Lake Waikaremoana, Lake Waikareiti and other Crown reserves were gazetted as a national park, and by 1957 proposals were well underway to add the rest of the Crown land in Te Urewera north of Ruatahuna. This proposal was formalised in November 1957 when an additional 1,350 km¬≤ were added. Further additions were made in 1962, 1975 and 1979, with smaller acquisitions and boundary alterations in the intervening period. The lake bed and MƒÅori enclaves were not included in the park gazetting. The Crown had leased the lake bed, which was managed by the Department of Conservation. Te Urewera is the traditional home of the Tuhoe people. Due to its geographical isolation, it was one of the last regions to be claimed by the British during colonisation in the 19th century. In March 2013, Tuhoe signed a deed of settlement, settling the tribe's claims at the Waitangi Tribunal. Under the deal, Tuhoe will get $170 million and more control over Te Urewera. Te Urewera ceased to be a national park under the Te Urewera Act 2014, but the new entity still meets the International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria for Category II ‚Äì National Park. The area is now administered by the Te Urewera Board which comprises joint T≈´hoe and Crown membership. It is still open to the public and the Department of Conservation will continue to work in Te Urewera and maintain the tracks and facilities in conjunction with the Board. It is the first natural resource in the world to be awarded the same legal rights as a person.

The real presence of Christ in the Eucharist is a term used in Christian theology to express the doctrine that Jesus is present in the Eucharist, not merely symbolically or metaphorically. There are a number of different views in the understanding of the meaning of the term \\"real presence\\" among Christian confessions which accept it, including Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Church of the East, the Moravian Church, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, Methodism, and Reformed Christianity. These differences primarily concern \\"the mode of Christ's presence in the Lord‚Äôs Supper\\". Efforts at mutual understanding of the range of beliefs by these Churches led in the 1980s to consultations on Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry by the World Council of Churches. By contrast, the term is rejected or interpreted in light of \\"remembrance\\" stated in the New Testament by General Baptists, Anabaptists, the Plymouth Brethren, some non- denominational Churches, as well as those identifying with liberal Christianity, and segments of the Restoration Movement, such as Jehovah's Witnesses.What Does The Bible Really Teach?, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2005, p. 207.\\"Discerning What We Are ‚Äî At Memorial Time\\", The Watchtower, February 15, 1990, p. 16. History Eucharistic theology as a branch of Christian theology developed during the medieval period; before that, during the early medieval period theological disputes had focused mostly on questions of Christology. In the 9th century, Charles the Bald posed two unclearly formulated questions: whether the faithful receive the body of Christ in mystery or in truth and whether the body is the same that was born of Mary and suffered on the cross. Ratramnus understood \\"in truth\\" to mean simply \\"what is perceptible to the senses\\", \\"plain unvarnished reality\\" (rei manifestae demonstratio), and declared that the consecration leaves the bread and wine unchanged in their outward appearance and thus, insofar as these are signs of the body and blood of Christ hidden under the veil of the signs, the faithful receive the body of Christ not in veritate, but in figura, in mysterio, in virtute (figure, mystery, power). Ratramnus opposed Capharnaitic tendencies but in no way betrayed a symbolist understanding such as that of 11th-century Berengarius.Lexikon f√ºr Theologie und Kirche. Vol. VIII. Herder; 1963. col. 1001.George E. McCracken. Early Medieval Theology. Westminster John Knox Press; 2 January 1956. . p. 92. Radbertus, on the other hand, developed the realism of the Gallican and Roman liturgy and the Ambrosian theology of the identity of the sacramental and historical body of the Lord. The dispute ended with Radbertus's letter to Frudiger, in which he stressed further the identity of the sacramental and historical body of Christ, but met the opposing view to the extent of emphasizing the spiritual nature of the sacramental body.Michael Buchberger. Lexikon f√ºr Theologie und Kirche. Vol. I. Herder; 1957. Abendmahlstreit. col. 33. Friedrich Kempf comments: \\"Since Paschasius had identified the Eucharistic and the historical body of the Lord without more precisely explaining the Eucharistic species, his teaching could and probably did promote a grossly materialistic 'Capharanaitic' interpretation\\".Handbook of Church History: From the High Middle Ages to the eve of the Reformation, by H. Beck. Burns & Oates; 1969. p. 467. The question of the nature of the Eucharist became virulent for a second time in the Western Church in the 11th century, when Berengar of Tours denied that any material change in the elements was needed to explain the Eucharistic presence. This caused a controversy which led to the explicit clarification of the Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ), article Berengar of Tours In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council used the word transubstantiated in its profession of faith, when speaking of the change that takes place in the Eucharist. It was only later in the 13th century that Aristotelian metaphysics was accepted and a philosophical elaboration in line with that metaphysics was developed, which found classic formulation in the teaching of Saint Thomas Aquinas.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ), article Transubstantiation It was only then that scholasticism cast Christian theology in the terms of Aristotelianism. During the later medieval period, the question was debated within the Western Church. Following the Protestant Reformation, it became a central topic of division between the various emerging confessions. The Lutheran doctrine of the real presence, known as the \\"sacramental union\\", was formulated in the Augsburg Confession of 1530. Luther decidedly supported this doctrine, publishing The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ‚ÄîAgainst the Fanatics in 1526. Saying that \\"bread and body are two distinct substances\\", he declared that \\"out of two kinds of objects a union has taken place, which I shall call a 'sacramental union'\\".Weimar Ausgabe 26, 442.23; Luther's Works 37, 299-300. Thus, the main theological division in this question, turned out to be not between Catholicism and Protestantism, but within Protestantism, especially between Luther and Zwingli, who discussed the question at the Marburg Colloquy of 1529 but who failed to come to an agreement. Zwingli's view became associated with the term Memorialism, suggesting an understanding of the Eucharist held purely \\"in memory of\\" Christ. While this accurately describes the position of the Anabaptists and derived traditions, it is not the position held by Zwingli himself, who affirmed that Christ is truly (in substance), though not naturally (physically) present in the sacrament. The position of the Anglican Church on this matter (the real presence) is clear and highlighted in the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion: It is therefore inaccurate to declare that the dogma of transubstantiation, or the real presence, is accepted in any way by the Anglican Church as a whole.Daniels E, The prayer Book, its History Language and Content, 1892.Moorman, J. R. H. \\"A History of the Church in England\\" (1980, p .214) The Council of Trent, held 1545-1563 in reaction to the Protestant Reformation and initiating the Catholic Counter-Reformation, promulgated the view of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist as true, real, and substantial, and declared that, \\"by the consecration of the bread and of the wine, a conversion is made of the whole substance of the bread into the substance (substantia) of the body of Christ our Lord, and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of His blood; which conversion is, by the holy Catholic Church, suitably and properly called Transubstantiation\\". The Scholastic, Aristotelian philosophy of substance was not included in the Council's definitive teaching, but rather the more general idea of \\"substance\\" that had predated Thomas Aquinas. Eastern Orthodoxy did not become involved in the dispute prior to the 17th century. It became virulent in 1629, when Cyril Lucaris denied the doctrine of transubstantiation, using the Greek translation metousiosis for the concept. To counter the teaching of Lucaris, Metropolitan Petro Mohyla of Kiev drew up in Latin an Orthodox Confession in defense of transubstantiation. This Confession was approved by all the Greek-speaking Patriarchs (those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem) in 1643, and again by the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem (also referred to as the Council of Bethlehem).  Views   Catholic view: true, real and substantial  Ecce Agnus Dei (\\"Behold the Lamb of God\\") at Mass The Catholic Church declares that the presence of Christ in the Eucharist is true, real, and substantial.Council of Trent, Session XIII, Sacrament of the Eucharist By saying Christ is truly present in the Eucharist, it excludes any understanding of the presence as merely that of a sign or figure. By stating that his presence in the Eucharist is real, it defines it as objective and independent of the thoughts and feelings of the participants, whether they have faith or not: lack of faith may make reception of the sacrament fruitless for holiness, but it does not make his presence unreal. In the third place, the Catholic Church describes the presence of Christ in the Eucharist as substantial, that is, involving the underlying substance, not the appearances of bread and wine. These maintain all their physical properties as before: unlike what happens when the appearance of something or somebody is altered but the basic reality remains the same, it is the teaching of the Catholic Church that in the Eucharist the appearance is quite unchanged, but the basic reality has become the body and blood of Christ. The change from bread and wine to a presence of Christ that is true, real, and substantial is called ‚Äì fittingly and properly, in the view of the Catholic Church ‚Äì transubstantiation. The Catholic Church does not consider the term \\"transubstantiation\\" an explanation of the change: it declares that the change by which the signs of bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ occurs \\"in a way surpassing understanding\\". One hymn of the Church, \\"Ave Verum Corpus\\", greets Christ in the Eucharist as follows (in translation from the original Latin): \\"Hail, true body, born of Mary Virgin, and which truly suffered and was immolated on the cross for mankind!\\"\\"Ave verum corpus natum /de Maria Virgine; /vere passum, immolatum /in cruce pro homine!\\" (late-fourteenth-century hymn) The Catholic Church also holds that the presence of Christ in the Eucharist is entire: it does not see what is really in the Eucharist as a lifeless corpse and mere blood, but as the whole Christ, body and blood, soul and divinity; nor does it see the persisting outward appearances of bread and wine and their properties (such as weight and nutritional value) as a mere illusion, but objectively existing as before and unchanged. In the view of the Catholic Church, the presence of Christ in the Eucharist is of an order different from the presence of Christ in the other sacraments: in the other sacraments he is present by his power rather than by the reality of his body and blood, the basis of the description of his presence as \\"real\\".  Orthodox view: Objective Change  Eastern Orthodox Divine Liturgy. The Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, as well as the Church of the East, believe that in the Eucharist the bread and wine are objectively changed and become in a real sense the Body and Blood of Christ.[http://assyrianchurch.org.au/about-us/the- sacraments/oblation/ \\"Oblation\\", Assyrian Church of the East The theologians Brad Harper and Paul Louis Metzger state that: The Greek term metousiosis () is sometimes used by Eastern Orthodox Christians to describe the change since this term \\"is not bound up with the scholastic theory of substance and accidents\\", but it does not have official status as \\"a dogma of the Orthodox Communion. Similarly, Coptic Orthodox Christians \\"are fearful of using philosophical terms concerning the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, preferring uncritical appeals to biblical passages like 1 Cor. 10.16; 11.23-29 or the discourse in John 6.26-58.\\" While the Roman Catholic Church believes that the change \\"takes place at the words of institution or consecration\\", the Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that the \\"change takes place anywhere between the Proskomedia (the Liturgy of Preparation)\\" and \\"the Epiklesis ('calling down'), or invocation of the Holy Spirit 'upon us and upon these gifts here set forth'\\". Therefore, it teaches that \\"the gifts should be treated with reverence throughout the entirety of the service. We don't know the exact time in which the change takes place, and this is left to mystery.\\" The words of the Ethiopic liturgy are representative of the faith of Oriental Orthodoxy: \\"I believe, I believe, I believe and profess to the last breath that this is the body and the blood of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, which he took from our Lady, the holy and immaculate Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.\\" The Eastern Orthodox Church Synod of Jerusalem declared: \\"We believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be present, not typically, nor figuratively, nor by superabundant grace, as in the other Mysteries, ... but truly and really, so that after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, the bread is transmuted, transubstantiated, converted and transformed into the true Body Itself of the Lord, Which was born in Bethlehem of the ever-Virgin Mary, was baptised in the Jordan, suffered, was buried, rose again, was received up, sitteth at the right hand of the God and Father, and is to come again in the clouds of Heaven; and the wine is converted and transubstantiated into the true Blood Itself of the Lord, Which, as He hung upon the Cross, was poured out for the life of the world.\\"Decree XVII of the Synod of Bethlehem  Lutheran: Sacramental union  A notice about the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist in Mikael Agricola Church, Helsinki.The notice reads: \\"Christ is present here.

This was first articulated in the Wittenberg Concord of 1536 in the formula: Nihil habet rationem sacramenti extra usum a Christo institutum (\\"Nothing has the character of a sacrament apart from the use instituted by Christ\\"). Some Lutherans use this formula as their rationale for opposing in the church the reservation of the consecrated elements, private Masses, the practice of Corpus Christi, and the belief that the reliqu√¶ (what remains of the consecrated elements after all have communed in the worship service) are still sacramentally united to the Body and Blood of Christ. This interpretation is not universal among Lutherans. The consecrated elements are treated with reverence; and, in some Lutheran churches, are reserved as in Orthodox, Catholic, and Anglican practice. The external Eucharistic adoration is usually not practiced by most Lutherans except for bowing, genuflecting, and kneeling to receive the Eucharist from the Words of Institution and elevation to reception of the holy meal. The reliqu√¶ traditionally are consumed by the celebrant after the people have communed, except that a small amount may be reserved for delivery to those too ill or infirm to attend the service. In this case, the consecrated elements are to be delivered quickly, preserving the connection between the communion of the ill person and that of the congregation gathered in public Divine Service. Lutherans use the terms \\"in, with and under the forms of consecrated bread and wine\\" and \\"Sacramental Union\\" to distinguish their understanding of the Eucharist from those of the Reformed and other traditions.  Anglican  Eucharist in an Episcopal church Anglicans prefer a view of objective presence that maintains a definitive change, but allows how that change occurs to remain a mystery. Likewise, Methodists postulate a par excellence presence as being a \\"Holy Mystery\\". Anglicans generally and officially believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but the specific forms of that belief range from a corporeal presence (real objective presence), sometimes even with Eucharistic adoration (mainly high church Anglo-Catholics), to belief in a pneumatic presence (mainly low church Reformed Anglicans). In Anglican theology, a sacrament is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. In the Eucharist, the outward and visible sign is that of bread and wine, while the inward and spiritual grace is that of the Body and Blood of Christ. The classic Anglican aphorism with regard to the debate on the Eucharist is the poem by John Donne (1572‚Äì1631): \\"He was the Word that spake it; He took the bread and brake it; And what that Word did make it; I do believe and take it\\" (Divine Poems. On the Sacrament).Quotes ‚Äì John Donne, Classics Network. Accessed 2010-01-25. During the English Reformation the doctrine of the Church of England was strongly influenced by Continental Reformed theologians whom Cranmer had invited to England to aid with the reforms. Among these were Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Bernardino Ochino, Paul Fagius, and Jan ≈Åaski. John Calvin was also urged to come to England by Cranmer, but declined, saying that he was too involved in the Swiss reforms. Consequently, early on, the Church of England has a strong Reformed, if not particularly Calvinistic influence. The view of the Real Presence, as described in the Thirty-Nine Articles therefore bears much resemblance to the pneumatic views of Bucer, Martyr, and Calvin. The Anglican Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion contends that: For many Anglicans, whose mysticism is intensely incarnational, it is extremely important that God has used the mundane and temporal as a means of giving people the transcendent and eternal. Some have extended this view to include the idea of a presence that is in the realm of spirit and eternity, and not to be about corporeal-fleshiness. During the Oxford Movement of the 19th century, Tractarians advanced a belief in the real objective presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but maintained that the details of how He is present remain mystery of faith, a view also held by the Orthodox Church and Methodist Church. Indeed, one of the oldest Anglo-Catholic devotional societies, the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament, was founded largely to promote belief in the real objective presence of Christ in the Eucharist. From some Anglican perspectives, the real presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist does not imply that Jesus Christ is present materially or locally. This is in accord with the standard Roman Catholic view as expressed, for instance by St. Thomas Aquinas, who, while saying that the whole Christ is present in the sacrament, also said that this presence was not \\"as in a place\\".http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/TP/TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1 Summa Theologica, III, 76 Real does not mean material: the lack of the latter does not imply the absence of the former. The Eucharist is not intrinsic to Christ as a body part is to a body, but extrinsic as his instrument to convey Divine Grace. Some Anglicans see this understanding as compatible with different theories of Christ's presence‚Äîtransubstantiation, consubstantation, or virtualism‚Äîwithout getting involved in the mechanics of \\"change\\" or trying to explain a mystery of God's own doing. Anglican and Roman Catholic theologians participating in the first Anglican‚ÄîRoman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC I) declared that they had \\"reached substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist\\".See Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine from the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission and Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement. Accessed 15 October 2007. This claim was accepted by the 1988 Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops (Resolution 8), but firmly questioned in the Official Roman Catholic Response to the Final Report of ARCIC I of 1991.Hill, Christopher and Yarnold, Edward (eds), Anglicans and Roman Catholics: The Search for Unity, London SPCK/CTS, 1994, pp.18‚Äì28; pp.153‚Äì155 and pp.156‚Äì166  Methodist view: Holy Mystery  The followers of John Wesley have typically affirmed that the sacrament of Holy Communion is an instrumental Means of Grace through which the real presence of Christ is communicated to the believer, but have otherwise allowed the details to remain a mystery. In particular, Methodists reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation (see \\"Article XVIII\\" of the Articles of Religion); the Primitive Methodist Church, in its Discipline also rejects the Lollardist doctrine of consubstantiation. In 2004, the United Methodist Church affirmed its view of the sacrament and its belief in the real presence in an official document entitled This Holy Mystery: A United Methodist Understanding of Holy Communion. Of particular note here is the church's unequivocal recognition of the anamnesis as more than just a memorial but, rather, a re-presentation of Christ Jesus and His Love. :Holy Communion is remembrance, commemoration, and memorial, but this remembrance is much more than simply intellectual recalling. \\"Do this in remembrance of me\\" (Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:24‚Äì25) is anamnesis (the biblical Greek word). This dynamic action becomes re- presentation of past gracious acts of God in the present, so powerfully as to make them truly present now. Christ is risen and is alive here and now, not just remembered for what was done in the past. A United Methodist minister consecrates the elements This affirmation of real presence can be seen clearly illustrated in the language of the United Methodist Eucharistic Liturgyfor example, where, in the epiclesis of the Great Thanksgiving, the celebrating minister prays over the elements: :Pour out your Holy Spirit on us gathered here, and on these gifts of bread and wine. Make them be for us the body and blood of Christ, that we may be for the world the body of Christ, redeemed by his blood. Methodists assert that Jesus is truly present, and that the means of His presence is a \\"Holy Mystery\\". A celebrating minister will pray for the Holy Spirit to make the elements \\"be for us the body and blood of Christ\\", and the congregation can even sing, as in the third stanza of Charles Wesley's hymn Come Sinners to the Gospel Feast: :Come and partake the gospel feast, :be saved from sin, in Jesus rest; :O taste the goodness of our God, :and eat his flesh and drink his blood. The distinctive feature of the Methodist doctrine of the real presence is that the way Christ manifests His presence in the Eucharist is a sacred mystery‚Äîthe focus is that Christ is truly present in the sacrament. The Discipline of the Free Methodist Church thus teaches: Many within the Holiness Pentecostal tradition, which is largely Wesleyan-Arminian in theology as are the Methodist Churches, also affirm this understanding of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.  Moravian view: Sacramental presence  Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a bishop of the Moravian Church, stated that Holy Communion is the \\"most intimate of all connection with the person of the Saviour.\\" The Moravian Church adheres to a view known as the \\"sacramental presence\\", teaching that in the sacrament of Holy Communion:  Reformed view: real spiritual presence  A Scottish Sacrament, by Henry John Dobson Many Reformed, particularly those following John Calvin, hold that the reality of Christ's body and blood do not come corporally (physically) to the elements, but that \\"the Spirit truly unites things separated in space\\" (Calvin). This view is known as the real spiritual presence, spiritual presence, or pneumatic presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper. Following a phrase of Saint Augustine, the Calvinist view is that \\"no one bears away from this Sacrament more than is gathered with the vessel of faith\\". \\"The flesh and blood of Christ are no less truly given to the unworthy than to God's elect believers\\", Calvin said; but those who partake by faith receive benefit from Christ, and the unbelieving are condemned by partaking. By faith (not a mere mental apprehension), and in the Holy Spirit, the partaker beholds God incarnate, and in the same sense touches him with hands, so that by eating and drinking of bread and wine Christ's presence penetrates to the heart of the believer more nearly than food swallowed with the mouth can enter in. This view holds that the elements may be disposed of without ceremony, as they are not changed in an objective physical sense and, as such, the meal directs attention toward Christ's \\"bodily\\" resurrection and return. Actual practices of disposing of leftover elements vary widely. Reformed theology has traditionally taught that Jesus' body is seated in heaven at the right hand of God; therefore his body is not physically present in the elements, nor do the elements turn into his body in a physical or any objective sense. However, Reformed theology has also historically taught that when the Holy Communion is received, not only the Spirit, but also the true body and blood of Jesus Christ are received through the Spirit, but these are only received by those partakers who eat worthily (i.e., repentantly) with faith. The Holy Spirit unites the Christian with Jesus though they are separated by a great distance. See, e.g., Westminster Confession of Faith, ch. 29; Belgic Confession, Article 35. The 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, in which Reformed Baptists believe, affirms the Lord's Supper to be a means of \\"spiritual nourishment and growth\\", stating: The Congregationalist theologian Alfred Ernest Garvie explicated the Congregationalist belief regarding the pneumatic presence in The Holy Catholic Church from the Congregational Point of View: In 1997, three denominations which historically held to a Reformed view of the supper: the Reformed Church in America, the United Church of Christ and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (representative of the Continental Reformed, Congregationalist and Presbyterian traditions) signed A Formula of Agreement with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, a document which stressed that: \\"The theological diversity within our common confession provides both the complementarity needed for a full and adequate witness to the gospel (mutual affirmation) and the corrective reminder that every theological approach is a partial and incomplete witness to the Gospel (mutual admonition) (A Common Calling, page 66).\\" Hence, in seeking to come to consensus about the real presence (see open communion), the churches have affirmed the real spiritual presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper:  Zwinglian view  Huldrych Zwingli, a Swiss Reformer, taught: Those who adhere to the Zwinglian view, do so at Jesus's words about doing this in \\"remembrance\\" rather than any transformation or any physical presence. Rather, Christ is really present at the thanksgiving, and in the memory. Zwingli's words that the \\"true body of Christ is eaten in a sacramental and \\"spiritual manner\\" is understood in a way where the physical objects and actions are the spiritual reminder of what Jesus had done, that He has instituted. This comes from the belief that the historical understanding of the Early Church taught that sacraments are done in \\"contemplation of faith\\" as the \\" proclamation of salvation and the strengthening of faith in the hearts of believers\\". General Baptists, Anabaptists, the Plymouth Brethren, some non-denominational Churches see Communion (also called the Lord's Supper or the Lord's Table) as signifying the body and blood of Jesus, a memorial of the Last Supper and the Passion with symbolic and meaningful elements, which is done by the ordinance of Jesus. This view is known as Memorialism or the Zwinglian view, as it was taught by Zwingli, a Swiss Reformer. Those who hold to the memorial understanding deny the strong sense of Transubstantiation as articulated by Lanfranc in the 11th century, arguing more akin to Berengarius who was a symbolist. It is pointed out that while early Church Fathers used the language of real presence, this is not similar to a hard understanding of Transubstantiation. Rather, interpreting in the context of other early Church Father writings, those who emphasize the symbolic nature of the Eucharist, point out the symbolic language used by Tertullian, Cyprian, and others, noting a differentiation between the \\"real presence of Christ\\" being used to mean a bodily presence. Further it is understood that the dispute arose much later, in the 9th and 11th centuries, about the nature of the Eucharist. Consecration, presidency and distribution Many Christian churches holding to a doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist (for example, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican, Reformed, and Methodist) reserve to ordained clergy the function of consecrating the Eucharist, but not necessarily that of distributing the elements to communicants. Others do not speak of ordination but still reserve these functions to leaders who are given titles such as pastor, elder and deacon.

As the second son of Jos√© Roque Mariano de la Plaza Elejalde and Manuela de la Silva Palacios; his older brother, Rafael de la Plaza, was also a politician and acted as governor of Santiago del Estero Province. He studied law in Buenos Aires and obtained his doctorate in 1868, became secretary of Dalmacio V√©lez S√°rsfield and collaborated on the writing of the Argentine Civil Code, and was Treasury Minister under Nicol√°s Avellaneda (1876), later Interventor in Corrientes Province (1878) and Foreign Minister (1882) and Treasury (1883‚Äì1885) during the first Julio Argentino Roca administration. He was elected vice president for the National Union presided by Roque S√°enz Pe√±a in 1910, and assumed the presidency after the death of S√°enz Pe√±a and governed between 1914 and 1916. He died of pneumonia after retiring from politics. He was the last president of what was called the conservative period of Argentinean history. This period began in 1880 and culminated with La Plaza's loss of the presidency to the Radical Civic Union. This was all thanks to the S√°enz Pe√±a Law, which established secret, compulsory voting for all those on the electoral register, thanks to Compulsory military service.  Childhood and early life  Victorino de La Plaza was born on November 2nd 1840, in Payagosta, Salta Province, Argentina. He was the son of Jose Mariano Roque de La Plaza y Elejalde, and Maria Manuela Palacios. His brother was Rafel de La Plaza, who was governor of the province of Santiago del Estero. Upon his Father's death, his mother took charge of raising the Children. Victorino began his scholastic education at an Argentine public school, yet he stayed in that school for a short period of time, because he entered a Franciscan convent. During his childhood he did a little bit of work, he sold newspapers, sweets and empanadas that were prepared by his mother. After this, he began working as an attorney and as a scribe. Subsuqently he passed and examination before the Supreme Court of Justice, for which he obtained the title of rotary in 1859. He gained a scholarship granted by the government of the Confederation which allowed him to enter the Colegio de Uruguay. It is unknown exactly when he was admitted, but it is known that it was between 1859 and 1862. After this period of his education, he went to Buenos Aires, to enter Buenos Aires University. He proved to be an outstanding student and thus, this allowed President Miter to appoint him to the position of Second Clerk, of the National Accounting Office. He was first appointed scribe, though, in 1864.  Military career  Victorino De La Plaza had a distinctly short military career. When the Triple Alliance War began, he abandoned his university studies to join an Artillery Regiment. He was chosen to be an assistant to General Julio de Vedia; a member of the Argentinian military with a prominent role against the Mapuches and in the Triple Alliance War, who was also Governor of the Chaco National Territory. He fought in the Battles of, Estero Bellaco, on May 2, 1866, and the Battle of Tuyuti on May 24th of the same year. Subsuqently the Government of Uruguay awarded him both the, Silver Sol medal for his actions in the battle of Estero Ballaco and with the award of the, Cords of Honor for his performance at the Battle of Tuyuti. Bartolome Miter, promoted him to the rank of Captain, and have him a mention for his heroism. However, although he had performed exceptionally well he had to return to Buenos Aires due to the fact that he suffered from health problems.  Law  Upon his return to Buenos Aires, he enrolled in the Law faculty at Buenos Aires University. He graduated on July 13th, 1868 with his thesis called Credit as Capital. His godfather was Dalmacio Velez Sarsfield. Whom he worked, as a scribe, for while Dalmacio was drafting the Civil code.  Entrance into politics, and early political career.

Runners World 13 February 2014. It is similar to both mountain and fell running (also known as hill running). Mountain running may, however, include paved sections. Trail running normally takes place in warm climates, or on good paths, or tracks which are relatively easy to follow, and does not necessarily involve the significant amounts of ascent, or need for navigating skills, normal in fell running. Unlike road running and track running it generally takes place on hiking trails, often in mountainous terrain, where there can be much larger ascents and descents. It is difficult to definitively distinguish trail running from cross country running. In general, however, cross country is an IAAF-governed discipline that is typically raced over shorter distances. The number of organized trail races grew 1,000% from 2008 to 2018, from 160 to more than 1,800 globally. Runners often cite less impact stress compared to road running, as well as the landscape and non-urban environment, as primary reasons for preferring trail running. This move to nature is also reflected in a large increase in competitors in non-traditional/off-road triathlons and adventure racing in the 2010s. Related activities Fastpacking A growing number of people are participating in solo backcountry trail running trips, carrying an ultralight form of backpacking to allow faster speeds than with a traditional backpack.Kate Siber, \\"Fastpacking: What is it, and why do it?\\" Runner's World, August 6, 2009.Clint Cherepa, \\"Hike Fast, Sleep Hard: Are You Ready to Try Fastpacking?\\" Outdoors.org, August 27, 2018. Running while backpacking has been termed \\"fastpacking\\". These trips can be both difficult and dangerous, depending on length, weather and terrain. Mountain and fell running Mountain and fell running (also called hill running, particularly in Scotland) are sports that combine running and racing off-road over upland country, where the gradient climbed is a significant component. Fell is a dialect word from the north west of England where it is popular‚Äìespecially in the Lake District. Fell races require mountain navigation skills and participants carry survival equipment Unlike trail running, the routes of fell races are often unmarked, so that competitors frequently are able to choose their own route to a checkpoint. The only difference between mountain running and trail running is that a mountain running course sometimes includes paving. It is different from fell running because, (1) courses are clearly marked and avoid dangerous sections; and (2) while mountain running takes place mainly off-road, if there is significant elevation gain on the route, surfaced roads may be used. Popularity and growth According to a 2010 special report on trail running published by the Outdoor Industry Foundation, \\"4.8 million Americans ages 6 and older participated in trail running in 2009.\\" This research shows a particularly heavy following in the Mountain States, the Western US, and California. Because of the natural or serene setting, trail running is viewed as a more spiritual activity than roadside running or jogging. Another reason for growth and popularity is the continual acknowledgment of environmentalism. There is a stress among many trail-race organizers to keep these races \\"green\\" or environmentally friendly and minimize disturbance within the natural environment. Equipment alt= Many trail runners use specially designed shoes that have aggressively knobby soles that are generally more rigid than road running shoes. The usually EVA compound midsole often contain a lightweight, flexible nylon plastic layer to protect the feet from puncture wounds from sharp rocks or other objects. Since trail running takes place on softer surfaces (e.g., grass, dirt) than road races, cushioning is not as important so often the shoes are less 'cushioned' than their counterparts designed for tarmac. Additionally, trail running shoes are low to the ground which provides the best stability on uneven terrain. Recently, very thick sole running shoes are gaining popularity especially in ultra-marathons. In events over 100 miles, they were the most common type of shoe used in 2013. Other equipment includes wicking garments, water bottles, sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, gaiters, insect repellent spray, headlamps, headphones, and ivy block. Some trail runners attach lightweight crampons to the bottom of their shoes to aid with traction in the snow and on ice. An alternative way to carry water is to use a hydration bladder with drinking tube carried in a backpack, waistpack, or hydration pack. Today, there are many racing vests that are lightweight alternative which allow runners the choice of reservoir based bladder or water bottles while allowing for carrying other items such as nutrition, hydration supplements and cold weather gear. Carrying the Ten Essentials may reduce the hazards inherent in wilderness travel. Some trail runners use ultra light hiking poles or trekking poles, to increase speed and stability. Races A hill-running race in Prague Trail running races are organised globally. Due to the relatively short history of trail running as an organised sport, there are very few established organizing bodies. For example, in the United States, the American Trail Running Association was only founded in 1996 to represent trail races in the US. In the United Kingdom, the Trail Running Association was formed in 1991. The International Trail Running Association (ITRA) was founded in 2013, and was first recognized by the IAAF in 2015. Distances in races vary widely, from 5 km, to over 100 miles (161 km). Many trail races are of ultramarathon (ultra) distance. Ultras are generally accepted as having a distance of greater than 26.2 miles (42.16 km) though 50 km races are the most common 'standard' ultra distance greater than a marathon. Races of similar distance often differ significantly in terms of terrain. This makes it difficult to compare performance across different courses. This is in contrast to times over standard distances in road running, such as 10 km or marathon.  Aid stations  Aid stations supplying food and beverages are commonly located every 5 to 10 kilometers along the course. Ultramarathon aid stations are often stocked with dessert foods that provide runners with quickly digestible sugars that can provide a needed boost as their glycogen levels begin to drop. Most trail races only have a single stage, where competitors are timed over the entire duration of their run, including stops at aid stations. However, trail running stage races also exist. These multiday stage races usually offer complete support and runner amenities between stages. There are, however, stage races that provide no support apart from water and medical aid, and require competitors to carry all their equipment (food, sleeping bag, change of clothes, compass). The best- known example of such races is the Marathon des Sables, that was first held in 1986.  Trail Etiquette (Trail Ethics)  As with hiking and other activities that share trails in often sensitive wilderness environments, trail runners should comply with common leave no trace and other trail etiquette (aka Trail ethics). While trail etiquette and customs vary by country, season and outdoor (recreational) area, the common purpose of trail etiquette is to preserve the wilderness environment while ensuring the safety and enjoyment of all trail users (including people, animals, and sometimes motorized vehicles).  Trail vs. road race participation limitations  Compared to road races, there are often fewer participants as number of entries is often limited. There can be a few reasons for this: narrowness of trails, national parks (where the courses are often set) may limit the number of participants via a permitting process, safety and environmental concerns. There are many popular races such as the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc in Europe or the Western States Endurance Run in the United States that have been forced to limit entries due to overwhelming demand. Some notable trail races include: Africa *Fish River Canyon Ultra Marathon *Kalahari Augrabies Extreme Marathon *Mount Cameroon Race of Hope *Peninsula Ultra Fun Run: *Rhodes Trail Run Asia *Ultra-Trail Mount Fuji (UTMF): 161 km (since 2012) *Trans Japan Alps Race (TJAR): 415 km (since 2002) Europe * Fru≈°kogorski maraton: (since 1978) * Transvulcania: * Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc: * Tor des G√©ants: * Scenic Trail: North America *Bear 100 Mile Endurance Run: 100 miles (160 km) *Dipsea Race: the oldest trail running event in the US *Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run: *Leadville Trail 100: *Western States Endurance Run: *Barkley Marathons: Oceania * Kepler Challenge: also includes the Luxmore Grunt (New Zealand) * Kokoda Challenge Race: See also * IAU Trail World Championships * Hillwalking * Skyrunning References External links * Running by type ","title":"Trail running"},{"id":"717903","text":"Roque S√°enz Pe√±a Lahitte (March 19, 1851 ‚Äì August 9, 1914) was President of Argentina, serving from October 12, 1910, to his death in office on August 9, 1914. He was the son of former president Luis S√°enz Pe√±a. He was responsible for passing Law 8871, known as \\"S√°enz Pe√±a Law\\", which greatly reformed the Argentine electoral system, making the vote secret, universal and compulsory for males over 18. This effectively ended the rule by electoral fraud of the conservative Argentine oligarchy, and paved the way for the rise of the Radical Civic Union in the first free elections of the country. President Roque S√°enz Pe√±a Avenue in Buenos Aires is named after him. He also served in the War of the Pacific as a lieutenant colonel of the Peruvian Army, and was made prisoner by Chile for six months following the Battle of Arica. He later served as ambassador to Spain (1906‚Äì1907) and Italy (1907‚Äì1910).  Early life  Roque S√°enz Pe√±a was born on March 19, 1851, in Buenos Aires to an aristocratic family. His father was Luis S√°enz Pe√±a, the president of Argentina between 1892 and 1895. S√°enz Pe√±a inherited the opponents of his father, who was forced to resign, and traveled throughout Europe before he entered politics. He studied law during the unsuccessful 1874 revolution started by the Liberal party lead by Bartolom√© Mitre, in which S√°enz Pe√±a did not participate. After earning his law degree in 1875 and joining the National Autonomist Party (Partido Autonomista Nacional ‚ÄìPAN), he joined the militia and was under the orders of General Luis Mar√≠a Campos until 1877. In 1876 he was elected to the Buenos Aires Legislature as a member of the Autonomist Party.  War of the Pacific  The War of the Pacific (La Guerra del Pac√≠fico) pitted Chile against an allied Bolivia and Peru. Later, Argentina secretly joined the alliance. The dispute was over territory on the Pacific coast that had never been resolved, specifically control of a part of the Atacama Desert. The area contained high amounts of sodium nitrate which is a valuable mineral resource. During the war, S√°enz Pe√±a left Argentina to fight with the Peruvians. His main motivation was not patriotic or to show solidarity, but rather to escape Buenos Aires due to an unrequited love affair. After his superior officers had been killed in the Battle of Arica he assumed their roles and commanded a very weak Peruvian division. S√°enz Pe√±a was captured after the Peruvians' defeat at the battle and imprisoned briefly by the Chileans.  Rise to power  When S√°enz Pe√±a returned to Buenos Aires he was appointed sub-secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Relations under Minister of Foreign Relations Bernardo de Irigoyen in 1880. He soon left politics only to return in 1887 when he accepted the ministership to Uruguay. He represented Argentina at the 1888 Montevideo Congress. S√°enz Pe√±a held firm to his legal and political doctrines and definitively stated that Argentine was immune to any action taken by the assembly. Along with Manuel Quintana, S√°enz Pe√±a represented Argentina in the first Pan American Conference in 1889. The two delegates made a 40-day journey to New York and then a four-day trip to Washington for the meeting that was taking placed in the State Department building. The Argentine delegation boycotted the opening meeting over, as they saw it, a violation of diplomatic custom. Custom requires a delegate from an invited country to preside over the conference, but the U.S. Secretary of State was elected to be the permanent chair of the conference. The delegates attended the second session. Throughout the conference S√°enz Pe√±a advocated against an American free trade area. Nevertheless, the United States and twelve nations voted for a ‚Äúrecommendation to work for inter-American reciprocity treaties.‚Äù Only Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia voted against it. During S√°enz Pe√±a's tenure as foreign minister, he traveled the world and effectively argued for policies that benefited Argentina. He also performed traditional ceremonial duties, like in 1906 when he attended the wedding of Spanish king Alfonso XIII. He worked with the Italian government to increase trade while providing them with official cables from Argentina telling of the economic developments within the country. He distributed these cables to other European governments and businessmen as well. Before his presidency, S√°enz Pe√±a made Europeans aware of Argentina's significance internationally.  Presidency  On October 12, 1910, Roque S√°enz Pe√±a assumed the presidency of Argentina. In his first inaugural address he declared: ‚ÄúMy international policy if known to you. It will be friendship for Europe and fraternity for America.‚Äù He came into power without the support of his own party, like his father. S√°enz Pe√±a was elected while tensions were high in 1910 while promising electoral reform to curb the power of the oligarchy and to prevent a revolution. Electoral reform was debated in Congress in 1911 and then implemented in 1912 as La ley 8.871, now known as the S√°enz Pe√±a Law. The president said, \\"I have told my country my thought, my convictions, and my hopes. Let my country listen to the words and advice of its head of state, may it vote.\\" The law established compulsory and universal male suffrage for those who are over eighteen years of age. There was no discussion of whether the enfranchisement should extend to women. The law required voting in order to increase civic engagement, and in order to stop corruption the Army was deployed during elections. One third of the vote turned out before the passage of the legislation compared to 70 to 80 percent of it afterwards. Political corruption was successfully curbed. The core purpose of the law was to create a new large conservative voting bloc and force oligarchs to adapt to changing times. After the law was implemented, the newly formed opposition to the oligarchs won positions after the elections of 1912 and 1914, but Hipolito Yrigoyen‚Äôs and his Radical Party‚Äôs presidential victory in 1916 was the greatest blow to the old elite. In describing his motivation for the promulgation of the law to the Argentine legislature, S√°enz Pe√±a said, \\"I aspire, senators and representatives, for minorities to be represented and widely guaranteed in the integrity of their rights. It is indubitable that the majority should govern, but it is not less true that minorities should be heard, collaborating with their thought and with their action in the evolution of the country.\\" Death and legacy During the last days of his life, S√°enz Pe√±a remarked ‚ÄúI have lost almost all my friends, but I have governed for the Republic.‚Äù He died during his six-year term as president on August 9, 1914, due to complications related to diabetes. S√°enz Pe√±a is known today for his electoral reform and his fierce determination to protect the interests of Argentina abroad. His daughter married Carlos Saavedra Lamas, academic and politician, and the first Latin American Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

It is the only Catholic HBCU and the second Catholic university founded by a saint, after St Mary-of-the- Woods College. History Located in New Orleans, Xavier University of Louisiana was established in 1925 when Saint Katharine Drexel and the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament founded the coeducational secondary school from which it evolved. Drexel, supported by the interest of a substantial inheritance from her father, banker-financier Francis Drexel, founded and staffed many institutions throughout the United States in an effort to help educate Native Americans and African Americans. Aware of the serious lack of Catholic- oriented education available to young black people in the South, Katharine Drexel (now Saint Katharine Drexel) came to New Orleans and established a high school. The site was previously occupied by Southern University, which had moved to Baton Rouge after an influx of white neighbors petitioned for its relocation. Mother Katharine purchased the property through an agent, but once the true purpose of the transaction became known, vandals smashed all the building's windows. Xavier University Preparatory School opened on 27 September 1915 and was named after Saint Francis Xavier, Francis Drexel's patron saint. Also known as Xavier Prep, it remained in operation until 2013; today, St. Katharine Drexel Preparatory School operates from the same location on Magazine Street in New Orleans. In 1917 the school was expanded to include a normal school, as teaching was one of the few career fields open to Blacks at the time, and Archbishop James Blenk was eager for graduates to teach six new Black parishes that were planned. By 1922, the school was cited, using the name \\"Xavier University,\\" as the only Catholic institution in the United States that offered \\"a full four years' high school course to colored boys.\\" In 1925 Xavier University of Louisiana became a reality when the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences was established. The first degrees were awarded three years later. The College of Pharmacy was opened two years later in 1927. Recognizing the university's need for a separate identity and room to expand, St. Katharine bought a tract of undeveloped land for a campus on the corner of Palmetto and Pine Streets in 1929. To avoid blockage of the deal, Mother Katharine again purchased the property through an agent. Construction of the U-shaped, Gothic Revival Xavier University Main Building, Convent and Library, made from Indiana limestone and now a national landmark, were completed between 1932 and 1937. The Administration building is also a City of New Orleans landmark. In 2018, Xavier had an endowment of approximately $171 million, which is the fourth highest among Louisiana's colleges and universities.USNews rankings. Retrieved December 24, 2017. In 2020, Xavier received $20 million from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, the largest single gift in the university's history.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/three-hbcus- announce-they-received-the-largest-donations-in-the-schools-histories/ Campus construction Through the years, as needs dictated, the campus gradually expanded: *Administration Building (1933) *Old Library, now music department (1937) *Gymnasium (1937) *Saint Michael's Hall men's dorm (1955) *Old Student Center (1962) *Saint Joseph's Hall women's dorm (1965) *House of Studies (1967) *Saint Katharine Drexel Hall women's dorm (1969) *College of Pharmacy (1970) *Norman C.

These include the Library/Resource center, the Norman C. Francis science addition, the University Center, the Living Learning Center, the Saint Martin De Porres hall and the Katharine Drexel hall. The Blessed Sacrament Sisters remain a vital presence on campus, providing much-needed staffing and some financial assistance, but today Xavier is governed by a multicultural Board of Trustees. In 1987, Pope John Paul II addressed the presidents of all U.S. Catholic colleges from the courtyard of the Xavier administration building. Norman C. Francis retired in 2015, after 47 years as president of the university. United States civil rights movement In May 1961, the civil rights activist group known as the Freedom Riders arrived in New Orleans by plane after bus drivers in Alabama refused to take them to Montgomery, Alabama. Locals, aware of the fire bombings and other attacks that had befallen the group, refused to accommodate them with lodging out of fear of retaliatory violence. Xavier President Emeritus Norman C. Francis, at the time the university's Dean of Men, secretly arranged for the group to stay several days in a dormitory on campus. Francis received permission from University President Sister Mary Josephina to allow the group to occupy space on the third floor of St. Michael's Hall under the condition that the press would not be alerted as to the move. Historic St. Michael's Hall, on Pine Street on Xavier's campus, still accommodates male students in traditional dormitory style. Hurricane Katrina Hurricane Katrina made landfall in August 2005, striking the New Orleans area. Xavier, located in the lower-lying Gert Town section and adjacent to the Washington-Palmetto Canal, suffered damage to almost every structure on campus. Many buildings sat partially submerged for extended periods of time following the hurricane. Dr. Norman C. Francis, President of the University, organized boats and buses to transport stranded faculty, staff, and students from the campus to safe areas. Students began returning to the university in January 2006.

The groundbreaking ceremony in 2008 was attended by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, leader of Qatar, and on 15 October 2010 the school's Qatar Pharmacy Pavilion opened, adding adjacent to the existing College of Pharmacy building. President Barack Obama visited New Orleans in August 2010 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. He gave his address from Xavier, complimenting the work of the leaders of the community and affirming the commitment to continue to aid in the re-building of the area. In 2006, the university had bestowed an Honorary Degree on then-Senator Obama. Xavier University received the \\"Katrina Compassion Award\\" from the US government Corporation for National and Community Service in 2006, for the combined efforts of an estimated 60% of its students in rebuilding the neighborhoods damaged by the hurricane. Student demographics Xavier is Catholic and historically black. However, its doors have always been open to qualified students of every race and creed. Today 25.1 percent of its students are not African-American and 74.3 percent are not Catholic. More than half (58.2%) of Xavier students are from Louisiana ‚Äì primarily from the New Orleans area. Non-local enrollment continues to increase with students coming from at least 40 other states ‚Äì most notably Texas (7.5%) and Georgia (4.9%). Five foreign countries are represented on campus. Student life is enriched by the social and cultural setting of New Orleans and by campus activities designed to enhance personal growth, interpersonal skills, and leadership in such areas as community service, the environment, cultural concerns, and social justice. Administration University President President Verret Dr. C. Reynold Verret is Xavier University of Louisiana's sixth president. He assumed his position as the university's leader during the Summer of 2015 and was officially inaugurated in the university's Academic Convocation Center on 26 February 2016. Dr. Norman C. Francis President Emeritus At the time of his retirement, President Emeritus Dr. Norman C. Francis was the longest serving president of a university in the United States. Himself a Xavier graduate, he led the university for 47 years (1968-2015) and became a nationally recognized leader in higher education. Among other honors and roles entrusted to him, he served as the head of several national educational groups and in 2006 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

New York Times Retrieved September 10, 2015. Xavier's College of Pharmacy is one of just two pharmacy schools in Louisiana.University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM) also offers the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree, but, unlike Xavier, ULM is under public control and in the northern part of Louisiana. Xavier consistently ranks among the top three colleges in the nation in graduating African Americans with Pharm.D. degrees. Dual degree engineering program Xavier does not offer engineering degrees but belongs to partnerships with several engineering institutions that automatically admit qualified Xavier science students interested in pursuing a bachelor's in an engineering discipline. Students who successfully complete the program will receive a bachelor's degree from Xavier and the chosen engineering institution in approximately five years. Engineering institutions in partnership with Xavier are Tulane University, University of New Orleans, Southern University at Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University, University of Notre Dame, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, University of Detroit Mercy, Georgia Institute of Technology, and University of Wisconsin at Madison. Campus life Athletics Xavier's athletics teams are nicknamed Gold Rush for men's teams and Gold Nuggets for women's teams.

In 1953, it became the home of evangelist Father Divine, and the center of his International Peace Mission movement. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998 for its well- preserved Chateau-style architecture, and for its association with Father Divine. and Alan Wood, Jr. Woodmont in 1902. Woodmont was designed in 1891 by Quaker architect William Lightfoot Price in the French Gothic style for Alan Wood, Jr., a steel magnate and former U.S. Congressman. Overlooking the Schuylkill River, the industrial town of Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, and the Alan Wood Iron & Steel Company Plant, the chateauesque mansion was completed in 1894 at a cost of one-million dollars. The site features views of 15 to 20 miles. The Schuylkill Expressway passes by the estate, hundreds of feet below. The model for Woodmont was the George W. Vanderbilt mansion, Biltmore, in Asheville, North Carolina. Price had designed a nearby hotel for Vanderbilt, the Kenilworth Inn (1890‚Äì91), and was intimately familiar with the then-under-construction chateau. Woodmont includes tennis courts, a swimming pool, stables, several outbuildings, greenhouses, a stream, and walking paths. The original property spanned more than , including a working farm with two dairy barns (one survives). Alan Wood, Jr. occupied the estate for less than a decade. A year before his 1902 death, he sold it to his nephew, Richard G. Wood, who lived there for 28 years. Richard began subdividing the land in 1929, including the sale of to the Philadelphia Country Club. A description from 1897: > WOODMONT.--Alan Wood, Jr., owns the estate with the above name.

Jacobs & Co., 1897), pp. 206, 209. Father Divine The estate is today the center of the International Peace Mission movement. Father Divine, a self-proclaimed God and leader of the movement, was given the estate by a follower, John Devoute, in 1953. His followers renovated the mansion and placed an American flag prominently in front reflecting Father Divine's patriotism. They also added a garden like those on previous Peace Mission properties. An open house was held on September 10‚Äì12, 1953. Followers visited Father Divine here until his death in 1965. All furnishings in Divine's rooms, including an antiquated television set, have been left as they were at his death. The estate is now a shrine to his life and a meeting place for his few remaining followers. \\"Peace\\" Metalwork on a Spire Visiting Woodmont is open to the public on Sunday afternoons, from April to October.

Early life and education Bogoljub was born to Janiƒáije Kariƒá and Danica Kuzmanoviƒá. He earned a degree in Geography at the University of Pristina and his Master's Degree in economy at University of Ni≈°. He married Milanka Babiƒá and has four children Neboj≈°a, Nade≈æda, Jelena and Danica. Career The Kariƒá family have owned manufacturing business in Eastern Europe since the 1960s. The population knows him simply as a mechanic from Kosovo without a degree. He opened a workshop, starting with small operations of under ten employees. From this, Kariƒá grew his business empire into multibillion-dollar corporation, now known as the Astra Group. The Astra (BK) Group is composed of the following industry sectors: * manufacturing, civil engineering and constructing * International wholesales export-import trading * Telecommunications and electronic media (GSM and NMT mobile telephony, internet services, alphanumeric paging, BK Telecom TV station) * Banking and finance * Media which includes television, radio, magazines, newspapers and online * Science and education Kariƒá is the founder and owner of BK University. * Charitable activities The BK Foundation funds humanitarian aid in Yugoslavia and other countries. It is focused on helping children, refugees and provides scholarships for disadvantaged and talented students. The activities of the Foundation are also centred on the promotion of cultural values. In 1987 he established first private construction company in Moscow (ex USSR) which is nowadays one of the largest construction companies in Europe. In 2002, Kariƒá created the Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Yugoslavia, the first true association of private businessmen in Yugoslavia set up since World War II. In 2006 he established another construction company named DANA HOLDINGS. Dana Holdings is a leading, fully integrated real estate, investment and development company of residential, industrial, commercial, educational and mixed-use projects as well as PPP investments in emerging markets. The company has successfully completed construction projects totaling millions of square meters for the Russian government, Moscow City Government, the Government of Yakutia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. Law problems From 2006 up to 2016 he was also under investigation for money laundering and suspected for damaging the budget of the Republic of Serbia by 21.980.551,98 US Dollars at which time he moved to Russia. A warrant for his arrest was issued by the Serbian government and Interpol at the same time. In 2016 the investigation was dropped after the statute of limitations expired and the charges were no longer valid. As a free man he returned to Serbia on December 30, 2016 and has since resumed his usual activities.  Education and science work  He completed primary and high school in Pec, he graduated from the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Pristina, with the major in geography. He obtained his MA diploma from Faculty of Economics in Nis with thesis in Organization and development of medium-sized enterprises. Kariƒá wrote several research papers published in country and abroad. Many of these lectures are published in various magazines he owned. He is author of many books which focus on private business, finance, and financial management which were written by bachelor and master students at his own universities. Political and social activities Kariƒá ran for President of Serbia in the June 2004 Presidential Election, polling nearly 20% of the vote. His message was on the supremacy of economy over politics, the need to fundamentally transform Serbian society into a modern European democracy and revitalise its economy. Kariƒá subsequently formed and registered his political party Strength of Serbia Movement (SSM) which participated in the local elections of September 2004. At these elections, the SSM, although formed barely a month before the elections, had a surprisingly good showing, established itself firmly in the center of the democratic bloc of political forces in Serbia. Its representatives, in coalition with other democratic forces were part of many municipal councils (including that of the capital Belgrade), and it had several deputies and ministers in the Provincial Government of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. As a new law on political parties became valid, Strength of Serbia Movement re-registered itself again in 2010 under the name Strength of Serbia Movement - BK. At that moment, SSM was in coalition with Tomislav Nikolic's party, forming an opposition bloc for the next elections.

A safety curtain (or fire curtain in America) is a fire safety precaution used in large proscenium theatres. It is usually a heavy fibreglass or iron curtain located immediately behind the proscenium arch. Asbestos-based materials were originally used to manufacture the curtain, before the dangers of asbestos were widely known. The safety curtain is sometimes referred to as an iron in British theatres, regardless of the actual construction material. Occupational safety and health regulations state that the safety curtain must be able to resist fire and thereby prevent (or at least hinder) fires starting on stage from spreading to the auditorium and the rest of the theatre, reducing injuries to audience members and members of staff. The curtain is extremely heavy and therefore requires its own dedicated operating mechanisms. In an emergency, the stage manager can usually pull a lever backstage which will cause the curtain to fall rapidly into position. Alternatively, heat-sensitive components can be built into the rigging to automatically close this curtain in case of fire. Finally, it may be released electronically by a building's fire control system if any alarm box is operated. It can also be flown in and out, as regulations in some jurisdictions state that it must be shown to the audience, to prove its effective operation, for a certain amount of time during every performance. This usually occurs during the intermission. In smaller theatres, a safety curtain is not usually required. Specifically, most United States building codes only require a fire curtain in theatres with a stage height of more than .2006 International Building Code, 410.3.4, p. 51 The heavy, flame-retardant house tabs can provide some degree of fire separation. In the UK, it is a requirement that a safety curtain must be fully down within the proscenium opening within 30 seconds of being released. In 1794 the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane became the first theatre to feature an iron safety curtain. Several other serious fires, notably that at the Theatre Royal, Exeter in 1887, led to the introduction of safety curtains on a wider scale. A very early example of a safety curtain installation in the United States was at the New Fifth Avenue Theatre (New York City) which opened in 1873. Chicago's 1903 Iroquois Theatre fire resulted in over 600 deaths when the theater's safety curtain got stuck midway down, along with other structural deficiencies in the building. Related stage fire safety devices The safety curtain can be combined with other safety devices, such as: *Smoke pockets - are steel channels located at either side of the proscenium arch that the safety curtain travels within to create a physical barrier between the auditorium and the stage. The safety curtain is not intended to create an air seal but rather prevent material from falling from the stage house into the audience. *Fire doors - heavy, fireproof doors that are designed to automatically close any doorway onto the stage in the event of a fire. These doors are usually on a slightly pitched track, and are rigged in a way that causes them to automatically close when heated to a certain temperature. *Smoke doors or stage lantern - vents above the stage which, when opened in case of fire, will draw smoke out of the auditorium and up out of the roof of the theatre, enabling safer evacuation of the audience. The vents are often attached to compressed springs, so that when activated, they will stay open. *Drencher or deluge system - a large reservoir of water stored above the stage which, when released in case of fire, will flood the stage in an attempt to extinguish any flames. This type of system can be problematic, as water interacting with onstage electrical circuits can cause fire. *Water curtain- a system similar to the deluge system, except instead of having the water drench the stage itself, the water flows from sprinkler heads or other nozzles directly in front of the proscenium to prevent sparks from flying off the stage or to extinguish any burning material (such as a set) which may fall through the proscenium. In the event of a fire, the use of smoke doors and fire curtains means that the stage area effectively functions as a chimney. The heated air rises and leaves through the smoke doors, and this puts the building into negative pressure, which in turn draws fresh air in through any open exit doors. Patrons waiting to exit will have fresh breathing air until the exit doors close. The exit doors which open out will be drawn closed tightly by this draft once they are no longer held open by evacuees. Once the doors are closed, the fire loses its oxygen source. If the doors are then opened again, a backdraft can occur.

Education and career He graduated from the University of Belgrade's Law School, where he eventually obtained doctorate. In 2001, Batiƒá announced that warrants would be issued for the arrests of persons removed from power during the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in October 2000 and who were suspected of misconduct through abuse of power.

Abstract. This is roughly equal to intermediate consumption. Finer distinctions include raw materials, intermediate goods, inventories, ancillary operating expenses and (working capital). It is contrasted with fixed capital. The term was used in more specialized ways by classical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx. Where the distinction is used, circulating capital is a component of (total) capital, also including fixed capital used in a single cycle of production. In contrast to fixed capital, it is used up in every cycle (raw materials, basic and intermediate materials, combustible, energy‚Ä¶). In accounting, the circulating capital comes under the heading of current assets. Building on the work of Quesnay and Turgot, Adam Smith (1776) made the first explicit distinction between fixed and circulating capital. In his usage, circulating capital includes wages and labour maintenance, money, and inputs from land, mines, and fisheries associated with production.Adam Smith, 1776. Wealth of Nations, Books II, ch. 1, 2, and 5. According to Karl Marx (second volume of Das Kapital, end of chapter 7) the turnover of capital influences \\"the processes of production and self-expansion\\", the two new forms of capital, circulating and fixed, \\"accrue to capital from the process of circulation and affect the form of its turnover\\". In the following chapter Marx defines fixed capital and circulating capital. In chapter 9 he claims: \\"We have here not alone quantitative but also qualitative difference.\\" Conventionally, (physical) capital assets held by a business for more than one year are regarded in annual accounting statements as \\"fixed\\", the rest as \\"circulating\\". In modern economies such as the United States, roughly half of the intermediate inputs bought or used by businesses are in fact services, and not goods.

Reuptake inhibition is achieved when extracellular dopamine not absorbed by the postsynaptic neuron is blocked from re-entering the presynaptic neuron. This results in increased extracellular concentrations of dopamine and increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission. DRIs are used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy for their psychostimulant effects, and in the treatment of obesity and binge eating disorder for their appetite suppressant effects. They are sometimes used as antidepressants in the treatment of mood disorders, but their use as antidepressants is limited given that strong DRIs have a high abuse potential and legal restrictions on their use. Lack of dopamine reuptake and the increase in extracellular levels of dopamine have been linked to increased susceptibility to addictive behavior given increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission. The dopaminergic pathways are considered to be strong reward centers. Many DRIs such as cocaine are drugs of abuse due to the rewarding effects evoked by elevated synaptic concentrations of dopamine in the brain. Society and culture History of use Until the 1950s, dopamine was thought to only contribute to the biosynthesis of norepinephrine and epinephrine. It was not until dopamine was found in the brain in similar levels as norepinephrine that the possibility was considered that its biological role might be other than the synthesis of the catecholamines. Pharmacotherapeutic uses The following drugs have DRI action and have been or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, which may or may not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (due to Yerkes‚ÄìDodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change).. Page 928 (4th of article) 1st paragraph. Lines 8‚Äî11. Mirror hotlink. Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane. The wakefulness-promoting agent modafinil and its analogues (e.g., adrafinil, armodafinil) have been approved to treat narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder. These act as weak (micromolar) DRIs, but this effect does not correlate with wakefulness-promoting effects, suggesting the effect is too weak to be of clinical significance. The conclusion is these drugs promote wakefulness via some other mechanism. DRIs have been explored as potential antiaddictive agents because of their ability to replace the reward effects received from other drugs. DRIs have been successfully used to serve as nicotine replacement in cases of smoking addiction and methadone replacement in the case of heroin addiction. DRIs have been explored as treatment for cocaine addiction, and have shown to alleviate cravings and self-administration. Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, including DRIs, have also shown effectiveness as therapy for excessive food intake and appetite control for obese patients. Most drugs marketed for this purpose have been withdrawn or discontinued because of adverse side effects such as increase in blood pressure, as well as high abuse potential. List of DRIs 3D structure of RTI-470, a high-affinity and selective DAT ligand Only DRIs which are selective for the DAT over the other monoamine transporters (MATs) are listed below.

Founded in the English West Midlands around Birmingham in 1775 as a partnership between the English manufacturer Matthew Boulton and the Scottish engineer James Watt, the firm had a major role in the Industrial Revolution and grew to be a major producer of steam engines in the 19th century. The engine partnership A38(M) in Birmingham, UK. It was built in 1817 and used in Netherton at the ironworks of M W Grazebrook. (Location: ) The partnership was formed in 1775 to exploit Watt's patent for a steam engine with a separate condenser. This made much more efficient use of its fuel than the older Newcomen engine. Initially the business was based at the Soho Manufactory near Boulton's Soho House on the southern edge of the then-rural parish of Handsworth. However most of the components for their engines were made by others, for example the cylinders by John Wilkinson. In 1795, they began to make steam engines themselves at their Soho Foundry in Smethwick, near Birmingham, England. The partnership was passed to two of their sons in 1800. William Murdoch was made a partner of the firm in 1810, where he remained until his retirement 20 years later at the age of 76. The firm lasted over 120 years, albeit renamed \\"James Watt & Co.\\" in 1849, and was still making steam engines in 1895, when it was sold to W & T Avery Ltd.. Nurturing talent The business was a hotbed for the nurturing of emerging engineering talent. Among the names which were employed there in the eighteenth century were James Law, Peter Ewart, William Brunton, Isaac Perrins, William Murdoch, and John Southern. Archive Scientific apparatus designed by Boulton and Watt in preparation of the Pneumatic Institution in Bristol The firm left an extremely detailed archive of its activities, which was given to the city of Birmingham in 1911 and is kept at the Library of Birmingham. The library has since obtained various other related archives. An additional archive was donated to the Boulton and Watt collection in 2015. It represents the significant research carried out by Dr John Richardson (Accession number 2015/049) The archive includes: A copy of his completed P.h.D.thesis submitted to the University of Reading in 1989. The original thesis remains the property of the University of Reading. The archive contains: Display folders containing text and different varieties of drawings from the detailed examination of the large number of portfolios of engineering drawings. these include drawings used in the development of new ideas, detail drawings of parts, assembly drawings, drawings used in instruction and function and 'prestige' drawings often produced in full colour to provide customers with realistic views of assemblies and finished engines. Folders containing detailed handwritten notes on all portfolios examined. This information includes portfolio number, dates of drawings and comments on techniques used. Where applicable, the records cross reference with letters, books and other related literature on the firm of Boulton and Watt. A selection of DVDs containing all text and the many drawings studied are also included in the archive. The research is primarily concerned with the contribution of the firm of Boulton and Watt to engineering drawing used in design and manufacture. The archive also includes work carried out by other early architects, artists, engineers and designers. The archive also includes information on a project undertaken in 1984. The Australian Project An opportunity arose in 1984 to evaluate the use of Boulton & Watt drawings made two hundred years earlier when Dr Richardson was asked to help the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, New South Wales Australia who were planning to restore and erect a Boulton and Watt engine. In the course of restoration the engine had been completely dismantled and the work revealed that the cylinder, valve gear, condenser and air pump had all been modified at least once from the original design. Reports from Australia confirmed that the engine was erected in the Power House Museum, Ultimo, New South Wales. This engine was originally designed and built for Samuel Whitbread in 1784 and the job portfolio (B & W 4) contains forty four drawings that relate to it. Copies of the different types of drawings were made and sent out; they provided all the necessary information required to re assemble and erect the engine.

Rituals would have been performed at key times of the year, such as the Spring Equinox and Summer Solstice, to ensure a successful harvest from the land. His approach led him to question what he saw as the over-romanticised view that Stonehenge was built from bluestones hauled by hand from the Preseli Hills in south west Wales to Salisbury Plain. In his view, the stones had been left close to the site by earlier glaciers and then exploited by the monument's builders Burl, Aubrey. The Stone Circles of the British Isles. Others have argued that the bluestones have been traced to only the Preseli Hills through their chemical signature and that they could not have come from elsewhere. Additionally, it has been claimed that there was no known glacier with a course linking the hills with Salisbury Plain or a glacier from anywhere that reached far enough south. On the other hand, research by earth scientists shows that glacier ice reached the Scilly Isles on at least one occasion, and that ice which passed through Pembrokeshire did cross the coasts of Somerset and Devon.Burl, Aubrey. 2001. \\"Stonehenge: how did the stones get there? - Aubrey Burl Explains How the Myth of the Stones Transported from South Wales to Salisbury Plain Arose, and Why It Is Wrong\\".

In 1960, the Saab 93f was being replaced by the Saab 96 and a new 841 cc engine was developed. The competition and testing departments of Saab did not want to see any series produced sports engines with the new size until they had a chance to try some new ideas. These ideas led to the creation of these Formula Junior race cars with which Saab surprised the motor racing world in the late autumn of 1960. The cars first showed up at the Geller√•sen racetrack at Karlskoga and then at the El√§intarhanajot race in Helsinki (Finland), in 1961, finishing 4th and 5th. The body design was unusual. Instead of using a multi-tubular spaceframe chassis like other Formula Junior cars, Saab chose to construct an advanced aluminium monocoque car, with a plastic nose-cone. The fibreglass nose protected a 'bored-out' horizontal 950 cc three cylinder two stroke engine, with two dual Solex carburettors developing some 95 bhp - (one of the carburettors was cut in half, thus providing three chokes ‚Äî one for each of the three cylinders). There was a cross-flow radiator, for cooling. The suspension was purpose-built, incorporating a unique type of tensile spring. The cars did not do very well in races, due to their cornering ability and their relatively low-powered engine (the later regulations allowed up to 1100 cc engines). Nonetheless, two first places and a track record (Stockholm) were achieved. The 70%-30% front-rear weight distribution created pronounced understeer. This was only partially overcome by designing the rear suspension to encourage the inside rear wheel to lift during cornering. Only two cars were built, as later regulations made them even less competitive. They were retired at the end of the 1961 racing season. History records them as having fulfilled an important developmental role for Saab's competition department. The cars appeared in typical Swedish livery of blue and yellow. The drivers were G√∂sta Karlsson, Carl-Magnus Skogh and Erik Carlsson. Sources * The Saab Way by Gunnar A. Sj√∂gren.

She served in the United States House of Representatives. She was the first woman elected to Congress from Ohio.Rep. Frances P. Bolton dies, March 9, 1977 - Andrew Glass - POLITICO.com In the late 1930s Bolton took an isolationist position on foreign policy, opposing the Selective Service Act (the draft) in 1940, and opposing Lend-Lease in 1941. During the war she called for desegregation of the military nursing units, which were all-white and all-female. In 1947 she sponsored a long-range bill for nursing education, but it did not pass. When the draft was resumed after the war, Bolton strongly advocated the conscription of women. Pointing to their prominent role during the war, she said it was vitally important that women continue to play these essential roles. She saw no threat to marriage, and argued that women in military service would develop their character and skills, thus enhancing their role in the family. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bolton strongly supported the United Nations, especially UNICEF, and strongly supported the independence of African colonies.Eleonora W. Schoenebaum, ed. Political Profiles: The Truman Years (1978) pp 43-44 Early life She was born on March 29, 1885, in Cleveland, Ohio as Frances Payne Bingham. She was the daughter of Charles William Bingham (1846‚Äì1929) and Mary Perry (n√©e Payne) Bingham (1854‚Äì1898). Her siblings included Oliver Perry Bingham, William H. Bingham, Elizabeth Beardsley (n√©e Bingham) Blossom, and Henry Payne Bingham. Among her maternal family members was uncle Nathan P. Payne (the former mayor of Cleveland), Oliver Hazard Payne (who worked for Standard Oil), and aunt Flora Payne (the wife of U.S. Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney). Her maternal grandfather was wealthy U.S. Senator, Henry B. Payne. Frances was educated at private schools in Cleveland, New York City, and in Paris. Career Active in public health, nursing education and other social service, education, and philanthropic work, she succeeded her husband, Chester C. Bolton, in office a few months after his death in 1939. Upon election to the remainder of her late husband's term, Bolton refused the customary widow's allowance comprising the remainder of the salary her late husband would have collected had he served out his term. She represented the 22nd District, mostly consisting of Cleveland's eastern suburbs. Bolton served an additional fourteen terms, serving alongside her son, Oliver P. Bolton, for three of those terms. She and Oliver appeared on What's My Line? as the only mother and son serving together. It was reported that when he voted against her, she once stage-whispered, \\"That's my adopted son.\\"Visitors and Friends: Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University A confidential 1943 analysis of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office described Bolton as Serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bolton called Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in May 1954 after the fall of the French base at Dien Bien Phu, urging him to invite nurse Genevieve de Galard to the United States. When Galard arrived in July, Bolton described her as a \\"symbol of heroic femininity in the free world\\".Morgan, T. Valley of Death: The Tragedy at Dien Bien Phu That Led America into the Vietnam War. New York: Random House, 2010. p 629. After receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Galard was received at a dinner for three hundred in Congresswoman Bolton's home district of Cleveland while on a tour of the country. Bolton voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. House Foreign Affairs Committee In 1955, she became the first American woman member of Congress to head an international delegation, using her own resources to fund it. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee on Africa, she felt it was her responsibility to visit as much of Africa as possible. Arriving in Senegal on September 1, she spent the next six weeks crisscrossing the continent by plane, train, boat, and car. Her important stops included Liberia, Ghana (then still known as the Gold Coast), the Belgian Congo, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa, and Ethiopia. She met with leading nationalists such as Kwame Nkrumah, powerful politicians such as Haile Selassie, and leading women such as the Queen Mother of the Tutsis. She also spent a lot of time during her trip visiting schools and talking with young people, and meeting with women from all walks of life in the markets or clinics. As someone with a lifelong interest in education and health care, she prioritized these issues during her African travels. When she got back to the United States she submitted a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should create a new State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new assistant secretary of state for African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958.Andrew DeRoche, \\"Frances Bolton and Africa, 1955-58,\\" Passport: The Newsletter of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations (January 2010), 34-37. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.Andrew DeRoche, \\"Frances Bolton, Margaret Tibbetts and the US Relations with the Rhodesian Federation, 1950-1960,\\" in Jan-Bart Gewald, editor, Living the End of Empire: Politics and Society in Late Colonial Zambia (Leiden: Brill, 2011), 299-325. In addition to influencing US relations with Africa, another of Bolton's most lasting achievements was sponsoring legislation to purchase property across the Potomac River from Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington.About  Our land serves as an outdoor classroom for our educational programs, research, agricultural and conservation projects This prevented commercialization of the area and preserved its appearance as it was when Washington lived there. Bolton had a phenomenal relationship with her constituents of Italian-American heritage and was known for mailing government child-care pamphlets to homes where new children were born. The nursing school at Case Western Reserve University is named in her honor for her accomplishments and generosity in the field of public nursing.Frances Payne Bolton Later life After rising to become ranking minority member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bolton was defeated in a bid for a sixteenth term in 1968 by Charles Vanik. She was, until Louise Slaughter's continued service in 2012, the oldest woman to serve in the House of Representatives. Bolton retired to her family home, Franchester (named for herself and her late husband), in Lyndhurst, Ohio. Personal life In 1907, Frances was married to Chester Castle Bolton (1882‚Äì1939).

It was described by the Urban Land Institute in 2009 as \\"the model for post-industrial waterfront redevelopment around the world\\".\\"Announcement of 2009 ULI Awards for Excellence.\\" Urban Land Institute, Atlanta, April 24, 2009. The Inner Harbor is located at the mouth of Jones Falls, creating the wide and short northwest branch of the Patapsco River. The district includes any water west of a line drawn between the foot of President Street and the American Visionary Art Museum. The name \\"Inner Harbor\\" is used not just for the water but for the surrounding area of the city, with approximate street boundaries of President Street to the east, Lombard Street to the north, Greene Street to the west, and Key Highway on the south. The harbor is within walking distance of Camden Yards and M&T; Bank Stadium. A water taxi connects passengers to Fells Point, Canton, and Fort McHenry. History Federal Hill in 1849 with the Washington Monument in the background While Baltimore has been a major U.S. seaport since the 18th century, the historically shallow water of the Inner Harbor (prior to manipulation through dredging) was not conducive to large ships or heavy industry. These were concentrated in Locust Point, Fell's Point, and Canton. In the mid-20th century, Baltimore suffered from the economic decline of restructuring common to many industrial cities in the United States. Old harbors were abandoned with the arrival of container ships after World War II. Later, the old harbors were adapted as focal points to reconnect cities with their waterfronts, and develop public spaces, tourism, business, and housing.Ann Breen and Dick Rigby, \\"Waterfronts: Cities Reclaim Their Edge,\\" The Waterfront Center, McGraw-Hill, 1994, pp. 20‚Äì23. The Inner Harbor neighborhood is centered on a tourism-friendly plaza that surrounds part of the harbor. During the 1940s, John H. Threadgill, the head of the Steamship Trade Association, initiated a study for a cross-harbor bridge. A bridge across the Inner Harbor of Baltimore was one idea that was discussed frequently. In his capacity as head of the association, Threadgill ultimately recommended that the idea for a cross-harbor bridge be abandoned, due to the fact that Baltimore relied heavily on a shipping trade and fears that the bridge would negatively impede the flow of shipping traffic at the Port of Baltimore.Report to Honorable Theodore R. McKeldin on the proposed Cross harbor bridge. 1944. Baltimore, Md.: Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore. Threadgill was named head of Baltimore's Port Commission during the 1950s. In the 1950s, economic changes ended both the freight and passenger use of the Inner Harbor, such as the Old Bay Line's steamers. Rotting warehouses and piers were eventually torn down and replaced by open, grass-covered parkland that was used for recreational purposes and occasional large events. The waterfront was gradually transformed with award-winning parks and plazas surrounded by office buildings, hotels and leisure attractions, which reversed the city's decline and became a model for urban renaissance in cities around the world.Jenni Hewett, \\"Here's a Man-Made Waterfront Aristotle would have liked,\\" Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, October 27, 1983, p. 12. The renewal of Baltimore's Inner Harbor area began with the adoption of the Charles Center project by the City Council and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro in March 1958. Between 1958 and 1965, Baltimore renewed the center of its business district by rebuilding Charles Center with office buildings, hotels, and retail shops. At the beginning of mayor Theodore R. McKeldin's second term in 1963, the redevelopment program was expanded to include surrounding the Inner Harbor. Corporate headquarters and hotels were built around the shoreline of the Inner Harbor. A public park and promenade were added for leisure activity and community gatherings. On July 4, 1976, following the rendezvous of Tall Ships in New York for the U.S. Bicentennial, eight ships from other nations visited Baltimore, where they attracted a huge number of tourists. This interest helped spur the development of other tourist attractions ‚Äì including the National Aquarium, Maryland Science Center, and the Harborplace festival marketplace (operated by The Rouse Company), which opened on July 4, 1980.Martin L. Millspaugh, \\"Critical Mass,\\" Evening Sun, Baltimore, July 1, 1980, p. A11. The nearby Baltimore Convention Center and Hyatt Regency Baltimore Hotel added to the services and resulted in population density and visitors. With the success of the Inner Harbor in the 1970s and 1980s, Baltimore became a worldwide tourist destination and model of urban planning and development. It influenced more than 100 other cities and won more than 40 national or international awards, including a citation by the American Institute of Architects in 1984 as \\"one of the supreme achievements of large-scale urban design and development in U.S. history\\".American Institute of Architects, press release, Washington, D.C., Feb 5, 1984. In recent years, the area along the waterfront to the east of the Inner Harbor (in the direction of Fells Point and Little Italy) has been developed with condominiums, retail space, restaurants, and hotels ‚Äì an ongoing project known as Harbor East. While little development land remains around the Inner Harbor, the available land has been subject to many plans, which have not been realized. Recently completed projects include mixed-use developments incorporating office space, street-level retail, and condominiums, as well as hotel projects such as the Ritz Carlton Residences, a condominium project on Key Highway at the southeast corner of the Inner Harbor. In September 2003, the Inner Harbor area was flooded by Hurricane Isabel. The Baltimore World Trade Center remained closed for a month, but all the other buildings were saved from flooding by the Inner Harbor development controls, which were created by the master developer team of Charles Center-Inner Harbor Management, Inc. In March 2004, a water taxi capsized during a storm on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River near Fort McHenry. While occurring over a mile downstream of the Inner Harbor, the accident was associated with the Inner Harbor by news reports and casual observers. Five passengers died in the accident, which the National Transportation Safety Board determined was caused when the small pontoon-style vessel encountered unpredictable strong winds and waves.

As a central and busy part of Baltimore, the Inner Harbor has been the site of much political and artistic activity. The city is involved in ongoing disputes over free speech in the area. One early conflict concerned marchers for gay rights, whose permit was revoked by the city. (The city announced that only five or fewer people could march, and that they could not carry signs.) The Rouse Company, which began operating Harborplace in 1980, has long been in conflict with street performers. The company regulates performances, and has often been accused of suppressing free speech. These disputes came to a head in 2002‚Äì2003, when two events triggered a lawsuit against the city. ACLU lawsuit On October 21, 2002, street performer Jerry Rowan was banned from the area for making an \\"insensitive\\" joke. Discussing the then-current D.C. sniper case, Rowan said: \\"I was driving downtown this morning, and on the radio I heard that they've finally come out with a composite of the sniper, so there should be an arrest forthcoming. Apparently, he's a white guy that speaks Spanish and looks like he's Arab.\\" Police officers overheard the joke and reported it to Rouse. The company had previously sent a letter to Rowan admonishing him for \\"off-color humor\\", as well as \\"lack of respect for program administrators\\". After this report, the company banned him from the area. On April 4, 2003, a police officer asked Baltimore's Women in Black to disband. The group had (and has) gathered in McKeldin Square every Friday since September 11, 2002. Rowan and the Women in Black filed suit against the city of Baltimore on October 7, 2003, arguing their right of free speech. They were assisted by attorney Rajeev Goyle on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. The lawsuit remains unresolved as of July 2012. Negotiations among the ACLU, the city, The Rouse Company, and The Waterfront Partnership have yielded some specific results. McKeldin Square has been designated as an official free-speech zone. Elsewhere, police enforce rules against protest. On May 21, 2011, teacher Bruce Friedrich was threatened with arrest while handing out animal rights pamphlets. On September 18, 2011, police arrested artist Mark Chase for selling his paintings \\"in or near\\" the Inner Harbor amphitheater. \\"Your constitutional rights have nothing to do with the law,\\" said the arresting officer when Chase objected on First Amendment grounds.

A professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, he is editor emeritus of Dissent, an intellectual magazine that he has been affiliated with since his years as an undergraduate at Brandeis University. He has written books and essays on a wide range of topics‚Äîmany in political ethics‚Äîincluding just and unjust wars, nationalism, ethnicity, Zionism, economic justice, social criticism, radicalism, tolerance, and political obligation. He is also a contributing editor to The New Republic. To date, he has written 27 books and published over 300 articles, essays, and book reviews in Dissent, The New Republic, The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, The New York Times, Harpers, and many philosophical and political science journals. Early life and education Born to a Jewish family on March 3, 1935, Walzer graduated summa cum laude from Brandeis University in 1956 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. He then studied at the University of Cambridge on a Fulbright Fellowship (1956‚Äì1957) and completed his doctoral work at Harvard University, earning his Doctor of Philosophy degree in government under Samuel Beer in 1961. Work Michael Walzer is usually identified as one of the leading proponents of the communitarian position in political theory, along with Alasdair MacIntyre and Michael J. Sandel. Like Sandel and MacIntyre, Walzer is not completely comfortable with this label.Communitarianism > Notes (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) However, he has long argued that political theory must be grounded in the traditions and culture of particular societies, and has long opposed what he sees to be the excessive abstraction of political philosophy. His most important intellectual contributions include Just and Unjust Wars (1977), a revitalization of just war theory that insists on the importance of \\"ethics\\" in wartime while eschewing pacifism; the theory of \\"complex equality\\", which holds that the metric of just equality is not some single material or moral good, but rather that egalitarian justice demands that each good be distributed according to its social meaning, and that no good (like money or political power) be allowed to dominate or distort the distribution of goods in other spheres;Spheres of Justice (1983); see criticism, Young Kim, Justice as Right Actions: An Original Theory of Justice in Conversation with Major Contemporary Accounts (Lexington Books, 2015), ch. 11 () and an argument that justice is primarily a moral standard within particular nations and societies, not one that can be developed in a universalized abstraction. In On Toleration, he describes various examples of (and approaches to) toleration in various settings, including multinational empires such as Rome; nations in past and current-day international society; \\"consociations\\" such as Switzerland; nation-states such as France; and immigrant societies such as the United States. He concludes by describing a \\"post-modern\\" view, in which cultures within an immigrant nation have blended and inter-married to the extent that toleration becomes an intra-familial affair. Employment Walzer was first employed in 1962 in the politics department at Princeton University. He stayed there until 1966, when he moved to the government department at Harvard. He taught at Harvard until 1980, when he became a permanent faculty member in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1971, Walzer taught a semester-long course at Harvard with Robert Nozick called \\"Capitalism and Socialism\\". The course was a debate between the two philosophers: Nozick's side is delineated in Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), and Walzer's side is expressed in his Spheres of Justice (1983), in which he argues for \\"complex equality\\".Interview with E. J. Dionne Walzer is a member of the editorial board of the Jewish Review of Books and an Advisory Editor at Fathom. Awards and honors In April 2008, Walzer received the prestigious Spinoza Lens, a bi-annual prize for ethics in the Netherlands. He has also been honoured with an emeritus professorship at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study. He was elected to a Fellowship of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 1971, and to a Corresponding Fellowship of the British Academy in 2016. Personal life Walzer is married to Judith Borodovko Walzer. They are parents of two daughters: Sarah Esther Walzer (born 1961) and Rebecca Leah Walzer (born 1966). His grandchildren are Joseph and Katya Barrett, and Jules and Stefan Walzer-Goldfeld. Walzer is the older brother of historian Judith Walzer Leavitt.

He is also the main character of the hack and slash game Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from private military companies. Raiden, who was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in Metal Gear Solid 2 was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for Metal Gear Solid 4. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game Metal Gear Solid: Rising and its reboot Revengeance to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by Kenyu Horiuchi and in English by Quinton Flynn. Raiden's debut role as the protagonist of Metal Gear Solid 2 was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign, especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance where he was found as a better character than in previous installments. Character design Initial concept According to series creator Hideo Kojima, the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels in which the narrator is Dr. Watson rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \\"weak-looking character\\" but decided to follow Kojima. The codename \\"Raiden\\" was based on that of the Mitsubishi J2M Raiden, a historical combat aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service. It was initially planned to be written in katakana as \\"„É©„Ç§„Éá„É≥\\", but was changed to the kanji form \\"Èõ∑Èõª\\" because of a resemblance to Bin Laden's \\"Laden\\" in katakana, \\"„É©„Éº„Éá„Ç£„É≥\\". His full name was going to be \\"Raiden Brannigan\\" but the idea was scrapped. The romantic relationship between Raiden and Rosemary was inspired by Kojima's experiences; their names, Jack and Rose, are a reference to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's lead characters in the film Titanic. In Metal Gear Solid 2, Raiden is considered to be a representation of the player through the experiences between the player and the character during the game. Kojima received much fan mail; one letter from a girl stated she did not want to play a game with an old man. Kojima took this into consideration; he and his team designed Raiden to be more appealing to women. Designer Yoji Shinkawa said he and the other character designers took much inspiration for Raiden's appearance from the bish≈çnen archetype. Because Raiden was a new character, the staff designed him carefully, giving him white hair to symbolize his introduction. Shinkawa also said Raiden had an overall feminine appearance. His outfit‚Äîthe Skull Suit‚Äîwas difficult to design until the staff decided on a \\"bonelike\\" concept. Shinkawa wanted to make Raiden sexually appealing, emphasizing the tightness of his clothing. The design of Raiden's aqua-mask was inspired by ancient mystical ninjutsu, where the ninja bites a scroll in the mouth during magic transformations. Raiden's final duel with the boss Solidus Snake was revised in the making of the game. Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat. Konami kept Raiden's starring role in Metal Gear Solid 2 secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials. Although Raiden appeared in several preview trailers in his scuba gear, his presence was not emphasized. The surprise to fans that Raiden was not Snake was admitted by Kojima to have been inspired by the plot twist of Terminator 2: Judgment Day where the titular character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger was not a villain in that movie. Raiden's appearance in the game was announced to the Japanese press on the day of the game's release in North America. Due to negative response to Raiden's role in the game, Kojima said in retrospective that the team failed to properly show the character. Further development Raiden's new design for Metal Gear Solid 4 was a response to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa was surprised by the way he illustrated Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden's debut in the game's trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden's screenshots. Shinkawa stated Raiden was remade as a darker hero to appeal to the Western fanbase. Seeing Gray Fox as one of his favorite characters, Shinkawa made Raiden be an archetype of such character, making Raiden a cyborg like him. Kojima echoed similar comments, indicating he wanted to expand the character with another game. In designing him, Shinkawa wanted to convey both Raiden's beauty and sorrow in his cybernetic body. He was given the ability to wield swords with his own legs, giving the players the impression he was a ninja. Raiden's first fight against Vamp in the game caused motion and voice actors difficulty because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was satisfied with the outcome, considering it one of the best battles in the game. Two actors were selected for the motion capture of Raiden; one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences. Raiden's fights in Guns of the Patriots were made to assist the weaker Solid Snake and appealed to previous fans of the series who disliked the character. Because Raiden became a more active character in Guns of the Patriots, Kojima expressed a desire in him returning in a future character as playable. Atsushi Inaba from Platinum Games oversaw Raiden's character in Rising When Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was known as Metal Gear Solid: Rising, former producer Shigenobu Matsuyama hinted that Raiden's past as a child soldier would be elaborated upon and his weaknesses as a human would be explored. Matsuyama wanted Raiden to have as strong a role in the game as in Metal Gear Solid 2, leading him to become its main character. Director Mineshi Kimura wanted Raiden to be able to move the way he did in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailers, wanting to show \\"the stealth of the sword, and the strength of not even losing to the gun, and the fear and power you have with this blade\\". Matsuyama said they would focus on Raiden's strong will and physical strength so he would be enjoyable to control. Raiden's design was changed during the game's development, leading to different promotional images of him. Following the game's reboot into a spin- off, developers stated that while Raiden \\"has grown up\\" in comparison to previous Metal Gear games, he is still conflicted with his life as a child soldier in the First Liberian Civil War, leading him to become a \\"dark hero\\". Shinkawa designed Raiden's new body to emphasize his dark heroism, contrasting with his Metal Gear Solid 4 persona. Shimkawa later discussed with Platinum Games' Kenji Saito about including his quasi-human look. Raiden's loss of an eye also represents his transformation across the story while also comparing him with the previous antagonist Solidus Snake. Tamari also explained that the cybernetic functions Raiden has was based on research led by the University of Texas. In response to complaints that Rising appeared to contradict Raiden's ending in Guns of the Patriots, the Kojima Productions staff said the game would explain what happened with Raiden's life. While Steven Armstrong was the game's final antagonist, the character of Jetstream Sam was developed to be Raiden's rival, something Shinkawa and fellow designer Kenichirou Yoshimura worked together to make both of them contrast each other through their visual appearances. The team in charge of Revengeance depicted Raiden as a more mature character than in his previous appearances; they said his swordplay is not based on any samurai and that Raiden's cybernetic body includes heels because they his style of swordplay, where he wields weapons with his feet. When developing the game's, the team thought of Raiden's revenge against his enemies, which resulted in the title \\"Reveangeance\\". Writer Etsu Tamari expressed joy in the final product and expected that in the future, the team could make another game focused on Raiden. In a further analysis of how to write Raiden in Revengeance, Tamari stated he needed a new character that would bring him support in the form of the dog-like robot named Bladewolf; Similar to how Snake guides Raiden in Sons of Liberty, the mature Raiden acts like a mentor to Bladewolf across the story resulting in his character arc. Writer Etsu Tamari wanted to portray Raiden as a more mature person who wishes to take Snake's footsteps. Atsushi Inaba wanted the gameplay of Revengeance fit Raiden's style of characterization, resulting in the use of parries rather than defense. Inaba felt honored to work in Revengeance due to how he was able to see a more mature version of the character to the point of wishing for a sequel. Raiden is first depicted as a white-haired adult who uses a protective suit known as a for his missions in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. In Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots Raiden's entire body below the upper jaw is replaced with a prototype cybernetic body. His original cybernetic body is replaced with a black one that also covers the left eye for Revengeance. Although proficient at all types of weaponry, Raiden specializes in wielding swords that resonate at high frequencies for the last fights in Sons of Liberty, and during Guns of the Patriots and Revengeance. Personality In his first appearances Raiden is a rookie agent who is inexperienced as a result of training only in virtual reality. He later reveals, however, that he was a child soldier known as who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past. This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend Rosemary would not work. Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he has no free will. Solid Snake encourages Raiden to ignore what people tell him and to become self-reliant when problem-solving. His original personality was that of a \\"creep or a weirdo\\", who licked bird doodoo but this was discarded by the staff. Kojima Productions compared the experiences and ways of thinking of Raiden and Solid Snake. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changes upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Snake encourages Raiden to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation to make a new sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima also likened Raiden with John Rambo from the Rambo series because both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution. Raiden himself believes that he is destined to fight based on his upbringing during Revengeance while also following the concept of katsujinken in which samurai kill in order to protect the weak. Portrayal Quinton Flynn has enjoyed doing the English voice for Raiden. In the Japanese versions of the games, Raiden has been voiced by Kenyu Horiuchi, who first saw him as an attractive young man whose actions in Son of Liberty were challenging for his identity. Horiuchi was impressed by the characterization shown across the game, believing him to fit with other members featured in the game. Kojima liked Horiuchi's work, believing Raiden became popular in Japan in part because of his performance, something which he felt the character lacked in Western regions. could understand the character's pain; despite becoming a cyborg, Raiden still acts like a human. Horiuchi took a liking to Raiden's spin-off game, Revengeance, as he acted as the lead for the first time but was still glad that he got meet new actors who appeared in the game, most notably the actor behind Doktor. The actors also liked the inclusion of Raiden's sidekick, LQ-84i (later renamed Bladewolf), as they believe that ninjas like Raiden obligatory need dogs as allies. Another relationship the actors liked was Raiden's exchanges with Courtney due to few female characters being present in the game but felt they made the characters get along properly. Horiuchi felt confident in being in doing Raiden's voice as the lead, believing his thirty years of experience made him suitable for the role. Casting director Kris Zimmerman chose Quinton Flynn, with whom she had previously worked, to voice Raiden in the series' English adaptation. Flynn remembers having a long time to develop the character and being instructed by Zimmerman to use an older voice from a character he previously voiced. Flynn said Raiden was one of his favorite video-game voice characters and noted a difference between his roles in Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4; Flynn was pleased with working alongside David Hayter whom he often interacted while recording the game. The English voice recording was overlooked by Scott Dolph, who reported back saying the English voice for Raiden was more neutral than the original Japanese voice. For Metal Gear Solid 4 Flynn used a deeper voice to match the cyborg Raiden in contrast to the original, youthful Raiden of Metal Gear Solid 2. Flynn said the voice he used was \\"grizzled, yeah‚Äîbut different enough from the style of Snake\\". During development of Metal Gear Solid: Rising, Flynn was not informed about the work despite Raiden being in the trailer. As a result, Flynn kept low hopes in regards to the idea of being cast. Addressing Guns of the Patriotss Raiden as more aggressive than the original one, Flynn stated his favorite take on the character was Revengeances as it there he acted as a \\"blend\\" between the two incarnations. He felt honored for taking the role of Raiden again, having received a \\"Behind The Voice Actors\\" award for his work. In 2015, Flynn stated he was pleased with Raiden's role in Reveangence and that he would have liked a new sequel Raiden as the lead. Internal problems between Kojima Productions and Konami, however, left Flynn worried there might not be another game in the series. Appearances Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty introduces the player to Raiden in the Plant chapter; Jack is introduced as a newly recruited, virtual reality-trained member of FOXHOUND with no live-combat experience before his current mission. He is assisted via Codec by his commanding officer the Colonel and his girlfriend Rosemary. Raiden's initial objective is to rescue several hostages from a terrorist group known as the Sons of Liberty. During his mission, Raiden is helped by mercenary Solid Snake and spy Olga Gurlukovich. As the story progresses, Jack is revealed to be a former child soldier who fought for the Sons of Liberty leader Solidus Snake during the First Liberian Civil War. After the war's end, Raiden was given a normal life and tried to forget his past. It is revealed that a clandestine organization known as The Patriots is controlling his actions and his commanding officer is revealed as their computer-generated Artificial intelligence (AI). One of their spies becomes Raiden's girlfriend and the two fall in love. Raiden defeats Solidus after the Patriots' AIs tell him his death would also trigger those of Olga's child and Rosemary, the latter of whom is revealed to have been pregnant with Raiden's child during the mission. He later reunites with Rosemary, and both decide to stay together to raise their unborn child. Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (set five years after Metal Gear Solid 2) features Raiden after rescuing Olga's daughter Sunny from the Patriots, and searching the corpse of the mercenary Big Boss for Big Mama in exchange. The trauma of his breakup with Rosemary and the apparent miscarriage of his child have made Raiden believe he belongs on the battlefield. Raiden is fitted with a cybernetic exoskeleton as a result of the Patriots' machinations; he helps Solid Snake in the fight against Liquid Ocelot, wanting to obtain the Patriots' powers. However, he is wounded by Vamp in a fight. With his blood having been replaced with a military substitute called that requires regular maintenance, Raiden is treated by Sunny and Doctor Naomi Hunter. Following his recovery, Raiden goes back to Snake, killing Vamp and stays in Ocelot's ship Outer Haven to protect Snake as he shuts down the Patriots' AIs. In an epilogue, Rosemary tells Raiden their child was not miscarried; her marriage to Roy Campbell was a hoax to protect her and their son from the Patriots. Upon hearing this news, Raiden reconciles with Rosemary. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance Raiden returns as the main character in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, which is set four years after Metal Gear Solid 4. He is a member of the private military company (PMC) Maverick Security in multiple tasks while raising money for his family. They are attacked by a group of terrorists called Desperado Enforcement LLC that kill his protectee, N'ani, and leave Raiden near to death with mercenary Jeatstream Sam taking a liking to his fighting style. He is saved by the elder scientist Wilhelm \\"Doktor\\" Voight and starts working with them to fight Desperado. Raiden fights Desperado's LQ-84i, an AI placed in a robot who works for Desperado but Raiden takes pity on it and has Doktor restore it under the name of Bladewolf who assists him. Raiden's vengeful obsession with Desperado becomes personal when he discovers during a mission to Mexico that Desperado and World Marshal Inc have kidnapped several children, surgically removed their brains to place into cybernetic bodies, and were planning to subject them to VR training modeled on his own. Raiden then resigns from Maverick to pursue and retrieve the children's brain cases from World Marshal in Colorado, embracing his sadistic persona \\"Jack the Ripper\\" due to his constant struggles with Sam and Desperado's cyborg Monsoon. Raiden defeats Desperado and learns that Steven Armstrong was using PMCs to distract him as he attempts to create a new War on Terror. When Bladewolf passes Raiden's the word of the late Sam, Raiden stops Armstrong's actions and decides not to return to Maverick and travels to the Middle East to battle World Marshal mercenaries. Other appearances  Raiden does not appear in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater but he is parodied throughout the game by debuting character Raikov. Raiden appears in a series of comical scenes in an early promotional trailer for Guns of the Patriots, in which he fights for control of the franchise with Solid Snake. A sequel to the trailer titled \\"Metal Gear Raiden: Snake Eraser\\" was produced; Raiden travels to the past to assassinate Big Boss but fails comically. In the trailer's English version, Raiden is voiced by Charlie Schlatter (the voice actor for Raikov) rather than Quinton Flynn. Raiden's Metal Gear Solid 2 version appears in the Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus expansion pack as an unlockable character. His Metal Gear Solid 4 incarnation appears as a playable character in Metal Gear Online. In Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Raiden stars in a non-canonical mission titled \\"Jamais Vu\\".

A man turned into a war-machine with no human body for those bastards [body-snatchers] to snatch. he infiltrates Camp Omega under orders from MSF. His aim is to incapacitate a group of soldiers known as the \\"body snatchers\\", a reference to the android replicators in Kojima's video game Snatcher. His appearance in this game is modeled on that in Metal Gear Rising. The Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty 2007 comic book adaptation by Alex Garner retells Raiden's story with few changes. His relationship with Solidus is explored when he remembers his past; when Solidus about to kill him, Raiden is saved by Snake. The game's novelization by Raymond Benson makes minor modifications to Raiden's history, except for the moment he receives Olga's sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills Solidus he cuts the rope on Federal Hall National Memorial's flagpole, causing an American flag to cover his enemy's body. This scene was deleted from the original game due to the September 11 attacks. Outside the Metal Gear series, Raiden appears in the video game LittleBigPlanet as a sticker and a playable sack-boy character in the Metal Gear Solid 4 downloadable content. He is an unlockable character in Evolution Skateboarding. He also appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a collectible sticker and in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood as an alternative skin for Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Raiden is playable in the video games PlayStation All- Stars Battle Royale and Super Bomberman R using his Metal Gear Rising design. The webseries Mega64 includes a parody of Raiden's story in Revengeance; the character struggles against his darker persona while making breakfast. Reception Critical reaction Raiden's replacement of fan favorite Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid 2 proved controversial; GamesRadar considered the replacement a reason to dislike the series. The same site criticized Raiden's role in Metal Gear Solid 2 several times and called his inclusion one of the worst aspects of the game. Snake's voice actor, David Hayter, was also surprised by the inclusion of Raiden in Sons of Liberty believing his character was meant to be the returning protagonist. In 2004, GameAxis Unwired published a fake interview in which Hideo Kojima expressed regret for creating the character. While calling Metal Gear Solid 2 one of the biggest disappointments in video-game history, UGO Networks' Marissa Meli cited Raiden's debut as a key problem with the game. The book Playing with Videogames states that Raiden's inclusion was intended to surprise Metal Gear fans who, instead of playing as Snake, played as his opposite. Writer James Newman commented that fans' reactions were highly negative; they acted as though Kojima had betrayed their expectations. He compared Raiden to the controversial Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks. Newman considered trailers for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater in which Raiden is mocked to be Konami's comic response to fans' disapproval. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell enjoyed Raiden's role, commenting that his interactions with the other characters also helped expand Solid Snake's character. Raiden's introduction was given an award for \\"Biggest Surprise\\" by GameSpot in 2001, while Dave Meikleham from GamesRadar listed his appearance as one of the biggest plot twists in a video game because the trailers did not show him. Meikleham also called Raiden a \\"surprisingly likeable character\\" and found his dynamic with Solid Snake appealing. Before joining Kojima Productions, Ryan Payton stated that he was not disappointed by Raiden's introduction and liked the fact the Metal Gear Solid 2 team kept his identity secret. Raiden's English voice actor Quinton Flynn was surprised by fans' response to the character but said it attracted new fans to the series. Flynn thought fans were angry at the idea that Raiden would replace Snake for all subsequent games. Raiden's relationship with Rosemary was listed as the most awkward part of the Metal Gear series by 1UP.com, with writer Scott Sharkey speculating about Hideo Kojima's life because he said the relationship is autobiographical. ' Response to the character in subsequent games was mainly positive. GamePros Pattrick Shaw analyzed his new design for Metal Gear Solid 4; he said Raiden \\"was in one hell of a fight\\". Raiden's redesign has been praised for reducing his androgynous appearance, thus making him more appealing. UGO placed Raiden's design in that game at 18th on its 2011 list of \\"the most stylin' alternate costumes\\", but Gavin Mackenzie from PLAY listed it seventh on his list of inappropriate outfits, stating that the costume was \\"cool\\" but had unnecessary accessories. It has also been compared with Gray Fox's cybernetic-ninja design in Metal Gear Solid. GameSpot staff stated that Raiden \\"is definitely the inheritor of the quasi-unkillable Cyborg Ninja inheritance\\" when he made his first appearance in a Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer. GameSpot applauded his actions in the trailer, calling it \\"wordlessly awesome\\" and comparing his stunts with those in the film Casshan: Robot Hunter. Writers from Cheat Code Central referred to his fight against Vamp in another trailer as the \\"undeniable highlight\\" that would make player wish to use Raiden in the game. Dave Meikleham of GamesRadar wrote an article titled \\"Why Metal Gear Solid: Rising [Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance] will make you love Raiden\\", writing that fans who disliked the character would find him appealing in the game.

The Escapist said Raiden was now worthy of his own game based on his characterization. Polygon said that while Raiden's actions provide a departure from the stealth games, his actions were referred as \\"outlandish and ridiculous\\". The detail given to Raiden's past was also praised. IGN wrote that fans of Metal Gear Solid 4 would enjoy the game more because Raiden can replicate his moves from that game's cutscenes in gameplay. Eurogamer said a major change in Raiden's characterization is Revengeance, referring to him as a \\"the ultimate cyborg and also the ultimate killer\\" based on his darker persona that is explored in combat. The idea of Raiden primarily using his sword to counterattack firepower was found appealing by Complex due to how Revengeance explores the soldier as a melee fighter. Flynn's performance earned mixed response due to the tones he gives Raiden when interacting with allies and enemies. Popularity Raiden's artwork used as a promotional piece in Leeds, UK, for Revengeance. PLAY editor Nick Jones listed the scene in which Raiden is nude as his fourth-favorite moment of the franchise, calling it the \\"one of the funniest moments in gaming history\\". Lisa Foiles of The Escapist included him on her 2014 list of top five katana wielders, writing \\"this is not a popularity contest and Raiden qualifies\\" even in MGS2 where \\"he was whiny, an emo, and kind of a bitch\\". Raiden proved to be more popular in Japan; according to Yoji Shinkawa this was because he matched the stereotype of the manga hero. Game Informer placed him on \\"The Snubbed List\\" of the best characters of the 2000s in response to his new design because it made fans like the idea of a new Metal Gear game solely focused on Raiden. In a 2010 Famitsu readers' poll, Raiden was voted the 42nd most-popular video game character.

Voice actor Reuben Langdon described Raiden as a character he always wanted to play as most notably on Super Smash Bros. Analysis Raiden's role in Metal Gear Solid 2 has been analyzed by several writers, who said he is intended to represent the player. Early in the game, when Raiden's virtual reality training is mentioned, the game shows scenes from the previous game Metal Gear Solid in which the player takes control of Solid Snake. Raiden's interactions with veteran Solid Snake identify the former as \\"a Metal Gear fan\\". As the game progresses it is stated that Raiden \\"has become Snake\\", having developed skills similar to those he gained from taking part in the Big Shell's fights that resemble Metal Gear Solids Shadow Moses Island. The recurring plot twist involving Raiden's life and the people with whom he often interacts have been praised as being early post-truth content in a video game. Raiden's interaction with the Patriots was also analyzing the way the digital era became relevant over a decade after Sons of Liberty was released.https://nowloading.co/posts/4199069/amp Raiden's development in Sons of Liberty were becomes a stronger soldier for imitating Snake's role in Metal Gear Solid was retold in The Phantom Pain when the player learns their character, Venom Snake, is not the famous Big Boss but instead a doctor who was hypnotized into being a double of the mercenary across the video game. Later in the game, a character tells Raiden to \\"turn off the console\\", which confuses both Raiden and the player; this was first interpreted as a fourth wall-breaking joke but the game's climax goes deeper into Raiden's connection with the player. When his superiors force Raiden to kill the game's antagonist, Solidus Snake, the designers tell the player to finish the game. Both the player and Raiden take different paths at the game's end; the player is told not to waste time playing games while Raiden's character is expanded with his decision to move on with his life, rejecting his previous identity by discarding the dog tags the player wore in the beginning. Upon the revelation of Raiden's new design as a cyborg ninja, writers said he distanced himself from his previous appearance that imitated Solid Snake. Raiden's increasingly masculine redesigns following his debut were noted be a leaning to Western heroes in gaming despite Raiden retaining his original characterization by Todd Harper in the book Queerness in Play. IGN also said Raiden becomes a different type of game hero with a new, direct fighting style. being instead compared with the lead characters from Devil May Cry and God of War favorably due to how they fight. Raiden finding conviction with his inner past persona during Revengeance was noted to go with the ideas of enjoying the hack and slash mechanics provided the developers as Raiden has kill enemies while also being able to face properly all of enemies who share values with him during cutscenes.

He was one of the classic artists of Tintin magazine, alongside Edgar P. Jacobs and Herg√©, of whom he was a longtime collaborator. He is best known for his series Alix. He was born in Strasbourg. Biography After pursuing engineering studies as a young man, Jacques Martin began in 1942 to draw his first comic stories. In 1946, following the end of the War, he travelled through Belgium in search of an editor for his work. Soon afterwards he met Georges Remi (aka Herg√©) with whom he collaborated on several albums of The Adventures of Tintin (and more specifically on Tintin in Tibet and The Red Sea Sharks) while working on his own albums. It was from Herg√© that he learned of the ligne claire style and, under Herg√©'s guidance, began to use it in his own work. He would later be considered one of the great five of the ligne claire style, along with Herg√©, Edgar P. Jacobs, Bob de Moor and Willy Vandersteen. In 1948, he created Alix, his most famous series, published in the magazine Tintin, whose adventures - extremely well researched - occur in Roman antiquity. This historic comic soon became one of the most popular of the genre and went on to be published in several countries worldwide. The story Le spectre de Carthage won the award for best French realistic comic book at the 1978 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. Martin went on to create other characters, beginning with the contemporary journalist Lefranc in 1952. Much later he created others in collaboration with various partners, namely the medieval architect Jhen (initially entitled Xan) in 1978, the French revolutionary officer Arno in 1984, the Athenian Orion in 1990, and the Egyptian Keos in 1992. In 2003, he also started a new series - Lo√Øs set in the court of Louis the sun king of France. In 1998, due to failing eyesight, Martin left the drawing of Alix to Rafael Morales. Alix continues running with great success. Martin died on 21 January 2010.

After serving on the Cleveland City Council from 1938 to 1939 and the Ohio State Senate from 1940 to 1942, Vanik enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve, seeing action in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters. After the war, Vanik served as a city judge from 1946 to 1954. United States House of Representatives In 1954, he ran for Ohio's 21st congressional district. The district, located on Cleveland's East Side, was evenly divided between African Americans, who were solidly Republican, and whites, who were mostly Democrats. In the Democratic primary, Vanik defeated longtime incumbent Congressman Robert Crosser as well as African-American challenger John Holly, founder of the Negro Future Outlook League. In the general election, Vanik defeated African-American Republican Francis E. Young, who helped organize the Cleveland branch of the NAACP. Vanik shifted districts in 1968 to the neighboring , to make way for Louis Stokes whose growing political operation had challenged him in previous races, defeating Frances P. Bolton, who had served the district since 1939. Vanik served in the district until 1981. In 1974, Vanik sponsored the Jackson-Vanik amendment with Sen. Henry \\"Scoop\\" Jackson, which denied normal trade relations to certain countries with non-market economies that restricted the freedom of emigration. The amendment was intended to allow refugees, particularly religious minorities, to escape from the Soviet Bloc. During this time, Vanik was the chair of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade. He used to insert into the Congressional Record what he called the \\"Annual Corporate Tax Study\\" in which he'd list corporations that paid little to no federal income taxes. In 1982, Vanik contested for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant-governor of Ohio as running mate with Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown who was running for governor. The ticket lost to Richard F. Celeste and Myrl Shoemaker. Vanik was known for wearing black bow ties with every suit. Death Vanik died in his sleep on August 30, 2007 at his home in Jupiter, Florida.

Jacobs, was a Belgian comic book creator (writer and artist), born in Brussels, Belgium. He was one of the founding fathers of the European comics movement, through his collaborations with Herg√© and the graphic novel series that made him famous, Blake and Mortimer. Biography Edgar F√©lix Pierre Jacobs was born in Brussels in 1904.De Weyer, Geert (2005). \\"Edgar Pierre Jacobs\\". In Belgi√´ gestript, pp. 129‚Äì131. Tielt: Lannoo. Jacobs remembered having drawn for as far back as his memory would go. His real love though was for the dramatic arts and the opera in particular. In 1919 he graduated from the commercial school where his parents had sent him, and privately swore he would never work in an office. He kept on drawing in his spare time, focusing his greatest attention on musical and dramatic training. He took on odd jobs at the opera, including decoration, scenography, and painting, and sometimes got to work as an extra. In 1929 he received the annual Belgian government medal for excellence in classical singing. Financial good fortune did not follow, since the Great Depression hit the Brussels artistic community very hard. After a career as extra and baritone singer in opera productions between 1919 and 1940 in Brussels and Lille, punctuated by small drawing commissions, Jacobs turned permanently to illustration, drawing commercial illustrations and collaborating in the children's weekly comic magazine Bravo until 1946, after he was introduced there by Jacques Laudy. This review or periodical was a smashing success, hitting a circulation of 300,000 at times. When the American comic strip Flash Gordon was prohibited in Belgium by the German occupation authorities during World War II, he was asked to write an end to the comic in order to provide a denouement to the readers. German censorship banned this continuation after only a couple of weeks. Jacobs subsequently published his first comic strip in Bravo, Le Rayon U (The U Ray), largely in the same Flash Gordon style. Around this time, he became a stage painter for a theatre adaptation for Herg√©'s Cigars of the Pharaoh. Although the play was only a modest success, it brought him into contact with Herg√© and the two quickly become friends. As a direct result, he assisted Herg√© in colorizing the black and white strips of The Shooting Star from Le Soir in preparation for book publication in 1942, and from 1944 on he helped him in the recasting of his earlier albums Tintin in the Congo, Tintin in America, King Ottokar's Sceptre and The Blue Lotus for color book publication. After the project, he continued to contribute directly in the drawing as well as the storyline for the new Tintin double-albums The Seven Crystal Balls/Prisoners of the Sun. Jacobs, as a fan of opera, decided to take Herg√© with him to a concert. Herg√© did not like opera, however, and for decades he would gently lampoon his friend Jacobs through the device of opera singer Bianca Castafiore, a supporting character in The Adventures of Tintin. Herg√© also gave him tiny cameo roles in Tintin adventures, sometimes under the name Jacobini, for example in The Calculus Affair where Jacobini is the name of an opera singer advertised as starring alongside La Castafiore in Gounod's Faust, and as a mummified egyptologist on the cover of Cigars of the Pharaoh, as well as in the rewritten version. In a 1977 interview with the BBC (excerpted in 2016 on the Witness radio program/podcast), Herg√© stated that Jacobs was part of his inspiration for the major character of Captain Haddock: \\"He [Jacobs] is just like Captain Haddock, full of movement...bursting into...invective.\\" In 1946, Jacobs was part of the team gathered by Raymond Leblanc around the new Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin, where his story Le secret de l‚ÄôEspadon (The Secret of the Swordfish) was published on 26 September, the first of the Blake and Mortimer series. In 1947, Jacobs asked to share the credit with Herg√© on The Adventures of Tintin. When Herg√© refused, their collaboration suffered a bit of a setback. Herg√© still remained a friend however, and as before Blake et Mortimer continued to be serialised in Tintin magazine. In 1950, Jacobs published The Mystery of the Great Pyramid. Many others soon followed. Jacobs finally published in 1970 the first volume of The Three formulas of Professor Sato, which was staged in Japan. In 1973 he restyled his first full-length album, Le Rayon U, and wrote his autobiography under the title Un op√©ra de papier: Les m√©moires de Blake et Mortimer. He then wrote the scenario for the second episode of Les Trois Formules du Professeur Sato, but the artwork remained unfinished at the time of his death. Bob de Moor was drafted in to complete the album, which was published in 1990. Jacobs has two stone sphinxes to commemorate him. One of them is in the Bois des Pauvres near Brussels, where his home used to stand, and the other one is over his tomb at the Lasne cemetery, also near Brussels. The cemetery sphinx has a \\"collar\\" beard, and his face looks a lot like Philip Mortimer, the protagonist of most of the Jacobs albums. Jacobs' style varies greatly from one album to another. There are however many common threads, such as the theme of subterranean descent and the consistent Ligne claire drawing style.

It superseded Pope Paul VI's 1975 apostolic constitution, Romano Pontifici eligendo, and all previous apostolic constitutions and orders on the subject of the election of the Roman Pontiff. Universi Dominici gregis (\\"the Lord's whole flock\\", from the opening statement \\"The Shepherd of the Lord's whole flock is the Bishop of the Church of Rome, ...\\"), subtitled On the Vacancy of the Apostolic See and the Election of the Roman Pontiff, deals with the vacancy of the See of Rome, i.e., the papacy. The constitution modified or in some cases confirmed the rules, for the conclave. It also clarified, during a sede vacante, which matters could be handled by the College of Cardinals and which matters were reserved for the future pope. Contents Universi Dominici gregis consists of an introduction followed by a body of 92 numbered sections, normally just one paragraph but occasionally more than one, and a concluding \\"Promulgation\\", which activates the document. The body is divided into two parts, but the 92 sections are numbered continuously. ;Part One During a sede vacante, the College has no power in things which pertain to the pope during his lifetime or of his office. Any such act that the College exercises beyond the limits expressly permitted by this document is null and void. * To be eligible to vote, a cardinal must be no more than eighty years of age on the day before the death or resignation of the pope. * The maximum number of cardinals who can participate in a conclave is 120. There is no restriction on the number of cardinals over the age of 80. * A vote may or may not be taken on the afternoon of the first day. If such a vote occurs, only one vote shall take place and it is counted separately for purposes of determining when a change in the balloting requirements can be made, as explained elsewhere in this constitution. * Excluding the afternoon of the first day, a maximum of four votes are taken each day, two votes in the morning and two in the afternoon. * On the first 33 ballots taken (or 34, if a ballot was cast on the afternoon of the first day), a pope shall be elected by a vote of two-thirds of those participating in the conclave. Thereafter, an absolute majority of the conclave participants may change the rule that a two-thirds vote is required for election to a different threshold, but a valid election always requires an absolute majority of the votes. (This was later modified by Benedict XVI.) ;Part Two Chapter II deals with arrangements involving the public viewing and burial of the deceased pope and matters after his death and it provides for the organization of the College into a General Congregation and a Particular Congregation. *The General Congregation consists of the entire College of Cardinals. Attendance at meetings is mandatory for all cardinals who have arrived at the Vatican to participate in the selection of the new pope except for those over age 80, whose attendance is optional. This Congregation handles matters of major importance that cannot be handled by the Particular Congregation. *The Particular Congregation consists of the Cardinal Camerlengo and three Cardinals, one from each order chosen by lot from the General Congregation. Except for the Camerlengo, the term of each of these three cardinals is three days. This Congregation handles routine matters. Any decision of a Particular Congregation cannot be changed by a later Particular Congregation, but only by a majority vote of the General Congregation. Major changes Secrecy Strict secrecy is to be ensured throughout the process. Anyone violating the security of the Vatican, introducing recording equipment, or communicating with a cardinal elector in any way, risks excommunication. Other penalties are at the discretion of the incoming Pope. Participants are required to take oaths of secrecy. Methods of election Previously, in addition to secret ballot two other methods were allowed for the conduct of the election. A committee of nine to fifteen unanimously chosen cardinals might have been delegated, to make the choice for all (election by compromise, per compromissum). Alternatively, formal ballots could be discarded: in election by acclamation (per acclamationem seu inspirationem) the electors simultaneously shouted out the name of their preferred candidate. Both of these methods have now been abolished: the rationale given was that either compromise or acclamation would not require each cardinal to express his preference. Also, these two methods tended to produce controversy, and in any case neither had been used for quite some time‚Äîthe last compromise election was of Pope John XXII in 1316, and the last affirmation (acclamation) election was of Innocent XI in 1676. As a result, election by secret ballot is now the only valid method of electing a Pope. Living quarters Universi Dominici gregis provided that Cardinals would be housed in Domus Sanctae Marthae, a building with dormitory type accommodation built within the Vatican City. Previously Cardinals were housed in improvised accommodations which were often noted for not being particularly comfortable. Other * New voting procedures allowed for the election of a pope by a simple majority in certain circumstances. * For the first time in centuries cardinals were to be housed in apartments separate from the Sistine Chapel. * The method by which a pope symbolically took office was made less specific. Whereas Pope Paul's Romano Pontifici Eligendo spoke of a coronation, the new apostolic constitution referred to the \\"inauguration of the pontificate\\" without choosing between an enthronement ceremony, a papal coronation or the papal inauguration used since 1978. *The document anticipated the possibility of a papal resignation when specifying that the procedures it prescribes should be observed \\"even if the vacancy of the Apostolic See should occur as a result of the resignation of the Supreme Pontiff\\".(para. 77) Later use and amendment The only papal election held under these rules without amendment was that of 2005 that chose John Paul's successor Benedict XVI. On 11 June 2007, Pope Benedict XVI reinstated the requirement that a papal election require a two-thirds majority regardless of the number ballots taken. Includes links to translations in French and German. After Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation, on 25 February 2013, he issued another decree, Normas nonnullas, which allowed the College of Cardinals to bring forward the start of a conclave once all cardinals are present or delay the start a few days if serious reasons justify the change in scheduling. He also amended the rules to declare automatic excommunication of any non-cardinal who broke the oath of secrecy of the College of Cardinals during the proceedings. Previously any such person was subject to punishment at the discretion of the new pope. The new rules were first applied in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis.

Roca is the most important representatives of the Generation of '80 and is known for directing the \\"Conquest of the Desert\\", a series of military campaigns against the indigenous peoples of Patagonia. During his two terms as president, many important changes occurred, particularly major infrastructure projects of railroads and port facilities; increased foreign investment, along with immigration from Europe; large-scale immigration from southern Europe; expansion of the agricultural and pastoral sectors of the economy; and laicizing legislation strengthening state power. Roca's main foreign policy concern was to set the limits with Chile, which had never been determined with precision. Roca took advantage of the fact that year of 1881, Chile was fighting the War of the Pacific against Bolivia and Peru, so for Chile it was strategically important not to have a second military front. Argentina gained territory by treaty with Chile. Upbringing and early career Roca was born in the northwestern city of San Miguel de Tucum√°n in 1843 into a prominent local family. He graduated from the National College in Concepci√≥n del Uruguay, Entre R√≠os. Before he was 15, Roca joined the army of the Argentine Confederation, on 19 March 1858. While still an adolescent, he went to fight as a junior artillery officer in the struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, first on the side of the provinces and later on behalf of the capital. He also fought in the War of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay between 1865 and 1870. Roca rose to the rank of colonel serving in the war to suppress the revolt of Ricardo L√≥pez Jord√°n in Entre R√≠os. President Nicol√°s Avellaneda later promoted him to General after his victory over rebel general Jos√© M. Arredondo in the battle of Santa Rosa, leading the loyalist forces. Roca saw the army \\"as an agent of national unification,\\" and his experience in the army \\"broadened his understanding of Argentina and the provincial upper class.\\"Douglas A. Richmond, \\"Julio Argentino Roca\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 4 p. 583. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Political beginnings In 1878, during Avellaneda's presidency, he became Minister of War and it was his task to prepare a campaign that would bring an end to the \\"frontier problem\\" after the failure of the plan of Adolfo Alsina (his predecessor). A number of indigenous groups defended their traditional territories and frequently assaulted non-indigenous frontier settlements, taking horses and cattle, and capturing women and children, who were enslaved or offered as brides to the warriors.Argentina: Countries of the World, Erika Wittekind, p. 67, ABDO, 01/09/2011Captive Women: Oblivion And Memory In Argentina, Susana Rotker, p.32, University of Minnesota Press, 04/12/2002 Roca's approach to dealing with the Indian communities of the Pampas, however, was completely different from Alsina's, who had ordered the construction of a ditch and a defensive line of small fortresses across the Province of Buenos Aires. Roca saw no way to end native attacks (malones) but by putting under effective government control all land up to the R√≠o Negro in a campaign (known as the Conquest of the Desert) that would \\"extinguish, subdue or expel\\" the Indians who lived there. \\"He began the campaign against the Ranqueles\\", which eventually resulted in the \\"transfer of 35% of national territory from the Indians to local caudillos.Richmond, \\"Julio A.

The April 11 elections for president, which came a sweeping victory for the voters of Roca, except in Buenos Aires and Corrientes. On June 13 the Electoral College met and elected President General Roca and Vice President Francisco Bernab√© Madero. But in Buenos Aires it was brewing a revolution against the triumph of Roca. Four days later the fighting began, which ended on June 25 with an agreement between the province and the nation; the revolution of 1880 had cost 3,000 dead. Shortly before the presidential inauguration Roca was passed in Congress federalization of Buenos Aires. Under his mandate the so-called \\"laicist laws\\" (Leyes Laicas) were passed, which nationalized a series of functions that previously were under the control of the Church. He also created the so-called Registro Civil, an index of all births, deaths and marriages. President Roca also made primary education free of charge by nationalizing education institutions run by the Church. This led to a break in relations with the Vatican. Roca presided over an era of rapid economic development fueled by large scale European immigration, railway construction, and booming agricultural exports. In May 1886 Roca was the subject of a failed assassination attempt. Continuing political involvement Roca himself had put forward Ju√°rez Celman as his successor, who was his brother-in-law. However, Celman distanced himself from Roca. Celman's government was ultimately tarnished by the Baring crisis and corruption allegations. Roca did not participate in the 1890 revolution attempt against Celman, which was instigated by Leandro N. Alem and Bartolom√© Mitre (Uni√≥n C√≠vica, later Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical). However, he was pleased in the resulting weakness of Miguel Ju√°rez Celman. After his first presidency Roca remained important politically, becoming a senator and Minister of the Interior under Carlos Pellegrini. After President Luis S√°enz Pe√±a resigned in January 1895, Jos√© Evaristo Uriburu took over the presidency, when Roca was President of the Senate. Because of this, Roca again assumed the duties of President between 28 October 1895 and 8 February 1896, when Uriburu was ill. Second presidency In the middle of 1897 the Partido Autonomista Nacional party put forward Roca as a presidential candidate once more. Unopposed, he was able to begin a second regular term in office on 12 October 1898. During his second presidency, the Ley de Residencia law was passed, which made it possible to expel some of Argentina's trade union leaders, who were noncitizen anarchists and socialists deemed dangerous to Argentina.Richmond, \\"Julio A. Roca\\" p. 584 During this presidency military service was introduced in 1901 and a border dispute with Chile was settled in 1902. Luis Drago, Roca‚Äôs foreign minister, articulated the Drago Doctrine of 1902 asserting that foreign powers could not collect public debts from sovereign American states by armed force or occupation of territory. Argentina's foreign debt increased in this period, although economic growth continued. Roca was unable to continue his political domination, and he was unable to essentially name his successor. Roca's second term ended in 1904, and is considered less successful than his first.Richmond, \\"Julio A. Roca\\", p. 584. Later years Tomb of Julio Argentino Roca, Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires. In 1912 Roca was appointed as Special Ambassador of Argentina to Brazil by President Roque S√°enz Pe√±a. Roca returned to Argentina in 1914 and died in Buenos Aires on October 19, 1914. He was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. His son, Julio Argentino Roca, Jr., became vice-president of Argentina in 1932 to 1938. Legacy and controversy During the twentieth century, Roca was recognized as one of the statesmen who forged the foundations of the modern Argentine republic. As such, Roca has been honored by designating cities, departments, lakes, streets, avenues, squares, monuments, parks, schools and railway lines throughout the country. Examples include the city of General Roca in the province of R√≠o Negro, the town of Presidencia Roca in the province of Chaco; the town of Presidente Roca in the province of Santa Fe; the Colonia Roca of the province of Entre R√≠os; the General Roca Department of the province of C√≥rdoba. In Buenos Aires, a major thoroughfare and a railway branch are named for him and an equestrian statue of him was erected in 1941. In recent years, there has been an increasing re-evaluation of Roca's place in Argentine history, particularly his involvement in the Conquest of the Desert. Some groups claim that he committed genocide against the Native Argentines.Rory Carroll, ‚ÄúArgentinian founding father recast as genocidal murderer‚Äù, The Guardian, 13 January 2011Philip McCouat, \\"Art and Survival in Patagonia\\", Journal of Art in Society, http://www.artinsociety.com Those who consider Roca as genocidal have proposed removing the name Roca from the places and areas with which it has been honored.

He decided not to contract new debts, and personally renegotiated the existing ones in London: the financial situation forced the bankers to accept the conditions imposed by the Minister of Finance , Juan Jos√© Romero, who got some cuts in the capital and a somewhat longer term. By mid-1893, the crisis could be considered over.

The photographer's account of an over-crowded photograph was used to accuse Feldman of misrepresenting a fundamental fact in the story, namely whether he was purposefully cropped out of the picture, as many other class members were also cropped from the newsletter photograph due to space limitations.\\"Snap, Crackle, But Not Cropped\\", thejewishweek.com His supporters noted that Feldman's claim in the article was that he and his girlfriend were \\"nowhere to be found\\" and not that they were cropped or deleted out of the photograph. Yet others view this claim by Feldman's supporters as disingenuous, noting that elsewhere Feldman had publicly encouraged the suggestion of air-brushing. Leon Wieseltier attacked Feldman for the dishonesty of \\"exposing the depredations\\" of Orthodox Jewish law while praising sharia as \\"bold and noble,\\" and called Feldman's essay a \\"pathetic whine.\\"Wieseltier, Leon. \\"Theologico-Politicus\\", The New Republic His critique of Modern Orthodox Judaism has been commented on by many, including Hillel Halkin, columnist for the New York Sun; Andrew Silow-Carroll, editor of the New Jersey Jewish News; Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union; Marc B. Shapiro Rabbi Shalom Carmy, tenured professor of Jewish philosophy at Yeshiva University; Rabbi Norman Lamm, chancellor of Yeshiva University; Rabbi Shmuley Boteach;Shmuley Boteach, \\"Stop Ostracizing the Intermarried\\" , Jerusalem Post Gary Rosenblatt, editor of Jewish Week, the editorial board of the Jewish Press;\\"Feldman's Complaint\\" by Editorial Board \\"Conceding a Point to Feldman?\\" by Editorial Board Rabbis Ozer Glickman and Aharon Kahn, roshei yeshiva at Yeshiva University;Rabbi Aharon Kahn: Selichos and Noah Feldman Ami Eden, executive editor of The Forward; Rabbi David M. Feldman, author of Where There's Life, There's Life; and Jonathan Rosenblum, columnist for the Jerusalem Post. In addition, the American Thinker published responses by Ralph M. Lieberman, Richard Baehr, and Thomas Lifson. Feldman also argued pro bono in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals against the efforts of a Jewish group in Tenafly, New Jersey, the Tenafly Eruv Association, to erect an eruv. However, his arguments were rejected in 2003 and the eruv was permitted.Rosenblum, Jonathan. \\"Think Again: Feldman's bad faith\\" , The Jerusalem Post, August 9, 2007. Accessed April 21, 2008. \\"But the clearest evidence of Feldman's animus for modern Orthodoxy is absent from his piece: his pro bono representation of the city of Tenafly, New Jersey in its efforts to prevent the construction of an eruv. Feldman knew full well that the absence of an eruv allowing the wheeling of baby carriages on Shabbat would prevent modern Orthodox Jews, like his former classmates, from being able to move to the suburbs, and that the Tenafly litigation would serve as a precedent in many similar battles raging around the country.\\" During the Amish \\"beard-cutting\\" attacks trial of 2012, Feldman argued against applying the Federal hate-crimes law in the case. He argued in a Bloomberg View column that strife amongst co-religionists, including for example \\"two gangs of ultra-Orthodox Hasidic teenagers from competing sects,\\" could be brought under the law. Any dispute that takes place in the context of a church, mosque, or synagogue would be ripe for federal intervention. Over time, a hate-crimes law designed as a shield to protect religious groups against bias could easily become a sword with which to prosecute them, he then concluded. Subsequently, the sixteen Amish men and women in the 2012 case were found guilty.Eckholm, Erik, \\"Jury Convicts Amish Group of Hate Crimes\\", New York Times, September 20, 2012. Retrieved 2012-09-20. Public perception Feldman's work on the Iraqi constitution was controversial at the time, and some, including Edward Said, felt he was not experienced enough with the country to undertake such a task. In 2008, he was among the names topping Esquire magazine's list of the \\"most influential people of the 21st century\\". The magazine called him \\"a public intellectual of our time.\\" In 2005, The New York Observer called Feldman \\"one of a handful of earnest, platinum-r√©sum√©‚Äôd law geeks whose prospects for the Big Bench are the source of constant speculation among friends and colleagues.\\" New York Magazine named Feldman as one of \\"the influentials\\" in ideas, and later, as ‚Äúmost beautiful brainiac‚Äù in The Most Beautiful People issue. In 2011, Feldman appeared in all three episodes in the Ken Burns PBS series, Prohibition, as a legal commentator. Feldman has given two TED main stage talks: one in 2003 entitled ‚ÄúPolitics and Religion Are Technologies,‚Äù and one in 2017 entitled ‚ÄúHamilton vs. Madison and the Birth of American Partisanship,‚Äù the latter of which has been viewed more than 2 million times. Feldman has appeared on The Colbert Report, Charlie Rose, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Maddow, as well as numerous other appearances on ABC, NBC, CNN, and MSNBC. On December 4, 2019, Feldman‚Äîalongside law professors Pamela Karlan, Michael Gerhardt, and Jonathan Turley‚Äîtestified before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the constitutional grounds for presidential impeachment in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Works and publications Books Feldman has published 8 non- fiction books and 2 casebooks. After Jihad: America and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy (2003) contends that support of violent jihad in the Muslim world is declining in favor of popularity for both Islam and democracy. Explaining shared traits of Islam and democracy, such as equality and flexibility, Feldman argues that the two are in fact compatible and that ‚Äúdemocracy in the Arab world should be Islamic in character.‚Äù What We Owe Iraq: War and the Ethics of Nation Building (2004) argues that ‚Äúhaving broken the Iraqi government, Washington has an obligation to bring about a new and better one‚ÄùL.

Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR‚Äôs Great Supreme Court Justices (2010) focuses on four of Roosevelt‚Äôs Supreme Court appointees: Felix Frankfurter, Hugo Black, Robert Jackson, and William O. Douglas, and ‚Äúhow the backgrounds, personalities, and experiences of the four justices shaped their philosophies and how those philosophies changed the Court from a conservative one resisting America‚Äôs liberal turn under FDR into the liberal one that helped remake the nation.‚Äù This group biography demonstrates that their competing judicial philosophies ‚Äúare the ones that continue to preoccupy lawyers, law professors and judges.‚Äù Cool War: The Future of Global Competition (2013) is about the relationship between the United States and China, as ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs two biggest economies are fated to remain geopolitical frenemies, locked in a chilly embrace necessitated by economic interdependence but made tense by constant military and political rivalry in Asia and, increasingly, the rest of the world.‚Äù As each side vies for supremacy, Feldman warns, the Cool War has the potential to become a hot war.

Instead of buying a magazine like Soap Opera Digest, in which all soap operas are covered, Soaps In Depth gave the soap viewer and potential shopper individual choices from the \\"Big Three\\" networks: ABC Soaps In Depth, CBS Soaps In Depth, and NBC Soaps In Depth. Each magazine is devoted to only the shows on the network the edition covers and is published biweekly. The NBC edition was discontinued after only two years in 1999 after NBC cancelled Another World and Sunset Beach, making it superfluous to cover only two programs, while the ABC and CBS editions continue to be sold. In April 2020, it was announced that the physical publishings would cease. Soaps Magazine   CBS Soaps In Depth  First published in early 1997, this magazine focuses only on the CBS soaps The Bold and the Beautiful and The Young and the Restless. Previously, Guiding Light and As The World Turns were covered as well before their cancellation. Each issue also includes a special section for Days of Our Lives, brief news coverage, previews, and recaps for General Hospital and Days Of Our Lives. When the CBS edition debuted, each issue cost $2.99. Currently, the CBS edition costs $3.99 American and $4.50 Canadian.  ABC Soaps In Depth  First published in February 1997, this magazine focused on the ABC soaps at that time (All My Children, The City, General Hospital, and One Life to Live). A few months later, The City was cancelled, and coverage began on the new soap, Port Charles. PC was cancelled in 2003, and coverage continued on the other three soaps. The ABC edition also includes news coverage, previews, and recaps for the CBS soaps and Days of our Lives. Its initial start up cost was $2.99 an issue, with an occasional $1.00 issue. Beginning in 2003, each issue costs $3.99. After the cancellations of AMC and OLTL in 2011 and 2012, respectively, with GH being the only ABC daytime soap to still air to this day, the ABC edition now also includes brief sections for its NBC soap Days of Our Lives and the CBS soaps.  NBC Soaps In Depth  The NBC edition is now defunct. When it was first published, coverage focused on NBC Daytime's soap line-up, which was Another World, Days of Our Lives, and Sunset Beach. In 1999, NBC cancelled the long running AW, as well as Sunset Beach. Passions took over one time slot, but with this drastic move in NBC Daytime, the need for its own magazine was no longer there. NBC's last remaining serial, Days of our Lives, still holds brief news coverage, previews, and recaps in the ABC and CBS editions. It receives more coverage in the ABC edition, as ABC itself only has one soap opera remaining on the air (General Hospital). Features Recurring articles Each issue consists of recurring columns which may touch on any of the respective network soaps: * News - Updates on important news stories. * Ins and Outs - Updates on cast changes. * Set Your DVR - Previews for the coming two weeks. * On the Town - Candid photos of stars at events, parties, award ceremonies, and actors/actresses who may be doing a Broadway show. * In Depth Cover Story - Major plot development coming up on a particular show, with sporadic Cover Stories for each show. * Hottest Stories - Upcoming plot developments in popular storylines. * We Speak Out - The editors' opinions on storylines. * Readers' Poll - Results of poll questions asked in a recent issue, as well as top couples, actors, and actresses. * In Depth Answers - Fan questions answered. * Primetime Soaps In Depth - Feature interviews about current Primetime shows. * Gold Star - An award for a top performance by an actor. * Standout Scene - Recap and acknowledgement of a particularly powerful scene. * Star Talk - Question asked by the magazine for the actors and actresses. * Storyline Recaps - Article explaining major storyline twists that occurred in the last two weeks. * Soap Style - Brief articles about what an actress (and sometimes actor) wore to an event. * In the Next Issue - Previews of articles in the upcoming issue. Rotating articles Each issue contains a number of alternating columns which may not appear every week: * Keeping Track - Catching up with an actor or actress who formerly appeared on a current soap. * Old Friends - Catching up with an actor or actress who appeared on a now- defunct soap. * Flashback - Soap actors and actresses reflecting on their former characters. * Take This Job And Love It! - A Q&A; with actors over their favorite aspects of their jobs. * A Minute of Your Time Please - A quick-hit Q&A; asking questions of an actor in 60 seconds. * Studio In Depth - Fun candid photos at a Soaps In Depth photo shoot. * Beauty Secrets - Fashion and beauty questions asked by the fans, as well as questions for the actors, asked by the magazine. * Wedding Album - Photos and memories from popular soap weddings. * Special features which look at storylines, characters or couples across the soaps, usually grouped together under a specific theme for the issue. Show sections All three soaps in the CBS edition and ABC edition have their own special sections, mostly scoops from cast members, writers, or executive producers. These include: *In Depth sections for each show - these include special features such as: ** Feature Interviews ** Behind the Scenes ** On the Road ** Off-Duty There are also several special articles for each show.

Note the high ground clearance due to portal gear axles. An off-road vehicle is considered to be any type of vehicle which is capable of driving on and off paved or gravel surface. It is generally characterized by having large tires with deep, open treads, a flexible suspension, or even caterpillar tracks. Other vehicles that do not travel public streets or highways are generally termed off-highway vehicles, including tractors, forklifts, cranes, backhoes, bulldozers, and golf carts. Off-road vehicles have an enthusiastic following because of their versatility. Several types of motorsports involve racing off-road vehicles. The most common use of these vehicles is for sight seeing in areas distant from pavement. The use of higher clearance and higher traction vehicles enables access on trails and forest roads that have rough and low traction surfaces. History Nicholas II's Packard Twin-6 with K√©gresse track One of the first modified off-road vehicles was the K√©gresse track, a conversion undertaken first by Adolphe K√©gresse, who designed the original while working for Czar Nicholas II of Russia between 1906 and 1916.MiG-registeret The system uses an unusual caterpillar track which has a flexible belt rather than interlocking metal segments. It can be fitted to a conventional car or truck to turn it into a half-track suitable for use over rough or soft ground. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, K√©gresse returned to his native France where the system was used on Citro√´n cars between 1921 and 1937 for off-road and military vehicles. The Citro√´n company sponsored several overland expeditions with their vehicles crossing North Africa and Central Asia. A huge wheeled vehicle designed from 1937 to 1939 under the direction of Thomas Poulter called Antarctic Snow Cruiser was intended to facilitate transport in the Antarctica. While having several innovative features, it generally failed to operate as hoped under the difficult conditions, and was eventually abandoned in Antarctica. After World War II, a huge surplus of light off-road vehicles like the Jeep and heavier lorries were available on the market. The Jeeps in particular were popular with buyers who used them as utility vehicles. This was also the start of off-roading as a hobby. The wartime Jeeps soon wore out, though, and the Jeep company started to produce civilian derivatives, closely followed by similar vehicles from British Land Rover and Japanese Toyota, Datsun/Nissan, Suzuki, and Mitsubishi. These were all alike: small, compact, four-wheel-drive vehicles with at most a small hardtop to protect the occupants from the elements. From the 1960s and onward, more comfortable vehicles were produced. For several years they were popular with rural buyers due to their off-road and load-lugging capabilities. The U.S. Jeep Wagoneer and the Ford Bronco, the British Range Rover, and the station wagon-bodied Japanese Toyota Land Cruiser, Nissan Patrol and Suzuki Lj's series were all essentially just station wagon bodies on light truck frames with four-wheel- drive drivetrains. Later, during the 1990s, manufacturers started to add even more luxuries to bring those off-road vehicles on par with regular cars. This eventually evolved into what we call the SUV today. It also evolved into the newer crossover vehicle, where utility and off-road capability was sacrificed for better on-road handling and luxury. Technical Bv206 with wide rubber tracks To be able to drive off the pavement, off-road vehicles need several characteristics: They need to have a low ground pressure, so as not to sink into soft ground, they need ground clearance to not get hung up on obstacles, and they need to keep their wheels or tracks on the ground so as not to lose traction. Wheeled vehicles accomplish this by having a suitable balance of large or additional tires combined with tall and flexible suspension. Tracked vehicles accomplish this by having wide tracks and a flexible suspension on the road wheels. Russian GAZ-34039 The choice of wheels versus tracks is one of cost and suitability. A tracked drivetrain is more expensive to produce and maintain. Wheeled drivetrains are cheaper and give a higher top speed. The tracked drivetrain has greater off-road capability. Tires play a significant role for any off-road vehicle equipped with wheels, as they ensure optimal traction required to keep it moving. The off-road tire tread types vary depending on the terrain type. The most common types of off-road tires are A/T (stands for \\"All Terrain\\") and M/T (stands for \\"Mud Terrain\\"). While the A/T tires perform excellently on the sand, they are barely usable in the mud. There are also unique Sand Blaster and Mud bogging tires used for the most challenging terrains such as dirt, sand and even water to maintain traction at extreme angles and high speeds (off-road motorsport). Most off-road vehicles are fitted with especially low gearing. This allows the operator to make the most of the engine's available power while moving slowly through challenging terrain. An internal combustion engine coupled to a normal gearbox often has an output speed too high. The vehicle often has one of two things, either a very low (\\"granny\\") first gear (like the all wheel drive Volkswagen Transporter versions) or an additional gearbox in line with the first, called a reduction drive. Some vehicles, like the Bv206 in the picture on the right, also have torque converters to further reduce the gearing. Many wheeled off- road vehicles provide power to all wheels to keep traction on slippery surfaces. For a typical four-wheel vehicle this is known as four-wheel drive. Vehicles designed for use both on and off-road may be designed to be switched between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive so that the vehicle uses fewer driven wheels when driven on the road. Criticism of off-road vehicles Safety SUVs are built with higher ground clearance for off-road use and thus have a higher center of gravity, therefore increasing the risk of rollover. When an SUV turns, the vehicle's mass resists the turn and carries the weight forward, thus allowing the traction from the tires to create a lateral centripetal force as the vehicle continues through the turn. The conflict between the top weight of the SUV's desire to go straight while the friction of the tires on the road cause the bottom of the vehicle to move away and out from under the vehicle during a turn. SUVs are more likely to be in rollover accidents than passenger cars. According to a study conducted in the United States, SUVs have twice the fatality rate of cars and have nearly triple the fatality rate in rollover accidents. Of vehicles in the United States, light trucks (including SUVs) represent 36 percent of all registered vehicles. They are involved in about half of the fatal two-vehicle crashes with passenger cars, and 80 percent of these fatalities are to occupants of the passenger cars. Environment In the United States, the number of ORV users since 1972 has climbed sevenfold‚Äîfrom five million to 36 million in 2000. Government policies that protect wilderness but also allow recreational ORV use have been the subject of some debate within the United States and other countries. All trail and off-trail activities impact natural vegetation and wildlife, which can lead to erosion, invasive species, habitat loss, and ultimately species loss decreasing an ecosystem's ability to maintain homeostasis. ORV's cause greater stress to the environment than foot traffic alone, and ORV operators who attempt to test their vehicles against natural obstacles can do significantly more damage than those who follow legal trails. Illegal use of off-road vehicles has been identified as a serious land management problem ranked with dumping garbage and other forms of vandalism. Many user organizations, such as Tread Lightly! and the Sierra Club, publish and encourage appropriate trail ethics. ORVs have also been criticized for producing more pollution in areas that might normally have none. In addition to noise pollution that can cause hearing impairment and stress in wildlife, according to the U.S. Forest Service, old-style two-stroke engines (no longer a component of new off-road vehicles, although some are still in use) \\"emit about 20 to 33 percent of the consumed fuel through the exhaust\\" and \\"discharge from two-stroke snowmobile engines can lead to indirect pollutant deposition into the top layer of snow and subsequently into the associated surface and ground water.\\" In 2002, the United States Environmental Protection Agency adopted emissions standards for all-terrain vehicles that \\"when fully implemented in 2012... are expected to prevent the release of more than two million tons of air pollution each year‚Äîthe equivalent of removing the pollution from more than 32 million cars every year.\\" Image:Motorcycle-Forest- Damage.jpgNegative environmental effects caused by motorcycles to a portion of the Los Padres National Forest Image:Orv-damage.jpgNegative environmental effects that occurred when off-road vehicle drivers left the posted trail in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park Common off-road vehicles Common commercial off-road vehicles include four-wheel-drive pickup trucks like the Ford F-Series, Chevrolet C/K, Dodge Ram, and Toyota Tacoma. A number of military vehicles have also seen civilian use, including the Jeep CJ and the AM General Hummer. Some, like the early Land Rovers, were adapted to military use from civilian specifications. Specialised commonly available off-road vehicles include ATVs (All Terrain Vehicles), dirt bikes, dune buggies, rock crawlers, and sandrails.

They are used extensively in agriculture, because of their speed and light footprint. An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, or four-wheeler, or RZR is defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a vehicle that travels on low- pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles. Although it is a street- legal vehicle in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states and provinces of Australia, the United States or Canada.. UTV (Utility Vehicle) is very similar to ATV.  Off-road motorcycle  There are various types of off-road motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes, specially designed for off- road events. Compared to road-going motorcycles, off-road machines are simpler and lighter, having long suspension travel, high ground clearance, and rugged construction with little bodywork and no fairings for less damage in spills. Wheels (usually 21\\" front, 18\\" rear) have knobby tires, often clamped to the rim with a rim lock. Commercial, military and less common off-road vehicles European militaries and utilities have used Land Rover Defenders, Haflingers, Pinzgauers, Volvo L3314, and Mercedes-Benz Unimogs for all-terrain transportation. The Portuguese UMM Alter is less common. The military market for off-road vehicles used to be large, but, since the fall of the Iron Curtain in the 1990s, it has dried up to some extent. The U.S. Jeep, developed during World War II, coined the word many people use for any type of light off-road vehicle. In the U.S., the Jeep's successor from the 1980s on was the AM General HMMWV. The Red Army used the GAZ-61 and GAZ-64 during the Second World War. The Eastern Bloc used the GAZ-69 and UAZ-469 in similar roles. SHERP_ATV 4X4. Ultimate ATV with unique capabilities, amphibious.

Justo Jos√© de Urquiza named him 'Business administrator' and sent him to Paraguay on a foreign business mission. He became deputy for C√≥rdoba Province. In 1854 Urquiza named him head of the Ministry of Justice, Education and Public Instruction, where he worked for the six years of Urquiza's mandate, pushing forward the still-emerging nation. He was an active Freemason. After Urquiza's mandate, Derqui became constitutional president. Being from C√≥rdoba and not from Buenos Aires, it was expected that under his rule the continuous revolts of the provincial governments against the federal government would end. Derqui accepted the revised national constitution with the changes that would favour Buenos Aires, and named the country Rep√∫blica Argentina. This and other unpopular policies towards the rest of the country provoked a general discontent in the provinces that led to the Battle of Pav√≥n. Unable to maintain authority, Derqui resigned and fled to Montevideo. While in exile, Bartolom√© Mitre helped him to go back to his wife's native city of Corrientes, where he would die a few years later.

He also wrote the lyrics of the Argentine National Anthem adopted on May 11, 1813.  Early life  L√≥pez began his primary studies in the San Francisco School, and later studied in the Real Colegio San Carlos, today the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. He obtained a doctorate of laws in the University of Chuquisaca. He served as a captain in the Patriotic Regiment during the English invasions. After the Argentine victory he composed a poem entitled El triunfo argentino (The Argentine Triumph).  Political life  He participated in the Cabildo Abierto of May 22, 1810 and supported the formation of the Primera Junta. He had good relations with Manuel Belgrano. When the royalist members of the city government of Buenos Aires were expelled, he was elected mayor of the city; he was an enemy of the party of Cornelio Saavedra and one of the creators of the First Triumvirate, of which he was the Treasurer. Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.The list includes Juan Bautista Alberdi, Manuel Alberti, Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, Miguel de Azcu√©naga, Antonio Gonz√°lez de Balcarce, Manuel Belgrano, Antonio Luis Beruti, Juan Jos√© Castelli, Domingo French, Gregorio Ar√°oz de Lamadrid, Francisco Narciso de Laprida , Juan Larrea, Juan Lavalle, Vicente L√≥pez y Planes, Bartolom√© Mitre, Mariano Moreno, Juan Jos√© Paso, Carlos Pellegrini, Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. Jos√© de San Mart√≠n is known to have been a member of the Lautaro Lodge; but whether the lodge was truly masonic has been debated: L√≥pez was a member of the Constituent Assembly of year XIII, representing Buenos Aires. At the request of the Assembly, he wrote the lyrics to a \\"patriotic march\\", which eventually became the Argentine National Anthem. It was a military march, whose music was composed by the Catalan Blas Parera; it was approved on March 11, 1813. The first public reading was at a tertulia on May 7 in the house of Mariquita S√°nchez de Thompson. It displaced a different march, written by Esteban de Luca, which would have been the anthem if not for the more militaristic Lopez. L√≥pez participated in the government of Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, and with his fall he was sent to prison. He held a few more public offices, and was then named Secretary of the Constituent Congress of 1825, and, a little later, minister for the president Bernardino Rivadavia. After the scandal of negotiations with the Brazilian Empire, Rivadavia resigned the presidency. In his place, L√≥pez was elected as caretaker, signing the dissolution of the Congress and calling elections in Buenos Aires. The new governor, Manuel Dorrego took charge of the ministry; this unified the federalists. When Dorrego fell from grace and was executed by firing squad by Juan Lavalle, Lopez was exiled to Uruguay.  Late years  He returned in 1830 as a member of the Tribunal of Justice for Juan Manuel de Rosas. He was president of the Tribunal for many years and, among other things, presided over the judgement of the assassins of Juan Facundo Quiroga. He was president of the literary salon led by Marcos Sastre, but was not part of the group known as the Generation of '37, to which belonged his two sons, Vicente Fidel L√≥pez and Lucio Vicente L√≥pez.

It is commonly invoked pejoratively, with the implication that the people who claim to support the rights of the working class are themselves members of the ruling classes and are therefore out of touch with the real needs of the people they claim to support and protect. Because the label is a rhetorical device, it carries flexible meaning depending on the circumstances in which it is used. The concept arose in the United States, but has spread to other English-speaking countries, where the term metropolitan elite is more common because liberal can have the opposite meaning, depending on country.  In Canada  Canadian news outlet CBC reported on an event for supporters of Doug Ford (the premier of Ontario). A supporter described elites as \\"Those that think they're better than me\\". Doug Ford also described elites as \\"people who look down on the average, common folk, thinking they‚Äôre smarter and that they know better to tell us how to live our lives\\". Alex Marland of the Memorial University of Newfoundland commented on Justin Trudeau's popularity with \\"liberal elites in metropolitan cities\\" in an article published on Researchgate entitled \\"The brand image of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in international context\\".  In China  Leftard () is appearing in Hong Kong media and the virtual community starting in the 2010s, as a political term. It often refers to unrealistic leftists or left-wing activists who are idealistic, as distinguished from traditional CCP loyalists. They advocate peace, rationality, nonviolence and non-profanity (referred to as \\"\\"). Some critics say that the people they call \\"leftard\\" are too idealistic and have unrealistic ideals, sometimes giving up social justice in the pursuit of equality, love, and peace movement.  In India  In India, the term 'liberal elite' is used to describe the English speaking, left-leaning establishment, aligned to Nehruvian socialism and Marxism, who have formed much of the mainstream intelligentsia and the ruling political class of India, since its independence in 1947. Indian National Congress, often referred to as the 'Grand Old Party' of India, is a left- liberal party, which has dominated the Indian politics for much of its independent history.  In Ireland  A similar concept exists in Irish politics in the form of the \\"Dublin 4 accent\\" and worldview (an area code in the affluent south of Dublin). The reference to this manner of speech highlights a difference between the metropolitan elite and the ordinary people (whether urban working-class or rural \\"culchie\\").

Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, commented that Thornberry's tweet furthers the perception that the Labour Party \\"has been hijacked by the north London liberal elite\\". Furthermore, the term 'Hampstead Socialist' is often used synonymously, referring to the North London area of Hampstead, despite the fact that the Conservatives represent all the constituent wards of the area. However, the wider constituency of Hampstead and Kilburn has often elected Labour MPs, including the 2015 incumbent, and the seats in Hampstead Town ward have previously been won by the Liberal Democrats, making the similar term Hampstead liberal somewhat more accurate as a description. The term was also regularly used by Nick Griffin, the former leader of the British National Party and the phrase \\"North London metropolitan liberal elite\\" has been used by Home Secretary Priti Patel. Due to the high Jewish population of this area, references to \\"North London\\" elites have been accused by some, such as the Jewish Labour Movement, as a form of coded antisemitism. Toby Young of The Spectator made a similar claim of metropolitan elitism regarding Gordon Brown over the Bigotgate affair. On the campaign trail for the 2010 United Kingdom general election, the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown had a conversation with a voter who expressed concern about immigration, before describing her as \\"bigoted\\" whilst being driven away in a car with a microphone still transmitting. Toby Young also used the expression whilst writing in the Daily Mail to refer to Sacha Baron-Cohen, a comedian whose alter egos Borat and Br√ºno have focused on Deep South residents.  In the United States  In the United States, the apocryphal lifestyle of the liberal elite is often referenced in popular culture. Columnist Dave Barry drew attention to these stereotypes when he commented, \\"Do we truly believe that ALL red-state residents are ignorant racist fascist knuckle-dragging NASCAR- obsessed cousin-marrying roadkill-eating tobacco-juice-dribbling gun-fondling religious fanatic rednecks; or that ALL blue-state residents are godless unpatriotic pierced-nose Volvo-driving France-loving left-wing communist latte-sucking tofu-chomping holistic-wacko neurotic vegan weenie perverts?\\" A 2004 political advertisement from the right-wing organization Club for Growth attacked the Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean by portraying him as part of the liberal elite: \\"Howard Dean should take his tax-hiking, government-expanding, latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New York Times-reading, body-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freak show back to Vermont, where it belongs.\\" Those Americans who equate intellectual pursuits and careers with elitism often point out American intellectuals, most of whom are upper-middle-class not upper-class,Thompson, W. & Hickey, J.

At Ivy League universities, an even larger majority, 87% of professors identified themselves as liberals. People with post-graduate degrees are increasingly Democratic. In Thomas Frank's 2004 book What's the Matter with Kansas?, the idea of a liberal elite is compared to George Orwell's character Emmanuel Goldstein in the book Nineteen Eighty-Four, the fictional hated enemy of the people. Frank argues that anger directed towards this perceived enemy is what keeps the conservative coalition together.Thomas Frank, What's the Matter with Kansas?, Henry Holt & Company, During the 2008 presidential election, Republican candidate John McCain likened Democratic candidate Barack Obama's celebrity appeal to that of pop star Britney Spears and socialite Paris Hilton.

A professor of biochemistry and microbiology at Rutgers University for four decades, he discovered a number of antibiotics (and introduced the modern sense of that word to name them), and he introduced procedures that have led to the development of many others. The proceeds earned from the licensing of his patents funded a foundation for microbiological research, which established the Waksman Institute of Microbiology located on Rutgers University's Busch Campus in Piscataway, New Jersey (USA). In 1952, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for \\"ingenious, systematic and successful studies of the soil microbes that led to the discovery of streptomycin.\\" Waksman and his foundation later were sued by Albert Schatz, one of his PhD students and first discoverer of streptomycin, for minimizing Schatz's role in the discovery of streptomycin. In 2005, Selman Waksman was granted an ACS National Historical Chemical Landmark in recognition of the significant work of his lab in isolating more than 15 antibiotics, including streptomycin, which was the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. Biography Selman Waksman was born on July 22, 1888, to Jewish parents, in Nova Pryluka, ÔøºÔøºKiev Governorate, Russian Empire, now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. He was the son of Fradia (London) and Jacob Waksman. He immigrated to the United States in 1910, shortly after receiving his diploma from the Fifth Gymnasium in Odessa, and became a naturalized American citizen six years later. Waksman attended Rutgers College (now Rutgers University), where he graduated in 1915 with a bachelor of science in agriculture. He continued his studies at Rutgers, receiving a master of science the following year. During his graduate study, he worked under J. G. Lipman at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers performing research in soil bacteriology. Waksman spent some months in 1915-1916 at the. United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, DC under Dr Charles Thom, studying soil fungi. He was then appointed as a research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was awarded his doctor of philosophy in biochemistry in 1918. Later he joined the faculty at Rutgers University in the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology. At Rutgers, Waksman's team discovered several antibiotics, including actinomycin, clavacin, streptothricin, streptomycin, grisein, neomycin, fradicin, candicidin, candidin. Two of these, streptomycin and neomycin, have found extensive application in the treatment of infectious disease. Streptomycin was the first antibiotic that could be used to cure the disease tuberculosis. Waksman is credited with coining the term antibiotics, to describe antibacterials derived from other living organisms, for example penicillin, though the term was used by the French dermatologist Fran√ßois Henri Hallopeau, in 1871 to describe a substance opposed to the development of life. In addition to his task at Rutgers, Waksman organized a division of Marine Bacteriology at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1931. He was appointed as a marine bacteriologist there and served until 1942. He was elected a trustee at WHOI and finally a Life Trustee. Waksman acquired many awards and honours, including the Nobel Prize in 1952; the Star of the Rising Sun allotted on him by the emperor of Japan, and the rank of Commandeur in the French L√©gion d'honneur.[ Selman Waksman died on August 16, 1973, at a Hyannis, Mass. Hospital and was interred at the Woods Hole Village Cemetery in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. His tombstone is inscribed \\"Selman Abraham Waksman: Scientist\\", with his dates of birth and death, and the term \\"The earth will unlock and fetch ahead salvation\\" in Hebrew and English, from .This verse differs from the King James Version, \\"Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.\\" Other tributes of Selman Waksman involve antifouling paints for the Navy, the use of enzymes in laundry detergents, and the practice of Concord grape rootstock tosafeguardt French vineyard from fungal infections. Streptomycin Waksman had been studying the Streptomyces family of organism since his college student days and had, for a time, been studying the organism Streptomyces griseus. Streptomycin was isolated from S. griseus and found effective against tuberculosis by one of Waksman's graduate students, Albert Schatz. Controversy The details and credit for the discovery of streptomycin and its usefulness as an antibiotic were strongly contested by Schatz, eventually leading to litigation. Waksman and Rutgers settled out of court with Schatz, resulting in financial remuneration and entitlement to \\"legal and scientific credit as co-discoverer of streptomycin.\\" Systematic experiments to test several strains of antibiotics against several different disease organisms were under way in Waksman's laboratory at the time. Their classic approach was to explore a complete matrix with rows consisting of antibiotics and columns consisting of different diseases. The bacteria which produced the antibiotic streptomycin were discovered by Schatz in the farmland outside his lab, and tested by him. Waksman, however, eventually came to claim sole credit for the discovery. See also: Streptomycin Controversy Neomycin Neomycin is derived from actinomycetes and was discovered by Waksman and Hubert A. Lechevalier, one of Waksman's graduate students. The discovery was published in the journal Science. Nobel Prize Waksman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1952. In the award speech, Waksman was called \\"one of the greatest benefactors to mankind,\\" as the result of the discovery of streptomycin. Schatz protested being left out of the award, but the Nobel committee ruled that he was a mere lab assistant working under an eminent scientist. In 1951, using half of his personal patent royalties, Waksman created the Waksman Foundation for Microbiology. At a meeting of the board of trustees of the foundation, held in July 1951, he urged the building of a facility for work in microbiology, named the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, which is located on the Busch Campus of Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. First president of the foundation, Waksman was succeeded in this position by his son, Byron H. Waksman, from 1970 to 2000. The Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology of the National Academy of Sciences is given in his honor.

Ooghekuhno' in Koyukon, Kuuyukaq in I√±upiaq) is a tributary of the Yukon River, in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is the last major tributary entering the Yukon before the larger river empties into the Bering Sea. Rising at the confluence of the North Fork Koyukuk River with the Middle Fork Koyukuk River, it flows generally southwest to meet the larger Yukon River at Koyukuk. The river, with headwaters above the Arctic Circle in the Endicott Mountains of the Brooks Range, drains an area north of the Yukon River that includes part of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, as well as Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge. The main stem of the river is lined by the communities of Evansville, Bettles, Alatna, Allakaket, Hughes, and Huslia before reaching Koyukuk. Its headwaters tributaries include the Koyukuk's south, middle, and north forks, the Alatna River, and the John River.Benke and Cushing, pp. 789-90 Major tributaries further downstream include the Kanuti, Batzu, Hogatza, Huslia, Dulbi, Kateel, and Gisasa rivers. Of these, the Alatna, John, and North Fork are National Wild and Scenic Rivers, as is the Tinayguk River, a tributary of the North Fork.Benke and Cushing, p. 791 Name Koyukuk was derived from the Central Yup'ik phrase kuik-yuk, meaning a river. The Koyukuk River was given this generic C. Yup'ik name by Russian explorer Petr Vasilii Malakhov, because he did not know the local Koyukon name for it (i.e., Ooghekuhno)., at page 146 (\\"Malakhov ‚Ä¶ did not know the native name for this, and so he called it simply Kuyukuk, the word for 'river' in the coastal speech of the Chnagmyut.\\"). The \\"Chnagmyut\\" lived between St. Michael and Unalakleet. Id. at page 104 (map).See, , at pp. 210 (kuik = river), 598 (-yuk = suffix, thing like). The Western Union Telegraph Expedition used the spelling of Coyukuk before the United States Board on Geographic Names settled on Koyukuk.  History  The Russian Petr Vasilii Malakhov reached the river at its confluence with the Yukon in 1838. The United States acquired Alaska after the American Civil War, but it was 1885 before US representatives Lieutenant Henry Allen and Private Fred Fickett of the United States Army ascended and explored the river. The discovery of gold deposits by Johnnie Folger on the Middle Fork in 1893 on The Tramway bar led to a gold rush in 1898; trading posts and mining camps, including Bettles, were rapidly developed on the upper river. In 1929, Robert \\"Bob\\" Marshall explored the North Fork of the Koyukuk River, and identified what he called the Gates of the Arctic. In 1980 the United States Congress designated 100 mi (164 km) of the North Fork of the Koyukuk River in the Brooks Range as the Koyukuk Wild and Scenic River, which authorized certain levels of protection for the habitat. In 1994 the river flooded, sweeping away three villages, forcing the wholesale relocation of the population. Flora and fauna Lower course of the Koyukuk in winter Zane Hills and Koyukuk River Vegetation along the Koyukuk River, sparse along the upper reaches, consists of tundra plants such as dwarf willows and other shrubs, sedges, and lichens. Further downstream at lower elevations, taiga and boreal forest plants are common except in the Koyukuk Flats near the mouth, where sedges and other herbaceous plants dominate the poorly drained muskeg. Trees found in more well-drained areas along the river include mountain alder, trembling aspen, white, and black spruce.Benke and Cushing, p. 790 Fish species frequenting the lower Koyukuk include Arctic lamprey and sockeye salmon. The sockeye and other salmon species, including Chinook and chum, also thrive along the upper reaches and tributaries. Caribou migrate across the upper part of the Koyukuk watershed. Other major vertebrates in the region include bald eagles, brown and black bears, mink, beaver, marten, and river otter. Beluga whales sometimes visit the lower Koyukuk. Moose herds, which thrive in parts of the watershed, especially in riparian zones downstream of Hughes, attract local and non-local hunters, bears, and wolves. A consortium of moose hunters and state wildlife officials work to keep the moose population at sustainable levels. Through 2005, no one had published a study of invertebrates of the Koyukuk or its larger tributaries. General information included in a study related to pipeline construction through the watershed suggested the presence of a variety of true flies, midges, black flies, mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies.

A person with such a sexual preference is a gerontophile. The word gerontophilia was coined in 1901 by psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing. It derives from Greek: geron, meaning \\"old person\\" and philie, meaning \\"love\\". Gerontophilia is classified as a paraphilia, but is not mentioned in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases. The prevalence of gerontophilia is unknown. A study of pornographic search terms on a peer-to-peer network reported that 0.15% had gerontophilic themes. Sex offenders with elderly victims do not necessarily have gerontophilia. There are other possible motivations for these offenses, such as rage or sadism, or the increased vulnerability of elderly as a social group, which are factors that may not involve a sexual preference for the elderly. There are no studies showing that most such offenders are gerontophiles. In one small study, two of six sex offenders against the elderly evinced gerontophilic tendencies. Gerontophilia can also be expressed with consenting elderly partners in a legal context. Research on gerontophilia is limited to a small number of case studies, beginning with a paper by French physician Charles F√©r√© in 1905.

Tropical gardens are no longer exclusive to tropical areas. Many gardeners in cooler climates are adopting the tropical garden design, which is possible through careful choice of plants and flowers. Main features include plants with very large leaves, vegetation that builds in height towards the back of the garden, creating a dense garden. Large plants and small trees hang over the garden, leaving sunlight to hit the ground directly. Tropical plants The following are some examples of tropical plants to be used in tropical gardens or as indoor plants. Hoyas Hoyas are known as the ‚ÄúWax Flowers‚Äù due to their texture and almost unreal appearance. They need relatively warm and humid conditions, but depending on the specific variety of Hoya, they can endure heavy rainfall for some months during the wet seasons just as they may also be exposed to long dry periods. They are commonly used indoors. They need indirect light, but the amount or required light depends on the variety. They need small amounts of water and the soil is to be kept slightly dry since a very wet soil can end up killing this kind of plant. They can be grown in pots that are not too big or in hanging baskets. They grow better if kept at a minimum temperature of 15 degree Celsius (59 Fahrenheit). Banana plants Contrary to common belief, growing banana trees is not that difficult and allow people to enjoy their own bananas. Also these plants can be used as windbreaks. They need fertile soils, large mulch and organic matter, large amounts of nitrogen and potassium, warm temperature, high humidity, large amounts of water, and shelter from other banana plants. Banana plants are not to be exposed to strong winds and extreme weather conditions (too hot or too cold weather) with an ideal temperature being 26-30 degree Celsius (78-86 Fahrenheit). They stop growing below 14 degree Celsius (57 Fahrenheit). Banana rhizomes are planted upright and their roots have to be well covered with soil. Bird of paradise Among the many species of birds of paradise is the Strelitzia reginae, an indigenous plant to South Africa and South America. As a tropical plant, it grows in warm, humid climates. This exotic, colorful plant, with evergreen leaves resembles a bird's beak. It is an outdoor plant provided the weather is not too cold. Otherwise, it is better to keep it in a pot indoors. It needs rich soil as well as sun or partial shade. Another requirement for this plant is a good drainage. Ferns Ferns are commonly used to give gardens a great foliage. Most ferns are easy to take care of. They basically cannot be exposed to direct sunlight for long periods of time. Moreover, their soil should always be moist. One way to keep ferns moist is by misting them. Papaya tree Papaya trees should be planted where they can be kept warm and free from wind and freeze. They need enough water to support their leaves, but it should not be exceed as to a root rod. They also need a well-drained soil. Orchids Night temperatures between 12- 18 degree Celsius (55-65 Fahrenheit), and day temperatures between 23-26 degree Celsius (75-80 Fahrenheit) are fine temperatures for orchids. Orchids need sufficient amounts of light as well as humidity. However, there are many varieties of orchids and each of them features specific care needs. Maintenance A tropical garden is one of the most difficult gardens to build or maintain, it becomes more difficult the more your local climate differs from the natural habitat of your plants. The keys to a healthy tropical garden are plentiful light and water. The large leaves that feature in tropical plants require the soil to be humid at all times, so irrigation might be a must-have for some gardens. Over-watering causes the roots to rot, killing plants. A tropical plant that is not cold-hardy should be brought indoors during the winter and returned to the garden for the summer. Non- tropical climates A greenhouse is a good way to grow tropical plants in a colder climate. Tropical plants that work well in non-tropical climates include; * Acanthus mollis * Canna * Crocosmia, aka L * Hedera algeriensis * Paulownia tomentosa * Trachycarpus * Rhapidophyllum * Jubaea * Sabal minor and Sabal palmetto Gallery Image:Gatorpl.jpgGator Pride Hibiscus Image:Double hibiscus.jpgDouble Hibiscus Image:Canna AugusteFerrier 1679.jpgCanna 'Auguste Ferrier' Attractions Many attractions feature tropical gardens, including: * Alma Park Zoo, Kuranda, Queensland, Australia * Kuranda Scenic Railway, Dakabin, Queensland * Colasanti's Tropical Gardens, Kingsville, Ontario, Canada * Flor og Fj√¶re, Stavanger, Norway * Cedarvale Botanic Garden and Restaurant, Davis, Oklahoma, USA * Reiman Gardens, Ames, Iowa See also * List of garden types References Types of garden ","title":"Tropical garden"},{"id":"718112","text":"Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (7 March 1802 ‚Äì 1 October 1873) was an English painter and sculptor, well known for his paintings of animals ‚Äì particularly horses, dogs, and stags. However, his best-known works are the lion sculptures at the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. Life Landseer 1873 Landseer was born in London, the son of the engraver John Landseer A.R.A. He was something of a prodigy whose artistic talents were recognised early on. He studied under several artists, including his father, and the history painter Benjamin Robert Haydon, who encouraged the young Landseer to perform dissections in order to fully understand animal musculature and skeletal structure. Landseer's life was entwined with the Royal Academy. At the age of just 13, in 1815, he exhibited works there. He was elected an Associate at the age of 24, and an Academician five years later in 1831. In 1823 Landseer was commissioned to paint a portrait of Georgiana Russell, Duchess of Bedford. Despite her being twenty years older than he was, they began an affair. He was knighted in 1850, and although elected to be president of the Royal Academy in 1866 he declined the invitation. In his late thirties Landseer suffered what is now believed to be a substantial nervous breakdown, and for the rest of his life was troubled by recurring bouts of melancholy, hypochondria, and depression, often aggravated by alcohol and drug use.Ormond, Monarch 125 In the last few years of his life Landseer's mental stability was problematic, and at the request of his family he was declared insane in July 1872. Painting Edwin Henry Landseer self-portrait Landseer was a notable figure in 19th-century British art, and his works can be found in Tate Britain, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Kenwood House and the Wallace Collection in London. He also collaborated with fellow painter Frederick Richard Lee. Landseer's popularity in Victorian Britain was considerable, and his reputation as an animal painter was unrivalled. Much of his fame ‚Äì and his income ‚Äì was generated by the publication of engravings of his work, many of them by his brother Thomas.Stephens (1880), p. 4. Princess Charlotte for her lady-in-waiting, Lady Barbara Ponsonby Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller (1820) One of his earliest paintings is credited as the origin of the myth that St. Bernard rescue dogs in the Alps carry a small casket of brandy on their collars. Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller (1820) shows two of the dogs standing over a man who is partially buried in snow. One is barking to attract attention while the other, who is depicted with the miniature barrel, attempts to revive the man by licking his hand. His appeal crossed class boundaries: reproductions of his works were common in middle-class homes, while he was also popular with the aristocracy. Queen Victoria commissioned numerous pictures from the artist. Initially asked to paint various royal pets, he then moved on to portraits of ghillies and gamekeepers. Then, in the year before her marriage, the queen commissioned a portrait of herself, as a present for Prince Albert.Manson (1902), p. 102. He taught both Victoria and Albert to etch,Manson (1902), p. 104. and made portraits of Victoria's children as babies, usually in the company of a dog.Manson (1902), p. 105. He also made two portraits of Victoria and Albert dressed for costume balls, at which he was a guest himself.Manson (1902), p. 106. One of his last paintings was a life-size equestrian portrait of the Queen, shown at the Royal Academy in 1873, made from earlier sketches.Manson (1902), p. 107. The Monarch of the Glen, 1851: the image was widely distributed in steel engravings. Now in the Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh. Landseer was particularly associated with Scotland, which he had first visited in 1824 and the Highlands in particular, which provided the subjects (both human and animal) for many of his important paintings. The paintings included his early successes The Hunting of Chevy Chase (1825‚Äì26), An Illicit Whisky Still in the Highlands (1826‚Äì1829) and his more mature achievements, such as the majestic stag study The Monarch of the Glen (1851) and Rent Day in the Wilderness (1855‚Äì1868). In 1828, he was commissioned to produce illustrations for the Waverley Edition of Sir Walter Scott's novels. So popular and influential were Landseer's paintings of dogs in the service of humanity that the name Landseer came to be the official name for the variety of Newfoundland dog that, rather than being black or mostly black, features a mix of both black and white. It was this variety Landseer popularised in his paintings celebrating Newfoundlands as water rescue dogs, most notably Off to the Rescue (1827), A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society (1838), and Saved (1856). The paintings combine the Victorian conception of childhood with the appealing idea of noble animals devoted to humankind, a devotion indicated, in Saved, by the fact the dog has rescued the child without any apparent human involvement. Landseer's painting Laying Down The Law (1840) satirises the legal profession through anthropomorphism. It shows a group of dogs, with a poodle symbolising the Lord Chancellor.Manson (1902), p. 101. The Shrew Tamed was entered at the 1861 Royal Academy Exhibition and caused controversy because of its subject matter. It showed a powerful horse on its knees among straw in a stable, while a lovely young woman lies with her head pillowed on its flanks, lightly touching its head with her hand. The catalogue explained it as a portrait of a noted equestrienne, Ann Gilbert, applying the taming techniques of the famous 'horse whisperer' John Solomon Rarey.The Times, Saturday, 4 May 1861; pg. 12; Issue 23924; col A Critics were troubled by the depiction of a languorous woman dominating a powerful animal and some concluded Landseer was implying the famous courtesan Catherine Walters, then at the height of her fame.Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Vol. 90 (550) Aug 1861 Page 211 Walters was an excellent horsewoman and along with other \\"pretty horsebreakers\\", frequently appeared riding in Hyde Park. Some of Landseer's later works, such as his Flood in the Highlands and Man Proposes, God Disposes (both of 1864) are pessimistic in tone. The latter shows two polar bears toying with the bones of the dead and other remains, from Sir John Franklin's failed Arctic expedition.Manson (1902), p. 161. The painting was purchased at auction by Thomas Holloway and hangs in the picture gallery of Royal Holloway, University of London. It is a college tradition to cover the painting with a union jack, when exams are held in the gallery, as there is a longstanding rumour that the painting drives people mad when they sit near it. In 1862 Landseer painted a portrait of Louisa Caroline Stewart-Mackenzie holding her daughter Maysie.Sherwood, Dolly, Harriet Hosmer: American Sculptor 1830‚Äì1908, University of Missouri Press, Columbia, 1991 p. 266. Sculpture One of four Lions around the base of Nelson's Column Old Shepherd's Chief Mourner (1837; Victoria and Albert Museum, London). In 1858 the government commissioned Landseer to make four bronze lions for the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, following the rejection of a set in stone by Thomas Milnes. Landseer accepted on condition that he would not have to start work for another nine months, and there was a further delay when he asked to be supplied with copies of casts of a real lion he knew were in the possession of the academy at Turin. The request proved complex, and the casts did not arrive until the summer of 1860. The lions were made at the Kensington studio of Carlo Marochetti, who also cast them. Work was slowed by Landseer's ill health, and his fractious relationship with Marochetti. The sculptures were installed in 1867. Death Landseer's death on 1 October 1873 was widely marked in England: shops and houses lowered their blinds, flags flew at half mast, his bronze lions at the base of Nelson's column were hung with wreaths, and large crowds lined the streets to watch his funeral cortege pass.Ormond, Monarch 135 Landseer was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, London. At his death, Landseer left behind three unfinished paintings: Finding the Otter, Nell Gwynne, and The Dead Buck, all on easels in his studio. It was his dying wish that his friend John Everett Millais should complete the paintings, and this he did.J Miscellaneous Landseer was rumoured to be able to paint with both hands at the same time, for example, paint a horse's head with the right and its tail with the left, simultaneously. He was also known to be able to paint extremely quickly‚Äîwhen the mood struck him. He could also procrastinate, sometimes for years, over certain commissions. The architect Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens was named after him and was his godson‚ÄîLutyens' father was a friend of Landseer. Gallery File:Edwin Landseer - Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream.

The mainstem is a coolwater stream as evidenced by the presence of burbot and mottled sculpin, it also contains hornyhead chub, common shiner, johnny darter, and walleye. Several riparian wetlands provide excellent habitat for northern pike. The fish community near the mouth is influenced by its proximity to Lake Michigan, and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are stocked there.

The other three are storge, philia, and agape. Eros refers to \\"passionate love\\" or romance.C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves The term erotic is derived from eros. Eros has also been used in philosophy and psychology in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to \\"life energy\\". In literature The classical Greek tradition In the classical world, erotic love was generally referred to as a kind of madness or theia mania (\\"madness from the gods\\"). This love passion was described through an elaborate metaphoric and mythological schema involving \\"love's arrows\\" or \\"love darts\\", the source of which was often the personified figure of Eros (or his Latin counterpart, Cupid),See, for example, the Amores and the Heroides of Ovid which frequently refer to the overwhelming passion caused by Cupid's darts. or another deity (such as Rumor).See Paris's letter to Helen of Troy, in Ovid, Heroides and Amores, XVI, 36-38. At times the source of the arrows was said to be the image of the beautiful love object itself. If these arrows were to arrive at the lover's eyes, they would then travel to and 'pierce' or 'wound' his or her heart and overwhelm him/her with desire and longing (lovesickness). The image of the \\"arrow's wound\\" was sometimes used to create oxymorons and rhetorical antithesis concerning its pleasure and pain. \\"Love at first sight\\" was explained as a sudden and immediate beguiling of the lover through the action of these processes, but this was not the only mode of entering into passionate love in classical texts. At times the passion could occur after the initial meeting; for example, in Phaedra's letter to Hippolytus in Ovid's Heroides: \\"That time I went to Eleusis... it was then most of all (though you had pleased me before) that piercing love lodged in my deepest bones.\\"Ovid, Heroides and Amores, translated by Grant Showerman. Second edition revised by G.P. Goold. Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), IV, 67-70, p 49. At times, the passion could even precede the first glimpse, as in Paris' letter to Helen of Troy in the same work, where Paris says that his love for Helen came upon him before he had set eyes on her: \\"...you were my heart's desire before you were known to me. I beheld your features with my soul ere I saw them with my eyes; rumour, that told me of you, was the first to deal my wound.\\"Ovid, Heroides and Amores, translated by Grant Showerman, second edition revised by G.P. Goold (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), XVI, 36-38, pp. 199-201. Whether by \\"first sight\\" or by other routes, passionate love often had disastrous results according to the classical authors. In the event that the loved one was cruel or uninterested, this desire was shown to drive the lover into a state of depression, causing lamentation and illness. Occasionally, the loved one was depicted as an unwitting ensnarer of the lover, because of her sublime beauty‚Äîa \\"divine curse\\" which inspires men to kidnap her or try to rape her.For more on these tropes in the Ancient Greek novel, see Fran√ßoise L√©toublon, Les Lieux communs du roman: St√©r√©otypes grecs d'aventure et d'amour, Leiden: E.J.Brill, 1993. . Stories in which unwitting men catch sight of the naked body of Artemis the huntress (and sometimes Aphrodite) lead to similar ravages (as in the tale of Actaeon). There are few written records of women's lives and loves in ancient Greece. Nevertheless, some historians have suggested that women may have been the objects of love more often than was previously believed and that men's love for women may have been an ideal, although not one realized much in fact.R.J. Sternberg, Cupid's Arrow, 63 In ancient Athens the dominance of man in the marital relationship is expressed by figures such as the prominent Greek statesman and general Alcibiades.Plutarch, Alcibiades, 8 Another famous relationship between a man and a woman in ancient Athens was the romantic involvement of Aspasia with the statesman Pericles.S. Monoson, Plato's Democratic Entanglements, 195M. Ostwald, Athens as a Cultural Center, 310 In Sparta, the social status of women was stronger and the marital rituals were solemnized. There was an elaborate preparation for the first night after the marriage, while the man in a symbolic rite had to abduct his future wife before the official ceremony, while she had her hair cut short and dressed in boy's clothes.P. Cartledge, The Spartans, 234 The ideal outcome of marital eros in Sparta was the birth of a healthy boy.P. Cartledge, The Spartans, 235 In The Symposium by Plato, Aristophanes relays a myth of the origin of both heterosexual and homosexual love. Eros paidikos, or pedagogic pederasty, was apparently known since 200 years before Plato. Originally, according to Aristophanes, each human being had two heads, four arms, and four legs, before Zeus decided to split every person in two. After everyone was split, each half searched for their other half, to make themselves whole again. Some people were originally half-male and half-female, and when Zeus split them they became men and women who sought opposite-sex partners. Some people were originally all-female, and they split into females who sought female partners. Some were all-male, and they split into males who sought other males. Plato The ancient Greek philosopher Plato developed an idealistic concept of eros which would prove to be very influential in modern times. In general, Plato did not consider physical attraction to be a necessary part of eros. According to Plato, eros could be diverted to philosophy (inclusive of mathematical, ethical and ascetical training), rather that dissipated in sexuality, for the purpose of using erotic energy as a vehicle for the transformation of consciousness, and union with the Divine.M.B. Mineo, Diotima of Mantineia, 102 In Symposium, eros is described as a universal force that moves all things towards peace, perfection and divinity.M.B. Mineo, Diotima of Mantineia, 134 Eros himself is a \\"daimon\\", namely a creature between divinity and mortality.Plato, Symposium, 202b-203a \\"Platonic love\\" in this original sense can be attained by the intellectual purification of eros from carnal into ideal form. Plato argues there that eros is initially felt for a person, but with contemplation it can become an appreciation for the beauty within that person, or even an appreciation for beauty itself in an ideal sense. As Plato expresses it, eros can help the soul to \\"remember\\" beauty in its pure form. It follows from this, for Plato, that eros can contribute to an understanding of truth. Eros, understood in this sense, differed considerably from the common meaning of the word in the Greek language of Plato's time. It also differed from the meaning of the word in contemporary literature and poetry. For Plato, eros is neither purely human nor purely divine: it is something intermediate which he calls a daimon. > Its main characteristic is permanent aspiration and desire. Even when it > seems to give, eros continues to be a \\"desire to possess\\", but nevertheless > it is different from a purely sensual love in being the love that tends > towards the sublime. According to Plato, the gods do not love, because they > do not experience desires, inasmuch as their desires are all satisfied. They > can thus only be an object, not a subject of love (Symposium 200-1). For > this reason they do not have a direct relationship with man; it is only the > mediation of eros that allows the connecting of a relationship (Symposium > 203). Eros is thus the way that leads man to divinity, but not vice versa. > [...] Nevertheless, eros remains always, for Plato, an egocentric love: it > tends toward conquering and possessing the object that represents a value > for man. To love the good signifies to desire to possess it forever. Love is > therefore always a desire for immortality.John Paul II, Man and Woman He > Created Them: a theology of the body, translated by Michael Waldstein > (Boston: Pauline Books and Media), 47:1 (p.315), footnote 56. See also > Anders Nygren, Agape and eros, translated by Philip S. Watson (University of > Chicago Press). Paradoxically, for Plato, the object of eros does not have to be physically beautiful. This is because the object of eros is beauty, and the greatest beauty is eternal, whereas physical beauty is in no way eternal. However, if the lover achieves possession of the beloved's inner (i.e., ideal) beauty, his need for happiness will be fulfilled, because happiness is the experience of knowing that you are participating in the ideal.Plato. Symposium. 199c5-212c European literature The Old, Old Story, John William Godward, 1903 The classical conception of love's arrows was developed further by the troubadour poets of Provence during the medieval period, and became part of the European courtly love tradition. The role of a woman's eyes in eliciting erotic desire was particularly emphasized by the Proven√ßal poets, as N. E. Griffin states: > According to this description, love originates upon the eyes of the lady > when encountered by those of her future lover. The love thus generated is > conveyed on bright beams of light from her eyes to his, through which it > passes to take up its abode in his heart.See the introduction by Nathaniel > Edward Griffin to The Filostrato of Giovanni Boccaccio (New York: Bilbo and > Tannen, no date. ), p.76, note 2. In some medieval texts, the gaze of a beautiful woman is compared to the sight of a basilisk‚Äîa legendary reptile said to have the power to cause death with a single glance. These images continued to be circulated and elaborated upon in the literature and iconography of the Renaissance and Baroque periods.For a full discussion of the scene of \\"love at first sight\\" in fiction, see Jean Rousset, \\"Leurs yeux se rencontr√®rent\\" : la sc√®ne de premi√®re vue dans le roman, Paris: Jos√© Corti, 1981. Boccaccio for example, in his Il Filostrato, mixes the tradition of Cupid's arrow with the Proven√ßal emphasis on the eyes as the birthplace of love: \\"Nor did he (Troilus) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart.\\"Giovanni Boccaccio, Il Filostrato, canto 1, strophe 29; translation by Nathaniel Edward Griffin and Arthur Beckwith Myrick, p. 147. According to Griffin: \\"In the description of the enamorment of Troilus is a singular blending of the Proven√ßal conception of the eyes as the birthplace of love with the classical idea of the God of Love with his bows and quiver...\\" (ibid., p.77, note 2). The rhetorical antithesis between the pleasure and pain from love's dart continued through the 17th century, as for example, in these classically inspired images from The Fairy-Queen: > If Love's a Sweet Passion, why does it torment? > If a Bitter, oh tell me whence comes my content? > Since I suffer with pleasure, why should I complain, > Or grieve at my Fate, when I know 'tis in vain? > Yet so pleasing the Pain is, so soft is the Dart, > That at once it both wounds me, and Tickles my Heart.Anonymous, \\"If Love's a > Sweet Passion\\", from the libretto of Henry Purcell's The Fairy-Queen, act 3. Roman Catholic teachings Ancient Jewish tradition, Augustine of Hippo and St Bonaventure all have influence on Roman Catholic marital teachings regarding eros. In his first encyclical, Deus caritas est, Pope Benedict XVI discusses three of the four greek relationship terms: eros, philia and agape, and contrasts between them. In agape, for Benedict, one gives of oneself to another; in eros, the self seeks to receive from another self; philia is the mutual love between friends. He explains that eros and agape are both inherently good, but that eros risks being downgraded to mere sex if it is not balanced by an element of spiritual Christianity. The encyclical argues that eros and agape are not distinct kinds of love, but are separate halves of complete love, unified as both a giving and receiving. Modern psychologists Freud  In Freudian psychology, eros, not to be confused with libido, is not exclusively the sex drive, but our life force, the will to live. It is the desire to create life, and favors productivity and construction. In early psychoanalytic writings, instincts from the eros were opposed by forces from the ego. But in later psychoanalytic theory, eros is opposed by the destructive death instinct of Thanatos (death instinct or death drive). In his 1925 paper \\"The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis\\",Freud, S. (1925). \\"The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis\\", in The Collected Papers of Sigmund Freud, Vol. 5, p.163-74. (Tr. James Strachey.) Freud explains that the psychoanalytic concept of sexual energy is more in line with the Platonic view of eros, as expressed in the Symposium, than with the common use of the word \\"sex\\" as related primarily to genital activity. He also mentions the philosopher Schopenhauer as an influence. He then goes on to confront his adversaries for ignoring such great precursors and for tainting his whole theory of eros with a pansexual tendency. He finally writes that his theory naturally explains this collective misunderstanding as a predictable resistance to the acknowledgement of sexual activity in childhood. However, F. M. Cornford finds the standpoints of Plato and of Freud to be \\"diametrically opposed\\" with regard to eros. In Plato, eros is a spiritual energy initially, which then \\"falls\\" downward; whereas in Freud eros is a physical energy which is \\"sublimated\\" upward.Cornford, F.M. (1950), \\"The Doctrine of Eros in Plato's Symposium\\", in The Unwritten Philosophy. The philosopher and sociologist Herbert Marcuse appropriated the Freudian concept of eros for his highly influential 1955 work Eros and Civilization. Jung In Carl Jung's analytical psychology, the counterpart to eros is logos, a Greek term for the principle of rationality. Jung considers logos to be a masculine principle, while eros is a feminine principle. According to Jung: > Woman's psychology is founded on the principle of Eros, the great binder and > loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is > Logos. The concept of Eros could be expressed in modern terms as psychic > relatedness, and that of Logos as objective interest.Carl Jung, ‚ÄúWoman in > Europe‚Äù (1927), in Collected Works vol. 10, paragraph 255; reprinted in > Aspects of the Feminine, Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, . This gendering of eros and logos is a consequence of Jung's theory of the anima/animus syzygy of the human psyche. Syzygy refers to the split between male and female. According to Jung, this split is recapitulated in the unconscious mind by means of \\"contrasexual\\" (opposite-gendered) elements called the anima (in men) and the animus (in women). Thus men have an unconscious feminine principle, the \\"anima\\", which is characterized by feminine eros. The work of individuation for men involves becoming conscious of the anima and learning to accept it as one's own, which entails accepting eros. This is necessary in order to see beyond the projections that initially blind the conscious ego. \\"Taking back the projections\\" is a major task in the work of individuation, which involves owning and subjectivizing unconscious forces which are initially regarded as alien.For a critical perspective on this viewpoint, which also summarizes the Jungian position well, see James Hillman, The Dream and The Underworld (1979), p.100. In essence, Jung's concept of eros is not dissimilar to the Platonic one. Eros is ultimately the desire for wholeness, and although it may initially take the form of passionate love, it is more truly a desire for \\"psychic relatedness\\", a desire for interconnection and interaction with other sentient beings. However, Jung was inconsistent, and he did sometimes use the word \\"eros\\" as a shorthand to designate sexuality.Robert H. Hopcke, A Guided Tour of the Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Shambhala Books, 1999, p.45ff.

Since 2014, Young has worked in the Rangers‚Äô front office as a Special Assistant to the General Manager (Jon Daniels). Originally a second baseman, the versatile Young was a five-time All-Star at shortstop, once at third base, and once as a combination designated hitter / utility infielder. He was the 2005 American League (AL) batting champion. Young played baseball in high school at Bishop Amat Memorial High School and in college at University of California, Santa Barbara (UC-Santa Barbara). He was originally drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in 1994, but elected to return to college and was eventually drafted in 1997 by the Toronto Blue Jays. After spending several seasons in the minor leagues with the Blue Jays, Young was traded to the Rangers, where he spent over a decade. While with the Rangers, Young set several club records in offensive statistical categories, including runs scored and total bases. In 2016, Young was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. In 2019, Young's No. 10 was retired by the Rangers. Early life Young attended Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California, followed by the University of California, Santa Barbara, to which he later donated money to refurbish the school's baseball field. Young was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 25th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft but did not sign. Three years later the Toronto Blue Jays selected him in the fifth round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. Young signed with the Blue Jays, who traded him in 2000 with pitcher Darwin Cubill√°n to the Rangers for Esteban Loaiza while Young was still in their minor league system. Professional career Minor leagues (1997‚Äì2000) Young made his professional debut in 1997 with the St. Catharines Blue Jays in the New York‚ÄìPenn League (NY-Penn) (short-season A). Among his achievements in the NY-Penn League were a 16-game hitting streak, tying for fifth in the league with 48 RBIs, and tying for third in the league with 136 total bases. In 1998, he spent the season with the Hagerstown Suns of the South Atlantic League. Playing second base, he led all players at his position in fielding percentage. 1999 would be an all-star season for Young. Playing for the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League, he earned spots on both the midseason and postseason all star teams by leading the league in doubles and finishing fourth in batting average and hits, .313 and 155 respectively. After the regular season, he played for the Rancho Cucamonga Surfers in the California Fall League. He split 2000 between Double-A and Triple-A and, on July 19, was traded to the Rangers with Darwin Cubill√°n for Esteban Loaiza. The Rangers purchased his contract on September 27 and he played the final five games of the season in the majors making his debut as a pinch runner. Though he began 2001 in Triple-A, he was recalled to the majors on May 25 and did not return to the minors at all during the season. Texas Rangers (2000‚Äì2012) Young reached the Majors briefly in 2000, playing 2nd and getting two at-bats. He hit .249 in 106 games as a second baseman in 2001. In 2002, Young placed second in fielding among second basemen with a .988 fielding percentage. In 2003, Young was 3rd in the league in hits with 204, and led all second baseman with a batting average of .306. Young had a fielding percentage of .987. Michael Young on April 25, 2009 After signing a new contract, Young moved to shortstop, filling the hole left by the departure of regular Ranger's shortstop Alex Rodriguez in 2004, to make room for newly acquired second baseman Alfonso Soriano. He was second in the American League in hits with 216 and at bats with 690, fourth in runs with 114, and ninth in batting with an average of .313. He spent 89 games hitting in the leadoff spot, the last time in his career that he hit leadoff prior to 2013. Young won the AL batting title in 2005 with an average of .331, and was first in MLB in hits with 221. He was second in AL in at bats with 668, and his 114 runs were fifth-best in the AL. Young also established a career-high in home runs with 24. Young's 91 RBIs placed him second among all shortstops in the AL. On February 14, 2006, Young and Rangers teammate Mark Teixeira were selected to the United States roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic. At the conclusion of the 2006 MLB All-Star Game held at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Young was awarded the Major League Baseball All-Star Game MVP Award after hitting a game-winning two-run triple in the ninth inning. Young led the American League in fielding percentage at shortstop with .981. Young also played all 162 games of the 2006 season, had 217 hits and topped 100 RBI for the first time in his career. In March 2007, Young agreed to an $80 million contract extension that would have kept him with the Rangers until 2013. Young finished the 2007 season with a batting average of .315, which led the Rangers and was 11th- highest in the AL. Young also led the Rangers with 94 RBIs and was second among all shortstops in the AL. Young was second on the team and tied a career high in stolen bases with 13. Young's 201 hits were 4th in the AL, and marked the 5th consecutive 200-hit season, joining Ichiro Suzuki and Wade Boggs as the only players to do so since 1940 and just the second middle infielder, along with Charlie Gehringer, to have accomplished that feat. Young played in the longest All-Star game in history. He drove in the game-winning RBI at the 2008 MLB All-Star Game after four hours and 40 minutes of playing time. Also, in 2008 Young won the Gold Glove at shortstop for the American League. In 2009, Young moved to third base to make room for shortstop prospect Elvis Andrus. The Rangers did not consult Young on this, and he requested a trade. He subsequently rescinded the request. On April 19, 2009, Young hit his first career walk-off home run, off Royals pitcher Kyle Farnsworth. Young was voted on the AL 2009 All Star team by the players. On June 16, 2010, Young hit a ground ball up the middle to collect his 1,748th career hit, and pass Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez to become the Rangers' career leader in hits. On defense, in 2010 he tied for the AL lead in errors by a third baseman, with 19, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them, at .950. During the 2010‚Äì11 offseason, Young said that the Rangers had \\"misled and manipulated\\" him and requested a trade. The Rangers, having acquired free agent third baseman Adri√°n Beltr√©, planned to have Young be the team's primary designated hitter as well as a utility infielder, and see time at first base for the first time in his career. He was a 2011 American League All Star. On August 7, 2011, Young hit an infield single against Josh Tomlin of the Cleveland Indians for his 2,000th career hit. In 2011, Young batted .338 (3rd in the American League) with 11 home runs, primarily splitting his time between DH (69 games), third base (40 games), and first base (36 games). He tied with Adri√°n Gonz√°lez for the AL lead in hits (213), and was 5th in RBIs (106) and sacrifice flies (9), 8th in on-base percentage (.380), and 10th in doubles (41). After Young struggled in the 2012 season, the Rangers asked Young if he desired a trade, as they planned to cut his playing time for the 2013 season. Young did not request one, but the Rangers began to pursue a trade, and eventually traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies. Since being traded in 2012, the Rangers have not issued Young's uniform number 10 to any player or coach. In June 2019, the Rangers announced that they would be retiring Young's number 10 jersey.https://www.apnews.com/d0bb6876276c4f60a7463ee66d32b03c =Rangers career rankings= At the time of his departure from the team, Young lead the Rangers in several stat categories including games played (1774), hits (2178), doubles (406), triples (55), runs scored (1057), at bats (7221), strikeouts (1132), extra-base hits (632), and total bases (3210). He was third all time in runs batted in (RBIs) with 962 and sixth all time in home runs with 172. He also held several single-season records including most multi-hit games (70 in 2004), most hits (221 in 2005), doubles (52 in 2006), and at bats and plate appearances in 2006 (691 and 748 respectively). Philadelphia Phillies (2013) Young agreed to waive his no-trade clause and on December 9, 2012, was traded to the Phillies in exchange for pitcher Josh Lindblom and minor league pitcher Lisalverto Bonilla. The deal reunited him with former teammates Laynce Nix, Cliff Lee and Mike Adams. The Phillies were monitoring Young for some time prior to his acquisition. Their former Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt said, \\"we got a Derek Jeter kind of player on our team all of a sudden ... He's two or three Michael Young years away from being a Hall of Famer, first ballot maybe.\\" Phillies general manager Rub√©n Amaro, Jr. and manager Charlie Manuel also were fond of Young and made him a target headed into the Winter Meetings. Once they agreed to a deal, Young had to approve it, which he did, later mentioning that he would only have done so to go to a winning team like the Phillies. The Phillies viewed Young as a stop-gap to get them to top prospect Cody Asche. In 126 games with the Phillies, he hit .276 with 8 homers and 42 RBI. However, the Phillies did not turn out to be the \\"winning team\\" that Young had expected. On August 31, the Phillies' record stood at 62‚Äì74, and they were 21¬Ω games out of first place and 14 games out of the last available playoff spot. He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Upon leaving Philadelphia, Young released a statement in which he thanked the Phillies and said that he \\"had a blast\\" playing in Philadelphia and that he would recommend it \\"in a heartbeat\\" to any other player. Phillies players, namely younger players such as Darin Ruf and Cody Asche, commented that they loved having a veteran like Young to whom they could look up and seek advice from. Ruf said, \\"He was the type of guy to come up to a younger guy like myself or Cody and tell us a thing or two about what he thinks we need to do and how he thinks we could prolong our careers. He was just a great teammate to have around.\\" Los Angeles Dodgers (2013) Young with the Dodgers in 2013 On August 31, 2013, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor league pitcher Rob Rasmussen. In the last year of his contract, Young again waived his no-trade clause in order to join his hometown team for an expected playoff run. Young was acquired to be a backup infielder and provide a veteran presence on the team. Young made his Dodgers debut on September 1, 2013 pinch hitting in a game against the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in 21 games for the Dodgers at a variety of positions and hit .314. After initially considering some offers as a free agent, Young chose to announce his retirement from baseball on January 31, 2014. Career statistics In 1970 games over 14 seasons, Young posted a .300 batting average (2375-for-7918) with 1137 runs, 441 doubles, 60 triples, 185 home runs, 1030 RBI, 90 stolen bases, 575 bases on balls, .346 on-base percentage and .441 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .979 fielding percentage playing at all four infield positions. In 43 postseason games, he batted .238 (36-for-151) with 11 runs, 10 doubles, 3 home runs, 19 RBI and 5 walks. Post-playing career On November 5, 2014, Young was hired by the Texas Rangers as a special assistant to general manager Jon Daniels. He played a key role in the offseason acquisition of Ian Desmond in 2016. On July 30, 2016, Young was inducted into the Texas Rangers Baseball Hall of Fame in a pregame ceremony before the team's matchup with the Kansas City Royals. Young was eligible to be elected into the Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5% of the vote and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot. On August 31, 2019, the Texas Rangers retired Michael Young's #10. Personal life Young's mother is of Mexican descent. Young met his wife Cristina, also Mexican- American, while in high school. They have three sons named Mateo, Emilio, and Antonio respectively. Young is a cousin of former WBO Light Welterweight boxing champion Zack Padilla. Another of his cousins, Jason Young, also played minor league baseball. Young is also a philanthropist. He and his wife are sponsors of the Wipe Out Kids' Cancer campaign. In 2006, Young began the Young Heroes Scholarship Program, and in 2010, the Michael Young Family Hispanic Scholarship Program was established. In July 2011, Young and his wife announced the launch of the Michael Young Family Foundation, a charity which supports the involvement of children's health in all areas: physical social, mental, and educational. Young is represented by baseball agent Dan Lozano. Young is a two-time winner of the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award winning in 2008 and 2011. He is one of only four players who have won multiple times (John Smoltz, Jim Thome and Curtis Granderson). Young's hobbies include billiards and golf.

As a eugenicist, Grant was the author of The Passing of the Great Race (1916), a work espousing scientific racism, and played an active role in crafting strong immigration restriction and anti-miscegenation laws in the United States. As a conservationist, Grant is credited with the saving of many different species of animals, founding many different environmental and philanthropic organizations and developing much of the discipline of wildlife management. Early life Grant was born in New York City, New York, the son of Gabriel Grant, a physician and American Civil War surgeon, and Caroline Manice. Madison Grant's mother was a descendant of Jess√© de Forest, the Walloon Huguenot who in 1623 recruited the first band of colonists to settle in New Netherland, the Dutch Republic's territory on the American East Coast. On his father's side, Madison Grant's first American ancestor was Richard Treat, dean of Pitminster Church in England, who in 1630 was one of the first Puritan settlers of New England. Grant's forebears through Treat's line include Robert Treat (a colonial governor of New Jersey), Robert Treat Paine (a signer of the Declaration of Independence), Charles Grant (Madison Grant's grandfather, who served as an officer in the War of 1812), and Gabriel Grant (father of Madison), a prominent physician and the health commissioner of Newark, New Jersey.Zubrin, Robert (2012).

Defending the Master Race: Conservation, Eugenics, and the Legacy of Madison Grant. University of Vermont Press, pp. 6‚Äì7. During the Battle of Fair Oaks, he moved the wounded to safety while under heavy fire. Grant was a lifelong resident of New York City. Grant was the oldest of four siblings. The children's summers, and many of their weekends, were spent at Oatlands, the Long Island country estate built by their grandfather DeForest Manice in the 1830s.Spiro (2009), p. 7. As a child, he attended private schools and traveled Europe and the Middle East with his father. He attended Yale University, graduating early and with honors in 1887. He received a law degree from Columbia Law School, and practiced law after graduation; however, his interests were primarily those of a naturalist. He never married and had no children. He first achieved a political reputation when he and his brother, De Forest Grant, took part in the 1894 electoral campaign of New York mayor William Lafayette Strong. Conservation efforts Grant was a close friend of several U.S. presidents, including Theodore Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover, and also was an avid conservationist. He is credited with saving many natural species from extinction, and co-founded the Save the Redwoods League with Frederick Russell Burnham, John C. Merriam, and Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1918. He is also credited with helping develop the first deer hunting laws in New York state, legislation which spread to other states as well over time. He was also the creator of wildlife management; helped to found the Bronx Zoo, build the Bronx River Parkway, save the American bison as an organizer of the American Bison Society, and helped to create Glacier National Park and Denali National Park. In 1906, as Secretary of the New York Zoological Society, he lobbied to put Ota Benga, a Congolese man from the Mbuti people (a tribe of \\"pygmies\\"), on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he served on the boards of many eugenic and philanthropic societies, including the board of trustees at the American Museum of Natural History, as director of the American Eugenics Society, vice president of the Immigration Restriction League, a founding member of the Galton Society, and one of the eight members of the International Committee of Eugenics. He was awarded the gold medal of the Society of Arts and Sciences in 1929. In 1931, the world's largest tree (in Dyerville, California) was dedicated to Grant, Merriam, and Osborn by the California State Board of Parks in recognition for their environmental efforts. A subspecies of caribou was named after Grant as well (Rangifer tarandus granti, also known as Grant's Caribou). He was a member of the Boone and Crockett Club (a big game hunting organization) since 1893, where he was friends with president Theodore Roosevelt. He was head of the New York Zoological Society from 1925 until his death. Historian Jonathan Spiro has argued that Grant's interests in conservationism and eugenics were not unrelated: both are hallmarks of the early 20th-century Progressive movement, and both assume the need for various types of stewardship over their charges. In Grant's mind, natural resources needed to be conserved for the Nordic Race, to the exclusion of other races. Grant viewed the Nordic race lovingly as he did any of his endangered species, and considered the modern industrial society as infringing just as much on its existence as it did on the redwoods. Like many eugenicists, Grant saw modern civilization as a violation of \\"survival of the fittest\\", whether it manifested itself in the over-logging of the forests, or the survival of the poor via welfare or charity. Nordic theory Title page of Grant's book The Passing of the Great Race (1916) Grant was the author of the once much-read book The Passing of the Great RaceLindsay, J.A.

Similar ideas were proposed by prehistorian Gustav Kossinna in Germany. Grant promoted the idea of the \\"Nordic race\\",Alexander, Charles C.

As an avid eugenicist, Grant further advocated the separation, quarantine, and eventual collapse of \\"undesirable\\" traits and \\"worthless race types\\" from the human gene pool and the promotion, spread, and eventual restoration of desirable traits and \\"worthwhile race types\\" conducive to Nordic society: \\"Maximum Expansion of Alpines\\"‚ÄîMap from Passing of the Great Race showing the \\"essentially peasant\\" Alpine migrations into Europe. \\"Expansion of the Pre-Teutonic Nordics\\"‚ÄîEarly Nordic influence spreading over the continent. \\"Expansion of the Teutonic Nordics and Slavic Alpines\\"‚ÄîFurther Nordic expansion, as well as the Alpines. \\"Present Distribution of the European Races\\" (1916)‚ÄîGrant's vision of the status quo, with the Nordics in red, the Alpines in green, and the Mediterraneans in yellow. In the book, Grant recommends segregating \\"unfavorable\\" races in ghettos, by installing civil organizations through the public health system to establish quasi- dictatorships in their particular fields. He states the expansion of non- Nordic race types in the Nordic system of freedom would actually mean a slavery to desires, passions, and base behaviors. In turn, this corruption of society would lead to the subjection of the Nordic community to \\"inferior\\" races, who would in turn long to be dominated and instructed by \\"superior\\" ones utilizing authoritarian powers. The result would be the submergence of the indigenous Nordic races under a corrupt and enfeebled system dominated by inferior races, and both in turn would be subjected by a new ruling race class. Nordic theory, in Grant's formulation, was similar to many 19th-century racial philosophies, which divided the human species into primarily three distinct races: Caucasoids (based in Europe), Negroids (based in Africa), and Mongoloids (based in Asia). Nordic theory, however, further subdivided Caucasoids into three groups: Nordics (who inhabited Northern Europe and other parts of the continent), Alpines (whose territory included central Europe and parts of Asia), and Mediterraneans (who inhabited Southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East). In Grant's view, Nordics probably evolved in a climate that \\"must have been such as to impose a rigid elimination of defectives through the agency of hard winters and the necessity of industry and foresight in providing the year's food, clothing, and shelter during the short summer. Such demands on energy, if long continued, would produce a strong, virile, and self-contained race which would inevitably overwhelm in battle nations whose weaker elements had not been purged by the conditions of an equally severe environment.\\"The Passing of the Great Race (1916), pp. 152‚Äì153. The \\"Proto-Nordic\\" human, Grant reasoned, probably evolved in eastern Germany, Poland and Russia, before migrating northward to Scandinavia. The Nordic, in his theory, was Homo europaeus, the white man par excellence. \\"It is everywhere characterized by certain unique specializations, namely, wavy brown or blond hair and blue, gray or light brown eyes, fair skin, high, narrow and straight nose, which are associated with great stature, and a long skull, as well as with abundant head and body hair.\\"The Passing of the Great Race (1916), p. 150. Grant categorized the Alpines as being the lowest of the three European races, with the Nordics as the pinnacle of civilization. Grant, while aware of the \\"Nordic migration theory\\" into the Mediterranean, appears to reject this theory as an explanation for the high civilization features of the Greco-Roman world. Grant also considered North Africa as part of Mediterranean Europe: Yet while Grant recognized Mediterraneans to have abilities in art, as quoted above, later in the text, he pondered if the Mediterranean achievements in civilization were due to Nordic original ideals and structure: According to Grant, Nordics were in a dire state in the modern world, where, because of their abandonment of cultural values, rooted in religious or superstitious proto-racialism, they were close to committing \\"race suicide\\" by miscegenation and by being outbred by inferior stock taking advantage of the situation. The book passed through multiple printings in the United States, and was translated into other languages, including German in 1925. By 1937, the book had sold 16,000 copies in the United States alone. Nordic theory was strongly embraced by the racial hygiene movement in Germany in the early 1920s and 1930s, in which, however, they typically used the term \\"Aryan\\" instead of \\"Nordic\\", although the principal Nazi ideologist, Alfred Rosenberg, preferred \\"Aryo-Nordic\\" or \\"Nordic-Atlantean\\". Stephen Jay Gould described The Passing of the Great Race as \\"the most influential tract of American scientific racism\\". Grant's work was embraced by proponents of the National Socialist movement in Germany and was the first non-German book ordered to be reprinted by the Nazis when they took power. Adolf Hitler wrote to Grant, \\"The book is my Bible.\\" Grant's work is considered one of the most influential and vociferous works of scientific racism and eugenics to come out of the United States. One of his long-time opponents was the anthropologist Franz Boas. Grant disliked Boas and for several years tried to get him fired from his position at Columbia University. Boas and Grant were involved in a bitter struggle for control over the discipline of anthropology in the United States, while they both served (along with others) on the National Research Council Committee on Anthropology after the First World War. Grant represented the \\"hereditarian\\" branch of physical anthropology at the time, despite his relatively amateur status, and was staunchly opposed to and by Boas himself (and the latter's students), who advocated cultural anthropology. Boas and his students eventually wrested control of the American Anthropological Association from Grant and his supporters, who had used it as a flagship organization for his brand of anthropology. In response, Grant, along with American eugenicist and biologist Charles B. Davenport, in 1918 founded the Galton Society as an alternative to Boas.Spiro 2002 Immigration restriction Grant in the 1920s. Grant advocated restricted immigration to the United States through limiting immigration from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe, as well as the complete end of immigration from East Asia. He also advocated efforts to purify the American population through selective breeding. He served as the vice president of the Immigration Restriction League from 1922 to his death. Acting as an expert on world racial data, Grant also provided statistics for the Immigration Act of 1924 to set the quotas on immigrants from certain European countries. Even after passing the statute, Grant continued to be irked that even a smattering of non-Nordics were allowed to immigrate to the country each year. He also assisted in the passing and prosecution of several anti-miscegenation laws, including the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 in the state of Virginia, where he sought to codify his particular version of the \\"one-drop rule\\" into law. Though Grant was extremely influential in legislating his view of racial theory, he began to fall out of favor in the United States in the 1930s. The declining interest in his work has been attributed both to the effects of the Great Depression, which resulted in a general backlash against Social Darwinism and related philosophies, and to the changing dynamics of racial issues in the United States during the interwar period. Rather than subdivide Europe into separate racial groups, the bi-racial (black vs. white) theory of Grant's protege Lothrop Stoddard became more dominant in the aftermath of the Great Migration of African-Americans from Southern States to Northern and Western ones (Guterl 2001). Legacy Grant became a part of popular culture in 1920s America, especially in New York. Grant's conservationism and fascination with zoological natural history made him very influential among the New York elite who agreed with his cause, most notably Theodore Roosevelt. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald featured a reference to Grant in The Great Gatsby. Tom Buchanan, the husband of Daisy Buchanan, the novel's principal female character, was reading a book called The Rise of the Colored Empires by \\"this man Goddard\\", a portmanteau of Grant's Passing of the Great Race and his colleague Lothrop Stoddard's The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy (Grant wrote the introduction to Stoddard's book). In May 1921, soon after his unhappy first visit to Europe, Fitzgerald wrote to Edmund Wilson: > God damn the continent of Europe. It is of merely antiquarian interest. Rome > is only a few years behind Tyre and Babylon. The negroid streak creeps > northward to defile the Nordic race. Already the Italians have the souls of > blackamoors. Raise the bars of immigration and permit only Scandinavians, > Teutons, Anglo-Saxons and Celts to enter. France made me sick. Its silly > pose as the thing the world has to save. I think it's a shame that England > and America didn't let Germany conquer Europe. It's the only thing that > would have saved the fleet of tottering old wrecks. (Letters 326) Fitzgerald recognized the racism implicit in these statements and seemed to abhor it. \\"My reactions,\\" he wrote \\"were all philistine, anti-socialistic, provincial and racially snobbish.\\" Yet he continued in the same vein as previously: \\"I believe at last in the white man's burden. We are as far above the modern Frenchman as he is above the Negro. Even in art!\\" And so on\\".Margolies, Alan (1997). \\"The Maturing of F. Scott Fitzgerald\\".

Grant left no offspring when he died in 1937 of nephritis. Several hundred people attended Grant's funeral, and he was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Tarrytown, New York. He left a bequest of $25,000 to the New York Zoological Society to create \\"The Grant Endowment Fund for the Protection of Wild Life\\", left $5,000 to the American Museum of Natural History, and left another $5,000 to the Boone and Crockett Club. Grant was not only a crusading environmentalist. He opposed war, had doubts about imperialism, and strongly supported birth control.Leonard, Thomas C. Illiberal Reformers Princeton University Press 2016 p. 116 Passing of the Great Race was lauded by Adolf Hitler, who in the early 1930s wrote a 'fan letter' to Grant in which he called the book \\"my Bible\\".Arnold, Kathleen R. (2011). Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. p. 227. . At the postwar Nuremberg Trials, Grant's Passing of the Great Race was introduced into evidence by the defense of Karl Brandt, Hitler's personal physician and head of the Nazi euthanasia program, in order to justify the population policies of the Third Reich, or at least indicate that they were not ideologically unique to Nazi Germany. Grant's works of \\"scientific racism\\" have been cited to demonstrate that many of the genocidal and eugenic ideas associated with the Third Reich did not arise specifically in Germany, and in fact that many of them had origins in other countries, including the United States.Black, Edwin (2003). War Against the Weak. Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race. New York: Four Walls Eight Windows, pp. 259, 273, 274‚Äì275, 296. As such, because of Grant's well-connected and influential friends, he is often used to illustrate the strain of race-based eugenic thinking in the United States, which had some influence until the Second World War. Because of the use made of Grant's eugenics work by the policy-makers of Nazi Germany, his work as a conservationist has been somewhat ignored and obscured, as many organizations with which he was once associated (such as the Sierra Club) wanted to minimize their association with him. Grant was mentioned in Anders Behring Breivik's 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, in which Breivik argues for the preservation of the Nordic race and criticized miscegenation.2083: A European Declaration of Independence.

It has a widespread distribution, being found in North America, Australia, Asia, and Europe, where it causes a white rot in the heartwood of living and dead hardwood trees. The name \\"dryad's saddle\\" refers to creatures in Greek mythology called dryads who could conceivably fit and ride on this mushroom, whereas the pheasant's back analogy derives from the pattern of colors on the bracket matching that of a pheasant's back. Taxonomy The species was first described scientifically by British botanist William Hudson in 1778, who named it Boletus squamosus. It was given its current name in 1886 by Qu√©let but is still widely known by the Friesian name \\"Polyporus squamosus\\". Description This mushroom is commonly attached to dead logs or stumps at one point with a thick stem. Generally, the fruit body is across and up to thick. The body can be yellow to brown and has \\"squamules\\" or scales on its upper side. On the underside one can see the pores that are characteristic of the genus Cerioporus; they are made up of tubes packed together closely. The tubes are between long. The stalk is thick and short, up to long. The fruit body will produce a white spore print if laid onto a sheet of paper. They can be found alone, in clusters of two or three, or forming shelves. Young specimens are soft but toughen with age. It is particularly common on dead elm and is also found on living maple trees. Distribution and habitat This organism is common and widespread, being found east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and over much of Europe. It is also found in Australia and Asia. It commonly fruits in the spring, occasionally during autumn, and rarely during other seasons. Many mushroom hunters will stumble upon this when looking for morels during the spring as both have similar fruiting times, and this fungus can grow to a noticeable size of up to across. It plays an important role in woodland ecosystems by decomposing wood, usually elm, but is occasionally a parasite on living trees. Other tree hosts include ash, beech, horse chestnut, Persian walnut, lime, maple, planetree, poplar, magnolia, and willow. Edibility and uses Edible when young. They can become infested with maggots and become firm, rubbery and inedible as they mature. Cookbooks dealing with preparation generally recommend gathering these while young, slicing them into small pieces and cooking them over a low heat. Some people value the thick, stiff paper that can be made from this and many other mushrooms of the genus Cerioporus. The mushroom's smell resembles watermelon rind. Polyporus squamosus has a mild nutty flavour.

It is currently managed by the Forest, Wildlife and Fisheries department of the Government of Pakistan. Today the zoo houses a collection of about 1378 animals of 135 species. Lahore Zoo was the host of the fifth annual conference of SAZARC in 2004. The stated mission of the zoo is: Lahore Zoo is thought to be the third or fourth oldest zoo in the world. House of Vienna Zoo of Austria, established in 1752 as a menagerie, was opened to public as a zoo in 1779. London Zoo of England, established in 1828, was opened to public in 1847. The Alipore Zoo of India, established some time in the early 19th century, was opened to public as a zoo in 1876. History alt= Lahore Zoo had its beginnings in a small aviary donated by Lal Mahundra Ram in 1872 to the Lahore Municipal Corporation. Over time the animal collection increased and the zoo expanded. It later began to take interest in conservation, education and research in addition to providing recreational facilities to the public. By 2010, the zoo was home to about 1280 trees of 71 species and 1380 animals of 136 species including 996 birds of 82 species, 49 reptiles of 8 and 336 mammals of 45 species. The zoo was managed by the Lahore Municipal Corporation from 1872 to 1923, when management was turned over to the Deputy Commissioner of Lahore. Management was transferred to the Livestock and Dairy Development department in 1962, and then to the Wildlife and Parks department in 1982. Between its founding in 1872 and its turnover to the Wildlife and Parks department in 1982 there was very little development at the zoo. Since 1982, it has upgraded its exhibits, layout, and landscaping, and has become a self-financing organization. A master planning, improvement and development project of 18 months duration was approved in on July 25, 2005. It was carried out by 'Zoo Maintenance Committee' and sponsored by Planning and Development Department of Government of Punjab. The project cost around 202.830 million Pakistani rupees and aimed for the improvement and addition of facilities. Areas and attractions  Fancy Birds Aviary  Located just east of the zoo's main entrance, this is the oldest section of the zoo, as the zoo itself started out as an aviary in 1872. It is home to most of the zoo's gamebirds and parrots. The area consists of four rows of double-sided bird cages housing peafowl, pheasants, partridges, western crowned pigeons and various species of parrots including macaws, grey parrots and conures, among others. Located at the eastern end of this section are a row of enclosures housing a pack of Asiatic jackals, juvenile spur-thighed tortoises and Asian houbara. Nearby is a small enclosure, once home to smooth- coated otters, housing Indian flapshell turtles and red-eared sliders, this enclosure also acts as temporary holding pen for the zoo's juvenile mugger crocodiles.  Lion House  Originally constructed in 1872, the current Lion House complex, covering an area of 24,500 square feet was built in 1987 at a cost of 5.1 million rupees and was renovated in 2012. It comprises three concrete buildings with indoor cages and each building have two adjoining outdoor enclosures. The first of these buildings is home to the zoo's Bengal tigers and pumas. Lahore Zoo currently has fifteen tigers and three pumas, most of which have been born at the zoo. The second building, consisting of three indoor compartments and two outdoor enclosures, houses the zoo's lions. From the 2015 to 2016 13 lion cubs were born at the zoo, currently the zoo is home to more than 20 lions. The third, and final, building is home to the zoo's family of black bears. The zoo's resident black bear pair has given birth to two litters of two cubs, born in 2009 and 2011, all of which currently reside at the zoo. This is the only enclosure in the Lion House that does not have indoor viewing for visitors.  Elephant House  Constructed in 1972 at a cost of 500,000 rupees, this is one of the most popular attractions of the zoo. It consists of three large indoor rooms each with adjoining outdoor paddocks. Originally housing three endangered pachyderm species native to Africa, African plains elephant, southern white rhinoceros and common hippopotamus, it currently houses a female hippo, Rani, that was brought to the zoo in July 2006 and a male white rhinoceros. The zoo's only elephant, Suzi, which had been resident at the zoo since 1988 died in May, 2017, from several illnesses, leaving the zoo without an elephant. The zoo's male hippo, Raja, was brought to the zoo in 1974 and at the time of his death, in October, 2015, was the oldest resident of the zoo, at 51. There had been attempts by the zoo administration to breed hippos but these had failed due to Raja's old age. The zoo's female white rhino, Kawo, died in 2014 on account of old age.  Monkey House  Constructed in 2012 over the zoo's previous out of date monkey house, these four new enclosure are located just west of the zoo's main entrance of main gate. The first enclosure houses the zoo's olive baboon family, currently numbering around nine individuals. The next two enclosure houses a pair of tufted capuchins and mantled guerezas. The final enclosure is home to a family of vervet monkeys. Housed, in nearby enclosures, are the zoo's family of porcupines, adult spur-thighed tortoises and a pair of smooth-coated otters. Species previously housed in the Monkey House include black-footed grey langurs, mandrills and spider monkeys.  Chimpanzee House  Home to the zoo's chimpanzees, this building houses a wide array of other species including wolves, swamp cats and rhesus macaques. The zoo's first pair of chimps, male Romeo and female Julie, had been brought in 1994. A male chimp, Tinku was born to the pair in 2000 but died due to pneumonia in September, 2004. In August, 2001, Julie gave birth to two female chimps, named Pinky and Honey. Romeo died, also of pneumonia, in 2008. Juliet succumbed to hepatitis in 2012 and Pinky died in 2014, leaving Honey the only chimpanzee left at the zoo. This building also acts as a temporary holding area for various species of cats, including leopards, lions and pumas. Species previously housed here include cheetahs and baboons.  Waterfowl Lake  Located south of the Fancy Aviary, this lake houses various species of waterfowl and wading birds. It consists of four islands with some of the oldest trees in the zoo. Located adjacent to the enclosure is a banyan tree that is reported to be over 400 years old. Species housed in this part of the zoo include black swans, Muscovy ducks, lesser flamingos and Dalmatian pelicans. Located nearby is a small enclosure housing a pair of wild boars.  Reptile House  This building houses most of the zoo's reptiles, including Indian cobras, Sindh kraits, saw-scaled vipers and Indian pythons. The Reptile House was renovated in 2006, providing better ventilation to the exhibits and air conditioning for the animals. Other animals housed include guinea pigs. A small taxidermy museum, displaying various species of animals that previously lived at the zoo, is also present in the building.  Walk- through Aviary  Located directly east of the Reptile House, the three-domed walk-through aviary is relatively new construction. Entry to the aviary is not included in general admission ticket of the zoo. Species housed in this enclosure include various species of pheasants, Indian peafowl and demoiselle cranes. As of 2015 the Walk-through Aviary was not open to the public.  Chimpanzee Island  This is a large moated enclosure located south of the waterfowl lake that was originally created to house the zoo's chimpanzee, but because of deaths of all but one of the chimpanzees, this enclosure currently houses a pair of Himalayan brown bears.  Urial hillock  Located on west of, and right in front of the entrance to, the Reptile House, is a small naturally created hill that is home to urials and mouflons held in two separate enclosures.  Others  Other notable animals found at Lahore Zoo include giraffes, mugger crocodiles, blackbucks, nilgais, red deer, hog deer, guanacos, plains zebra, ostrich, emus and southern cassowary, vulturine guineafowl.

Some of these are listed below: *Alstonia scholaris - locally termed ditabark - native to India and Pakistan *Bombax malabaricum- locally termed sunbal or silk cotton tree - native to Himalayas *Callistemon citrinus - locally termed bottle brush - native to Australia *Dalbergia sissoo - locally termed shisham - native to India and Pakistan *Delonix regia - locally termed gulmohar - native to Madagascar *Erythrina suberosa - locally termed coral or gul nister - native to Myanmar *Ficus benghalensis - locally termed banyan - native to Bangladesh *Ficus religiosa - locally termed pipal - native to India and Pakistan *Ficus retusa - locally termed bobari - native to Malaysia *Kigelia pinnata - locally termed gul-e-fanoos or sausage - native to Africa *Livistona chinensis - locally termed bottle palm - native to China *Mangifera indica - locally termed aam - native to India and Pakistan *Mimusops elengi - locally termed molsery - native to Pakistan *Pongamia pinnata - locally termed sukh chayn or Indian beech - native to Himalayas *Syzygium cumini - locally termed jamu - native to India and Pakistan *Ziziphus zizyphus - locally termed jujube - native to Himalayas File:A colorful tree in zoo.JPGA coral tree (Erythrina suberosa) File:An Old tree in zoo.JPGAn old banyan (Ficus benghalensis) File:A beautiful plant at Lahore Zoo.jpgAnother plantation Safari park A pair of lions at Lahore Zoo Safari Lahore Zoo Safari was opened on January 21, 2009, a renovation of Lahore Wildlife Park (also called Woodland Wildlife Park) which was established in 1982. The Safari Park is located near Raiwind Road about from the Lahore Zoo. The species housed here include Indian peafowl, Bengal tiger, common pheasant, emu, lion, mute swan, nilgai, ostrich and silver pheasant among a few others. The wildlife park is now considered to be an extension of Lahore Zoo. The Government of Pakistan turned management of the wildlife park over to the Zoo Maintenance Committee headed by the chairman of the Punjab branch of the Wildlife & Parks department. Vice-chairman Tauqeer Shah said this transfer of control was due to poor previous management that was not working to improve the park. A ticket system was introduced in the wildlife park so that the Lahore Zoo Safari could become a semi-autonomous, self-financed organization.

Lahore Zoo also has plenty of areas for visitors to picnic. A waterfall was created for visitors, and statues of various animals have been placed within the boundaries of the zoo. Education  The education officer of Lahore Zoo is Kiran Saleem. The zoo hosts guided tours for school groups, as well as placing information boards about the animals and plants around the zoo. A touch table has been set up to let children to touch animal parts like skins, horns, feathers and eggs that they cannot otherwise see or feel. The zoo has also prepared brochures and posters about endangered species in Pakistan like Ganges and Indus river dolphin. On September 5, 2009, Lahore Zoo celebrated the International Vulture Awareness Day and distributed posters regarding the importance of vultures in ecosystems. Reasons of sharp decline of populations of Indian white-rumped vulture were made known to local people. In 2010, Lahore Zoo celebrated events like World Environment Day on June 5 and World Animal Day on October 4. This particular and colorful event was organized by the students of Zoology department, University of the Punjab, Lahore. The students (BS.hons Batch 2010-14) participated actively to arrange for the event in the supervision of their course instructor, former Education officer of Lahore Zoo, Bushra Nisar Khan. In November 2010, Lahore Zoo started its first publication, a quarterly newsletter. It is said to be the part of the education and awareness programme.  Research facilities  The Lahore Zoo, with the assistance of its education office in particular, provides research facilities and supports relevant studies at the zoo. Scores of students from University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences and University of the Punjab work in collaboration with Lahore Zoo to complete their research projects and internships. As a prime example, the zoo provided direct assistance to a research project with the kind approval of Director General Wildlife and Parks Department, Punjab. The study was conducted by a BS.Hons student of Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab. The researcher, Sana Ahmed, presented her synopsis as to study the public perception about the zoo and the role it plays to enhance the visitors' experience. The study included a survey from more than 200 zoo visitors, questioning them about different zoo facilities, animal species kept at zoo and about their experiences and suggestions. The study provided a useful insight to how visitors perceive the zoo. Likewise, it helped the zoo in shaping future strategies to design and launch interactive public awareness campaigns about ex-situ conservation. The research paper was presented in the National conference and training workshop of Wildlife and Aerobiology, held at University of the Punjab, Lahore. The researcher, first author of the paper (co-author of 3 other papers) got her paper publish in The Journal of Animal and Plant Sciences under the title, \\"The Study of Public Perception for Captive Animals at Lahore Zoo, Pakistan.\\" Gift shop In 2005, a gift shop was opened in joint collaboration between Pakistan branch of WWF and the Lahore Zoo. Ali Bokhari, the marketing head of WWF-Pakistan, stated that the profit earned would be split in half between the Lahore Zoo and WWF-Pakistan. Lahore Zoo would make souvenirs from the profit which would be on sale at the shop, while the WWF would invest it on the conservation of nature in Pakistan. The products include shirts, mugs, plush toys, posters, caps and bags among many others. Breeding efforts *Asian black bear: In September 2009, a rescued female was given to Lahore Zoo by World Wide Fund for Nature. Lahore Zoo was successful in breeding the species when twins were born in early January 2010. The cubs, however, went missing on 17 January. *Chimpanzee: A pair (named 'Romeo', the male and 'Juliet', the female) were brought to the zoo in 1994. They gave birth to a male named 'Tinku' in April 2000, another female named 'Pinky' in 2004 and a female named 'Honey' in April 2005.GC University - Zoology Department adopts a Chimpanzee for Rs. 35,000 In October 2004, the Wildlife Department of Pakistan told the Daily Times that the four-year-old 'Tinku' had died some time in early August from pneumonia. On September 17, 2008, Romeo died at the age of 21 from a prolonged illness. *Hippopotamus: A 6 years old male hippopotamus was brought to the zoo on January 16, 1974. On July 11, 2006, zoo bought a 6 years old female to mate with the male that have been at the zoo for over three decades. An expert said that this was pointless because the male had passed its reproductive stage. Raja died on October 25, 2015. *Gharial: In November 2004, Lahore Zoo exchanged animals with Karachi Zoo including a male gharial. Lahore Zoo already had three female gharials and with a male, it could initiate a conservation attempt. The male was transported by truck to the zoo, but died the day after it was transferred. Currently there are only two female gharials at the zoo. *Leopard: On 18 January 2006, zoo officials said that a seven- year-old female wild leopard was caught at Muree and brought to Lahore Zoo for breeding. However, it died about a month later on 21 February because of nervousness. On 5 April 2009, it was reported that 3 leopards (black panthers; one male and two female) purchased in February 2009 had to be returned because they had become sick. Currently Lahore Zoo houses only two leopards. Plans On December 8, 2010, it was announced that the administration of Lahore Zoo is planning to make Reema Khan, an actress, as the ambassador of wildlife in captivity. Current zoo director, Iqbal Khalid, told Dawn News that Khan will help create awareness among citizens about wildlife issues. It was also revealed, that Lahore Zoo will start renting exotic animals from other countries. This will give a chance to local people to learn more about different animals across the globe. Lahore Zoo plans to rent two giant pandas from People's Republic of China. \\"Once it gets a sponsor, the zoo administration will submit a request to the Chinese government for the animal, which is popular around the world. Chinese officials will visit the zoo to inspect housing and health facilities for pandas,\\" said Khalid. In September, 2015, the Lahore Zoo administration announced plans to bring 19 new animals in order to maintain a healthy gene pool in the zoo. Zoo director Hassan Ali Sukhaira also stated that veterinary lab, with pathological and hematological labs, treatment rooms and an ICU, will be established at the zoo. The first of these new animals, a trio of giraffes, arrived at the zoo on 26, June. 2018. Controversies The plight of captive animals at Lahore Zoo, has been subject to criticism by local animal rights activists. Safety and security concerns On 21 November 1999, an Asian black bear killed an 18-month-old boy named Abdullah in the zoo. The child, who was with his parents, tried to shake hands with the caged animal. The bear pulled the boy into the cage and tore him apart. An angry crowd tried to kill the animal but the police intervened to bring the situation under control. Zoo officials blamed the parents for allowing the boy to touch the animal. On 8 January 2004, an attendant at the zoo was attacked by a red fox when its cage was left unlocked, causing a panic among visitors. On 9 April 2007, two stray dogs entered an Indian peafowl pen from a broken portion of a fence and managed to kill about 28 peafowl. This resulted in criticism as Indian peafowl is considered sacred in Indian subcontinent. On 10 May 2009, it was reported that a new born macaw was stolen from the zoo. The zoo director said that someone from the zoo staff must have been responsible. On 17 January 2010, two Asian black bear cubs went missing from the zoo. Animal deaths Lahore Zoo has been criticized for not having the level of medical facilities expected in a modern zoo. Zoo officials reported in April 2005 that three female black- footed gray langurs died due to cold weather the previous winter. In November 2005, a male mandrill and male puma died at the zoo. A female Asian black bear died in mid-February 2006. In September 2006, some animals at the zoo were diagnosed with tuberculosis, which can also be transmitted to humans, but early detection and treatment prevented an outbreak. In January 2009, a female giraffe was attacked by a plains zebra and died soon after due to injuries. In October 2004 the Wildlife Department of Pakistan told the Daily Times that a four-year-old male chimpanzee had died in early August from pneumonia, but zoo management had not revealed this news to public immediately. In September 2008, another male chimpanzee died at the age of 21 from a prolonged unidentified illness. Lahore Zoo received a pair of Bengal tigers from Belgium in 1992 to start their captive breeding program. In 1997, six Bengal tigers died from Trypanosomiasis at the zoo, and in 2006, four more became victims. In July 2007, two female Bengal tigers, one of which had given the zoo 19 cubs, died from same disease. In early May 2009, a 3-year-old female Bengal tiger died after a cesarean section to take out her dead babies. In April 2009, a Bengal tiger gave birth to four In July 2009, a lion gave birth to two cubs but killed them by eating their heads. Director, Zafar Shah, said that the lion had been killing her cubs for the last three years and is a victim of cannibalism - a mental disease found in 5-6% of lions worldwide. At Lahore Zoo, there have been many births of Bengal tiger cubs who are deformed and do not survive long. In late 2010, the officials showed concern for the issue of inbreeding that might be the reason behind these deaths. In early November 2010, Lahore Zoo received 53 falcons which were being illegally transported to Qatar from Benazir Bhutto International Airport. 16 falcons died due to heat strokes and other reasons. In April 2011, the zoo officials returned the remaining falcons to the wildlife department to be set free so that they can migrate to colder regions. Smuggling scandal On 27 March 2009, two white Bengal tigers were brought into Pakistan from Indonesia without necessary import documents and sold to the Lahore Zoo. The sources said that trans- boundary movement of the rare and endangered species was controlled by the CITES and that a certificate of permission from CITES and permission from the Islamabad-based National Council for Conservation of Wildlife (NCCW) were both required before import of the animals. Lahore Zoo had neither. The director of the zoo, Yusuf Paul said the zoo had purchased two female white Bengal tigers from supplier Mohammad Afzal of a Lahore-based organisation, Animal World, for 7.6 million Pakistani rupees.

The show was groundbreaking in that it was the first soap opera to feature from its inception an African-American family. Premise This half-hour serial was promoted as television's first fully integrated daytime soap. It focused on the relationship between two Chicago families: the Whitmores and the Marshalls. Their association began several decades ago when Vivian Potter was housekeeper and nanny for Rebecca Whitmore and her three children: Laura (Gail Ramsey), Stephanie (nicknamed Sam) (Kelly Rutherford), and J.D. Vivian's young daughter, Ruth (Joan Pringle) lived with her in the Whitmore mansion. When Ruth grew up, she married Henry Marshall (Taurean Blacque, James Reynolds), who owned and operated five moderately successful ice cream parlors. With Ruth's urging, Henry enlisted the help of business mogul Martin Jackson (Rick Fitts), who marketed Marshall's ice cream nationwide. The move proved so successful that Ruth was able to buy the Whitmore mansion. Ruth and Henry had three children, Chantal (Sharon Brown, Debbi Morgan), a lawyer, Jacquelyn Marshall Rhymes, a homemaker and mother, and Adam (Kristoff St. John), a junior executive with the Hale Hotel chain. Living with the Marshalls was Ruth's mother, Vivian (Lynn Hamilton). Sam, Monique and Adam were all childhood friends who grew up together. Like Ruth Marshall, Rebecca Whitmore (Pat Crowley; Dorothy Lyman) also had a challenging past to overcome. Unknown to Rebecca, her ex-husband Peter (Ron Harper) stole her inheritance, and abandoned her. Determined to move forward with her life, a middle-aged Rebecca enrolled in law school and succeeded in becoming one of the nation's leading attorneys. When the serial premiered, her daughter Laura was married to advertising executive Trevor McCallum. Realizing that Trevor was cheating on her, Laura ended the marriage. They had an adult daughter, Monique (Nancy Sorrell). Although Rebecca was saddened by the break-up of her oldest daughter's marriage, she was happy to see her granddaughter, Monique, marry photographer Jason Craig. Soon after their marriage, Jason inherited a multimillion dollar fortune, making him a murder target for his mother's crazy aunt, Mary Gardener. Monique's aunt, Sam accepted a position as model and spokesperson for the upscale Hale Hotel chain afer leaving college. Sam was a seductive, slightly promiscuous young woman initially, and was having an affair with one of her college professors, Rob Donnelly (George Deloy). As time went on however, Sam matured into a warmer, more responsible person and became one of the show's most popular characters. Sam's boss, the dastardly Jordan Hale, expressed an interest in Sam that went beyond business. Police detective Kyle Masters (Robert Torti) was also wildly attracted to Sam. Doreen Jackson (Jonelle Allen), a recovering drug addict, was married to Martin Jackson. Following a brief fling with Adam Marshall, Doreen found herself pregnant. Before their daughter, Danielle, was born, the relationship died. When he discovered the affair, a vengeful Martin tried to destroy Adam's life, but Doreen gathered damning evidence against Martin and his numerous ruthless business dealings over the years and threatened to expose him if he ever tried to harm Adam again. She would eventually use that information to help Henry and Ruth drive Martin out of the country when he tried to take over Marshall's Ice Cream. Martin kidnapped Danielle, attempting to flee with her, but Adam and Sam stopped him and he was forced to leave without her to save himself. However, Martin had a videotape of him revealing Danielle'a true parentage sent to the Marshalls shortly afterward. The family was shocked over the revelation and Ruth, furious at being deceived, cut Doreen out of her life, devastating her. The rest of the family urged Ruth to forgive Doreen, reminding her that destroying their friendship with her was giving Martin exactly what he wanted. After an emotional conversation with Doreen, Ruth realized just how difficult it had been for her to keep Danielle's secret for so long and they reconciled. Doreen next took up with her doctor, Daniel Reubens (Richard Roundtree). He resurfaced in Chicago in 1990 with his daughter, Maya Davis - alias Diana Reubens (Vivica A. Fox) - after falsely being accused of killing his wife.

L. Cross (Editor), E. A. Livingstone (Editor) Oxford University Press, USA; 3 edition p.904 (March 13, 1997) Our information about him is derived principally from the work of St. Jerome in two books, Adversus Jovinianum. Jerome referred to him as the \\"Epicurus of Christianity\\". He was a native of Corduene.H. Schlagintweit, H. K. Forstner, Lehrgang Kunstgeschichte: Von der Antike bis zur Moderne zum Selbststudium der Kunststile, 186 pp., Schwabe Verlag Basel, , , pp.371-372 John Henry Newman called Aerius of Sebaste, Jovinian and Vigilantius the forerunners of Protestantism, likening them to the \\"Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli of the fourth century\\". Life Jovinian was a monk at one time in his life, but subsequently turned against monastic asceticism--though without giving up his status as monk. Jovinian was apparently broadly read and adduced examples from secular literature, which did not sit well at the synods. He became the leader of a group of disciples: Auxentius, Genialis, Germinator, Felix, Prontinus, Martianus, Januarius and Ingeniosus are identified in the act of 390 condemning him. His writings praising the excellence of marriage, which he published from Rome, were condemned at a synod held in Rome under Pope Siricius and subsequently at the Milan synod. Jovinian, in the polemical view of his chief opponent, Jerome, has some of the style of an \\"Epicurus of Christianity.\\" The following is a passage attributed to Jovinian by Jerome in his \\"Against Jovinian:\\" > I respond to your invitation, not that I may go through life with a high > reputation, but may live free from idle rumour. I beseech the ground, the > young shoots of our plantations, the plants and trees of tenderness snatched > from the whirlpool of vice, to grant me audience and the support of many > listeners. We know that the Church through hope, faith, charity, is > inaccessible and impregnable. In it no one is immature: all are apt to > learn: none can force a way into it by violence, or deceive it by craft. Nothing is known of the later career of Jovinian. From a remark in St. Jerome's work Against Vigilantius, written in 409, that he \\"amidst pheasants and pork rather belched out than breathed out his life\\", it is inferred by some (who assume Jerome to speaking from authoritative knowledge and not merely in his usual highly rhetorical mode of vituperation) that he was then dead, and had not been made to suffer for his views too strenuously. In fact, penalties of quite a cruel nature were often meted out upon heretics during the reign of Theodosius, and legal records at the time show that the Roman state did prescribe cruel punishments for him, including flogging and (supposing he survived) exile \\"...to the Isle of Bua\\" in the Adriatic Sea. It is worth noting in this regard that Augustine, in a relatively recently discovered letter (10*), laments the use of the leaded thong on heretics, since, in the Saint's words, \\"...it so often leads to death.\\" Teachings The writings of Jovinian were sent to Jerome by his friend Pammachius. Jerome replied to them in a long treatise in two books, written in 393. Many of Jovinian's views could be considered contrary to ascetic ideals that were gaining prominence in the era, and would ultimately influence what constitutes orthodoxy today. He felt that virgins, widows and married women, even remarried widows, are of equal merit in the Christian community. Jovinian addressed his virginal reader: > I do you no wrong, Virgin: you have chosen a life of chastity on account of > the present distress: you determined on the course in order to be holy in > body and spirit: be not proud: you and your married sisters are members of > the same Church‚Ä¶Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: > but I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be > faithful. I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present > distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is‚Ä¶ See, the Apostle > confesses that as regards virgins he has no commandment of the Lord, and he > who had with authority laid down the law respecting husbands and wives, does > not dare to command what the Lord has not enjoined. And rightly too. For > what is enjoined is commanded, what is commanded must be done, and that > which must be done implies punishment if it be not done. For it is useless > to order a thing to be done and yet leave the individual free to do it or > not do it. If the Lord had commanded virginity He would have seemed to > condemn marriage, and to do away with the seed-plot of mankind, of which > virginity itself is a growth. If He had cut off the root, how was He to > expect fruit ? If the foundations were not first laid, how was He to build > the edifice, and put on the roof to cover all ! Excavators toil hard to > remove mountains; the bowels of the earth are pierced in the search for > gold. And, when the tiny particles, first by the blast of the furnace, then > by the hand of the cunning workman have been fashioned into an ornament, men > do not call him blessed who has separated the gold from the dross but him > who wears the beautiful gold.

Jovinian also maintained that abstinence is no better than the partaking of food in the right disposition. Looking back into the creation, Jovinian stated that God gave dominion to humanity over the creation. After the great flood, God allowed humanity to take food not only from plants, but also from animals. St. Paul in the New Testament also teaches that all food is clean if they are eaten with thankfulness (Romans 14:20)Wren, C. M., Jr. (2013, May 01).

Another point that Jovinian argues is, \\"they who with full assurance of faith have been born again in baptism, cannot be overthrown by the devil.\\" As Jerome critiques in his treatise, Jerome alters the word \\"overthrown\\" with \\"tempted\\" Jerome, Against Jovinian, 2.1, 387. Jerome‚Äôs original wording is almost certainly an accurate record of Jovinian‚Äôs words. David Hunter argues that Jerome either did not understand Jovinian‚Äôs point about baptism, or by altering the wording he allowed himself to take on an issue he could easily refute, even if it was not exactly what Jovinian was teaching. See Hunter, Marriage, Celibacy, and Heresy in Ancient Christianity, 36. Jerome‚Äôs paraphrase of ‚Äúoverthrown‚Äù surely indicates an unwillingness to deal with the essential issues raised by Jovinian in this proposition.. This may show that either Jermone missed a point that Jovinian was making, as his argument on this point was much shorter. The word \\"overthrow\\" may have indicated much more significance than a believer committing sin since Jovinian believed that a believer was able to sin after the baptism. He wrote that if they do sin, they must repent. Rather, Jovinian seems to have been arguing that something significant occurs in the life of the believer when he or she is baptized, something that goes beyond peccability Wren, C. M., Jr. (2013, May 01). Marriage, Celibacy, and the Hierarchy of Merit in the Jovinian Controversy. Retrieved May 05, 2020, from https://www.sbts.edu/family/2013/05/01/marriage- celibacy-and-the-hierarchy-of-merit-in-the-jovinian-controversy/. This quote reveals a concern not simply over the presence of sin, but over the future state of believers. Jovinian evidently argued that baptism, administered ‚Äúwith full assurance of faith,‚Äù places believers in a state in which the blessings they experience as a result are not diminished by the presence of sin. In other words, Jovinian argued for what historian David Hunter called the final indefectibility of believers rather than their personal impeccability Hunter, idem, 36-37.. Those who are baptized into the Church are in a permanent state of grace. The fourth proposition stated is, \\"there is one reward in the kingdom of heaven for all who have kept their baptismal vow.\\" Referencing Matthew 25:31-46 about sheep and goats, the judgment of humanity through the flood, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Jovinian stated, ‚ÄúThere is one salvation for those who are released, one destruction for those who stay behind‚Äù Jovinian, quoted in Jerome, Against Jovinianus, 2.18, in St. Jerome: Letters and Select Works, 402.. Jovinian rejected the idea that believers should be divided into classes, some more spiritual than others, because the New Testament repeatedly emphasizes that all believers partake of the body and blood of Christ ( John 6:56), that the Holy Spirit indwells all believers (1 Cor 6:19), and that the Church itself is one. For these reasons, the common teaching that an ascetic lifestyle produces greater reward should be rejected. All believers possess the presence of Christ and are part of the same body. Therefore all experience the same reward Wren, C. M., Jr. (2013, May 01). Marriage, Celibacy, and the Hierarchy of Merit in the Jovinian Controversy. Retrieved May 05, 2020, from https://www.sbts.edu/family/2013/05/01/marriage- celibacy-and-the-hierarchy-of-merit-in-the-jovinian-controversy/. From a letter of the synod at Milan to Pope Siricius (Ambrose, Epistle xlii) and from Augustine's book Contra Julian. ii, it is clear that Jovinian also denied the perpetual virginity of Mary. The counter of St. Jerome to this \\"Epicurus of Christianity\\" took a whole book to praise virginity and disparage the state of marriage, based upon Paul's remarks in 1 Corinthians 7. The work was couched in abusive and intemperate language that appalled Pammachius, who found it excessive in its praise of virginity and in depreciation of marriage. Jerome did not approve of democratic distribution of bliss in the life to come: > Perhaps those who have been married twice or thrice ought not to complain, > for the same whoremonger if penitent is made equal in the kingdom of heaven > even to virgins. Efforts to suppress it failed, however, and St. Jerome's work obtained a wide circulation. Chaucer mentions Jovinian with scorn in the \\"Summoner's Tale\\" of his Canterbury Tales, lines 221-3: > ...lyke Iouinian > Fat as a whale and walkynge as a swan > As vinolent as botel in the spence >  See also  *Antidicomarianites *Bonosians *Helvidius References * Hunter, David G., \\"Rereading the Jovinianist Controversy: Ascetism and Clerical Authority in Late Ancient Christianity,\\" in Dale B.

It has a western terminus near Osseo on M-99 and runs through forest and farm lands to its eastern terminus at Business US Highway 223 (BUS US 223) and M-52 in Adrian. The highway serves a number of smaller communities in the area and intersects two US Highways while carrying between 4,200 and 11,300 vehicles on a daily basis. M-34 was designated and signed with the beginning of the state highway system around July 1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area. Route description M-34 begins at an intersection with M-99 just west of Osseo. M-99 approaches Osseo from the west along Hudson Road and where M-99 turns south along Pioneer Road, M-34 continues east along Hudson Road. The highway turns to the southeast to the south of Osseo near Deer Lake and continues towards Pittsford. Hudson Road runs through a mix of forests and local farms. The trunkline passes to the south of the main business district in Pittsford. East of town, the highway turns east and intersects US Highway 127 (US 127) at the Hillsdale‚ÄìLenawee county line in Hudson. The trunkline continues eastward through the city of Hudson as Main Street. On the eastern edge of town, it becomes Carleton Road and passes through more farmland. Just south of Clayton, M-34 has a junction with the northern terminus of M-156, a connector highway that runs south into Ohio and US 20. M-34 eastern terminus, Adrian Approximately four miles (6.4 km) east of that junction, M-34 turns north for about two miles (3.2 km) along Benner Highway and passes through the community of Cadmus. At the end of its course along Benner Highway, M-34 turns east towards Adrian on Beecher Road. There are some residential subdivisions along the road on the southwest side of Adrian. M-34 intersects Industrial Drive and crosses US 223 and Beecher Road becomes Beecher Street in town. The trunkline continues east and terminates at the intersection of Beecher and Main streets where it meets BUS US 223/M-52. M-34 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-34 were the 11,302 vehicles daily immediately east of the BUS US 223/M-52 junction in Adrian; the lowest counts were the 4,166 vehicles per day between Hudson and the M-156 junction. No section of M-34 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History When the state highway system was signed around July 1, 1919, M-34 started in Jonesville at an intersection with M-23 along the present-day alignment of M-99. The highway ran to Adrian along its present route and continued southeasterly along present-day US 223 through Blissfield, where it terminated at the Ohio state line near Sylvania, Ohio. In 1924, the western terminus of the highway was extended to Homer where it terminated at M-60. Just a few years later, in 1926, the western terminus was truncated, to end at Hillsdale, with the remainder to Jonesville becoming an extension of the M-64 of the day. At the same time, the eastern segment of M-34 from Adrian to the border was assumed into the US 127 corridor, therefore, scaling the terminus back to US 127 (now US 223). In 1954, a new US 223 bypass was built around Adrian, resulting in the relocation of M-34 to end at BUS US 223/M-52. Finally, in 1966, when a new alignment of M-99 highway was opened, the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo. In 2003, the short connector between M-34 and US 223 was abandoned and obliterated. Industrial Drive, which is known internally at MDOT as Connector 34, is a new connector between the two highways that was assumed into the state trunkline system at the same time.

It has been acknowledged by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site of mixed cultural and natural values. Tongariro National Park was the sixth national park established in the world. The active volcanic mountains Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe, and Tongariro are located in the centre of the park. There are a number of MƒÅori religious sites within the park, and many of the park's summits, including Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu, are tapu, or sacred. The park includes many towns around its boundary including Ohakune, Waiouru, Horopito, Pokaka, Erua, National Park Village, Whakapapa skifield and Turangi. The Tongariro National Park is home to the famed Tongariro Alpine Crossing, widely regarded as one of the world's best one-day hikes. Tongariro Alpine Crossing  Geography   Location  Tongariro National Park covers 786 km2 stretching between 175¬∞ 22' and 175¬∞ 48' East and 38¬∞ 58' and 39¬∞ 25' South in the heart of the North Island of New Zealand. It is just a few kilometres west-southwest of Lake Taupo. It is 330 km south of Auckland by road, and 320 km north of Wellington. It contains a considerable part of the North Island Volcanic Plateau. Directly to the east stand the hills of the Kaimanawa range. The Whanganui River rises within the park and flows through Whanganui National Park to the west. Most of the park is located in the Ruapehu District (Manawat≈´-Whanganui region), although the northeast is in the Taupo District (Waikato Region, or Hawke's Bay Region to the north).  Dimension  Satellite picture of Tongariro National Park Tongariro National Park stretches around the massif of the three active volcanoes Mount Ruapehu, Mount Ngauruhoe, and Mount Tongariro. The Pihanga Scenic Reserve, containing Lake Rotopounamu, Mount Pihanga and the Kakaramea- Tihia Massif, though separate from the main park area, is still part of the national park. On the park borders are the towns of Turangi, National Park Village and Ohakune. Further away are Waiouru and Raetihi. Within the park borders, the only settlements are the tourism-based village at Whakapapa Village which consists solely of ski accommodation. Two Maori kainga (settlements) Papakai and Otukou are not part of the park but lie on the shores of Lake Rotoaira between the Pihanga Scenic Reserve and the main park area. The bulk of Tongariro National Park is surrounded by well-maintained roads that roughly follow the park borders and provide easy access. In the west, State Highway 4 passes National Park village, and in the east, State Highway 1, known for this stretch as the Desert Road, runs parallel to the Tongariro River. State Highway 47 joins these two highways to the north of much of the park, although it bisects the Pihanga Scenic Reserve. The southern link is State Highway 49. The North Island Main Trunk railway from Auckland to Wellington passes National Park village.  Climate  Tawhai Falls, Jan 2014 Like the whole of New Zealand, Tongariro National Park is situated in a temperate zone. The prevailing westerly winds gather water over the Tasman Sea. As the volcanoes of Tongariro National Park are the first significant elevations that these winds encounter on the North Island, besides Mount Taranaki, rain falls almost daily. The east‚Äìwest rainfall differences are not as great as in the Southern Alps, because the three volcanoes do not belong to a greater mountain range, but there is still a noticeable rain shadow effect with the Rangipo desert on the Eastern leeward side receiving 1,000 mm of annual rainfall. At Whakapapa Village (1119 m) the average annual rainfall is about 2200 mm, in Ohakune (610 m) about 1250 mm and in higher altitudes, such as Iwikau Village (1770 m), about 4900 mm. In winter there is snow to about 1500 m. Temperatures vary dramatically, even within one day. In Whakapapa, they can fall below the freezing point all year round. The average temperature is 13 ¬∞C, with a maximum of 25 ¬∞C in summer and a minimum of -10 ¬∞C in winter. In some summers the summits of the three volcanoes are covered with snow; on top of Mount Ruapehu, snow fields can be found every summer and the summit is glaciated.  History  The three volcanoes: snow-capped Ruapehu (left), conical Ngauruhoe (centre) and broad-domed Tongariro (right) Tongariro deed of gift between Te Heuheu T≈´kino IV of NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa and the Crown (1887) The mountain summits are of great significance to the local MƒÅori. In 1886 in order to prevent the selling of the mountains to European settlers, the local Ngati Tuwharetoa iwi had the mountains surveyed in the Native Land Court and then set aside (whakatapua) as a reserve in the names of certain chiefs one of whom was Te Heuheu Tukino IV (Horonuku), the most significant chief of the MƒÅori Ngati Tuwharetoa iwi. Later the peaks of Mount Tongariro, Mount Ngauruhoe, and parts of Mount Ruapehu, were conveyed to The Crown on 23 September 1887, on condition that a protected area was established there. This 26.4 km2 area was generally considered to be too small to establish a national park after the model of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States, and so further areas were acquired. When the New Zealand Parliament passed the Tongariro National Park Act in October 1894, the park covered an area of about 252.13 km2, but it took until 1907 to acquire the land. When the Act was renewed in 1922, the park area was extended to 586.8 km2. Further extensions, especially Pihanga Scenic Reserve in 1975, enlarged the park to its current size of 786.23 km2. The last modification to the Act was passed in 1980. Tongariro National Park has been under the control of the New Zealand Department of Conservation since the creation of the department in 1987. The first activities in the young Tongariro National Park were the construction of tourist huts at the beginning of the 20th century. But it was not before opening of the railway in 1908 and the building of roads in the 1930s that a significant number of people visited the park. The second Tongariro National Park Act, in 1922, started some active conservation efforts, but it was not until 1931 that the first permanent park ranger began work. Road construction into Whakapapa valley had already begun in the 1920s. The first ski hut was built in 1923 at an elevation of 1770 m, thereafter a road, and, in 1938, a ski lift in the area. This early tourist development explains the rather uncommon existence of a permanently inhabited village and fully developed ski area within a national park. The hotel Chateau Tongariro, which is still the centre of Whakapapa today, was established in 1929. In the early 20th century, park administrators introduced heather to the park, for grouse hunting. Grouse were never actually introduced, but the heather is sprawling, threatening the ecological system and endemic plants of the park. Efforts are being made to control the plant's spread, however complete eradication seems unlikely. Sunrise on Tongariro National Park Panorama of Mount Ruapehu and Mount Ngauruhoe looking west from the Desert Road in January 2015 Tongariro Power Scheme The Tongariro Power Scheme was designed to preserve and protect the natural surroundings as much as possible. It gathers water from the mountains of the central volcanic plateau, passes it through Rangipo (120MW) and Tokaanu (240MW) power stations, and releases it into Lake Taupo. The scheme taps a catchment area of more than 2600 km2 and uses a series of lakes, canals and tunnels to take water to the two stations which typically generate 1400 GWh pa,. about four percent of the country's total electricity generation. The extra catchment increases the volume of water going into Lake Taupo and down the Waikato River by 20%. The western diversion takes water from six rivers and streams from the Whakapapa River to the Whanganui River, into Lake Rotoaira via Lake Otamangakau. The Tokaanu power station is connected to Lake Rotoaira via a six kilometre tunnel through Mount Tihia. It also draws water from the Tongariro River via the Poutu tunnel and canal. On the eastern side of Mount Ruapehu, water is diverted from the Kaimanawa Ranges and headwaters of the Wahianoa River through a 20 km tunnel into the Rangipo dam. The 120MW Rangipo power station is 230 m below ground. Its turbines are located in a cavern cut from solid rock and lined with concrete. Genesis Energy has developed mitigation measures with stakeholders that aim to lessen the environmental effects of the Tongariro Power Scheme. Some of these measures include lake level management, ecological monitoring programmes, and agreements with local iwi to establish a process for iwi involvement in environmental monitoring and access to information. The electricity generated at the Tongariro Power Scheme goes into the national grid. Then it is distributed to residential, commercial and industrial customers throughout New Zealand.  Geology  The park's volcanoes are the southern end of a 2500 km long range of volcanoes, below which the Australian Plate meets the Pacific Plate. These volcanoes have resulted from internal tectonic processes. The Pacific Plate subducts under the Australian plate, and subsequently melts due to the high temperatures of the aesthenosphere. This magma being less dense, rises to the surface and goes through the weak parts of the Earth's crust (the faults) resulting in volcanic processes in the area. Volcanic processes have been building the mountains of Tongariro National Park for over two million years. Three volcanoes (Tongariro, Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu) remain active, while the park's two northernmost volcanoes (Pihanga and the Kakaramea-Tihia Massif) last erupted over 20,000 years ago. They have however produced significant historic mudflows. A glaciated valley on the southeast side of Mount Ruapehu Erosion and deposition by mountain glaciers has also played an important role in shaping Tongariro and Ruapehu volcanoes. Small glaciers are present on the summit of Mt. Ruapehu today, however there is abundant geomorphological evidence for more extensive glaciation in the recent geological past. Glaciers were last present on Tongariro during the Last Glacial Maximum.  Biology  Southern beech forest on the slopes of Mount Ruapehu Flora The Tongariro National Park is a rough and partly unstable environment. To the north and west of the park, a podocarp-broadleaf rain forest near Lake Taupo stretches over an area of 30 km2, and up to an elevation of 1000 m. In this rain forest live Hall's totara (Podocarpus laetus), kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides), kamahi (Weinmannia racemosa), pahautea (Libocedrus bidwillii), and numerous epiphytic ferns, orchids, and fungi. Pahautea trees can be found further on up to a height of 1530 m, where they cover 127.3 km2. On this level, one can also find a 50 km2 beech forest, containing red (Nothofagus fusca), silver (Nothofagus menziesii) and mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var cliffortioides). Understory species within the forests include ferns such as crown fern (Blechnum discolor) as well as shrub species.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Crown Fern: Blechnum discolor, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg There is also a 95 km2 area of scrubland, containing kanuka (Leptospermum ericoides), manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), celery-top pine (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius), inaka (Dracophyllum longifolium), woolly fringe moss (Rhacomitrium lanuginosum), small beeches and introduced heather. Rhododendron at Tongariro National Park To the northwest, and around Mount Ruapehu, between an altitude of 1200 and 1500 m, tussock shrubland and tussock grass covers large areas (around 150 km2), consisting mainly of New Zealand red tussock grass (Chionochloa rubra), inaka, curled leaved neinei (Dracophyllum recurvum), wire rush (Empodisma minus), and bog rush (Schoenus pauciflorus), as well as heather and grasses like hard tussock (Festuca novaezelandiae) and bluegrass (Poa colensoi). Above 1500 m, the terrain consists of gravel and stone fields and is accordingly unstable. Nevertheless, some plants occasionally settle there, such as curled leaved neinei, snow totara (Podocarpus nivalis), mountain snowberry (Gaultheria colensoi), bristle tussock (Rytidosperma setifolium), bluegrass and Raoulia albosericea, which cover an area of 165 km2. Between 1700 and 2020 m there are some isolated Parahebe species, Gentiana bellidifolia and buttercups. Above 2200 m live only crustose lichens. Fauna There are 56 significant species of birds, such as rare endemic species like the North Island brown kiwi, kƒÅkƒÅ, blue duck, North Island fernbird (Bowdleria punctata vealeae), double-banded plover and New Zealand falcon/kƒÅrearea. Other bird species common to the park are tui, New Zealand bellbird, morepork/ruru, grey warbler/riroriro, fantail, whitehead/p≈çpokotea and silvereye. The park also features the only two native mammals of New Zealand, the short and long tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata and Chalinolobus tuberculatus). The Tongariro National Park also teems with insects like moths and wƒìtƒÅ. Also present in the park, as well as the whole of New Zealand, are animals introduced by Europeans, such as black rats, stoats, cats, rabbits, hare, possums and red deer. Activities Ruapehu seen from Whakapapa Village, Tongariro National Park. This road climbs to Iwikau Village, which provides access to ski fields. The main activities are hiking and climbing in summer, and skiing and snowboarding in winter. There is also opportunity for hunting, game fishing, mountain biking, horse riding, rafting and scenic flights. Mount Tongariro and its surroundings are one of the several locations where Peter Jackson shot The Lord of the Rings film trilogy; tours to view these places are commonly arranged by the tour's operators and lodges. The most popular track in Tongariro National Park is the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Most of the track is also part of the Tongariro Northern Circuit, a two- to four-day tour, which is one of New Zealand's nine Great Walks. Side trips to the summits of Mount Tongariro and Mount Ngauruhoe are possible on these tracks. Another route is the three- to six-day Round the Mountain Track around Mount Ruapehu. Besides these, there are numerous shorter tracks appropriate for day tramps. With this track net, three camp sites, two emergency shelters, nine public and four private huts and the facilities in Whakapapa, the park is well developed for tourism. These tracks also serve as winter routes, as well as the track to the summit of Mount Ruapehu. Rock- climbing is also an option. Snow season is from late June to early November. The biggest ski area, also called Whakapapa, is on the north-western slopes of Mount Ruapehu. It has 15 lifts, covering an area of 5.5 km2. Directly next to the ski field are 47 ski club huts; most of them also accommodate non-club members. The next settlement is on the bottom, in Whakapapa. A slightly smaller ski field called Turoa is on the south-western slope. Though it has only nine lifts, the skiing area, of 5 km2, is almost as large as Whakapapa's. There is no accommodation at the ski field; the nearest town is Ohakune. These two ski fields came under common management in 2000. Ski passes can be used on both fields, and a lift or run from one field to the other is planned. Beside these major ski fields, there are also the Tukino ski area, privately run by the Desert Alpine Ski Club, and the Aorangi Ski Club on the south-eastern slope. It has two nutcracker rope tows, and covers 1.9 km2. View of Mt.

She has appeared in several soap operas, including Another World and All My Children. In 1986, she won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for her work as twins Marley and Vicky Love Hudson on Another World. In 1988, she won another Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her work as Cindy Parker Chandler on All My Children. Wheeler's character was one of the first characters with AIDS on daytime television. Wheeler also made a memorable guest appearance as Phyllis Wicke in the 1991 primetime revival of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows. In 1996, she starred in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode, \\"The Quickening\\". In 1998, she briefly reprised the role of Marley on Another World. Rather than have the same actress play the role of both twins, the show made the decision to have Wheeler, the first actress to play the twins, portray Marley, and have actress Jensen Buchanan continue to play Vicky; their differences in appearance (other than a considerable height and build difference which were never addressed) were explained by plastic surgery after Marley was disfigured in a fire. Wheeler was once married to her Another World costar, Tom Eplin. They were married during the time that their characters Vicky/Marley and Jake were involved. Directing and producing During the final season of Another World, Wheeler drew on her stage directorial experience and was invited by AW's executive producer, Chris Goutman, to direct a few episodes of the show. After the cancellation of Another World in 1999, she continued her focus on directing. While continuing to act, she directed several episodes of As the World Turns and finally became part of the directorial team at As the World Turns. After two seasons with ATWT, Wheeler worked as an associate producer at another Procter & Gamble serial, Guiding Light. She returned to ATWT and directed episodes of the show for several years, until she was appointed executive producer of Guiding Light in April 2004, a position she would hold until the final episode of the show in September 2009. Under her direction, the show named a new head writer, David Kreizman, and in 2008, she created a four- person head writing team; in addition to Kreizman, that team includes Lucky Gold, Chris Dunn and executive story editor (and eventual head writer) Jill Lorie Hurst. Wheeler is credited with Guiding Light's transition to a new filming method. The show moved away from traditional three-camera filming in a \\"proscenium\\" stage setting, and in early 2008 began to broadcast episodes that were recorded on digital cameras. The show rebuilt smaller, more realistic sets in its studio and utilized several other interior and exterior sets in a New Jersey town (adjacent to New York City, where GL is produced). In 2007, Wheeler launched Guiding Light's 70th anniversary (the longest running show in history) by volunteering her cast and crew on a charity and service campaign known as \\"Find Your Light\\", encouraging viewers to participate alongside actors, directors and crew members in work for the homeless and other deserving groups and individuals across the country. Despite Wheeler's efforts to save the show, CBS cancelled the program on April 1, 2009. The final episode was broadcast on September 18, 2009.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/arts/television/02ligh.html  Glenn Beck collaboration  In 2015, Glenn Beck announced that Wheeler would be working with him to create and produce content.https://www.glennbeck.com/2015/10/12/meet-ellen-wheeler-glenns-new- hire-to-help-tell-stories-inspiring-people-to-change-the-world/ A 2016 article identified Wheeler as a programming director for Beck's streaming channel, Blaze TV.https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/03/09/theblaze-tv-launches- campaign-to-replace-failed-al-jazeera-america-network Personal life Wheeler is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Running for about in a general north-south direction, connecting rural portions of DeKalb and Steuben counties. SR 327 was originally introduced in the early 1930s routed between Garrett and Corunna. The road was extended north to the Michigan state line in the mid-1930s. In the late 1960s the road was extended south to the city of Fort Wayne. This extension didn't last by the mid-1970s the southern end of SR 327 was truncated to its current location at SR 205. Route description The Fawn River State Fish Hatchery, a mile north of Orland, is on the National Register of Historic Places. SR 327 starts at an all-way stop with SR 205, and two DeKalb county roads. It heads north as a two-lane highway passing through farmland. The route enters Garrett, concurrent with Randolph Street, and passes through a mix of commercial and residential properties. The highway passes through the Garrett Historic District, a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While in the historic district the road passes through the central business district before passing under CSX Railroad tracks. North of the railroad tracks the route leaves the historic district, while passes through residential properties. On the north side of Garrett SR 327 has a four-way stop at SR 8 before the road leaves Garrett. North of Garrett the road makes a sharp curve turning due west. The road has a second sharp curve turning back due north and heads towards Corunna. The route enter Corunna from the south and passes through residential properties. The highway passes over the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks and has an intersection at U.S. Route 6 (US 6). SR 327 turns west concurrent with US 6 as a two-lane highway, passing through commercial properties. After leaving Corunna, SR 327 turns north leaving US 6 and heads towards Helmer, the landscape becomes farms and fields. South of Helmer the road bends towards the west before curving towards the north and having an intersection with the western terminus of the eastern segment of SR 4\\\\. After SR 4 the road enters Helmer and crosses an Indiana Northeastern Railroad track. North of the railroad tracks the road passes through residential properties, before leaving Helmer. Past Helmer the route passes through rural farmland and an intersection at US 20\\\\. The highway enters Orland and passes through residential properties with a few commercial properties. After leaving Orland SR 327 passes Fawn River State Fish Hatchery, while passing through agriculture. South of the Michigan state line SR 327 passes under the Indiana Toll Road, before the SR 327 designation ends at the state line. While the SR 327 designation end at the state line the roadway continues north into Michigan as Rierson Road. No part of SR 327 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other State Roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state roads as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. Between 2014 and 2015, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 748 vehicles used the highway daily between Indiana Toll Road and Michigan state line. The peak traffic volumes were 7,956 vehicles AADT along the section of SR 327 at its concurrency with US 6. History SR 327 had its beginning in 1931 when it was designated from Garrett to Corunna. The route between Corunna and the Michigan state line was authorized in 1934. DeKalb County purchased the right-of-way for the road between Corunna and Helmer in 1935. The state highway commission constructed the section of road, between US 6 and Michigan state line, in 1936. During 1969 SR 327 was extended south to Interstate 69 in Fort Wayne, along former US 27. The entire roadway was paved between 1970 and 1971. The state highway commission truncated SR 327 south of Garrett at an intersection with SR 205 between 1974 and 1975.

It was established in 1987 and encompasses 430 km2 (166 sq mi). The park ranges from on or near the coastline to the peak of the Paparoa Ranges. A separate section of the park lies to the north and is centered at Ananui Creek. The park protects a limestone karst area. The park contains several caves, of which Metro Cave / Te Ananui Cave is a commercial tourist attraction. The majority of the park is forested with a wide variety of vegetation. The park was the site of the 1995 Cave Creek disaster where fourteen people died as a result of the collapse of a scenic viewing platform. The Paparoa Track, one of New Zealand's Great Walks, runs through the park. The small settlement of Punakaiki, adjacent to the Pancake Rocks tourist attraction, lies on the edge of the park. The park is also located near the towns of Westport, Greymouth, and Barrytown. History of establishment In 1976, the Federated Mountain Clubs had identified the northern part of the Paparoa Ranges as a potential wilderness area. In 1979, the Native Forest Action Council proposed a 130,000 hectare national park, including the northern Paparoa Ranges and land to the north and east. This eventually led to the National Parks and Reserves Authority identifying the western Paparoa Range as a prospective national park. Meanwhile, a joint proposal by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the National Museum succeeded in having a core area of great ecological significance - the forests of the lowland karst syncline - gazetted as the Pororari Ecological Area in 1979. The initial proposal for a large park incorporating the wilderness area was rejected, but after seven rounds of submissions, and help from other environment groups including the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society, an area of 30,327 hectares was gazetted as Paparoa National Park on 23 November 1987. Landforms The park has diverse geology and a variety of landforms including mountain, lowlands and coastal terrain. Mountains More than half the park is best described as mountainous, from the eastern edge of the syncline to the crest of the main range. On their eastern side, an assortment of hanging valleys, truncated spurs, towering bluffs and cirques overlook deep glaciated valleys running north and south. The predominant ancient granite and gneiss rocks of the Paparoa mountains bear a closer geological resemblance to those in distant Fiordland than to the main range of the Southern Alps. This is because the Alpine Fault has separated them from their original neighbours over the last 10 million years. Karst Cave Creek resurgence Rivers flowing from the Paparoa Ranges pass through the limestone syncline, creating subterranean waterways and extensive cave systems that are one of the features of the park. The main rivers are the Fox, Pororari and Punakaiki. Another of the rivers is Cave Creek, site of the 1995 Cave Creek disaster. The river gorges, confined by high, forest-crowned limestone cliffs, provide a means of access to the park's karst interior. However, in many of the tributaries the gorges are narrow, steep and include waterfalls. Dry, mossy streambeds, karren, sinkholes (or dolines), blind valleys and basins where water emerges from caves or vanishes into sinks are all indicators of the complex subterranean system beneath. Intricate systems of shafts, passages and caverns have been slowly formed by the continual effects of water through the soluble limestone. The forest ensures that this process continues by supplying decaying vegetation to add to the acidity in the flowing water. The largest single feature in the karst region is the Barrytown Syncline. Limestone is exposed on both flanks of the syncline with more recent gravels and mudstones occupying the low-lying area in between. These more easily erodible rocks overlie interstratal karst. The majority of known cave systems are in the western side of the limestone syncline where underground drainage patterns are concentrated mainly along horizontal lines of weakness in the bedding planes. Coastal region The \\"Pancake Rocks\\" at Paparoa National Park The \\"Pancake Rocks\\" at Paparoa National Park The Paparoa coastline is characterised by high cliffs cut away by waves from the Tasman Sea, with indented coves and sandy beaches. There are small islands off shore and rock pillars. These terraces were once islands, which became part of the mainland when New Zealand was uplifted quite recently in its geological history. The most well known feature of the coastal region is the \\"pancake rocks\\" at Dolomite Point, near Punakaiki, where evenly layered stacks of platey limestone have been eroded in places to form surge pools and blowholes. Wildlife Bird habitats within the park range from on or near the coastline to the peak of the Paparoa Ranges. Several species such as tui, bellbird, kaka, New Zealand pigeon and parakeets migrate from winter habitat in the lower forests to summer habitat in the upland forests. A significant feature of the coast is the colony of the rare seabird, the Westland petrel or tƒÅiko, that is located on densely forested terraces just south of Punakaiki river. The Westland petrel breeding site at Punakaiki has been identified as an Important Bird Area, by BirdLife International.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Punakaiki.

Protection from mining Although Paparoa National Park is protected from mining by Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act, there have been proposals to allow some mining within the park's borders. On 22 March 2010, the Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee and Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson released a discussion paper including a proposal to remove 7,058 hectares of land from Schedule Four of the Crown Minerals Act 1991, including the Inangahua sector of Paparoa National Park. The area of the Inangahua sector included in this proposal was 3,315 hectares, or 8 per cent of the park. The proposed change would remove the prohibition on mining for the area concerned. On 26 March 2010, a spokesman for Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee said that opencast mining in Paparoa National Park could not be ruled out. On 20 July 2010, in a joint statement by Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee and Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson, the Government announced that it had received 37,552 submissions on its discussion paper, and that it had decided not to remove any land from Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act for the purposes of further mineral exploration or extraction. Ms Wilkinson said the government had agreed to continue with its proposal to add 14 areas with a total of 12,400 hectares of land to Schedule 4, including 240 hectares of Paparoa National Park (the northwest addition).  Addition to Park, Paparoa Track and Pike29 Memorial Track  Following the liquidation of Pike River Coal, Solid Energy purchased the assets of the company . The government then purchased the 3580 ha of land around the Pike River Mine. The environment minister, Nick Smith, announced on 15 November 2015 that the 3,580 ha of land was to be added to the Park. A 55 km walkway, the Paparoa Track from Blackball to Punakaikai and the Pike29 Memorial Track were constructed through the park as a memorial to the 29 miners lost in the 2010 Pike River Mine disaster. Most of the families of the victims approved, but there has been some criticism because Solid Energy decided in 2014 that it was too risky to re-enter the mine to recover any remains from the mine. The formation of the Paparoa Track has been a catalyst for the emerging adventure sports community on the West Coast with events such as The Paparoa which features trail running and mountain biking over the track. The event is based around the regions mining history and also celebrates the number of exceptional female adventure athletes the region has produced such as Casey Brown, Ruth Croft and Emily Miazga.

The community lies on the edge of the Paparoa National Park. The Pancake Rocks are a very popular tourist destination at Dolomite Point south of the main village.  Geology  The Pancake Rocks are a heavily eroded limestone area where the sea bursts through several vertical blowholes during high tides. Together with the 'pancake'-layering of the limestone (created by immense pressure on alternating hard and soft layers of marine creatures and plant sediments),Punakaiki Pancake Rocks and Blowholes (from the New Zealand Department of Conservation website) these form the main attraction of the area. The base of the limestone was laid down and formed between 25 million and 35 million years ago. Stylobedding is the name given to the process which formed the pancake layering. The current theory on how this happens is that following the limestone being buried up to kilometre below the seabed, it comes under pressure dissolution and the thinner layers of mud between the limestone are dissolved more quickly than the limestone, when exposed. This leaves the effect of the Pancake Rock layers.  Wildlife and Conservation  Located on the edge of the Paparoa National Park, Punakaiki has a diverse range of birdlife and marine wildlife. Fur seals are seen on the rocks and Hector's dolphins close to the shore. Birds seen in the area include blue penguin, blue shag, black shag, Australasian gannet, white-faced heron, weka, kerer≈´, tui, bellbird, fantail, grey warbler, and tomtit. The Westland petrel has its only mainland breeding colonies close by on the Barrytown flats. These colonies were established in the middle of the 18th century. Limestone caves in the Punakaiki area preserved animal fossils dating back 25,000 years which help us visualize the fauna of the Otira Glaciation period. This fauna includes a variety of large and smalls (including moas), amphibians, reptiles, and potentially bats. Local conservation efforts including the Punakaiki Coastal Restoration Project which was started by the Department of Conservation, aluminum production company Rio Tinto, and Conservation Volunteers in 2009. The Project cover 40 ha. 4 km south of Punakaiki and is managed to restore the Sand Forest Flats and provide a forest to sea corridor. The land is owned by the Department of Conservation and includes the last remaining Westland petrel breeding site on mainland New Zealand.

The ABN was introduced on 1 July 2000 by John Howard's Liberal government as part of a major tax reform, which included the introduction of a GST. The law requires each entity that carries on a business in Australia has an ABN and that the ABN appear on each tax invoice and other tax related documents issued by the entity. Australian Business Register The Australian Business Register (ABR) is maintained by the Registrar of the ABR, who is also the Commissioner of Taxation.Section 28 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth). The Registrar registers entities, issuing them with an ABN,Section 11 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth). while the Commissioner of Taxation issues the entity a tax file number. Entitlement to an ABN The Registrar issues ABNs only to entities that are entitled to an ABN,Section 8 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth). which can be: * an individual, * a body corporate, * a corporation sole, * a body politic, * a partnership, * any other unincorporated association or body of persons, * a trust, or * a superannuation fund.Subsection 184-1(1) of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth). For an entity to be entitled to an ABN, it must: * carry on an enterprise in Australia,Paragraph 8(1)(a) of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth). or * carry on an enterprise that makes supplies connected with Australia,Paragraph 8(1)(b) of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth). or * be a company registered under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).Subsection 8(1) of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth). Whether or not an entity is carrying on an enterprise is a question of fact and there are many circumstances where an entity will be carrying on an enterprise. Without being exhaustive, an entity will be carrying on an enterprise if it: * is in the form of a business, * leases property, * is a religious institution, * is a superannuation fund, * is an arm of the government, or * is a charity.Section 9-20 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth). The Registrar can refuse an entity's application to be registered.Section 13 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth). Equally, the Registrar can cancel an entity's registration and thus their ABN.Section 18 of the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 (Cth). Each of these decisions are reviewable taxation decisions. Applying for an ABN An entity can apply for an ABN: * online through the Australian Business Register portal, * using the services of a registered tax agent, or * lodging a paper-based application with the ATO. Before applying for an ABN the entity must have a tax file number (TFN). Format of the ABN The ABN is an 11-digit number where the first two digits are a checksum. Unlike with the tax file number (TFN), the ATO has publicised the formula for checking and creating valid ABN checksums. Also, the nature of the ABN algorithm means that any 9-digit number can be made into a valid ABN. In the case of companies, the ATO determines the ABN by using the company's Australian Company Number (ACN) to which the two-digit checksum is prefixed.

It is based on the use of statistical tools like linear regression and enables empirical research similar to that performed in other fields, such as social science. While the tools and order used in Six Sigma require a process to be in place and functioning, DFSS has the objective of determining the needs of customers and the business, and driving those needs into the product solution so created. DFSS is relevant for relatively simple items / systems. It is used for product or process design in contrast with process improvement. Measurement is the most important part of most Six Sigma or DFSS tools, but whereas in Six Sigma measurements are made from an existing process, DFSS focuses on gaining a deep insight into customer needs and using these to inform every design decision and trade-off. There are different options for the implementation of DFSS. Unlike Six Sigma, which is commonly driven via DMAIC (Define - Measure - Analyze - Improve - Control) projects, DFSS has spawned a number of stepwise processes, all in the style of the DMAIC procedure. DMADV, define ‚Äì measure ‚Äì analyze ‚Äì design ‚Äì verify, is sometimes synonymously referred to as DFSS, although alternatives such as IDOV (Identify, Design, Optimize, Verify) are also used. The traditional DMAIC Six Sigma process, as it is usually practiced, which is focused on evolutionary and continuous improvement manufacturing or service process development, usually occurs after initial system or product design and development have been largely completed. DMAIC Six Sigma as practiced is usually consumed with solving existing manufacturing or service process problems and removal of the defects and variation associated with defects. It is clear that manufacturing variations may impact product reliability. So, a clear link should exist between reliability engineering and Six Sigma (quality). In contrast, DFSS (or DMADV and IDOV) strives to generate a new process where none existed, or where an existing process is deemed to be inadequate and in need of replacement. DFSS aims to create a process with the end in mind of optimally building the efficiencies of Six Sigma methodology into the process before implementation; traditional Six Sigma seeks for continuous improvement after a process already exists. DFSS as an approach to design DFSS seeks to avoid manufacturing/service process problems by using advanced techniques to avoid process problems at the outset (e.g., fire prevention). When combined, these methods obtain the proper needs of the customer, and derive engineering system parameter requirements that increase product and service effectiveness in the eyes of the customer and all other people. This yields products and services that provide great customer satisfaction and increased market share. These techniques also include tools and processes to predict, model and simulate the product delivery system (the processes/tools, personnel and organization, training, facilities, and logistics to produce the product/service). In this way, DFSS is closely related to operations research (solving the knapsack problem), workflow balancing. DFSS is largely a design activity requiring tools including: quality function deployment (QFD), axiomatic design, TRIZ, Design for X, design of experiments (DOE), Taguchi methods, tolerance design, robustification and Response Surface Methodology for a single or multiple response optimization. While these tools are sometimes used in the classic DMAIC Six Sigma process, they are uniquely used by DFSS to analyze new and unprecedented products and processes. It is a concurrent analyzes directed to manufacturing optimization related to the design. Critics Response surface methodology and other DFSS tools uses statistical (often empirical) models, and therefore practitioners need to be aware that even the best statistical model is an approximation to reality. In practice, both the models and the parameter values are unknown, and subject to uncertainty on top of ignorance. Of course, an estimated optimum point need not be optimum in reality, because of the errors of the estimates and of the inadequacies of the model. Nonetheless, response surface methodology has an effective track-record of helping researchers improve products and services: For example, George Box's original response-surface modeling enabled chemical engineers to improve a process that had been stuck at a saddle-point for years. Distinctions from DMAIC Proponents of DMAIC, DDICA (Design Develop Initialize Control and Allocate) and Lean techniques might claim that DFSS falls under the general rubric of Six Sigma or Lean Six Sigma (LSS). Both methodologies focus on meeting customer needs and business priorities as the starting-point for analysis.Bertels, Thomas (2003) Rath & Strong's Six Sigma Leadership Handbook. John Wiley and Sons. pp 57-83 . It is often seen that the tools used for DFSS techniques vary widely from those used for DMAIC Six Sigma. In particular, DMAIC, DDICA practitioners often use new or existing mechanical drawings and manufacturing process instructions as the originating information to perform their analysis, while DFSS practitioners often use simulations and parametric system design/analysis tools to predict both cost and performance of candidate system architectures. While it can be claimed that two processes are similar, in practice the working medium differs enough so that DFSS requires different tool sets in order to perform its design tasks. DMAIC, IDOV and Six Sigma may still be used during depth-first plunges into the system architecture analysis and for \\"back end\\" Six Sigma processes; DFSS provides system design processes used in front-end complex system designs. Back-front systems also are used. This makes 3.4 defects per million design opportunities if done well. Traditional six sigma methodology, DMAIC, has become a standard process optimization tool for the chemical process industries. However, it has become clear that the promise of six sigma, specifically, 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO), is simply unachievable after the fact. Consequently, there has been a growing movement to implement six sigma design usually called design for six sigma DFSS and DDICA tools. This methodology begins with defining customer needs and leads to the development of robust processes to deliver those needs. Design for Six Sigma emerged from the Six Sigma and the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) quality methodologies, which were originally developed by Motorola to systematically improve processes by eliminating defects. Unlike its traditional Six Sigma/DMAIC predecessors, which are usually focused on solving existing manufacturing issues (i.e., \\"fire fighting\\"), DFSS aims at avoiding manufacturing problems by taking a more proactive approach to problem solving and engaging the company efforts at an early stage to reduce problems that could occur (i.e., \\"fire prevention\\"). The primary goal of DFSS is to achieve a significant reduction in the number of nonconforming units and production variation. It starts from an understanding of the customer expectations, needs and Critical to Quality issues (CTQs) before a design can be completed. Typically in a DFSS program, only a small portion of the CTQs are reliability-related (CTR), and therefore, reliability does not get center stage attention in DFSS. DFSS rarely looks at the long-term (after manufacturing) issues that might arise in the product (e.g. complex fatigue issues or electrical wear-out, chemical issues, cascade effects of failures, system level interactions). Similarities with other methods Arguments about what makes DFSS different from Six Sigma demonstrate the similarities between DFSS and other established engineering practices such as probabilistic design and design for quality. In general Six Sigma with its DMAIC roadmap focuses on improvement of an existing process or processes. DFSS focuses on the creation of new value with inputs from customers, suppliers and business needs. While traditional Six Sigma may also use those inputs, the focus is again on improvement and not design of some new product or system. It also shows the engineering background of DFSS. However, like other methods developed in engineering, there is no theoretical reason why DFSS cannot be used in areas outside of engineering. Software engineering applications Historically, although the first successful Design for Six Sigma projects in 1989 and 1991 predate establishment of the DMAIC process improvement process, Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is accepted in part because Six Sigma organisations found that they could not optimise products past three or four Sigma without fundamentally redesigning the product, and because improving a process or product after launch is considered less efficient and effective than designing in quality. ‚ÄòSix Sigma‚Äô levels of performance have to be ‚Äòbuilt-in‚Äô. DFSS for software is essentially a non superficial modification of \\"classical DFSS\\" since the character and nature of software is different from other fields of engineering. The methodology describes the detailed process for successfully applying DFSS methods and tools throughout the software product design, covering the overall Software Development life cycle: requirements, architecture, design, implementation, integration, optimization, verification and validation (RADIOV). The methodology explains how to build predictive statistical models for software reliability and robustness and shows how simulation and analysis techniques can be combined with structural design and architecture methods to effectively produce software and information systems at Six Sigma levels. DFSS in software acts as a glue to blend the classical modelling techniques of software engineering such as object-oriented design or Evolutionary Rapid Development with statistical, predictive models and simulation techniques. The methodology provides Software Engineers with practical tools for measuring and predicting the quality attributes of the software product and also enables them to include software in system reliability models. Data mining and predictive analytics application Although many tools used in DFSS consulting such as response surface methodology, transfer function via linear and non linear modeling, axiomatic design, simulation have their origin in inferential statistics, statistical modeling may overlap with data analytics and mining, However, despite that DFSS as a methodology has been successfully used as an end-to-end [technical project frameworks ] for analytic and mining projects, this has been observed by domain experts to be somewhat similar to the lines of CRISP- DM DFSS is claimed to be better suited for encapsulating and effectively handling higher number of uncertainties including missing and uncertain data, both in terms of acuteness of definition and their absolute total numbers with respect to analytic s and data-mining tasks, six sigma approaches to data- mining are popularly known as DFSS over CRISP [ CRISP- DM referring to data- mining application framework methodology of SPSS ] With DFSS data mining projects have been observed to have considerably shortened development life cycle . This is typically achieved by conducting data analysis to pre-designed template match tests via a techno-functional approach using multilevel quality function deployment on the data-set. Practitioners claim that progressively complex KDD templates are created by multiple DOE runs on simulated complex multivariate data, then the templates along with logs are extensively documented via a decision tree based algorithm DFSS uses Quality Function Deployment and SIPOC for feature engineering of known independent variables, thereby aiding in techno-functional computation of derived attributes Once the predictive model has been computed, DFSS studies can also be used to provide stronger probabilistic estimations of predictive model rank in a real world scenario DFSS framework has been successfully applied for predictive analytics pertaining to the HR analytics field, This application field has been considered to be traditionally very challenging due to the peculiar complexities of predicting human behavior.

It is sponsored by SUNY and Suffolk County, New York. Suffolk County Community College was founded in 1959 and has three campuses: Selden, Brentwood and Riverhead. It also has two satellite centers in Sayville and downtown Riverhead. The school was founded largely through the efforts of Albert Ammerman (1914-November 26, 2008) who was the College's President from its founding in December 1959 until 1983. In its first year it had 13 faculty with 171 full-time students at the Sachem High School in Ronkonkoma and 335 part-time students at Riverhead High School until what is now called the Ammerman campus opened in 1962 in the former Suffolk County Tuberculosis Sanatorium (originally built in 1912). By 1977 it had opened a campus in Riverhead and one on the edge of the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center in Brentwood.'Heart, spirit, soul' of SCCC dies at 94 - Newsday - November 27, 2008 Academics The college offers the Associate in Arts (A.A.), Associate in Science (A.S.), and Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree, as well as a variety of certificate programs. Many students transfer to four-year colleges and universities to complete their baccalaureate degree after attending SCCC. Suffolk is now also partnered with Cornell University through the Pathways to Success Program which allows transfers directly into Cornell degree programs. Suffolk is also partnered with Stony Brook University and typically allows students with a 3.0 GPA and 24 credit hours to transfer. Campuses Ammerman Campus The Ammerman campus at Selden opened in 1961. It is the largest, first, and main campus of Suffolk County Community College. Located off of Nicolls Road, it has become a landmark of Suffolk County. The main campus is the home to the majority of the sports teams as well. The site was previously a tuberculosis sanitarium. Only two of the sanitorium's buildings remain (both of which were built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s) ‚Äî Ammerman Building (the former William Hugh Ross Building for male patients) and Kreiling Hall (the former J.H. Marshall Building for children). School officials deny a persistent rumor that the basement of the Kreiling Hall was used as a morgue noting that the walk-in refrigerators there were used for a cafeteria. As of 2008 only three of the 10,000 Norway spruce and Scotch pine trees that landscaped the sanitarium's grounds remain. Eastern Campus The Eastern campus at Riverhead (actually in the hamlet of Northampton in the Town of Southampton with a Riverhead postal address) opened in 1977 on Speonk-Riverhead Road (CR 88), next to Riverhead-Moriches Road (CR 51). The Eastern campus is the college's smallest. The Eastern campus has really nice hiking trails that are utilized by some athletic courses. Michael J. Grant Campus The Michael J. Grant campus at Brentwood opened in 1974 and is the college's fastest growing. Bordered by Wicks Road, Community College Drive, and Crooked Hill Road (CR 13), the Grant campus is the sole home of the lacrosse, men's & women's track & field, men's & women's bowling, and men's & women's indoor track teams. Downtown Sayville The Sayville Downtown Center opened in 2006. Downtown Riverhead This satellite center is home to The Culinary Arts and Hospitality Center. It opened in 2008. The campus features a cafe that serves breakfast and lunch. Athletics Brookhaven Gymnasium -- home of three national championship teams since 2003 2003 men and women national championship trophy The college's athletics program is a component of the college's co-curricular offerings. SCCC is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association. Athletics are taken place on both the Ammerman and Grant campuses. Men's Intercollegiate sports teams include baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, soccer, swimming, and tennis. Women's teams include soccer, basketball, cheerleading (co-ed), dance (co-ed), cross- country, swimming, softball, tennis, and volleyball. In addition, the office coordinates an intramural program for men and women. In the 2003 the men's basketball team won the NJCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship and the women's basketball team won the NJCAA Women's Basketball Division III Championship. The men repeated as champs in 2004. In 2005 the women's soccer team was formed, where they placed first during the regular season in division III, region 15. Five members of the team made all region first team players- Angela F. Merante, DiAnna G. Dezego, Jaclyn A. Ciamillo, Jacqueline Papile, and Vanessa Thompson. Komi Afeto, their coach, was named coach of the year. http://www.njcaaregion15.org/sport.cfm?sport_ID=5√∑=3&gender;=Female Art galleries Suffolk County Community College has student exhibition galleries on each of its three main campuses.

With the rise in cassette recorder popularity, the BPI feared that the ability of private citizens to record music from the radio onto cassettes would cause a decline in record sales. The logo, consisting of a Jolly Roger formed from the silhouette of a Compact Cassette, also included the words \\"And It's Illegal\\". In the 2000s, the campaign experienced a revival, as the Norwegian branch of IFPI (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry) launched a new campaign named Piracy Kills Music. The campaign has exactly the same message, same name and similar logos. The campaign won the Norwegian 2008 Gulltaggen award for \\"Best Internet Strategy\\" with much controversy. An early proponent of home taping was Malcolm McLaren, who was at the time managing the British new wave band Bow Wow Wow. In 1980, the band released their cassette single \\"C¬∑30 C¬∑60 C¬∑90 Go\\" on cassette that featured a blank B-side on which the buyer could record their own music. The band's record label, EMI, dropped the group shortly afterwards because the single allegedly promoted home taping.  Parodies  Example of a parody of the original logo The slogan was often parodied, one example being the addendum and it's about time too!, used by Dutch anarcho-punk band The Ex. Some fanzines changed the words to Home taping is killing the music industry and added the words ...so be sure to do your part! below the logo. Another example was the early 1980s counter-slogan Home Taping is Skill in Music, referring to early mixtapes, a precursor to sampling and remixes. The cassette & crossbones image was displayed briefly as a backdrop in the \\"Time Out For Fun\\" video by the band Devo from their 1982 album, Oh, No! It's Devo. Venom's 1982 album Black Metal used the logo with the words Home Taping Is Killing Music; So Are Venom. The phrase Home-Taping Is Making Music appears on the back cover of Peter Principle's self-produced 1988 album Tone Poems. The American punk band Rocket from the Crypt sold T-shirts with the tape and bones and the words \\"Home Taping Is Killing the Music Industry: Killing Ain't Wrong.\\" Sonic Youth has T-shirts with the cassette and \\"Sonic Youth\\" written under it. The cover of Billy Bragg's album Workers Playtime featured a notice reading \\"Capitalism is killing music ‚Äì pay no more than ¬£4.99 for this record\\". Mitch Benn also comments \\"Home taping isn't killing music, music's dying of natural causes\\" in the song \\"Steal This Song\\" on the album Radioface. In Poland during the mid-1980s, some (PRONIT label) vinyl pressings of certain albums contained a parody stamp labeled \\"Home taping... is much fun\\". One cassette version of the Dead Kennedys e.p. In God We Trust Inc. had a blank side, printed with the message \\"Home taping is killing record industry profits! We left this side blank so you can help.\\" During the 1980s, rock group The Beat sold blank cassette tapes as merchandise at their live shows. The band frequently encouraged fans and concert patrons to record their live performances instead of illegally copying their studio albums. The group's leader Paul Collins, believed this practice would satisfy a need for instant gratification while preventing the sales of their albums from diminishing. La Route du Rock biannual music festival in France uses the tape image as part of the event's logo. The Pirate Bay logo with cassette and crossbones. More recently, the pro-p2p file sharing group Downhill Battle has used the slogan \\"Home Taping Is Killing the Music Industry, and It's Fun\\" on T-shirts, and the BitTorrent website The Pirate Bay uses the logo of a pirate ship whose sails bear the \\"tape and bones.\\" Additionally the Pirate Party UK has a version of the tape and bones with the logo \\"copyright is killing music ‚Äì and it's legal\\" and the Swedish Piratbyr√•n is using the same tape and bones as their logo. Similar rhetoric has continued; in 1982 Jack Valenti famously compared the VCR and its anticipated effect on the movie industry to the Boston Strangler, and in 2005 Mitch Bainwol of the RIAA claimed that CD burning is hurting music sales. In March 2010, TalkTalk, as part of its campaign against the UK Government's filesharing proposals, created a spoof video entitled \\"Home Taping is Killing Music\\". The song was written and performed by singer/songwriter Dan Bull and featured lookalikes of Madonna, George Michael and Adam Ant lip-synching to the song.

Life  Born in Vienna, Nitsch received training in painting when studied at the Wiener Graphische Lehr-und Versuchanstalt, during which time he was drawn to religious art.Hermann Nitsch, Discogs.Hermann Nitsch, Art Directory. He is associated with the Vienna Actionists‚Äîa loosely affiliated group of off-kilter and confrontational Austrian artists that also includes G√ºnter Brus, Otto Muehl, and Rudolf Schwarzkogler.HERMANN NITSCH, By Jonas Vogt, Alexander Nussbaumer. Nitsch's abstract 'splatter' paintings, like his performance pieces, are inspired by his neutral perspective on humanity and being human. In the 1950s, Nitsch conceived of the Orgien Mysterien Theater (which roughly translates as Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries or The Orgiastic Mystery Theater), staging nearly 100 performances between 1962 and 1998. In 1966 he was with Yoko Ono, Gustav Metzger, Otto Muehl, Wolf Vostell, Juan Hidalgo and others a participant of the Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS) in London.Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS), London, 1966.  Orgien Mysterien Theater  Nitsch's Orgien Mysterien Theater performances (or Aktionen, as he calls them) can be considered both ritualistic and existential. The scene is often involved with slaughters, religious sacrifices, crucifixion, as well as blood and flesh. The performances are also accompanied with music, dancing, and active participants. In his first Orgie Mysterien Theater performance, Nitsch and his friends used animal carcasses, entrails, and blood similarly to a ritual. The cloths, bandages and other fabrics used in these performances introduced Nitsch to the idea of making paintings. Most recently, he has exhibited his works during the Venice Biennale 2017 at the European Cultural Centre.  Controversial aspects  Having grown up during World War II, Nitsch reveals his fascination with the intensity of religious feelings for life in his art work with excessive means such as taboo images, nudity, bloody scenes and more. For this, he received several court trials, being charged with gross public indecency and sentenced to three prison terms. It is often suggested that his work may exemplify certain peoples' fascination with violence.Article in Italian newspaper La RepubblicaSabbath, Bloody Sabbath: The Sacrificial Rites of Hermann Nitsch.

It first aired on 13 December 1972 on Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola. The film won the 1973 International Emmy Award for Fiction, the only Spanish programme to have won it. In the 35-minute film, a man becomes trapped in a telephone booth, while passersby seem unable to help him. It was uploaded on YouTube in August 2019 by RTVE Archivo. Plot The film opens with an unnamed company installing a phone booth in the middle of a square. Later, a man takes his son to the school bus. He enters the phone booth to make a call and the door slowly closes behind him. The man realizes that the phone doesn't work, so he tries to leave only to discover that the door is stuck. He tries desperately to get it open, but nothing works. Eventually two business men come by and try to help him out, but to no avail. This gathers the attention of many passers- by who begin to congregate and watch the action. Several people (including a strong man, a repair man and a police officer) try to open the door but it remains stuck. Eventually a firefighter is just about to try to break open the glass roof of the phone booth when the phone booth company appears. They unbolt the booth and take the booth (with the man inside it) away on their truck. The crowd cheers and gladly waves the man away. The man watches frantically as he is carted across town. He tries to scream for help from people, but everyone just smiles and waves. Eventually the truck stops next to another truck also carrying a man stuck in a phone booth. The two men try to communicate but cannot. After many hours the truck arrives at a massive underground warehouse. The phone booth is lifted up in the air by a giant magnet and the truck drives away. The phone booth is carried by a forklift through the warehouse, which is full of phone booths containing decaying remains of other trapped citizens. The man struggles in fear but cannot escape. The forklift drops him and leaves. The man looks to his right and sees the trapped man he saw on his way to the warehouse who has strangled himself with the telephone cord. The man collapses out of frame in despair. The film ends with the phone booth company setting up a similar booth in the same park.

The script was written by Richard Recco and Damien Lichtenstein. It stars Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner with supporting roles Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Bokeem Woodbine, Christian Slater, and Kevin Pollak. It is a story of theft and betrayal, revolving around a plot to rob the Riviera Casino during a convention of Elvis impersonators. Before the film's opening, Warner Bros. released a series of animated prequels, \\"The Road to Graceland\\", voiced by stars Costner, Slater, Long, and Woodbine. The film was panned by the critics and was a box office bomb making only $18.7 million against its $62 million budget. It received five nominations at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Costner), Worst Supporting Actress (Cox), Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Couple (Russell and either Costner or Cox). Plot Recent parolee Michael Zane stops at a run-down desert motel outside Las Vegas, Nevada. He catches a boy, Jesse, stealing from his car, and chases him back to his mother, Cybil Waingrow, who he seduces. The following morning, four men arrive to pick him up: Murphy, Hanson, Gus, and Franklin. Dressed in Elvis costumes, the group goes to Las Vegas and robs a casino holding an Elvis convention. A firefight breaks out and Franklin is killed during their escape. Back at the motel, Hanson and Murphy argue about Franklin's share until Murphy shoots Hanson. Michael hides the money in the crawl space, unaware that Jesse is watching him. The three remaining thieves drive into the desert to bury Hanson. Murphy returns alone after shooting Gus and Michael, but crashes his car and is knocked unconscious before reaching the motel. Michael was wearing a bulletproof vest and survived the shooting by playing dead. He makes his way back to the motel and discovers that the money is missing. Guessing that Jesse was responsible, he storms into Cybil's place and finds the money. He tries to bribe Cybil to forget the situation, but eventually agrees to take Cybil and Jesse with him. Michael explains that the money is marked, but says Murphy knows a money launderer in Idaho who can help. Murphy, realizing that Michael has taken the money, drives to Idaho to intercept him. At a restaurant, Cybil steals Michael's wallet and sneaks away from Michael and Jesse. She takes Michael's car and calls the money launderer, Peterson, using a password she found in Michael's wallet. Murphy appears at the money launderer's premises using the same password. Peterson explains that Cybil called first, so they wait for her. Cybil arrives and finds Murphy, who she assumes is Peterson. Michael and Jesse arrive later in a stolen car and find the premises empty except for the bodies of Peterson and his secretary. Michael guesses that Murphy has his car and reports it stolen, causing Murphy to be arrested. The police discover that Michael is also driving a stolen car and arrest him as well. The men are put in adjoining cells and have a confrontation. Jesse helps Michael make bail after Michael agrees to make him his partner. Murphy calls a man named Jack who helps him make bail. Michael retrieves his car and finds Cybil tied up and gagged in the trunk. Murphy is picked up while hitchhiking, then kills the driver and steals his clothes and vehicle. Cybil and Jesse drive by. Murphy runs them off the road, and takes Jesse hostage, telling Cybil to find Michael and the money. Cybil begs Michael for help. After some persuasion, Michael decides to help and reports Murphy to the authorities. Michael meets Murphy at a warehouse with the money and convinces him to release Jesse. As Murphy realizes that the bag is full of cut-up newspaper instead of money, he is stung by a scorpion that Michael hid inside. A SWAT team surrounds the warehouse. Murphy pretends to surrender but grabs a gun and shoots Michael. A gunfight ensues. Murphy refuses to surrender and is killed by police. An ambulance takes Michael for medical care, but is stolen by Cybil and Jesse. Once again, Michael wore a bulletproof vest, and is only slightly injured. The three escape together and are seen on Michael's boat, the \\"Graceland\\". Cast Production Title The film's title is a reference to Elvis Presley's residence, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee. While attempting to capture Thomas J. Murphy, the U.S. Marshals (correctly) believe he is attempting to cross the border into Canada somewhere through Washington/Idaho/Montana, a distance which (as stated by U.S. Marshal Quigley) is \\"3000 miles to Graceland.\\" Michael also seeks to escape by crossing the border into Canada through Washington. Release Box office The film was a box office bomb. It opened at #3 at the North American box office, earning US$7,160,521 in its opening weekend behind Down to Earth and Hannibal. Critical response 3000 Miles to Graceland received mostly negative reviews by critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 14% of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 96 reviews, with an average score of 3.49/10, with the consensus; \\"While the premise sounds promising, the movie turns out to be a tedious and unnecessarily violent heist movie that's low on laughs and leaves no cliche unturned.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 from reviews by mainstream critics, gave the film rating of 21 based on 30 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Accolades The film was nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Costner), Worst Supporting Actress (Cox), Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Couple (Russell and either Costner or Cox) but failed to win any of those categories. The film was also nominated for five Stinkers Bad Movie Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Costner), Worst Supporting Actress, Most Annoying Fake Accent ‚Äì Female (Cox), and Most Annoying On-Screen Group (The Elvis Impersonators) but failed to win any of those categories.

The scientific name of the species honours the botanist Frederick Manson Bailey. It is indigenous to a very small area in southern inland New South Wales, comprising Temora, Cootamundra, Stockinbingal and Bethungra districts. However, it has been widely planted in other Australian states and territories. In many areas of Victoria, it has become naturalised and is regarded as a weed, outcompeting indigenous Victorian species. Almost all wattles have cream to golden flowers. The small flowers are arranged in spherical to cylindrical inflorescences, with only the stamens prominent. Wattles have been extensively introduced into New Zealand.  Uses  Profile of a Cootamundra wattle in Canberra, ACT A. baileyana is used in Europe in the cut flower industry. It is also used as food for bees in the production of honey. American urban landscape designer Ren√©e Gunter uses this plant in her South Los Angeles lawn as a drought-resistant alternative to thirstier plants.Lodi News-Sentinel, Oct 12, 2007, Bettijane Levine, Los Angeles Times, Drought resistant plants, Retrieved Aug. 18,2007 Less than 0.02% alkaloids were found in a chemical analysis of Acacia baileyana. Cultivation This plant is adaptable and easy to grow. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Unfortunately, it has an ability to naturalise (i.e. escape) into surrounding bushland. Also, it hybridises with some other wattles, notably the rare and endangered Sydney Basin species Acacia pubescens. A prostrate weeping form is in cultivation. Its origin is unknown, but it is a popular garden plant, with its cascading horizontal branches good for rockeries. The fine foliage of the original Cootamundra wattle is grey-green, but a blue-purple foliaged form, known as 'Purpurea' is very popular. Use of colour The colour Cootamundra wattle is used currently by the Australian Capital Territory Fire Brigade as their colour scheme for firefighting appliances.

A follower of Giotto, Altichiero is credited with founding the Veronese school. He worked in Verona and Padua‚Äîworks by him survive in the church of Sant'Anastasia in Verona and in the basilica of Sant'Antonio and the Oratorio di San Giorgio in Padua (where the credit for the work has been generally shared with Jacopo d'Avanzi, about whom little is known). Altichiero was probably born somewhere near Zevio. He became an important member of the della Scala's household, and around 1364 painted a series of frescoes based upon Flavius Josephus's The Wars of the Jews at the della Scala palace of Sala del Podest√†. There are frescoes by him in the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua. In conjunction with D'Avanzo Veronese, he frescoed the chapel of St. James for which he was paid 792 ducats. The first seven frescoes on the life of St. James the Elder were by Altichiero. The last record of Altichiero is a Paduan archival document of September 1384.

This might include an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis or treatment of a disease, injury, syndrome, behavior, infection, or other ailment. Globally, it is estimated that 142,000 people died in 2013 from adverse effects of medical treatment; this is an increase from 94,000 in 1990. However, a 2016 study of the number of deaths that were a result of medical error in the U.S. placed the yearly death rate in the U.S. alone at 251,454 deaths, which suggests that the 2013 global estimation may not be accurate.  Definitions  The word error in medicine is used as a label for nearly all of the clinical incidents that harm patients. Medical errors are often described as human errors in healthcare. Whether the label is a medical error or human error, one definition used in medicine says that it occurs when a healthcare provider chooses an inappropriate method of care, improperly executes an appropriate method of care, or reads the wrong CT scan. It has been said that the definition should be the subject of more debate. For instance, studies of hand hygiene compliance of physicians in an ICU show that compliance varied from 19% to 85%. The deaths that result from infections caught as a result of treatment providers improperly executing an appropriate method of care by not complying with known safety standards for hand hygiene are difficult to regard as innocent accidents or mistakes. There are many types of medical error, from minor to major, and causality is often poorly determined. There are many taxonomies for classifying medical errors.  Impact  Globally, it is estimated that 142,000 people died in 2013 from adverse effects of medical treatment; in 1990, the number was 94,000. According to recent medical malpractice statistics, in the United States, at least 250,000 people have died annually of medical errors and negligence. A 2000 Institute of Medicine report estimated that medical errors result in between 44,000 and 98,000 preventable deaths and 1,000,000 excess injuries each year in U.S. hospitals. In the UK, a 2000 study found that an estimated 850,000 medical errors occur each year, costing over ¬£2 billion. Some researchers questioned the accuracy of the IOM study, criticizing the statistical handling of measurement errors in the report, significant subjectivity in determining which deaths were \\"avoidable\\" or due to medical error, and an erroneous assumption that 100% of patients would have survived if optimal care had been provided. A 2001 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association of seven Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers estimated that for roughly every 10,000 patients admitted to the select hospitals, one patient died who would have lived for three months or more in good cognitive health had \\"optimal\\" care been provided. A 2006 follow-up to the IOM study found that medication errors are among the most common medical mistakes, harming at least 1.5 million people every year. According to the study, 400,000 preventable drug-related injuries occur each year in hospitals, 800,000 in long-term care settings, and roughly 530,000 among Medicare recipients in outpatient clinics. The report stated that these are likely to be conservative estimates. In 2000 alone, the extra medical costs incurred by preventable drug-related injuries approximated $887 millionand the study looked only at injuries sustained by Medicare recipients, a subset of clinic visitors. None of these figures take into account lost wages and productivity or other costs. According to a 2002 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report, about 7,000 people were estimated to die each year from medication errors ‚Äì about 16 percent more deaths than the number attributable to work-related injuries (6,000 deaths). Medical errors affect one in 10 patients worldwide. One extrapolation suggests that 180,000 people die each year partly as a result of iatrogenic injury. One in five Americans (22%) report that they or a family member have experienced a medical error of some kind.2002 Annual Report , The Commonwealth Fund The World Health Organization registered 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths in 2012. It estimated that the number of cases could increase by 70% through 2032. As the number of cancer patients receiving treatment increases, hospitals around the world are seeking ways to improve patient safety, to emphasize traceability and raise efficiency in their cancer treatment processes. A study released in 2016 found medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease and cancer. Researchers looked at studies that analyzed the medical death rate data from 2000 to 2008 and extrapolated that over 250,000 deaths per year had stemmed from a medical error, which translates to 9.5% of all deaths annually in the US.  Difficulties in measuring frequency of errors  About 1% of hospital admissions result in an adverse event due to negligence. However, mistakes are likely much more common, as these studies identify only mistakes that led to measurable adverse events occurring soon after the errors. Independent review of doctors' treatment plans suggests that decision-making could be improved in 14% of admissions; many of the benefits would have delayed manifestations. Even this number may be an underestimate. One study suggests that adults in the United States receive only 55% of recommended care. At the same time, a second study found that 30% of care in the United States may be unnecessary. For example, if a doctor fails to order a mammogram that is past due, this mistake will not show up in the first type of study. In addition, because no adverse event occurred during the short follow-up of the study, the mistake also would not show up in the second type of study because only the principal treatment plans were critiqued. However, the mistake would be recorded in the third type of study. If a doctor recommends an unnecessary treatment or test, it may not show in any of these types of studies. Cause of death on United States death certificates, statistically compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are coded in the International Classification of Disease (ICD), which does not include codes for human and system factors.  Causes  Medical errors are associated with inexperienced physicians and nurses, new procedures, extremes of age, and complex or urgent care. Poor communication (whether in one's own language or, as may be the case for medical tourists, another language), improper documentation, illegible handwriting, spelling errors, inadequate nurse-to-patient ratios, and similarly named medications are also known to contribute to the problem. Patient actions may also contribute significantly to medical errors. Falls, for example, may result from patients' own misjudgements. Human error has been implicated in nearly 80 percent of adverse events that occur in complex healthcare systems. The vast majority of medical errors result from faulty systems and poorly designed processes versus poor practices or incompetent practitioners.  Healthcare complexity  Complicated technologies, powerful drugs, intensive care, rare and multiple diseases, and prolonged hospital stay can contribute to medical errors.  System and process design  In 2000, The Institute of Medicine released \\"To Err is Human,\\" which asserted that the problem in medical errors is not bad people in health care‚Äîit is that good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer. Poor communication and unclear lines of authority of physicians, nurses, and other care providers are also contributing factors. Disconnected reporting systems within a hospital can result in fragmented systems in which numerous hand-offs of patients results in lack of coordination and errors. Other factors include the impression that action is being taken by other groups within the institution, reliance on automated systems to prevent error., and inadequate systems to share information about errors, which hampers analysis of contributory causes and improvement strategies. Cost- cutting measures by hospitals in response to reimbursement cutbacks can compromise patient safety. In emergencies, patient care may be rendered in areas poorly suited for safe monitoring. The American Institute of Architects has identified concerns for the safe design and construction of health care facilities. Infrastructure failure is also a concern. According to the WHO, 50% of medical equipment in developing countries is only partly usable due to lack of skilled operators or parts. As a result, diagnostic procedures or treatments cannot be performed, leading to substandard treatment. The Joint Commission's Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007 found that inadequate communication between healthcare providers, or between providers and the patient and family members, was the root cause of over half the serious adverse events in accredited hospitals.The Joint Commission‚Äôs Annual Report on Quality and Safety 2007: Improving America‚Äôs Hospitals (Accessed 2008-04-09) Other leading causes included inadequate assessment of the patient's condition, and poor leadership or training.  Competency, education, and training  Variations in healthcare provider training & experience and failure to acknowledge the prevalence and seriousness of medical errors also increase the risk. The so-called July effect occurs when new residents arrive at teaching hospitals, causing an increase in medication errors according to a study of data from 1979‚Äì2006.  Human factors and ergonomics  Cognitive errors commonly encountered in medicine were initially identified by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in the early 1970s. Jerome Groopman, author of How Doctors Think, says these are \\"cognitive pitfalls\\", biases which cloud our logic. For example, a practitioner may overvalue the first data encountered, skewing his thinking. Another example may be where the practitioner recalls a recent or dramatic case that quickly comes to mind, coloring the practitioner's judgement. Another pitfall is where stereotypes may prejudice thinking. Pat Croskerry describes clinical reasoning as an interplay between intuitive, subconscious thought (System 1) and deliberate, conscious rational consideration (System 2). In this framework, many cognitive errors reflect over-reliance on System 1 processing, although cognitive errors may also sometimes involve System 2. Sleep deprivation has also been cited as a contributing factor in medical errors. One study found that being awake for over 24 hours caused medical interns to double or triple the number of preventable medical errors, including those that resulted in injury or death. The risk of car crash after these shifts increased by 168%, and the risk of near miss by 460%.When Doctors Don't Sleep, Talk of the Nation, National Public Radio, 13 December 2006. Interns admitted falling asleep during lectures, during rounds, and even during surgeries. Night shifts are associated with worse surgeon performance during laparoscopic surgeries. Practitioner risk factors include fatigue, depression, and burnout. Factors related to the clinical setting include diverse patients, unfamiliar settings, time pressures, and increased patient-to-nurse staffing ratio increases. Drug names that look alike or sound alike are also a problem. Errors in interpreting medical images are often perceptual instead of \\"fact-based\\"; these errors are often caused by failures of attention or vision.  Examples  Errors can include misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, administration of the wrong drug to the wrong patient or in the wrong way, giving multiple drugs that interact negatively, surgery on an incorrect site, failure to remove all surgical instruments, failure to take the correct blood type into account, or incorrect record-keeping. A 10th type of error is ones which are not watched for by researchers, such as RNs failing to program an IV pump to give a full dose of IV antibiotics or other medication.  Errors in diagnosis  According to a 2016 study from Johns Hopkins Medicine, medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in the United States. The projected cost of these errors to the U.S. economy is approximately $20 billion, 87% of which are direct increases in medical costs of providing services to patient affected by medical errors. Medical errors can increase average hospital costs by as much as $4,769 per patient. One common type of medical error stems from x-rays and medical imaging: failing to see or notice signs of disease on an image. The retrospective \\"miss\\" rate among abnormal imaging studies is reported to be as high as 30% (the real-life error rate is much lower, around 4-5%, because not all images are abnormal), and up to 20% of missed findings result in long-term adverse effects. A large study reported several cases where patients were wrongly told that they were HIV-negative when the physicians erroneously ordered and interpreted HTLV (a closely related virus) testing rather than HIV testing. In the same study, >90% of HTLV tests were ordered erroneously. It is estimated that between 10-15% of physician diagnoses are erroneous. Misdiagnosis of lower extremity cellulitis is estimated to occur in 30% of patients, leading to unnecessary hospitalizations in 85% and unnecessary antibiotic use in 92%. Collectively, these errors lead to between 50,000 and 130,000 unnecessary hospitalizations and between $195 and $515 million in avoidable health care spending annually in the United States.  Misdiagnosis of psychological disorders  Female sexual desire sometimes used to be diagnosed as female hysteria. Sensitivities to foods and food allergies risk being misdiagnosed as the anxiety disorder Orthorexia. Studies have found that bipolar disorder has often been misdiagnosed as major depression. Its early diagnosis necessitates that clinicians pay attention to the features of the patient's depression and also look for present or prior hypomanic or manic symptomatology. The misdiagnosis of schizophrenia is also a common problem. There may be long delays of patients getting a correct diagnosis of this disorder. Delayed sleep phase disorder is often confused with: psychophysiological insomnia; depression; psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, ADHD or ADD; other sleep disorders; or school refusal. Practitioners of sleep medicine point out the dismally low rate of accurate diagnosis of the disorder, and have often asked for better physician education on sleep disorders. Cluster headaches are often misdiagnosed, mismanaged, or undiagnosed for many years; they may be confused with migraine, \\"cluster-like\\" headache (or mimics), CH subtypes, other TACs ( trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias), or other types of primary or secondary headache syndrome. Cluster-like head pain may be diagnosed as secondary headache rather than cluster headache. Under-recognition of CH by health care professionals is reflected in consistent findings in Europe and the United States that the average time to diagnosis is around seven years. Asperger and Autism tend to get undiagnosed or delayed recognition and delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosed. Delayed or mistaken diagnosis can be traumatic for individuals and families; for example, misdiagnosis can lead to medications that worsen behavior. The DSM-5 field trials included \\"test-retest reliability\\" which involved different clinicians doing independent evaluations of the same patient‚Äîa new approach to the study of diagnostic reliability.  Outpatient vs. inpatient  Misdiagnosis is the leading cause of medical error in outpatient facilities. Since the National Institute of Medicine's 1999 report, ‚ÄúTo Err is Human,‚Äù found up to 98,000 hospital patients die from preventable medical errors in the U.S. each year, government and private sector efforts have focused on inpatient safety.  Medical prescriptions  While in 2000 the Committee on Quality of Health Care in America in 2000 affirmed medical are an \\"unavoidable outcome of learning to practice medicine\\", at 2019 the commonly accepted link between prescribing skills and clinical clerkships was not yet demonstrated by the available data and in the U.S. legibility of handwritten prescriptions has been indirectly responsible for at least 7,000 deaths annually. Prescription errors concern ambiguous abbreviations, the right spelling of the full name of drugs: improper use of the nomenclature, of decimal points, unit or rate expressions; legibility and proper instructions; miscalculations of the posology (quantity, route and frequency of administration, duration of the treatment, dosage form and dosage strength); lack of information about patients (e.g. allergy, declining renal function) or reported in the medical document.  After an error has occurred  Mistakes can have a strongly negative emotional impact on the doctors who commit them.  Recognizing that mistakes are not isolated events  Some physicians recognize that adverse outcomes from errors usually do not happen because of an isolated error and actually reflect system problems. This concept is often referred to as the Swiss Cheese Model. This is the concept that there are layers of protection for clinicians and patients to prevent mistakes from occurring. Therefore, even if a doctor or nurse makes a small error (e.g. incorrect dose of drug written on a drug chart by doctor), this is picked up before it actually affects patient care (e.g. pharmacist checks the drug chart and rectifies the error). Such mechanisms include: Practical alterations (e.g.-medications that cannot be given through IV, are fitted with tubing which means they cannot be linked to an IV even if a clinician makes a mistake and tries to), systematic safety processes (e.g. all patients must have a Waterlow score assessment and falls assessment completed on admission), and training programmes/continuing professional development courses are measures that may be put in place. There may be several breakdowns in processes to allow one adverse outcome. In addition, errors are more common when other demands compete for a physician's attention. However, placing too much blame on the system may not be constructive.  Placing the practice of medicine in perspective  Essayists imply that the potential to make mistakes is part of what makes being a physician rewarding and without this potential the rewards of medical practice would be diminished. Laurence states that \\"Everybody dies, you and all of your patients. All relationships end. Would you want it any other way? [...] Don't take it personally\\" Seder states \\"[...] if I left medicine, I would mourn its loss as I've mourned the passage of my poetry. On a daily basis, it is both a privilege and a joy to have the trust of patients and their families and the camaraderie of peers. There is no challenge to make your blood race like that of a difficult case, no mind game as rigorous as the challenging differential diagnosis, and though the stakes are high, so are the rewards.\\"  Disclosing mistakes  Forgiveness, which is part of many cultural traditions, may be important in coping with medical mistakes. = To oneself = Inability to forgive oneself may create a cycle of distress and increased likelihood of a future error. However, Wu et al. suggest \\"...those who coped by accepting responsibility were more likely to make constructive changes in practice, but [also] to experience more emotional distress.\\" It may be helpful to consider the much larger number of patients who are not exposed to mistakes and are helped by medical care. = To patients = Gallagher et al. state that patients want \\"information about what happened, why the error happened, how the error's consequences will be mitigated, and how recurrences will be prevented.\\" Interviews with patients and families reported in a 2003 book by Rosemary Gibson and Janardan Prasad Singh, put forward that those who have been harmed by medical errors face a \\"wall of silence\\" and \\"want an acknowledgement\\" of the harm. With honesty, \\"healing can begin not just for the patients and their families but also the doctors, nurses and others involved.\\" Detailed suggestions on how to disclose are available. A 2005 study by Wendy Levinson of the University of Toronto showed surgeons discussing medical errors used the word \\"error\\" or \\"mistake\\" in only 57 percent of disclosure conversations and offered a verbal apology only 47 percent of the time. Patient disclosure is important in the medical error process. The current standard of practice at many hospitals is to disclose errors to patients when they occur. In the past, it was a common fear that disclosure to the patient would incite a malpractice lawsuit. Many physicians would not explain that an error had taken place, causing a lack of trust toward the healthcare community. In 2007, 34 states passed legislation that precludes any information from a physician's apology for a medical error from being used in malpractice court (even a full admission of fault).Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) http://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer.aspx?primerID=2 This encourages physicians to acknowledge and explain mistakes to patients, keeping an open line of communication. The American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs states in its ethics code: :\\"Situations occasionally occur in which a patient suffers significant medical complications that may have resulted from the physician's mistake or judgment. In these situations, the physician is ethically required to inform the patient of all facts necessary to ensure understanding of what has occurred. Concern regarding legal liability which might result following truthful disclosure should not affect the physician's honesty with a patient.\\" From the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual: :‚ÄúIn addition, physicians should disclose to patients information about procedural or judgment errors made in the course of care if such information is material to the patient's well-being. Errors do not necessarily constitute improper, negligent, or unethical behavior, but failure to disclose them may.‚Äù However, \\"there appears to be a gap between physicians' attitudes and practices regarding error disclosure. Willingness to disclose errors was associated with higher training level and a variety of patient-centered attitudes, and it was not lessened by previous exposure to malpractice litigation\\". Hospital administrators may share these concerns. Consequently, in the United States, many states have enacted laws excluding expressions of sympathy after accidents as proof of liability. However, \\"excluding from admissibility in court proceedings apologetic expressions of sympathy but not fault-admitting apologies after accidents\\" Disclosure may actually reduce malpractice payments. = To non-physicians = In a study of physicians who reported having made a mistake, it was offered that disclosing to non-physician sources of support may reduce stress more than disclosing to physician colleagues. This may be due to the finding that of the physicians in the same study, when presented with a hypothetical scenario of a mistake made by another colleague, only 32% of them would have unconditionally offered support. It is possible that greater benefit occurs when spouses are physicians. = To other physicians = Discussing mistakes with other physicians is beneficial. However, medical providers may be less forgiving of one another. The reason is not clear, but one essayist has admonished, \\"Don't Take Too Much Joy in the Mistakes of Other Doctors.\\" = To the physician's institution = Disclosure of errors, especially 'near misses' may be able to reduce subsequent errors in institutions that are capable of reviewing near misses. However, doctors report that institutions may not be supportive of the doctor. = Use of rationalization to cover up medical errors = Based on anecdotal and survey evidence, Banja states that rationalization (making excuses) is very common among the medical profession to cover up medical errors. = By potential for harm to the patient = In a survey of more than 10,000 physicians in the United States, when asked the question, \\"Are there times when it's acceptable to cover up or avoid revealing a mistake if that mistake would not cause harm to the patient?\\", 19% answered yes, 60% answered no and 21% answered it depends. On the question, \\"Are there times when it is acceptable to cover up or avoid revealing a mistake if that mistake would potentially or likely harm the patient?\\", 2% answered yes, 95% answered no and 3% answered it depends.  Cause-specific preventive measures  Traditionally, errors are attributed to mistakes made by individuals, who then may be penalized. A common approach to respond to and prevent specific errors is requiring additional checks at particular points in the system, whose findings and detail of execution must be recorded. As an example, an error of free flow IV administration of heparin is approached by teaching staff how to use the IV systems and to use special care in setting the IV pump. While overall errors become less likely, the checks add to workload and may in themselves be a cause of additional errors. In some hospitals, a regular morbidity and mortality conference meeting is scheduled to discuss complications or deaths and learn from or improve the overall processes. A newer model for improvement in medical care takes its origin from the work of W. Edwards Deming in a model of Total Quality Management. In this model, there is an attempt to identify the underlying system defect that allowed the error to occur. As an example, in such a system the error of free flow IV administration of heparin is dealt with by not using IV heparin and substituting subcutaneous administration of heparin, obviating the entire problem. However, such an approach presupposes available research showing that subcutaneous heparin is as effective as IV. Thus, most systems use a combination of approaches to the problem.  In specific specialties  The field of medicine that has taken the lead in systems approaches to safety is anaesthesiology. Steps such as standardization of IV medications to 1 ml doses, national and international color-coding standards, and development of improved airway support devices has the field a model of systems improvement in care. Pharmacy professionals have extensively studied the causes of errors in the prescribing, preparation, dispensing and administration of medications. As far back as the 1930s, pharmacists worked with physicians to select, from many options, the safest and most effective drugs available for use in hospitals. The process is known as the Formulary System and the list of drugs is known as the Formulary. In the 1960s, hospitals implemented unit dose packaging and unit dose drug distribution systems to reduce the risk of wrong drug and wrong dose errors in hospitalized patients; centralized sterile admixture services were shown to decrease the risks of contaminated and infected intravenous medications; and pharmacists provided drug information and clinical decision support directly to physicians to improve the safe and effective use of medications. Pharmacists are recognized experts in medication safety and have made many contributions that reduce error and improve patient care over the last 50 years. More recently, governments have attempted to address issues like patient-pharmacist communication and consumer knowledge through measures like the Australian Government's Quality Use of Medicines policy.  Legal procedure  Standards and regulations for medical malpractice vary by country and jurisdiction within countries. Medical professionals may obtain professional liability insurances to offset the risk and costs of lawsuits based on medical malpractice.  Prevention  Medical care is frequently compared adversely to aviation; while many of the factors that lead to errors in both fields are similar, aviation's error management protocols are regarded as much more effective. Safety measures include informed consent, the availability of a second practitioner's opinion, voluntary reporting of errors, root cause analysis, reminders to improve patient medication adherence, hospital accreditation, and systems to ensure review by experienced or specialist practitioners. A template has been developed for the design (both structure and operation) of hospital medication safety programmes, particularly for acute tertiary settings, which emphasizes safety culture, infrastructure, data (error detection and analysis), communication and training. Particularly to prevent the medication errors in the perspective of the intrathecal administration of local anaesthetics, there is a proposal to change the presentation and packaging of the appliances and agents used for this purpose. One spinal needle with a syringe prefilled with the local anaesthetic agents may be marketed in a single blister pack, which will be peeled open and presented before the anaesthesiologist conducting the procedure.  Reporting requirements  In the United States, adverse medical event reporting systems were mandated in just over half (27) of the states as of 2014, a figure unchanged since 2007. In U.S. hospitals error reporting is a condition of payment by Medicare.\\"Report Finds Most Errors at Hospitals Go Unreported\\" article by Robert Pear in The New York Times January 6, 2012 An investigation by the Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services released January 6, 2012 found that most errors are not reported and even in the case of errors that are reported and investigated changes are seldom made which would prevent them in the future. The investigation revealed that there was often lack of knowledge regarding which events were reportable and recommended that lists of reportable events be developed.Summary \\"Hospital Incident Reporting Systems Do Not Capture Most Patient Harm\\" Report (OEI-06-09-00091) Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services, January 6, 2012  Misconceptions  These are the common misconceptions about adverse events, and the arguments and explanations against those misconceptions are noted in parentheses: *\\"Bad apples\\" or incompetent health care providers are a common cause. (Although human error is commonly an initiating event, the faulty care delivery process invariably permits or compounds the harm and so is the focus of improvement.) * High-risk procedures or medical specialties are responsible for most avoidable adverse events. (Although some mistakes, such as in surgery, are harder to conceal, errors occur in all levels of care. Even though complex procedures entail more risk, adverse outcomes are not usually due to error, but to the severity of the condition being treated.) However, United States Pharmacopeia has reported that medication errors during the course of a surgical procedure are three times more likely to cause harm to a patient than those occurring in other types of hospital care. * If a patient experiences an adverse event during the process of care, an error has occurred.

Approximately 2,650 students are enrolled at Skidmore pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in one of more than 60 areas of study. History Skidmore College has undergone many transformations since its founding in the early 20th century as a women's college. The Young Women's Industrial Club was formed in 1903 by Lucy Ann Skidmore (1853‚Äì1931) with inheritance money from her husband who died in 1879, and from her father, Joseph Russell Skidmore (1821‚Äì1882), a former coal merchant. In 1911, the club was chartered under the name \\"Skidmore School of Arts\\" as a college to vocationally and professionally train young women.\\"Skidmore School of Arts\\". Skidmore College. Retrieved June 10, 2014. Charles Henry Keyes became the first president of the school in 1912, and in 1919 Skidmore conferred its first baccalaureate degrees under the authority of the University of the State of New York. By 1922 the school had been chartered independently as a four- year, degree-granting college. Skidmore College was in downtown Saratoga Springs at first, but on October 28, 1961, the college acquired the Jonsson Campus, of land on the outer edges of Saratoga Springs. The Jonsson Campus was named for the Skidmore trustee Erik Jonsson, the founder and president of Texas Instruments and a former mayor of Dallas, Texas (1964‚Äì71). The new Jonsson Tower bears his name. The first new buildings on the campus opened in 1966, and by 1973 the move was mostly complete. The old campus was sold to Verrazzano College, a new institution that did not prove successful, and its buildings have since been put to other uses. In 1971, the college began admitting men to its regular undergraduate program (a few dozen male World War II veterans had been admitted in 1946-49). Skidmore also launched the \\"University Without Walls\\" (UWW) program, which allows nonresident students over age 25 to earn bachelor's degrees. The program ended in May 2011. Also in 1971, Skidmore established a Phi Beta Kappa chapter. In 1988, Skidmore faculty formed the Collaborative Research Program, which provides students with opportunities to co-author papers and studies with professors. Skidmore began granting master's degrees in 1991 through its Master of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) program. The Skidmore Honors Forum was founded in 1998. In 2003, Philip A. Glotzbach became the College's seventh president. After his presidency was announced, to welcome him to Skidmore, students rallied and drummed up support for his presidency by writing slogans in chalk on sidewalks around the campus. In February 2019, Glotzbach announced that he would retire at the end of the 2019-2020 school year. 2006 marked the start of the largest campaign in Skidmore's history, Creative Thought. Bold Promise. The goal was to raise $200 million, which was reached and surpassed in 2010 and celebrated at Celebration Weekend. Presidents # Charles Henry Keyes, 1912‚Äì1925 # Henry T.

There are 43 majors, an average class size of 16, and more than 1000 courses offered. The most popular majors pursued by Skidmore students include English, business, psychology, political science, economics, studio art, theater, biology and environmental studies. The World Language department is especially diverse, and enables students to take classes in over six different languages. Students are also encouraged to take their education outside of the classroom with internships. These can be taken for credit and can be completed throughout the academic year; nearly 85% of students participate in an internship during their Skidmore career. Opportunities for these internships are highly publicized both by the departments themselves and by the career center. Due to the definition of degrees by New York State, Skidmore cannot accredit all departments with a Bachelors of Science. A B.S. is given to those students majoring in Art (Studio), Dance, Dance-Theater, Education, Exercise Science, Business, Social Work, and Theater. The distinction rests in the number of hours of \\"non-liberal arts\\" courses allowed toward the 120 credit hours needed for graduation, 60 for a B.S. and 30 for a B.A. These \\"non- liberal arts\\"-designated courses are considered by the college to be of a professional nature.\\"Catalog 2014 ‚Äì2015\\".

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 7th edition Paper marbling is a method of aqueous surface design, which can produce patterns similar to smooth marble or other kinds of stone. The patterns are the result of color floated on either plain water or a viscous solution known as size, and then carefully transferred to an absorbent surface, such as paper or fabric. Through several centuries, people have applied marbled materials to a variety of surfaces. It is often employed as a writing surface for calligraphy, and especially book covers and endpapers in bookbinding and stationery. Part of its appeal is that each print is a unique monotype.  Procedure  Oil-based inks in a tank of water being prepared for marbling. There are several methods for making marbled papers. A shallow tray is filled with water, and various kinds of ink or paint colors are carefully applied to the surface with an ink brush. Various additives or surfactant chemicals are used to help float the colors. A drop of \\"negative\\" color made of plain water with the addition of surfactant is used to drive the drop of color into a ring. The process is repeated until the surface of the water is covered with concentric rings. The floating colors are then carefully manipulated either by blowing on them directly or through a straw, fanning the colors, or carefully using a human hair to stir the colors. In the 19th century, the Kyoto-based Japanese suminagashi master Tokutaro Yagi developed an alternative method that employed a split piece of bamboo to gently stir the colors, resulting in concentric spiral designs. A sheet of washi paper is then carefully laid onto the water surface to capture the floating design. The paper, which is often made of kozo (paper mulberry), must be unsized and strong enough to withstand being immersed in water without tearing. Another method of marbling more familiar to Europeans and Americans is made on the surface of a viscous mucilage, known as size or sizing in English. While this method is often referred to as \\"Turkish marbling\\" in English and called ebru in modern Turkish, ethnic Turkic peoples were not the only practitioners of the art, as Persian, Tajiks, and people of Indian origin also made these papers. The use of the term Turkish by Europeans is most likely due to both the fact that many first encountered the art in Istanbul, as well as essentialist references to all Muslims as Turks, much as Europeans were referred to as Firengi in Turkish and Persian, which literally means Frankish. Historic forms of marbling used both organic and inorganic pigments mixed with water for colors, and sizes were traditionally made from gum tragacanth (Astragalus spp.), gum karaya, guar gum, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum- graecum), fleabane, linseed, and psyllium. Since the late 19th century, a boiled extract of the carrageenan-rich alga known as Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), has been employed for sizing. Today, many marblers use powdered carrageenan extracted from various seaweeds. Another plant-derived mucilage is made from sodium alginate. In recent years, a synthetic size made from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, a common ingredient in instant wallpaper paste, is often used as a size for floating acrylic and oil paints. In the size-based method, colors made from pigments are mixed with a surfactant such as ox gall. Sometimes, oil or turpentine may be added to a color, to achieve special effects. The colors are then spattered or dropped onto the size, one color after another until there is a dense pattern of several colors. Straw from the broom corn was used to make a kind of whisk for sprinkling the paint, or horsehair to create a kind of drop-brush. Each successive layer of pigment spreads slightly less than the last, and the colors may require additional surfactant to float and uniformly expand. Once the colors are laid down, various tools and implements such as rakes, combs, and styluses are often used in a series of movements to create more intricate designs. Paper or cloth is often mordanted beforehand with aluminium sulfate (alum) and gently laid onto the floating colors (although methods such as Turkish ebru and Japanese suminagashi do not require mordanting). The colors are thereby transferred and adhered to the surface of the paper or material. The paper or material is then carefully lifted off the size and hung up to dry. Some marblers gently drag the paper over a rod to draw off the excess size. If necessary, excess bleeding colors and sizing can be rinsed off, and then the paper or fabric is allowed to dry. After the print is made, any color residues remaining on the size are carefully skimmed off of the surface, in order to clear it before starting a new pattern. Contemporary marblers employ a variety of modern materials, some in place of or in combination with the more traditional ones. A wide variety of colors are used today in place of the historic pigment colors. Plastic broom straw can be used instead of broom corn, as well as bamboo sticks, plastic pipettes, and eye droppers to drop the colors on the surface of the size. Ox gall is still commonly used as a surfactant for watercolors and gouache, but synthetic surfactants are used in conjunction with acrylic, PVA, and oil-based paints.  History in East Asia  waka poems by ≈åshik≈çchi Mitsune (859?‚Äì925?). 20 cm height, 32 cm wide. Silver, Gold, Color, and ink on suminagashi paper. From a copy of the Sanjurokunin Kashu or \\"Thirty-Six Immortal Poets\\" kept in the Hongan-ji Temple, Kyoto. This multi- volume manuscript, which contains the oldest examples of marbled paper known today, was presented to the Emperor Shirakawa on his sixtieth birthday in 1112 CE (Narita, 14 and Chambers, 13‚Äì16). An intriguing reference which some think may be a form of marbling is found in a compilation completed in 986 CE entitled ÊñáÊàøÂõõË∞± (Wen Fang Si Pu) or \\"Four Treasures of the Scholar's Study\\" edited by the 10th century scholar-official ËòáÊòìÁ∞° Su Yijian (957‚Äì995 CE). This compilation contains information on inkstick, inkstone, ink brush, and paper in China, which are collectively called the four treasures of the study. The text mentions a kind of decorative paper called ÊµÅÊ≤ôÁÆã Liu Sha Jian meaning ‚Äúdrifting-sand‚Äù or ‚Äúflowing-sand notepaper\\" that was made in what is now the region of Sichuan (Su 4: 7a‚Äì8a). This paper was made by dragging a piece of paper through a fermented flour paste mixed with various colors, creating a free and irregular design. A second type was made with a paste prepared from honey locust pods, mixed with croton oil, and thinned with water. Presumably, both black and colored inks were employed. Ginger, possibly in the form of an oil or extract, was used to disperse the colors, or ‚Äúscatter‚Äù them, according to the interpretation given by T.H. Tsien. The colors were said to gather together when a hair-brush was beaten over the design, as dandruff particles was applied to the design by beating a hairbrush over top. The finished designs, which were thought to resemble human figures, clouds, or flying birds, were then transferred to the surface of a sheet of paper. An example of paper decorated with floating ink has never been found in China. Whether or not the above methods employed floating colors remains to be determined (Tsien 94‚Äì5). Su Yijian was an Imperial scholar-official and served as the chief of the Hanlin Academy from about 985‚Äì993 CE. He compiled the work from a wide variety of earlier sources and was familiar with the subject, given his profession. Yet it is important to note that it is uncertain how personally acquainted he was with the various methods for making decorative papers that he compiled. He most likely reported information given to him, without having a full understanding of the methods used. His original sources may have predated him by several centuries. Not only is it necessary to identify the original source to attribute a firm date for the information, but also the account remains uncorroborated due to a lack of any surviving physical evidence of marbling in Chinese manuscripts. An example of suminagashi paper used as an element in traditional ink wash painting. From the National Treasure Fan-shaped album of the Hokeky≈ç Sutra (Lotus Sutra), Heian period 12th c. CE, currently kept in the Shitenn≈ç-ji Temple in Osaka. In contrast, Suminagashi (Â¢®ÊµÅ„Åó), which means \\"floating ink\\" in Japanese, appears to be the earliest form of marbling during the 12th-century Sanjuurokuninshuu (‰∏âÂçÅÂÖ≠‰∫∫ÈõÜ), located in Nishihonganji (Ë•øÊú¨È°òÂØ∫), Kyoto. Author Einen Miura states that the oldest reference to suminagashi papers are in the waka poems of Shigeharu, (825‚Äì880 CE), a son of the famed Heian era poet Narihira (Muira 14) in the Kokin Wakash≈´, but the verse has not been identified and even if found, it may be spurious. Various claims have been made regarding the origins of suminagashi. Some think that may have derived from an early form of ink divination (encromancy). Another theory is that the process may have derived from a form of popular entertainment at the time, in which a freshly painted Sumi painting was immersed into water, and the ink slowly dispersed from the paper and rose to the surface, forming curious designs, but no physical evidence supporting these allegations has ever been identified. According to legend, Jizemon Hiroba is credited as the inventor of suminagashi. It is said that he felt divinely inspired to make suminagashi paper after he offered spiritual devotions at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara Prefecture. He then wandered the country looking for the best water with which to make his papers. He arrived in Echizen, Fukui Prefecture where he found the water especially conducive to making suminagashi. So he settled there, and his family carried on with the tradition to this day. The Hiroba Family claims to have made this form of marbled paper since 1151 CE for 55 generations (Narita, 14).  History in the Islamic World  This calligraphic panel features a verse from the Qur'an (14:7), and is typical of compositions written upon marbled paper produced after the 16th century in Central Asia, Iran, India, and Turkey. The method of floating colors on the surface of mucilaginous sizing is thought to have emerged in the regions of Greater Iran and Central Asia by the late 15th century. It may have first appeared during the end of the Timurid Dynasty, whose final capital was in the city of Herat, located in Afghanistan today. Other sources suggest it emerged during the subsequent Shaybanid dynasty, in the cities of Samarqand or Bukhara, in what is now modern Uzbekistan. Whether or not this method was somehow related to earlier Chinese or Japanese methods mentioned above has never been concretely proven. The Persianate method, known as kƒÅgha·∫ï-e abrƒ´ (ŸÉÿßÿ∫ÿ∞ ÿßÿ®ÿ±Ÿâ), in Persian or often by the simplified form of abrƒ´ (ÿßÿ®ÿ±Ÿâ), is attested in several historical accounts. Annemarie Schimmel translated this term as \\"clouded paper\\" in English. While Sami Frash√´ri claimed in his Kamus-ƒ± T√ºrki, that the term was \\"more properly derived from the Chagatai word ebre\\" (ÿßÿ®ÿ±Ÿá); he provided no example of usage to support this assertion. In contrast, most historical Persian, Turkish, and Urdu texts refer to the paper as abrƒ´ alone. Today in Turkey, the art is commonly known as ebru, a cognate of the term abri first documented in the 19th century. In modern Iran, it is often called abr-o-b√¢d (ÿßÿ®ÿ±Ÿà ÿ®ÿßÿØ), meaning \\"cloud and wind\\". The art first emerged and evolved during the long 16th century in the Safavid Persia and Ottoman Turkey, as well as Mughal and the Deccan Sultanates in India. Within these regions, various methods emerged in which colors were made to float on the surface of a bath of viscous liquid mucilage or size, made from various plants. These include katheera or kitre- gum tragacanth (Astragalus often used as a binder by apothecaries in making tablets), shambal√Æleh or methi- fenugreek seed (an ingredient in curry mixtures), and sahlab or salep (the roots of \\"Orchis mascula\\", which is commonly used to make a popular beverage). A pair of leaves bearing rudimentary drop-motifs are considered among the earliest examples of this paper, held in the Kronos Collection. One of the sheets bears an accession notation on the reverse stating \\"These abris are rare\\" (€åÿßÿØ ÿØÿßÿ¥ÿ™ ÿß€åŸÜ ÿßÿ®ÿ±€åŸáÿß€å ŸÜÿßÿØÿ±Ÿá ÿßÿ≥ÿ™) and adds that it was \\"among the gifts from Iran\\" to the royal library of Ghiyath Shah, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate, dated Hijri year 1 Dhu al-Hijjah 901/11 August 1496 of the Common Era. Approximately a century later, a variant approach using different tools and including rakes, combs, and other apparatus were used to manipulate both finely prepared mineral and organic pigments, resulting in more elaborate, intricate, and mesmerizing designs. In India, the abri technique was combined with 'aks, masking with resist or stencils, to create a unique and very rare form of miniature painting, attributed to the Deccan plateau region of India and especially the city of Bijapur in particular, during the Adil Shahi dynasty in the 17th century. The topic of marbling in India is understudied and conclusive determinations have yet to be made, especially in light of discoveries made in the last 20 years. The earliest examples of Ottoman marbled paper may be the margins attached to a cut paper d√©coupage manuscript of the H√¢ln√¢ma (ÿ≠ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßŸÖŸá) by the poet Arifi (popularly known as the G√ª-yi √áevg√¢n [Ball and Polo-stick]) completed by Mehmed bin Gazanfer in 1539‚Äì40. One early master by the name of Shebek is mentioned posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the art known as the Tert√Æb-i Ris√¢le-yi Ebr√Æ (ÿ™ÿ±ÿ™€åÿ®Ÿê ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ€Ä ÿßÿ®ÿ±€å, an Arrangement of a Treatise on Ebr√Æ), which based on internal evidence dates to after 1615. Several recipes described in the text are attributed to this master. Another famous 18th- century master by the name of Hatip Mehmed Efendi (died 1773) is accredited with developing motif and perhaps early floral designs, although evidence from Iran and India contradicts some of these claims. Despite this, marbled motifs are commonly referred to as \\"Hatip\\" designs today in Turkey. The current Turkish tradition of ebru dates to the mid-19th century, with a series of masters associated with a branch of the Naqshbandi Sufi order based at what is known as the √ñzbekler Tekkesi (Lodge of the Uzbeks), located in Sultantepe, near √úsk√ºdar. The founder of this line is accredited to Sadƒ±k Effendi (died 1846). While the claim that Sadƒ±k Efendi first learned the art in Bukhara and brought it to Istanbul is uncorroborated, he taught it to his sons Edhem and Salƒ±h. Based upon this later practice, many Turkish marblers assert that the art was perpetuated by Sufis for centuries, although clear evidence to support this claim has never been established. \\"Hezarfen\\" Edhem Effendi (died 1904) is attributed with developing the art as a kind of cottage industry for the tekke, to supply Istanbul's burgeoning printing industry with the decorative paper. It is said that the papers were tied into bundles and sold by weight. Many of these papers were of the neftli design, made with turpentine, analogous to what is called stormont in English. The premier student of Edhem Efendi was Necmeddin Okyay (1885‚Äì1976). He was the first to teach the art at the Fine Arts Academy in Istanbul. He is famous for the development of floral styles of marbling, in addition to yazƒ±lƒ± ebru a method of writing traditional calligraphy using a gum-resist method in conjunction with ebru. Okyay's premier student was Mustafa D√ºzg√ºnman (1920‚Äì1990), the teacher of many contemporary marblers in Turkey today. He is known for codifying the traditional repertoire of patterns, to which he only added a floral daisy design, in the manner of his teacher.  History in Europe  The oldest paper marbling business in Venice and most of the western world is Legatorial Piazzesi, dating back to the 15th century. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/things-to-do/shopping-in-venice- unique-venetian-souvenirs-what-to-buy-and-where/marble-paper/ps56932688.cms In the 17th century European travelers to the Middle East collected examples of these papers and bound them into alba amicorum, which literally means \\"books of friendship\\" in Latin, and is a forerunner of the modern autograph album. Eventually the technique for making the papers reached Europe, where they became a popular covering material not only for book covers and end-papers, but also for lining chests, drawers, and bookshelves. The marbling of the edges of books was also a European adaptation of the art. The methods of marbling attracted the curiosity of early scientists during the Renaissance. The earliest published account in Europe was written in Dutch by Gerhard ter Brugghen in his Verlichtery kunst-boeck in Amsterdam in 1616, while the first German account was written by Daniel Schwenter, published posthumously in his Delic√¶ Physico-Mathematic√¶ in 1671 (Wolfe, 16). Athanasius Kircher published a Latin account in Ars Magna Lucis et Umbr√¶ in Rome in 1646, which was widely disseminated throughout Europe. A thorough overview of the art with illustrations of marblers at work, and images of the tools of the trade was published in the Encyclop√©die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The art became a popular handicraft in the 19th century after the English maker Charles Woolnough published his The Art of Marbling (1853). In it, he describes how he adapted a method of marbling onto book-cloth, which he exhibited at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851. (Wolfe, 79) Further developments in the art were made by Josef Halfer, a bookbinder of German origin, who lived in Budakeszi, in Hungary. Halfer discovered a method for preserving carrageenan, and his methods superseded earlier ones in Europe and the US.

Aside from continued traditional applications, artists now explore using the method as a kind of painting technique, and as an element in collage. In the last two decades, marbling has been the subject of international symposia and museum exhibitions. The first International Marblers' Gathering was held in Santa Fe NM in 1989 sponsored by the marbling journal Ink & Gall. Active international groups can be found on social media networks such as Facebook and also the International Marbling Network. Marbling has been adapted for temporary decoration of hands and faces for events such as festivals. Neon or ultraviolet reactive colours are typically used, and the paint is water-based and non-toxic.  Examples  File:Marbled endpaper, between 1720 and 1770, from Quintilian ed.

She is best known for her back-to- back wins in France's most prestigious horse race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.  Racing career  Corrida in Latin languages translates as bullfight. At age two, she won the Prix Morny and was second by a head to Pampeiro in the Grand Crit√©rium. At age three, owner Marcel Boussac shipped Corrida to England, where trainer George Lambton prepared her at Newmarket Racecourse. Entered in the 1,000 Guineas and The Oaks, Corrida performed poorly, and after a third lackluster effort was returned to France. There, Corrida won the Grand Prix de Marseille at Hippodrome de Marseille Borely and had three placings in major races including a third in the 1935 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In 1936, she blossomed into the most dominant horse in France. That year, Corrida won seven major races. In England, she captured the Hardwicke Stakes at Ascot Racecourse, then won the Grand Prix Prince Rose at Hippodrome Wellington, in Ostend, Belgium and in France the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, the Prix d'H√©douville, the Prix du Prince de Galles, and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, and repeated her win in the Grand Prix de Marseille. In 1937, Corrida returned to Belgium to win her second straight Grand International d'Ostende and traveled to Berlin, Germany, where she won the Grosser Preis von Reichshauptstadt. In October at Hippodrome de Longchamp in Paris, she continued to dominate the colts, becoming the first female horse to ever win the 1¬Ω mile Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe twice.  Retirement  Corrida was retired to her owner's Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard breeding farm in Neuvy- au-Houlme in Lower Normandy. She was bred to the champion sire Tourbillon and produced Coaraze, who won a number of important French races, including the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Coaraze was her only offspring to survive the German occupation of France in World War II. Following the D-Day landing at Normandy by the Allied Forces, Corrida disappeared from the pasture at Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard during the Battle of the Falaise Gap. No trace of her was ever found.

He became a personal friend of country star Chet Atkins. Biography Early life Marcel Dadi was born in Sousse, Tunisia on 20 August 1951. Dadi, along with his immediate family, moved to Paris, France in 1954. In 1961, he started playing guitar at age 10. He had joined Andre Assouline, Joseph Illouz, and Maurice Levy to form a rock instrumental band by 1964. He was inspired by the music of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, He continued to expand his musical horizons with the influence of a guitarist, Bernard Photzer, who introduced him to the music of Elvis Presley and other 1950's rockers. Photzer also taught him the rudiments of flatpicking. As a soloist with French singer-songwriter and guitarist, Hugues Aufray, Dadi began to develop his own approach to flatpicking. From 1972, he wrote instructional articles for Folk Music Review, wherein he introduced his rigorous training method, which utilizes a fingering chart, in the March 1972 issue. Career Dadi released several LPs and some instructional videos before his early death. His recordings featured a mix of compositions by his American heroes and original compositions of his own in a similar style. A feature of his early LPs was that they included a tablature booklet, allowing guitarists to learn the tunes for themselves. Dadi often recorded tunes dedicated to his friends, such as \\"Roger Chesterfield,\\" dedicated to Roger C. Field with whom he first went to Nashville in 1975 to visit Chet Atkins.

Among the most acclaimed Chinese-language poets of his generation, he has been repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. In addition to poetry, he is the author of short fiction, essays, and a memoir. Known as a dissident, he is a prominent representative of a school of poetry known variously in the West as \\"Misty\\" or \\"Obscure\\" Poetry. Born in Beijing before the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Bei Dao served as a member of the Red Guards in his youth. However, disillusioned by the Cultural Revolution, he participated in the 1976 Tiananmen Incident and co-founded an influential literary journal, called Jintian (Today), that came to be officially banned in China. After his poetry and activism were an inspiration to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Bei Dao was banned from China and entered a period of exile in the West, living and teaching in numerous countries before settling in the United States. He has been allowed to return to mainland China since 2006, but has not done so except for brief visits. In 2007, he joined the faculty of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 2009, he became an American citizen. Bei Dao has been described as having played a significant role in creating a new form of poetry in Chinese literature, one that is often viewed as a reaction to the artistic strictures of the Mao era. In particular, his poetry is known for linguistic experimentation and an embrace of complexity, even paradox, in its exploration of individuality. Currently, Bei Dao resides in Hong Kong, where he is an Honorary Professor of Humanities at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Biography  Family and early life  Bei Dao was born in Beijing, China, on August 2, 1949. He is the eldest of three children of Zhao Jinian (d. 2003), an insurance executive, and Zhao Mei Li (n√©e Sun), a medical doctor. Bei Dao was born into a notable family. On his father's side, he traces his lineage to the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, when his ancestor, Zhao Bingyan, was the provincial governor of Hunan and deputy minister of justice. During the Taiping Rebellion, his great-great grandfather, Zhao Jingxian, gained fame for defending the city of Huzhou against a rebel siege for more than two years. When the Xianfeng Emperor was informed of his death, he issued an imperial decree of praise, ordered reparations paid to the family, established an ancestral hall for the family in Huzhou, and recorded Zhao Jingxian's life in the Official Archive of National History. Bei Dao's great- grandfather was director of the Guangdong Manufacturing Bureau and retired as director of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. However, due to war and internal strife in China, the family's fortune declined, and his paternal grandfather earned a modest living selling paintings and scrolls before dying when Bei Dao's father was still a child. While his father's side of the family had been defenders and beneficiaries of the Qing Dynasty, Bei Dao's maternal side of the family played a role in overthrowing the empire. His maternal grandfather, Sun Haixia, was a member of the Tongmenghui society founded by Sun Yat-sen, who eventually became provisional president of post-imperial China. During the Wuchang Uprising, Sun Haixia was hailed as a hero for seizing a key telegraph station. In addition to founding a secondary school in Hubei, he later served as director of the telecommunications bureau of Chengdu and then directed the telecommunications bureau of Shanghai. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, one of Bei Dao's maternal aunts was personal nurse to Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing. Among his uncles, one was a deputy mayor of Wuhan, and another was vice chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, one of eight political parties officially permitted in the People's Republic of China. Bei Dao's father was self-educated and passed a test to gain employment at a bank. He was later a co-founder of the People's Insurance Company of China and a deputy secretary for propaganda for the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), a political party. Bei Dao's parents married in Shanghai and settled in Beijing the year before the poet's birth. They lived in the city's Xicheng District, which borders the Forbidden City and has been known as a home to the middle and upper classes. Bei Dao grew up on Sanbulao (\\"Three Never Old\\") Hutong, a street named for its most famous resident, Admiral Zheng He. Despite his parents' professional status, Bei Dao did not have a carefree upbringing. Due to the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" policies of Mao Zedong, which shifted resources toward securing a socialist society, Bei Dao's father was assigned to manage academic affairs for the newly established Central Institute of Socialism and the family experienced the hardships of the Great Chinese Famine. Writing in his memoir, City Gate, Open Up, Bei Dao describes his memory of that period: > Hunger gradually devoured our lives. Dropsy became commonplace. Everyone's > usual greeting to each other changed from \\"Have you eaten yet\\" to \\"Have you > gotten dropsy yet,\\" then the pant legs were pulled up and each used their > fingers to test the other's degree of illness. Like many Chinese youth, Bei Dao joined the Young Pioneers of China. He attended Beijing Middle School No. 13, where his teachers praised his writing. He then tested into the elite Beijing No. 4 High School. However, he was unable to graduate: in 1966, when Bei Dao was sixteen, Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution, which closed the school. (In 2011, upon receiving an honorary doctorate from Brown University, Bei Dao remarked that it was the first degree he had ever received.)  Cultural Revolution  Red Guards in Tiananmen Square, 1966 Having not been selected for induction into the People's Liberation Army, Bei Dao spent the first two years of the Cultural Revolution immersed in political activities as a member of a Red Guard faction based at his high school. Initially, he created posters denouncing his former teachers. He led a group of teenagers in publicly shaming a neighbor, forcibly shaving the man's head in the street and briefly imprisoning him. He moved into a dormitory at his high school, which became a hub for revolutionary activity, hosting various committees and \\"struggle sessions\\". The students there formed a commune composed of two Red Guard factions dedicated to promoting the ideals of the revolution, for which Bei Dao assisted in disseminating propaganda. On a regional tour in 1966, he and his fellow Red Guard members helped bring an end to a siege of the Anting train station by anti-Maoist protestors, an incident that gave rise to the Shanghai People's Commune. Later, during the \\"Down to the Countryside\\" movement, he joined delegations to observe education efforts outside Beijing. In 1967, the Communist Party of China officially disavowed the Red Guards due to their frequently violent tactics and disruptive effect on the national economy, and by the following year had largely succeeded in dismantling the movement. Bei Dao, like many former Red Guard members, was assigned to \\"re-education through labor\\". Beginning in 1969, he spent the remainder of the Cultural Revolution as a member of a construction crew outside of Beijing. As a result of this experience, during which he lived among the poor, he came to reject Maoist policies and communist propaganda. By the early 1970s, Bei Dao began to focus on writing. His early poems drew praise from the acclaimed poet Bing Xin, to whom Bei Dao's father reported at the CAPD. During visits to Beijing, his home became a gathering place for friends and aspiring artists. These meetings were monitored by the neighborhood political committee, and on one occasion police raided the home of one member of the group. To avoid drawing attention, Bei Dao wrote alone in his kitchen late at night. In 1974, he composed the first draft of his novella, \\"Waves,\\" in a darkroom under the guise that he was developing photographs. Overall, the Cultural Revolution was a tumultuous period for Bei Dao and his family. Like him, his siblings were sent away on \\"re-education through labor\\" assignments. His parents were sent to May Seventh Cadre School to undergo \\"ideological thought reform\\"; accused of living a bourgeois lifestyle (for, among other things, employing a nanny) they faced isolation, interrogation, and hard labor. The family was thus separated for much of the decade that Cultural Revolution policies were in force. In 1968, Bei Dao's aunt committed suicide after she became the focus of a government investigation. In July 1976, his sister died while attempting to rescue a drowning person. In his memoir, Bei Dao writes, \\"At this pivotal point in my life, I tried to reassess the past and peer into the future, but everything seemed fuzzy, indiscernible, my heart empty, vacuous\\".  1976 Tiananmen Incident and aftermath  A section of Beijing's Democracy Wall, 1979 A watershed event occurred in April 1976, when the government's attempt to minimize public mourning for the death of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai led to protests in Tiananmen Square‚Äîthe first significant anti-government protests since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Bei Dao participated in the demonstrations, which were violently suppressed. Inspired by his experience, he wrote what became his most famous poem, \\"The Answer,\\" which has been compared to Bob Dylan's \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" for its impact on a generation of Chinese. Written with defiant language, and extolling human agency, the poem has been described as a refusal of restrictions like those adopted during the Cultural Revolution. After the death of Mao and the arrest of the \\"Gang of Four\\" in the latter half of 1976, the Cultural Revolution came to an end, ushering in a relaxation of government control of speech. Bei Dao and his friend, the poet Mang Ke, assembled the literary journal Jintian (Today), working with mimeographs. The first issue appeared in 1978 and was distributed by hand or posted, as broadsides, on what came to be known as Beijing's \\"Democracy Wall\\". It featured Bei Dao's poem, \\"The Answer,\\" as well as a short story he wrote. To avoid governmental scrutiny, he published under a pseudonym, Bei Dao, \\"Northern Island,\\" chosen by his friend Mang Ke because Bei Dao hailed from the north of China and preferred solitude. The journal was notable for its literary quality: in its pages, readers were introduced to a group of poets‚Äîincluding Gu Cheng, Duo Duo, Yang Lian, and Shu Ting, among others‚Äîwhom Chinese critics dubbed \\"menglong\\", which has been translated in English as \\"misty\\" or \\"obscure\\", in reference to their embrace of complexity and rejection of the Maoist principles of socialist realism. \\"The Answer,\\" in particular, spread through the Chinese underground and vaulted Bei Dao to national fame. Bei Dao continued to publish poetry and short fiction in Jintian, which appeared irregularly until Chinese authorities banned it in 1980. In the same year, he married the artist Shao Fei and moved out of his childhood home. He also transitioned away from employment in construction after eleven years‚Äîfive years as a concrete mixer and six as an ironworker. He found work as a journalist, writing for the magazine China Report. He also translated Western poets into Chinese. Bei Dao's poetry appeared in the officially approved Chinese journal Shi Kan (Poetry Monthly) during the \\"Democracy Wall\\" era of 1978-1980. His poems first appeared in English translation in 1983, when they were featured in the journal Renditions, published by the Chinese University Press. In the same year, a collection of his poems was published as Notes from the City of the Sun by the Cornell University East Asia Program as part of its \\"East Asia Papers\\" series. The following year, his poems appeared in English in the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars. During the years 1983-84, his work was banned in China due to a government campaign to combat \\"spiritual pollution\\". When that campaign ended, his work appeared again in Chinese in a Communist Party publication called An Anthology of New Trends in Poetry, which Bei Dao has credited with having \\"a profound and wide-reaching influence\\" in China. In 1985, a selection of his work was included in an English-language anthology called Contemporary Chinese Literature, while his story collection, Waves, was published in Chinese by the Chinese University Press. Collectively, these publications introduced Bei Dao to scholars in the West, and he received an invitation to visit Europe in 1985. In the same year, his daughter, whom he nicknamed Tiantian, was born. In 1986, his collected poems appeared in Chinese. By the spring of 1987, he had taken up a post as a visiting lecturer at Durham University in England.  Events of 1989  In the fall of 1988, Bei Dao and his wife and daughter returned to Beijing. In his home, he and his colleagues drafted a petition calling for the release of pro-democracy activists like Wei Jingsheng. Bei Dao and over thirty colleagues signed and publicly released the document in February 1989. When the government denounced the petition, Bei Dao and fellow activists held a press conference to announce an organized effort to promote democracy and human rights in China. In April 1989, when student- led protests erupted in Tiananmen Square, Bei Dao was in San Francisco, taking part in a conference. \\"Every day,\\" he has written, \\"my eyes were fixed on the developments of the situation at home\\". Protestors recited or displayed lines of Bei Dao's poetry‚Äîparticularly from his poems \\"The Answer\\" and \\"Declaration\\"‚Äîon posters and banners. The next month, he was in the Netherlands for a meeting of PEN International, where his presence on stage caused the Chinese delegation to leave in protest. On June 4, 1989, when the Chinese military forcibly ended the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, resulting in a mass number of casualties, Bei Dao was in West Berlin as a writer-in- residence at the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program. He has described that day as \\"a nightmare\\" that left him \\"utterly dejected\\". Citing Bei Dao's influence via his advocacy and writing, the Chinese government banned him from returning to China. His wife and daughter remained in Beijing and were prevented from joining him. Several other Misty Poets were also exiled: Gu Cheng, Duo Duo, and Yang Lian. Speaking to foreign television outlets upon her escape from China, the student protest leader Chai Ling demonstrated the influence of Bei Dao's work when she quoted from his poem, \\"Declaration\\": \\"I will not kneel on the ground / allowing the executioners to look tall / the better to obscure the wind of freedom\\".  Exile  Rue de Venise, where Bei Dao lived in Paris Stranded in Europe, Bei Dao moved from one country to another. After his term as a visiting writer in West Berlin, he spent much of 1990 in Scandinavia, where, in Oslo, he and fellow exiles decided to revive Jintian as an √©migr√© journal. His forced exile garnered global media attention as well as increased interest in his work. For example, in addition to invitations to speak at international literary conferences, two collections of his work appeared in the United States simultaneously: a poetry collection, The August Sleepwalker, and a fiction collection, Waves. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, the sinologist Jonathan Spence praised the books as \\"powerful\\" and \\"astonishing and beautiful\\". In 1991, Bei Dao relocated to Paris, where he lived on Rue de Venise, across from the Pompidou Center. Another poetry collection, Old Snow, appeared in English that year. For the 1992-93 academic year, Bei Dao was a writer-in-residence at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Back in Paris in the summer of 1993, he co-founded the International Parliament of Writers, an organization dedicated to assisting authors in need of refuge or asylum. In the fall of 1993, he was appointed the McCandless Chair in the Humanities at Eastern Michigan University. The following year, he was a visiting faculty member at the University of Michigan. His third poetry collection to appear in English, Forms of Distance, was then published. While he received support from numerous institutions and individuals, his separation from family weighed heavily; he has spoken of the emotional distress he experienced during this period. In 1994, he attempted to return to China, but was detained on his arrival at Beijing Capital International Airport and then deported. In 1995, he accepted a one-year faculty position at the University of California at Davis. That year, he was reunited with his wife and daughter, who were permitted to leave China, and he was able to see his parents during a visit to Paris. His fourth poetry collection to be published in English, Landscape Over Zero, also appeared in 1995. In all, buoyed by a Guggenheim Fellowship, he remained in Davis, California, for five years. He and his wife ultimately divorced and his daughter returned to Beijing to continue her education. For the 2000-01 academic year, Bei Dao took up an appointment as the Lois and Willard Mackey Chair in Creative Writing at Beloit College. During that year, an essay collection, Blue House, and a poetry collection, Unlock, were published in English. In 2001, after his father became seriously ill, Bei Dao was granted permission to visit him in Beijing; his visit in December of that year marked his first time in China since 1989. The experience prompted him to begin work on a memoir about his youth. In 2002, Bei Dao joined a delegation from the International Parliament of Writers‚Äîincluding Russell Banks, Jos√© Saramago, Wole Soyinka, Breyten Breytenbach, Vincenzo Consolo, Juan Goytisolo, and Christian Salmon‚Äîfor a visit to the poet Mahmoud Darwish in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. The visit caused a diplomatic row between Israel and Portugal after Israel objected to Jos√© Saramago's public characterization of Israeli policy toward Palestinians. The visit garnered further attention when the delegation met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Bei Dao described the trip in an essay, \\"Midnight's Gate\\", which became the title of a collection of essays that appeared in English in 2005. Between 2002 and 2005, Bei Dao was based primarily in New York City. He taught at Stony Brook University, and spent a semester as a visiting writer at the University of Alabama. During this period, he remarried and had a son. From 2005 to 2007, he was a writer-in-residence at the University of Notre Dame.  Hong Kong and latest work  Bei Dao with Syrian poet Adunis, 2011 In 2006, the Chinese government allowed Bei Dao to return permanently to China. However, in 2007, he moved to Hong Kong instead, where he was offered a permanent faculty position at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. His visits to the mainland have been rare. For example, in 2011 he made a surprise visit to the Qinghai Lake International Poetry Festival, where he was swarmed by admirers. In 2009, he became a naturalized American citizen. In 2010, his memoir, City Gate, Open Up, appeared in Chinese (it appeared in English in 2017), and in the same year a retrospective of his poetry, The Rose of Time: New and Selected Poems, was published in English. Beginning in 2014, Bei Dao served as editor for a series of books for children, an initiative he undertook after he was disappointed by the quality of poetry his son was taught in school. In addition to his teaching, Bei Dao has organized two poetry initiatives in Hong Kong: in 2009, he launched International Poetry Nights in Hong Kong, which, since 2017, has been under the auspices of the Hong Kong Poetry Festival Foundation; he also launched a visiting writer series in cooperation with the Lee Hysan Foundation, which brings two foreign authors to Hong Kong each year and publishes their work in Chinese through Oxford University Press.  Personal life  Bei Dao has one daughter from his first marriage to the artist Shao Fei. He lives with his current wife and their son in Hong Kong. In addition to writing and teaching, he pursues photography, and has exhibited his photographs at the Hong Kong Contemporary Art Museum in Beijing. In his essay collections, Bei Dao has written about the many friendships he has made during his travels, including with notable literary figures such as Allen Ginsberg, Susan Sontag, Breyten Breytenbach, Tomas Transtr√∂mer, Gary Snyder, and others.  Honors  Bei Dao has won numerous awards for his writing. Honors bestowed for his body of work include: * PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award (United States, 1990) * Tucholsky Prize (Sweden, 1990) * American Academy of Arts and Letters, Honorary Member (1996) * Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts (United States, 1998) * Argana International Poetry Award (Morocco, 2002) * Jeanette Schocken Literary Prize (Germany, 2005) * Honorary Doctorate, Brown University (2011) * Cikada Prize (Sweden, 2014) * Golden Wreath Award of the Struga Poetry Evenings (North Macedonia, 2015) Since his exile from China, Bei Dao has been mentioned in the press as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, with various sources claiming that he has been nominated for the prize numerous times. On at least one occasion, rumors drew reporters to his home in anticipation that he would win. In 1996, he was a finalist for the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and in 2008 he was named a Puterbaugh Fellow at the University of Oklahoma. Bei Dao has been, and continues to be, a featured speaker at institutions and cultural events around the world, including the Poetry International Festival Rotterdam, the Prague Writers' Festival, the PEN World Voices Festival, and many others. His books have been translated into more than 30 languages, and his poems have been widely anthologized.  Work  Due largely to his personal story, Bei Dao's writing has frequently been viewed through the lens of politics, a practice the poet has positioned himself against, arguing that \\"true resistance lies in allowing poetry to separate itself from politics, leaving behind the language of states and thus freeing itself from the vicious circle of history\\". Elsewhere, he has bemoaned that journalists and critics have written about him as a political figure. Yet the prominent scholar of Bei Dao's work, Bonnie S. McDougall, has noted the nuanced relationship of his work to politics: \\"The central force of Bei Dao's poetry has been his complex reaction to the pressures of a brutalized, conformist, and corrupt society‚Ä¶asserting his individuality in an apolitical mode that was ultimately subversive\\". As the poet and historian Julian Gewirtz put it, Bei Dao is \\"a poet of political consequence, if not always quite a political poet\\".  Form  The foremost of Bei Dao's methods of subverting literary norms in his native China has been through form. In China, expectations for art and artists were set forth at the 1942 Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, where Mao Zedong described his view that all art is political and art in China should be connected to, and ultimately uplift, the masses. For poetry, this meant a reliance on classical and folk models with clearly comprehensible verses meant to inspire social morality as well as faith in communism. By contrast, Bei Dao rarely makes use of conventional poetic forms. As McDougall notes, he has \\"sought to find new formal devices within the general category of 'free verse'‚Ä¶Conventional but dispensable grammatical forms and punctuation disappear between intensely compressed images; subject, tense, and number are elusive; transitions are unclear; order and logic are supplied by the reader\\". By using such an experimental approach, Bei Dao has achieved what the poet and critic Michael Palmer has called \\"a poetry of complex enfoldings and crossings, of sudden juxtapositions and fractures, of pattern in a dance with randomness\\". This approach to poetic form earned Bei Dao his moniker as a \\"misty\\" poet, which was originally leveled pejoratively by Chinese critics who disliked his work for its lack of clarity. Some critics in the West have similarly found his work to be incomprehensible. In response, McDougall places Bei Dao's approach in context: \\"The so-called obscurity or bizarreness of his writing is‚Ä¶not simply adopted for reasons of expedience but is an emotional necessity\\" given the milieu in which he began to write. She elaborates that \\"his verse is not obscure just because of fear of censorship but because the pain caused by all forms of oppression is so intense that conventional epithets are too shallow to express it\\".  Themes  Bei Dao's approach to form has been said to reflect his major thematic concerns. Primary among these is his exploration of individuality, often embodied in a presentation of complexity and paradox. Palmer has described the work of Bei Dao‚Äîand of all of the Misty Poets‚Äîas \\"a complex interweaving of inner and outer worlds, the private and the public, the personal and the official, the oneiric and the quotidian, the classical and the contemporary\\". Similarly, the scholar Dian Li argues that Bei Dao's embrace of paradox is rooted in both Western tradition‚Äîe.g., Plato's Parmenides‚Äîand Eastern tradition‚Äîe.g., popular folk tales like one about a blacksmith who creates both an invincible sword and an impenetrable shield‚Äîand by placing opposites together, one can arrive at a truth that is \\"multiple, undifferentiated, and indeterminate\\". Or, as Bei Dao has said, \\"There are many principles in the world, and many of these principles contradict each other. Tolerance for the existence of another's principle is the basis for your own existence\\". By embracing the complexity of the world, in other words, one arrives at individuality. McDougall argues that this preoccupation in Bei Dao's work is \\"not a pretended or temporary escape from society\\" but rather \\"a commitment to non-political communication between people and the realization of the self\\". Another of Bei Dao's recurrent themes is language and its recovery from the political realm. According to the scholar Vera Schwarcz, the Cultural Revolution's use of manifestos, slogans, and propaganda, with their underlying threat of oppression and violence, turned even innocent imagery (the sun and sky, for example) into ominous symbols. Bei Dao's project has thus been to reclaim language for the imagination, to create, as the scholar Claudia Pozzana has termed it, \\"an independent space for poetry\\". He has done this by expressly rejecting the political co-opting of certain words, as he does in his famous \\"I don't believe\\" declarations from \\"The Answer\\". In addition, an attempt to reclaim language can be seen in what Schwarcz calls \\"the stammering quality of Bei Dao's vernacular\\", through which the short, elusive nature of his verse attempts to mirror his personal experience and challenges political descriptions of the world.  Influences  Bei Dao has written of the influence on his early work of the Chinese poet Guo Lusheng (also known as \\"Shi Zhi\\"), whom he counts as an important precursor to the Misty Poets. In his youth, due to government restrictions and an abbreviated education, his exposure to Western literature was limited. In interviews, he has pointed to the influence of the Spanish modernist poets Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Rafael Alberti, Vicente Aleixandre, and Antonio Machado, the Russian poets Boris Pasternak and Osip Mandelstam, and in particular the German- language poet Paul Celan.

La storia dello Stato islamico raccontata dai suoi disertori, Gabriele Del Grande, Milano, 2020 ISIL activity According to Ibrahim Muslem, a human-rights activist quoted by The Wall Street Journal, \\"Abu Luqman decides who gets the oil\\". At Mr. Luqman's discretion, smugglers pay for fuel and load it into tanker trucks. Refined products from the Akrish refinery are driven more than 200 miles to Syrian villages near the Turkish border, according to Mr. Muslem. Mohammed al-Saleh, a spokesman for the advocacy group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, quoted in The Wall Street Journal, said Abu Luqman replaced several foreign generals with locals after the loss of the town of Tell Abyad. He was also responsible for the execution of Abu Saad al-Hadram, Jabhat al-Nusra's commander for Raqqa province. 2014 In early 2014, he was ISIL's chief interrogator in Raqqa province. As of April 2014, he was the IS emir of Raqqa province. In this role, he was the primary official responsible for appointing other ISIL leaders, distributing fighters among the various IS fighting fronts, and publicizing ISIL military operations. In mid-2014, he ordered the beheading of two hostages held by ISIL. As of late 2014, he was a member of ISIL's eight-member governing council. His responsibilities for ISIL included frequently traveling across Syria to transfer ISIL prisoners. Also in late 2014, he changed his name when he was reported dead in the press as a security measure. 2015 In early 2015, he was a member of an ISIL governance council chaired by IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. As of early 2015, he was the senior figure in charge of ISIL detention of Western hostages. In June 2015, he was the governor of Aleppo and the security emir for Syria responsible for foreign fighters. Previously as governor of Raqqa, he was responsible for executions. In July 2015, he was reappointed governor of Raqqa and was the de facto chief in Raqqa, overseeing security affairs. As of mid-2015, he was ISIL's overall security amir at a Raqqa detention facility holding more than 1,000 ISIL foreign recruits who had refused to fight. US and UN sanctions On 29 September 2015 he was added to the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals List. The US Department of Treasury further describes his role, saying \\"Al-Shawakh is being designated for acting for or on behalf of ISIL, an entity designated pursuant to E.O. 13224. As of mid-2015, Syrian national al-Shawakh served as ISIL‚Äôs governor for Raqqa, Syria, after having served as ISIL‚Äôs senior security official for Syria and as governor in Aleppo, roles in which he directed combat assignments for foreign fighters. Al-Shawakh was in charge of ISIL‚Äôs detention of foreign hostages, and oversaw the appointment of other ISIL leaders. Al-Shawakh supervised security matters, including executions, interrogations, and transfers of ISIL prisoners, at an Raqqa detention facility used to hold foreign hostages and ISIL foreign recruits who had refused to fight. In mid-2014, al-Shawakh ordered the beheadings of two ISIL hostages. Al-Shawakh also served on a governance council chaired by ISIL leader and U.S. and UN-designated SDGT Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (AKA Dr. Ibrahim al-Badri)\\". He is also sanctioned by the United Nations who said, \\"Ali Musa al-Shawakh was listed on 29 February 2016 pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 2161 (2014) as being associated with Al-Qaida for ‚Äúparticipating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of‚Äù the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al- Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115)\\".

Today, the slopes of Vulcan are now forested, as a result of dormancy since 1994. Vulcan did not exist during the German colonial times, although the agronomist for the New Guinea Company, Richard Parkinson, noticed that a small island in the harbour in 1880 had grown noticeably larger by 1900. During the 1920s the island offered enough new land for Australian colonials to open a sporting club there, with tennis courts. By 1937 Vulcan was its current size and erupted that year, filling the harbour with a thick layer of pumice.

A. Hoopes and a committee of church leaders, including influential Adventist scholar and administrator W. W. Prescott, came to Lincoln, Nebraska in search of land to establish a college in the Mid-West. In September 1891, Union College opened its doors to students with Prescott serving as its first president. The present-day community of College View grew around the college campus. During the 1920s, the college experienced a difficult period due to the shrinking enrollment and budget deficits. In 1939, former Mayor of Lincoln Don Lathrop Love donated money for the college to build an industrial building and established a life annuity with the college a year later. The 1970s saw major expansion of the college, including the construction of the iconic 100-foot clock tower, Everett Dick Administration Building, the college's lab school George Stone School and College View Church. Founded on barren landscape, the college is the location of the Joshua C. Turner Arboretum, a site of the Nebraska Statewide Arboretum, hosting over 100 species of plants.Union's History in Lincoln The college previously owned the radio station KUCV from its 1974 sign-on until 1989, now the flagship station of NET Radio; the call-sign letters are named after the college.

They are used from Christmas trees, on cut flowers, on newly transplanted shrubs, and in other applications to preserve and protect plants from drying out too quickly. They have also been used to protect leaves from salt burn and fungal diseases . They block the active excretion of hydrogen cation from the guard cells. Due to presence of carbon dioxide, a rapid acidification of cytoplasm takes place leading to stomatal closure. Milbarrow (1974) has described the formation of these chemicals in the chloroplast. It moves to the stomata, where it is responsible for checking the intake of Potassium ion or induces loss of potassium ion from the guard cells. Antitranspirants are of two types: metabolic inhibitors and film-forming antitranspirants. Metabolic inhibitors reduce the stomatal opening and increase the leaf resistance to water vapour diffusion without affecting carbon dioxide uptake. Examples include phenylmercury acetate, abscisic acid (ABA), and aspirin. Film-forming antitranspirants form a colorless film on the leaf surface that allows diffusion of gases but not of water vapour.

The religious innovators Muhammad Abduh and Jamal al- Din al-Afghani were early writers of the newspaper. Upon the death of Beshara Takla, Daud Barakat, a Lebanese journalist, was named editor of the daily in 1901. On 24 May 1960, the paper was nationalized when President Gamal Abdel Nasser passed a law eliminating the ownership of private newspapers. The circulation of the paper was between 45,000 and 50,000 copies in 1937 whereas it was 90,000 copies in 1947. In 1976 the paper had a circulation of 520,000 copies, making it the second most read daily in Egypt after Al Akhbar. Al Ahram's circulation in 2000 was 1.2 million copies. Profile and editions Al-Ahram daily is the flagship of what is now the Al-Ahram publishing house, the largest in Egypt.Islam, 2002, p. 277. Al-Ahram's headquarters is in Boulaq, Cairo. Its content was controlled by the Egyptian Ministry of Information. The pan-Arab Arabic-language edition of the paper, called Al Ahram Al Arabiya, is destined for readers in the Arab World and the Egyptian expatriates in Arab countries. It is published daily in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE and distributed in Egypt and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Arabic weekly, Al Ahram Al Arabi, which was launched in 1997 is another publication of the publishing house. An international Arabic-language edition called Al Ahram al Duwali has been published daily in London since 1984. It is printed in both London and Paris and is distributed throughout Europe, USA, Canada and Egypt. Two foreign-language weekly versions are also produced: the English Al-Ahram Weekly (founded in 1991) and the French Al-Ahram Hebdo. Al- Ahram produces a continually updated news website in the English language at English.Ahram.org.eg, called Ahram Online. It also has an Arabic news website which was the 20th mostly visited website for 2010 in the MENA region. It was named as the most popular news portal in the Arab world in the period from 31 August 2011 to 31 August 2012 by Forbes Middle East. Ownership and government influence Al-Ahram is owned by the Al-Ahram Foundation which is managed by the Egyptian government's \\"Supreme Council of Press\\". Al-Ahram is one of the largest circulating newspapers in the world. Long-term editor of the daily Mohammad Hassanein Haykal was the confidant of Nasser and also, the semi-official voice of the Egyptian government when he was in office. The Egyptian government owns a controlling share of the stocks of the paper and appoints the editors. As appointees of the state, little censorship is exercised over them; it is understood that they are loyal to the state. Under President Hosni Mubarak, Al-Ahram largely ignored, and trivialised the opposition parties to Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party, and did not publish much direct criticism of the government. The Anti-Defamation League, in a review of Arab newspapers in 2005, stated that Al-Ahram \\"is given substantial leeway\\" by the government so long as they avoid \\"certain 'taboos'.\\"Arab Media Review: Index of Arab Newspapers Anti-Defamation League, 14 February 2005 Reporters Without Borders, in their 2005 report on press freedom in Egypt, reported that editorials in many newspapers, including Al- Ahram, had become increasingly critical of the National Democratic Party's control of the government, and the corruption of the Mubarak regime.Egypt ‚Äì 2005 annual report , Reporters Without Borders, January 2005 In an interview with Reporters Without Borders, Abdel Halim Qandil, editor of the weekly magazine Al-Arabi, said that the government interfered with independent operation of Al-Ahram by controlling the printing presses and appointing the editors. Al-Ahram generated controversy in September 2010 when an Egyptian blogger, Wael Khalil, revealed that the newspaper had altered a photo of Middle East leaders walking with United States President Barack Obama so that instead of Obama leading the group, Egyptian President Mubarak was placed in the front when he was actually walking in the rearmost position. Osama Saraya, Al-Ahram's editor-in-chief, defended the altered photo, stating that it was meant to underscore Egypt's leading role in the peace process: \\"The expressionist photo is... a brief, live and true expression of the prominent stance of President Mubarak in the Palestinian issue, his unique role in leading it before Washington or any other.\\" Notable writers and editors Mohamed Hassanein Heikal was the long-term editor-in-chief of Al Ahram. He served in the post between August 1957 and 1974. Ali Amin served as editor-in- chief between 1974 and 1976. From 1978 to July 2006 Ibrahim Nafie was the editor-in-chief of Al Ahram. He also served as the chairman of the daily until 2005. Nafie was replaced by Osama Saraya as editor-in-chief in July 2005. In August 2012, Abdel Nasser Salama was appointed editor-in-chief of the paper by the Egyptian Shura Council. in May 2017 Alaa Thabet became the editor-in-chief of the paper.

The first Terra, Tara Markov, is an antiheroine eventually revealed to actually be a supervillainess working as a double-agent created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez, and debuted in New Teen Titans (vol. 1) #26 (December 1982). The second Terra, a doppelg√§nger of Tara Markov, debuted in New Titans #79 (September 1991) and was created by Marv Wolfman and Tom Grummett. The third Terra, Atlee, debuted in Supergirl #12 (January 2007) and was created by Jimmy Palmiotti, Justin Gray, and Amanda Conner. Publication history The character was created with an intended finite life span. Co-creator P√©rez stated that he and Marv Wolfman knew, \\"from the very start, that this girl was going to be a traitor and that we were going to kill this character off.\\" When creating the look of the character, P√©rez noted that: A new Terra appeared in Supergirl #12 while a Terra limited series was being developed, written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, with illustrations by Amanda Conner. Gray commented about the series, \\"Terra as a character has never had a definitive origin. That includes Terra 1 and 2. This mini will address that fact in some surprising ways and open the door to a new corner of the DCU. Aside from that the emphasis will be on heroism, true blue hero stuff.\\" Palmiotti later stated, \\"Terra is an enigma for obvious reasons. Every hero in the DCU is in the dark about who she is and why she‚Äôs doing what she‚Äôs doing, which is running around the planet saving and helping people. We‚Äôve been working with Terra for months and months trying to find and develop what‚Äôs special about her. In the end, it was a very simple angle, make Terra a superhero with plenty of emphasis on heroism. Everything she does is to help other people and in the service of life.\\" The 4-issue miniseries was temporarily shelved for a number of reasons, until its biweekly publication spanning November and December 2008. The new Terra previously appeared in Teen Titans #52-54 as part of \\"The Titans of Tomorrow...Today!\\" storyline and in the first issue of the Terror Titans limited series. Following this, she briefly appeared in Teen Titans #69 in the climax of the recruitment drive storyline, and became a supporting character in the ongoing Power Girl series. Tara Markov Fictional character biography TPB, featuring Tara Markov. Art by George P√©rez.180pxthumbleft Tara Markov, half-sister of Brion Markov (Geo-Force), was the illegitimate daughter of the King of Markovia. While in Markovia, she came under the care of a Dr. Helga Jace and, through her experiments, Terra obtained Earth manipulation powers‚Äîspecifically, the ability to control all forms of earthen matter. After obtaining these powers, her father requested that she leave Markovia for the United States, to prevent the scandal of the king having an illegitimate daughter from becoming public. Unlike her more heroic brother, Geo-Force, Terra had deep-rooted psychological issues including malignant narcissism, believing that, with their powers, they should rule Earth rather than help the weaker masses. As a result of this belief, Terra became a hitwoman, doing dirty work for others. A notable client was Deathstroke the Terminator, whom she met when she was fifteen and had a relationship with. She joined the Teen Titans, fooling them by staging a battle against Deathstroke. She then operated as a spy for Deathstroke, eventually giving him the information he needed to kidnap the Titans, with no regrets. Eventually, the captured Titans were held in a stronghold of Deathstroke's contractors, the H.I.V.E.; Nightwing and Deathstroke's son, Joseph Wilson (Jericho), raided the complex to rescue them, but were captured. When presented to Deathstroke and the organization in general, Jericho possessed his father and freed the Titans, who then attacked the H.I.V.E. Not knowing of Jericho's powers, Terra believed Deathstroke to have turned against her. In retaliation, she went berserk. When the misunderstanding was cleared, she was still murderously furious at Deathstroke for going \\"soft\\" with love for his son. Changeling (better known as Beast Boy), in an attempt to stop her rampage, shape-shifted into a small fly, then flew into her eye as a way to distract her. This finally pushed her over the edge as she pulled the whole H.I.V.E. complex down upon herself while trying to kill the Titans. Despite the discovery of her true intentions of joining them, a statue of her was placed in the memorial in Titans Tower. Her true activities were never made public, with her brother simply being told that she had died in battle. Subsequently, Batman eventually revealed the truth to him in an issue of Batman and the Outsiders, prompting Brion to change his costume to green and gold, as he considered the original brown and orange too similar to the outfit worn by his sister. In DCU: Last Will and Testament, Deathstroke takes credit for Terra's insanity by claiming he gave her the same serum he used on Cassandra Cain and his daughter, Rose Wilson, telling Geo-Force that \\"the problem with Terra was that we waited too long. By then the psychosis was so bad, she tried to kill us all.\\" This contradicts his earlier account of her lifelong insanity in the Titans stories following \\"The Judas Contract,\\" although it is possible that Terra had mental issues from the start and that Deathstroke's serum served to exacerbate them, to the point where Terra had her psychotic break that resulted in her death. The 2008 Terra miniseries had intended to explain that Terra was driven insane by an element called \\"quixium\\" harvested from Strata, which had been used by Markovian scientists to grant her earth-based superpowers. With a year-long delay in the publication of the Terra miniseries and the interim release of DCU: Last Will and Testament, this plot point was dropped completely. According to Justin Gray, \\"Terra 1 stays as she is in LW&T.; The brain damage was part of the initial story (before LW&T;) that connected all three Terras and Geo-Force to Strata, the book needed to be changed to reflect LW&T;, the double ship made changes to issue #2 impossible. It happens and we all did what we could to make it work.\\" Blackest Night In the first issue of Blackest Night: Titans, Terra's corpse is reanimated as a Black Lantern, seducing Beast Boy using an illusion cast by Lilith to mask her decayed appearance.Blackest Night: Titans #1 (August 2009) During the battle of the Black Lantern Titans, they were overwhelmed. Hawk (Holly Granger) plunges her hand into Dawn's chest. Dawn suddenly radiates a white energy that completely destroys Holly's body and ring. Dawn then turns the light on the other Black Lanterns, destroying all but Hank Hall, Tempest, and Terra, who quickly retreat.Blackest Night: Titans #3 (October 2009) Terra then travels to the Outsiders' base to see her brother. She claims to have broken free of whatever force was controlling her as a Black Lantern, and begs Geo-Force and the other Outsiders to kill her.Outsiders (vol. 4) #24 (January 2010) However, this was later revealed to be a ruse, a way of getting Geo-Force to display the strongest emotions possible. After a mostly one-sided battle, Terra's body is turned to stone by Geo-Force, and her ring is destroyed by Halo.Outsiders (vol. 4) #25 (February 2010) The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Terra/Tara is re-established as a blonde earth-powered heroine who is part of Caitlin Fairchild's team The Ravagers. The team also includes Beast Boy, Thunder and Lightning and a new character Ridge.Teen Titans Annual #1 The Ravagers are a group of super-powered teens who have escaped the plans of Harvest in The Culling. The team was formed after the Teen Titans and the Legionnaires stuck in the present day were abducted by Harvest, and then later stopped the villain and escaped.The Ravagers #1 Not surprisingly in the series Terra and Beast Boy develop a strong bond with each other which started in a place named The Colony where super-powered teenagers are deprived of their origins and family and kept as prisoners by a creature named Harvest where they suffer tortures, experiments and fight each other in order to remain only the strongest teens to be used by Harvest as a team to serve his purposes. In this place, Terra defends Beast Boy from being attacked by other super-powered prisoners as he returns the favour later when Terra was in danger, saving her.The Ravagers #0 Once free of the Colony, Terra and Beast Boy separated from the rest of their fellow Ravagers, hiding together in a cave. Later Beast Boy started having nightmares with the remaining Ravagers all covered with blood. It was later revealed that the one causing his nightmares was Brother Blood as he was targeting the one who could be used as a key to help his master gain access to The Red. Due to his connection with The Red, Beast Boy was the only one who could sense the evil intents of Brother Blood and therefore the key Blood was looking for. After sensing his presence, Terra was convinced by Gar to help the remaining Ravagers who were captured by Blood to be used as a sacrifice in his ritual and they eventually manage to stop and defeat Blood.The Ravagers #3-#4 After those events, Fairchild led the team to a place in Los Angeles. There the team is confronted by Superboy and Niles Caulder. Caulder is introduced as a long time associate of Fairchild. Later Fairchild and Caulder introduce the team to a deep underground science & engineering facility, which provides headquarters and combat training for the team in their campaign against the organization of N.O.W.H.E.R.E. Meanwhile, Harvest sent Rose Wilson and Warblade to recapture them.The Ravagers #5-6 As the series progresses, Terra and Beast Boy begin developing romantic feelings for each other. Later Terra reveals her feelings for Gar by teasing him: \\"Why in the world haven't you tried to kiss me yet?\\" After they do kiss, they become a couple.The Ravagers #10 When Rose and Warblade have difficulties in capturing the Ravagers,The Ravagers #8 Harvest makes a deal with Deathstroke to hunt down the Ravagers and attack each one using a special weapon called the Abeo Blade. Succeeding in invading Caulder's place, Deathstroke manages to \\"kill\\" Ridge (in his human form - a child), Caulder himself, Thunder and Lightning using the weapon and also cuts Warblade's head off. As Deathstroke chooses an already injured Beast Boy as his next victim, a desperate Terra tries to stop him in fear of losing Gar. But her attempt falls short as she is hit and burned by Deathstroke's Abeo Blade to which a horrified Garfield sees right before his eyes. After losing Terra pure rage takes command of Beast Boy as he tried to avenge her but with no success. After the battle with Beast Boy, Deathstroke proceeds and hits Rose and then Fairchild with the Abeo Blade finishing his job. Later it is revealed that the Abeo Blade was not a killing weapon and instead of a teleportation device, sending Rose and the Ravagers except Beast Boy back to the Colony once again. As part of the deal, Harvest gives Rose and Terra to Deathstroke.The Ravagers #12 DC Rebirth Tara made her return in Deathstroke as a member of the new team Defiance.Deathstroke (vol.4) #21 Tara Markov doppelg√§nger Terra visiting her grave in Team Titans #6. Cover art by Phil Jimenez. Terra was introduced as a young girl from the early 21st century who had been exposed to a DNA virus designed to transform her into a genetic doppelg√§nger of the original Terra. As part of the Team Titans, Terra went back in time to the year 1992 to stop the birth of Teen Titan Donna Troy's firstborn son, who would grow up to be the tyrannical Lord Chaos. Terra shared a mutual attraction to the Teen Titan Changeling. Unfortunately, despite their attraction, Changeling was openly hostile toward Terra II due to his own emotional scars from being used by the original Terra. The final issues of Team Titans revealed that the group's mysterious \\"leader\\" was Hank Hall, former Titan Hawk, who became the renegade time-traveling villain Monarch. His attempts to erase the universe from existence as part of Hal Jordan's plan to remake the universe during \\"Zero Hour\\" resulted in the erasing of the future that gave birth to the Team Titans. Only Terra and Mirage survived due to the aid of the Time Trapper. After the events of \\"Zero Hour,\\" Terra and Mirage joined the main Teen Titans team. Once there, they were told that they, along with fellow time traveler Deathwing (an evil version of Dick Grayson from the Lord Chaos future timeline), were really from the present day. The Time Trapper had whisked them away from the present to place them within Monarch's army of Titans in order to keep track of Monarch's schemes. After New Titans was canceled, Terra remained in limbo until the 1998 revival of the Teen Titans. In the 1999 Titans Secret Files special, Terra visits Geo-Force and undergoes genetic tests to determine her identity. When she expresses her fears that she is the original Terra, Geo-Force (who discovers that the test results confirm only what was previously known, that she was a genetic match for his sister) informs her that she is not his sister and destroys the test results. Later, under circumstances which have yet to be explained, Terra also becomes affiliated with the Outsiders.Day of Judgment #3-4 In the \\"Titans Tomorrow\\" storyline, the Titans glimpse a grim possible future, and Terra (in a costume modeled closely after her original) is a member of the Titans East, a more benign rival group that opposes the fascist future versions of the current Teen Titans. This future's version of Beast Boy, calling himself Animal Man, still bears a grudge against Terra and wants nothing to do with her. Terra is one of the many Titans who answer the summon to help Conner Kent defeat Superboy-Prime in Infinite Crisis #4, working with Sand to hit Prime with a mass of earth in an attempt to stop him.Infinite Criiss #4 52 Terra is a member of the Teen Titans group, led by Beast Boy, who fights Black Adam during the World War III storyline. In their second encounter with the crazed Marvel, she catches Black Adam off guard by crushing him between two massive boulders. Although this maneuver hurts Adam, it fails to disable him, and in a fit of anger he punches through her chest, killing her instantly. Instead of pursuing Black Adam, the Titans stay behind to bury their fallen comrade.World War III #3 (June 2007) Origin The mystery of the second Terra's origins was addressed in the 2008 Terra miniseries. She had been born in an underground world called Strata and sent away by its members to establish relations with the surface world. She allowed the Stratans to surgically alter her to resemble the original Terra, believing surface- dwellers would more easily accept her if she reminded them of one of their own. They used an element called \\"quixium\\" to grant her earth-based powers similar to that of her predecessor, a process that, when combined with the original Terra's DNA, had the unfortunate side-effect of total memory loss.Terra #4 Atlee Fictional character biography Promotional cover artwork for Terra#1, by Amanda Conner, featuring the new Terra, known as Atlee. A new Terra named Atlee appears in Supergirl #12 (January 2007), sporting a new outfit and black hair. She emerges near a party Supergirl is attending, fighting a creature from a civilization under the Earth's surface. While Supergirl expresses disdain for the superhero activities which interfere with her personal life, Terra counters by saying that being a superhero is simply the right thing to do; she does not comprehend Supergirl's complaints. Together they defeat the monster by collapsing the ground under it. Terra then departs. The Terra miniseries revealed that she is a member of an alien race called Stratans who live below the Earth's surface in a massive cave called Strata which is actually the empty spacesuit of a long dead cosmic extraterrestrial, and possesses a rare mutation granted by a unique ore called \\"quixium\\" that grants her the earth powers she wields.Terra #1-3 (2008‚Äì2009) =Titans of Tomorrow...Today!= Atlee appears as a future version of herself in Teen Titans #52-54 as part of the \\"Titans of Tomorrow...Today!\\" storyline =Terror Titans= During the Final Crisis crossover, a group of teen supervillains calling themselves the Terror Titans begin abducting teenaged metahumans to use as competitors in the Dark Side Club, an underground arena where the young heroes are brainwashed and forced to fight to the death for spectators and wealthy patrons. After learning of the abductions, Terra goes on the run, eventually meeting up with fellow teen superheroes Aquagirl, Molecule, Offspring, Zachary Zatara, and the Star- Spangled Kid. While deciding on a course of action, the teens are ambushed by the Terror Titans, who proceed to overpower and capture them, killing Molecule in the process. Atlee and the others are taken to the Dark Side Club and subjected to the Anti-Life Equation, which causes them to become slaves to Darkseid and his cadre of followers. After winning several matches in the tournament, Terra is made a member of the Clock King's Martyr Militia, a team of brainwashed superhumans he plans to use on an attack in Los Angeles. Atlee and the others are ultimately freed from the Anti-Life Equation when Miss Martian, Rose Wilson, and Static lead a rebellion against the Terror Titans and capture the various members of the Dark Side Club.Terror Titans #1-6 (2008‚Äì2009) In the aftermath of the successful rebellion, Atlee accompanies her rescuers and fellow survivors to Titans Tower in San Francisco, hoping to take some time to recuperate. While resting, Atlee is offered a spot on the Teen Titans by Wonder Girl, which she politely declines, saying that she wishes to distance herself from the tragedy surrounding the membership of the previous two bearers of the Terra identity.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #69 (2009) =Power Girl sidekick= Rested from her stay with the Titans, Atlee returns to be the sidekick of Power Girl, successfully helping her save Manhattan from the Ultra-Humanite.Power Girl #1-3 (2009) After that, she elects Manhattan as her base of operation, to benefit from the constant mentoring of Power Girl both in establishing and maintaining a human identity, and in her superhero persona.Power Girl #4 (2009) She takes on an Australian accent in her civilian identity, finding the half-truth of her being from \\"down under\\" quite humorous. She and Power Girl begin a close friendship, going to movies and even shopping together at an IKEA-esque Scandinavian furniture store. Atlee also decides to drop her Australian accent, instead claiming that her new cover identity is that of a spy, something Power Girl finds quite humorous.Power Girl #6 (2009) Terra helps Power Girl during her battle with Satanna, and later ends up discussing the possibility of joining the Justice Society or the Teen Titans. Power Girl notices that Atlee's demeanor has changed, and begins to suspect that something is wrong. It is eventually revealed that Atlee had been kidnapped by Ultra-Humanite and had her brain removed in order for him to place his brain in her body, due to Power Girl crippling his body in a former fight. Eventually, Power Girl is able to retrieve Atlee, now trapped in the crippled simian body of the Ultra- Humanite, and bring her back to Strata. There, Atlee is given her body back and the Ultra-Humanite is turned into the human Gerard Shugel. In this occasion, Atlee expresses no desire to stay in Strata, asking Power Girl to bring her back to the surface world, to which she has grown a liking, as soon as possible.Power Girl #11 (2010) In Wonder Woman #600, Atlee appears alongside fellow teen heroines Batgirl and Supergirl as part of an all-female team designed to repel a faux-alien invasion.Wonder Woman's all-female superteam After the battle is over, Atlee proclaims that she thinks she could take Wonder Woman in a fight, a notion that Stargirl scoffs at. =The New 52= Atlee debuted in the New 52 continuity in Starfire #3.Starfire #3 (October 2015) She has also appeared in Harley Quinn's Rebirth series befriending Harley and helping her and Power Girl take down an alien overlord. Mostly she and Harley watched as Power Girl reluctantly agreed to go on a date with him, got mad, and pummeled him as she has in similar situations in the past. They were just deciding what to do with him, as he had been previously buried in a cocoon, when he wandered off and got hit by a truck. Atlee and Harley then decided to hit the town with a few of Harley's friends. Powers and personality Despite her horrific ordeal at the hands of the Dark Side Club and her earlier appearances as a serious, keeps-to-herself, quiet and polite young woman, Atlee's personality is on the opposite end of the spectrum from the original Tara. As Tara mostly hid a brooding, dark personality, Atlee's true self seems to be the one of a cheery, peppy, and nonsensical adolescent, completely innocent about surface life, and hailing from a society who apparently banished malice and human greed from their lifestyles. As a result, she takes an early veneration for Power Girl, seldom leaving her side.Terra #1-4 (2009) She also shows a deep craving for human \\"pop culture,\\" a permanent fixture of the 2009 Power Girl series being Atlee comically commenting and trying to emulate fictional characters from various movies. Atlee's powers are currently limitless, while she limits herself to \\"harmless\\" feats such as growing large formations of rock with the slowness needed to avoid a geological hazard, and using floating rocks as projectiles and to levitate around, Gerard Shugel, the Ultra-Humanite, while residing in her body, was able to shift nearby tectonic plates with ease or cause volcanoes to erupt at his will. He surmises that Atlee has always had this amazing amount of power, but willingly chose to limit herself in fear of the damage she could cause. Other versions Earth-33 On Earth-33, a world of magicians, Terra is an earth mage, who appears to be one with the soil. Future Terra The future Terra, of the Teen Titans, is re-imagined as a resistance member, fighting for the freedom of hundreds of alien worlds. She partners with Nightrider until they are folded into a larger resistance cell.Team Titans Annual #2 (1994) Earth One In Teen Titans: Earth One, the first Terra re-introduced as a founding member of the Titans. Here she a troubled, short-tempered girl with issues with her alcoholic mother with the ability to control the earth around her, and in a relationship with Cyborg.Teen Titans: Earth One Vol. 1 Flashpoint In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Terra joined the Amazons' Furies, and it was through her that New Themyscira was saved from destruction when Aquaman flooded Western Europe.Flashpoint: Emperor Aquaman #1 (June 2011) Later, Terra was targeted by Siren and Ocean Master, but their plans were foiled when Hippolyta's sister Penthesileia showed up.Flashpoint: Emperor Aquaman #2 (July 2011) Terra joined them because her half-brother Geo-Force, was used by Aquaman to sink Western Europe.Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies #2 (July 2011) Dark Multiverse In Dark Multiverse: The Judas Contract, Dick Grayson unwittingly makes things worse when he talks with Terra about his plans to retire as Robin, explaining that he feels it is important to move on from being a student to find your own way in the world. Terra's twisted psyche causes her to take that idea to its worst extreme as she turns on Slade and orders Wintergreen to subject her to the same drugs that transformed Slade into his current state, with her previously-enhanced physiology allowing her to come through the process far more easily than Slade did. With her enhanced powers, Terra renames herself 'Gaia' and destroys Titans Tower by throwing it into the atmosphere along with Starfire, Raven, Cyborg and Donna, and subsequently attacks Dick in his rooms. Dick is briefly rescued by Wally, and the two call Superman for help, but Gaia's heightened powers allow her to even defeat Superman by drawing all of Earth's kryptonite to her, subsequently triggering massive earthquakes just to make it clear to the few survivors of this attack that she is now in control of Earth. In other media Television =Teen Titans= Teen Titans animated series. *Voiced by Ashley Johnson. Like many characters in the series, Terra's backstory and appearance were modified for the cartoon series. The character was portrayed as a more sympathetic and tragic heroine rather than an irredeemable psychopathic villainess. Terra is a teenage girl with long, straight, blonde hair and superpowers similar to those of her comics counterpart. Terra can manipulate the ground, rocks, and earth-like material around her. But unlike her comic book counterpart, Terra has little control over her powers, which is a source of shame for her, and is ultimately what leads her to betray the Teen Titans. Introduced during Season 2 of the series, Terra first encounters the Teen Titans while being chased by a giant scorpion monster. After defeating the monster, she leaves with the Titans, among whom Beast Boy immediately develops a crush on her. Terra and Beast Boy spend time together as friends after their first meeting, with Terra confiding to Beast Boy her problems controlling her powers, which he agrees to keep a secret. Later, during an encounter with Slade, the villain tells Terra that he knows everything about her, including her lack of control over her powers and all of the disasters that she has caused as a result, and that this is the real reason why she is constantly on the move. Slade offers to train her in exchange for her servitude, which Terra refuses, although Slade would plant seeds of doubt regarding whether or not Beast Boy would keep his word. When Robin asks Terra to be a Teen Titan, she happily accepts, but runs away after Robin tells her that she will need help controlling her powers, prompting her to believe that Beast Boy had broken his promise. In reality, Robin had merely figured it out on his own. Terra flees the Titans Tower and ultimately agrees to work for Slade in exchange for training on how to master her abilities. After some time secretly training under Slade, she returns to the Titans Tower as a double agent. At this point, Beast Boy confesses to Terra his infatuation with her, and the two go out on their first official romantic date. While they are away, the Titans Tower is attacked by an army of Slade's robots that were able to infiltrate because of information Terra provided to Slade. When Terra confesses to Beast Boy what she had done, Beast Boy rejects her. Now given a new costume designed to \\"control\\" her powers, Terra begins to serve as Slade's apprentice and vows to destroy the Titans. She defeats the Titans one by one and attempts to crush them in an avalanche. After successfully taking over Jump City, Terra reminisces the good times she once had with the Titans, and regrets what she has done. When it becomes apparent that Terra has failed to kill the Titans, Terra's suit is revealed to be a fail-safe, which allows Slade to control her. Slade forces her to attack Beast Boy, nearly killing him. Terra is able to overcome her costume, and triggers a volcanic eruption that kills Slade and threatens to kill the Titans as well. In the end, Terra ultimately incapacitates herself to save her friends and the city by turning back the full force of the volcanic eruption, and is transformed into a solid stone statue in the process. Later, after returning home from defeating the Brotherhood of Evil, Beast Boy is shocked to find a girl that looks like Terra at a local school, apparently unharmed. While she claims to have no recollection of her previous life, it is revealed that the statue Terra turned into had vanished. After failing to convince the girl to return, she ultimately tells Beast Boy to let go of the past. Teen Titans Go!. =Teen Titans Go!= *Voiced by Ashley Johnson again, Terra is more like her comic book counterpart in being a bona-fide villainess. In her debut appearance \\"Terra-ized\\", she attempts to use Beast Boy in order to steal the Teen Titans' files and defense schematics. Though most of the Titans are oblivious to her intentions, she is stopped by Raven and is sent into another dimension. Terra later appears in the episode \\"Be Mine\\". Raven tells Cyborg that Terra is in the trash hole and not to tell Beast Boy but does. Beast Boy rescues Terra with a rope and asks her to be his Valentine. She agrees telling Beast Boy she has a special gift for the Valentine's dance. Beast Boy tells everybody. Raven uses her powers to show that Terra plans to kill the Titans. At the dance, Beast Boy played a special love song for her, 'Fade Away', a song describing their never ending love which she feels touched. Raven then threw her back into a trash hole, Beast Boy in tow. The later episode \\"Rocks and Water\\" revealed the two dated after these events, but Terra broke up with Beast Boy after continuously singing the song again and again, irritating her. The episode reveals she is dating Aqualad: this breaks Beast Boy's heart due to still having feelings for her; angers Raven; and befuddles Robin, Starfire and Cyborg as they think the two have nothing in common. In order to make them jealous, Beast Boy and Raven pretend to be in a relationship and go on a double date with Terra and Aqualad, and try to break the two up by sabotaging the date and making the two be at odds. Eventually they find out about the deception, but their differences have become obvious: the only thing they have in common is a mutual dislike of the Teen Titans. Beast Boy and Raven defeat the two before they can attack and send them both into the trash hole. Terra returns in \\"Operation Dude Rescue\\" when Raven, Starfire, Jinx, and Ravager recruit her to help them save a captive Robin, Cyborg, and Beast Boy from the Brain. While agreeing to working together with the other girls, Terra schemes to betray them all and get revenge on Raven, seizing her chance to aid the Brain in imprisoning all of them, herself included. However, Raven expresses a desire to unite the team as friends, even telling Terra that she's always found her to be cool, earning Terra's semi-friendship. Terra helps Raven and the rest take down the Brain, but they all leave the guys behind when they make it seem like they're not wanted, so all the girls have a night out with each other instead. =Young Justice: Outsiders= *Voiced by Tara Strong, this Terra has a Markovian accent as opposed to American. She was one of the many teenagers captured by a meta-human trafficking ring, two years before the season at age thirteen. Unlike her other incarnations, she is the Princess of Markovia and has two fraternal twin brothers, Prince Brion/Geo-Force and Crown Prince Gregor who was crowned king after his parents, King Viktor Markov and Queen Ilona DeLamb, sudden assassination at the sword of a metahuman possessing superhuman speed. Her inherent earth-controlling abilities had surfaced when her meta-gene was activated at the behest of her power-mad maternal uncle, Baron Fredrick DeLamb. These geokinetic powers seem to run in her family's bloodline as royal physician Dr. Jace had called it the \\"Geo- Force\\". During the time she was missing, she had become a member of the League of Shadows under Deathstroke and conducted assassination work for them until the titular Outsiders became a potential threat to Deathstroke and his allies in the Light. In \\"True Heroes\\", Terra allows herself to be \\"rescued\\" by the Outsiders, so she can secretly infiltrate them and learn their weaknesses for her master Deathstroke. She and the other three members later joined the Team. It is revealed that her metagene was activated by Dr. Helga Jace. Though having no lines in \\"Influence\\" \\"Leverage\\" or \\"Illusion of Control\\", Terra had used her phone to record Dr. Jace's assurance to help Victor as payment for the kindness Black Lightning and the others have shown her, to Deathstroke. She now has a super suit that are the same colors as her jacket; light brown with orange stripes. Artemis came to notice that she does not talk much. In a white stealth suit, she went on a covert mission with Tigress, Halo and her elder brother Geo-Force to stop more meta-human trafficking in Russia, which was known for being a rival country with Markovia. She utilized her earth- related abilities to mentally levitate and hurl several boulders at Black Manta, Mallah and Captain Boomerang. In this adaptation of Terra, her affiliation with the Shadows was always known by Tigress and Batman, and she made the decision to remain with the Team. Unlike her previous animated appearances, she decides to be a hero. Films *Terra appears in the mid- credits of the animated film Justice League vs. Teen Titans. *Terra appears in Teen Titans: The Judas Contract, voiced by Christina Ricci. In this version, her origins started as a child shortly after her powers emerged. Seeing her as a witch, the entire town turned against her because of her powers, and she would've been killed had it not been for Deathstroke's intervention. She poses as the new Titans member while secretly working as a double-agent for Slade (whom, just like in the DC comics, she also has romantic feelings towards). She acts cold and distant toward the Titans despite their welcoming attitude, but warms up to them over time and even kisses Beast Boy. The day after her one-year anniversary party with the Titans, she and Slade capture all of them (minus Nightwing) and bring them to Brother Blood. However, due to Nightwing's absence, Slade hands Terra over to fill in his spot for the machine that Brother Blood uses to absorb the Titans' powers. When she is saved by Nightwing and awakens, she is enraged that Slade had played her all along and (apparently) kills him. Too ashamed to face her former friends/allies after betraying them, she chooses to bring down the whole fortress on herself. Beast Boy digs her up, and she dies in his arms. *Both the Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go! versions of Terra have non-speaking cameos in Teen Titans Go! Vs. Teen Titans. Video games *Terra is an unlockable playable character in Teen Titans, voiced again by Ashley Johnson. She is unlocked for the \\"Master of Games\\" multiplayer mode after the player completes the \\"Dock Duel\\" level. *Terra is a playable character via downloadable content in LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham in the Heroines and Villainesses Pack, alongside Batwoman, Killer Frost, Mera, Power Girl, Plastique, The Spoiler, Raven, Starfire, and Vixen. In the game, her own unique Earth-based abilities enable her to fly over a rock board (a trait which was used in the comics), shoot rock beams, break through cracked LEGO walls, dig and sink into swamp pools. *The Teen Titans Go! incarnation of Terra is also present in Lego Dimensions, with Ashley Johnson reprising her role once again. The player assists her in a sidequest to retrieve a flash drive in Titans Tower, but battles her after discovering that the flash drive contains secret files of the Titans. After her defeat, she is crushed by falling trash from the ceiling and surrenders. *In Injustice 2, Tara Markov is mentioned in the Multiverse scenario \\"Tremor\\" in which Deathstroke uses her to terraform the Earth causing sudden Earthquakes on every continent which is represented in battle by the \\"Terraforming\\" active modifier which causes earthquakes that briefly stun the combatants on the ground during a match. *In the latest DC Universe Online episode, Terra makes an appearance as a boss character. *Terra appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains. While she does not have any speaking lines, her vocal effects were provided by Laura Bailey. Miscellaneous *Terra makes a few appearances in Teen Titans Go!, a comic book series set in the same universe as the Teen Titans animated series. She appeared in issue #11 (\\"Countdown\\"), #12 (\\"Magic & Misdirection\\") and #51 (\\"Metamorphosis\\"). Issue #51 is set after the series finale of the animated series. Terra's brother, Geo-Force, arrives at Titans Tower and relates Terra's origin: she was the princess of Markovia and, along with her brother, was experimented on by sinister interests within the royal court, which gave them both earth-based superpowers. Feeling exploited, Terra ran away, leading to the events of the animated series. At the end of the story, Geo-Force and Beast Boy consider visiting Terra at her school, but decide to leave her be, as she is the happiest she has ever been.

It was formed in the early 1970s, and disbanded in the early 1980s. The members of Column 88 undertook military training under the supervision of a former Royal Marine Commando, and also held regular gatherings attended by neo-nazis from all over Europe. The name is code: the eighth letter of the alphabet 'HH' represents the Nazi greeting 'Heil Hitler'. Journalist Martin Walker described Column 88 as a \\"shadow paramilitary Nazi group\\".Martin Walker, The National Front, Fontana, 1977, , p. 186 Formation A secret Nazi underground group, the origins of Column 88 have been given as early as 1945.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organisations: parties, groups and movements of the 20th century, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 181 Indeed, Gerry Gable has claimed that Colin Jordan was sworn in as a member of this secret society as a nineteen-year-old.Gerry Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', Luciano Cheles, Ronnie Ferguson, Michalina Ferguson, Neo-Fascism in Europe, Longman, 1991, p. 247 According to historian Richard Thurlow, Column 88 took their name from a group of Austrians who set up an underground group of this name in 1934 when the Austrian government banned the Nazi Party.Richard Thurlow, Fascism in Britain A History, 1918-1985, Basil Blackwell, 1987, p. 267 Open activity, however, did not start until 1970 when it took charge of elements of the National Socialist Group, a secret paramilitary grouping associated with the British Movement. The founders of this more organised group had been followers of Colin Jordan who had become disillusioned with their former leader after he began to moderate his public utterances in the wake of the 1965 and 1968 Race Relations Acts.Thurlow, Fascism in Britain A History, 1918-1985, p. 277 One of their major critiques of Jordan was his decision two years earlier to disband the National Socialist Movement in order to establish the British Movement, an action which they interpreted as a retreat from Nazism. According to one report, \\"Column 88, was connected with the Gladio networks. These networks were set up after the Second World War, with the support of the US Central Intelligence Agency, by a number of powers, both within and outside NATO as anti-communist resistance bodies\\". Luciano Cheles (Editor). The Far Right in Western and Eastern Europe. Longman Publishing Group; 2nd edition, 1995. p.258. According to another report, Major Ian Souter Clarence, a former Special Forces Officer, \\"helped set up Column 88 in the 1960s as the British section of Gladio\\". Martin Durham. Women and Fascism. Taylor & Francis. 1998. p.63. Leadership The group's military commander was Major Ian Souter ClarenceGary Murray, Enemies of the State (Simon & Schuster Ltd) 1994 who had served in the Black Watch during the Second World War before becoming active as a supporter of Arnold Leese. Stories about him stockpiling weapons had been known to MI5 from as early as 1946.Graham Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black - Sir Oswald Mosley and the Resurrection of British Fascism After 1945, IB Tauris, 2007, p. 174 He organised a number of camps to provide combat training to Column 88 members. One such camp, held in November 1975 in conjunction with the League of St George, was reported in the well known UK anti-fascist Searchlight magazine where those in attendance included Brian Baldwin, a prison officer from Manchester, and Peter Marriner, the head of the British Movement in Birmingham.Ray Hill & Andrew Bell, The Other Face of Terror - Inside Europe's Neo-Nazi Network, Grafton Books, 1988, pp. 223-224 The overall leader however was Leslie Eric Lutz Vaughan, a veteran of the British National Party and its paramilitary wing Spearhead. Vaughan was, according to Ray Hill, close to Anthony Reed Herbert in a professional capacity (Herbert being a lawyer and Vaughan a private investigator) and the work Vaughan put Herbert's way ensured that Column 88 played a leading role in Herbert's British Democratic Party.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, p. 108-109 Indeed, following a World in Action report in 1981 detailing British Democratic Party attempts at gun-running Vaughan and Column 88 temporarily went into abeyance for fear of becoming implicated.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, p. 224 Other leading members included Joe Short, who had been involved in David Myatt's National Democratic Freedom Movement,Barberis, McHugh, Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish political organizations, p. 186 Graham Gillmore, a mercenary and NF memberGable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 254 and David Myatt.Goodrick-Clark, N.

Indeed, A.K. Chesterton, who had established the National Front, wrote in one of his final letters to John Tyndall expressing his concerns that NF members were becoming involved in Column 88.Thurlow, Fascism in Britain A History, 1918-1985, p. 258 In the late 1970s, the organisation allegedly carried out several bomb attacks on left-wing British organisations, including the Socialist Workers Party, the Anti-Nazi League and the left-wing Housmans bookshop, where the pacifist and anti-racist magazine Peace News was published.\\"Bomb Explodes At Peace News\\", Irish Times, July 5th 1978, pg. 7 Many suspected that this group were behind the arson attack that destroyed the Albany Empire in Deptford, south London in July 1978 during the Rock Against Racism campaign. Other bomb attacks that it was reported to have carried out included those against targets as diverse as the homes of Conservative Party members and transmission towers whilst the group also claimed a series of arson attacks on Jewish-owned businesses. Column 88 first came to public attention in 1975, when the regional British newspaper, the Western Daily Press, published accounts of Column 88 members training, in Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, with elements of the Territorial Army.Western Daily Press, 7/4/75, 29/4/75, 30/4/75 This led to a question being asked, by a Member of Parliament, in the House of Commons,Hansard, 29 April 1976 and to other reports in British newspapers, such as The Guardian.Geoffrey Harris, The Dark Side of Europe The Extreme Right Today, Edinburgh University Press, 1994, p. 123The Guardian, 19 April 1976 The British anti-fascist magazine, Searchlight, also published articles about Column 88 in May 1975, and May 1976. Infiltration of the Army Cadet Force was also organised by Column 88.Paul Wilkinson, The New Fascists, Pan Books, 1983, p. 122 Column 88 was also said to have been involved in the establishment of a number of other far- right groups, including the exclusive League of St. George and the National Party. National Party leader John Kingsley Read claimed that he received funds from Column 88 both for his own party and during his time as chairman of the National Front.Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 248 In 1983 Column 88 hit the headlines again when the press reported that Clarence had been \\"safe-housing\\" three German neo-Nazis terrorists Odfried Hepp, Ulrich Tillmann and Walter Kexel, who were wanted for bomb attacks on US Army bases in Germany.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, p. 175 References External links * The spy left out in the cold, on the site of the BBC *Incidents attributed to Column 88 by that START terrorism database Neo-Nazi organizations Anti-communism Espionage Neo-Nazi organisations in the United Kingdom 20th century in the United Kingdom 1970s establishments in the United Kingdom 1990s disestablishments in the United Kingdom Anti-communist organizations ","title":"Column 88"},{"id":"718534","text":"Goatman may refer to: *Goatman (Kentucky), also known as the Pope Lick Monster, a legendary creature of Louisville, Kentucky, United States *Goatman (Maryland), a legendary creature from Maryland, United States *Goatman (Texas), also known as the Lake Worth monster, a legendary creature from Lake Worth, Texas, United States *GoatMan: How I Took a Holiday from Being Human, a 2016 book by Thomas Thwaites *The Goat Man, Ches McCartney (died 1998), American traveler ","title":"Goatman"},{"id":"718536","text":"The Gulf Daily News (GDN) is an English-language local newspaper published in the Kingdom of Bahrain by Al Hilal Group.

The character was created by writer Judd Winick and artist Tom Raney, first appearing in Outsiders (vol. 3) #1 (August 2003) in the Modern Age of Comic Books. Choi is introduced as a young Asian American woman using her powers of superhuman strength, healing, and enhanced durability to make a living as a nightclub bouncer, who is reluctantly recruited by her superhero acquaintance Roy Harper to join his new crew of heroes, the Outsiders. In the course of their adventures, Grace comes to take pride in her work as a superhero, and discovers that she is descended from a tribe of Amazons, explaining her better-than-human abilities, and giving her a new role model in Wonder Woman. While working with the team, she enters into a relationship with her teammate Thunder, the daughter of superhero and Outsider-founding member Black Lightning. Outside of comics, Choi has made appearances in television shows and video games. The character is portrayed by Chantal Thuy in the live-action television series Black Lightning. However, this version of her is a metahuman instead of an Amazon and possesses the ability to shapeshift. Fictional character biography Origin Grace Choi is a tall Asian-American woman with metahuman strength who sports tattoos styled along Pacific First Nations lines on both of her arms and a circular sun design around her navel. Grace's history was explored in detail in the \\"Outsiders: Most Wanted\\" arc, in which it was revealed that she was one of the surviving victims of a prostitution ring that exploited abducted and runaway children as its \\"merchandise\\". Upon reaching puberty, Grace used her then- nascent metahuman powers to escape, and spent the next several years living independently, until her recruitment into the Outsiders. Though initially the source of Grace's powers was not revealed, when the team was captured by the Brain and Monsieur Mallah in Outsiders (vol. 3) #39, they noted that Grace has been enhanced more than \\"her kind\\" usually is. The Outsiders were confused by that remark, leading Mallah to laugh and comment: \\"You mean they don't know what you are?\\" Later, Grace's Amazon lineage was revealed. Joining the Outsiders In her first appearance in Outsiders (vol. 3) #1, she was the bouncer for the metahuman nightclub Chaney's in Metropolis; Arsenal recruited her for the newly formed Outsiders. She and Arsenal were old friends but she was not very keen on joining until he told her the Outsiders job would pay her three times more than her bouncer job. \\"One Year Later\\" Grace Choi remains a member of the Outsiders, and assisted in toppling the regime of Mali. She gets along quite well with the team's newest member, Captain Boomerang II, and the two have been involved in the somewhat questionable interrogation of some soldiers, involving torture. It has been revealed that Grace has been secretly involved in a relationship with Thunder (Anissa Pierce). After an unsuccessful mission in North Korea involving Checkmate, Nightwing hands over the Outsiders to Batman, who elects to decide on his own roster culminating in DC Comics' relaunch of the Batman and the Outsiders title. Grace features in the Amazons Attack limited series where during an attack on the United States by the Amazons, she encounters the Bana Amazons. One of its members tells her that she is actually part of their tribe, the explanation for earlier allusions by others to \\"her kind.\\"Amazons Attack #5 This did not entirely explain Grace's metahuman powers, however, as the Bana Amazons have only peak human level strength and conditioning while their Themyscirian Amazon cousins possess true metahuman strength. In the aftermath of the war, Batman assigns Wonder Woman and Grace to a cleanup mission which serves as an audition for his new Outsiders roster. Grace identifies herself as half-Amazonian and displays a deep knowledge of Bana-Mighdall history. Batman and Wonder Woman accept that she is a Bana, and it is confirmed when Grace successfully handles a bomb engineered so that only women with Bana DNA might control it.Outsiders - Five of a Kind: Wonder Woman/Grace Diana and Grace end their joint mission describing each other as cousins. Grace was briefly shown working alongside the Birds of Prey when they attempted to stop a group of villains from killing the Secret Six and taking Neron's \\"Get Out of Hell Free\\" card from them.Secret Six (vol. 2) #7 Pleased with her performance, Batman welcomes Grace as the final member of his Outsiders. Despite being angry that Thunder \\"washed out\\" during Batman's try-outs and has been excluded from the team, she accepts. She then invites Thunder back onto the team without Batman's permission. Following the apparent death of Bruce Wayne, the Outsiders fall into a trap set by Simon Hurt, and most of the team members are severely injured. The group is disbanded shortly thereafter, and is replaced by a new team of Outsiders. Some time later, Grace shows up in Wonder Woman #600 as a member of Wonder Woman's all-female team of heroes.Wonder Woman's all-female team from Wonder Woman #600 Many months after her departure from the Outsiders, Grace is shown in a live-in relationship with Anissa, with both women now in a state of semi-retirement following Anissa's recovery. When Black Lightning arrives at Grace and Anissa's apartment with his small band of fugitive heroes, Grace comes to his aid and helps fight off the attacking members of the Justice Society of America. In the ensuing battle, Grace renders Stargirl and Mister America unconscious, telling them not to threaten her \\"in-law\\". After the battle with the JSA, both Grace and Thunder agree to join up with Black Lightning's small team of Outsiders, who are tasked by Amanda Waller with travelling to Markovia and capturing Geo-Force and his rogue faction of the team.Outsiders vol. 4 #36. DC Comics. Following a massive battle in Markovia, both teams of Outsiders are disbanded by Batman, and the individual heroes return home.Outsiders vol. 4 #40. DC Comics.

In other media Television * Thunder can be seen texting Grace in the first Thunder and Lightning short on DC Nation Shorts. * Grace Choi appears in the Black Lightning TV series, portrayed by Chantal Thuy while her teenager form is portrayed by Stella Smith and her old man form is portrayed by Joseph Steven Yang. Grace met Anissa Pierce at a library, insisting she check out a favorite of hers, The Outsiders. She then promptly invited her to a cosplay party at the bar she worked at. At the party, the two danced together, before being interrupted by Anissa's then-girlfriend Chenoa. Trying to avoid a fight at her bar, Grace asked Chenoa to take their problems outside. Leaving the Ruby Red Lipstick Bar with Anissa, they were confronted by former patrons, angry at Grace and the bar. He knocked out Grace, but the whole group was quickly knocked out by Anissa. She soon woke up, with Anissa tending to a graze on her head. She reappears in the second season. It is revealed in the episode \\"Book of Secrets: Chapter Three: Pillar of Fire\\" that \\"Grace Choi\\" is an alias. Her real name is Shay Li Wylde, who was kidnapped and forced into prostitution at a young age before she was rescued by I.C.E.. She disappeared and resurfaced in Freeland as Choi. Furthermore, she was seen taking pills whenever her eyes started changing color and spots start to appear, which were later revealed to treat schizophrenia. She led a normal life until Anissa saw her eyes change color, which led to Grace leaving and disappearing. In the episode \\"The Book of the Apocalypse: Chapter One: The Alpha\\", Thunder told Peter Gambi about her encounter with an old man who had glowing eyes and a half-eaten horse in his apartment. This caused Gambi to theorize that Grace is a shapeshifter. Jennifer comments to Anissa that Grace will resurface eventually. In the episode \\"The Book of Occupation: Chapter One: Birth of the Blackbird,\\" Anissa and Gambi find security footage of Grace shapeshifting from a leopard. In \\"The Book of Occupation: Chapter Three: Agent Odell's Pipe-Dream\\", Grace reunites with Anissa where she reveals her shapeshifting abilities which she is working to control. Anissa accepts Grace's metahuman status as they rekindle their love relationship. In \\"The Book of Occupation: Chapter Four: Lynn's Ouroboros\\", Jefferson learns of Grace's abilities. In \\"The Book of Resistance: Chapter Two: Henderson's Opus,\\", Anissa has her father evacuate Grace with the other suspected metahumans. When an A.S.A. soldier follows Grace into a house, he is killed by her leopard form. Black Lightning catches up to her and Grace voices her knowledge of his identity due to the scents she maintains from her leopard form. In the season three finale, Grace and Thunder confront Gravedigger in the Pit. Gravedigger mind-controls Grace into attacking Thunder causing her to use her powers to knock Grace out. Following the Markovian invasion on Freeland, Lynn states that Grace is in a coma where she is unsure when she'll come out of it. She does state to Anissa that they should place her somewhere where she can get some full care. Video games * Grace Choi appears in DC Universe Online.

Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains. It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives.https://web.archive.org/web/20110710125157/http://www.digitdynam.com/command_control.html The latter require a dedicated remote controller. MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously. Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts). TMCC/Legacy \\"broadcasts\\" its signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features. DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts. While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control. This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly \\"narrowcast\\" to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions. In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains. TMCC permits operation of multiple trains on the same track without complex wiring, and also gives locomotives realistic digitized sounds. Its development was backed financially by rock and roller Neil Young as part of a partnership between Young and one- time Lionel owner Richard Kughn known as Liontech. Liontech, roughly headquartered on Young's northern California ranch, consisted of a loose confederation of technology developers whom Young had assembled to help develop individual components of the TrainMaster Command system. Chief among these contributors was Applied Design Laboratories of Grass Valley, California, headed by Atari 2600 co-patent holder Ron Milner. Young had been referred to Milner by his neighbor and friend, Nolan Bushnell, co-founder of Atari. Milner's team (consisting of numerous members, including Robert Johnson and Bryan Scott) developed the main elements of the Command system, including the innovation of using the Lionel steel tubular track system as a broadcast antenna for digital signals overlaying the electrical power being delivered through the track to locomotives, rolling stock and connected accessories. In larger layout practical application, the use of the track as an antenna has fallen somewhat short of success, however and a separate antenna wire stapled along the right-of-way has proven to solve the problem. Also included in the TrainMaster Command system is RailSounds, which provides digital sound effects to complement the digital control features of the system. RailSounds was developed by a separate team of technologists in the Bay Area. An early, distinguishing feature of RailSounds was the fact that each individual locomotive system (e.g. a \\"Hudson\\" 4-6-4 steam locomotive) was based on a real-life counterpart, not a generic \\"steam\\" sound. The Lionel RailSounds Hudson sound system was captured by the Liontech team on location in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, using the former Canadian Pacific \\"Royal Hudson\\" as the sound model. During the 90's Lionel Boom Years, TMCC became one of the most popular O Scale remote systems to use. Introduced in 1994, from the years 1996 to 2002, it had its biggest boom but sales for the TMCC declined since technology had soon caught up with the TMCC system but is still available and many Legacy engines and MTH DCS engines do allow the operation of the older TMCC remote system. By 2006, TMCC was replaced by the Cab-2 and the LEGACY system. TMCC today is used in Lionel products mainly in motorized units, switches, and some accessories. Lionel has since licensed TMCC to some of its competitors, including K-Line, and aftermarket circuit boards are available to add TMCC to O scale and S scale trains that lack the capability. Neil Young's involvement in Liontech was the direct reason for his becoming aware of Kughn's putting Lionel Trains, Inc. up for sale in early 1995. Young saw an opportunity to become at least part owner in the company he revered, and working with Liontech team member Jim Bunte, assembled a marketing plan to attract investors to help underwrite the purchase price. After several meetings with potential lead equity partners, a deal was struck with Martin Davis, former chairman of Paramount / Gulf+Western, who had recently divested his ownership in that company to Sumner Redstone of Viacom. With his proceeds, Davis founded Wellspring Associates, a New York-based investment firm. The acquisition of Lionel Trains, Inc. and its September 1995 transformation into Lionel LLC was Wellspring's first investment. The competitor MTH uses a similar system, called DCS. TMCCII Legacy In their 2006 Volume 2 catalog, Lionel officially unveiled the new TMCCII \\"Legacy\\" system. TMCCII promises to revolutionize the way people control and play with their model trains, by adding more features that mimic prototypical operations of a real railroad, and subsequently, a real locomotive. TMCCII is backwards-compatible with existing TMCC modules, and can work simultaneously with CAB-1 controller. Like TMCCI, the core of the \\"Legacy\\" system is the handheld remote. The CAB-2 remote features, among other new functions, a back-lit LCD screen, back-lit LCD touchscreen keypad (which can toggle between numbers and control icons), a Feedback mode (the controller rumbles reflecting the struggling engine), and rechargeable batteries. The first locomotive to feature TMCCII is the Union Pacific Big Boy. At the moment, only the CAB-2 remote and command base are available, with additional modules being released in due course. The second locomotive that was released was the American Flyer New York Central which arrived back in April 2007.

He was awarded the Silver Star for his gallantry during the attack. Biography Walters grew up in Colorado, where his father was a trombone player at the United States Air Force Academy. The family moved to Salem, Oregon in 1981 where he graduated from North Salem High School. He lived in the Kansas City, Missouri area for about six years. The aspiring writer of children‚Äôs books served in the first Persian Gulf War. He left active duty for the reserves in Independence, Missouri. He worked as a corrections officer and at a jail, and at the airport in Kansas City. He re- entered the Army in the summer of 2002. Walters was a food service specialist (cook) and member of the United States Army 507th Maintenance Company. The exact nature of Walters' death, and its relationship to the Lynch ambush has created controversy. Walters' family had called for an investigation into their son's death, pressuring the Oregon National Guard, who released, on May 27, 2004, information suggesting that Walters was captured and executed. A National Guard spokesman stated that an Iraqi ambulance driver witnessed Walters, still alive, guarded by six Fedayeen, in front of a building. Walters was led inside the building, and several hours later, the same witness delivered his dead body to a hospital. DNA samples recovered from blood in the building match that of Walters, and splatter vectors suggest that he died from two gunshot wounds to the back, from more than twenty feet away. During initial reports after the Lynch rescue, it had been stated that a blonde soldier, presumably Lynch, had fought until she ran out of ammunition, although she later refuted this; although there has been no official investigation into this matter, it has been widely speculated that this soldier was Walters, who is also blond. Walter's mother, Arlene Walters, appeared on the CBS Early Show, making this claim, on May 28. Army reports from 2003 state that Walters died in the fighting during an ambush that left ten others dead; with no U.S. witnesses to his death. It has now been suggested that Walters was separated from his unit; several ammunition magazines were found near the location of Walters' capture, suggesting that he may well have fought until he ran out of ammunition. Before capture, Walters was shot in the leg, stabbed twice with a knife in the abdomen and had a dislocated left shoulder. Walters was interred at the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.Military Times Walters' posthumously awarded Bronze Star was upgraded to the Silver Star for gallantry in action, in March 2004. Walters also received the Prisoner of War Medal.

He was introduced in the 1993 Outsiders comic book series. Faust is the son of the evil magician Felix Faust. His soul is sold by his father to a demon named Nebiros as an infant in exchange for power, but the demon cheats and grants the power to Sebastian instead of his father. Because of this, Faust gains arcane powers of black magic and soul magic that allows him to siphon souls from others and grant him their powers and abilities as well as recharging his own magical powers. In DC Rebirth, Faust retains his origin of being the son of Felix Faust and his soul bargained by his father. However, while traditionally a solo hero, he is instead casts as a former government director of A.R.G.U.S. in charge of Project: Black Room, a program dedicated to collecting mystic artifacts for the United States government. Fictional character biography Sebastian Faust is the son of the evil magician Felix Faust who appeared as an adversary of the Justice League of America in 1962 and an unnamed woman who was Felix's wife. He also has a sister by the name of Fauna. As an infant, he was subjected to a bargain to a demon named Nebiros by his father to receive the natural ability to utilize magical power in exchange for his son's soul. However, the deal left Sebastian with the power his father craved. He would train his son in the mystic arts throughout his childhood, struggling to resist the sway of black magic taught to him. Eventually, after the birth of his sister, his mother developed leukemia and took to the dark arts to relieve herself of the pain temporarily. However, she is killed in front of Sebastian in a car accident. Shortly after, Sebastian ran away from home. Outsiders In the second volume of the Outsiders, Faust works with the Outsiders and assists the team when they reform under the threat of a vampire invasion of Markovia. When Technocrat's bodyguard Charlie Wylde is attacked by a bear, Faust saves him by merging the bear and guard together. However, the bear's violent side results in the deaths of innocent Markovian soldiers. Wylde goes on to fight and lose against his bestial half, and ends up in a zoo, tormented by Sebastian's sister, Fauna. The Outsiders are on the run for some time, having been framed by the head vampire, Roderick, for the murder of the traitorous Queen Ilona. It is not known that Ilona is trying to kill the Outsiders. Eventually the team clears their names. Throughout his tenure, Faust is not trusted by many of his teammates. Despite this, he develops a romantic relationship with the innocent Halo. Soon, Felix, along with Fauna, attacks the team, drawing them into a different dimension. The team suffers various tortures, and survives only due to the flexible laws of reality in this realm. Faust leads an escape attempt. After the team breaks up, Faust tries to pursue a solo career. Day of Judgment During the 1999 DC Comics crossover event, Day of Judgment, Faust joins with other magical characters of the DC Universe to form the Sentinels of Magic. The denizens of Hell have invaded Earth, led by Asmodel, an angel with the powers of Spectre. Faust teams up with a varied group of superheroes, including Atom, Superman, Firestorm and Enchantress. They travel to Hell itself and eventually, to the City of Dis, Hell's center of power, in order to relight its fires. During the trip, the heroes are temporarily trapped under the frozen River Styx. Faust manages to rescue Enchantress first; since he has no soul, he is not tormented by the river's waters. Inside the city, the heroes discover the demon Nebiros, who has stayed behind to guard the frozen fires. In battle, Faust releases Blue Devil, whose bones he had apparently bought from a mysterious marketplace. Nebiros is slain due to Firestorm changing the water in his body to cement. Faust regains his soul. The combined forces of the superheroes are not enough to relight the fires. Faust realizes what must be done and murders Enchantress, losing his soul, restarting the fires, and saving the Earth all at once. Black Baptism Faust next appears during the Black Baptism event. Over the course of the story, he works both with and against the Justice League, before ultimately tapping their souls to stop the mighty sorcerer Hermes Trismegistus. Faust comes to realize his newfound friend, Blue Devil, is only staying with him because of the magical nature of his revival. Not willing to risk Blue Devil's safety, he eliminates the magical connection by plunging the last of Blue Devil's bones into his back. Following the battles, Faust fakes the death of both himself and his father. Blue Devil soon dies in battle against Hermes but is revived. Checkmate Though Faust does not appear in Checkmate #17, Carl Draper mentions that he is brought in as a consultant to lay down magical safeguards to help defend Checkmate's HQ, the Castle. In issue #24 of the series, Faust is revealed as one of the organization's \\"Rooks\\". DC Rebirth In the Suicide Squad: Black Files limited series, Sebastian Faust is re-imagined as one of the former directors of A.R.G.U.S.'s Project: Black Room, a program designed to catalog items of mystic origin and to battle threats of magical origin on behalf of the United States government. Considered the best wizard in America and A.R.G.U.S., he later falls in love with a dryad whom he marries and later becomes pregnant with his child. After a spell he pick up during his missions terminally ills his wife, he takes to planning to rid of magic to cure his wife and unborn child by utilizing arcane tools he acquired from a mystic terror cell and comes into conflict with Suicide Squad Black, an off- shoot of the Suicide Squad consisting of members capable of fighting supernatural threats. He is eventually defeated by this team and is later taken in by the Justice League to be rehabilitated. Powers and abilities Empowered by a demonic bargain, Sebastian Faust is knowledgeable on the occult and is considered one of the most powerful magic users on Earth. An adept spell-caster, Faust's incantations delve into black magic, which said form of magic is noted to often take a heavy toll on its practitioner. Taught to him by his father is soul magic, a form of magic Sebastian surpasses his father in that allows him to manipulate and power himself with the souls others in order to accomplish magical feats such as replenishing his depleted energies, read the aura of others, siphon other's powers like that of the Green Lantern's power ring construct capabilities and the Speed Force. In DC Rebirth, the nature of his powers has changed; Considered the most power magic user in A.R.G.U.S. and America, he is still powered by a demonic bargain given to him by his father. However, he is an expert user of magic capable of taking on powerful magic users such as the Enchantress and Klarion the Witch Boy by speaking verbal commands backwards similarly to Zatanna to perform various feats of magic such as creating magical constructs, discharge magical energy blasts, mind control, casting energy shield, and endowing himself with superhuman durability. He is also a skilled leader and capable of manipulating others to further his own goals.

Phatic expressions are a socio-pragmatic function and are used in everyday conversational exchange typically expressed in situational instances that call for social cues.Vladimir ≈Ωegarac, \\"What IS Phatic Communication?\\", 'Phatic Communication', April 25, 2018 In speech communication the term means \\"small talk\\" (conversation for its own sake) and has also been called \\"grooming talking.\\"\\"Teach Yourself Linguistics\\", by Jean Aitchison, For example, greetings such as \\"hello\\", \\"how are you?\\" (in many contexts), and \\"good afternoon\\" are all phatic expressions. In phatic expressions, speech acts are not communicative, since no content is communicated. According to anthropologist Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, apparently \\"purposeless\\" speech acts‚Äîpolite small talk, like \\"how are you?\\" or \\"have a nice day\\"‚Äîeven though their content may be trivial or irrelevant to the situation, perform the important function of establishing, maintaining, and managing bonds of sociality between participants.Malinowski, B. (1923) \\"The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages‚Äù, in: Charles K. Ogden and Ian A. Richards, The Meaning of Meaning, 296‚Äì336, London: Kegan Paul, Trench and Trubner In Roman Jakobson's work, the 'phatic' function of language concerns the channel of communication; for instance, when one says \\"I can't hear you, you're breaking up\\" in the middle of a cell-phone conversation. This usage appears in research on online communities and micro-blogging. History The term phatic communion ('bonding by language') was coined by anthropologist Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski in his essay \\"The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages\\", which appeared in 1923 as a supplementary contribution to The Meaning of Meaning by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. The term \\"phatic\\" means \\"linguistic\\" (i.e. \\"by language\\") and comes from the Greek œÜŒ±œÑœåœÇ phat√≥s (\\"spoken, that may be spoken\\"), from œÜŒ∑ŒºŒØ phƒìm√≠ (\\"I speak, say\\").Haberland, H. (1996) \\"Communion or communication? A historical note on one of the 'founding fathers' of pragmatics\\", in Robin Sackmann (ed.), \\"Theoretical linguistics and grammatical description\\", 163-166, Amsterdam: Benjamins Phatic expressions in various languages Danish Danish has several phatic greetings: * Hvordan g√•r det? 'how goes it?'. Similar to the English greeting how are you?. Possible answers are: Det g√•r godt/fint 'it goes good/fine'. * Hvor'n sk√¶r'en? 'how does it cut?' Informal greeting between close friends. * Hvad s√•? 'what then?'. Similar to the English greeting what's up?. More often used in Jutland. A possible answer is Ikke s√• meget 'not that much'. * Hej is a very common informal greeting and equivalent to the English hi, pronounced almost the same. Single word greetings with approximately the same meaning include hejsa (from combining hej with German sa from French √ßa), dav, davs (both reduced forms of dag meaning 'day'), goddag, hall√∏j, hall√∏jsa, hall√∏jsovs (Pun greeting. Made by combining hall√∏j and l√∏gsovs 'onion sauce'), p√¶nt goddag 'nice good day' is a more formal greeting. * Hallo is only used when the speaker is not sure they can be heard. Examples when saying/yelling hallo is appropriate: Trying to find out if someone else is in a seemingly empty room/building; using it as an initial phone greeting; checking if the person you're calling can still hear you (when experiencing a bad phone connection); trying to get the attention of a listener that appears to not pay attention. * Mojn is only used in Southern Jutland. It comes from North German moin from the German word Morgen meaning 'morning'. Despite its original meaning it's used as a greeting throughout the day. * Hej hej or farvel are common ways to say goodbye. Vi ses 'we will see each other' is used as a farewell greeting in face-to-face comversations while vi snakkes 'we will speak each other'/vi snakkes ved 'we will speak to each other by' are used in both face-to-face and phone/text conversations. * K√∏r forsigtigt 'drive safely' is said to a person leaving the place where the speaker is located and going to drive/bike to another location. Kom godt hjem 'come well home' is said in the same situation whatever the method of transportation. * God arbejdslyst 'good lust for work' is said when parting with a person that is either currently at work or leaving to go to work. * Tak for i dag 'thanks for today' is often said in more formal contexts of prolonged interactions like at the end of a meeting or the end of a class. * God bedring 'good recovery'. Said when leaving a sick person. * Ha' det godt 'have it good' or du/I m√• ha det godt 'you(sg./pl.) may have it good' is a farewell phrase wishing for the other's well-being. A joke variant of this is Ha' det som I ser ud 'have it as you look' (literally: 'have it as you look out'). By not saying the expected adjective godt 'good', the speaker is violating the maxim of quantity and thereby inferring that they do not think the listener looks good. This can be understood as an insult and is therefore mainly used informally between friends. Some phatic greetings are only used in writings such as letters, e-mails and speeches read aloud: * K√¶re 'dear' followed by a name is a formalised way of beginning a letter, speech etc. * Ways to end a letter or e-mail include hilsen 'greeting', (med) venlig hilsen '(with) friendly greeting', sometimes abbreviated to (m)vh. Others include med k√¶rlig hilsen 'with loving greeting' abbreviated kh, knus 'hug'. Some greetings like hej can be used throughout the day. Some are more specific, and the specific time of when to switch to the next greeting can vary from speaker to speaker. But in general the time-specific greetings are: Godmorgen 'good morning', around 6 AM - 10 AM God formiddag literally 'good pre-noon', around 9 AM - 12 AM Goddag 'good day', around 10 AM - 6 PM God eftermiddag 'good afternoon', around 1 PM - 6 PM Godaften 'good evening', around 6 PM - 12 PM Godnat 'good night', said whenever the listener is going to go to sleep. Thanking: * Ways of say thanks include tak 'thanks', tak skal du have 'thanks shall you have', mange tak 'many thanks', tusind(e) tak 'thousand thanks', tak for det 'thanks for that' and jeg takker 'I thank'. * A thanks can be answered with selv tak 'self thanks' or det var s√• lidt 'it was so little' (referring to the small amount of work that had to be done). Wishes: * Held og lykke 'luck and fortune'. Equivalent to the English good luck. * Kn√¶k og br√¶k 'crack and break' has the same meaning as good luck even though it likely refers to the breaking of bodyparts just like the English expression break a leg. Mostly said by sport fishermen, hunters and theater crews.  Danish Sign Language  Initial greetings HEJ, mouth movement: /hej/ or /dav/ or nothing. Used as a standard greeting equivalent to English hi. I-ORDEN, mouth movement: /bibi/. When repeated twice the sign can be translated as 'is everything going well?'. Farewells VINKE, mouth movement: /farvel/. The sign means 'goodbye' and looks like waving. English \\"You're welcome\\", in its phatic usage, is not intended to convey the message that the hearer is welcome; it is a phatic response to being thanked, which in turn is a phatic whose function is to acknowledge the receipt of a benefit. Similarly, the question \\"how are you?\\" is usually an automatic component of a social encounter. Although there are times when \\"how are you?\\" is asked in a sincere, concerned manner and does in fact anticipate a detailed response regarding the respondent's present state, this needs to be pragmatically inferred from context and intonation. Example: a simple, basic exchange between two acquaintances in a non-formal environment: :Speaker one: \\"What's up?\\" (US English. In UK English this means \\"is there something wrong?\\") :Speaker two: \\"Hey, how's it going?\\" (In US English \\"Hey\\" is equivalent to \\"Hi\\", or \\"Hello\\". Adding \\"How's it going\\" returns the initial greeting-query, paraphrased, without offering any information about what is possibly \\"up\\". In short, the first speaker's token is replied to with the second speaker's equivalent token, not actually answering the first speaker's literal query.) Or: :Speaker one: \\"Alright?\\" (UK English. In US English this means \\"is there something wrong?\\") :Speaker two: \\"Yeah, alright.\\" In both dialogs neither speaker expects an actual answer to the question but rather it is an indication that each has recognized the other's presence and has therefore sufficiently performed that particular social duty.  Icelandic  There are several phatic greetings in Icelandic differing in formality: * Hva√∞ segir√∞√∫ (gott)? 'What say you (good)?'. Equal to English how are you?. To a foreign speaker it can seem strange that the preferred answer, gott 'good', is embedded in the question. A preferred answer can be √©g segi allt gott/f√≠nt 'I say everything good/fine' * Hvernig gengur? 'how goes?'. Thanking: * Takk fyrir 'thanks for'. Japanese In Japanese, phatic expressions play a significant role in communication, for instance the backchannel responses referred to as aizuchi. Other such expressions include the ubiquitous Yoroshiku onegaishimasu (\\"please treat me well\\", used before starting work with someone), Otsukaresama desu (lit. \\"you must be tired\\", closer to \\"thank you for your hard work\\"‚Äîused for leave-taking and sometimes as a greeting) and Osewa ni natteimasu (\\"thank you for your support\\"). Persian Taarof is a complex set of expressions and other gestures in Persian society, primarily reflected in the language. Welsh In Welsh the general phatic is a regional and colloquial version of sut mae? (\\"how is?\\"). The general pronunciation in southern Wales is shw mae and in the North, su' mae.

He is one of the most frequently occurring characters in the Transformers fictional work, appearing in almost all continuities of the Transformers franchise. Generally depicted as a deadly Decepticon who transforms into a jet fighter and who serves as Megatron's second-in-command on Earth, Starscream's defining trait is his desire to overthrow Megatron and take his place as Decepticon leader.  Fictional character biography  Authors have created many characters in the franchise based on the appeal of Starscream's treachery and cunning; most of these share his desire to lead the Decepticons. Starscream has the ambition to overthrow Megatron as the Decepticons' leader. He has controlled the Decepticons at times, but he usually suffers defeat. Starscream is ruthless, cruel, and more intelligent than the average Decepticon, but also, unlikely to act directly on his aspirations without first securing conditions favorable to his ascension. He considers himself vastly superior to other Decepticons and finds Megatron contemptible for his antiquated military strategies and tactics. Starscream believes the Decepticons should employ guile and speed more readily than brute force to defeat the Autobots. However, given the chance to lead, he is often less successful in this than Megatron. While Megatron frequently overlooks him as a threat, authors suggest such reasons for Megatron's tolerance of Starscream's presence as grudging respect for his scheming nature and precautionary observation. Others suggest that Starscream's treacherous nature is welcomed; that without a threat to his command, Megatron believes he would become soft and overconfident, or that he even found his transgressions amusing. Even so, Starscream often quickly exhausts Megatron's patience; violent-yet-brief verbal and/or physical conflicts between the two are not uncommon. As such, there have been times when Megatron has been close to killing Starscream. In his original appearance, Starscream transforms into a McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. As Decepticon Air Commander, he leads the other Decepticon Seeker jets, many of whom share his physical design. His technical specifications indicate top speed as Mach 2.8 and altitude ceiling as . Launchers mounted on his arm (under his wings in jet mode) can deliver cluster bombs capable of leveling a area and fire his signature null ray, which for brief periods disrupts the flow of electricity in any circuitry it contacts. This action temporarily renders inoperable any electronic device or machine, including Transformers.  Animated series   Generation 1  Starscream was formerly a scientist and explorer, working with the future Autobot Skyfire, during the Golden Age of Cybertron, shortly before the Autobot/Decepticon war re-erupted. Following the disappearance of Skyfire when the two were exploring a prehistoric Earth, Starscream returned to Cybertron and soon abandoned his scientific pursuits, becoming a warrior in Megatron's Decepticon army as the civil war exploded. Starscream attended the Cybertron War Academy, mentioned in the episode \\"A Prime Problem\\". Starscream makes use of his old scientist profession in a few episodes. For example, in \\"A Decepticon Raider in King Arthur's Court\\", when he and several other Decepticons were temporarily displaced in time to medieval England, the weapons of the Transformers ceased functioning; Starscream knew how to use available materials to create gunpowder as a substitute for himself and the other Decepticons. In \\"Starscream's Brigade\\", he attempts‚Äîin what was then only his latest in a series of attempts‚Äîto overthrow Megatron as the leader of Decepticons. After being defeated and exiled in Guadalcanal, Starscream finds the remains of some World War II military vehicles, which inspire him to create an army of his own. He travels to Cybertron using the Space Bridge, forcing the guards and eluding Shockwave to do so. He breaks into the Decepticon Detention Center and steals the five personality components of Renegade Decepticons, then installs them into five wrecked military vehicles and they become the Combaticons. The Combaticons (who combine to form Bruticus) and Starscream then capture four Transformers. When Megatron rallies his troops (except the Stunticons) against Starscream and the Combaticons, he deploys Devastator to fight Bruticus, but Devastator is defeated. Megatron attempts to retreat, however Starscream orders Bruticus to capture Megatron and hold him while he gloats and humiliates him. While this is going on, the Stunticons arrive, combine into Menasor and defeat Bruticus. Megatron then orders Astrotrain to exile Starscream and the Combaticons to a distant asteroid. In the next episode, \\"The Revenge of Bruticus\\", the Combaticons blame Starscream for their punishment. They imprison him on Cybertron after he abandons them, and plan a devastating revenge on Megatron by pulling the Earth towards the Sun using Cybertron's controls. After proving his worth in helping Megatron and Optimus Prime (who teamed up to prevent the Earth from meeting its doom) stop the deranged Bruticus, Starscream gets restored to Decepticon ranks and Megatron reprograms Bruticus to obey only him. In The Transformers: The Movie, Starscream and many other Decepticons participate in the battle of Autobot City, leaving several Autobots killed. After the Decepticons' defeat, they retreat in Astrotrain. In order to reduce Astrotrain's mass, the Decepticons were left with no choice but to jettison the heavily damaged Skywarp, Thundercracker and Insecticons into space, and Starscream tosses Megatron, whom Optimus Prime mortally wounded, out of Astrotrain. After that he nominates himself as the new leader of Decepticons. However, during a grandiose coronation ceremony, Megatron, who has been reborn as Galvatron alongside Cyclonus, Scourge and the Sweeps, arrives, declares the coronation a \\"bad comedy\\". Starscream had barely a moment to realize that Galvatron was once Megatron, and Galvatron transforms into laser cannon mode, destroying Starscream with a single shot. However, while Starscream's body has been disintegrated, his \\"spark\\" remains as a ghost and returns later. In \\"Starscream's Ghost\\", he is encountered by his old friend Octane in the Decepticon Crypt and conspires with him to hand Galvatron over to Rodimus Prime, the new leader of the Autobots. Starscream possesses Cyclonus's body and tricks Galvatron into being captured by the Autobots, however Galvatron escapes, returns and shoots Cyclonus, not aware that his second-in-command has been possessed by Starscream's ghost. The vengeful ghost easily escapes and re-appears in an additional episode, \\"Ghost in the Machine\\". In the episode, he first appears possessing Scourge and reactivates the head of Unicron. Starscream then makes a deal with Unicron to restore the latter's sight and body by stealing the eyes of Metroplex and transformation cog of Trypticon, and wiring Unicron's head to Cybertron. Starscream successfully accomplishes most of this, however, when he can no longer possess Scourge, he demands that Unicron restore his own, original body so that he can complete the connections. Unicron complies and again demands that Starscream complete the connections, only to have Starscream double-cross him and tell him to \\"do it himself\\". At this point, the Autobots set off an explosion that blows Unicron's head and Starscream out into space. As Starscream tumbles out of control, he encounters the Decepticons who unleash all of their firepower on him, damaging him and pushing him farther into space. Starscream is not encountered again in G1.  Beast Wars  A G1 incarnation of Starscream returns in Beast Wars: Transformers, voiced by Doug Parker. In the episode \\"Possessed\\", He takes control of Waspinator's body following a lightning storm. The Predacons recognize him as Air Commander Starscream of the Decepticons. Starscream claims that he had been killed in battle defending Galvatron from Unicron, and pledges his allegiance to the Predacon leader Megatron. In reality, he was destroyed by Galvatron, and plots to usurp Megatron and take control of the Predacons. He captures the Maximal base, and later holds Optimus Primal and Dinobot hostage, ordering the Maximals to attack the Predacon base in exchange for their safety. He is defeated by the combined efforts of the Maximals and Blackarachnia, freeing Waspinator's body, and sending Starcream's ghost hurtling back into the depths of space.  Beast Wars II  In the Japanese-exclusive animated series, Beast Wars II, a character named Starscream was one of Galvatron's most loyal minions. Like the Decepticon air commander who came before him, Starscream is both ambitious and deadly. He makes up for his lack of size with unmatched speed and maneuverability. He hopes to one day dethrone Galvatron as the Predacon emperor of destruction and rule the universe himself. He is also slightly effeminate, often laughing and gesturing in a shaky way. When transformed Starscream becomes a stealth fighter capable of soaring at very high speed. In fighter mode he can use the \\"Formation Scream\\" and combine with his loyal partner BB to become a powerful air fighter, in which Starscream forms the rear of the combination. In robot mode his attack of choice are his \\"Screamwinder Missiles\\" which are strong enough to vaporize most opponents. Starscream tries to undermine his equally treacherous rival Megastorm. Starscream, during an assassination attempt, accidentally turned Megastorm into Gigastorm. Gigastorm paid Starscream and BB back in kind, but exposure to Angalmosis energy turned them into Hellscream and Max B. As Hellscream, he has the beast mode of a cyborg shark, whilst Max B transforms into a cyborg wolf. Hellscream is last seen escaping the exploding Nemesis with Max B and Gigastorm. They do not reappear in Beast Wars Neo, leaving Hellscream, Max B, and Gigastorm's fates and activities unknown.  Unicron Trilogy  Armada Starscream's design which was later reused for Generation 1 Starscream in the IDW Publishing comics. The Starscream of the \\"Unicron Trilogy\\" universe has gone through many notable changes in his personality as his story has progressed. At times he is quite similar to his G1 predecessor, but on many other occasions has displayed markedly different traits to his namesake. In \\"Armada\\", Starscream was a young arrogant warrior who desperately wished to gain the approval and respect of his leader Megatron (in contrast of his G1 counterpart), but started to become confused as he started to hate both himself and his commander for the abuse heaped upon him as well as being disgusted with his leader's lack of honor and respect over his troops. He originally came to Earth as part of Megatron's expedition to gain the power of the Mini-Cons alongside Demolishor and Cyclonus. However, Starscream's frustration over having been made the last of the Decepticons to gain his partner Mini-Con led him to be manipulated by Sideways into battling with Megatron, which he lost. His hatred for Megatron eventually led to him siding with the Autobots so he could bring his former leader down once and for all. During his time with the Autobots, he formed a surprisingly close friendship with the human Alexis. However, Thrust eventually manipulated Starscream into rejoining the Decepticons, though Starscream still vowed to destroy Megatron. During the Unicron Battles, Starscream was one of the five Cybertronians who received a power boost from the Mini-Cons, giving him a new blue color scheme that makes him look like Thundercracker. Despite having the original G1 Thundercracker color scheme, Starscream was never renamed into the fellow seeker, but had stated \\"I look like Thundercracker\\" when he gained the new body colors. When Thrust was ousted as a servant of Unicron, Starscream reunited with Alexis and gave chase, though he ultimately failed to catch him. When Megatron, now calling himself \\"Galvatron\\", refused to acknowledge the existence of Unicron and the potential threat he carried, Starscream challenged his leader to a duel and allowed him to stab him in the chest with the Star Saber. After a final sendoff with Galvatron, the seeker pulled the Star Saber out of his chest, exposing his spark, and fired on Unicron directly, only for the Chaos Bringer to fire a bolt of lightning that completely disintegrated Starscream, killing him. Starscream's death ultimately convinced Galvatron of Unicron's existence and he allied the Decepticons with the Autobots to end the threat. In Energon, set ten years later, Alpha Q revives Starscream and wipes all memories of his old life to use him as his personal assassin. However, Megatron eventually gets a hold of Starscream, using his newfound connection with Unicron to brainwash him into his loyal second-in-command. Later in the series, he is exposed to a pool of super energon, making his armor impervious to laser fire as well as recoloring it, making him resemble his original G1 colors. In the final episode, Starscream, along with Mirage, follows Galvatron into an energon sun, Galvatron having done so to break Unicron's hold over him. Starscream returned again in Cybertron as a darker, more ruthless character. While he appears to be loyal to Megatron like he was in Energon, he secretly prepares a coup against him to become leader of the Decepticons. This results in a fracturing of the group, with Starscream discovering a group of ancient Decepticons, including two named Thunderblast and Lugnutz; he also recruits neutral Transformers Sideways and Soundwave. After several encounters, Starscream and Galvatron have one final battle which ends with Starscream, Soundwave, and Sideways being transported into another dimension. He is later located by Wing Saber, who teams up with Landmine and Mudflap to go after him.  Transformers: Animated  Starscream appears in the 2007 animated series, voiced by Tom Kenny. He transforms into a futuristic harrier jet, (sporting a notable similarity to the Variable Fighters of Macross fame in his transformation sequence) and resembles his Generation 1 counterpart in both design, personality, and ambitions. He flies at high speeds in both modes, and wields his trademark null-rays, though these function simply as powerful lasers. He's unintentionally comical in this incarnation displaying occasional incompetence. However, this incarnation displays a resolute tenacity towards his objective, shown by his flying around in a brutally damaged Nemesis to track down the Allspark's energy signature for 50 years by himself. Although slightly cowardly, Starscream is an excellent warrior, since he almost single- handedly took down all of the Autobots in a battle over the Allspark. He is more narcissistic than most incarnations of the character, frequently congratulating and praising himself, his plans and his looks, with absolute glee. During season 2, upon being resurrected by a shard of the Allspark embedded on his forehead, Starscream displays a sense of perseverance in the series, making numerous attempts to eliminate Megatron before and after being destroyed by the Decepticon leader, including creating a squadron of clones that embodied sides of his personality. He also cannot tell the difference between any two humans.  Aligned series  Starscream is part of the main group of Decepticons in the 2010 computer animated series Transformers: Prime. This version is depicted as a much darker character, constantly plotting his rise to becoming the Decepticon leader and mercilessly killing Autobots, as evidenced when he terminates Cliffjumper in the series premiere. He has displayed a contempt for Decepticons who do not choose a flying alternate mode, such as Knock Out. Although he may look weak, he is one of the deadliest Decepticons in history, using his clever skills and lethal weapons such as his missiles. Throughout the first half of season one, Starscream serves as the Decepticons' leader after Megatron is critically injured and placed on life support (aided in his injuries by Starscream's attempt to assassinate him). However, once Megatron revives, Starscream is beaten and punished, returning to his position as second-in-command. Following Megatron's attempt to exterminate Starscream, as well as his further humiliation at the hands of the Decepticon Airachnid, Starscream leaves the Decepticons to strike out as an independent at the end of season one. His attempts to eradicate the Autobots and Megatron range from siding with the human terrorist organization M.E.C.H. (resulting in his loss of flight for most of season two) to cloning himself into an army, all of which end in failure, and he becomes more comedic in his ineptitude. He eventually gains a powerful Iacon relic known as the Apex Armor, and also manages to obtain speed-enhancing red energon, though he loses the former to the Autobot Smokescreen. After learning of the Omega Keys, powerful Cybertronian relics that can be used to revive Cybertron, Starscream decides to steal the Keys from the Autobots and rejoin the Decepticons, at which he succeeds. Upon rejoining, Starscream regains his old position as Megatron's first lieutenant after the destruction of Dreadwing, and is instrumental in the kidnapping of the Autobots' human allies, the creation of the fortress Darkmount on Earth, and the destruction of the Autobot base. In season three, Starscream is forced to share his high-ranking position with Shockwave, and tries to earn Megatron's respect by finding the Autobots before his rival, which results in an outbreak of energon vampires when he foolishly combines Dark Energon with unstable Synthetic Energon, resulting in the loss of over half of the Decepticon forces and Insecticon's Hive. Starscream is also distrustful of Predaking, the Predacon cloned by Shockwave to hunt down the Autobots, a feeling which is proven correct when Predaking shows he is sentient and capable of transforming. It is also he who suggests terminating the Predacon soldiers they have been creating, including Predaking, after he shew his sentient and capacity of transformation, and blaming it on the Autobots, later causing Predaking to turn against them. In \\"Deadlock\\", Starscream and the Decepticons fight the Autobots, and later witness Bumblebee slay Megatron with the Star Saber. Starscream, Shockwave and the other Decepticons then retreat. In the TV movie Predacons Rising, which functions as the finale to the animated series Transformers: Prime, Starscream is shown to share leadership of the Decepticons with Shockwave, who constantly has them move labs to avoid detection. Starscream also helps to command two Predacons, Skylynx and Darksteel, they have cloned as part of their scheme to rebuild the Decepticon army, and is witness with Shockwave to the arrival of Unicron (possessing Megatron's upgraded and resurrected body). Starscream is among those to try and flee when Unicron attacks, but is betrayed by Knockout, who sides with the Autobots. When Megatron is freed from Unicron's control, Starscream is eager to rejoin him, but Megatron rebuffs, saying that he has lost his taste for inflicting oppression, and that the Decepticons are no more. Starscream then eagerly attempts to reinstate himself as leader of the Decepticons, but is confronted by Predaking, Skylynx and Darksteel, who are intent on revenge for their cruel treatment at his hands. Starscream's fate is left ambiguous until the sequel series Transformers: Robots in Disguise. In Transformers: Robots in Disguise, it's revealed Starscream survived, having escaped Skylynx and Darksteel and killed them inadvertently by setting off a room full of weapons that were capable of destroying even Predacons, in Darkmount on Cybertron. After reformatting his body, Starscream hid until he could regain his full power, tracking seven Minicons Megatron had been experimenting on to give himself even greater power than a Prime. This led the Autobots to believe he was dead and allowed him to operate incognito. At some point after his escape, Starscream located the Weaponizer Minicons as part of his plans for revenge and galactic conquest and promptly began hunting them down, hiring an Insecticon, and two mercenaries named Roughedge and Shadelock to help him find the escaped Mini-Cons on Earth. He also came into possession of Megatron's Dark Star Saber and promptly took control of it, though the sword began rejecting him and he could not access its full power. Nevertheless, he still desired the Mini-Cons as part of his goals and ended up having Fixit, Jetstorm and Slipstream brought to him when they were captured by mistake. After learning that his old enemy, Bumblebee, was on Earth, he threatened to terminate the Minicons unless Bumblebee surrendered to him. Bumblebee promptly did so in order to secure their release. Unfortunately for Starscream, Optimus returned and defeated him while he was powered up by the Minicons, with the help of Bumblebee's team. Starscream fell comatose and was loaded onto Optimus's ship for transport back to Cybertron and justice.  Books  Starscream appears in the following books: * The 1984 sticker and story book Return to Cybertron written by Suzanne Weyn and published by Marvel Books. * The 1984 sticker and story book The Revenge of the Decepticons written by Suzanne Weyn and published by Marvel Books. * The 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called Battle Drive by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel. * The 1985 Transformers audio books Autobots' Lightning Strike, Megatron's Fight For Power, Autobots Fight Back and Laserbeak's Fury, as well as Galvatron's Air Attack from the 1986 series. * The 1985 audio book Sun Raid. * The 1986 story and coloring book The Lost Treasure of Cybertron by Marvel Books. * Starscream was featured in the 1993 Transformers: Generation 2 coloring book \\"Decepticon Madness\\" by Bud Simpson. Starscream appears in the novel Transformers: Exodus, and its sequels; Transformers: Exiles and Transformers: Retribution. Here he and the Seekers were the bodyguards of Sentinel Prime, but captured him and pledged their allegiance to Megatron when the war between Autobots and Decepticons broke out. Starscream proved to be a treacherous subordinate as usual, looking for every opportunity to play both sides to his advantage so that his circumstances would be favorable regardless of the outcome. In an attempt to see Megatron destroyed, he released Sentinel Prime so that the deposed leader could eliminate the leader of the Decepticons, only to see Sentinel Prime fall. Starscream attacked Megatron himself, but proved unable to defeat the Decepticon leader and was forced to submit to his authority again. He would join the crew of the Nemesis, and continue to seek Megatron's overthrow through a bargain with the Quintessons.  Comics   Marvel Comics  Serving as one of Megatron's elite troops in the attack on the Ark, the Marvel Comics incarnation of Starscream possessed the desire to take leadership of the Decepticons, but in the early days of the war on Earth, he did not accomplish any notable acts apart from nearly getting scrapped by Megatron after one snide comment. When he participated in an attack on the Ark with several of his fellow Decepticons, Starscream was deactivated by Omega Supreme, and sealed in a stasis pod in the Ark for a prolonged period of time. At the same time, the U. K. offices of Marvel Comics were producing their own story-lines which were interspersed throughout the U.S. material. Simon Furman portrayed the character's scheming and ambition with more subtlety than the animated series, making Starscream more intelligent and cunning. He was often the focus of his own stories, including a Christmas special based around Starscream's misery at being stranded on Earth. In this story and in many others written by Furman, Starscream often came across as wry and sarcastic. He was one of the most formidable warriors in the Decepticon army and adversaries were often shown to be visibly intimidated by him. Starscream made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel Generation 2 comic series; in a story called \\"New Dawn\\" Megatron led his Decepticons against Jhiaxus' second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.  Fun Publications  Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics). Megatron survived the crash of the Ark on Earth. He is joined by Starscream, who realized he needed a leader. In Transformers: Timelines volume 2 #2, \\"Games of Deception\\" Megatron detects the arrival of Bugbite's ship on Earth and sends Starscream, Skywarp and Ramjet to investigate. The three Seekers are then taken over by Bugbite's cerebro shells (with Starscream swearing to painfully dismember Bugbite for it). When the Autobots eventually jam the shells to facilitate their own rescue of Mirage, Starscream is freed and battles Bugbite's faction. Whether he survived the battle is unknown. He seems to retain his usual second-in-command status in this story. Starscream reported to Deathsaurus on the success of the Combaticons' attack on the Autobot Elite Guard. = Shattered Glass = This Starscream is a morally good version of the Generation 1 character from the BotCon exclusive \\"Shattered Glass\\" comic, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots on the side of evil. This version is loyal to Megatron, as opposed to his normally treacherous portrayal. He longs to return to his life as a scientist. Also, Megatron treats Starscream with far more respect and considers him a genius. Starscream appears in the 2008 April Fool's comic Shattered Expectations by Fun Publications. He and Razorclaw confront his world's Goldbug, Grimlock and Jazz. When the Autobots refuse to surrender the Decepticons call in the Mayhem Suppression Squad. Starscream then appears in the BotCon 2008 Timelines comic Transformers: Timelines story \\"Shattered Glass\\" as one of the troops of the heroic Decepticon Megatron. Starscream, Divebomb and Whisper drop \\"glass gas\\" bombs on the Autobot's Ark launch platform to make it vulnerable to attack. Starscream appears in the fiction Dungeons & Dinobots, a text based story from Fun Publications. He defends the Arch-Ayr fuel dump from an Autobot attack. The toy for the heroic Starscream is redeco of the Cybertron Voyager Starscream, and was available only at the 2008 BotCon. His color scheme is an homage to the Generation 1 Autobot Jetfire. = Transtech = Another incarnation of Starscream works in civil intelligence on Transtech Cybertron. This Starscream appeared in the Fun Publications story \\"Transcendent\\", where he reported his findings on Skyfall and Landquake to Optimus Prime. Prowl and Starscream had a biographies printed by Fun Publications.  Dreamwave Productions  In the 21st century re-imagining of the Generation One universe by the comics company Dreamwave Productions, Starscream remained his treacherous, power-hungry self. In the early days of the war on Cybertron, he devastated Iacon with a terraforming process, and went on to form his own faction called the Predacons when Megatron vanished in a space-bridge experiment. Dreamwave Productions produced a companion comic for the G1 toyline just as Marvel Comics produced, it was different from the animated continuity. In these comics, the Armada incarnation of Starscream had a much smaller role, but was written in a fashion much closer to the original treacherous G1 character - a trait that would ultimately lead to his seeming demise when the Energon comic book began. He still possessed elements of the animated Armada Starscream, such as an unwillingness to shy away from battle. Starscream would appear in many of Megatron's subsequent schemes, including capturing Swindle, attempting to capture Mini-Cons for his own use and launching an attack on the Mini-Con base on the Moon. His next appearance would be 10 years after Unicron's defeat. When Starscream gatecrashed a meeting of the Terrorcons ‚Äì renegade Decepticons who were unhappy with the peace between Autobot and Decepticon that had emerged in the wake of Unicron's defeat ‚Äì at an energon plant, his mistake soon became apparent when he discovered that they had struck a deal with Unicron and gained new \\"Hyper Mode\\" powers. When their leader, Scorponok, arrived, Starscream was unable to talk himself out of trouble and was blasted into the plant's machinery by Scorponok, seemingly dying. But Starscream survived. The raw energon in the plant reacted in some mysterious way, giving him a ghostly body of pure energon (like the cartoon Energon version, this was also a homage to the ghost form of the original Starscream). In this form he ended up attacking Demolishor and draining him of his energy. Due to the collapse of Dreamwave, the series was stopped.  Devil's Due Publishing  In this crossover from Devil's Due Publishing, the Ark was discovered by the terrorist Cobra Organization, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by the Televipers.  IDW Publishing  After Dreamwave's closure, the rights to the Transformers comics were taken up by IDW Publishing. Their version of the Generation One universe begins with a miniseries called The Transformers: Infiltration. His alternate mode here is that of an F-22 Raptor, foreshadowing the events of the 2007 live action movie. Beast Wars Second Starscream had a biography printed in the Beast Wars Sourcebook by IDW Publishing. IDW also published a one-shot Transformers story as part of their Deviations series that heavily featured Starscream: \\"'Til All Are One.\\" In this story, an alternate version of events from The Transformers: The Movie, Starscream took over leadership of the Decepticons after Megatron was killed by Optimus Prime. Thus, it was Starscream who first encountered Unicron and allied the Decepticons to him, after being upgraded by Unicron's power into the mighty Megascream. He briefly hunted the Autobots in an effort to destroy the Matrix of Leadership, but later turned against his benefactor when Unicron devoured one of Cybertron's moons, which Starscream saw as his own. When Unicron attacked Cybertron itself and Optimus Prime arrived to try and stop him, Megascream demanded that he hand over the Matrix, and combined with Astrotrain, Soundwave, Ramjet, and Dirge into a massive new form. However, Hot Rod soon arrived to rescue Optimus, and unleashed the power of the Matrix, resulting in Unicron's demise as well as that of Megascream and himself.  Combiner Wars  In conjunction with the Combiner Wars (Unite Warriors in Japan) line, Takara Tomy released a comic detailing how the Galvatronus combiner came to be. Following his defeat at the conclusion of The Headmasters, Galvatron's icy tomb was discovered by Cyclonus, whose body Galvatron modified to accommodate his own head in the chest compartment. Seeking a more fitting form, Galvatron directed Cyclonus to approach the disembodied head of Unicron, who was convinced to help Galvatron attain a combiner form with Cyclonus as its core. To accomplish this, Unicron used his power to open dimensional rifts in order to bring Curse Armada Thrust, Zombie War Breakdown, and Wandering Roller into their world. To Cyclonus' surprise, Starscream then made an appearance, expressing interest in joining this new alliance. Unicron promptly granted Starscream a new physical form, and Galvatron's head took control of his new minions to take on his new form of Galvatronus.  Video games  Starscream appears as a playable character in Hasbro's Net Jet fighting game Transformers Battle Universe. Although other playable Transformers have several incarnations featured, the only playable incarnation of Starscream is the Generation 1 version. Starscream is among the characters appearing in the 2004 Transformers video game for the PlayStation 2. He appears as a level boss, battling the player's character at two points. In 2007, Starscream appears as a playable character in Activision's Transformers: The Game voiced by Daniel Ross. In the Decepticon campaign, Starscream acts as Decepticon leader until Megatron's resurrection. In the Autobot campaign, he is defeated by Jazz. A color scheme of Generation 1 Starscream is available by completing the Decepticon Campaign. In the DS game Transformers: Autobots, Starscream serves as a boss at the end of the Arctic levels, trying and failing to kill Ironhide. In Transformers: Decepticons Starscream initially serves as Create-A-Bot's mentor, but secretly plotted to seize the AllSpark for himself. After killing Bumblebee, Starscream took the AllSpark, killing Megatron loyalist Blackout and Barricade, and battled Megatron and his disillusioned apprentice. Megatron evetually executed him for his treason. The G1 Starscream colour scheme also appears as an unlockable bonus form for Create-A-Bot, and a Target exclusive for Transformers: Decepticons, and can be obtained by earning 2500 tokens through Wi-Fi play. Starscream appears as a playable Decepticon character in the 2010 video game Transformers: War for Cybertron, voiced by Sam Riegel. He is playable in the level \\"Starscream's Brigade\\", is a boss in the Autobot level \\"Defend Iacon\\" and is Megatrons opponent in the level \\"Dark Energon\\". His body type is available to use for the player's multiplayer custom Decepticon scientist, although the body is arguably just that of a generic seeker. He is playable in escalation mode. Starscream also appears as a level boss in the Nintendo DS video game Transformers: War for Cybertron Decepticons. Starscream was initially depicted in the game as a neutral in the war, as the guardian of an ancient station dedicated to creating Dark Energon, due to having been demoted. After Megatron invaded the station, Starscream tried to stop him, while Megatron tempted him with power. After Megatron showed he could wield Dark Energon, Starscream officially joined the Decepticons. He, Thundercracker and Skywarp then reactivated the Energon Bridge to create more Dark Energon. Later, during the Battle of Iacon City, Starscream led the Decepticons aerial squadrons, and refused to send Dark Energon bombers, feeling they would be wasted. Megatron overrode his refusal, but after Megatron was presumed dead battling Omega Supreme, Starscream declared himself leader. Megatron eventually managed to tell Starscream to attack Omega Supreme, as a distraction tactic. Later, Starscream was ready to sound a retreat, which Megatron overrode by threatening to execute any retreating Decepticon. In the follow up Autobot Campaign, Starscream fought his former ally Jetfire and Silverbolt, and attacked Optimus's group in the Decagon. However, Starscream was injured by Optimus's axe and forced to retreat. He appears again in the sequel Transformers: Fall of Cybertron. In this game, after Megatron is seemingly killed, Starscream takes over as leader. However, he used most of the Decepticons energy supplies to further his own ego. After the Decepticons failed to capture the energon the Autobots had taken from their base, Starscream called off the attack. However, the rebellious Combaticons disobeyed him, and managed to capture it, albeit losing half of the supply. Starscream arrested them for their treachery, along with all those who defied his reign. Afterwards, Starscream decided to have a coronation, as a homage to The Movie, but was dethroned by the revived Megatron. As a playable character in the level \\"Starscream's Betrayal\\", he snuck into Shockwave's lab and encountered the captured and experimented upon Grimlock. Offering Grimlock freedom as long he served him, Grimlock instead freed himself by throwing Starscream into a control panel. Starscream's fate after this is unknown. However, due to Hasbro setting the \\"Cybertron\\" games in the same continuity as Transformers Prime, he presumably rejoins Megatron's Decepticons. In Transformers: Prime - The Game, Starscream is present in the first level.  Transformers Cinematic Universe  During production of the live-action film, writer Alex Kurtzman stated that Starscream would not stray from his treacherous roots as he seeks to overthrow Megatron, and frequently engages in arguments with him. In the first film, he is seen vehemently pledging his allegiance to Megatron when the latter breaks free from the Hoover Dam, but unlike the other Decepticons, he is not killed in the final battle and leaves Earth at the end of the movie. Starscream transforms into a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. Starscream is armed with a rotary cannon, missile launchers and a saw. When in jet mode, he can simulate the presence of a human pilot, the same holographic model (referred to as \\"Mustache Man\\" on-set and in the credits) that \\"pilots\\" Blackout and \\"drives\\" Barricade. The actor is Air Force Major Brian Reece, a helicopter pilot instructor at Kirtland Air Force Base. A Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, the jet Starscream is based on.  Role in the films  In the first film, Starscream rallies the other Decepticons to battle once Frenzy alerts them to the All Spark's location. Starscream disguises as an F-22 Raptor providing cover for humans in Mission City and severely injures Bumblebee. After flying through the city, Starscream attempts to take the All Spark from Sam, but is later attacked by both Ironhide and Ratchet. Ironhide takes the most damage, while Ratchet was able to hold his ground against Starscream's attacks. He transforms back into jet mode and flies away, leaving Ironhide and Ratchet damaged. He then assists Megatron in going after the All Spark by shooting down the helicopter that was going to extract the Cube from Sam. Later, he attacks several F-22 Raptors flying through Mission City. Due to him transforming into a Raptor himself, Starscream was able to escape the jets as they were firing back at him. After Megatron was killed by Sam, Starscream retreats into deep space. In the second film, Starscream is first seen aboard the Nemesis shipwreck and is confronted by a returning Megatron, angry that Starscream left him to die. Starscream explains that he and The Fallen engineered a new army of Decepticons, but reveals to Megatron that without sufficient energon levels to feed them, the hatchlings destined to become the new army will keep dying. Later in a factory near Sam's college, Starscream watches as Megatron plans to cut out Sam's brain and later Optimus Prime and Bumblebee arrive. Starscream joins Megatron and Grindor in a battle against Optimus Prime in the forest, which resulted in Optimus cutting off Starscream's right arm and ripping Grindor's head in half, however Megatron managed to kill Optimus by stabbing him in the back and shooting his spark out. Megatron and Starscream retreat as the Autobots arrive to save Sam. Megatron berates Starscream again after failing to capture the human. During the battle in Egypt, Starscream informs Megatron about the NEST soldiers and the Autobots planning to resurrect Optimus with the Matrix of Leadership. Starscream then leads the Decepticons on the hunt for Sam and Mikaela, sends Rampage after them, and leads the assault against the Autobots and NEST. After The Fallen was killed by super-mode Optimus Prime and Megatron was badly damaged, Starscream advises his leader to escape. In the third film, Starscream first appears alongside Megatron, Soundwave, and Laserbeak in Africa. He gloats about Megatron's weakened state, which angers his master. In Washington DC, after Sentinel Prime betrayed the Autobots, Megatron and Starscream both witness Sentinel Prime bring an army of Decepticons to Earth from the Moon. He later shoots down the Autobot spaceship, the Xantium, after they have been exiled by the U.S. government. After the Autobots are thought to be dead, Megatron, Starscream, and Sentinel witness as the city of Chicago is being invaded and attacked by a massive Decepticon army. During the battle in Chicago, he meets Sam again and mocked him. Sam uses a grappling glove that was given to him by Que/Wheeljack to take out Starscream's right eye. Starscream then panics and sends Sam flying through the air then through a window of a nearby building. NEST soldiers led by Lennox arrive and they attack Starscream. Sam finally kills him using a boomstick given by Que/Wheeljack and stabs him in the other eye, blinding him and eventually blowing his head up. In Transformers: Age of Extinction, a photo of Starscream appears with a red X indicating his death. In Transformers: The Last Knight, Starscream's rebuilt head is shown being boasted by Daytrader, and later being held by Megatron. In Bumblebee, Starscream appears during the battle on Cybertron in a non-speaking cameo and is commanded by Soundwave to attack the Autobots. Unlike the previous films, he resembles his G1 incarnation and has his original color scheme. Other media = Books = In the prequel novel Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday, it is revealed that Starscream is the leader of the Decepticons following Megatron's disappearance during his search for the Allspark. He and a crew of Decepticons travel aboard the Nemesis to search for the Allspark and Megatron, although Starscream is more focused on finding the cube then his lost master. Blackout opposes him at every turn (rightly not trusting Starscream and thinking that he would prefer that they never find Megatron), while Barricade tolerates it only as a means of finding Megatron. Encountering Ghost-1, a human craft of Cybertronian design, Starscream manipulates them into revealing that Megatron and the Allspark are on Earth, then betrays them. After winning a fierce duel with Blackout for leadership, he launches a full-scale assault on the Autobots. Just as he and Bonecrusher almost kill Optimus Prime, Starscream is severely injured by Ghost-1. In retaliation, he destroys the human craft before retreating. Starscream returns in Transformers: The Veiled Threat. With Megatron dead, Starscream eventually returns to Earth around Zambia, where he gains control over local rebel groups by using his internal synthesizers to create gold coins. = IDW Publishing = The back story of the Transformers on ancient Cybertron is told in Transformers: Defiance. In this story, Starscream returns to Cybertron after encountering an enemy scout ship in the Eshems Nebula. After being repaired for minor damage by Ratchet, Starscream and Ironhide report to Optimus Prime and Megatron. Later, the planet is invaded by aliens from the Eshems Nebula and Starscream is among the defenders in the city of Metrotitan, near the temple at Simfur. In issue #2, he sides with Megatron in his decision to counterattack Cybertron's invaders and is among the fleet that attacks their ships. Starscream also appears at the end of issue #3 of Transformers: Movie Prequel, where he, Blackout and Barricade destroy the Mars Beagle probe. In issue 4, he travels to Earth, gaining his F-22 alternate mode by scanning an experimental Raptor before shooting it down. He appears in the official movie sequel comic called \\"The Reign of Starscream\\". In Transformers: Rising Storm, it is shown that Starscream has broken away from Megatron's rule, and formed his own army - Club Starscream - with Barricade and some others under his command. However, after blasting his way past Ruination and Deadlift, Shockwave tells Starscream that Megatron requires his services. Shockwave then sends Starscream to recover the drone called Brains. = Titan Magazine = In \\"Twilight's Last Greaming\\" part 3, Starscream and Scorponok attack the Autobots Arcee, Armorhide, Elita One, Longarm, Skyblast and Strongarm on the moon. Starscream would return in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called \\"The Decepticon who Haunted Himself\\". = Video games = In the Nintendo DS Transformers: Decepticons game voiced by Daniel Ross, Starscream would kill Barricade and Blackout (and perhaps Brawl, who disappears after killing Ironhide), steal the Allspark, and betray Megatron. Starscream is fought by Megatron as the final boss after he is heavily damaged and loses the AllSpark to Create-A-Con. After being defeated, Megatron kills Starscream for being a traitor, as well as Create-A- Con for being weak. In Transformers Autobots, he is a simple boss who ambushes Ironhide and the Autobot Create-A-Bot in the Arctic but retreats after a long battle and does not reappear or heard of again. Starscream is among the playable characters in the 2009 Revenge of the Fallen video game by Activision. In the Nintendo DS game, Revenge of the Fallen: Decepticons, Starscream was the temporary leader of the Decepticons until The Fallen forces him to revive Megatron. Starscream appears in the 2011 Dark of the Moon video game. As a Hunter, he can be played on Xbox Campaigne and multiplayer Starscream is among the characters who appear in the TRANSFORMERS CYBERVERSE Battle Builder Game.  Toys  Illustration of the patent for the toy that became Starscream and his many repaints. Art by Kohjin Ohno. The original Starscream toy was originally part of the Japanese Diaclone toy line and was designed by Kohjin Ohno in the early eighties. It was imported to become part of the Transformers toy line by Hasbro in 1984. The toy was later re-issued in Japan in 2001, with black-and-gold and translucent \\"ghost\\" variants, and again in 2003, redecorated into a more cartoon-accurate color scheme. He was also reissued in the west in 2003, with extended missiles to comply with safety regulations. Japan re-released Starscream once again in 2007 for their \\"Encore Series\\". A highly prized collectable, the original Starscream toy has sold over $2000 on eBay. The original Starscream toy was altered somewhat and an electronic sound maker was added for the Generation 2 toy line. Beast Wars Second Starscream had two toys produced exclusively in Japan. In 1997 he was released as a black redeco of Generation 2 Smokescreen. This same toy was recolored into Robot Masters Smokesniper. In 1998 he was released as \\"Hellscream\\", a remold of Beast Wars Cybershark. This second toy was eventually released with a slight color change in the US as Universe Overbite. Hellscream was voted the 9th strangest Transformers Beast Wars figure by Topless Robots. The Armada toy was the first new-mould Starscream figure since 1990, and it clung to tradition with a jet alternate mode and a robot form featuring many callbacks to the original Starscream figure, such as shoulder- wings, air intakes on the shoulders, a cockpit in the chest, and a head-sculpt designed to look like the original animated character. When the Mini-Con port on his backpack is pulled back and held, an electronic jet-take off noise is made. Attaching his Mini-Con partner Swindle to this port, however, unlocks his shoulder-mounted null laser cannons, and changes the sound to a repeating laser blast. Swindle can also mount under the jet-mode nosecone ‚Äì by pressing the cockpit, Swindle is dropped to the ground with an accompanying electronic noise, while a press without Swindle attached yields more noises. In robot mode, Starscream's left wing can detach and unfold into a sword for him to wield. Starscream for the 2007 and 2009 movie had numerous toys released. He was one of two promotional figures released long before the 2007 movie as a \\"protoform\\". During the 2007 film release he was sold in various size classes as a licensed F-22 Raptor replica. These toys were recolored and released as fellow Decepticons Ramjet, Skywarp and Thundercracker. During the 2009 film he was released as both redecos of the 2007 film toys as well as new molds. All toys of this character are officially licensed from Lockheed Martin. Animated Starscream also received numerous toys in many size classes during the run of the Animated toy line. Many of the Starscream toys were recolored as his clones Skywarp, Thundercracker, Ramjet, Dirge and Sunstorm. In 2008 a McDonald's Happy Meal was produced with a simple transforming Starscream toy inside to promote the series. This Starscream was also released in the Universe toy as a small Legends figure, shipping with a whole wave of tiny Animated characters. In Japan the Starscream figures were released in metallic finish by Takara.

For the Halo video game series by Microsoft, see Halo (franchise) and Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo is a fictional superheroine that appears in comic books published by DC Comics. She first appeared in a special insert in The Brave and the Bold #200 (July 1983), and was created by Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo. Publication history Halo first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #200 and was created by Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo. Fictional character biography Halo is a gestalt of a human woman named Violet Harper and an Aurakle, an ancient energy-being resembling a sphere of iridescent light. The Aurakle species emerged from the Source billions of years ago at the dawn of time. When sociopath Violet Harper was murdered by Syonide, an operative of the 100 and Tobias Whale, the Aurakle, who had been observing her out of curiosity, was sucked into the newly vacant body, reanimating the deceased body. The shock of the death and resurrection induced a profound loss of memory in the new combined entity. She was subsequently found and recruited by Batman to serve as a member of the Outsiders. In one early incident, Halo gains access to the memories of the long-lived Aurakle and becomes emotional over the tendency of human beings to kill each other. Halo later has to deal with the consequences of her body's previous actions, which required the assistance of the Outsiders team to resolve. The young Halo is initially the legal ward of her friend and Outsiders teammate Katana. During her stint in the Outsiders, she gains a friend in new member Windfall.Adventures of the Outsiders #34 (June 1986) Death Halo did die, in a manner of speaking, in a much later incident. After the team was framed for the murder of Markovia's queen, which was caused by Roderick and his vampire forces, they were forced to flee. Technocrat's evil ex-wife, Marissa Barron, hires an old associate named Ryer who believes Technocrat had abandoned him in Markovia. As the cyborg Sanction, he nearly kills the Outsiders in Switzerland. Later, in Gotham City, he attacks again, slaying both Marissa and Halo. As with Violet Harper, Halo's essence is sucked into Marissa's body, reanimating it. During an attempt by the Outsiders to create a new headquarters, other Aurakles would return to reclaim Halo. Halo would later strike up a relationship with Sebastian Faust, a fellow Outsider that not many on the team trusted. The entire team is eventually cleared of wrongdoing. Halo later returns to Markovia. There she assists in combating a portal to Hell that had opened as part of the Day of Judgment incident. Further adventures Halo later appears back in the body of its original host, Violet Harper, through unexplained means. During the Infinite Crisis, supervillain prisons around the world are opened as their respective wardens are targeted and blackmailed. Halo is part of a makeshift team of heroes battling a breakout at the Alcatraz prison in San Francisco. She later joins the Battle of Metropolis, which takes place in issue #7, helping other heroes protect the city from an army of super-villains bent on its destruction. Soon after the events of the crisis, she assists a team of astronauts in a space station searching for heroes missing in action. She detects traces of Zeta radiation, a sign of Adam Strange, one of the many missing. She is part of another multi-hero battle, this time against the murderous Black Adam. This takes place on Chinese soil, during the limited series World War III. She makes another brief appearance in Action Comics #843. She is part of dozens of super-powered beings fighting to free themselves from the prison ships of the \\"Auctioneer\\". In Batman and the Outsiders Special (Feb. 2009), Halo is one of the heroes approached by Alfred to form a new team of Outsiders. She accepts in Outsiders vol. 4, #15 and reforms the team with original members Katana, Geo-Force, Black Lightning, and Metamorpho, along with new members Owlman and the Creeper. Blackest Night During a recovery mission with the Outsiders, Halo, along with the Creeper and Katana, are confronted by Katana's recently resurrected family. Under the control of their Black Lantern rings, they attack Katana and Halo, with Creeper easily dispatched; he retreats into the woods to get help from their prisoner, Killer Croc. While Katana battles her husband, Halo is forced to fight Katana's children. Although her light-based powers prove ineffective at first, Violet unleashes more power than ever before in order to save her teammates, whose abilities have no long-term effect on the Lanterns. Finally, she manages to destroy the Black Lantern rings and goes to aid the rest of her team who are also under attack.Outsiders vol. 4, #24 (November 2009) Back in their headquarters, the rest of the Outsiders are faced with a recently risen Terra and are hopelessly outmatched until Halo intervenes. With great effort, she manages to separate Terra from her ring and to destroy it while Geo-Force turns Terra's body to stone in order to keep her from coming back again. Violet, however, seems to disperse into light, her last words being that the (light) is calling her.Outsiders vol. 4, #25 (December 2009) Afterward, Halo is returned to Earth.Outsiders vol. 4, #31 (July 2010) Batman Incorporated Halo is later selected as a member of a new team of Outsiders, led by Red Robin and funded by Batman Incorporated.Batman Inc. #6 (May 2011) Halo and her teammates infiltrate a satellite said to be run by the villainous Leviathan organization, but this is revealed to be a trap set by Lord Death Man and Talia al Ghul. The satellite is destroyed in a massive explosion, making it unclear whether Halo and the others survived.Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes #1 (December 2011) In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, it is revealed that Halo and the Outsiders had survived the explosion but were assumed dead. They now work as part of the Dead Heroes Club, a group of heroes who take advantage of their legally-deceased status to perform covert missions for Batman.Batman Incorporated (vol. 2) #1 (May 2012) In a later series, Halo is once again shown as very naive, freshly rescued from an incident in Markovia. She is under the care of Katana. The government believes Halo simply to be a young girl, unaware of her alien origin and powers.Suicide Squad: Black Files #1 (2018) Powers and abilities Halo has the ability to fly and to create auras of the seven known rainbow colors around herself, called halos, which have different effects: * Violet: Self-healing abilities and resurrection, and can produce empowering mental effects that can give her previous body's consciousness control of their shared body. * Indigo: Tractor beam * Blue: Duplicate herself and objects into several holographic copies. * Green: Produce halting stasis beams to stop and manipulate enemies. * Yellow: Rays of yellow light from hands that can stun or blind enemies. * Orange: Concussive blasts * Red: Create a strong energy shield, Levitation and produce destructive heat beams to melt or burn enemies. * White: Emit a blinding white light that is strong enough to overcome shadows and dark energies. The halos provide a measure of defense against similar effects directed against her. For instance, her green stasis halo protected her from being immobilized by the Cryonic Man's freezing gas, and her orange concussive halo can repel physical attacks. Halo can alternate between her costume and civilian clothes instantly. This transition is accompanied by an aura of primarily black color with white blotches of light. The negation of the color spectrum will negate Halo's powers; the DC universe has many villains with just such abilities. In the 1990s, it was shown that should her human body be destroyed, the Aurakle can merge with another recently deceased human. During the Blackest Night, Violet's powers proved highly effective, allowing her to destroy Black Lanterns and their rings, a feat usually reserved only for the wielders of the various Lantern Corps and the users of the Dove power. Other versions The Elseworlds series JLA: Another Nail contains an alternate Halo, as a black woman; her real name and background are unrevealed. In other media Television * Halo appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!\\" as part of the Outsiders. Here she helps battle the forces of terrorist organization of Kobra. * Halo appears in the third season of Young Justice, voiced by Zehra Fazal. This incarnation of the character is the product of the spirit from a Mother Box reviving the body of Gabrielle Daou, a dead Quraci refugee who had been used as a test subject to stimulate a person's \\"meta-gene\\" (even if a person has a meta-gene, there is a chance that the procedure to awaken it would kill that person), and seeing herself as a new individual, names herself Violet Harper. Her previous incarnation, Gabrielle Daou, was kidnapped and killed by metahuman traffickers in Markovia, and her body thrown in a shallow grave. Simultaneously, the traffickers' colleagues dissected a Mother Box (killing it in the process), causing it to explode in a bright flash of light; its spirit then inhabited and reanimated Daou's corpse (it had been sensing her pain and was trying to reach out to her to help, when Simon Ecks' attempts at dissection took their toll). Violet woke up as a \\"blank slate\\" with minor traces of Daou's personality, memories, and fondness for the hijab (as wearing it makes her feel more comfortable), as well as fleeting access to the Mother Box's knowledge and some of its powers. She was then rescued by Tigress, who gave her the nickname \\"Halo\\", and went on to live with her afterward before joining Nightwing's team. During their time with the group, they help her discover who and what she is and was, and a vast range of powerful abilities she has. She also develops a romantic relationship with the exiled Prince Brion of Markovia. She and the other three rookie hero members later joined the Team. It is also revealed that Halo does not see herself as either female or male, instead as the combination of Mother Box and human combining to make something new, which Halo describes as \\"just me\\", but she still prefers female pronouns. In \\"Leverage\\", as a result of the Team's run-in with the Suicide Squad, Daou's residual memories flash through Halo's mind, revealing that before kidnapping her, the Markovian traffickers had Daou abet their assassination of Brion's parents. In \\"Early Warning\\", Dr. Helga Jace reveals to Halo that she is dying as her cells are not regenerating due to overuse of her violet aura. As a result, she starts hanging out with high school classmate and new friend Harper Row more often as they go to an empty beach to shoot guns and engage in underage drinking; Harper abruptly kisses Violet, leaving Violet feeling very lost and confused about what was happening. However, she did not reciprocate the kiss. Later, Violet is shown to be still troubled by Harper kissing her, which causes problems in her relationship with Brion. In \\"Unknown Factors\\", Granny Goodness realizes Violet can access the Anti-Life Equation. In \\"Antisocial Pathologies\\", it turns out Helga lied about Halo dying and Gabrielle was not merely murdered by Count Vertigo's thugs, but was euthanized by Helga when she tested negative for the metagene. She is later kidnapped and mind-controlled by Granny Goodness to use her powers as a component to create the Anti-Life Equation, as her human body has no safeguards like Mother and Father Boxes do to prevent it, where she manages to enslave most of the Justice League and Team members, until she is rescued by Victor Stone. Afterwards, Violet frees everyone from their mind controlled state and is happily reunited with Brion. In the season finale, however, Violet is horrified when she witnesses Brion murder his uncle, thereby betraying everyone. When Brion wishes for Violet to become his queen, she refuses and is left heartbroken by his actions, but is comforted by Artemis and Tara. Her known-abilities are: *Violet: Healing, which can be used on both herself and others, and passive self-resurrection; *Indigo: Boom-tube generation; *Blue: A blindingly bright flash; *Green: Holograms; *Yellow: Concussive energy blasts that can also slice through objects if fired in a cutting motion; *Orange: Flight; *Red: Force field generation; *Rainbow: All available powers plus anti-life equation healing. Film An evil version of Halo, known as Aurora, appears as a member of the Crime Syndicate of America in the animated film Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths. Aurora appears in the first fight with the Justice League and she is defeated by Green Lantern. Her powers were similar to a Green Lantern's, except that she does not wield a ring and her energy is pink.

Bodywork techniques also aim to assess or improve posture, promote awareness of the \\"bodymind connection\\" which is an approach that sees the human body and mind as a single integrated unit, or to manipulate the electromagnetic field alleged to surround the human body and affect health.  Forms  Some of the best known forms of non-touch bodywork methods include: reiki, yoga, pranayama, as well as other non-touch methods: breathwork respiration techniques, therapeutic touch, the Bates method for sight training, qigong, and t'ai chi. The better known forms of manipulative bodywork include the Bowen technique, chiropractic, reflexology, Rolfing, postural integration, shiatsu, and the Trager approach. There are also some methods that use light touch (not tissue work) to retrain movement patterns or shift awareness of the body, including the Alexander technique, the Feldenkrais method, the Hakomi method, integrative body psychotherapy, craniosacral therapy, and somatic experiencing.

The series ran from September 13, 1986, to October 5, 1991, and was produced by Columbia Pictures Television, DIC Enterprises and Coca-Cola Telecommunications. The series continues the adventures of paranormal investigators Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler, Dr. Ray Stantz, Winston Zeddemore, their secretary Janine Melnitz and their mascot ghost Slimer. \\"The Real\\" was added to the title after a dispute with Filmation and its Ghost Busters properties. There also were two ongoing Real Ghostbusters comics, one published monthly by Now Comics in the United States and the other published weekly (originally biweekly) by Marvel Comics in the United Kingdom. Kenner produced a line of action figures and playsets based on the cartoon. Plot The series follows the continuing adventures of the four Ghostbusters, their secretary Janine, their accountant Louis, and their mascot Slimer, as they chase and capture rogue spirits around New York City and various other areas of the world. Slimer! At the start of the fourth season in 1988, the show was retitled to Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters. It aired in a one-hour time slot, which the show had begun doing under its original name earlier that same year on January 30, 1988. In addition to the regular thirty-minute Real Ghostbusters episode, a half-hour Slimer sub-series was added that included 2‚Äì3 short animated segments focusing on the character Slimer. Animation for the Slimer! cartoons was handled by Wang Film Productions. At the end of its seven-season run, 147 episodes had aired, including the syndicated episodes and 13 episodes of Slimer, with multiple episodes airing out of production order. Slimer is shown to haunt the Sedgewick Hotel as its recurring pest. The segments added several characters as friends of Slimer and other supporting characters like a singing ice-cream truck driver named Chilly Cooper, an Italian pizza chef named Luigi, a restaurant owner named Rafael who is Luigi's boss, a bellhop named Bud, hotel manager Morris Grout, socialite Mrs. Van Huego and her dog Fred, odd-job worker Rudy. Slimer had an antagonist named Professor Norman Dweeb, an archetypical mad scientist usually accompanied by a sidekick pink poodle named Elizabeth. Dweeb wants to capture Slimer to experiment on him and to gain personal glory. Dweeb also made three appearances in the main series, one a clip show from the last two seasons. Other enemies of Slimer include an alley cat named Manx, a dog named Bruiser, a tough woman named Mrs. Stone, and the ghost gangsters Goolem and Zugg as well as their boss Scareface. One of the ghosts from the Slimer cartoons, the Sleaze, also reappeared in The Real Ghostbusters to be captured a second time.

A short pilot episode was produced, but never aired in full. The full four-minute promo was released on Time Life's DVD set in 2008. Scenes of the pilot can be seen in TV promos that aired prior to the beginning of the series. Among differences seen in the promo pilot, the Ghostbusters wore beige jumpsuits as in the film and the character design for Peter Venkman bore more of a resemblance to actor Bill Murray. The character designs by Jim McDermott were dramatically different, with color-coded jumpsuits for each character. When he auditioned for the voice of Egon Spengler, Maurice LaMarche noted that while he was asked not to impersonate Harold Ramis, he did so anyway and eventually got the part. LaMarche also noted that Bill Murray had remarked off-handedly to producers that Lorenzo Music's voice of Peter Venkman sounded more like Garfield (who was also voiced by Music at the time). Bill Murray went on to voice Garfield in Garfield: The Movie and its sequel after Music died. A different explanation for the change of actor for Peter Venkman came from Dave Coulier, who took over the role of Venkman from Music, who explained that Joe Medjuck, a producer on both the original 1984 film and the animated series, wanted the character to sound more like Bill Murray. Ernie Hudson was the only actor from the films who auditioned to play his character in the series; however, the role was given to Arsenio Hall and later Buster Jones. Although the Ghostbusters concept was tinkered with, the finalized show does feature many tie-ins from the films. In the season 1 episode \\"Take Two\\", the Ghostbusters fly to Hollywood to visit the set of a movie based on their adventures, which is revealed to be the 1984 movie at the end of the episode. The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man makes numerous appearances. During the third season, Walter Peck, the Environmental Protection Agency antagonist from the original film, reappears. The uniforms and containment unit are redesigned, and Slimer is changed from a bad ghost to a resident and friend, events which are explained in the episode \\"Citizen Ghost\\" that flashes back to what happened to the Ghostbusters right after the movie's events. Gozer is mentioned repeatedly throughout the series, usually in comparison to a ghost they are currently battling (e.g. \\"Cthulhu makes Gozer look like Little Mary Sunshine\\"). In the third season, some of the character designs were modified. Ray's character design was slimmed down to give the character a less overweight appearance and Slimer was given a tail instead of the formerly rounded bottom (he reverted to a stub in season 6). The biggest change was to the character of Janine, whose hair was completely changed from being short and spiky to long and straight. Her overall design was softened, as was her personality. Her voice was also softened with Kath Soucie taking over the voice role from Laura Summer. ABC also went back, and redubbed Peter's and Janine's dialogue in several episodes of the show with Dave Coulier and Kath Soucie, respectively. Changes to Janine's character were eventually addressed in the season 6 episode (#118) entitled, \\"Janine, You've Changed\\". At the start of the series' fourth season in 1988, the opening was completely redone to center around Slimer. Eventually the episodes were expanded from their original half-hour format to last an hour, and the overall feel of the show was changed to be more youthful, with episodes having a lighter tone to be less frightening. J. Michael Straczynski was a story editor on the series, and wrote episodes for every season except four and seven. By season 5, Louis Tully was added to the show in order to follow Ghostbusters II. Voice acting and animation Recording for the show took place in Los Angeles, California. The cast always recorded together, instead of separately.Time- Life's The Real Ghostbusters complete collection DVD set special features After recording of the dialogue was completed, sound tapes, storyboards, backgrounds, and character designs were then shipped to DiC Founder; Jean Chalopin's Japanese studio; KK DiC (1986) / KK C&D; (1987 onwards) and similar studios in Tokyo, Japan, such as TMS Entertainment and Toei Animation among others (South Korean studios during the final two seasons) for animation and filming. Broadcast The show originally aired on ABC for its full run, except for the second season, which ran in syndication at the same time as the third season ran on ABC. Later, reruns of the show appeared on the USA Network's USA Cartoon Express from September 16, 1991TV Guide ‚Äì September 14‚Äì20, 1991 to September 11, 1994.Tyrone Daily Herald's TV Week ‚Äì September 9‚Äì16, 1994 Fox Family Channel also reran the series from August 17, 1998TV Guide ‚Äì August 15‚Äì21, 1998 to October 1, 1999.TV Guide ‚Äì September 25 ‚Äì October 1, 1999 In August 2012, reruns began airing on Fearnet during the weekends, part of their \\"Funhouse\\" block, and on April 1, 2017 the show began to stream on Netflix, but was removed 2 years later. Media The Real Ghostbusters Soundtrack was released in 1986 on CD, records, and cassette by Polygram Records. All songs were performed by Tahiti (Tyren Perry & Tonya Townsend.) From 1986 to 1989, several episodes were released by Magic Window, the children's imprint of RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video. The episodes on the cassettes were from the first season of syndication. In 2004 and again in 2006, Sony released bare bones episode compilations in the United Kingdom and United States, respectively. The DVD release of Ghostbusters II also included two episodes of the series as bonus features, \\"Citizen Ghost\\", a story focusing on events set immediately after the first movie, and \\"Partners in Slime\\" (this episode has the original broadcast version and the original end logos‚ÄîDiC \\"Kid In Bed\\" and Columbia Pictures Television (1988) logos, respectively), which featured the psycho-active slime from Ghostbusters II and a brief mention of its villain Vigo the Carpathian. On May 27, 2008, Time Life announced they had acquired the home video rights to the series and would release a complete series set on DVD in the Fall of 2008. That July they allowed fans the chance to vote between two variations of an outer box for the set‚Äîone designed to look like the main characters' firehouse headquarters and the other all black with different images on each side. Both featured lenticular printing, the firehouse version to show the Ecto-1 and the black version to have oozing \\"slime\\". Released on November 25, 2008, in the \\"firehouse\\" casing, the set spans 25 discs containing all 147 episodes of the series. They subsequently began releasing the individual volumes on March 31, 2009; however, only the first 3 were released. Volumes 4 and 5 were not released due to poor sales. The Time Life releases have been discontinued and are now out of print. On May 5, 2016, it was announced that Sony would begin re-releasing the series on DVD in Region 1. Volumes 1‚Äì5 (each containing 11 or 12 episodes) were released on July 5, 2016. Volumes 6‚Äì10 (with 10 or 11 episodes each) were released on September 6, 2016. Unlike the previous Time Life edition, the Sony release did not contain the complete series, as 29 episodes were omitted, as well as the entire Slimer sub-series. Additionally, title cards were removed from all episodes in the first 5 volumes (title and writer credits were superimposed over the animated opening). On October 3, 2017, all 10 volumes, spanning 10 discs containing 111 episodes, were released in a single plastic box set. The complete first season was released on DVD in Australia on June 3, 2009, and in the UK on June 15, 2009. Spin-offs: Extreme Ghostbusters In 1997, a sequel cartoon entitled Extreme Ghostbusters, was created by Columbia TriStar Television and Adelaide Productions. It premiered on September 1, 1997 and ran for forty episodes until its conclusion on December 8, 1997. Set several years after the end of The Real Ghostbusters, the series opened by saying the team has disbanded due to a lack of supernatural activity. Only Egon remains in the firehouse, along with Slimer, to care for the containment system while teaching classes at a local university. When supernatural events begin occurring in New York, Egon recruits four of his university students as a new team of Ghostbusters, and Janine, also one of Egon's students, returns to manage the office. The original Ghostbusters return for the two-episode season finale to celebrate Egon's 40th birthday, leading to them reluctantly working together with the younger generation to solve one last case.

It is a part of the Ghostbusters franchise. The series originally aired on the Syndicated BKN block in 1997, and features a team of younger college-level Ghostbusters who are led by veteran Ghostbuster Egon Spengler. In some TV listings, the show was called Ghostbusters Dark.The Complete SFX Guide to Ghostbusters (2014), \\"Extreme Makeover\\" (pg 190) Plot Set years after the end of The Real Ghostbusters, lack of supernatural activity has put the Ghostbusters out of business. Each member has gone their separate way, except for Dr. Egon Spengler, who still lives in the firehouse to monitor the containment unit, take care of Slimer, further his studies and teach a class on the paranormal at a local college. When ghosts start to reappear, Egon is forced to recruit his lone four students as the new Ghostbusters. These are Kylie Griffin, a goth girl genius and expert on the occult; Eduardo Rivera, a cynical Latino slacker; Garrett Miller, a young white paraplegic athlete who uses a wheelchair; and Roland Jackson, a studious African-American machinery whiz. Filling the cast are Janine Melnitz, the Ghostbusters' previous secretary who returns to the job, and Slimer, a hungry ghost. The series follows the adventures of this \\"Next Generation\\" of Ghostbusters tracking down and capturing ghosts all over New York and occasionally beyond the city. The series is styled as a supernatural comedy, following the trend set by its predecessor, but given an updated and darker feel. This is reflected by the use of a gritty, rock/punk-inspired variation of Ray Parker Jr.'s song \\"Ghostbusters\\" as the opening theme, written by Jim Latham and performed by voice actor Jim Cummings. Recurring themes throughout the series are the new team learning to work together despite their differences, Janine's largely unrequited affection for Egon, the love-hate relationship between Kylie and Eduardo that is never resolved, and the Ghostbusters' frequent clashes with authority figures who disbelieve their work. Characters From left to right in front: Garrett Miller, Slimer, Kylie Griffin, Eduardo Rivera, and Roland Jackson. *Slimer (voiced by Billy West) ‚Äì Slimer remains the most unchanged of all the characters in terms of personality. However, he is given a less cartoony look to fit in with the series' overall style. In \\"Fear Itself\\", it's revealed that Slimer is afraid of broccoli (which is ironic, as he has been shown to eat anything). Slimer is very well-meaning, but is often pushed around by the Ghostbusters as he gets in their way and eats continually. His actions often affect the story, usually adversely, though he often acts to fix his mistakes and on a number of occasions has been shown to have a heroic nature and that he can wield a proton pack.Extreme Ghostbusters episode 19 Bird of Prey\\" He's got a strong rivalry with Eduardo, similar to the one he had with Peter Venkman, though several episodes show that Eduardo ‚Äì and the other Ghostbusters ‚Äì do care for him as much as he annoys them.Extreme Ghostbusters episode 23 Slimer's Sacrifice He's been living with Egon for over a decade now, and the two are closer than in the original series; when trying to get Egon to discipline the ghost in \\"Glutton for Punishment\\", Janine says she knows the two have been through a lot together, and in \\"Slimer's Sacrifice\\" Egon immediately suits up to enter the Containment Unit to rescue him, but after he is attacked by the ghost, Eduardo goes in to save Slimer. * (voiced by Rino Romano) ‚Äì Seemingly a lazy, sarcastic and somewhat clueless character, Eduardo nevertheless makes himself an integral part of the team by being determined and reliable. Eduardo, along with Garrett, resembles original Ghostbuster Peter Venkman in that, like Venkman, Eduardo is sarcastic, has a penchant for pursuing attractive women, and is generally unscientific and constantly spouts pop culture references. He also reads \\"J.N. Kline\\" young-adult horror novels. Eduardo has a long-running subplot dealing with a love/hate relationship between him and Kylie, although it is very much revealed \\"In Your Dreams\\" that he has intimate feelings and dreams about her. These feelings are further enforced in that he is usually the one to rescue Kylie from dangerous situations, and vice versa, in several episodes. He once said to Kylie herself that nothing was going to happen to her \\"while [he's] around\\". In fact, in the episode \\"Darkness at Noon\\" he outright admitted to Kylie, who was possessed by a ghost at the time, that he felt an attraction of sorts when he saw her for the first time and even showed the intention of kissing her when Kylie asked him to. In \\"The Unseen\\" he takes the rap for Kylie's mistake, not wanting \\"the worst day of her life to get any worse\\". In \\"Rage\\", Eduardo reveals to have an older brother, Carlos \\"Carl\\" Rivera, an NYPD officer who is angry with Eduardo for not being a police officer like the rest of their family, and thinks the Ghostbuster are a scam, which is why Eduardo kept his job a secret. In the same episode it is also implied that his father is dead (or at least retired) as he and Carlos refer to him in the past tense during a heated argument. In \\"Fear Itself\\", it's revealed that Eduardo has a fear of death (specifically his own). He has a vicious rivalry with Slimer, but has ended up working with the ghost, and volunteered to save him in \\"Slimer's Sacrifice\\". He also has an on the surface rivalry with Garrett with the two often mocking each other and attempting to one up the other. In spite of this as the series goes on the two seem to have the closest thing to a friendship even though Garrett's enthusiastic personality completely contrasts Eduardo's cynical attitude. (The official website claimed he slacks off due to fear of failure.) Despite all his cynicism and slacking he demonstrates a reasonably high level of intelligence as in the episode \\"Eyes of a Dragon\\" he states how the proton aspect of light works to Kylie and later on how to defeat the ghost of that episode. Eduardo was also the one to smash a cursed orb, causing the eye- stealing ghost to disintegrate in the episode \\"The Unseen\\" and also continued the incantation that destroyed the demon of an alternate dimension in which he, Roland and Kylie were imprisoned in the episode \\"Casting the Runes\\". Eduardo has also exhibited bouts of jealousy whenever Kylie seemingly flirts with other men and in \\"Till Death Do Us Start\\" he showed signs of sheepish nervousness when asked if he and Kylie were together. * (voiced by Tara Charendoff) ‚Äì The only member of the new team to have any sort of paranormal knowledge (much like Egon) before signing up as a Ghostbuster, after her friend Jack was a victim of the Grundel. Kylie is in awe of Egon when the series began, but this soon shifts to a more equal footing, and becomes somewhat of the unofficial leader in the field, after Egon. Kylie's calm exterior often sets her as a foil against Eduardo's brashness, as part of the ongoing love/hate dynamic between the two. Although she has never admitted it, she often seemed to appreciate Eduardo's feeling towards her, such as giving a thankful smile on the occasions when he saves her life and vice versa. She is also the one who most commonly wields the Ghost Traps. She is depicted as something of a \\"Goth\\" girl, judging by the black hair and lipstick. In the episode \\"Grease\\", it is revealed that her parents divorced and she currently lives alone with her cat; she was highly close to her grandmother Rose, who died a year before the show started, and both her interest in the paranormal and Gothic styling are implied to be related to her grandmother's death. In \\"Fear Itself\\", it's revealed that Kylie is afraid of maggots as she finds them creepy, and in \\"Heart of Darkness\\" it is revealed she used to be \\"Cheerleader of the Year\\" when she was in the 8th Grade of her junior high school (something she finds mortifying). There is a running gag where she often replies with the sentence, \\"I'm not a...\\", followed by what has happened. It is also hinted throughout the series that she's attracted to older, intelligent men. Kylie Griffin also appears in the Ghostbusters comic books published by IDW Publishing. In the comics, she originally only appeared in cameo roles as a worker in Ray Stantz's occult book shop before being made a Ghostbuster in issues starting in 2013. * (voiced by Alfonso Ribeiro) ‚Äì The mechanic of the group. Roland is the most level-headed and mechanically-gifted of the new Ghostbusters, helping Egon repair and improve the Proton Packs and Ecto-1; his reason for joining Egon's class was seeing the Ecto-1 at an auto show. Roland approaches the paranormal from a practical point-of-view, and in the episode \\"Fear Itself\\" reveals that his only fear is the dangerous breakdown of his equipment. In \\"The Infernal Machine\\", he became disgruntled that his technological efforts were being taken for granted. Roland's strongest wish is to get into the Ivy League and become a doctor. He's a very staid, square personality, slow to anger, though he came close to striking one of the racists in \\"The True Face of the Monster\\"; it's implied he's had to deal with racist attitudes before. Roland has twice come under the mental control of villains, the Siren in \\"Sonic Youth\\" and Luko in \\"The Infernal Machine\\". \\"Grease\\" reveals Roland is the oldest in a lower-middle-class family and volunteers for the Little League and helps the homeless; in \\"Grundelesque\\" we meet his very mischievous younger brother whom Roland (at first) refuses to believe is a troublemaker. Like Winston, Roland is the only African American member of the team, yet he has a talent with machines like Ray. * (voiced by Jason Marsden) ‚Äì Despite being paraplegic, Garret has a very 'jock'-like attitude and is a huge fan of extreme sports and attempting mad stunts. In the episode \\"Grease\\", it's revealed that Garrett was born with the inability to walk, and throughout the series he only refers to his condition to mock it (and in \\"Be Careful What You Wish For\\", uses it as an excuse to dump some work on Eduardo). He also once used it to convince two FBI agents to uncuff him, feigning helplessness. He is the most headstrong and enthusiastic of the new Ghostbusters, often claiming that he's in it only for the adrenaline rush; he was left bitterly disappointed in \\"Ghost Apocalyptic Future\\" to learn he was the only Ghostbuster not remembered in the future dystopia. While he studies to be a physical therapist to help other disabled people, his secret dream is to be an NBA star. In \\"Fear Itself\\", it's revealed that Garrett is claustrophobic (though he never admits it to anyone), and has a deep disdain towards people who assume disabled people are helpless. He has a rivalry with Eduardo, the two of them constantly bantering and trying to one-up each other. In \\"Deadliners\\", we find out Garrett wrote a (bad) horror story starring himself (the other Ghostbusters died on the first page, to their annoyance). Like Ray, Garrett is the most enthusiastic. Garrett is the only Ghostbuster in the history of the franchise never to be made as a toy (all other Ghostbusters received at least two toys, including Louis and Janine), presumably due to the implausibility of assembling a miniature wheelchair on a production line. Though a prototype figure was made. Bob Higgins has said that during a focus group of young children, the creators found Garrett was the most popular character: \\"when we asked... which of these characters would you want to be and they all wanted to be Garrett, they all wanted to be the guy that does the crazy things. They all wanted to be the guy that was the leader and they all kind of saw him as the leader of this group [even though he wasn't]\\". *Egon Spengler (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) ‚Äì The only original Ghostbuster to become a regular in this spin-off series, Egon takes on the role of mentor for the new team of Ghostbusters. He still lives in the fire house with Slimer, enabling the building to become the Ghostbusters headquarters when paranormal activity starts again. Before the first ghost escaped, Egon was teaching classes on the paranormal at New York City College ‚Äì four people taking his class was double the usual. He usually leaves the field work to the new members, opting to provide audio back-up from the fire house and information on their current adversary, but has joined them in action when he feels the crisis requires his presence. Other than ghosts, he also has an interest in mold and started to grow cultures in Eduardo's bathtub when the two roomed together. He continues to have romantic tension with Janine. The official website listed his age at 41 though in \\"The Sphinx\\", while suffering a bit of a mid-life crisis, he said he was 39. *Janine Melnitz (voiced by Pat Musick) ‚Äì The Ghostbusters' original receptionist returns to the role after she is reunited with Egon by taking his Paranormal 101 class at New York City College. Like Egon, she watches over the new team, and on occasion contributes an active part in ghostbusting. According to Egon, she also functions as the team's accountant and collector. She also shows off obvious signs of attraction to Egon, but he is completely oblivious to this, which only frustrates her. The official website said \\"she's spent the last decade flitting from job to job... trying not to pine for Prof. Spengler\\". Production Showrunner Bob Higgins told Ability Magazine that the decision to create a new Ghostbusters was taken by the studio, which hoped to reinvigorate a lucrative franchise. Originally announced as Super Ghostbusters in 1996, the initial press release had Janine, teaching history at a local college, bringing together a new team with \\"a hip new attitude\\" to face a new plague of ghosts; \\"short on time and more than a little desperate, Janine turns to four of her teenaged students\\". (Egon would be \\"huddled in front of a computer screen, battling program bugs instead of spooks\\".) The show's creators decided \\"what we wanted to do was really put together a team of misfits in a way, people that you would not necessarily associate with being superheroes on television\\": hence Eduardo as a slacker, Roland as a \\"square\\", and Kylie as moody and sarcastic, with Garrett as the balance, \\"an adrenaline junkie... who could kind of kick start the team\\". Fil Barlow, the designer, was given rough outlines and originally designed all the characters bar Eduardo as girls (Garrett as Lucy and Roland as Julia), with Egon originally designed as bearded and robed. This aspect would be dropped.The Complete SFX Guide to Ghostbusters (2014), \\"Extreme Makeover\\" (pg 119)Barlow's DeviantArt section: XGB: Early Concept ~ Female Characters, XGB: Early Concept ~ Julia (Barlow pitched \\"Egon as an ambassador to the ghost realm trying to stop an impending war on the other side\\".) During production, Lucy/Garrett was found to be quite bland and annoying until producer Jeff Kline suggested putting the character in a wheelchair; Higgins stated this made Garrett more interesting to write, as he was now \\"one of these guys that takes what he is given and makes the best of it and really lives up to any potential that he has\\". When designed as Lucy, she was given proton-blasting callipers and crutches but producer Richard Raynis requested the wheelchair instead. (Barlow attempted to show a female character could \\"be fearless and gung ho\\" but Raynis requested the gender change) The show ended up winning an award from the Los Angeles Commission on Disabilities for its work on Garrett. Various elements would be changed before airing: Egon would replace Janine as the teacher, Slimer lost a goblin sidekick called Gnat, and Garrett was originally \\"Lucas\\". Roland was originally a clumsy \\"gentle giant\\", Eduardo had a dream of running in the Olympics, and Lucas had a hair-trigger temper. (Some of these still made it to the character profiles on the EGB website) The team that helmed Extreme Ghostbusters consisted of many producers and writers that had done work on The Real Ghostbusters, including Richard Raynis. As a result, the show was made as an explicit sequel to Real. This made the show one of the few direct sequels to a 1980s cartoon series ‚Äî other franchises, such as Masters of the Universe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, opted for series relaunches ‚Äî and as such opted for a more realistic passage of time. Maurice LaMarche was brought back to play Egon Spengler ‚Äî though Frank Welker and Laura Summer did not return to play Slimer and Janine, respectively. The series would start to have more explicit tie-ins to Real as it went on ‚Äî \\"Slimer's Sacrifice\\" referenced Egon entering the Containment Unit in an episode of Real Ghostbusters: Xmas Marks the Spot; \\"Grundelesque,\\" was a direct sequel to Real Ghostbusters episode \\"The Grundel\\", bringing back the eponymous villain and revealing Kylie lost a friend during its first attack. Finally and notably was the two-part finale \\"Back in the Saddle\\", which featured the remaining original Ghostbusters returning and teaming up with their successors ‚Äî with Dave Coulier (the second voice of Peter Venkman), Buster Jones (the second voice of Winston Zeddemore), and Frank Welker (the voice of Ray Stantz) all reprising their roles.

There is currently no plan to release the series on DVD in the United States. The first series was re-released in the UK on the 27th of June 2016, once again featuring the first 13 episodes. Video games Three video games based on the series were also created, Extreme Ghostbusters for the Game Boy Color, Extreme Ghostbusters: Code Ecto-1 for Game Boy Advance and Extreme Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Invasion for the PlayStation. There are also two PC games: Extreme Ghostbusters: Zap The Ghosts! and Extreme Ghostbusters Creativity Centre. Broadcast history The series originally aired on the Syndicated BKN block in 1997. The show first aired in the Republic of Ireland on RTE Two from 19 February 1998 to 1999. Years later, a short rerun was shown on the same channel in the summer of 2007. Website The original website (still available online) contained a Flash tour of the Firehouse, character profiles, descriptions of the ghosts fought, and a Flash game. Some of the character details in the profiles had never made it into an episode. The \\"Spengler's Spirit Guide\\" section contained journal entries by \\"Egon\\" himself, about haunted areas and the how-to of ghostbusting. Two of the entries, The Bermuda Triangle and The Jersey Devil, were topics that showed up in episodes. Reception and legacy In a retrospective of the show, SFX referred to the \\"consensus that any extension of the Ghostbusters brand requires a whole new team of newbies to take on the mantle\\" and that Extreme Ghostbusters was the first time it was put into practice. The failure of the show, blamed by the showrunners on poor US scheduling and the decline of non-educational children's syndication in favor of carriage on networks such as Fox Kids and Kids' WB and cable channels (\\"broadcast mid-morning in a slot only suitable for pre-schools,\\" though some American stations still did carry the show between 3:00pm and 5:00pm in the afterschool period), was seen by SFX as showing \\"the appeal of Ghostbusters was only partially the concept... that it's the characters we love above all must be a sobering thought for anyone charged with rebooting Ghostbusters again.\\" The show was also noted for being aimed at \\"a slightly more adolescent audience with a tougher edge\\", \\"clearly intended to test the boundaries of child-friendly horror\\" and the Eduardo/Kylie relationship pushed the edges of the ratings.The Complete SFX Guide to Ghostbusters (2014), \\"Extreme Makeover\\" (pg 118‚Äì22) The character of Kylie Griffin appeared in the IDW comics in the 2010s.

Alberg's business failed after about three years, but Alstr√∂m became a shipbroker on his own, and did very well. Eventually he desired to establish industry back home, and in 1724 established a woolen factory in his native village, which became profitable after some initial difficulties. He then established a sugar refinery in Gothenburg, encouraged improvements in potato cultivation, tanning, cutlery, and shipbuilding. His greatest success came with the introduction of sheep. Although Alstr√∂mer was pivotal in popularizing the cultivation of potatoes, the popular idea that he was responsible for introducing the potato in Sweden is a myth, as potatoes were grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden (in what is now the Linnaean Garden) by Olaus Rudbeck in 1658, before Alstr√∂mer was even born. Nevertheless, Alstr√∂mer himself maintained that he had brought the potato to Sweden, and his name has remained closely associated with potatoes. He was one of the six persons who founded the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1739. The King made him a knight of the Order of the Polar Star in 1748, and soon after with letters of nobility, changing his name to Alstr√∂mer.

The manga was serialized in Shogakukan's Big Comic Spirits magazine and the chapters collected into 7 tank≈çbon volumes. It has been licensed and distributed by Viz Media in North America. It is also distributed in the United Kingdom by Manga Entertainment (as \\"She, the Ultimate Weapon\\"). An anime television series adaptation animated by Gonzo aired from July to September 2002 and a side-story OVA series animated by Studio Fantasia was released in 2005. The anime television series was also licensed by Viz, but is now licensed by Sentai Filmworks. A live-action movie adaptation was released in Japan on January 28, 2006 with Aki Maeda starring as Chise. Plot The story begins with , a high school student in a Hokkaid≈ç coastal city, walking up to an observatory and reminiscing about his girlfriend, ; there he finds her exchange diaries that she purposefully left behind. The ensuing story is narrated by Shuji through flashbacks while reading Chise's diary. Chise, a fellow student in his class, declares her love for Shuji at the beginning of the series. However, Chise is very shy and Shuji is insensitive: neither know how to express their feelings very well, but they do indeed have feelings for each other. One day, while Shuji is shopping in Sapporo, unknown bombers attack the city in broad daylight. He and his friends run for cover, but notice a fast and small flying object shooting down the enemy bombers. Separated from his friends, Shuji wanders through the wreckage‚Äîonly to stumble upon Chise; here she has metal wings and weapons‚Äîapparently grafted onto her body. She tells him she has become the ultimate weapon, without her knowledge or consent, and that she is seen by the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) as the last hope for defending Japan. In the anime, it is not apparent why Chise was chosen to be the ultimate weapon or why the country is under attack. It was not until the OVA episodes were released that an explanation for Chise being chosen was offered: her body has the highest degree of compatibility with the weapon system. This story focuses primarily on Chise's fading humanity as her condition worsens. The main conflict is within Chise herself; she questions whether or not she is human. Her soul is constantly trying to be a normal girl, while her body succumbs to the devastating effects of the weapon cell within her. Fundamentally important to the plot is the relationship between Shuji and Chise. From this, the resolution of the conflict follows. In the end, she is able to realize who she truly is. A number of minor characters who do not necessarily know of Chise's role in the war have sub-plots that concern everyday people in the context of war: a woman whose husband is constantly away from home, a school boy who joins the army to protect his girlfriend, a girl whose civilian boyfriend is killed in a bombing, and others. Characters Main characters ; : :Played by: Aki Maeda :She is the main female character of the story. Chise is a shy, clumsy girl with very little self-esteem and has poor grades in everything except for World History. She was constantly hospitalized in Tokyo during her elementary years, and thus, has very few friends (except for Akemi). She starts dating Shuji, with Akemi‚Äôs help, and tries to make her relationship work with him despite his apparently aloof personality. However, Chise is very inexperienced and does not know much about relationships to the point she reads sh≈çjo manga for advice. She was turned into the ultimate weapon against her will and the series revolves around her and her fading humanity. As Chise‚Äôs weapon-side starts to take over, her heart stops beating, her body lacks warmth and her sense of taste and touch are dulled, but other senses (especially sight) are accentuated. Her condition worsens and her humanity seems to fade away entirely. In the final episodes of the anime, she appears to be nothing more than a cold, ruthless machine that delights in her growing, destructive powers and killing people without mercy. Her love for Shuji is the last of her humanity. Throughout the story, she tries to come to terms with her body while still trying to convince herself that she is still human. She believes that she is nothing more than a weapon designed to kill. Her boyfriend Shuji, however, is able to help her break free by showing her that she is able to protect the ones she loves, and that only a human can experience the feeling of love. This helps Chise destroy the body in which she was trapped, and she realizes that she is indeed human. This brings to question what is meant by the term \\"ultimate weapon\\" used throughout the story. Chise's soul had been the only thing that was able to destroy her body, which was claimed to be the most powerful thing in the world. ; : :Played by: Shunsuke Kubozuka :He is the main male character of the story and narrator of the series. He is a somewhat antisocial 17-year-old high school student who gets higher than average grades and used to be on his school‚Äôs track team. Shuuji is very unsure of his initial feelings for Chise and feels that their relationship is more trouble than its worth, though his feelings deepen as the story progresses. Not long after the two became much closer, they decided to simply become friends again and leave their closer relationship alone. This gives him time to realize his love for Chise and he eventually wishes to give the relationship another try. However, things get complicated when his first love, Fuyumi, reappears in town. He is the only civilian who knows Chise is the ultimate weapon and promises that he will never divulge her secret. Shuuji is feeling constantly guilty and useless because his irresponsible actions tend to hurt Chise. Later on in the series, he comes to accept his love for Chise and vows to protect her and be by her side at all costs. ; : :Played by: Shihori Kanjiya :She is a childhood friend and classmate of both Chise and Shuji. Akemi is also Chise's best friend, and usually gives her advice on love. A typical tomboy, but she has some insecurities about her appearance, always questioning why any man would fall for her. She always comes to Chise‚Äôs defense whenever Shuji inadvertently hurts Chise verbally. ; : :Played by: Ryo Kimura :Shuji‚Äôs best friend. Atsushi is a mature, open, down-to-earth guy who holds a fascination for the military. He decides to join the JSDF to protect the girl he loves. ; : :Played by: Kiyohiko Shibukawa :Regiment leader, Fuyumi‚Äôs husband, and the sole survivor of Chise‚Äôs first platoon. He‚Äôs very much like Shuji in terms of looks and personality and that‚Äôs why Chise is initially attracted to him. He treats Chise like an ordinary girl, which is why Chise likes him. He's one of the characters to be featured in the OVA, where Mizuki, his former commander, was shown to have a crush on him. ; : :Played by: Miki Sakai :Tetsu‚Äôs wife. She used to train the track team when she was younger and her students called her ‚ÄúFuyumi-senpai‚Äù because of the close age difference. She is always feeling lonely as her husband, Tetsu, is never home since he‚Äôs always away in the army. It is soon revealed that Shuji and Fuyumi were once in love. Shuji explains that his love for her was never true; he simply wanted to become physically closer to her. ; : :Seen only in the OVA, Mizuki was the prototype for the weapon system which would later be used on Chise. She was an officer who was badly wounded in an attack, but returned to the battlefield because of the prototype weapon system. She also had a crush on Tetsu, her former deputy. She was one of the very few people sympathetic (and empathetic since she, too, was a weapon) towards Chise. Minor characters ;Take : :The most extroverted guy in Shuji‚Äôs circle of friends and Yukari's boyfriend. Take is the first one to get a girlfriend in Shuji's group. His girlfriend is named Yukari. ;Nori : :The most immature guy in Shuji‚Äôs circle of friends. Nori is a naive high-school student, who believed that the war would never reach their hometown and they should stop worrying about it. He desperately wants to have a girlfriend, and is slightly jealous of Take for having one. ;Yukari : :Take‚Äôs girlfriend. After her boyfriend‚Äôs death, she leaves the school. Soon after that, she gets another boyfriend and on the surface, claims she will never love anyone seriously again. ;Takamura : :Young soldier on Chise‚Äôs former company.

It has also been translated into Spanish by Gl√©nat, into Italian by Panini Comics, into German by Carlsen Verlag and into French by √âditions Delcourt. One-shots ;Love Story, Killed The story is of a 17-year-old Japanese sniper, who hides in the remains of a block of flats and kills enemy soldiers so that he can collect their guns (sans ammunition, just to lay them out on the floor). At the start of the story, he kills a group of enemy soldiers who are about to rape a Japanese girl. While collecting their guns, the sniper is confronted by the girl who picked up one of the guns, but the sniper eventually befriends the girl and takes her back to his room because he wants to have sex with her. It is revealed that he only has five rounds left, with his final round being his good luck charm that he keeps in the pocket, and that he wants to die because it will relieve him from the war. However, after getting to know the girl better and having sex with her, he becomes afraid of death, and when firing on an enemy squadron that came looking for him, he misses and reveals his position. Eventually, he finds himself unable to fire his good luck charm round due to his fear of death. Suddenly the girl appears in the doorway, bringing the guns and ammo of the soldiers he has just killed, saying that he now has the ammunition to kill more soldiers and can keep fighting in the war. Right as the sniper smiles however, three enemy soldiers appear behind the girl, kill the sniper and then rape and kill the girl. The enemy soldiers themselves all die two days later. ; The Last Love Song on This Little Planet A series by Shin Takahashi which is a collection of OneShots called \\"The Last Love Song On This Little Planet\\".

The Hispanic Marches or Spanish Marches (, , Aragonese and , , ), also known as the March of Barcelona, were a military buffer zone beyond the former province of Septimania, established by Charlemagne in 795 as a defensive barrier between the Umayyad Moors of Al- Andalus and the Frankish Carolingian Empire (Duchy of Gascony, the Duchy of Aquitaine and Carolingian Septimania). In its broader meaning, Hispanic Marches sometimes refers to a group of early Iberian and trans-Pyrenean lordships or counts coming under Frankish rule. As time passed, these lordships merged or gained independence from Frankish imperial rule.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262828943_Carolingian_Catalonia_The_Spanish_March_and_the_Franks_c750-c1050 Geographical context The area broadly corresponds to the eastern regions between the Pyrenees and the Ebro River. The local population of the March was diverse. It included Basques in its north-western valleys, JewsOn the Role of the Jews in the Establishment of the Hispanic Marches (768-814) : STUDIES IN THE HISTORY, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF. / Bachrach, Bernard S., and a large Occitano-Romance-speaking Hispano-Roman population (Occitans and Catalans) governed by the Visigothic Code, all of them under the influence of Al-Andalus culture, since their lords had vowed allegiance to Cordoban rulers until Pepin's conquest of Andalusian Septimania (759). The Pyrenean valleys started to switch loyalties after 785 (Girona, Ribagorza, etc.) with the construction and garrisoning by counts loyal to the Carolingians of new outposts and fortresses on bordering areas. The territory changed with the fortunes of the Empires and the feudal ambitions of those, whether the counts or walis, appointed to administer the counties. Eventually the rulers and people of the March became autonomous and claimed independence. Out of the welter of counties in the region emerged the Principality of Catalonia composed by a myriad of counties with the County of Barcelona as their main power centre. Counties that at various times formed part of the March included: Ribagorza (initially including Pallars), Urgell, Cerdanya, Perelada, Emp√∫ries, Besal√∫, Ausona (Osona), Barcelona, Girona (March of Hispania) and, Conflent, Roussillon, Vallespir and Fenollet (March of Gothia). The nominal boundaries of Gothia and the Hispanic Marches vary in time, not without confusion. While Navarre and Aragon have sometimes been depicted within the Hispanic Marches, they were not part of it, but they came under the Carolingian area of influence between 794 and 806 within the Basque (also rendered as \\"Gascon\\") marches, or Duchy of Vasconia. Origins Gothia The Hispanic Marches resulted from the expansion south of the Frankish realm from their heartland in Neustria and Austrasia starting with Charles Martel in 732 and after various decades fighting between the Franks and Umayyads (Saraceni) in the Iberian Peninsula. The Muslim invasion reached the Pyrenees in the Iberian Peninsula. In 719 the forces of Al-Samh ibn Malik surged up the east coast, overwhelming the remaining Visigoth province of Septimania and establishing a fortified base at Narbonne. Control was secured by offering the local population generous terms, inter-marriage between ruling families or treaties. Further Umayyad expansion was halted on Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlanis defeat at the Battle of Toulouse. WƒÅlis were installed in Girona and Barcelona. The Muslim forces however continued to raid their Gallic neighbours to the north, reaching as far as Autun. Peace was signed in 730 between the victor at Toulouse, the Duke of Aquitaine, and 'Uthman ibn Naissa (Munuza), a Berber rebel lord stationed in Cerdanya (maybe current-day Catalonia), a region that could act as a buffer state against Umayyad expansionism. The peace treaty was sealed with the marriage of the Duke‚Äôs daughter to Munuza. However, Munuza was defeated by a Umayyad military expedition (731) and another period of Muslim expansion commenced. Aquitaine (including the Duchy of Vasconia) pledged formal allegiance to the Frankish leaders several times (Odo in 732, Hunald in 736 after being defeated), but remained actually independent. In 737 Charles led an expedition to the Lower Rhone and Septimania, possibly seeing that the Umayyad thrust was threatening his grip on Burgundy (subdued in 736), but did not manage to subjugate and keep the region. Both Aquitaine and Septimania were still out of central Frankish control after Charles's death, but Pepin the Short was determined to subdue southern Gaul. In 759, after conquering Septimania from the Umayyad, the Carolingian king focused all his might in crushing Aquitanian resistance to central Frankish power. After a ruthless war of 8 years, Aquitainian independence came to an end. Toulouse was now under the grip of the new Carolingian king Charlemagne and access to Andalusian Hispania was open for him, despite sporadic rebellions in Vasconia during the next two decades (Basques subdued in 790 by Charlemagne's new loyal strongman in Toulouse William of Gellone). Pepin's son, Charlemagne, fulfilled the Carolingian goal of extending the defensive boundaries of the empire beyond Septimania, creating a strong barrier state between the Umayyad Emirate/Caliphate of Iberia and the Frankish Empire, besides tightening control over the Duchy of Vasconia by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine ruled by his son Louis the Pious in 781. Creation The Franks created the Hispanic Marches by conquering former north-eastern territory of the Visigothic kingdom of Hispania, which had been conquered by the Muslims. The first county to be conquered was Roussillon (with Vallespir) in around 760. In 785 the county of Girona (with Besal√∫) to the south of the Pyrenees was taken. Ribagorza and Pallars were linked to Toulouse and were added to this county around 790. Urgell and Cerdanya were added in 798. The first records of the county of Emp√∫ries (with Perelada) are from 812 but the county was probably under Frankish control before 800. After a series of struggles the County of Barcelona (with Ausona) was taken by Frankish forces in 801. A number of castles were established in Arag√≥n between 798 and 802 (appointment of Count Aureolus). After subduing the Basques to the north of the Pyrenees (790), Frankish overlordship expanded to the upper Ebro (794) and Pamplona (798), when Alfonso II of Asturias also came under Charlemagne's influence. Sobrarbe was not incorporated into the March, as it appears later in history and was probably within the area of influence of the County of Aragon. The death of Charlemagne (814) was followed by a scene of open revolt and Carolingian setbacks around the Pyrenees. After defeat in Pancorbo, Pamplona, led by the native Basque lord I√±igo Arista, detached (817) and Arag√≥n ensued (820). The named Catalan counties - territories used by the Moors to enter and overrun Septimania in 719 - became in fact, a natural extension of the March of Gothia ruled by Catalans and Toulousains under the Carolingian Empire. Structure The local population of the Marches was diverse. The majority were Basques and Hispano-Romans (Goths). But there were also Muslims, and Jews from Septimania who repopulated the Frankish conquered easternmost territories of present-day North Spain and South France. The area changed with the fortunes of the empires and the feudal ambitions of the counts appointed to administrate the counties. As Frankish imperial power waned, the rulers of the March of Hispania became independent fiefs. The region would later become part of Catalonia. Charlemagne's son Louis took Barcelona from its Moorish ruler in 801, thus securing Frankish power in the borderland between the Franks and the Moors. The Counts of Barcelona then became the principal representatives of Frankish authority in the Hispanic Marches. The Marches included various outlying smaller territories, each ruled by a lesser miles with his armed retainers and who theoretically owed allegiance through the Count to the Emperor. The rulers were called counts; when they governed several counties they often took the name duke (Dux Gothiae). When the county formed the border with the Muslim Kingdom, the Frankish title marquis (Marquis de Gothie) was chosen. Besides, certain counts aspired to the Frankish title \\"Prince of Gothia\\". A margrave or Marcgravi is a Graf (\\"duke\\") of the March. The first Toulousains and Catalan lords who held the title of Counts of Barcelona, Bernard of Septimania, Humfrid, Bernard of Gothia, Borrell II and Ramon Borrell carried these titles. In the early 9th century, Charlemagne began issuing a new kind of land grant, the aprisio, which reallocated land previously held by the imperial crown fisc in deserted or abandoned areas. This included special rights and immunities that allowed considerable independence from the imperial control. Historians have interpreted the aprisio both as an early form of feudalism and in economic and military terms as a mechanism to entice settlers to a depopulated border region. Such self- sufficient landholders would aid the Counts in providing armed men to defend the Frankish frontier. Aprisio grants (the first ones were in Septimania) were given personally by the Carolingian king, so that they reinforced loyalty to central power, to counterbalance the local power exercised by the Marcher Counts. However poor communications and a distant central power allowed basic feudal entities to develop often self-sufficient and heavily agrarian. Each was ruled by a small hereditary military elite. These developments in the territories that later would become Catalonia followed similar patterns in other borderlands and Marches. For example, the first Count of Barcelona Bera was appointed by the King in 801, however subsequently strong heirs of Counts were able to inherit the title such as Sunifred, fl. 844‚Äì848. This gradually became custom until Countship became hereditary (for Wifred the Hairy in 897). The County became de facto independent under count Borrell II, when he ceased to request royal charters after the kings Lothair and Hugh Capet failed to assist him in the defense of the County against Muslim leader al-Mansur, although the change of dynasty may have played a part in that decision. The early history of Andorra in the Pyrenees provides a fairly typical example of a lordship of the region, and is the only modern survivor of the Hispanic Marches that has not been incorporated into either France or Spain. Andorra's national anthem, El Gran Carlemany, mentions this.  References  External links *Ian Meadows, \\"The Arabs in Occitania\\" *Archibald R.

The series was sponsored by General Electric's Department of Public Relations. Radio After an audition show on January 18, 1953, entitled The Token, with Dana Andrews, the radio series, a summer replacement for The Bing Crosby Program, debuted on CBS on July 9, 1953, with Ronald Colman in Random Harvest. With such guest stars as Cary Grant, Irene Dunne, Van Johnson, Jane Wyman, William Holden, Alan Young, Dorothy McGuire, John Hodiak, Ann Blyth, James Mason, Joan Fontaine, and Judy Garland, the series continued until October 1, 1953. Jaime del Valle produced and directed the show. Ken Carpenter was the host and announcer. Wilbur Hatch supplied the music. Also known as G.E. Stereo Theater, the program \\"was the first network radio series to be broadcast on FM in stereo.\\"Terrace, Vincent (1999). Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 128. Television The television version of the program, produced by MCA-TV/Revue, was broadcast every Sunday evening at 9:00 pm EST, beginning February 1 1953, and ending June 3 1962. Each of the estimated 209 television episodes was an adaptation of a novel, short story, play, film, or magazine fiction. An exception was the 1954 episode \\"Music for Christmas\\", which featured choral director Fred Waring and his group The Pennsylvanians performing Christmas music. Jacques Tourneur directed four excellent episodes, \\"The Martyr'\\" (1955), \\"Into the Night\\" (1955), \\"Aftermath\\" (1960) and \\"Star Witness: The Lili Parrish Story\\" (1961). On September 26, 1954, Ronald Reagan debuted as the only host of the program. GE added a host to provide continuity in the anthology format. The show's Nielsen ratings improved from #27 in the 1953‚Äì1954 season to #17 in 1954‚Äì1955, followed #11 in 1955‚Äì1956, #3 in 1956‚Äì1957, #7 in 1957‚Äì1958, #26 in 1958‚Äì1959, #23 in 1959‚Äì1960, and #20 in 1960‚Äì1961. General Electric Theater made the already well-known Reagan, who had appeared in many films as a \\"second lead\\" throughout his career, wealthy, due to his part ownership of the show. After eight years as host, Reagan estimated he had visited 135 GE research and manufacturing facilities, and met over a quarter-million people. During that time, he would also speak at other forums such as Rotary clubs and Moose lodges, presenting views on economic progress that in form and content were often similar to what he said in introductions, segues, and closing comments on the show as a spokesman for GE. Reagan, who would later be known as \\"The Great Communicator\\" because of his oratorical prowess, often credited these engagements as helping him develop his public-speaking abilities. Television guest stars Edie Adams and Louis Jourdan in episode \\"A Falling Angel\\" (1958). Harpo and Chico Marx performed \\"The Incredible Jewelry Robbery\\" in pantomime in 1959.

Kennedy pressured GE to cancel The General Electric Theater or at least to fire Reagan as the host if the program were to continue. The series was not dropped because of low ratings but political intervention, the younger Reagan still maintains. Michael claimed that Robert Kennedy told GE officials that the company would receive no federal contracts so long as Reagan was host of the series. Michael noted the irony that his father's dismissal propelled Reagan into the political arena, and eighteen years afterwards, Reagan would take the oath of office as the oldest person to become U.S. president up to that time (Donald Trump would surpass this record with his election in 2016). Kennedy's directive is another example of the \\"law of unintended consequences.\\" Had Kennedy stayed out of GE contract matters, there would have been no Governor or President Reagan. This statement by Michael Reagan is unsupported by any evidence, not even a reference to a conversation with Ronald Reagan, which is the only possible source of this information. Reagan biographies and autobiographies tell a rather different story, and none mention Robert F. Kennedy. From Reagan: The Life, H.W. Brands, Anchor Books, New York 2015 pg 124‚Äì125 Reagan's jeremiads against encroaching government cited the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) as a case in point ‚Äì until he got wind that TVA executives were listening and wondering to General Electric's boss, Ralph Cordiner, why they shouldn't shift their purchases to a more appreciative company. Cordiner said he wouldn't censor Reagan ‚Äì a move that caused Reagan to censor himself. Reagan recalled saying: ‚ÄúMr Cordiner, what would you say if I could make my speech just as effectively without mentioning TVA?‚Äù [He also recalled the response:] ‚ÄúWell, it would make my job easier.‚Äù Reagan concluded the story ‚ÄúDropping TVA from my speech was no problem.‚Äù [This quote is taken directly from Where's the Rest of Me?, Ronald Reagan with Richard G. Hublen, Duell, Sloan and Pearce, New York, 1965, pp. 269‚Äì270] pg 131, In 1961 the Justice Department launched a probe into price- fixing in the electrical equipment industry. General Electric was a prime target. Corporate management decided prudence lay in avoiding anything that raised the company's profile needlessly. Reagan's attacks on big government did just that. .... The company offered to keep him on pitching commercial products if he would stop talking politics. ...He decided the reduced stage was too small. From An American Life, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1990, pg 137, ‚ÄúIn 1962 there was a change in management at General Electric that brought an end to my satisfying eight-year relationship with the company. Ralph Cordiner was retiring and the new management asked me asked me, in addition to continuing as host of the GE Theater, to go on the road and become a pitchman for General Electric products ‚Äì in other words, become a salesman. I told them that after developing such a following by speaking out about the issues I believed in, I wasn't going to go out and peddle toasters. From When Character was King, Peggy Noonan, Penguin, New York, 2001, pg 84, New management asked him to stay on....but go on the road and pitch GE products. They insisted. He said no. They cancelled. Don Herbert, a television personality well known as the host of Watch Mr. Wizard, appeared as the \\"General Electric Progress Reporter,\\" adding a scientific touch to the institutional advertising pitch. The show was produced by Revue Studios, whose successor-in-interest, NBC Universal Television, was co-owned by GE. Following General Electric Theaters cancellation in 1962, the series was replaced in the same time slot by the short-lived GE-sponsored GE True, hosted by Jack Webb. On March 17, 2010, General Electric presented Reagan's widow Nancy Davis Reagan with video copies of 208 episodes of General Electric Theater, to be donated to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. On April 20, 2010, a \\"lost\\" live episode of General Electric Theater ‚Äì \\"The Dark, Dark Hours\\", which originally aired on December 12, 1954 ‚Äì was uncovered by NBC writer Wayne Federman, who was working on a television retrospective for the Reagan Centennial Celebration. The episode was noteworthy because it teamed Ronald Reagan with James Dean. Highlights were broadcast on the CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and Good Morning America.

Legal career  Garrioch joined the Colonial Service in 1936 and was subsequently appointed a First Grade Clerk in 1946, when he was picked to be a judge's secretary. He became the secretary of Justice Georges Espitalier-No√´l, who was able to persuade Chief Justice Sir Francis Herchenroder that Garrioch should be encouraged to embrace a legal career. Garrioch took the advice and won the Colonial Scholarship enabling him to complete his studies in law in the United Kingdom. He was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn and to the Mauritian Bar in 1952. On his return to Mauritius, Garrioch was immediately appointed to the post of Crown Counsel, at a time in the 1950s when it was the Chief Justice who advised the Governor on the appointment of Law Officers and District Magistrates. The established practice at that time was that members of the bar who were to join the public service had to first be appointed district magistrates; only those thought to be of the highest caliber were then transferred to the Attorney-General's Office. Garrioch moved up in the office to become Director of Public Prosecutions, which at the time was higher in the legal hierarchy than Solicitor-General. He was made a Judge of the Supreme Court in 1967.  Mauritian constitution and role in independence  In 1963, when the Colonial Secretary dispatched his Chief Legal Adviser, Anthony Rushford Q.C., in order to finalize the draft of what was to become the Mauritian constitution of 1964 (which was to be the basis for their Independence Constitution of 1967), Rushford asked Mauritius to provide the services of its best legislative draftsman to be his counterpart. The Mauritian authorities selected Garrioch, who spent several weeks at Le R√©duit to finalize the draft before it went to Her Majesty in Council. Following Sir Maurice Latour-Adrien's retirement Henry Garrioch was appointed Chief Judge of Mauritius on 20 April 1977 at the age of 61. When Sir Raman Osman retired as Governor-General of Mauritius at the end of October 1977, Garrioch was appointed acting Governor General, in line with the tradition of making the Chief Judge serve as chief administrator of the government.

He served as the island's first Chief Minister, Prime Minister of Mauritius, and Governor-General. Early life Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, also known as Kewal, was born on 18 September 1900 at Belle Rive, Mauritius, in the district of Flacq in an Indo- Mauritian family. His father, Moheeth Ramgoolam (who belonged to Koeri community), was an Indian immigrant labourer. Moheeth came to Mauritius aged 18 in a ship called The Hindoostan in 1896. His elder brother, Ramlochurn, had left the home village of Harigaon in Bihar in search of his fortune abroad. Moheeth worked as an indentured labourer and later became a Sirdar (overseer) at Queen Victoria Sugar Estate. When he married Basmati Ramchurn in 1898, he moved to Belle Rive Sugar Estate. Basmati was a young widow born in Mauritius. She already had two sons: Nuckchadee Heeramun and Ramlall Ramchurn. Ramgoolam had his early grounding in Hindi, Indian culture and philosophy, in the local evening school of the locality (called Baitka in Mauritian Hindu term), where children of the Hindu community learnt the vernacular language and glimpses of the Hindu culture. The teacher (guruji) would teach prayers and songs. Sanskrit prayers and perennial values taken from sacred scriptures like the Vedas, the Ramayana, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad Gita were also taught. He enrolled in the neighbouring R.C.A. (Roman Catholic Aided) School, run by Madame Siris without his mother's knowledge. He learned History, Geography, English and French.Our Struggle, 20th century Mauritius, Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo After leaving the pre-primary school, he went to Bel Air Government School, travelling by train, until he passed the sixth standard. At the age of seven, Ramgoolam lost his father and at the age of twelve, he suffered a serious accident in a cowshed that cost him his left eye. He continued his scholarship class at the Curepipe Boys‚Äô Government School while taking up boarding with his uncle, Harry Parsad Seewoodharry Buguth, a sworn land surveyor, in Curepipe. He would listen to the political discussions between his uncle and his circle of friends on local politics and on the current struggle for Indian independence under Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rash Behari Bose. These initial conversations were to form the basis of his political beliefs years later.The scholarship classes, which formed the basis of lower secondary schooling, permitted Ramgoolam to go straight for the Junior Cambridge at the Royal College, Curepipe, where he was educated by the likes of Reverend Fowler and Mr Harwood. After secondary school, Ramgoolam worked for 3 months in the Civil Service, despite racism within the organisation . With the financial help of his brother Ramlall, Ramgoolam was able to initiate medical studies in England.In 1921, Ramgoolam set sail on one of the ships of the Messageries maritimes for Marseille, and continued by train to London, his final destination, with a transit of a couple of days in Paris. In the French capital he purchased copies of the books of Andr√© Gide and Andr√© Malraux with both of whom he struck friendship. He graduated from University College London and attended lectures at the London School of Economics. Family Life In 1939 Ramgoolam married Sushil Ramjoorawon. She gave birth to their daughter Sunita (now Sunita Joypaul) and their son Navin Ramgoolam. Political career before Independence In 1935 he returned to Mauritius after completing medical studies in London and Seewoosagur worked to improve the living and working conditions of the bulk of the island's population which consisted of the descendants of Coolies and African slaves. In 1947 Ramgoolam joined the Labour Party. At that time the party was still under the leadership of its original founders Emmanuel Anquetil, Maurice Cur√©, Pandit Sahadeo, Renganaden Seeneevasen and Mamode Hassenjee, Jean Prosper, Barthelemy Ohsan, Samuel Barbe and Godefroy Moutia who initiated the party in 1936. In September 1940 and during the Second World War he became one of the founders of the Labour Party's newspaper Advance which advocated universal suffrage, economic reform and social justice. Ramgoolam wrote a series of articles using pseudonym Thumb Mark II which challenged the island's established conservative sugar oligarchs. He was also appointed as President of the Indian Cultural Association. From 1940 to 1953 he was an elected Municipal Councillor in Port Louis and was re-elected to serve from 1956 to 1960. Then he was elected Deputy Mayor of Port-Louis in 1956 and became Lord Mayor of Port Louis in 1958. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam served as Nominated Member of the Legislative Council from 1940 to 1948. At the 1948 General Elections he was elected Member of Legislative Council for Pamplemousses-Rivi√®re du Rempart. He was re-elected to the Legislative Council in 1953, 1959 (Triolet) and 1967 (Pamplemousses-Triolet). In 1948 and 1953 he was also appointed as member of the Executive Council. From 1951 to 1956 he joined the Civil Service to work as Liaison Officer for Education before becoming first MLA for Pamplemousses-Triolet in December 1956. In 1958 the Colonial Government appointed him as Ministerial Secretary to Treasury. He led the Mauritian Labour Party from 1959 to 1982 having taken the leadership from following the death of Guy Rozemont in March 1956. At the 1961 Constitutional Conference in London, the Parti Mauricien was in favour of an integration with Britain rather than independence within the Commonwealth. But Britain, at that time, had already decided that it would give up all its colonies with the exception of Hong-Kong, Gibraltar and the Falklands.Not a Paradise, I love you Mauritius, Dr. A. Cader Raman, Singapore National Printers Ltd, 1991 In fact, the die had already been cast as early as 1959 when Harold Macmillan had made his famous ‚ÄúWind of change blowing over Africa‚Äù speech. After the general election of 1963, Gaetan Duval, then deputy-leader of the Parti Mauricien, again lobbied for Integration with Britain. But this was once more rejected by the British who did not consider integration as ‚Äúa practical proposition for Mauritius, even if the majority of parties in Mauritius wanted it‚Äù. Under the supervision of the Colonial Office Ramgoolam served as Chief Minister and Minister of Finance from 1961 to 1965, then as Premier from 1965 to 1968, before becoming Prime Minister in 1968. In 1963, the British Conservative government assisted him to form an All-Party Government in Mauritius. His efforts were recognised as he was honoured as knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 12 June 1965. In 1967 he cooperated with the Independent Forward Bloc (IFB) led by Sookdeo Bissoondoyal (who were advocating complete decolonization and removal of British administration from all Mauritian territories) and the Comit√© d'Action Musulman (CAM) led by Abdool Razack Mohamed (which campaigned for constitutional guarantees to protect the Muslim and other minority communities in an effort to prevent a circumstantial Hindu hegemony) to form the Independence Party (Mauritius). This coalition eventually led to 1968 Independence from Great Britain after the 1967 Mauritian general election. Political career after Independence In 1969 he contracted an alliance with his party's rival Parti Mauricien Social D√©mocrate (PMSD) which was led by Gaetan Duval. This alliance allowed Ramgoolam to stay in power despite the departure of its former ally IFB from the government. Sookdeo Bissoondoyal's IFB members went into opposition whilst some IFB MP's defected to the Labour Party to maintain their ministerial portfolios. Due to the poor performance of his various governments from 1967 to 1982, his party lost the 1982 general elections when none of his candidates was elected to parliament. He lost his parliamentary seat which led to further downfall of the Labour Party. He then assisted the newly formed party named MSM and its ex-MMM leader Anerood Jugnauth to win the 1983 elections. The Labour Party became a minority party in a coalition MSM-Labour government and Ramgoolam was appointed as Governor-General, a position which he held until his death in 1985. Ramgoolam was succeeded as leader of the Labour Party by Sir Satcam Boolell in 1984 when the latter returned to the Labour Party after having formed and led a new party Mouvement Patriotique Mauricien (MPM) following his 1982 electoral defeat. Boolell remained president of the Labour Party until 1991. Ramgoolam was also the Chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity from 1976 to 1977. Legacy and recognition One rupee coin displaying the portrait of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Various streets and public places in Mauritius bear the name of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam (SSR) such as the SSR Botanical Garden, recreational centre for senior citizens, SSR Medical College, Pamplemousses SSR National Hospital (at the site of the defunct Royal Alfred Observatory), airport previously called Plaisance International Airport, Kewal Nagar (a small village previously called Belle Rive. He also figures on every Mauritian Rupee coin and on the highest note tender of Rs2,000.

At the 1959 and 1963 elections he was elected to the Legislative Council at No.17 Quartier Militaire after standing as candidate of Labour Party. In 1967 he was elected to Legislative Council at Constituency No.8 (Quartier Militaire-Moka) as candidate of the Independence Party coalition alongside Mahess Teeluck and Abdool Razack Mohamed.In 1976 he was re-elected at No.8 alongside Mahess Teeluck. He held the portfolio of Finance Minister of Mauritius during most of these terms. But at the 1982 general elections he was not elected following the landslide victory of MMM-PSM against PTr-PMSD. He served as Governor- General of Mauritius from 17 January 1986 to 12 March 1992, when it became a republic.

The mountain was named in 1858 by James Hector after the waterfall or cascade on the southern flanks of the peak. The mountain has also been called Stoney Chief, which is related to the name of the smaller neighbouring mountain Stoney Squaw, which is still in use. Cascade is the highest mountain adjacent to the townsite.  Climbing routes  Northern lights above Cascade Mountain The mountain can be climbed starting from the Norquay Ski Area base. The first portion is a fairly moderate hike, up to the Cascade Amphitheatre. Continuing upwards, the route ascends along the ridge edge until it reaches the crest where it dips before it rises to the false summit. While the false summit can be descended at its end, it is much easier to follow a trail around the western side along the exposed foot. Snow typically blocks this route almost until mid July and attempting it while snowy can entail considerable avalanche risk due to the slabby terrain and exposure. A long window of clear weather - full day - should be anticipated before attempting this climb, as many climbers have gotten into trouble and needed rescue (or died) when a storm suddenly blows in. The ascent normally takes 3 to 4 hours, while the descent along the same path takes 2 to 3 hours if all goes well, and 5 to 10 minutes if not. Looking at Cascade Mountain from Banff avenue, the ridge on the right (above the old Buffalo paddock) is the SW ridge. It was first climbed in 1977 by the late Jean Pierre Cadot and Ren√© Boisselle. In early 1900, MacCarthy (first ascent of Mt Logan in Yukon) mentioned that Cascade Mt seems to offer good rock on the SW ridge. The route starts between the two obvious buttress and gains the crest of the ridge after a few rope pitches. The upper and very steep buttress is climbed via a chimney on the left side. The entire route is 5.6 or 5.7 grade III.

Together with the Myopsina, it was formerly considered to be a suborder of the order Teuthida, in which case it was known as Oegopsina. This reclassification is due to Oegopsina and Myopsina not being demonstrated to form a clade. The Oegopsida are an often pelagic squid, with some nerito-oceanic species associated with sea mounts. They consist of 24 families and 69 genera. They have these characters in common: the head is without tentacle pockets, eyes lack a corneal covering, arms and tentacle clubs may have hooks, the buccal supports are without suckers, and oviducts in females are paired. Two families, the Bathyteuthidae and Chtenopterygidae, which have features characteristic of the Myopsida while retaining others common to the Oegopsina, are sometimes placed in the Bathyteuthoidea. The Oegopsida differ from the coastal Myopsida, characterised by the genus Loligo, which have corneal coverings over the eyes and tentacle pockets, but lack hooks, have no suckers on the buccal supports, and a single oviduct. Oegopsid squid are the only decapods that lack a pocket for the tentacles. Otherwise, they share different characters with different decapod groups. Like the Bathyteuthoidea and Myopsida, the Oegopsida have a brachial canal, which is absent in other forms. As with the Spirulidae and Idiosepiidae, the Oegopsida lack suckers on the buccal supports, and like the Bathyteuthoidea, Idiosepiidae, and Spirulidae, they have no circular muscle on the suckers. *Order Oegopsida **Family Ancistrocheiridae **Family Architeuthidae **Family Bathyteuthidae **Family Batoteuthidae **Family Brachioteuthidae **Family Chiroteuthidae **Family Chtenopterygidae **Family Cranchiidae **Family Cycloteuthidae **Family Enoploteuthidae **Family Gonatidae **Family Histioteuthidae **Family Joubiniteuthidae **Family Lepidoteuthidae **Family Lycoteuthidae **Family Magnapinnidae **Family Mastigoteuthidae **Family Neoteuthidae **Family Octopoteuthidae **Family Ommastrephidae **Family Onychoteuthidae **Family Pholidoteuthidae **Family Promachoteuthidae **Family Psychroteuthidae **Family Pyroteuthidae **Family Thysanoteuthidae **Parateuthis tunicata (incertae sedis) These families group into a number of different clades but these have not yet been formally given names.

History Dreux was known in ancient times as Durocassium, the capital of the Durocasses Celtic tribe. Despite the legend, its name was not related with Druids. The Romans established here a fortified camp known as Castrum Drocas. In the Middle Ages, Dreux was the centre of the County of Dreux. The first count of Dreux was Robert, the son of King Louis the Fat. The first large battle of the French Wars of Religion occurred at Dreux, on 19 December 1562, resulting in a hard-fought victory for the Catholic forces of the duc de Montmorency. In October 1983, the Front National won 55% of the vote in the second round of elections for the city council of Dreux, in one of its first significant electoral victories. Population Sights Chapelle royale de Dreux In 1775, the lands of the comt√© de Dreux had been given to the Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthi√®vre by his cousin Louis XVI. In 1783, the duke sold his domain of Rambouillet to Louis XVI. On 25 November of that year, in a long religious procession, Penthi√®vre transferred the nine caskets containing the remains of his parents, the Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse and Marie Victoire de Noailles, comtesse de Toulouse, his wife, Marie Th√©r√®se F√©licit√© d'Este, Princess of Mod√®ne, and six of their seven children, from the small medieval village church next to the castle in Rambouillet, to the chapel of the Coll√©giale Saint-√âtienne de Dreux.G.

On 21 November of that same year, in the midst of the French Revolution, a mob desecrated the crypt and threw the ten bodies in a mass grave in the Chanoines cemetery of the Coll√©giale Saint-√âtienne. In 1816, the duc de Penthi√®vre's daughter, Louise Marie Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon, duchesse d'Orl√©ans, had a new chapel built on the site of the mass grave of the Chanoines cemetery, as the final resting place for her family.

The magazine of art vol.6 p.133 A whipping boy was a boy educated alongside a prince (or boy monarch) in early modern Europe, who received corporal punishment for the prince's transgressions in his presence. The prince was not punished himself because his royal status exceeded that of his tutor; seeing a friend punished would provide an equivalent motivation not to repeat the offence. An archaic proverb which captures a similar idea is \\"to beat a dog before a lion.\\"Wesselski 1928, p.127 [German equivalent: \\"den Hund vor dem L√∂wen schlagen\\"]; Whipping was a common punishment of tutors at that time. There is little contemporary evidence for the existence of whipping boys, and evidence that some princes were indeed whipped by their tutors, although Nicholas Orme suggests that nobles might have been beaten less often than other pupils.Orme 2017 pp.33‚Äì35 Some historians regard whipping boys as entirely mythical; others suggest they applied only in the case of a boy king, protected by divine right, and not to mere princes. In Renaissance humanism, Erasmus' treatises \\"The Education of a Christian Prince\\" (1516) and \\"Declamatio de pueris statim ac liberaliter instituendis\\" (1530) mention the inappropriateness of physical chastisement of princes, but do not mention proxy punishment.Bushnell 1996 p.50 Hartley Coleridge wrote in 1852, \\"to be flogged by proxy was the exclusive privilege of royal blood. ... It was much coveted for the children of the poorer gentry, as the first step in the ladder of preferment.\\" John Gough Nichols wrote in 1857, \\"the whole matter is somewhat legendary, and though certain vicarious or rather minatory punishments may have been occasionally adopted, it does not seem likely that any one individual among the King's schoolfellows should have been uniformly selected, whether he were in fault or not, as the victim or scape-goat of the royal misdemeanours\\". In current English, a \\"whipping boy\\" is a metaphor which may have a similar meaning to scapegoat, fall guy, or sacrificial lamb; alternatively it may mean a perennial loser or a victim of group bullying. Putative historical examples Young royals alleged to have had whipping boys include: * Conrad, King of Jerusalem and later of Italy (1228‚Äì1254) had twelve companions beaten in his stead by his tutors, according to the ' (c.1300), so that \\"King Conrad took great heed not to act wrongly, for pity of them\\".Wesselski 1928 pp.126‚Äì127 Alessandro d'Ancona sees an antecedent of the Conrad novella in Phaedrus' fable \\"The Bullock and the Old Ox\\".; ; * Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset (1519‚Äì1536), whose tutor Richard Croke complained in 1527 that Richmond's usher, George Cotton, was undermining Croke's authority; among the charges were withdrawing \\"those boys whose punishment it was necessary to deter his princely pupil from the repetition of his faults\\", and claiming it was unseemly for Croke to whip them in Richmond's presence. * Edward VI of England (1537‚Äì1553) to whose court Barnaby Fitzpatrick, later 2nd Baron Upper Ossory (c.1535‚Äì1581) was sent as a hostage by his father the 1st baron. Thomas Fuller's Church-History of Britain (1655) calls Fitzpatrick Edward's \\"proxy for correction\\". John Guy calls this a myth, since their tutor Richard Cox wrote of beating Edward with his staff. Konrad Heresbach in De Educandis Erudiendisque Principum Liberis (1592) recounted that he was told in London in 1547 that, when the young king uttered profanities learnt from an (unnamed) playmate, the friend was whipped in his presence and Edward warned that he deserved similar punishment.; Cited and translated in Bushnell 1996 p.54 * The future Frederick IV of Liegnitz (1552‚Äì96), for whom (1552‚Äì1616) was described in 1856 as the by Gustav Freytag, popularising the concept in Germany. Freytag's claim is not supported by other accounts of Schweinichen. * The future Charles I of England (1600‚Äì49), to whom William Murray, later 1st Earl of Dysart (c.1600‚Äì55) was \\"page and whipping‚Äìboy\\" according to Gilbert Burnet's History of my own time (1723).Wesselski 1928 p.126 William's uncle Thomas Murray tutored both boys. As king, Charles appointed William Groom of the Bedchamber. * The young Louis XV of France (1710‚Äì1774) was supplied by his governess Madame de Ventadour with playmates of his own age, including a Versailles cobbler's son nicknamed (\\"the hussar\\") from a costume he wore.; Marie, marquise du Deffand wrote in 1769 that this boy would be punished in the king's stead, whence the victim of any bully was colloquially called their hussard.; in 1825 called the method \\"strange\\", \\"rather barbarous\\", and \\"iniquitous\\", and said Louis continued to neglect his studies regardless. * Spanish royal princes had Francisco Alphonso de la Torre, an illegitimate son of Manuel Godoy, as proxy to receive \\"either slaps or the whip\\", according to the 1898 memoirs of Fran√ßois Certain de Canrobert, who served in the French Army under de la Torre in 1842 in Algeria and ascribed his irascibility to this education. *Chinese imperial princes of the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) had banner attendants denoted by the Manchu term (Chinese transcription ); at first this meant youths educated alongside the prince, and later his special \\"reading partner\\" and bodyguard. These were influential in the Kangxi reign (1661‚Äì1722) but subsequently lost status. In 1876, the North-China Herald commented on the announcement in the Peking Gazette of the start of the education of the five-year-old Guangxu Emperor: \\"The next appointment to be made (though not gazetted) will probably be that of the child who, according to the Manchu Imperial custom, shares his Majesty's studies under the name of ', in the capacity of a or \\"whipping-boy.\\" Whenever the Son of Heaven is naughty or inattentive, the ' is beaten or disgraced\\". An adult example often included in discussions of whipping boys is provided by the French Catholic prelates Arnaud d'Ossat (1537‚Äì1604) and Jacques Davy Duperron (1556‚Äì1618), who were symbolically whipped by Pope Clement VIII in 1593 in proxy expiation on behalf of Henry IV of France (1553‚Äì1610), who had renounced Protestantism.Mentioned in: Thiselton Dyer 1903 p.307; ; The magazine of art vol.6 pp.170‚Äì171; In later literature Samuel Rowley's 1604 play When You See Me You Know Me depicts the childhood of the future Edward VI. When he skips class to play tennis, Edward \\"Ned\\" Browne is sent to the chapel to be whipped by the master of children. Cranmer says, \\"Since he was whipped thus for the prince's faults. / His grace hath got more knowledge in a month. / Than he attained in a year before, / For still the fearful boy, to save his breech, / Doth hourly haunt him, wheresoe'er he goes.\\" The prince persuades king Henry VIII to knight Ned: \\"the poor gentleman was pitifully wounded in the back parts, as may appear by the scar, if his knightship would but untruss there\\". Ned hopes the tutors will refrain from whipping a knight, to which the fool retorts, \\"If they do, he shall make thee a lord, and then they dare not.\\" This work may have helped the idea of a whipping boy to take root.; John Donne alluded to proxy whipping in a sermon he preached in 1628: \\"Sometimes, when the children of great persons offend at school, another person is whipped for them, and that affects them, and works upon a good nature; but if that person should take physic for them in a sickness, it would do them no good: God's corrections upon others may work by way of example upon thee; but because thou art sick for physic, take it thyself.\\" The earliest attestation of the word \\"whipping boy\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary is from a 1647 Bible commentary by John Trapp on : \\"Those Presbyters that sin publikely ... and those who were convicted by two or three witnesses ... : Rebuke before all, yet not as if they were whipping boyes\\".; the 1647 citation is reprinted in In Book V of Gil Blas (1715) by Alain-Ren√© Lesage, when the Marquis of Leganez forbids his son's tutors from beating him, Don Raphael is flogged in his stead: \\"a most ingenious device, by which to keep this troublesome young lordling in awe, without trenching on his foolish father's injunctions\\". The Fortunes of Nigel (1822) by Walter Scott describes Malagrowther, the fictional whipping boy of the young James VI of Scotland (later also James I of England): \\"Under the stern rule, indeed, of George Buchanan, who did not approve of the vicarious mode of punishment, James bore the penance of his own faults, and Mungo Malagrowther enjoyed a sinecure; but James's other pedagogue, Master Patrick Young, went more ceremoniously to work, and appalled the very soul of the youthful King by the floggings which he bestowed on the whipping-boy, when the royal task was not suitably performed.\\" In Mark Twain's 1881 novel, The Prince and the Pauper, the pauper's masquerade as Edward VI is aided by information from the prince's whipping boy,Bauer & Zirker 2015, ¬∂41; Twain 2016 Ch.XIV: 'Le Roi est mort'‚Äî'vive le Roi.' son and namesake of the late Sir Humphrey Marlow, a \\"Head Lieutenant\\" in Henry VIII's Household.Bauer & Zirker 2015, ¬∂41; Twain 2016, * Ch.XXIX: To London \\"'good old Sir Humphrey, Head Lieutenant of the late King‚Äôs kitchen, or stables, or something'‚ÄîMiles could not remember just what or which...\\" * Ch.XXXIII: Edward as King. *:\\"Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?\\" *:The boy started, and said to himself, \\"Lord! mine old departed father!\\" Twain wrote, \\"James I. and Charles II. had whipping-boys, when they were little fellows, to take their punishment for them when they fell short in their lessons; so I have ventured to furnish my small prince with one, for my own purposes.\\"Bauer & Zirker 2015, ¬∂41; Twain 2016, Notes: No.8 The Whipping Boy by Sid Fleischman, which won the 1987 Newbery Medal for children's books, tells of the brattish Prince Horace who learns humility on an adventure with his whipping boy, a rat-catcher named Jemmy. In George R. R. Martin's fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire, published from 1991, the characters Tommen Baratheon and Joffrey Baratheon have a whipping boy named Pate. In David Belbin's 2002 children's novel Boy King, Barnaby FitzPatrick is whipped by John Cheke for teaching Edward VI swear-words; when Edward protests that nobody has whipping boys any more, Cheke says \\"the Duke of Richmond had one\\". Cheke relents from giving FitzPatrick the whipping owed to Edward. Sarah Ruhl's 2016 play \\"Scenes from Court Life, or The Whipping Boy and His Prince\\" includes whipping boys in its depictions of Charles I and Charles II of England. Modern slavery Some accounts of modern slavery include instances of slaves punished for the offences of a master's child. In 19th-century southern China, among slave boys as study companions to candidates for the imperial examinations, one example was noted by James L. Watson. In Alex Tizon's 2017 nonfiction essay \\"My Family's Slave\\", the author's mother recounts a 1940s incident in which, caught in a lie, she made Lola, the titular servant, receive the punishment of 12 lashes of her father's belt.

The park is made up of donated by Mary Schenley in 1889 and another that the city subsequently purchased from her. Another were acquired at a later date, bringing the park's total size to , and making it the second largest municipal park in Pittsburgh, behind Frick Park. The park borders the campuses of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, and technically Carnegie Mellon University is actually within Schenley Park. Facilities Stone footbridge over Panther Hollow Run, below the visitor's center. Schenley Park features a grand entrance, Schenley Plaza, and several miles of hiking trails and a large pond in Panther Hollow. Across from the Phipps Conservatory is Flagstaff Hill, a popular place to watch outdoor movies in the summer. In the early days of Schenley Park, the area known as \\"The Oval\\" was used for horse racing. Today, it has 13 tennis courts, an all weather running track, and a soccer field. There is also an ice skating rink, public swimming pool, and an 18-hole disc golf course nearby. Schenley Park also contains the Bob O'Connor Golf Course. The golf course includes an indoor practice facility where golfers can play a \\"virtual\\" round on Pebble Beach and other famous courses. Cross country running meets are held in the park. It is the home course for the Carnegie Mellon University men's and women's cross country teams. The 1921 USA Cross Country Championships were held in the park. Annual events Since 1983, Schenley Park has been home to a vintage motor sports car race, the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix, that takes place annually in mid-July. Additionally, since 1993, the park has been home to the Komen Pittsburgh Race for the Cure, an annual fundraising event for breast cancer and Mother's Day tradition with more than 35,000 participants. Carnegie Mellon University's annual Spring Carnival contests its Sweepstakes, a buggy race, on Tech Avenue, Schenley Drive, and Frew Street. History Neill Log House in Schenley Park, built circa 1787 (or before), once belonged to the family of Robert Neill, and later to Col. James O'Hara and his granddaughter Mary Schenley (for whom the park is named). In 1842, Mary Elizabeth Croghan of Pittsburgh, who was 15 at the time, eloped with 43-year- old Captain Edward Schenley. The couple moved to England. Mary's father attempted to terminate her inheritance in a lawsuit, but was unsuccessful. Mary's maternal grandfather, General James O'Hara, bequeathed to her a parcel of land known as the \\"Mt. Airy Tract.\\" The Westinghouse Memorial in Schenley Park Mary's wealth attracted the attention of several land developers in the Pittsburgh area as well as Edward Bigelow, the Director of the Department of Public Works in Pittsburgh. In 1889, Bigelow learned that the agent of a land developer planned to travel to London to attempt to purchase the land from Mary. Bigelow sent an East Liberty lawyer by train to New York City where he then boarded a steamer bound for England. The lawyer beat the real estate agent by two days. After negotiations with Mary, Bigelow's lawyer entered into an agreement to give 300 acres (1.21 km¬≤) of the Mt. Airy Tract to the city of Pittsburgh with an option to purchase 120 (0.49 km¬≤) more, under the conditions that the park be named after her and never be sold. The city agreed and immediately purchased the additional 120 acres (0.49 km¬≤) of land. Panther Hollow Bridge seen from Panther Hollow Lake in Schenley Park. Bigelow began to develop the newly renamed Schenley Park for recreational uses. He hired William Falconer to lead the Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens which was built in 1893. In 1895, Andrew Carnegie built the Carnegie Museum and Music Hall, establishing Oakland and Schenley Park as a cultural icon. Forbes Field, the home field of the Pittsburgh Pirates, was adjacent to Schenley Park during its lifespan (1909‚Äì1970). Recent developments *In 2001, after extensive renovations, the Schenley Park Visitor Center opened in one of the park's original buildings. The building had previously served as a tool shed, the home of the Pittsburgh Civic Garden Center, and a nature museum, until closing in the late 1980s. *In spring 2006, the Schenley Plaza area was converted to its original use as a grand entrance to Schenley Park. Although it was originally designed as a grand entrance, it had been used as a parking lot for many years. The new park area features a carousel and several small food stands.

Its capital was at Sana Ωa. It united with the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (commonly known as South Yemen), on May 22, 1990, to form the current Republic of Yemen. History Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 after the Great War, northern Yemen became an independent state as the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen. On 27 September 1962, revolutionaries inspired by the Arab nationalist ideology of United Arab Republic (Egyptian) President Gamal Abdel Nasser deposed the newly crowned King Muhammad al-Badr, took control of Sana Ωa, and established the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR). This coup d'√©tat marked the beginning of the North Yemen Civil War that pitted YAR troops, assisted by the United Arab Republic (Egypt), against Badr's royalist forces, supported by Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Conflict continued periodically until 1967, when Egyptian troops were withdrawn to join the conflict of the Six-Day War. By 1968, following a final royalist siege of Sana Ωa, most of the opposing leaders reached a reconciliation. Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic in 1970. Unlike East and West Germany or North and South Korea, the YAR and its southern neighbor, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), also known as South Yemen, remained relatively friendly, though relations were often strained. Following the Yemenite War of 1972, the two nations declared that unification would eventually occur. However, these plans were put on hold due to the Yemenite War of 1979, and war was stopped only by an Arab League intervention. The goal of unity was reaffirmed by the northern and southern heads of state during a summit meeting in Kuwait in March 1979.  Unification  In May 1988, the YAR and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions. They agreed to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarize the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of a national identification card. Official Yemeni unification took place on May 22, 1990, with a planned, 30-month process, scheduled for completion in November 1992.

Cascade Mountain towers over the Van Hoevenberg ski center, the venue for bobsledding at the 1980 Winter Olympics.

The main trailhead is on Route 73, 6 miles (10 km) east of Lake Placid, at Cascade Pass, overlooking Cascade Lake. The summit is visible from the trailhead, a rare occurrence in the High Peaks. The well-used trail follows red plastic markers and takes the hiker up 2.2 miles (4.6 km) and almost 2,000 vertical feet (600 vertical m) to the mountain's bare-rock summit, which, while it resembles the alpine summits found on many higher peaks, is instead the result of a 1903 fire. Views are possible in all directions, and on a clear day with good weather one often finds many hikers on the summit. Porter Mountain, another of the High Peaks, is an easy side- trip.

Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994) 524. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to Aristotle (Poetics) but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the Russian Formalists, particularly Vladimir Propp (Morphology of the Folktale, 1928), and Mikhail Bakhtin's theories of heteroglossia, dialogism, and the chronotope first presented in The Dialogic Imagination (1975). History The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the structuralist quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the grammars used as a basis for parsing sentences in some forms of linguistics. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; Percy Lubbock's work in point of view (The Craft of Fiction, 1921) offers a case in point. In 1966 a special issue of the journal Communications proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a manifesto. It included articles by Barthes, Claude Br√©mond, Genette, Greimas, Todorov and others, which in turn often referred to the works of Vladimir ProppHerman, David and Jahn, Manfred and Ryan, Marie-Laure (2005) Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory, pp.574‚Äì5Bamberg, Michael G. W. (1998) Oral Versions of Personal Experience: Three Decades of Narrative Analysis. A Special Issue of the Journal of Narrative and Life History, p.40 (1895‚Äì1970). Jonathan Culler (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands > implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a > distinction between \\"story,\\" a sequence of actions or events conceived as > independent of their manifestation in discourse, and \\"discourse,\\" the > discursive presentation or narration of events.' Jonathan Culler, The > Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction, Routledge Classics > ed. (London: Routledge, 2001) 189. The Russian Formalists first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet fabula and sujet. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. histoire/discours, histoire/r√©cit, story/plot. The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology.Ruth Ronen, \\"Paradigm Shift in Plot Models: An Outline of the History of Narratology\\", Poetics Today, 11(4):817‚Äì842 (Winter 1990). The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993,Meir Sternberg, Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction, (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1993.) Ricoeur, 1984, and Baroni, 2007)Rapha√´l Baroni, La Tension narrative. Suspense, curiosit√© et surprise, (Paris: Seuil, 2007). have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot. Applications Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non- literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term \\"narratology\\" is most typically applied to literary theory and literary criticism, as well as film theory and (to a lesser extent) film criticism. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include sociolinguistic studies of oral storytelling (William Labov) and in conversation analysis or discourse analysis that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, graphic novels, the infinite canvas, and narrative sculptures linked to topology and graph theory. F√©lix Lambert, 2015, \\"Narrative sculptures: graph theory, topology and new perspectives in narratology.\\" However, constituent analysis of a type where narremes are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of linguistics, semiotics, or literary theory.Henri Wittmann, \\"Th√©orie des narr√®mes et algorithmes narratifs,\\" Poetics 4.1 (1975): 19‚Äì28.  Narratology in new media  Digital-media theorist and professor Janet Murray theorized a shift in storytelling and narrative structure in the twentieth century as a result of scientific advancement in her 1998 book Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace. Murray argues that narrative structures such as the multi-narrative more accurately reflected \\"post-Einstein physics\\" and the new perceptions of time, process, and change, than the traditional linear narrative. The unique properties of computers are better-suited for expressing these \\"limitless, intersecting\\" stories or \\"cyberdramas.\\" These cyberdramas differ from traditional forms of storytelling in that they invite the reader into the narrative experience through interactivity i.e. hypertext fiction and Web soap The Spot. Murray also controversially declared that video games ‚Äì particularly role-playing games and life-simulators like The Sims, contain narrative structures or invite the users to create them. She supported this idea in her article \\"Game Story to Cyberdrama\\" in which she argued that stories and games share two important structures: contest and puzzles.  Electronic literature and cybertext  Development and exclusive consumption on digital devices and interactivity are key characteristics of electronic literature. This has resulted in varying narrative structures of these interactive media. Nonlinear narratives serve as the base of many interactive fictions. Sometimes used interchangeably with hypertext fiction, the reader or player plays a significant role in the creation of a unique narrative developed by the choices they make within the story-world. Stuart Moulthrop's Victory Garden is one of the first and most studied examples of hypertext fiction, featuring 1,000 lexias and 2,800 hyperlinks. In his book Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, Espen Aarseth conceived the concept of cybertext, a subcategory of ergodic literature, to explain how the medium and mechanical organization of the text affects the reader's experience: > ...when you read from a cybertext, you are constantly reminded of > inaccessible strategies and paths not taken, voices not heard. Each decision > will make some parts of the text more, and others less, accessible, and you > may never know the exact results of your choices; that is, exactly what you > missed. The narrative structure or game-worlds of these cybertexts are compared to a labyrinth that invites the player, a term Aarseth deems more appropriate than reader, to play, explore and discover paths within these texts. Two kinds of labyrinths which are referenced by Aarseth are the unicursal labyrinth which holds one single, winding path that leads to a hidden center, and the multicursal labyrinth, synonymous with a maze, which is branching and complex with the path and direction chosen by the player. These concepts help to distinguish between ergodic (unicursal) and nonergodic literature (multicursal). Some works such as Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire have proven to potentially be both depending on the path the reader takes. Theorist of Narratology Art critic and philosopher, Arthura Danto, refers to the narrative as describing two separate events. Danto, A. C. (1973). Analytical Philosophy of Action. United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press. Narrative is also linked to language. The way a story can be manipulated by a character, or in the display of medium contributes to how a story is seen by the world. Rimmon-Kenan, S. (1989).

Retrieved September 25, 2020, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/30225242 Theorists have argued for a long time about the form and context of narratology. American psychologist Robert Sternburg argued that narratology is \\"structuralism at variance with the idea of structure‚Äù. This basis goes with the French-American belief that narratology is a logical perversion, meaning that it followed a course that at the time did not seem logical. Darby, D. (2001). Form and Context: An Essay in the History of Narratology. Poetics Today 22(4), 829-852. https://www.muse.jhu.edu/article/27881.

However, in his findings, Greimas says that narratology can be used to describe phenomena outside of the written word and linguistics as a whole. He establishes a connection between the physical form of something and the language used to describe that something which breaks the structural code that many other theorists base their research on.

Paul Bogle (1820 ‚Äì 24 October 1865)Dugdale-Pointon, T., \\"Paul Bogle, 1822-1865\\". Military History Encyclopedia good on the Web, 22 September 2008. was a Jamaican Baptist deacon and activist. He is a National Hero of Jamaica. He was a leader of the 1865 Morant Bay protesters, who marched for justice and fair treatment for all the people in Jamaica. After leading the Morant Bay rebellion, Bogle was captured by government troops, tried and convicted by British authorities under martial law, and hanged on 24 October 1865 in the Morant Bay court house.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994). Bogle had become a friend of wealthy landowner and fellow Baptist George William Gordon, a bi-racial man who served in the Assembly as one of two representatives from St. Thomas-in-the-East parish. Gordon was instrumental in Bogle being appointed deacon of Stony Gut Baptist Church in 1864. Conditions were hard for black peasants, due to social discrimination, flooding and crop failure, and epidemics. The required payment of poll taxes prevented most of them from voting. In August 1865, Gordon criticised the British governor, Edward John Eyre, for sanctioning \\"everything done by the higher class to the oppression of the negroes\\".Kevin O'Brien Chang, \\"Paul Bogle - Defender Of The People\\", The Gleaner, 25 July 2012. Bogle concentrated on improving the conditions of the poor.E. L. Bute and H. J. P. Harmer, The Black Handbook: The People, History and Politics of Africa and the African Diaspora, London & Washington: Cassell, 1997; p. 10. As awareness of social injustices and people's grievances grew, Bogle led a group of small farmers 45 miles to the capital, Spanish Town, hoping to meet with Governor Eyre to discuss their issues, but they were denied an audience.Clinton Hutton, \\"Review: 'The Killing Time': The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica by GAD Heuman, Social and Economic Studies Vol. 44, No. 1 (MARCH 1995), pp. 191-205, via JSTOR; accessed 13 July 2016 The people of Stony Gut lost confidence and trust in the Government, and Bogle‚Äôs supporters grew in number in the parish.  The Morant Bay Rebellion  On 7 October 1865, Bogle and some supporters killed two men from Stony Gut. A black man was convicted and sentenced to prison on charges of trespassing on a long abandoned plantation. One member of Bogle‚Äôs group protested in court over the case, but was immediately arrested, angering the crowd further. He was rescued moments later when Bogle and his men took to the market square and retaliated. The police were severely beaten and forced to retreat.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 80-2. On Monday, October 9, 1865, warrants were issued against Bogle and a number of others for riot and assault. The police arrived in Stony Gut to arrest Bogle but met with stiff resistance from the residents. They fought the police, forcing them to retreat to Morant Bay. A few days later on October 11, 1865, there was a vestry meeting in the Court House. That day Bogle led hundreds of followers, armed with sticks and machetes, on a protest march to the court house. The authorities had mustered a volunteer militia, who fired into the protesters after stones were thrown, killing seven men. The protesters set fire to the Court House and nearby buildings. When officials tried to leave, several were killed by the angry mob outside; a total of 25 on both sides died that day. Black peasants rose up and took control of the parish for two days. The governor quickly retaliated, declaring martial law and ordering troops to capture the rebels and suppress the rebellion. The troops destroyed Stony Gut and Bogle's chapel, killing more than 400 persons outright across the parish, including women and children. They arrested more than 300 persons, including Bogle. The Jamaican Maroons from Moore Town captured Bogle on behalf of the British military, and delivered him to the colonial authorities.Gad Heuman, The Killing Time: The Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994). He was tried under martial law and quickly executed, as were many others. Others, including women, and brought back to Morant Bay to be tried under martial law. Gordon was convicted of conspiracy and hanged on 23 October. Back in Britain there was public outcry, and increased opposition from liberals against Eyre's handling of the situation, with accusations against him of murder. Supporters praised the governor for acting quickly in the crisis to suppress a potentially larger rebellion.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 164-182. Bogle was later hanged on October 24, 1865. Aftermath By the end of 1865 the \\"Governor Eyre Case\\" had become the subject of widespread national debate. In January 1866, a Royal Commission was sent to investigate the events. Governor Eyre was suspended and recalled to England and eventually dismissed. The national government changed that of Jamaica. The House of Assembly resigned its charter, and Jamaica was made a Crown Colony, governed directly from Britain.Heuman, The Killing Time, pp. 164-182. The \\"Eyre Controversy\\" turned into a long and increasingly public issue, dividing well-known figures of the day. It may have contributed to the fall of the government. In 1866 John Stuart Mill set up and chaired the Jamaica Committee to examine the atrocities committed in Jamaica in the course of ending the rebellion.Autobiography, John Stuart Mill - on the ‚Äúatrocities‚Äù committed by Governor Eyre and his troops in putting down the Jamaica rebellion (1866) Thomas Carlyle set up a rival committee to defend Eyre. His supporters included John Ruskin, Charles Kingsley, Charles Dickens and Alfred, Lord Tennyson.Heuman, The Killing Time, p. 172. The Morant Bay rebellion turned out to be one of the defining points in Jamaica's struggle for both political and economical enhancement. Bogle‚Äôs demonstration ultimately achieved its objectives and paved the way for new attitudes.  Legacy  In 1969 Paul Bogle was named a National Hero along with George William Gordon, Marcus Garvey, Sir Alexander Bustamante and Norman Washington Manley. In the 1970s, two other National Heroes were added in the form of Samuel Sharpe and Queen Nanny of the Maroons. Bogle is depicted on the heads side of the Jamaican 10 cent coin. His face was also depicted on the Jamaican two-dollar bill, from 1969 until 1989, when the two-dollar bill was phased out. The Paul Bogle High School in the parish of his birth is named after him. He is referred to together with Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the Haitian Revolution, in the name of the London-based publishing company Bogle-L'Ouverture.AIM25.  In popular culture  As a national hero, Paul Bogle is referenced in many works of Jamaican culture. Most notably, dancehall performer Gerald Levy's stage name was \\"Bogle\\" (also \\"Mr Bogle\\" and \\"Father Bogle\\"). Third World produced a song about Bogle's execution.Heuman, The Killing Time, p. 186. Other reggae artists who have named and written songs in tribute to Paul Bogle include Lee Scratch Perry and a co-production between The Aggrovators, and the Revolutionaries. Bogle is mentioned in songs by Burning Spear, Brigadier Jerry, The Cimarons, Steel Pulse, Prince Far I, Lauryn Hill, Third World and General Trees. In \\"So Much Things to Say\\", by Bob Marley & The Wailers (and subsequently covered by Lauryn Hill), Marley mentions Bogle in the same breath as Jesus Christ and Marcus Garvey, concluding, \\"I'll never forget no way they turned their backs on Paul Bogle, so don't you forget no youth who you are and where you stand in the struggle.\\" Paul Bogle is mentioned in the songs \\"See them a come\\" and \\"Innocent blood\\" by the reggae band Culture. Tarrus Riley also mentions Paul Bogle in the song \\"Shaka Zulu Pickney\\", alluding his ancestry as a freedom fighter. Paul Bogle and the events outlined above are the theme of \\"Ballard of 65\\" by General Trees. The British rapper Akala references Bogle on the track \\"Maangamizi\\" from his album The Thieves Banquet, saying: \\"Probably don't know the Haitian revolution caused the French to sell half of America, nor know the role that Africans played in the Civil War for that same America. If you ain't heard of Nanny of the Maroons or Bogle, you probably believe what they told you\\". Jamaican reggae and dancehall musician Junior Reid mentions Paul Bogle in the song \\"Same Boat\\", which recalls the era of slavery, by saying \\"Paul Bogle haffi run like Usain Bolt\\". Both George William Gordon and Paul Bogle are mentioned in Horace Andy's \\"Our Jamaican National Heroes\\", while Ruddy Thomas' \\"Grandfather Bogle\\" is a Bogle tribute.

Queen and co-ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt with her brother Ptolemy XIII from 48 BC ‚Äì 47 BC, she was one of the last members of the Ptolemaic dynasty of ancient Egypt. Arsino√´ IV was also the half sister of Cleopatra VII.Beard, Mary \\"The skeleton of Cleopatra's sister? Steady on.\\" Times Literary Supplement, March 16, 2009 For her role in conducting the Siege of Alexandria (47 BC) against her sister Cleopatra, Arsino√´ was taken as a prisoner of war to Rome by the Roman triumvir Julius Caesar following the defeat of Ptolemy XIII in the Battle of the Nile. Arsino√´ was then exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus in Roman Anatolia, but she was executed there by orders of triumvir Mark Antony in 41 BC at the behest of his lover Cleopatra. History Arsino√´ was the third, possibly fourth daughter of Ptolemy XII by an unknown woman (presumably since Cleopatra VII's probable mother Cleopatra V had died or been repudiated not long after Cleopatra VII was born.) When Ptolemy XII died in 51 BC, he left his eldest son and daughter, Ptolemy and Cleopatra, as joint rulers of Egypt, but Ptolemy soon dethroned Cleopatra and forced her to flee from Alexandria. Julius Caesar arrived in Alexandria in 48 BC pursuing his rival, Pompey, whom he had defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus. When he arrived in Alexandria, he was presented with Pompey's head. The execution of his longtime friend and foe ended the possibility of an alliance between Caesar and Ptolemy, and he sided with Cleopatra's faction. He declared that in accordance with Ptolemy XII's will, Cleopatra and Ptolemy would rule Egypt jointly, and in a similar motion restored Cyprus, which had been annexed by Rome in 58 BC, to Egypt's rule and gave it to Arsino√´ and her youngest brother, Ptolemy XIV. Caesar had Ptolemy's regent, the eunuch Pothinus, executed while the general Achillas escaped and began besieging Alexandria. However Arsino√´ then escaped from the capital with her mentor, the eunuch Ganymedes, and took command of the Egyptian army. She also proclaimed herself Queen as Arsino√´ IV, executed Achillas, and placed Ganymedes second in command of the army immediately below herself.\\"Total War Center - The Siege of Alexandria and the Battle of the Nile\\". http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?480346-The-Siege-of-Alexandria- and-the-Battle-of-the-Nile-48-47-BCEJulius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.112.10-12; De Bello Alexandrino 4; Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.39.1-2; 42.40.1; Lucan, Pharsalia 10.519-523 Under Arsino√´'s leadership, the Egyptians enjoyed some success against the Romans. The Egyptians trapped Caesar in a section of the city by building walls to close off the streets. Then Arsino√´ directed Ganymedes to pour seawater into the canals that supplied Caesar‚Äôs cisterns which caused panic among Caesar‚Äôs troops.Total War Center: \\"The Siege of Alexandria and the Battle of the Nile\\" http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?480346-The-Siege-of-Alexandria- and-the-Battle-of-the-Nile-48-47-BCE Caesar countered this measure by digging wells into the porous limestone beneath the city that contained fresh water. This only partially alleviated the situation, so he then sent ships out along the coast to search for more fresh water there. Caesar realized that he would need to break out of the city and hoped to do so by gaining control of the harbor. He launched an attack to seize control of the Lighthouse of Alexandria but Arsino√´'s forces drove him back. Recognizing his imminent defeat, Caesar removed his armor and purple cloak so that he could swim to the safety of a nearby Roman ship. The leading Egyptian officers, having become disappointed with Ganymedes, and under a pretext of wanting peace, negotiated with Caesar to exchange Arsino√´ for Ptolemy XIII.De Bello Alexandrino 23-24 and, with some deviations, Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.42 After Ptolemy was released he continued the war until the Romans received reinforcements and inflicted a decisive defeat upon the Egyptians. Arsino√´, now in Roman captivity, was transported to Rome, where in 46 BC she was forced to appear in Caesar's triumph and was paraded behind a burning effigy of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which had been the scene of her victory over him.Cassius Dio, Roman History 43.19.2-3; Appian, Civil Wars 2.101.420 Despite the custom of strangling prominent prisoners in triumphs when the festivities concluded, Caesar was pressured to spare Arsino√´ and granted her sanctuary at the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. Arsino√´ lived in the temple for a few years, always keeping a watchful eye on her sister Cleopatra, who perceived Arsino√´ as a threat to her power. In 41 BC, at Cleopatra's instigation, Mark Antony ordered Arsino√´'s execution on the steps of the temple. Her murder was a gross violation of the temple sanctuary and an act that scandalised Rome.BBC One documentary, Cleopatra: Portrait of a Killer The eunuch priest (Megabyzos) who had welcomed Arsino√´ on her arrival at the temple as \\"queen\\" was only pardoned when an embassy from Ephesus made a petition to Cleopatra.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 15.89; Josephus, Contra Apion 2.57; inaccurate Appian, Civil Wars 5.9.34-36 and Cassius Dio Roman History 48.24.2  Year of birth  Arsino√´'s year of birth is generally regarded as being between 68 and 63 BC: The Encyclopedia Britannica cites 63 BC, making her 15 at the time of her uprising and defeat against Julius Caesar and 22 at her death,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arsinoe-IV while the researcher Alissa Lyon cites 68 BC making her 27 at her death.‚ÄúANP455: Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, 25 September 2014. http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14/2014/09/25/arsinoe-iv/ Joyce Tyldesley places her birth date as between 68 and 65 BC.Joyce Tyldesley: Cleopatra, Last Queen of Egypt, Profile Books Ltd, 2008, p. 27. An alternate hypothesis was in the docudrama \\"Cleopatra: Portrait of a Killer\\", in which it was alleged a headless skeleton of a female child between the ages of 15 and 18 may be Arsino√´.‚ÄúCleopatra: Portrait of a Killer‚Äù, BBC, 2009. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00jhv9g Her actions in the brief war against Caesar naturally suggest that she was older than that and thus, would make it impossible for her to be the headless female child buried in the tomb. Perhaps the strongest evidence that she was in fact exercising her own authority is that Caesar, after the Pharos debacle, was prepared to release Ptolemy XIII ‚Äî a male, who continued the war against Caesar ‚Äî just to get his hands on her.‚ÄúDangerous Women‚Äù, Karen Murdarasi, 2016Cassius Dio, Roman History, vols 42-43 Stacy Schiff, who places Arsino√´'s age at around seventeen during the events of 48-47 BC, notes that Arsino√´ \\"burned with ambition\\" and was \\"not the kind of girl who inspired complacency,\\" writing that once Arsino√´ escaped the royal palace she became more vocal against her half-sister and that she assumed her position as head of the army alongside anti-Caesar courtier Achillas.Stacy Schiff: Cleopatra: A Life, Little, Brown and Company, 2010, pp. 48-49 Tomb at Ephesus In the 1990s, an octagonal monument situated in the centre of Ephesus was hypothesized by Hilke Th√ºr of the Austrian Academy of Sciences to be the tomb of Arsino√´. Although no inscription remains on the tomb, it was dated to between 50 and 20 BC. In 1926 the headless skeleton of a female estimated to be between the ages of 15‚Äì18 years at the time of her death was found in the burial chamber.Josef Keil (1929) Excavations In Ephesos Th√ºr's identification of the skeleton was based on the shape of the tomb, which was octagonal, like the second tier of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the carbon dating of the bones (between 200 ‚Äì 20 BC), the gender of the skeleton, and the age of the child at death.Dr. Fabian Kanz, \\"Arsinoe IV of Egypt: Sister of Cleopatra identified?\\" April 2009http://insidecatholic.com/Joomla/index.php?option=com_myblog&show;=The- BBC-invents-its-own-Cleopatra..html&Itemid;=102 It was also claimed that the tomb boasts Egyptian motifs, such as \\"papyri-bundle\\" columns. A DNA test was also attempted to determine the identity of the child. However, it was impossible to get an accurate reading since the bones had been handled too many times, and the skull had been lost in Germany during World War II. Hilke Th√ºr examined the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull,Cleopatra's mother 'was African' - BBC (2009) which was reconstructed using computer technology by forensic anthropologist Caroline Wilkinson to show what the woman may have looked like. Th√ºr alleged that it shows signs of African and Egyptian ancestry mixed with classical Grecian features ‚Äì despite the fact that Boas, Gravlee, Bernard and Leonard, and others have demonstrated that skull measurements are not a reliable indicator of race,Clarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard. \\"Heredity, Environment, and Cranial Form: A Re-Analysis of Boas‚Äôs Immigrant Data\\" American Anthropologist 105[1]:123‚Äì136, 2003. and the measurements were jotted down in 1920 before modern forensic science took hold. Furthermore, Arsino√´ and Cleopatra, shared the same father (Ptolemy XII Auletes) but had different mothers,The Lives of Cleopatra and Octavia, By Sarah Fielding, Christopher D. Johnson, p. 154, Bucknell University Press, with Th√ºr claiming the alleged African ancestry came from the skeleton's mother. Mary Beard wrote a dissenting essay criticizing the findings, pointing out that first, there is no surviving name on the tomb and that the claim the tomb is alleged to invoke the shape of the Pharos Lighthouse \\"doesn't add up\\"; second, the skull doesn't survive intact and the age of the skeleton is too young to be that of Arsino√´'s (the bones said to be that of a 15-18 year old, with Arsino√´ being around her mid twenties at her death); and thirdly, since Cleopatra and Arsino√´ were not known to have the same mother, \\"the ethnic argument goes largely out of the window.\\" Furthermore, craniometry as used by Th√ºr to determine race is based in scientific racism that is now generally considered a pseudoscience that supported \\"exploitation of groups of people\\" to \\"perpetuate racial oppression\\" and \\"distorted future views of the biological basis of race.\\" A writer from The Times described the identification of the skeleton as \\"a triumph of conjecture over certainty\\".http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5931845.ece If the monument is the tomb of Arsino√´, she would be the only member of the Ptolemaic dynasty whose remains have been recovered.Hilke Th√ºr: Arsino√´ IV, eine Schwester Kleopatras VII, Grabinhaberin des Oktogons von Ephesos?

Newhouse School of Public Communications is the communications school at Syracuse University. It has programs in print and broadcast journalism; music business; graphic design; advertising; public relations; and television and film. The school was named for publishing magnate Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr., who provided the founding gift in 1964. Mark J. Lodato is dean of the Newhouse School. The school includes about 80 full-time faculty members and about 50 adjunct instructors. Enrollment includes some 1,900 undergraduate students; 200 graduate students; 200 online master's degree students; and 13 doctoral degree candidates. Undergraduate admissions are highly selective. In December 2011, NewsPro ranked Newhouse as the top journalism school in the country.  History  Newhouse 1, Designed by alt= The Department of Journalism was established at Syracuse University in 1919. It became the School of Journalism in 1934. That year, Syracuse University became the first university in the nation to offer a college credit radio course. In 1947, SU launched WAER, one of the nation's first college radio stations. With the emergence of television, SU was the first to offer instruction in the field. In 1964, supported by a gift from Samuel I. Newhouse, the Newhouse Communications Complex was officially inaugurated in Newhouse 1, an award- winning building designed by architect I. M. Pei, which housed the School of Journalism. A year later, the building would be cited as one of the top four honor award winners of the American Institute of Architects. The building was dedicated by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who delivered his famous \\"Gulf of Tonkin Speech\\" on the Newhouse Plaza. In 1971, the School of Journalism merged with the Department of Television-Radio and was renamed the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. A second building, Newhouse 2, was dedicated in 1974 with a keynote address by William S. Paley, chairman of the board of CBS. In 2003, the Newhouse School received a $15 million gift from the S.I. Newhouse Foundation and the Newhouse family to fund the construction of the third building in the Newhouse Communications Complex. The $31.6 million modern structure, designed by the former Polshek Partnership, features the First Amendment etched in six-foot-high letters on its curving glass windows. Newhouse 3 was dedicated on September 19, 2007, with a keynote address from Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts Jr. The event was attended by the Newhouse family. In September 2014, the school completed an $18 million renovation of the Newhouse 2 building, creating the Newhouse Studio and Innovation Center, which features Dick Clark Studios, the Alan Gerry Center for Media Innovation and the Diane and Bob Miron Digital News Center. Oprah Winfrey attended and spoke at the dedication ceremony. In July 2015, the Newhouse School began offering an Online Master's in Communications, Communications@Syracuse. In January 2020, Donald E. Newhouse donated $75 million to the School through the Newhouse Foundation.  Student Activities  Most Newhouse students participate in extracurricular activities to gain experience in their chosen field of study. On-campus publications include The Daily Orange, an independent student-run newspaper; The Newshouse, an online news site; and numerous magazines. The university has three radio stations on campus: WJPZ, a Top 40 station that broadcasts to the Syracuse market; WERW, a free-format station; and WAER, one of the two NPR stations in Syracuse, which has an entirely student-run sports department. On-campus television stations include Orange Television Network and CitrusTV, the largest entirely student- run campus TV station in the country. Newhouse student-run agencies include Hill Communications (public relations) and TNH (advertising). There are also a number of diversity-based organizations for students, including the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.  Study Abroad  The Newhouse School offers multiple study abroad opportunities in addition to the SU Abroad program offered by the University. Newhouse students have the ability to work in Dubai, India, and France annually, and the London SU Abroad center offers classes directed by Newhouse.  Olympics  NBC, which owns the rights to Olympic television coverage in the United States, visits campus to recruit Newhouse students for internships every two years. The corporation normally conducts on-campus interviews one year before the games. Twenty-three students covered the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro as paid interns for NBC.

It was founded in 1996 by Faris Sanabani, aide and press secretary of then Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Its editors include Editor-in-Chief Abdulaziz Oudha, Yemen Observer's feature writers are Abdulaziz Oudha, Faisal Darem. Since 1996, the Yemen Observer Publishing House has diversified dramatically from a single bi-weekly newspaper to a five-armed media institution, publishing both in English and in Arabic: Yemen Today. Yemen Today, Arabia Felix, Sports, and Spectrum are examples for the company's fast and successful expansion. Today, it has become the first English-speaking publishing house of the country, actively supporting Yemen in its socio- economic transition. It also launched magazine Yemen Today is the most dynamic branch of the Publishing House, promoting investment and tourism in Yemen, a country which has promising potential in this field. 2006 cartoon thumbnails and blasphemy trial On 4 February 2006, the Yemen Observer published two articles on Muslim reactions to the Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad. The articles were accompanied by photographs showing 20-30,000 Yemeni women demonstrating against the cartoons, and empty shelves in a Sana√° supermarket with a sign informing customers that Danish products had been withdrawn. Also included were crossed-out thumbnail images of three of the Danish cartoons. On 11 February 2006, former chief editor Mohammed Al-Asadi was arrested on charges of offending Islam. He was released on bail on 22 February 2006. In a trial that began on 23 February 2006, prosecution lawyers called for al-Asadi to be sentenced to death, for the paper to be closed and for all of its assets to be confiscated. Al-Asadi denied all charges and his defence team argued that the thumbnail images were accompanied by articles that condemned the cartoons and reported reactions from across the Islamic world. The prosecution claimed that the charges rested on the pictures alone, and that the accompanying articles should not be taken into account. After his release, Al- Asadi founded the Yemen Mirror. During the trial and for nearly six months afterward, the Yemen Observer had its license to publish suspended by Yemen's Ministry of Information, but its staff continued to produce material and publish it on the paper's website. Yemen's Youth Revolution The outbreak of the Youth Revolution in Yemen on 3 February 2011 affected the Yemen Observer, too. Particularly critical articles on the policy of Ali Abdullah Saleh and the often violent and brutal crackdowns on unarmed demonstrators brought trouble to the journalists.

Once it was one of the most important small kingdoms of South Arabia. The city seems to have been destroyed in the 7th century BCE by the king and Mukarrib of Saba' Karab El Watar, according to a Sabaean text that reports the victory in terms that attest to its significance for the Sabaeans. History bull head from Kingdom of Awsan. First impressions in the mid-1990s, based on ceramics found by M. Saad Ayoub at the unexcavated site, date a resurgence of the city to the end of the 2nd century BCE lasting until the beginning of the 1st century CE (which corresponds quite well to the epigraphic data attesting the only deified South Arabian king that was just the king of AwsƒÅn precisely around this time). About 160,000 m¬≤ were encircled by walls, and the foundations of dwellings built of fired brick have been noted. Culture depended on annual flood irrigation in spring and summer, when flash floods down the wadis temporarily flooded the fields, leaving light silt that has since been wind- eroded, revealing the ancient patterns of fields and ditches. Radiocarbon dating of irrigation sediments in the environs suggest that essential irrigation was abandoned in the first half of the 1st century CE, and the population dispersed. This time the site was never rebuilt. ·∏§ajar Ya·∏•irr was the center of an exceptionally large city for South Arabia, influenced by Hellenistic culture, with temples and a palace structure surrounded by mudbrick dwellings, with a probable site for a souq or market and a caravanserai serving camel caravans.

It was conceived to be capable of performing the same roles as the earlier and highly successful Beaver, including as a bush plane, but is overall a larger aircraft. Design and development The rugged single- engined, high-wing, propeller-driven DHC-3 Otter was conceived in January 1951 by de Havilland Canada as a larger, more powerful version of its highly successful DHC2 Beaver STOL utility transport. Dubbed the \\"King Beaver\\" during design, it would be the veritable \\"one-ton truck\\" to the Beaver's \\"half-ton\\" role.Rossiter 1998, p. 55. The Otter received Canadian certification in November 1952 and entered production shortly thereafter. Using the same overall configuration as the Beaver, the new, much heavier design incorporated a longer fuselage, greater-span wing, and cruciform tail. Seating in the main cabin expanded from six to 10 or 11. Power was supplied by a 450-kW (600 hp) Pratt & Whitney R-1340 geared radial. The version used in the Otter was geared for lower propeller revolutions and consequently lower airspeed. The electrical system was 28 volts D.C. Like the Beaver, the Otter can be fitted with skis or floats. The Otter served as the basis for the very successful Twin Otter, which features two wing-mounted Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turboprops. A total of 466 Otters were manufactured.

It was used in Search and Rescue, as the \\"CSR\\" denotes Canadian Search (and) Rescue (type 123) and as a light utility transport, \\"CC\\" denoting Canadian Cargo. During the Suez Crisis, the Canadian government decided to provide assistance to the United Nations Emergency Force and the Royal Canadian Navy carrier carried 4 Otters from Halifax to Port Said in Egypt early in 1957, with all four flying off unassisted while the ship was at anchor. This was the only occasion when RCAF fixed wing aircraft operated from a Canadian warship. It was also operated on EDO floats on water and skis for winter operations on snow. The EDO floats also had wheels for use on runways (amphibious). It was used as army support dropping supplies by parachute, and also non-parachute low-speed, low-altitude air drops, to support the Canadian Army on manoeuvres. In the end it was operated by the Primary Air Reserve in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Winnipeg, with approximately 10 aircraft at each base, as well as by the RSU (Regular (Forces) Support Units) at those bases. It was usually flown with a single pilot (Commissioned Officer) in the left seat and a Technical Air Crewman (NCO) in the right seat. The Kiowa helicopter replaced it in Air Reserve squadrons. Although the Otter found ready acceptance in bush airlines, as in a similar scenario to the DHC-2 Beaver, the United States Army soon became the largest operator of the aircraft (184 delivered as the U-1A Otter). Other military users included Australia, Canada, and India, but the primary role of the aircraft as a rugged bush plane continues to this day. An Otter crossed the South Pole in 1957 (see Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition). The Otter is also popular in the skydiving community and can be found in many dropzones throughout the world. Otters were used by Qantas, from 1958 to 1960 in Papua New Guinea. The Qantas aircraft were then transferred to Trans Australian Airlines (TAA) a major Australian domestic airline which operated the Otters in Papua New Guinea until 1966 when they were withdrawn from use. TAA was merged with Qantas in 1990. Modifications The most extensively modified Otter was RCAF Otter 3682. After initial service as a standard Search and Rescue aircraft it was used to explore the aerodynamic aspects of STOL. In 1958 it was fitted with flaps so outsized that, with their 45 degree droop, it became known as the Batwing Otter. In addition, its tail-wheel undercarriage was replaced with a high energy- absorption 4-wheel arrangement and a very high vertical tail. The next modification replaced the flaps with fully retractable flaps suitable for cruising flight and high drag was obtained with reverse thrust from a J85 turbojet installed in the fuselage behind the cockpit. The third configuration looked a lot like the future Twin Otter and was the first twin-PT6 fixed-wing installation to fly in May 1963 (A twin PT6-engined helicopter, the Kaman K-1125, had flown in April 1963). The piston engine in the nose was replaced with wing-mounted engines to blow over the flaps.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1963/1963%20-%200073.html?search=january%20stol%20otterPower - The Pratt & Whitney Canada Story, Kenneth H.

Listed below are a select few of the most notable ones. *In 1956 two military Otters broke up in mid-air. One had taken off from Downsview and the other from Goose bay. The Otter needs tailplane deflection to balance the pitching moment caused by flap deflection. The flaps were held in position with hydraulic pressure balancing the air loads. Metal contamination in a hydraulic valve allowed the flaps to rapidly retract with the tailplane still fully trimmed. The consequent nose drop was severe enough to cause structural failure. A filter was added to the flap hydraulic system and an interconnection added between the flaps and tailplane to ensure a state of trim.Air Crash - The Clues In The Wreckage, Fred Jones 1985, Roobert Hale Ltd., , pp.104-112 Debris of 2015 crash near Ketchikan, Alaska *On 22 June 1994, a float equipped de Havilland DHC-3 Otter, N13GA, registered to and operated by Wings of Alaska of Juneau, Alaska, crashed into the Taku Inlet, 12 miles east of Juneau.

It is noted for its fern-like leaves and flamboyant display of orange-red flowers over summer. In many tropical parts of the world it is grown as an ornamental tree and in English it is given the name royal poinciana, flamboyant, flame of the forest, or flame tree (one of several species given this name). This species was previously placed in the genus Poinciana, named for Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, the 17th century governor of Saint Christopher (Saint Kitts). It is a non-nodulating legume.  Description  Frontal, lateral and backside view of a flower Gulmahor tree (Delonix regia) with flowers, Haridwar, India. Flower, leaves & pods (Kolkata, West Bengal, India) Delonix regia var. flavida is a rarer, yellow-flowered variety. Close-up of part of a leaf The flowers of Delonix regia are large, with four spreading scarlet or orange-red petals up to 8 cm long, and a fifth upright petal called the standard, which is slightly larger and spotted with yellow and white. They appear in corymbs along and at the ends of branches. The naturally occurring variety flavida (Bengali: Radhachura) has yellow flowers. The pods are green and flaccid when young and turn dark-brown and woody. They can be up to 60 cm long and 5 cm wide. The seeds are small, weighing around 0.4 g on average. The compound (doubly pinnate) leaves have a feathery appearance and are a characteristic light, bright green. Each leaf is 30‚Äì50 cm long with 20 to 40 pairs of primary leaflets or pinnae, each divided into 10‚Äì20 pairs of secondary leaflets or pinnules. Pollen grains are elongated, approximately 52 microns in size. Pollen grains of Delonix regia Distribution Flower (Kibbutz Ginnosar, Israel) Flowering tree (Island of Mauritius) Close up of bark Seed pods visible on upper branches (Gordonvale, Queensland, Australia) Delonix regia is endemic to the Madagascar's dry deciduous forests, but has been introduced into tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. In the wild it is endangered, but it is widely cultivated elsewhere and is regarded as naturalised in many of the locations where it is grown:  North America  In the continental United States, it grows in South Florida, Central Florida, and in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.  Caribbean and Central America  In the Caribbean it is featured in many Dominican and Puerto Rican paintings. It can also be found in Belize, The Bahamas, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, U.S. Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Jamaica and Cura√ßao. It is the national flower of St. Kitts and Nevis. It can also be found in Bermuda, Hawaii and Mexico, especially in the Yucatan peninsula. The town of Pe√±uelas, Puerto Rico, located about west of Ponce, is nicknamed \\"El Valle de los Flamboyanes\\" (\\"The Valley of the Poinciana Trees\\"), as many flamboyant trees are found along the surrounding R√≠o Guayanes, R√≠o Macana, and R√≠o Tallaboa rivers.  South America  It grows in Paraguay, Peru and throughout the whole of Brazil.  Europe and the Middle East  Delonix regia is planted in Mediterranean parts of Europe, the Middle east and North Africa, including the southern coast of Spain, the Valencian coast, the Canary Islands, Lebanon, Egypt, Israel and Jordan.  South Asia  A bonnet macaque eating flowers The tree is planted in India, where it is referred to as the May-flower tree, Gulmohar or Gul Mohr in West Bengal, Odisha, Bangalore and Sri Lanka. It is also grown in Karachi, Pakistan. In Mauritius and La R√©union it announces the coming of the new year.  Southeast Asia  In Myanmar, where it is called Sein-pann-ni, the time of flowering is March in the south and early to late April in the north. It is planted in gardens and as a roadside tree. In Myanmar, this tree is a sign of Thingyan Festival (Apr 13 - 16/17). In the Philippines, its flowering signals the imminent arrival of the monsoon rains. It also grows in Thailand and Indonesia and is the official tree in Vietnam. In that country, this tree is called \\"Ph∆∞·ª£ng v·ªπ\\", or phoenix's tail, and is a popular urban tree in much of Vietnam. Its flowering season is May‚ÄìJuly, which coincides with the end of the school year in Vietnam. Because of this timing, the flower of poinciana is sometimes called the \\"pupil's flower\\". The tree is also commonly found on school grounds in Vietnam, however after several trees fell down, with one student killed, schools started cutting down or severely pruning the trees. H·∫£i Ph√≤ng city is nicknamed \\"Th√†nh ph·ªë hoa ph∆∞·ª£ng ƒë·ªè\\" (\\"City of red poinciana\\").  East Asia  It grows in Southern China and Hong Kong. It is the official tree in Tainan, Taiwan; Xiamen, Fujian Province, People's Republic of China (PRC); and Shantou, Canton Province, (PRC). National Cheng Kung University, a university located in Tainan, put royal poinciana on its emblem.  Australia  It is very widely grown in the Northern Australia, the southern extremes previously limited to South East Queensland where it is a popular street tree in the suburbs of Brisbane. It now grows and blooms successfully in Sydney and other parts of New South Wales.  Micronesia  It grows in Guam, and is the official tree of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Cultivation Required conditions The royal poinciana requires a tropical or near-tropical climate, but can tolerate drought and salty conditions. It prefers an open, free-draining sandy or loamy soil enriched with organic matter. The tree does not like heavy or clay soils and flowers more profusely when kept slightly dry. Propagation =Seeds= Seeds after soaking them in water for 6 days The royal poinciana is most commonly propagated by seeds. Seeds are collected, soaked in warm water for at least 24 hours, and planted in warm, moist soil in a semi-shaded, sheltered position. In lieu of soaking, the seeds can also be 'nicked' or 'pinched' (with a small scissors or nail clipper) and planted immediately. These two methods allow moisture to penetrate the tough outer casing, stimulating germination. The seedlings grow rapidly and can reach 30 cm in a few weeks under ideal conditions. =Cuttings= Less common, but just as effective, is propagation by semi-hardwood cuttings. Branches consisting of the current or last season's growth can be cut into 30 cm sections and planted in a moist potting mixture. This method is slower than seed propagation (cuttings take a few months to root) but is the preferred method for ensuring new trees are true to form. As such, cuttings are a particularly common method of propagation for the rarer yellow-flowering variety of the tree. Usefulness In addition to its ornamental value, it is also a useful shade tree in tropical conditions, because it usually grows to a modest height (mostly 5 meters, but it can reach a maximum height of 12 meters) but spreads widely, and its dense foliage provides full shade. In areas with a marked dry season, it sheds its leaves during the drought, but in other areas it is virtually evergreen.

There is a popular belief among Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala that when Jesus was crucified, there was a small royal poinciana tree nearby his Cross. It is believed that the blood of Jesus Christ was shed over the flowers of the tree and this is how the flowers of royal poinciana got a sharp red color. It is also known as Vaaga in many areas of Kerala. Flame Trees, the iconic ballad by Australian Rock music band Cold Chisel is said to have been inspired by a preponderance of poinciana trees, however this is incorrect. The Flame trees reference in the song applies to the native Australian Flame Tree (Brachychiton acerifolius). Its blossom is the national flower of St. Kitts and Nevis, and in May 2018 the royal poinciana was adopted by the city of Key West as its official tree.https://www.flkeysnews.com/news/local/article211245829.html Known locally as semarak api, Delonix regia is the city flower of Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. The song Poinciana was inspired by the presence of this tree in Cuba.

At the , St Albans and the surrounding area had a population of 305 people. History The \\"Village of Macdonald\\" was surveyed in 1837 but renamed St Albans on 26 January 1841 after the City of St Albans in Hertfordshire, England, north of London. In the early part of the colonial settlement of New South Wales, the Macdonald Valley was an important agricultural area because of its accessibility by water. However, with the development of railways and extensive agricultural development west of the Great Dividing Range, the Macdonald Valley became less important and declined into a remote backwater. The valley is often referred to by the locals as the \\"Forgotten Valley\\". St Albans is on the banks of the Macdonald River, a tributary of the Hawkesbury River which is about 15 kilometres (9.5 mi) to the south. The village was opened for settlement in 1842 largely because it had become an important stopping point for farmers and others in the area wanting to ship their goods down the Hawkesbury River to Sydney. St Albans was at the navigational upper limit of the Macdonald River. This upper portion of the river has since been drastically reduced to navigation with sand and silt. Ferry and road access Two (free) 24-hour car ferries provide access to St Albans from the Sydney region along roads following the old goat and horse tracks on either side of the Macdonald. Both roads meander (one partly unsealed) through rich country and farms of cattle, melons, orchards and corn. On either side of the river are historic homes and spectacular sandstone towering hills. A route is through Wisemans Ferry township and north across the Hawkesbury via Wisemans ferry, then follow the eastern side of the Macdonald. The first bridge to cross the river links the two roads at St Albans. Another route to St Albans is to turn left just before entering Wisemans Ferry township, cross the Hawkesbury via the Webbs Creek Ferry, then follow up the western side of the Macdonald to the village. Churches and cemetery St Albans Anglican Church The St Albans Anglican Church (Saint Alban The Martyr), near the top of Wharf Road is the only church still in use. A timber chapel, opened in 1843, was replaced by the current stone building in 1897.http://www.hawkesbury.net.au/activities/c17.html Another interesting stone church remaining in the village is the old Wesleyan Methodist church in Espie Street. This was built in 1902 and is now in private hands, a reminder of almost 150 years of Wesleyan influence in the Macdonald valley. The funerals of those close to town usually progressed by boat to the old St Albans Burial Ground, a few kilometres south of the village beside the river, founded in 1826. This site had in the past suffered much by neglect, floods and vandalism but is now preserved. Historic buildings Two sites in St Albans are listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register: * 181 Main Road: MacDonald River bridge * 37 Upper Macdonald Road: Price Morris Cottage Other historic sites include: * The Court House and Police lockup built in 1890http://www.courthousestalbans.com.au/facilities.html The Court House is perched on wooded slopes of Hawkesbury sandstone, high above the beautiful Macdonald River and St Albans. The building, originally consisting of a courtroom, police station and lock-up, now offers comfortable overnight and holiday accommodation. The original prisoners' exercise yard is now a recreational area. The two original cells have been retained as unique bathrooms. The building is recognised by the National Trust and has a City of Hawkesbury heritage classification. * The Settlers Arms Inn (Originally known as Travellers Rest)http://www.saintalbans.org.au/ The inn occupies a picturesque position facing the river and is in an excellent state of preservation. In July 1842 the first land sales were held in St Albans. John Sullivan of Wollombi purchased seven allotments on which he built the Settlers Arms Inn. It was constructed at a cattle drover's camp on the limit of navigation on the Macdonald River. It still trades as \\"a purveyor of conversation, beer, and accommodation\\". There is some confusion as to the construction date. 1836 was the year the license was issued, number. 36/10, but a report by the Hawkesbury correspondent in the ‚Äò‚ÄôSydney Morning Herald‚Äô‚Äô on 1 March 1848 reads: \\"The township which a few years ago was marked out upon this river, has been built on by only one individual, Mr. Sullivan. He has erected a very reasonable stone house two stories high, which we understand he intends to open as an Inn.\\" [Implying that it was not open then.]. * Price Morris Cottage 1837http://www.pricemorris.com.au/history.htmhttp://www.pricemorris.com.au/ The newly restored 1837 cottage took 8 years to build and 2 years to restore. It has vertical timber slab, wattle and daub construction with its calico ceilings under a shingle roof. Price Morris, an emancipist/farmer took up the 50 acre (20 hectare) property grant in 1837. In the 1830s the area was settled by Welsh Methodists and the Price Morris cottage became the centre for Methodist meetings and worship. A Methodist church was built in St. Albans but the cottage continued as an occasional meeting place until the late 1960s. One of preachers was the grandfather of the late Sir Alan Walker, founder of the Central Methodist Mission. Floods Road bridge at St Albans There were devastating floods in 1867, 1889, 1913, and particularly 1949. The town lies fifty feet above the riverbed and the floor of the bridge is forty feet from the sand. In the 1889 flood the bridge was covered, the Court House was not washed away but the Police quarters were. The water rose to the eaves of Jurds Hotel (Settlers Arms Inn) and left a hole seven feet deep in front of it. The old house was of stone, but some of it washed away. The floodwaters rose to the veranda eaves and washed away five houses, and another newly built on the other side of the river.

A chute is a vertical or inclined plane, channel, or passage through which objects are moved by means of gravity. Landform A chute, also known as a race, flume, cat, or river canyon, is a steep-sided passage through which water flows rapidly. Akin to these, man-made chutes, such as the timber slide and log flume, were used in the logging industry to facilitate the downstream transportation of timber along rivers. These are no longer in common use. Man-made chutes may also be a feature of spillways on some dams. Some types of water supply and irrigation systems are gravity fed, hence chutes. These include aqueducts, puquios, and acequias. Building chute Chutes are in common use in tall buildings to allow the rapid transport of items from the upper floors to a central location on one of the lower floors or basement. Chutes may be round, square or rectangular at the top and/or the bottom. * Laundry chutes in hotels are placed on each floor to allow the expedient transfer and collection of dirty laundry to the hotel's laundry facility without having to use elevators or stairs. In stories, laundry chutes are commonly used for the protagonist to quickly escape, the laundry at the chute's base often serving to cushion the hero's fall. These chutes are generally aluminized steel and welded together to avoid any extruding parts that may rip or damage the materials. : Home laundry chutes are placed on each floor of multistory homes allow the collection of all household members' dirty laundry to one location, conveniently next to the laundry facilities, without the constant transport of laundry bins from story- to-story or room-to-room or up and down stairs.

Often the bottom end of the chute is placed directly above a large waste container. This makes garbage collection faster and more efficient. * Mail chutes are used in some buildings to collect the occupants' mail. A notable example is the Asia Insurance Building. * Escape chutes are used and proposed for use in evacuation of mining equipment and high-rise buildings. * Construction chutes are used to remove rubble and similar demolition materials safely from taller buildings. These temporary structures typically consist of a chain of cylindrical or conical plastic tubes, each fitted into the top of the one below and tied together, usually with chains. Together they form a long flexible tube, which is hung down the side of the building. The lower end of this tube is placed over a skip or other receptacle, and waste materials are dropped into the top. Heavy duty steel chutes may also be used when the debris being deposited is heavy duty and in cases of particularly high buildings. An elevator is not a chute as it is not moved by means of gravity.

Wynyard Park is bounded by York, Carrington, Margaret and Wynyard Streets. Surrounded by modern high-rise buildings it is one of the most densely built-up and intensively used parks in Sydney. Entrances to Wynyard railway station are located on the north-eastern and north-western corners of the park. Wynyard Park is the site of the first military barracks in Australia, the present park having its location, form and dimensions from the space of the original parade ground that the barracks occupied. The site is one Australia's oldest parks to be continuously set aside as open space for public use in an urban context. The park has maintained its role as an open square for public meetings, political protests, entertainment, assembly and passive recreation since its dedication as a public park in 1887. Wynyard Park is a popular place for office workers to eat lunch. Also, many bus services to the northern suburbs originate their journeys in the streets bordering the park.  History  The space which is now Wynyard Park was originally the parade ground of the first military barracks established shortly after the European colonisation of Sydney in 1788. It was from the park that the New South Wales Corps marched to arrest Governor Bligh in 1808, an event later known as the Rum Rebellion. Following the 1848 completion of Victoria Barracks, the barracks site was subdivided and private dwellings and shops were developed. Provision was made for a square to remain on the higher part of the former Barrack Square. From 1848-1887 the area was known as Wynyard Square, named after General Wynyard, Commander of British Forces in Australia, from 1848 to 1853. The square was dedicated as a recreation ground in 1875 and fenced and landscaped. Like similar squares in England its use was confined to residents who held keys to the gates, although by 1907 the American trend of removing fences around parks had been copied here. The original George Street military barracks were much larger in area, extending from Barrack Street in the south to almost Jamieson Street in the north, and extending west to Clarence Street Also in the 1880s a bus terminus was established for passengers from the southern suburbs, beginning the area‚Äôs long association with public transport. The building of a railway station here was first suggested in 1881 but it was 1932 before Wynyard Station opened. The square was dedicated as a public park in 1887 and the following year a bandstand was erected in the centre of the park. The park's most significant period was 1890 to 1910 when it was well planned and established. Its layout reflects this late Victorian Period in its landscape design. Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis (1835-1849) and the Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens Charles Moore (1848-1896), influenced the design of the park. From 1887 it became known as Wynyard Park. When the Sydney underground railways (now part of the Sydney Trains network) were constructed in 1927, Wynyard railway station was constructed by excavating the park and then rebuilding the park after the station had been constructed.  Description  At the northern end of the park is a statue by Giovanni Fontana from 1890 of the Reverend J. D. Lang, the Presbyterian minister and controversialist, lived at Wynyard Square and was responsible for the erection of the Scots Church in 1826. His statue is close to the Church, formerly the main Presbyterian church in central Sydney. The ornate underground men‚Äôs lavatory with a domed glass roof was built in 1912 and is similar to others at Hyde Park, Taylor Square and Macquarie Place Park. The park includes mature border plantings of Moreton Bay Figs (Flindersia Australis) and Plane trees, an Art Nouveau toilet block including fences, signs and lights, and sandstone walls.

Bruck is located on the Graz to Vienna main line, and is an important regional rail junction. History The earliest surviving record of Bruck dates from the time of King Ludovicus II \\"Germanicus\\", when it was identified, in a record dated 20 November 860, as \\"ad pruccam\\", a manor of the archbishopric of Salzburg.

Wahroonga shares the postcode of 2076 with the adjacent suburbs of Normanhurst and North Wahroonga. History Wahroonga is an Aboriginal word meaning our home, probably from the Kuringgai language group. In the early days of the British colonisation of New South Wales, the main activity was cutting down the tall trees which grew there. Wahroonga was first colonised by the British in 1822 by Thomas Hyndes, a convict who became a wealthy landowner. Hyndes's land was later acquired by John Brown, a merchant and timber-getter. After Brown had cleared the land of timber, he planted orchards. Later, Ada, Lucinda and Roland Avenues were named after three of his children.Ku Ring Gai Historical Society His name is in Browns Road, Browns Field and Browns Waterhole on the Lane Cove River. The last member of the Brown family was Gertrude Mary Appleton, who died in 2008 at the age of ninety-three. She is buried in the cemetery of St John the Baptist Church, Gordon. After the North Shore railway line was opened in 1890 it became a popular place for wealthy businessmen to build out-of-town residences with large gardens.

Their macroscopic behavior thus displays the spatial or temporal scale-invariance characteristic of the critical point of a phase transition, but without the need to tune control parameters to a precise value, because the system, effectively, tunes itself as it evolves towards criticality. The concept was put forward by Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld (\\"BTW\\") in a paper Papercore summary: http://papercore.org/Bak1987. published in 1987 in Physical Review Letters, and is considered to be one of the mechanisms by which complexity arises in nature. Its concepts have been applied across fields as diverse as geophysics, physical cosmology, evolutionary biology and ecology, bio-inspired computing and optimization (mathematics), economics, quantum gravity, sociology, solar physics, plasma physics, neurobiology and others. SOC is typically observed in slowly driven non-equilibrium systems with many degrees of freedom and strongly nonlinear dynamics. Many individual examples have been identified since BTW's original paper, but to date there is no known set of general characteristics that guarantee a system will display SOC.  Overview  Self- organized criticality is one of a number of important discoveries made in statistical physics and related fields over the latter half of the 20th century, discoveries which relate particularly to the study of complexity in nature. For example, the study of cellular automata, from the early discoveries of Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann through to John Conway's Game of Life and the extensive work of Stephen Wolfram, made it clear that complexity could be generated as an emergent feature of extended systems with simple local interactions. Over a similar period of time, Beno√Æt Mandelbrot's large body of work on fractals showed that much complexity in nature could be described by certain ubiquitous mathematical laws, while the extensive study of phase transitions carried out in the 1960s and 1970s showed how scale invariant phenomena such as fractals and power laws emerged at the critical point between phases. The term self-organized criticality was firstly introduced by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld's 1987 paper, which clearly linked together those factors: a simple cellular automaton was shown to produce several characteristic features observed in natural complexity (fractal geometry, pink (1/f) noise and power laws) in a way that could be linked to critical-point phenomena. Crucially, however, the paper emphasized that the complexity observed emerged in a robust manner that did not depend on finely tuned details of the system: variable parameters in the model could be changed widely without affecting the emergence of critical behavior: hence, self- organized criticality. Thus, the key result of BTW's paper was its discovery of a mechanism by which the emergence of complexity from simple local interactions could be spontaneous--and therefore plausible as a source of natural complexity--rather than something that was only possible in artificial situations in which control parameters are tuned to precise critical values. The publication of this research sparked considerable interest from both theoreticians and experimentalists, producing some of the most cited papers in the scientific literature. Due to BTW's metaphorical visualization of their model as a \\"sandpile\\" on which new sand grains were being slowly sprinkled to cause \\"avalanches\\", much of the initial experimental work tended to focus on examining real avalanches in granular matter, the most famous and extensive such study probably being the Oslo ricepile experiment. Other experiments include those carried out on magnetic-domain patterns, the Barkhausen effect and vortices in superconductors. Early theoretical work included the development of a variety of alternative SOC-generating dynamics distinct from the BTW model, attempts to prove model properties analytically (including calculating the critical exponents ), and examination of the conditions necessary for SOC to emerge. One of the important issues for the latter investigation was whether conservation of energy was required in the local dynamical exchanges of models: the answer in general is no, but with (minor) reservations, as some exchange dynamics (such as those of BTW) do require local conservation at least on average. In the long term, key theoretical issues yet to be resolved include the calculation of the possible universality classes of SOC behavior and the question of whether it is possible to derive a general rule for determining if an arbitrary algorithm displays SOC. Alongside these largely lab-based approaches, many other investigations have centered around large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display scale-invariant behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including: earthquakes (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter law describing the statistical distribution of earthquake size, and the Omori law describing the frequency of aftershocks ); solar flares; fluctuations in economic systems such as financial markets (references to SOC are common in econophysics); landscape formation; forest fires; landslides; epidemics; neuronal avalanches in the cortex; 1/f noise in the amplitude of electrophysiological signals; and biological evolution (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of \\"punctuated equilibria\\" put forward by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould). These \\"applied\\" investigations of SOC have included both modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system) and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws. In addition, SOC has been applied to computational algorithms. Recently, it has been found that the avalanches from an SOC process, like the BTW model, make effective patterns in a random search for optimal solutions on graphs. An example of such an optimization problem is graph coloring. The SOC process apparently helps the optimization from getting stuck in a local optimum without the use of any annealing scheme, as suggested by previous work on extremal optimization. The recent excitement generated by scale-free networks has raised some interesting new questions for SOC-related research: a number of different SOC models have been shown to generate such networks as an emergent phenomenon, as opposed to the simpler models proposed by network researchers where the network tends to be assumed to exist independently of any physical space or dynamics. While many single phenomena have been shown to exhibit scale-free properties over narrow ranges, a phenomenon offering by far a larger amount of data is solvent-accessible surface areas in globular proteins. These studies quantify the differential geometry of proteins, and resolve many evolutionary puzzles regarding the biological emergence of complexity. Despite the considerable interest and research output generated from the SOC hypothesis, there remains no general agreement with regards to its mechanisms in abstract mathematical form. Bak Tang and Wiesenfeld based their hypothesis on the behavior of their sandpile model. However, it has been argued that this model would actually generate 1/f2 noise rather than 1/f noise. This claim was based on untested scaling assumptions, and a more rigorous analysis showed that sandpile models generally produce 1/fa spectra, with a<2\\\\. Other simulation models were proposed later that could produce true 1/f noise, and experimental sandpile models were observed to yield 1/f noise. In addition to the nonconservative theoretical model mentioned above, other theoretical models for SOC have been based upon information theory , mean field theory , the convergence of random variables , and cluster formation. A continuous model of self-organised criticality is proposed by using tropical geometry.

The eastern peaks of the range were the traditional territory of the Wonnarua people. Geography The Liverpool Range starts from the volcanic plateau known as the Barrington Tops and runs for about westwards, forming the northern boundary of the Hunter Region. Parts of the Liverpool Range form the watershed between the coastal and inland drainage of New South Wales and thus form a component of the Great Dividing Range. The western end of the Liverpool Range merges into the Warrumbungle Range. The Liverpool Range has a reputation as a breeding ground for severe summer thunderstorms. The peaks of the range generally experience several snowfalls each winter. History The Liverpool Range was named after Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time of its exploration by Europeans. The higher parts of the Liverpool Range reach approximately above sea level, and the range formed a significant barrier to the expansion of settlement in the early period of British settlement in New South Wales. The first route across the range was Pandora's Pass discovered by Allan Cunningham. This is located near the western end of the range, north from the town of Coolah and within Coolah Tops National Park. The crossing used by the New England Highway is Nowlands Gap (otherwise known as Murrurundi Gap), which crosses the range near its east end. The railway from Newcastle to Werris Creek crosses under this pass via Ardglen Tunnel. The southern slopes of the Liverpool Range are drained by the headwaters of the Hunter River and its tributaries, such as the Pages River, which flows through the town of Murrurundi. The northern slopes are drained by the headwaters of the Peel River and the Mooki River. The Talbragar River and the Coolaburragundy River also rise on the range and flow south-west, joining near the town of Dunedoo.
