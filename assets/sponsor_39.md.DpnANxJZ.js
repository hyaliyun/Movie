Usually stationed in air traffic control centers and control towers on the ground, they monitor the position, speed, and altitude of aircraft in their assigned airspace visually and by radar, and give directions to the pilots by radio. The position of air traffic controller is one that requires highly specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities. Controllers apply separation rules to keep aircraft at a safe distance from each other in their area of responsibility and move all aircraft safely and efficiently through their assigned sector of airspace, as well as on the ground. Because controllers have an incredibly large responsibility while on duty (often in aviation, \\"on position\\") and make countless real-time decisions on a daily basis, the ATC profession is consistently regarded around the world as one of the most mentally challenging careers, and can be notoriously stressful depending on many variables (equipment, configurations, weather, traffic volume, traffic type, special activities, governmental actions, human factors). Many controllers, however, would cite high salaries, and a very large, unique, and privileged degree of autonomy as major advantages of their jobs. Although the media in the United States frequently refers to them as air controllers, or flight controllers, most air traffic professionals use the term air traffic controllers, ATCOs, or controllers. For a more detailed article on the job itself, see air traffic control. Features of the job =Core skills of a controller= Air traffic controllers are generally individuals who are well organized, are quick with numeric computations and mathematics, have assertive and firm decision-making skills, are able to maintain their composure under pressure, and possess an excellent short-term memory. Through numerous studies throughout the decades, it has been demonstrated that traffic controllers usually have a superior visual memory, and in addition, studies have shown that air traffic controllers generally have a degree of situational awareness that is significantly better than the population average. In 'games' involving short-term memory, peer-induced stresses, and real-time risk analysis, air traffic control specialists scored better than the control group in every experiment. Excellent hearing and speaking skills are a requirement, and trainees undergo rigorous physical and psychological testing. Moreover, the position of the air traffic controller requires some of the strictest medical and mental requirements for any profession in the world; conditions such as diabetes, epilepsy, heart disease, and many mental disorders (e.g., clinical depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, a history of drug abuse) almost always disqualify people from obtaining medical certification from the overseeing aviation authority. Almost universally, controllers are subjected to rigid medical and mental exams to ensure safety in the air traffic system. In the United States, for example, all air traffic controllers are required to take and pass a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory before being hired by the Federal Aviation Administration. Conditions such as hypertension, while not disqualifying, are taken seriously and must be monitored with medical examinations by certified doctors. Controllers must take precautions to remain healthy and avoid certain medications that are banned for them. Many drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) such as SSRI antidepressants and benzodiazepines, are banned. Almost universally, trainee controllers begin work in their twenties and retire in their fifties. This is due to an FAA requirement that trainees begin their training at the Academy no later than their 31st birthday, and face mandatory retirement at age 56.Clark, Anders (17 June 2015). \\"FAA Hiring Scandal Follow Up\\". Footnote 1. Disciples of Flight. Retrieved 24 September 2015. However, retired military air traffic controllers may qualify for appointment after reaching 31 years of age. Communication is a vital part of the job: controllers are trained to focus on the exact words that pilots and other controllers speak, because a single misunderstanding about altitude levels or runway numbers can have tragic consequences. Controllers communicate with the pilots of aircraft using a push-to-talk radiotelephony system which has many attendant issues, such as the fact that only one transmission can be made on a frequency at a time and can either merge or block each other and become unintelligible. Although local languages are used in ATC communications, the default language of aviation worldwide is English. Controllers who do not speak English as a first language are generally expected to show a certain minimum level of competency with the language. Controllers often work from a control tower like this one at Birmingham Airport, England =Area or en route= Area controllers are responsible for the safety of aircraft at higher altitudes, in the en route phase of their flight surrounding busier airports and airspace. Area controllers may also handle aircraft at lower altitudes as well as air traffic around small airports that do not have their own towers or approach controllers. In most nations they are known as \\"area,\\" \\"en route,\\" or, colloquially in the US, \\"center\\" controllers. Area controllers are responsible for specific sectors of 3D blocks of airspace with defined dimensions. Each sector is managed by at least one Area controller, known as an \\"R-side\\" controller that handles radio communications. During busier times of traffic there may also be a second Area controller, known as a \\"D-side\\", assigned to the same area in order to assist the R-side Area controller. This can be done with or without the use of radar: radar allows a sector to handle much more traffic; however, procedural control is used in many areas where traffic levels do not justify radar or the installation of radar is not feasible, such as over oceans. In the United States, En-Route controllers work at Air Route Traffic Control Centers or ARTCCs. In other countries, area controllers work in Area Control Centers, controlling high-level en-route aircraft, or Terminal Control Centers, which control aircraft climbing from or descending to major groups of airports. =Aerodrome or tower= Aerodrome or Tower controllers control aircraft within the immediate vicinity of the airport and use visual observation from the airport tower. The tower's airspace is often a radius around the airport, but can vary greatly in size and shape depending on traffic configuration and volume. The tower positions are typically split into many different positions such as Flight Data/Clearance Delivery, Ground Control, and Local Control (known as Tower by the pilots); at busier facilities, a limited radar approach control position may be needed. The roles of the positions are; * Flight Data/Clearance Delivery: Issues IFR flight plan clearances, obtains squawk codes for VFR aircraft, helps with coordination for GC/LC, and cuts the ATIS (weather). FD/CD is commonly known in the profession as the secretary of the tower. * Ground: Issues taxi instructions and authorizes aircraft/vehicle movements on the airport except the active runway(s); controllers are not responsible for aircraft movement on ramps or other designated non-movement areas. * Local (Tower): Issues takeoff and landing instructions/clearances and authorizes aircraft/vehicle movements on or across runways. * Approach: Issues instructions to aircraft who are intending to land at the airport. This involves vectoring aircraft in a safe, orderly, and expeditious manner and, if needed, stacking the aircraft at different holding altitudes. =Civilian/military ‚Äì public/private= Nimitz- class aircraft carrier (CVN-72). Civilian air traffic controllers, Memphis International Airport, 1962 Most countries' armed forces employ air traffic controllers, often in most if not all branches of the forces. Although actual terms vary from country to country, controllers are usually enlisted. In some countries, all air traffic control is performed by the military. In other countries, military controllers are responsible solely for military airspace and airbases; civilian controllers maintain airspace for civilian traffic and civilian airports. Historically, in most countries, this was part of the government and controllers were civil servants. However, many countries have partly or wholly privatized their air traffic control systems; others are looking to do the same. =Education= Civilian Air Traffic Controllers' licensing is standardized by international agreement through ICAO. Many countries have Air Traffic Control schools, academies or colleges, often operated by the incumbent provider of air traffic services in that country, but sometimes privately. These institutions are structured to provide training to individuals without any prior air traffic control experience. At the completion of academic training, the graduating student will be granted an Air Traffic Control license, which will include one or more Ratings. These are sub-qualifications denoting the air traffic control discipline or disciplines in which the person has been trained. ICAO defines five such ratings: Area (procedural), Area Radar, Approach (procedural), Approach Radar and Aerodrome. In the United States, controllers may train in several similar specialties: Tower, Ground-Controlled Approach (GCA), Terminal Radar Control, or En route Control (both radar and non-radar). This phase of training takes between 6 months and several years. Whenever an air traffic controller is posted to a new unit or starts work on a new sector within a particular unit, they must undergo a period of training regarding the procedures peculiar to that particular unit and/or sector. The majority of this training is done in a live position controlling real aircraft and is termed On the Job Training (OJT), with a fully qualified and trained mentor or On the Job Training Instructor (OJTI) also 'plugged into' the position to give guidance and ready to take over in a second should it become necessary. The length of this phase of training varies from a matter of months to years, depending on the complexity of the sector. Only once a person has passed all these training stages they will be allowed to control a position alone. =Work patterns= Typically, controllers work \\"on position\\" for 90 to 120 minutes followed by a 30-minute break. Except at quieter airports, air traffic control is a 24-hour, 365-day- a-year job where controllers usually work rotating shifts, including nights, weekends, and public holidays. These are usually set 28 days in advance. In many countries, the structure of controllers' shift patterns is regulated to allow for adequate time off. In the UK the most common pattern is two mornings, two late afternoons and two evenings/nights followed by a four-day break. With NATS, the minimum age to start the application and training is 18 while the mandatory retirement age is 56. If an 18-year-old joins and is successful then they will have to be posted to an Area course which will ensure they are 21 years old on graduation, thus old enough to hold a radar license. =Stress= Many countries regulate work hours to ensure that controllers are able to remain focused and effective. Research has shown that when controllers remain \\"on position\\" for more than two hours without a break, performance can deteriorate rapidly, even at low traffic levels. Many national regulations therefore require breaks at least every two hours. Sylvia Noble Tesh documented the stresses and challenges faced by air traffic controller's in her 1984 study \\"The politics of stress: the case of air traffic control.\\" published in the International journal of health services. =Computerization and the future= Despite years of effort and billions of dollars spent on computer software designed to assist air traffic control, success has been largely limited to improving the tools at the disposal of the controllers, such as computer-enhanced radar. It is likely that in the next few decades, future technology will make the controller more of a systems manager overseeing decisions made by automated systems and manually intervening to resolve situations not handled well by the computers, rather than being automated out of existence altogether. However, there are problems envisaged with technology that normally takes the controller out of the decision loop but requires the controller to step back in to control exceptional situations: air traffic control is a skill that has to be kept current by regular practice. This in itself may prove to be the largest stumbling block to the introduction of highly automated air traffic control systems. User acceptance or willingness to use such technology is another important consideration air service providers need to consider prior to implementing any new technology. In a recent study with over 500 air traffic controllers from around the world, Bekier and colleaguesBekier, M., Molesworth, B. R. C., & Williamson, A. (2012). Tipping point: the narrow path between automation acceptance and rejection in air traffic management. Safety Science, 50(2), 259‚Äì265. found that once the focus of decision-making shifts from the air traffic controller, support for the technology dramatically decreases. Unsurprisingly, they also found that air traffic controllers enjoy the core tasks of their role: namely, conflict detection and resolution.Bekier, M., Molesworth, B. R. C., & Williamson, A. (2011). Why air traffic controllers accept or refuse automated technology. Paper presented at the 16th International Symposium on Aviation Psychology, Dayton, OH. 2014 changes in the United States In 2014, it was reported that in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration had stopped giving preferential treatment to air-traffic controller applicants who had passed classes from the 36 FAA-approved college aviation programs across the United States, with some speculating it was due to too many white males being hired over minorities. The FAA says it ‚Äúis blind on the issue of diversity\\". At the same time, the FAA also stopped giving preference to applicants who were military veterans with aviation experience.https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-closes-a-hiring-runway-for-air- traffic-controllers-1400799866? tesla=y FAA Closes a Hiring Runway for Air- Traffic Controllers, Wall St. Journal, May 22, 2014Half of air traffic controller job offers go to people with no aviation experience, Chicago Tribune, July 30, 2014Trouble in the Skies , Fox Business, May 20, 2015 See also *Air traffic controllers' strike of 1981 (United States) *Aviation safety *Flight planning *The Guild of Air Traffic Control Officers References External links * Air Traffic Control Association * Unique Aviation Career as an Air Traffic Controller, by James Wynbrandt, Flying (magazine) Controller Combat support occupations Occupations in aviation Aviation licenses and certifications ","title":"Air traffic controller"},{"id":"242298","text":"The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle is, translated from Latin, the \\"lifter of both the upper lip and of the wing of the nose\\".

In humans, the upper jaw includes the hard palate in the front of the mouth.Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. The two maxillary bones are fused at the intermaxillary suture, forming the anterior nasal spine. This is similar to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at the mandibular symphysis. The mandible is the movable part of the jaw. Structure Inferior surface of maxilla In humans, the maxilla consists of: * the body of the maxilla * four processes ** the zygomatic process ** the frontal process of maxilla ** the alveolar process ** the palatine process * three surfaces ‚Äì anterior, posterior, medial * the Infraorbital foramen * the maxillary sinus * the incisive foramen =Articulations= Each maxilla articulates with nine bones: * two of the cranium: the frontal and ethmoid * seven of the face: the nasal, zygomatic, lacrimal, inferior nasal concha, palatine, vomer, and the adjacent fused maxilla. Sometimes it articulates with the orbital surface, and sometimes with the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid. =Development= Figure 5: Anterior surface of maxilla at birth. Figure 6: Inferior surface of maxilla at birth. The maxilla is ossified in membrane. Mall and Fawcett maintain that it is ossified from two centers only, one for the maxilla proper and one for the premaxilla. These centers appear during the sixth week of prenatal development and unite in the beginning of the third month, but the suture between the two portions persists on the palate until nearly middle life. Mall states that the frontal process is developed from both centers. The maxillary sinus appears as a shallow groove on the nasal surface of the bone about the fourth month of development, but does not reach its full size until after the second dentition. The maxilla was formerly described as ossifying from six centers, viz.: * One, the orbitonasal, forms that portion of the body of the bone which lies medial to the infraorbital canal, including the medial part of the floor of the orbit and the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. * A second, the zygomatic, gives origin to the portion which lies lateral to the infraorbital canal, including the zygomatic process. * From a third, the palatine, is developed the palatine process posterior to the incisive canal together with the adjoining part of the nasal wall. * A fourth, the premaxillary, forms the incisive bone which carries the incisor teeth and corresponds to the premaxilla of the lower vertebrates. * A fifth, the nasal, gives rise to the frontal process and the portion above the canine tooth. * And a sixth, the infravomerine, lies between the palatine and premaxillary centers and beneath the vomer; this center, together with the corresponding center of the opposite bone, separates the incisive canals from each other. Changes by age At birth the transverse and antero-posterior diameters of the bone are each greater than the vertical. The frontal process is well-marked and the body of the bone consists of little more than the alveolar process, the teeth sockets reaching almost to the floor of the orbit. The maxillary sinus presents the appearance of a furrow on the lateral wall of the nose. In the adult the vertical diameter is the greatest, owing to the development of the alveolar process and the increase in size of the sinus. Function Fracture of the left lacrimal / maxillary bone The alveolar process of the maxillae holds the upper teeth, and is referred to as the maxillary arch. Each maxilla attaches laterally to the zygomatic bones (cheek bones). Each maxilla assists in forming the boundaries of three cavities: * the roof of the mouth * the floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity * the wall of the orbit Each maxilla also enters into the formation of two fossae: the infratemporal and pterygopalatine, and two fissures, the inferior orbital and pterygomaxillary. -When the tender bones of the upper jaw and lower nostril are severely or repetitively damaged, at any age the surrounding cartilage can begin to deteriorate just as it does after death. Clinical significance A maxilla fracture is a form of facial fracture. A maxilla fracture is often the result of facial trauma such as violence, falls or automobile accidents. Maxilla fractures are classified according to the Le Fort classification. In other animals Sometimes (e.g. in bony fish), the maxilla is called \\"upper maxilla\\", with the mandible being the \\"lower maxilla\\". Conversely, in birds the upper jaw is often called \\"upper mandible\\". In most vertebrates, the foremost part of the upper jaw, to which the incisors are attached in mammals consists of a separate pair of bones, the premaxillae. These fuse with the maxilla proper to form the bone found in humans, and some other mammals. In bony fish, amphibians, and reptiles, both maxilla and premaxilla are relatively plate-like bones, forming only the sides of the upper jaw, and part of the face, with the premaxilla also forming the lower boundary of the nostrils. However, in mammals, the bones have curved inward, creating the palatine process and thereby also forming part of the roof of the mouth. Birds do not have a maxilla in the strict sense; the corresponding part of their beaks (mainly consisting of the premaxilla) is called \\"upper mandible\\". Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, also lack a true maxilla. Their upper jaw is instead formed from a cartilaginous bar that is not homologous with the bone found in other vertebrates.

He is computer-generated and is voiced by voice actor Andy Secombe. He is a mean-tempered, greedy Toydarian, and owner of a second-hand goods store in Mos Espa on the planet Tatooine. Among Watto's belongings are the slaves Shmi Skywalker and her son, Anakin. He acquires them after winning a podracing bet with Gardulla the Hutt, and he puts them both to work in his store. Anakin demonstrates an incredible aptitude for equipment repair, and Watto decides to profit from it by having the boy fix various broken equipment in the store. He eventually loses Anakin in a podracing bet with Qui-Gon Jinn when he bets on a competitor, Sebulba, who is defeated by Anakin. Concept and creation Design director Doug Chiang described Watto's design as \\"this conglomeration of odd things that really didn't fit, but that in the end gave him a very unique and powerful personality\\". While seeking the approval of George Lucas, Chiang put up an amalgalm of different concepts, including Terryl Whitlatch's pudgy parrot, Iain Craig's four armed beast with a cigar, and the head in an early Neimoidian picture by Chiang himself, featuring a hooked trunk and crooked teeth. Chiang added hummingbird wings to the Toydarian design, along with having Watto wear a vest and a tool belt, and Lucas approved, only asking for webbed feet and pants. Modeling supervisor Geoff Campell was skeptical of having a chubby alien with wings, so it was imagined that the Toydarians are filled with gas, making the wings only propel him instead of supporting his weight. Animation supervisor Rob Coleman realized that the alien's dental work would need some modification when the time came to create Watto on screen, as Watto's craggy teeth made lip-syncing difficult. To solve the problem, Coleman broke off one of Watto's incisors, giving him a \\"corner-of-the-mouth\\" vernacular. His expressions were based on video footage of voice actor Andy Secombe, photographs of Coleman imitating the character, and modeler Steve Alpin saying Watto's lines to a mirror. Alec Guinness performing as Fagin in Oliver Twist was used as an influence in the character's development. The sound of his wings flapping is a looped recording of sound designer Ben Burtt opening and closing an umbrella. Appearances Watto first appears in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, the first title chronologically in the Star Wars series. He has both an ability for haggling and a resistance to the \\"Jedi mind trick\\", a technique used to persuade people. He is both a junk dealer and slave owner on the planet Tatooine, possessing both Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin. When challenged to a bet for Anakin's freedom by Qui-Gon Jinn, Watto agrees. After Anakin beats Sebulba (whom Watto bets on), a competing racer that he challenged throughout the race he participated in, he was let go. Watto makes a final appearance in the sequel Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, which takes place 10 years after the original film, the now-adult Anakin returns to Tatooine to find his mother. Searching Mos Espa, he finds Watto sitting outside the shop at a small stall. Watto tells Anakin that he sold Shmi some years ago to a moisture farmer named Cliegg Lars, who freed and married her. Watto then takes Anakin and Padm√© to look through his records to find her. Watto makes multiple further appearances in the Star Wars Expanded Universe; one such appearance details his time on his home planet before he came to Tatooine during a war. It also tells how he sustained his broken tusk and disabled leg. He later learns his business savvy from the Jawas, native to the planet Tatooine. In the non-canonical Star Wars comic book Star Wars: Visionaries, Watto is shown to have been killed by Darth Maul (whose appearance here predates the canonical revelation of his survival of the events of The Phantom Menace) during Maul's process of tracking down his nemesis Obi-Wan Kenobi, to gain vengeance for his defeat during the Battle of Naboo. His son Blatto makes an appearance in the non-canonical television special Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars. Watto has also been produced as a Lego figure and featured in the Lego Star Wars video games, in addition to numerous other appearances in the form of collectibles and other merchandising. Reception Editors for IGN ranked Watto 78th in their list of Top 100 Star Wars characters. They wrote that he was \\"one of the most confusing scientific anomalies\\" due to \\"the idea that a creature so potbellied is able to stay afloat for so long\\". They added that he was \\"no prince\\" for his unscrupulous deals. In the book The Holy Family and Its Legacy, author Albrecht Koschorke discusses the presence of \\"The Holy Family\\" in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, stating that while there was no \\"solicitous guardian watching over the mother and the holy child,\\" Watto acts in a similar position as a \\"man who possesses patriarchal powers without being the father.\\" =Allegations of antisemitism= It has been suggested that this character is offensive because he resembles a stereotypical Jew, he has a large hooked nose, beady eyes, speaks in a gravelly voice, and is portrayed as greedy and covetous. In his second appearance, he also had a beard and wears a round black hat resembling a kippah. J. Hoberman of The Village Voice called him \\"the most blatant ethnic stereotype\\" due to his hooked nose. Bruce Gottlieb of Slate magazine criticized him as well, comparing his character to the antisemitic notion that the Jewish race is \\"behind the slave trade\\". Patricia J. Williams of The Nation stated that Watto was also described as a stereotype of Arabs, but that he was \\"more comprehensively anti-Semitic‚Äîboth anti-Arab and anti-Jew.\\" She added that Watto reminded her of an \\"anti-Semitic caricature published in Vienna at the turn of the 20th century.\\" Jane Prettyman of the American Review noted that after leaving the theater, she heard two young boys describe him as \\"that weird little Jew guy with wings\\". Prettyman described his depiction as \\"not at all subtle\\", and said that \\"it can be counted on to flush out already-formed Jew-haters among young audiences and give them permission to continue their hatred out loud.\\" Looking back on the character on the twentieth anniversary of the film, essayist Aaron Freedman both acknowledges the stereotypical aspects of the character while admitting that as a boy he empathized with Watto as \\"the only representation we Jews get in the Star Wars franchise,\\" suggesting that the portrayal of Watto as struggling to survive in a society shaped by forces beyond his control echoed that of both Jews throughout history and the Shakespearean character Shylock.

He served as Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and later concomitantly as Bishop of Oxford. Education Born at Longworth, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), the eldest son of Samuel Fell, who would himself be installed as Dean of Christ Church in 1638, and his wife Margaret n√©e Wylde, he received his early education at Lord Williams's School at Thame in Oxfordshire. In 1637 aged only 11 he became a student at Christ Church, and in 1640 because of his \\"known desert\\", he was specially allowed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, to proceed to his degree of BA when wanting one term's residence. He obtained his MA in 1643 and took Holy Orders (deacon 1647, priest 1649). English Civil War During the Civil War he bore arms for King Charles I of England and held a commission as ensign. In 1648 he was deprived of his studentship by the parliamentary visitors, and during the next few years he resided chiefly at Oxford with his brother-in- law, Thomas Willis, at whose house opposite Merton College he and his friends Richard Allestree and John Dolben kept up the service of the Church of England throughout the Commonwealth. Career John Fell. Portrait by Sir Peter Lely. After the Restoration, Fell was made prebendary of Chichester, canon of Christ Church (27 July 1660), dean (30 November), master of St Oswald's hospital, Worcester, chaplain to the king, and D.D. (see Doctor of Divinity). He filled the office of Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1666 to 1669, and was consecrated bishop of Oxford, in 1676, retaining his deanery in commendam. Some years later, he declined the Primacy of Ireland. Fell showed himself a capable administrator. He restored good order in the university by the archbishop, which during the Commonwealth had given place to a general disregard of authority. He ejected the intruders from his college or else \\"fixed them in loyal principles.\\" \\"He was the most zealous man of his time for the Church of England,\\" says Anthony Wood, \\"and none that I yet know of did go beyond him in the performance of the rules belonging thereunto.\\" He attended chapel four times a day, restored to the services, not without some opposition, the organ and surplice, and insisted on the proper academic dress which had fallen into disuse. He was active in recovering church property, and by his directions a children's catechism was drawn up by Thomas Marshall for use in his diocese. \\"As he was among the first of our clergy,\\" says Thomas Burnet, \\"that apprehended the design of bringing in popery, so he was one of the most zealous against it.\\" He made many converts from the Roman Catholics and Nonconformists. On the other hand, he successfully opposed the incorporation of Titus Oates as D.D. in the university in October 1679; and according to the testimony of William Nichols, his secretary, he disapproved of the Exclusion Bill. He excluded the undergraduates, whose presence had been irregularly permitted, from convocation. He obliged students to attend lectures, instituted reforms in the performances of the public exercises in the schools, kept the examiners up to their duties, was present in person at examinations. He encouraged the students to act plays. He entirely suppressed \\"coursing,\\" i.e. disputations in which the rival parties \\"ran down opponents in arguments,\\" and which commonly ended in blows and disturbances. =Discipline= He was a disciplinarian, and possessed a talent for the education of young men, many of whom he received into his own family. Tom Brown, author of The Dialogues of the Dead, about to be expelled from Oxford for some offence, was pardoned by Fell on the condition of his translating ex tempore the 32nd epigram of Martial: > To which he immediately replied with the well-known lines: > I do not like thee, Doctor Fell, The reason why I cannot tell; But this I > know, and know full well, I do not like thee, Dr Fell. Delinquents were not always treated thus mildly by Fell, and Acton Cremer, for the crime of courting a wife while only a bachelor of arts, was punished by having to translate into English the whole of Scheffer's history of Lapland. As Vice-Chancellor, Fell personally visited the drinking taverns and ordered out the students. In the university elections he showed great energy in suppressing corruption. =Building operations= Fell's building operations were ambitious. In his own college he completed in 1665 the north side of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey's great quadrangle, already begun by his father but abandoned during the Commonwealth; in 1672, he rebuilt the east side of the Chaplain's quadrangle \\"with a straight passage under it leading from the cloister into the field,\\" occupied now by the new Meadow Buildings; the lodgings of the canon of the third stall in the passage uniting the Tom Quad and Peckwater Quadrangle (c.1674); a long building joining the Chaplain's quadrangle on the east side in 1677‚Äì1678; and lastly the great Tom Tower gate, begun in June 1681 on the foundation laid by Wolsey and finished in November 1682, to which the bell \\"great Tom,\\" after being recast, was transferred from the cathedral in 1683. In 1670 he planted and laid out the Broad Walk. He spent large sums of his own on these works, gave ¬£500 for the restoration of Banbury church, erected a church at St Oswald's, Worcester, and the parsonage house at Woodstock at his own expense, and rebuilt Cuddesdon Palace. Fell disapproved of the use of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin for secular purposes, and promoted the building of the Sheldonian Theatre by Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon. He was treasurer during its construction, presided at the formal opening on 9 July 1669, and was nominated curator, along with Christopher Wren, in July 1670. =Oxford University Press= In the theatre was placed the Oxford University Press, the establishment of which had been a favourite project of Laud and now engaged a large share of Fell's energy and attention, and which as curator he practically controlled. \\"Were it not you ken Mr Dean extraordinarily well,\\" wrote Sir Leoline Jenkins to John Williamson in 1672, \\"it were impossible to imagine how assiduous and drudging he is about his press.\\" He sent for type and printers from Holland, declaring that \\"the foundation of all success must be laid in doing things well, which l am sure will not be done with English letters.\\" =Writings= Many works, including a Bible, editions of the classics and of the early fathers, were produced under Fell's direction and editing. He published annually one work, generally a classical author annotated by himself, which he distributed to all the students of his college on New Year's Day. On one occasion he surprised the Press in surreptitiously printing Pietro Aretino's Postures, and he seized and destroyed the plates and impressions. Ever \\"an eager defender and maintainer of the university and its privileges,\\" he was hostile to the Royal Society, which he regarded as a possible rival, and in 1686 he gave an absolute refusal to Obadiah Walker, afterwards the Roman Catholic master of University College, though licensed by James II, to print books, declaring he would as soon \\"part with his bed from under him\\" as his press. He conducted it on strict business principles, and to the criticism that more great works were not produced replied that they would not sell. He was, however, not free from fads, and his new spelling (of which one feature was the substitution of i for y in such words as cies, daies, maiest) met with great disapproval. Fell also wrote lives of his friends Henry Hammond (1661), Richard Allestree, prefixed to his edition of the latter's sermons (1684), and Thomas Willis, in Latin. His seasonable advice to Protestants showing the necessity of maintaining the Established Religion in opposition to Popery was published in 1688. Some of his sermons, which John Evelyn found dull, were printed, including Character of the Last Daies, preached before the king, 1675, and a sermon preached before the House of Peers on 22 December 1680. The Interest of England stated (1659), advocating the restoration of the king, and The Vanity of Scoffing (1674), are also attributed to him. Fell probably had some share in the composition of The Whole Duty of Man, and in the subsequent works published under the name of the author of The Whole Duty, which included Reasons of the Decay of Christian Piety, The Ladies' Calling, The Gentleman's Calling, The Government of the Tongue, The Art of Contentment, and The Lively Oracles given us, all of which were published in one volume with notes and a preface by Fell in 1684. =Linguist and translator= He had a high reputation as a Grecian, a Latinist and a philologist, and he brought out with the collaboration of others his edition of St Cyprian in 1682, an English translation of The Unity of the Church in 1681, editions of Nemesius of Emesa (1671), of Aratus and of Eratosthenes (1672), Theocritus (1676), Alcinous on Plato (1677), St Clement's Epistles to the Corinthians (1677), Athenagoras (1682), Clemens Alexandrinus (1683), Theophilus of Antioch (1684), Grammatica rationis sive institutiones logicae (1673 and 1685), and a critical edition of the New Testament in 1675. The first volumes of Rerum Anglicarum scriptores and of Historiae Britannicae, etc. were compiled under his patronage in 1684. Manuscripts of Saint Augustine were placed in the Bodleian at his behest; while other libraries at Oxford generously collated a catalogue for the use of the Benedictines at Paris, who were then preparing a new edition of the father. =Mission to India= Occasionally imprudent in his schemes, he was the originator of a mission to India which was taken up by the British East India Company. He undertook to train as missionaries four scholars at Oxford, procured a set of Arabic types, and issued from these the Gospels and Acts in the Malay language in 1677. This was unsuccessful, and the mission collapsed. =Controversy= Having undertaken at his own charge to publish a Latin version of Wood's History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford, with the object of presenting the history of the university in a manner worthy of the great subject to European readers, and of extending its fame abroad, he arrogated to himself the right of editing the work. \\"He would correct, alter, dash out what he pleased... He was a great man and carried all things at his pleasure.\\" In particular he struck out all the passages which Wood had inserted in praise of Thomas Hobbes, and substituted some disparaging epithets. He called Leviathan \\"monstrosissimus\\" and \\"publico damno notissimus.\\" To the printed remonstrance of Hobbes, Fell inserted an insulting reply in the History to \\"irritabile illud et vanissimum Malmesburiense animal,\\" and to the complaint of Wood at this usage answered only that Hobbes \\"was an old man, had one foot in the grave; that he should mind his latter end, and not trouble the world any more with his papers.\\" In small things as in great he loved to rule and direct. \\"Let not Fell,\\" writes R. South to Ralph Bathurst, \\"have the fingering and altering of them, for I think that, barring the want of siquidems and quinetiams, they are as good as his Worship can make.\\" Wood styled him \\"a valde vult person.\\" Not content with ruling his own college, he desired to govern the whole university. He prevented Gilbert Ironside, who \\"was not pliable to his humour,\\" from holding the office of Vice-Chancellor. He \\"endeavoured to carry all things by a high hand; scorn'd in the least to court the Masters when he had to have anything pass'd the convocation. Severe to other colleges, blind as to his own, very partiall and with good words, and flatterers and tell-tales could get anything out of him.\\" According to Bishop Gilbert Burnet, who praises his character and administration, Fell was\\" a little too much heated in the matter of our disputes with the dissenters...He had much zeal for reforming abuses, and managed it perhaps with too much heat and in too peremptory a way...But we have so little of that among us that no wonder if such men are censured by those who love not such patterns nor such severe task-masters.\\" And Anthony Wood, after declaring that Fell \\"was exceeding partial in his government even to corruption; went thro' thick and thin; grasped at all yet did nothing perfect or effectually; cared not what people said of him, was in many things very rude and in most pedantic and pedagogical,\\"‚Äî concluded that \\"yet still aimed at the public good.\\" Roger North, who paid Fell a visit at Oxford, wrote of him in terms of enthusiasm: \\"The great Dr Fell, who was truly great in all his circumstances, capacities, undertakings and learning, and above all for his superabundant public spirit and goodwill ... O the felicity of that age and place when his authority swayed!\\" In November 1684, at the command of King Charles II, Fell deprived John Locke, who had incurred the royal displeasure by his friendship with Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, and was suspected as the author of certain seditious pamphlets, of his studentship at Christ Church, summarily and without hearing his defence. Fell had in former years cultivated Locke's friendship, had kept up a correspondence with him, and in 1663 had written a testimonial in his favour; and the ready compliance of one who could on occasion offer a stout resistance to any invasion of the privileges of the university has been severely criticised. It must, however, be remembered in extenuation that the legal status of a person on the foundation of a collegiate body had not then been decided in the law-courts. He afterwards expressed his regret. Death Fell, who had never married, died worn out, according to Wood. He was buried in the divinity chapel in the cathedral, below the seat which he had so often occupied when living, where a monument and an epitaph, now moved elsewhere, were placed to his memory. \\"His death,\\" writes John Evelyn, \\"was an extraordinary losse to the poore church at this time\\". With all his faults Fell was a great man, \\"the greatest governor,\\" estimated Speaker Onslow, \\"that has ever been since his time in either of the universities,\\" and of his own college, to which he left several exhibitions for the maintenance of poor scholars, he was a second founder. A sum of money was left by John Cross to perpetuate Fell's memory by an annual speech in his praise, but the Felii laudes were discontinued in 1866. There are two interesting pictures of Fell at Christ Church, one where he is represented with his two friends Allestree and Dolben, and another by Anthony van Dyck. The statue placed on the northeast angle of the Great Quadrangle bears no likeness to the bishop, who is described by Hearne as a \\"thin grave man.\\" Trivia *In the film Hannibal, the character Hannibal Lecter poses as a library curator in Florence, Italy, under the alias \\"Dr Fell\\".

He was convicted of tampering with the gloves of Luis Resto for his fight against Billy Collins Jr. in 1983, which subsequently led to the end of Collins' boxing career. Collins suffered from depression and possibly committed suicide following the assault. Early career Lewis was a disciple of trainer Chickie Ferrara. He was Roberto Dur√°n's cornerman when Duran lost a unanimous decision against Wilfred Benitez in 1982.Pearlman, Jeff. Bare Knuckles. Sports Illustrated, October 26, 1998. During the early 1980s, he was considered one of the best trainers of his time, compared with Emanuel Steward and Lou Duva. The most noted boxer in his stable was light-welterweight champion Aaron Pryor. In 1982, Pryor fought Alexis Arg√ºello. Before the fourteenth round, a cornerman held up a plastic water bottle, but HBO cameras caught Lewis yelling, \\"Not that bottle, the one I mixed.\\" Pryor knocked out Arguello, but Lewis' comments fueled rumors that the bottle contained stimulants. Lewis said it only contained Perrier and tap water, in line with rules allowing boxers to consume only water in the ring. Although Lewis was never formally sanctioned, the incident sullied his reputation, which was confirmed by his cheating discovered in subsequent fights. It was later alleged in an interview with former Lewis-trained boxer Luis Resto in the HBO documentary film Assault in the Ring, that Lewis would break apart pills used to treat asthma and pour the medicine into the water, giving Resto greater lung capacity in the later rounds of a fight. Resto‚ÄìCollins controversy The most notorious incident in Lewis's career took place on June 16, 1983. A fighter he was training, Luis Resto, was fighting undefeated prospect Billy Collins, Jr. in a bout televised by ABC's Wide World of Sports. The fight was the undercard for a fight between Roberto Dur√°n and Davey Moore. Resto won in a 10-round unanimous decision over a bloody Collins. After the fight, Resto came to Collins' corner to shake hands with Collins' father and trainer, Billy Sr. When Billy Sr. grabbed Resto's hand, he discovered Resto's gloves were thinner than normal. Screaming that he thought the gloves had no padding, Collins Sr. demanded that the New York State Boxing Commission impound the gloves. An investigation found that each glove was missing an ounce of padding. There was also a 0.75-inch hole in the palm of each glove. Collins suffered a torn iris and permanently blurred vision, ending his boxing career. After an investigation, the New York State Boxing Commission determined Lewis had tampered with the gloves. On July 1, 1983, it permanently revoked Lewis' state boxing license. Since most state boxing commissions honor sanctions imposed by other states, this action had the effect of banning Lewis from ever having another official role in an American bout. Resto's win was subsequently changed to a no contest.Luis Resto In October 1986, Lewis and Resto were both put on trial and found guilty of assault, criminal possession of a weapon (Resto's hands) and conspiracy. Lewis was also found guilty of tampering with a sports contest. Prosecutors charged that since Lewis had deliberately removed the padding from Resto's gloves, the bout with Collins amounted to an illegal assault. Lewis was sentenced to six years in prison, Resto to three years. Lewis was released from prison in 1990.Farhood, Steve. Unforgiven . Boxing Monthly, 2000. Collins died on March 6, 1984, when he crashed his car into a culvert near his home in Antioch, Tennessee. Many think he may have committed suicide because he was unable to continue boxing as a result of the actions of Lewis and Resto. Years later, during the filming of the 2009 documentary Assault in the Ring, Resto admitted that he knew Lewis had not only tampered with the gloves, but Lewis had also wrapped Resto's hands with modern medical plaster. Lewis wet the plaster material and used it as a layer in Resto's hand wraps, illegally increasing his punching power. He also said that Lewis had taken the padding out of his gloves on at least two other occasions.Mladnich, Robert. Resto Comes Clean: He Knew Gloves Were Loaded . The Sweet Science, April 6, 2008. Resto also alleged that the plot centered around a large amount of money bet on himself, the underdog, by a third party who had met with Lewis prior to the fight. Lewis maintains his innocence to this day, and many of his defenders allege that someone instead removed the padding from Resto's gloves after the bout. For instance, an official with the New York State Boxing Commission left the gloves in his car after receiving them from the state boxing commission. However, this is belied by pictures of Collins' face after the bout; it was badly swollen, and many felt it was improbable a light puncher like Resto could have inflicted such damage on his own. When confronted by Resto and Assault in the Ring director and producer Eric Drath, Lewis again denied any wrongdoing and said that it was cornerman Artie Curley who had wrapped Resto's hands. An agitated Lewis said that if Curley were alive today, \\"none of this would have happened to him.\\" References External links * Assault in the Ring - Official Site 1945 births 2020 deaths American boxing trainers American people convicted of assault Sports controversies ","title":"Panama Lewis"},{"id":"242317","text":"Thomas Klestil (; 4 November 1932 ‚Äì 6 July 2004) was an Austrian diplomat and politician. He served as President of Austria in 1992 and was re-elected into office in 1998.  Biography until 1992  Born in Vienna to a working class family‚Äîhis father worked for the tramway‚ÄîKlestil went to school in Landstra√üe where he made friends with Joe Zawinul. He studied at the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration and received his doctorate in 1957. After entering the civil service he worked in Austria as well as abroad, for example for OECD. In 1969, he established the Austrian consulate-general in Los Angeles, where he befriended Arnold Schwarzenegger. Fluent in English, Klestil was the Austrian Ambassador to the United Nations (1978‚Äì1982) and Ambassador to the United States (1982‚Äì1987) prior to his election as president.  Presidency  After being nominated by the conservative Austrian People's Party to run for Federal President, he succeeded Kurt Waldheim on 8 July 1992. However, in the course of his two terms of office, Klestil's alienation from his own party became increasingly obvious, so much so that there was open antagonism between Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel and Klestil when, in 2000, the latter had to swear in the newly formed coalition government with J√∂rg Haider's Austrian Freedom Party. Klestil, who during his election campaign had vowed to be an \\"active\\" president, repeatedly criticized the Austrian government and, in an interview with a Swiss daily given in 2003, stated that, theoretically speaking, it was in his power to dismiss the government any time he found it necessary to do so. As a matter of fact the Austrian Constitution does give far-reaching powers to the Federal President, but these had never been exercised by any of Klestil's predecessors. = Support of Kiryat Mattersdorf = Klestil gave his support to the development of Kiryat Mattersdorf, a Haredi Jewish neighborhood in northern Jerusalem founded by the Mattersdorfer Rav, Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, in 1959 in memory of the Siebengemeinden (Seven Communities) of Burgenland that were destroyed in the Holocaust, Mattersdorf being one of them. Ehrenfeld's son, Rabbi Akiva Ehrenfeld, who served as president of the neighborhood, established close ties with the Austrian government to obtain funding for several institutions, including a kindergarten and the Neveh Simcha nursing home. Following Klestil's official state visit to Israel in 1994, which included a side tour of Kiryat Mattersdorf, Klestil hosted Ehrenfeld at an official reception at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna on 24 January 1995. (subscription required)  Personal  On 8 June 1967 she married Thomas Klestil had known Edith Wielander since they were both 17. The couple married in June 1967 and had three grown children together by the time of his election as president in 1992. The couple separated in 1994, when Klestil made public that he had a love affair with the much younger diplomat Margot L√∂ffler. The couple divorced in September 1998, and Klestil married L√∂ffler three months later. When Klestil died in 2004, Edith attended the funeral service.

On 10 July 2004, the funeral service was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, and he was interred in the presidential crypt at Vienna's Central Cemetery (Zentralfriedhof). Among the notable dignitaries who attended his funeral were Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Austrian President and UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, and the Austrian-born Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The leading judge Sir William Dolben was his brother. He was educated at Westminster School under Richard Busby and at Christ Church, Oxford.Alumni Oxonienses 1500‚Äì1714, Disbrowe-Dyve He fought on the Royalist side at the Battle of Marston Moor, in 1644, and in the defence of York, and was wounded twice.Venables p.189 By 1646, like most of the Royalists, he had abandoned all hope of victory and resumed his studies.Venables p.190 Subsequently, he took orders and maintained in private the proscribed Anglican service; during these years he lived at St Aldates, Oxford, home of his wife's father Ralph Sheldon, brother of the future Archbishop Sheldon.Venables p.190 =Bishop= At the Restoration, he became canon of Christ Church (1660) and prebendary of St Paul's, London (1661), no doubt partly due to the influence of Sheldon, now Bishop of London. As Dean of Westminster (1662‚Äì1683), he opposed an attempt to bring the abbey under diocesan rule. His charm, eloquence, generosity and frankness gained him enormous popularity. in 1664 he was appointed Clerk of the Closet (until 1668) and in 1666 was made Bishop of Rochester. The fall of his friend Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon the next year is said to have caused him to be in temporary disgrace, but he was quickly restored to favour. In 1675 he was appointed Lord High Almoner and in 1683 he was made Archbishop of York; he distinguished himself by reforming the discipline of the cathedrals in these dioceses. He was the first president of the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy when it received its Royal Charter in 1678. =Death and family= At Easter 1686, returning to York from London, he came into contact with a smallpox victim, caught the infection and died a few days later.Venables p.192 His last months are said to have been greatly troubled by King James II's attempts to re-establish the Roman Catholic faith.Venables p.192 He married Catherine Sheldon, a niece of Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury; her father was Ralph Sheldon of Stanton, Staffordshire. He had two sons, Gilbert, judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) and first of the Dolben baronets,Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 London John Murray Vol.2 p.17 and John Dolben, a well-known politician. From a letter Gilbert wrote in 1691 it seems that the Archbishop was much troubled in his last years by John's profligate behaviour: he was a confirmed gambler who went through all his money, and then lost the fortune he had gained by marriage to the heiress Elizabeth Mulso. His uncle the judge disinherited him, and by 1691 his wife and children were living on the charity of friends. According to Gilbert, his father's enemies happily seized on this family tragedy as evidence that the Archbishop was a bad or neglectful parent. All descriptions of him agree that he was a man of commanding appearance, tall, handsome and dark, but inclined to fat. The Archbishop Dolben cup presented at the York International 9s rugby league festival is named after John Dolben. In literature John Dryden, in Absalom and Achitophel, gave a portrait of Dolben: \\"Him of the Western dome, whose weighty sense Flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence\\".

Ebert was elected leader of the SPD on the death in 1913 of August Bebel. In 1914, shortly after he assumed leadership, the party became deeply divided over Ebert's support of war loans to finance the German war effort in World War I. A moderate social democrat, Ebert was in favour of the Burgfrieden, a political policy that sought to suppress squabbles over domestic issues among political parties during wartime in order to concentrate all forces in society on the successful conclusion of the war effort. He tried to isolate those in the party opposed to the war, but could not prevent a split. Ebert was a pivotal figure in the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19. When Germany became a republic at the end of World War I, he became its first chancellor. His policies at that time were primarily aimed at restoring peace and order in Germany and containing the more extreme elements of the revolutionary left. In order to accomplish these goals, he allied himself with conservative and nationalistic political forces, in particular the leadership of the military under General Wilhelm Groener and the right-wing Freikorps. With their help, Ebert's government crushed a number of socialist and communist uprisings as well as those from the right, including the Kapp Putsch. This has made him a controversial historical figure. Early life Friedrich Ebert (1890) Ebert was born in Heidelberg, Baden, German Empire on 4 February 1871 as the seventh of nine children of the tailor Karl Ebert (1834‚Äì92) and his wife Katharina (n√©e Hinkel; 1834‚Äì1897). Three of his siblings died at a young age. Although he wanted to attend university, this proved impossible due to the lack of funds of his family. Instead, he trained as a saddle-maker from 1885 to 1888. After he became a journeyman in 1889 he travelled, according to the German custom, from place to place in Germany, seeing the country and learning fresh details of his trade. In Mannheim, he was introduced by an uncle to the Social Democratic Party, joining it in 1889. Although Ebert studied the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, he was less interested in ideology than in practical and organisational issues that would improve the lot of the workers then and there. Ebert was on the \\"black list\\" of the police due to his political activities, so he kept changing his place of residence. Between 1889 and 1891 he lived in Kassel, Braunschweig, Elberfeld-Barmen, Remscheid, Quakenbr√ºck and Bremen, where he founded and chaired local chapters of the Sattlerverband (Association of Saddlers). After settling in Bremen in 1891, Ebert made a living doing odd jobs. In 1893, he obtained an editorial post on the socialist Bremer B√ºrgerzeitung. In May 1894, he married Louise Rump (1873‚Äì1955), daughter of a manual labourer, who had been employed as a housemaid and in labelling boxes and who was active in union work. He then became a pub owner that became a centre of socialist and union activity and was elected party chairman of the Bremen SPD. In 1900, Ebert was appointed a trade-union secretary (Arbeitersekret√§r) and elected a member of the Bremer B√ºrgerschaft (comitia of citizens) as representative of the Social Democratic Party. In 1904, Ebert presided over the national convention of the party in Bremen and became better known to a wider public. He became a leader of the \\"moderate\\" wing of the Social Democratic Party and in 1905 Secretary-General of the SPD, at which point he moved to Berlin. At the time, he was the youngest member of the Parteivorstand (party executive). Meanwhile, Ebert had run for a Reichstag (parliament of Germany) seat several times in constituencies where the SPD had no chance of winning: 1898 Vechta (Oldenburg), 1903 and 1906 Stade (Province of Hanover). However, in 1912, he was elected to the Reichstag for the constituency of Elberfeld-Barmen (today part of Wuppertal). This was the election that also made the SPD the strongest party in the Reichstag with 110 out of a total of 397 members, surpassing the Centre Party. On the death of August Bebel on 13 August 1913, Ebert was elected as joint party chairman at the convention in Jena on 20 September with 433 out of 473 votes. His co- chairman was Hugo Haase. Friedrich Ebert with his wife Louise and their children (from left to right) Friedrich, Georg and Heinrich (Christmas 1898) World War I When the July Crisis of 1914 erupted, Ebert was on vacation. After war was declared in early August, Ebert travelled to Z√ºrich with party treasurer Otto Braun and the SPD's money to be in a position to build up a foreign organisation if the SPD should be outlawed in the German Empire. He returned on 6 August and led the SPD Reichstag members to vote almost unanimously in favour of war loans, accepting that the war was a necessary patriotic, defensive measure, especially against the autocratic regime of the Tsar in Russia.Eberhard Pikart: Der deutsche Reichstag und der Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs, in: Der Staat 5, 1966, pp 58 ff In January 1916, Haase resigned. Under the leadership of Ebert and other \\"moderates\\" such as Philipp Scheidemann, the SPD party participated in the Burgfrieden, an agreement among the political parties in the Reichstag to suppress domestic policy differences for the duration of the war in order to concentrate the energies of the country solely on bringing the conflict to a successful conclusion for Germany. This positioned the party in favour of the war with the aim of a compromise peace, a stance that eventually led to a split in the SPD, with those radically opposed to the war leaving the SPD in early 1917 to form the USPD. Similar policy disputes caused Ebert to end his parliamentary alliance with several left-wing members of the Reichstag and start to work closely with the Centre Party and the Progress Party in 1916. Later those kicked out by Ebert called themselves \\"Spartacists\\". Beginning in 1916, Ebert shared the leadership of his Reichstag delegates with Scheidemann. Although he opposed a policy of territorial gains secured through military conquest on the western front (aside from Luxembourg which was German speaking and could be easily incorporated), Ebert supported the war effort overall as a defensive struggle. Ebert experienced the traumatic loss of having two of his four sons killed in the war: Heinrich died in February 1917 in Macedonia, whereas Georg was killed in action in May 1917 in France. In June 1917, a delegation of social democrats led by Ebert travelled to Stockholm for talks with socialists from other countries about a conference that would have sought to end the war without any annexations of territory on the western front except for Luxembourg and giving back most of Alsace and Loraine with blessings from the German government. The initiative failed, however. In January 1918, when the workers in munition factories in Berlin went on strike, Ebert joined the strike leadership, but worked hard to get the strikers back to work. He was pilloried by a few politicians from the extremist left as a \\"traitor to the working class\\", and from the right as a \\"traitor to the fatherland\\". Kaiser Wilhelm II and most politicians from both sides considered him an upstanding person and hero for getting them back to work non violently. Revolution of 1918‚Äì19 =Parliamentisation= As the war continued, the military Supreme Command (OHL), nominally headed by Paul von Hindenburg, but effectively controlled by his subordinate Erich Ludendorff, became the de facto ruler of Germany. When it became clear that the war was lost in late summer and fall of 1918, Ludendorff started to favour the \\"parliamentisation\\" of the German Empire, i.e. a transfer of power to those parties that held the majority in the Reichstag (SPD, Centre Party and Progress Party). The goal was to shift the blame for the military defeat from the OHL to the politicians of the majority parties. On 29 September 1918, Ludendorff suddenly informed Paul von Hintze, the German Foreign Minister, that the Western Front could collapse at any moment and that a ceasefire had to be negotiated without delay. However, he suggested that the request for the ceasefire should come from a new government sanctioned by the Reichstag majority. In his view, a \\"revolution from above\\" was needed. Chancellor Georg von Hertling and Kaiser Wilhelm II agreed, although the former resigned. Scheidemann and a majority of SPD deputies were opposed to joining \\"a bankrupt enterprise,\\" but Ebert convinced his party, arguing that \\"we must throw ourselves into the breach\\" and \\"it is our damned duty to do it\\". In early October, the Kaiser appointed a liberal, Prince Maximilian of Baden, as chancellor to lead peace negotiations with the Allies. The new government for the first time included ministers from the SPD: Phillip Scheidemann and Gustav Bauer. The request for a ceasefire went out on 4 October. On 5 October, the government informed the German public about these events. However, there was then a delay, as the American President Wilson initially refused to agree to the ceasefire. His diplomatic notes seemed to indicate that the changes to the German government were insufficient and the fact that Wilhelm II remained head of state was a particular obstacle. Ebert did not favour exchanging the monarchy for a republic, but like many others, he was worried about the danger of a socialist revolution, which seemed more likely with every day that passed. On 28 October, the constitution was changed to transfer power to the Reichstag. At this point, the majority parties of the Reichstag, including Ebert's SPD, were quite satisfied with the state of affairs; what they now needed was a period of calm to deal with the issue of negotiating an armistice and a peace treaty. =\\"November revolution\\"= The plans of the new German government were thrown into disarray when a confrontation between officers and crews on board the German fleet at Wilhelmshaven on 30 October set in motion a train of events that would result in a revolution that spread over a substantial part of the country over the next week. Against the backdrop of a country falling into anarchy, the SPD led by Ebert on 7 November demanded a more powerful voice in the cabinet, an extension of parliamentarism to the state of Prussia and the renunciation of the throne by both the Emperor and his oldest son, Crown Prince Wilhelm. Ebert had favoured retaining the monarchy under a different ruler, but at this time told Prince Maximilian von Baden, \\"If the Kaiser does not abdicate, the social revolution is inevitable. But I do not want it, I even hate it like sin.\\" On the left, the Spartacists (numbering around 100 in Berlin) and a group of around 80 to 100 popular labour leaders from Berlin known as Revolutionary Stewards (Revolution√§re Obleute) prepared for a revolution in the capital. On 9 November, the revolution reached Berlin as the larger companies were hit by a general strike called by the Spartacists and the Revolutionary Stewards, but also supported by the SPD and the mainstream unions. Workers' and soldiers' councils were created and important buildings occupied. As the striking masses marched on the centre of Berlin, the SPD, afraid of losing its influence on the revolution, announced that it was resigning from the government of Prince Maximilian. Meanwhile, Prince Maximilian had failed to convince Emperor Wilhelm II, who was at the army headquarters at Spa, Belgium, of the need to abdicate. Wilhelm had resigned himself to the loss of the imperial crown, but still thought he could remain king of Prussia. When Maximilian failed to convince him of the unreality of this belief, he unilaterally and untruthfully announced that Wilhelm had in fact abdicated and that the Crown Prince had agreed to relinquish his right of succession. Shortly thereafter, the SPD leadership arrived at the chancellery and Ebert asked Prince Maximilian to hand over the government to him. After a short meeting of the cabinet, the chancellor resigned and, in an unconstitutional move, handed his office over to Ebert, who thus became Chancellor of Germany and Minister President of Prussia: the first socialist, the second politician and the second commoner to hold either office. Ebert left the government of Prince Maximilian mostly unchanged, but appointed SPD operatives for the Prussian Minister of War and for the military commander of the Berlin area. Ebert's first action as chancellor was to issue a series of proclamations asking the people to remain calm, stay out of the streets and to restore peace and order. It failed to work. Ebert then had lunch with Scheidemann at the Reichstag and, when asked to do so, refused to speak to the masses gathered outside. Scheidemann however seized upon the opportunity, and in hopes of forestalling whatever the Communist leader Karl Liebknecht was telling his followers at the now-former royal palace, proclaimed Germany a republic. A furious Ebert promptly reproached him: \\"You have no right to proclaim the Republic!\\" By this he meant that the decision was to be left to an elected national assembly, even if that decision might be the restoration of the monarchy. Later that day, Ebert even asked Prince Maximilian to stay on as regent, but was refused. Since Wilhelm II had not actually abdicated on 9 November, Germany legally remained a monarchy until the Emperor signed his formal abdication on 28 November. But when Wilhelm handed over supreme command of the army to Paul von Hindenburg and left for the Netherlands on the morning of 10 November, the country was effectively without a head of state. People's Deputies Otto Landsberg, Philipp Scheidemann, Gustav Noske, Friedrich Ebert and Rudolf Wissell after the USPD had left the Council at the end of 1918 An entirely Socialist provisional government based on workers' councils was about to take power under Ebert's leadership. It was called the Council of the People's Deputies (Rat der Volksbeauftragten). Ebert found himself in a quandary. He had succeeded in bringing the SPD to power, and he was now in a position to put into law social reforms and improve the lot of the working class. Yet as a result of the revolution, he and his party were forced to share power with those on the left whom he despised: the Spartacists and the Independents. In the afternoon of 9 November, he grudgingly asked the USPD to nominate three ministers for the future government. Yet that evening a group of several hundred followers of the Revolutionary Stewards occupied the Reichstag building and were holding an impromptu debate. They called for the election of soldiers' and workers' councils the next day with an eye to name a provisional government: the Council of the People's Deputies. In order to keep control of events and against his own anti-revolutionary convictions, Ebert decided that he needed to co-opt the workers' councils and thus become the leader of the revolution while at the same time serving as the formal head of the German government. On 10 November, the SPD, led by Ebert, managed to ensure that a majority of the newly elected workers' and soldiers' councils came from among their own supporters. Meanwhile, the USPD agreed to work with him and share power in the Council of the People's Deputies, the new revolutionary government. Ebert announced the pact between the two socialist parties to the assembled councils who were eager for a unified socialist front and approved the parity of three members each coming from SPD and USPD. Ebert and Haase for the USPD were to be the joint chairmen. That same day, Ebert received a telephone call from OHL chief of staff Wilhelm Groener, who offered to cooperate with him. According to Groener, he promised Ebert the loyalty of the military in exchange for some demands: a fight against Bolshevism, an end to the system of soldiers' and workers' councils, a national assembly and a return to a state of law and order. This initiated a regular communication between the two that involved daily telephone conversations over a secret line, according to Groener. The agreements between the two became known as the Ebert‚ÄìGroener pact. =Council of the People's Deputies= In domestic policy, a number of social reforms were quickly introduced by the Council of the People's Deputies under Ebert's leadership, including unemployment benefits, the eight-hour workday, universal suffrage for everyone over the age of 20, the right of farmhands to organise, and increases in workers' old-age, sick and unemployment benefits.The Kings Depart: The Tragedy of Germany: Versailles and the German Revolution by Richard M. Watt A decree of 12 November 1918 established the Reich Office for Economic Demobilization, with the purpose of carrying the German economy over \\"to peace conditions.\\" On 22 November 1918, a regulation was issued by the Reich Food Office for election to \\"peasants' and workers' councils\\" which were subscribed to \\"by all agricultural associations.\\"Farm labor in Germany, 1810‚Äì1945; its historical development within the framework of agricultural and social policy by Frieda Wunderlich On 23 November 1918, the Reich Office for Economic Demobilization issued twelve regulations which set forth rules governing duration of the working day, sick leaves, paid vacations, \\"and other aspects of labour relations within the German economy.\\" A decree of the Office for Economic Demobilization made on 9 December 1918 provided that the state governments \\"should require the communes and communal unions to establish departments for general vocational guidance and for placement of apprentices.\\" On 23 November 1918, an Order was introduced prohibiting work in bakeries between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 am. In December 1918, the income limit for entitlement to health insurance coverage was raised from 2,500 to 5,000 marks. The right of free assembly and association, which was extended even to government workers and officials, was made universal, and all censorship was abolished. The Gesindeordnung (servant's ordinance promulgated in Prussia in 1810) was revoked, and all discriminatory laws against agricultural workers were removed. A Provisional Order on 24 January 1919 provided various rights for agricultural workers. In addition, provisions for labour protection (suspended during the war) were restored, and a number of decrees were issued establishing freedom of the press, religious freedom, and freedom of speech, and amnesty of political prisoners. Protections for homeworkers were also improved, and housing provision was increased.AQA History: The Development of Germany, 1871‚Äì1925 by Sally Waller A decree of 23 December 1918 regulated wage agreements, laying down that a wage agreement that had been concluded in any branch of employment between the competent trade union authority and the competent employers' authority had absolute validity, meaning that no employer could enter into any other agreement of his own initiative. In addition, an organisation of arbitral courts was set up to decide all disputes. A decree of 4 January 1919 compelled employers to reinstate their former labourers on demobilisation, while measures were devised to safeguard workers from arbitrary dismissal. Workers who felt that they had been treated unfairly could appeal to an arbitration court, and in case of necessity the demobilisation authorities \\"had the power to determine who should be dismissed and who should be retained in employment.\\" On 29 November 1918, the denial of voting rights to welfare recipients was repealed. A government proclamation of December 1918 ordered farmers to re-employ returning soldiers \\"at their former working place and to provide work for the unemployed,\\" while an important decree was issued that same month in support of Jugendpflege (youth welfare). In December 1918, the government granted provisionally the continuation of a maternity allowance introduced during the Great War, while a decree issued in January 1919 mandated the employment of disabled veterans. A Settlement Decree was issued by the government on 29 January 1919 \\"concerning the acquisition of land for the settlement of workers on the land\\" that foresaw \\"the possibility of expropriating estates over 100 hectares to facilitate settlement.\\" However, only just over 500,000 hectares were freed by 1928, benefiting 2.4% of the farming population. In addition, Ebert's government got food supplies moving again and issued various decrees related to the promotion of civil aviation and restrictions on firearm possession. =Civil war= In the weeks following the creation of the Council of the People's Deputies, Ebert and the leadership of the SPD sided with the conservative and nationalistic elements in German society (the civil servants, the armed forces, the police, the judiciary) against the forces of the revolution. The latter wanted to eliminate the challenge to the existing order posed by the workers' councils as soon as possible. Yet the majority of those in the workers' and soldiers' councils viewed themselves as supporters of the government. It was only the Spartacists who wanted a dictatorship of the workers. Ebert and Groener worked out a \\"program\\" to restore order in Berlin by having army units returning from the Western Front move in and disarm all paramilitary forces from 10 to 15 December. However, after the ten divisions had arrived, rather than remaining as a cohesive force, they dispersed. On 16 December, the Reichsr√§tekongress (congress of councils) met in Berlin and set the date for elections to the National Assembly for 19 January 1919. However, it also passed a resolution that was aimed at ensuring that the military would be under the strict control of the civilian government, i.e. the Council of the People's Deputies. It also called for a powerful position of the soldiers' councils vis-√†-vis the professional officer corps. This was unacceptable to the leaders of the military and the OHL began to establish volunteer regiments in the Berlin area. Fighting erupted on 24 December on the Schlossplatz in Berlin (the Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss). On 23 December, dissatisfied members of the Navy occupied the chancellery and put the Peoples' Deputies under house arrest. Ebert asked the OHL for help over the phone and troops assembled on the outskirts of the capital. During the night, Ebert then ordered these troops to attack, which they did in the morning of 24 December. When the fighting stopped in the afternoon, the Navy forces held the field, but they returned to their barracks, ending the crisis. As a result of this event, which Karl Liebknecht called \\"Ebert's Bloody Christmas,\\" the USPD members left the Council of the Peoples' Deputies on 29 December. The next day, SPD members Gustav Noske and Rudolf Wissell took their place and from that point on, government communiques were signed Reichsregierung (i.e. federal government) instead of \\"Council of the Peoples' Deputies.\\" That same day, the Spartacists severed their remaining links with the USPD and set themselves up as the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). The week of 5‚Äì12 January 1919 became known as \\"Spartacus week,\\" but historians view this as a misnomer. The \\"Spartacist uprising\\" was more an attempt by the Berlin workers to regain what they thought had been won in the November revolution and what they now seemed to be in the process of losing. The trigger was a trivial event: the head of the Berlin police, a member of the USPD, refused to accept his dismissal. The USPD called for a demonstration of solidarity, but was itself surprised by the reaction as hundreds of thousands, many of them armed, gathered in the city centre on 5 January. They seized the newspapers and railway stations. Representatives from the USPD and KPD decided to topple the Ebert government. However, the next day, the gathered masses did not seize government buildings, as the expected support from the military did not materialize. Ebert started to negotiate with the leaders of the uprising, but simultaneously prepared for military action. Noske was made commander of the Freikorps (a right-wing paramilitary organization) and Ebert worked to mobilise the regular armed forces of the Berlin area on the government's side. From 9 to 12 January on Ebert's orders, regular forces and Freikorps successfully and bloodily suppressed the uprising. President of Germany Ebert, right, with Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno (1923) In the first German presidential election, held on 11 February 1919, five days after the Nationalversammlung (constituent assembly) convened in Weimar, Ebert was elected as provisional president of the German Republic. He remained in that position after the new constitution came into force and was sworn in as Reichspr√§sident on 21 August 1919. He was Germany's first-ever democratically elected head of state, and was also the first commoner, the first socialist, the first civilian, and the first person from a proletarian background to hold that position. In the whole time of the unified German Reich's existence from 1871 to 1945, he was also the only head of state who was unequivocally committed to democracy. One of Ebert's first tasks as president was to deal with the Treaty of Versailles. When the treaty's terms became public on 7 May 1919, it was cursed by Germans of all political shades as an onerous \\"Diktat\\", particularly because Germany had essentially been handed the treaty and told to sign without any negotiations. Ebert himself denounced the treaty as \\"unrealizable and unbearable.\\"William Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (Touchstone Edition) (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990) However, Ebert was well aware of the possibility that Germany would not be in a position to reject the treaty. He believed that the Allies would invade Germany from the west if Germany refused to sign. To appease public opinion, he asked Hindenburg if the army was capable of holding out if the Allies renewed hostilities. He promised to urge rejection of the treaty if there was even the remote possibility that the army could make a stand. Hindenburg, with some prodding from Groener, concluded that the army was not capable of resuming the war even on a limited scale. Rather than tell Ebert himself, he dispatched Groener to deliver the Army's conclusion to the president. Ebert thus advised the National Assembly to approve the treaty, which it did by a large majority on 9 July. Reichstag, 15 May 1919 The government's fight against Communist forces, as well as recalcitrant socialists, went on after Ebert became president. From January to May 1919, in some areas through the summer, civil war in Germany continued. Since 19 January elections had returned a solid majority for the democratic parties (SPD, Zentrum, and DDP), Ebert felt that the revolutionary forces had no legitimacy left. He and Noske now used the same forces they had earlier employed in Berlin on a national scale to dissolve the workers' councils and to restore law and order. In March 1920, during the right-wing Kapp Putsch by some Freikorps elements, the government, including Ebert, had to flee from Berlin. However, a refusal by civil servants to accept the self-declared government and a general strike called by the legitimate cabinet led to the collapse of the putsch. After it ended, striking workers in the Ruhr region refused to return to work. Led by members of the USPD and the KPD, they presented an armed challenge to the authority of the government. The government then sent Reichswehr and Freikorps troops to quell the Ruhr Uprising by force. To avoid an election campaign at a critical time, the Reichstag extended his term of office on 24 October 1922 until 25 June 1925, with a qualified majority vote that changed the constitution. As president, Ebert appointed centre-right figures like Wilhelm Cuno and Hans Luther as Chancellor and made rigorous use of his wide-ranging powers under Article 48 of the Weimar constitution. For instance, he used Article 48 powers to deal with the Kapp Putsch and the Beer Hall Putsch. Through 1924, he used the presidency's emergency powers a total of 134 times. After the civil war, he changed his politics to a \\"policy of balance\\" between the left and the right, between the workers and the owners of business enterprises. In that endeavor, he followed a policy of brittle coalitions. This resulted in some problems, such as the acceptance, during the crisis of 1923, by the SPD of longer working hours without extra compensation while the conservative parties ultimately rejected the other element of the compromise, the introduction of special taxes for the rich. Death Ebert's funeral Ebert's tomb in Heidelberg Memorial medal of the first President of Germany by August Hummel 1925, obverse The reverse showing the dates of his birth and of his death. Ebert suffered from gallstones and frequent bouts of cholecystitis. Vicious attacks by Ebert's right-wing adversaries, including slander and ridicule, were often condoned or even supported by the judiciary when the president turned to the courts. The constant necessity to defend himself against those attacks also undermined his health. In December 1924, a court in Magdeburg fined a journalist who had called Ebert a \\"traitor to his country\\" for his role in the January 1918 strike, but it also said that, legally, Ebert had in fact committed treason. This court case prevented him from seeking medical help for a while, as he wanted to be available to give evidence. He became acutely ill in mid-February 1925 from what was believed to be influenza. His condition deteriorated over the following two weeks, and at that time he was thought to be suffering from another episode of gallbladder disease. He became acutely septic on the night of 23 February and underwent an emergency appendectomy (which was performed by August Bier) in the early hours of the following day for what turned out to be appendicitis. He died of septic shock four days later, aged 54. He was buried in Heidelberg. Several high-ranking politicians and a trade union president made speeches at his funeral, as did protestant minister Hermann Maas, pastor at the Church of the Holy Spirit in Heidelberg; by doing so, Maas caused a scandal in his church and conservative quarters, because Ebert had been an outspoken atheist (though baptised a Roman Catholic, he had officially left the church long ago).See Walter M√ºhlhausen, Friedrich Ebert 1871‚Äì1925 ‚Äì Reichspr√§sident der Weimarer Republik, pp. 977ff; Werner Keller: \\"Hermann Maas ‚Äì Heiliggeistpfarerr und Br√ºckenbauer\\" in: Gottfried Seeba√ü, Volker Sellin, Hans Gercke, Werner Keller, Richard Fischer (editors): Die Heiliggeistkirche zu Heidelberg 1398‚Äì1998, Umschau Buchverlag, 2001, , pp. 108ff.  Friedrich Ebert Foundation  Ebert's policy of balancing the political factions during the Weimar Republic is seen as an important archetype in the SPD. Today, the SPD-associated Friedrich Ebert Foundation, Germany's largest and oldest party-affiliated foundation, which, among other things, promotes students of outstanding intellectual ability and personality, is named after Ebert.  Controversy about the Freikorps collaboration  Ebert remains a controversial figure to this day. While the SPD recognizes him as one of the founders and keepers of German democracy whose death in office was a great loss, others argue that he paved the way for national socialism by supporting the Freikorps and their suppression of worker uprisings. Ebert effectively allied himself with forces that in truth considered the republic tainted beyond redemption for being associated with the national humiliation of November 1918 and the Treaty of Versailles. They also failed to thank him for working with them in suppressing the more radical leftist groups. As a social democrat Ebert was considered to be the political enemy by conservative and nationalistic groups. They subsequently claimed that the German working class, supported by the SPD, was responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I. The alleged proof of this Dolchsto√ülegende was found in a number of strikes during 1917 and 1918 which had partly disrupted production in the Imperial German armaments industry. The aim of the striking workers and their socialist allies was said to have been to turn the German Empire into a Soviet Socialist Republic. In addition, it had been the majority parties of the Reichstag which formally asked for the ceasefire in October 1918 and it had been the civilian government rather than the military which represented Germany in the ceasefire negotiations of November 1918. Most historians, however, agree that military defeat was inevitable after the U.S. had joined the war against Germany. Some historians have defended Ebert's actions as unfortunate but inevitable if the creation of a socialist state on the model that had been promoted by Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and the communist Spartacists was to be prevented. Leftist historians like as well as mainstream ones like Sebastian Haffner on the other hand, have argued that organized communism was not yet politically relevant in Germany at the time.Bernt Engelmann: Einig gegen Recht und Freiheit. Deutsches Anti-Geschichtsbuch. 2. Teil, Bertelsmann, M√ºnchen 1975 However, the actions of Ebert and his Minister of Defense, Gustav Noske, against the insurgents contributed to the radicalization of the workers and to increasing support for communistic ideas. Although the Weimar constitution (which Ebert signed into law in August 1919Weimar Germany by Anthony McElligott) provided for the establishment of workers' councils on different levels of society, they did not play a major part in the political life of the Weimar Republic. Ebert always regarded the institutions of parliamentary democracy as a more legitimate expression of the will of the people; workers' councils, as a product of the revolution, were only justified in exercising power for a transitive period. \\"All power to all the people!\\" was the slogan of his party, in contrast to the slogan of the far left, \\"All power to the (workers') councils!\\". In Ebert's opinion only reforms, not a revolution, could advance the causes of democracy and socialism. He therefore has been called a traitor by leftists, who claim he paved the way for the ascendancy of the far right and even of Adolf Hitler, whereas those who think his policies were justified claim that he saved Germany from Bolshevik excesses.

Early life He was born at Chertsey in Surrey on 18 August 1605, the youngest son of John Hammond (c. 1555‚Äì1617), physician to the royal household under King James I, who purchased the site of Chertsey Abbey in Surrey in 1602. His brother was Judge Thomas Hammond, a regicide of King Charles I. He was educated at Eton College, and from age 13 at Magdalen College, Oxford, becoming demy or scholar in 1619. On 11 December 1622 he graduated B.A. (M.A. 30 June 1625, B.D. 28 January 1634, and D.D. in March 1639), and in 1625 was elected a fellow of the college. He took Holy Orders in 1629, and in 1633 in preaching before the court, standing in for Accepted Frewen, he won the approval of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and was presented with the living of Penshurst in Kent.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=62856#n31 His mother kept house for him, and aided him in parochial work. He undertook the education of William Temple, and supported the education of the antiquary William Fulman. Royalist cleric In 1640 he became a member of convocation, and was present at the passing of Laud's new canons. Soon after the meeting of the Long parliament, the committee for depriving scandalous ministers summoned Hammond, but he declined to leave Penshurst. He was nominated one of the Westminster Assembly, by Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton. In 1643 he was made Archdeacon of Chichester, recommended by Brian Duppa. Instead of sitting in the Assembly, he took part in the unsuccessful rising at Tonbridge in favour of King Charles I: Hammond helped to raise a troop of horse in his neighbourhood for the King's service, and was obliged to flee in disguise for Oxford, then the royal headquarters. He left Penshurst by night in July for the house of a friend, Thomas Buckner, who had been his tutor at Magdalen.Dr. Buckner in the DNB as in Fell's original life. Thomas Buckner, who died in 1645, was rector of Merstham, Surrey from 1632, and of Chevening, Kent from 1633; and was a Magdalen man; CCED page . Chevening and Penshurst are quite close, in the Sevenoaks district. From John Rouse Bloxam, A Register of the Members of St. Mary Magdalen College, Oxford, vol. 3 (1894), p. 151 and the absence of other Buckners in the Register, the identification seems clear; Buckner influenced the young Peter Heylyn. The Doctor title is not a D.D., but is seen in Bloxam. Buckner became notorious as having licensed William Prynne's Histrio-mastix, and was before the Star Chamber in February 1634 with Prynne. Cyndia Susan Clegg, Press Censorship in Caroline England (2008), p. 170. Here he was joined by an old friend, John Oliver. When they had to move on, the two set off for Winchester, then held by the Royalists. On their journey a messenger announced to Oliver that he had been chosen President of Magdalen, and Hammond accompanied him to Oxford. Hammond procured rooms in his own college, and devoted himself to study and writing. In 1644 he published anonymously his popular Practical Catechism. One of Charles I's last acts at Carisbrooke Castle was to entrust to Sir Thomas Herbert a copy of the book, to give to his son Henry, Duke of Gloucester. Hammond was chaplain to the royal commissioners at the Treaty of Uxbridge (30 January 1645), where he disputed with Richard Vines, one of the parliamentary envoys. He returned to Oxford, and about 17 March 1645 Charles I bestowed upon him a canonry at Christ Church; the university chose him to be public orator at the same time, and he was made one of the royal chaplains. On 26 April 1646 the King fled from Oxford, and Oxford surrendered (24 June 1646). Charles I, on 31 January 1647, the day after his arrival at Holmby House, requested Parliament to allow Hammond and another chaplain to attend him. This was refused on the ground that neither of them had taken the Solemn League and Covenant. When Charles I was removed by the army to Childersley (5 June 1647), Thomas Fairfax and his officers agreed that Charles I's request for his chaplains should be complied with. About a fortnight later Hammond and Gilbert Sheldon, another royal chaplain, in company with James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, joined the king. Parliament sent an order for their removal, but the army, now independent in its power, paid no attention. The chaplains were summoned to the bar of the house, but disregarded the summons. Fairfax wrote deprecating the notion that they would prejudice the peace of the state. At Woburn, Caversham, and Hampton Court, Hammond was constantly with the king. At Hampton Court Hammond introduced to him his nephew, Colonel Robert Hammond, soon to be governor of the Isle of Wight. Charles I, thinking he might trust his chaplain's nephew, escaped towards the Isle of Wight (12 November 1647), and was placed by the governor in Carisbrooke Castle, where Sheldon and Hammond again joined him. At Christmas 1647 they were removed from their attendance. Hammond returned to Oxford, where parliamentary visitors had been at work. Samuel Fell, dean of Christ Church, was in prison. Hammond, appointed sub-dean of Christ Church, took on the management of the college. He was soon summoned before the visitors at Merton College, and refused to submit to their authority, and was deprived and imprisoned, together with Sheldon, by an order of Parliament. Edward Corbet, a member of the Westminster Assembly, who succeeded to Hammond's canonry at Christ Church in January 1648, resigned it in August, after persuading himself (it is said) that Hammond had acted on principle. Colonel Evelyn, the puritan governor of Wallingford Castle, to whom Parliament sent an order for the custody of Sheldon and Hammond, declined to act as their gaoler, and said that he would only receive them as friends. At Westwood Hammond settled for the remainder of his life. In August 1651 he attended Pakington to the royal camp at Worcester, and had an interview with King Charles II. Pakington was taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester, 3 September but soon returned home uninjured. In 1655 an ordinance was issued forbidding the ejected clergy to act as schoolmasters or private chaplains, or perform any clerical functions, thus depriving them of all means of subsistence. Hammond and others were much involved in supporting clergy in this position. In the last six years of his life his health began to fail. Death and reputation Hammond died of an attack of stone on 25 April 1660, the day that Parliament voted that the king should be brought back; had he lived he would have been made bishop of Worcester. He was buried in the family vault of the Pakingtons, in the chancel of Hampton Lovett Church. There is a Latin inscription on his monument by Humphrey Henchman, bishop of Salisbury, and afterwards of London. Hammond left his books to his friend Richard Allestree. Hammond was held in high esteem even by his opponents. He was an excellent preacher; Charles I pronounced him the most natural orator he had ever heard. Works His writings, published in four folio volumes (1674‚Äì1684), consist mostly of controversial sermons and tracts; he produced more than 50 separate works. The Anglo-Catholic Library contains four volumes of his Miscellaneous Theological Works (1847‚Äì1850). The best of them are his Practical Catechism, first published in 1644; his Paraphrase and Annotations on the New Testament (1653); and an incomplete work of a similar nature on the Old Testament. His Life by John Fell, prefixed to the collected Works, was reprinted in vol. iv. of Wordsworth's Ecclesiastical Biography. Hammond was a pioneer Anglican theologian, much influenced by Richard Hooker and Lancelot Andrewes, but also by Arminianism in the form it took in Hugo Grotius, whom he defended in his writings. He was the first English scholar to compare manuscripts of the New Testament. He relied heavily on his readings in patristics, and with James Ussher and Isaak Voss argued in favour of the authenticity of the Ignatian Epistles, which could be read as supporting episcopacy. He was attacked by Salmasius and David Blondel, and defended himself.Dissertationes Quatuor, quibus Episcopatus Jura ex S. Scripturis et primaeva Antiquitate adstruuntur, contra sententiam D. Blondelli, &c.; London, 1651.Arthur Middleton, Fathers and Anglicans (2001), pp. 158-167. His defence and celebration of episcopacy as traditional was then followed by many English high church theologians: Miles Barne, Henry Dodwell, Fell, Peter Heylyn, Benjamin Lany, Thomas Long, Simon Lowth, John Pearson, Herbert Thorndike, and Francis Turner.John Marshall, John Locke (1994), p. 35. He read widely, and was a diligent scholar. He translated Blaise Pascal's Provincial Letters in 1657, under the title of Les Provinciales, or the Mystery of Jesuitisme, discovered in certain letters written upon occasion of the present differences at Sorbonne between the jansenists and the molinists, London, Royston, 1657).See Louis Cognet's introduction (in French) to the Lettres Provinciales, of 1965; re-published in Sellier's edition of Pascal, Les Provinciales, Pens√©es et Opuscules divers, Classique Garnier 1991-1992 or Librairie G√©n√©rale Fran√ßaise, Paris, 2004 (Pochot√®que, p. 218). Cognet says that Henry Hammond had worked on exemplaries of the original edition, and had the text established by a professional translator, John Davies (Cognet quotes here Paule Jansen, De Blaise Pascal √† Henry Hammond: \\"Les Provinciales\\" en Angleterre\\", Paris, 1954). This translation was re-published in 1658 and completed in 1659).  Footnotes  References * Attribution: External links *The Life of The most Learned, Reverend and Pious Dr H.

Glory is a god from a hell dimension and was the main antagonist of the fifth season. Character biography =History= Glorificus (also known as \\"Glory\\") is a god from a hell dimension in which she ruled alongside two other deities. Her power and dominion were vast and continued to grow stronger and stronger, as did her lust for misery and destruction, and she quickly became the most powerful of the three hell gods. Fearful that Glorificus would seize total control of the dimension for herself, the two Gods allied together and went to war against her. The hell gods barely defeated her, but despite their victory, she was too powerful to destroy, so they banished her into the earthly dimension, where her essence would be imprisoned in a human child named Ben, created solely to \\"contain\\" her until he eventually died as a mortal, sealing her. Glory was too powerful to be completely contained within the human vessel and when Ben reached his 20s, Glory began to gain control over Ben for short periods of time, taking the form of a vain, self-centered human female possessing superhuman strength, speed and invulnerability. Glory's strength was greater than that of any Slayer, vampire or demon on Earth, although her powers were greatly diminished compared with those she had in her true form. Dark magicks prevent humans from learning that Glory and Ben are one and the same; even when she transforms right in front of someone, they instantly forget what they saw. The spell does not affect supernatural creatures like vampires and demons. This becomes a recurring joke in the penultimate episode of Season Five, where Spike finds himself repeatedly having to explain that Ben and Glory are the same person, only for people to either to misunderstand him or to instantly forget. As Ben and Glory's personalities begin to merge more and more (see below), the magic weakens until, in the finale, the whole gang is able to see through it. This human form is Glory's only weakness; if the human vessel containing her is killed, then Glory perishes with him. Glory's goal is to find the Key, a \\"mystical energy nexus\\" which is the only way for her to return to her original dimension. Unfortunately, using the Key will break down the barriers between all dimensions, causing all worlds to bleed into each other and allowing \\"Hell to reign on Earth\\". The Key was safe, guarded by an ancient group of monks known as The Order of Dagon. When they discovered \\"The Beast\\" (Glory) was searching for the Key they chose to hide it. Using ancient magic they transformed the Key into a human girl and placed her under the protection of the Slayer Buffy, altering the memories of the Slayer and anyone connected to her into believing the girl was Buffy's younger sister Dawn. The Order of Dagon were eventually destroyed by Glory. The last monk of the order was taken prisoner and interrogated by Glory, and later rescued by Buffy. Before the monk died from his wounds he revealed to Glory (under torture) that the Key had been transformed, but not what the Key had become. The monk, after being rescued by Buffy, revealed to Buffy that Dawn was the Key, something she already suspected. Glory was also opposed by a military order known as the \\"Knights of Byzantium\\", composed of knights and clerics. They swore to prevent Glory from using the Key, and they attempted to kill Dawn before Glory could find her. In the episode \\"Spiral\\", a large group of knights besiege Buffy and Dawn, but Glory arrives and slaughters nearly all of them, taking the Key with her. =The Key= The Key is an ancient power, an ancient green mystical energy that according to Glory \\"is almost as old as she is\\". The Key needs to draw on powers from the dimension it's in before being used, which is why it can only be used at a certain time and certain place. Who or what created the Key or how is unknown, even its true purpose is never fully revealed. The Key seems to work by destroying the barriers that separate one dimension from another. The longer the Key is in use, the more the walls of reality begin to break down. When the Key is activated, a small portal opens and begins to grow, in which demons, creatures and entire dimensions begin immediately bleeding through. Buffy's first confrontation with Glory came shortly after discovering there was something not right about Dawn. Buffy tried to go up against Glory and failed miserably. Glory beat Buffy severely, destroying an entire building in the process. The only thing Buffy did manage to do was escape during a temper tantrum by Glory which caused the building to collapse, escaping with the last surviving monk who quickly revealed to her the truth about Dawn being the Key and Buffy as her protector. =Sunnydale= Although Glory enters early on in Season 5, the Scooby Gang knows very little about her, only discovering her name from one of Glory's minions. Glory's god-like status, her extreme power level, her origins, the Key's true nature and history are not known until later episodes. Glory comes to Sunnydale looking for \\"The Key\\", which will allow her to return to her own dimension. The Key would cause damage to all dimensions, including the dimension Buffy and her friends inhabit, though Glory seems to be unaware or unconcerned of this fact. Glory is not aware of what form the Key has taken, though she knows that Buffy, the Slayer, protects it. For her part, Buffy is not initially aware of the Key's nature either. It is eventually revealed that Buffy's \\"new sister\\", Dawn, is the Key, in human form. She begins the quest to locate the Key, aided by a race of pale, black-eyed demons who are loyal to her almost to a fault, though she does not care for them and viciously abuses them, both verbally and physically, for even the slightest failures. Glory quickly establishes herself as one of Buffy's most dangerous and determined enemies. At one point, she confronts Buffy in her own home, openly threatening to kill Buffy's friends and family and force Buffy herself to watch her do so. Due to Glory being a god in a human body, the human mind can not control such power and this gradually turns Glory insane. In order to maintain her sanity and power, Glory feeds off the mental energies of humans by a process that Buffy and her friends refer to as \\"brain-sucking\\". She inserts her fingers into the victim's head, absorbing the energies that bind the victim's mind. The humans that she \\"devours\\" in this way become incoherent and mentally unstable; those affected are also able to see Dawn in her true form. Glory's arrival in Sunnydale is followed by an inexplicable increase in the number of mental patients. One of her unfortunate victims is Willow's girlfriend, Tara, who later inadvertently betrays Dawn to Glory. The Scoobies try to run, but Glory still manages to kidnap Dawn shortly afterward. The Key can only be used at a certain time, and as that time draws near, the power that separates Glory from Ben dissolves. They still inhabit Ben's body separately, but their memories and personalities begin to blur together. After recovering from a mental breakdown caused by Glory's kidnapping of Dawn, Buffy decides to attack Glory with everything she has: Willow's magic spell to restore Tara's sanity stolen by Glory, at the same time weakening Glory's mind; the Dagon Sphere (a weapon created by the monks that causes physical pain to Glory); Buffy's robot double (the \\"Buffybot\\") originally Spike's sex toy; Olaf, The Troll God's Hammer (with which Buffy is able beat Glory in battle and severely weaken her albeit temporarily, due to the hammer being a weapon of the gods); and eventually a wrecking ball, commandeered by Xander. Glory is left defeated and significantly weakened, losing her hold on this reality and returning to the form and mind of Ben. Buffy then tells Ben to tell Glory to leave Sunnydale and never return. As Buffy walks off, Giles knows that Glory will eventually regain her power and return to get her revenge on Buffy unless Ben is killed, so he smothers Ben to death with his bare hands, ensuring that Glory can never return. Meanwhile, Spike, Giles, and Anya attack her minions. The final spell that opens the rift between dimensions had already been started by one of Glory's disciples - Doc - by cutting Dawn with a knife and making her bleed (the act of which opens a portal to the other dimensions). After killing Doc, Buffy realizes that because the monks created Dawn from her essence, they share the same blood which means not only Dawn's blood but her own can close the portal, but it would also require her to die (her blood must stop flowing for the gateway to close). After saying goodbye to her sister, Buffy jumps into the portal that is opening, instantly dying and closing the gateway. Glory is also referred to as \\"Glorificus\\" by her minions and in most textual references, and occasionally as \\"The Beast\\" by the monks who created Dawn (although she has nothing to do with The Beast who appeared in Angel, the spin-off series of Buffy the Vampire Slayer). After Glory's defeat, her final appearance in the series is at the end of the episode \\"Lessons\\", as an avatar of the First Evil along with most of the other major villains from the series. Name \\"That Which Cannot Be Named\\" came into existence before written word, and therefore (as its title implies) has no name. When the hell-god came to this dimension, she was dubbed \\"Glorificus\\" or sometimes \\"Glorifius,\\" names which she shortened to \\"Glory.\\" She was also known as \\"the Glorious One\\" (among many other amusing, groveling titles such as \\"Her Splendiferousness,\\" \\"Her Sparkling Luminescence\\" and \\"Oh Sweaty-Naughty-Feelings-Causing One\\") by her demon minions, and as \\"the Beast\\" or \\"the Abomination\\" by the human priesthood and the Knights of Byzantium. The Scooby Gang and Ben often refer to her by the insulting name of \\"Hell-Bitch.\\" According to Jane Espenson, Glory was originally named Cherry. Powers and abilities In Season 5, Episode 13, \\"Blood Ties,\\" the gang begins discussing the Watcher Council's research on Glory. Buffy asks whether or not Glory, as a god, can summon elements like lightning. Giles responds, \\"Normally, yes, but since she is in human form, her powers are severely limited.\\" During season five the following were demonstrated: * Near-invulnerability: Only a Troll God's hammer was able to do any lasting damage to Glory when used repeatedly. In \\"Tough Love,\\" Willow's lightning bolts caused her pain, but caused no visible damage, though she comments that Willow's assault \\"slowed her down\\". By the time of the season finale, Buffy mentions that Willow was the only one ever successful in actually hurting Glory up to that point. When a building collapses on top of her (see below), she was slowed down, but was unharmed. Similarly, she was unharmed after being hit by a truck. * Superhuman strength: Glory possesses enormous physical strength far beyond that of most, if not all, vampires, demons, or Slayers; in fact, she is considered to be the most physically powerful Big Bad in the series, shown to be able to inflict massive damage on her opponents through pure brute force and physical strength alone. At one point, a building collapses on her after she repeatedly stomps her foot in a temper tantrum over a broken shoe. In \\"Intervention\\", she kicked Spike clear across her living room, through a solid wooden door, and to the other end of the room behind said door after losing her patience with him. In \\"Tough Love\\", she squeezed Tara's hand to the point where it oozed blood, right before she fed off of her brain. In \\"Spiral\\", she punches a hole through the barrier that Willow had previously generated. Even Buffy, with her slayer strength, could barely stand toe-to-toe in a fight of brawl. * Superspeed: Glory's super-speed is depicted as a fast-moving blur that is apparently invisible to the naked eye. This is seen when she pursues Buffy and Dawn immediately after Tara, in her insane state, accidentally reveals that Dawn is the Key. * Brain sucking: The ability to drain the mental energy of humans. This was primarily to maintain her own mental strength, but would also prevent Ben's form from resuming control. Not only does the drain draw out all energy leaving the victims in an insane state, they are also able to visually see the Key's true energy and ultimately become psychically linked to Glory and the Key. * Shroud of illusion: A mystical shroud cast to prevent people from learning that she and Ben were the same person, the origins of which are unclear. It only works on humans; vampires, demons, and other non-humans are immune. She loses this capability in the penultimate episode of Season Five. * Creature identification: The ability to differentiate between vampires and humans and also from any other creature from the Key, as seen in \\"Intervention\\", when her minions capture Spike under the mistaken impression that he is the Key. And also when they assume Tara is the Key and Glory quickly identifies she is not. * Omnilingualism: Able to speak and understand any human or demon language. This is known when humans and demons would talk to her in other languages and she would easily be able to interpret and understand. * Magic: In \\"Shadow\\", Glory cast an ancient spell that caused an ordinary snake to grow to a massive size and granted it the ability to see the true form of the Key, in addition to making it completely loyal to her. According to Giles, a spell such as that would need enormous levels of magic to perform, and Glory cast it easily. The extent of Glory's true powers as a hell-god were never revealed or used, though according to Gregor in \\"Spiral\\", they were beyond what even her compatriot hell-gods could conceive. She later secures Ben's aid in recapturing Dawn by promising him immortality. Personality Clare Kramer says Glory's strength was her lack of self-doubt: \\"She was completely secure in herself, focused on what she wanted and dedicated to her cause.\\" Her strength was also her downfall; Kramer notes that Glory was unable \\"to look at more than just herself.\\" According to Doug Petrie, \\"Joss very much wanted someone who was like the Joker to Batman. Someone who was just dynamic, charismatic and psychotic and we have all that. And Glory looks a lot better in a hot little red dress than the Joker ever did! We've got it all in Glory.\\" Servants * Dreg * Jinx * Murk * Slook * Gronx * The High Priest Minion * Doc Art links The picture in the living room of Glory's mansion is a copy of Tamara de Lempicka's Group of Four Nudes. The Polish art d√©co/futurist artist is renowned for being strongly feminist and openly bisexual/lesbian. In Buffy & Angel: Official Yearbook 2006, Glory was voted number one by fans as \\"Best Buffyverse Villain\\", followed by Angelus and the Mayor respectively. Appearances =Canonical appearances= Glory appeared in 13 canonical episodes: * Season 5: \\"No Place Like Home\\" (first appearance); \\"Family\\"; \\"Shadow\\"; \\"Checkpoint\\"; \\"Blood Ties\\"; \\"I Was Made to Love You\\"; \\"Forever\\"; \\"Intervention\\"; \\"Tough Love\\"; \\"Spiral; \\"The Weight of the World\\"; \\"The Gift\\" (killed) * Season 7: \\"Lessons\\" (as an incarnation of The First Evil) Merchandise The character's popularity prompted Diamond Select Toys to release two unique Glory action figures in 2006 and 2007: one figure is modeled on the character wearing her trademark red dress, and the other features the character dressed in black, as seen in \\"The Gift\\". The latter action figure was released as part of a set, with the other figure being Dawn from the same episode.

Jet-powered aircraft VFW 614 In 1961 work began on a small, jet-powered aircraft initially styled Erno-61-4. After Weserflug and Focke Wulf formally merged into Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) in 1964, the machine was redesignated VFW 614. The draft design was amended to a STOL 40-44 passenger jet with overwing engines, for easier operation from unprepared runways. German government subsidies enabled development to start in earnest in 1966. The first prototype started in August 1968, but then VFW and Fokker of the Netherlands formed a joint transnational holding company. The prototype flew on 14 July 1971 but crashed next February. Two more prototypes flew in 1972. German, FAA, and French DGA certifications completed in 1974, 1975, & 1976 respectively. The collaborative production arrangements involved Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB) in Germany, Fokker VFW in the Netherlands and SABCA and Avions Fairey in Belgium. The first sale was to Cimber Air, which started commercial flights in November 1975. The VFW-Fokker alliance affected the VFW 614 negatively, as Fokker needed to sell its competing F27 and F28. National subsidies were diverted to the Airbus program, and the end came for the VFW 614. On 19 August 1977 the nineteenth (including prototypes) and last machine was completed. Few VFW 614 aircraft remained in use: The German Luftwaffe (Koln/Bonn Flugbereitschaft) continued flying VFW 614 until they finally ceased in 1998. The Luftwaffe machines went on to serve EADS/Airbus at Bremen (one aircraft for fly-by-wire development for the A380), and DLR in Braunschweig for development and research duties ‚Äì the final flight of the last airworthy VFW 614 was on 7 December 2012. Space activities =Helios, TD = ERNO participated in several satellite programs mostly being responsible for structure and thermal control, propulsion. A mechanically very challenging item i.e. the antenna of the German satellite HELIOS was manufactured by ERNO. =Spacelab= The European Space Agency ESA in June 1974 named a consortium headed by ERNO-VFW Fokker (Zentralgesellschaft VFW- Fokker GmbH) to build pressurized modules called Spacelab. British Aerospace, under contract to ERNO-VFW Fokker, built five -long, unpressurized, U-shaped pallet segments. West Germany provided 53.3% of Spacelab's cost and fulfilled 52.6% of all Spacelab work contracts. ERNO VFW Fokker, in competition with MBB, submitted the winning design, and became the prime contractor for Spacelab. MBB in 1981 took over VFW Fokker. The ERNO plant in Bremen continued as the headquarters for Spacelab design, production management, component testing, and assembly. =COLUMBUS= The Bremen team of the new MBB-ERNO prepared the first COLUMBUS proposal as Prime Contractor based on the experiences gained on Spacelab. As next step MBB-ERNO became a section of Daimler-Benz called DASA (Daimler-Benz Aerospace). Following it became a part of EADS Astrium Space Transportation, then Airbus Defence and Space. The engineering team for manned space developments is responsible for Columbus operations and maintenance and involved in the development of the NASA Orion program.

He is a multiple winner of both Hugo and Nebula Awards, a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, and a Grand Master of SF. He has attended every Hugo Awards ceremony since the inaugural event in 1953. Biography =Early years= Silverberg was born to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York. A voracious reader since childhood, he began submitting stories to science fiction magazines during his early teenage years. He received a BA in English Literature from Columbia University, in 1956. While at Columbia, he wrote the juvenile novel Revolt on Alpha C (1955), published by Thomas Y. Crowell with the cover notice: \\"A gripping story of outer space\\". He won his first Hugo in 1956 as the \\"best new writer\\". That year Silverberg was the author or co-author of four of the six stories in the August issue of Fantastic, breaking his record set in the previous issue. For the next four years, by his own count, he wrote a million words a year, mostly for magazines and Ace Doubles. He used his own name as well as a range of pseudonyms during this era, and often worked in collaboration with Randall Garrett, who was a neighbour at the time. (The Silverberg/Garrett collaborations also used a variety of pseudonyms, the best- known being Robert Randall.) From 1956 to 1959, Silverberg routinely averaged five published stories a month, and he had over 80 stories published in 1958 alone. In 1959, the market for science fiction collapsed, and Silverberg turned his ability to write copiously to other fields, from historical non- fiction to softcore pornography. \\"Bob Silverberg, a giant of science fiction... was doing two [books] a month for one publisher, another for a second publisher, and the equivalent of another book for a magazine... He was writing a quarter of a million words a month\\" under many different pseudonyms including about 200 erotic novels published as Don Elliott. In a 2000 interview, Silverberg explained that the erotic fiction (published under the pseudonym \\"Don Elliott\\") > ... was undertaken at a time when I was saddled with a huge debt, at the age > of 26, for a splendid house that I had bought. There would have been no way > to pay the house off by writing science fiction ... so I turned out a slew > of quick sex novels. I never concealed the fact that I was doing them; it > made no difference at all to me whether people knew or not. It was just a > job. And it was, incidentally, a job that I did very well. I think they were > outstanding erotic novels. =Literary growth= In the mid-1960s, science fiction was becoming more serious and sophisticated. Frederik Pohl, then editing three science fiction magazines, offered Silverberg carte blanche in writing for them. Thus inspired, Silverberg returned to the field that gave him his start, paying far more attention to depth of character development and social background than he had in the past and mixing in elements of the modernist literature he had studied at Columbia. Silverberg continued to write rapidly‚ÄîAlgis Budrys reported in 1965 that he wrote and sold at least 50,000 words (\\"call it the equivalent of a commercial novel\\") weekly‚Äîbut the novels he wrote in this period are considered superior to his earlier work; Budrys in 1968 wrote of his surprise that \\"Silverberg is now writing deeply detailed, highly educated, beautifully figured books\\" like Thorns and The Masks of Time. Perhaps the first book to indicate the new Silverberg was To Open the Sky, a fixup of stories published by Pohl in Galaxy Magazine, in which a new religion helps people reach the stars. That was followed by Downward to the Earth, a story containing echoes of material from Joseph Conrad's work, in which the human former administrator of an alien world returns after the planet's inhabitants have been set free. Other acclaimed works of that time include To Live Again, in which the memories and personalities of the deceased can be transferred to other people; The World Inside, a look at an overpopulated future; and Dying Inside, a tale of a telepath losing his powers. In the August 1967 issue of Galaxy, Silverberg published a 20,000-word novelette called \\"Hawksbill Station\\". This story earned Silverberg his first Hugo and Nebula story award nominations.Silverberg, Robert (1968). Hawksbill Station, Berkley, p. 3 An expanded novel form of Hawksbill Station was published the following year. In 1969 Nightwings was awarded the Hugo for best novella. Silverberg won a Nebula award in 1970 for the short story \\"Passengers\\", two the following year for his novel A Time of Changes and the short story \\"Good News from the Vatican\\", and yet another in 1975 for his novella \\"Born with the Dead\\". =Later developments= After suffering through the stresses of a major house fire and a thyroid malfunction, Silverberg moved from his native New York City to the West Coast in 1972, and he announced his retirement from writing in 1975. In 1980 he returned, however, with Lord Valentine's Castle, a panoramic adventure set on an alien planet, which has become the basis of the Majipoor series‚Äîa cycle of stories and novels set on the vast planet Majipoor, a world much larger than Earth and inhabited by no fewer than seven different species of settlers. In a 2015 interview Silverberg said that he did not intend to write any more fiction. Silverberg received a Nebula award in 1986 for the novella Sailing to Byzantium, which takes its name from the poem by William Butler Yeats; a Hugo in 1987 for the novella Gilgamesh in the Outback, set in the Heroes in Hell universe of Bangsian Fantasy; a Hugo in 1990 for Enter a Soldier. Later: Enter Another. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Silverberg in 1999, its fourth class of two deceased and two living writers, and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made him its 21st SFWA Grand Master in 2005. Personal life Silverberg has been married twice. He and Barbara Brown married in 1956, separated in 1976, and divorced a decade later. Silverberg and science fiction writer Karen Haber married in 1987. They live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Before the age of 30, Silverberg was independently wealthy through his investments and once owned the former mansion of New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.

It can be controlled through a user interface provided by one of many separate front-ends, including a Web interface, telnet interface and over a dozen native client programs. Originally a Linux client for the eDonkey protocol, it now runs on many flavors of Unix-like, OS X, Microsoft Windows and MorphOS and supports numerous peer-to-peer protocols. It is written in OCaml, with some C and some assembly.  History  Development of the software began in late 2001. The original developer of MLDonkey is Fabrice Le Fessant from INRIA. It was originally conceived as an effort to spread the use of OCaml in the open source community. In January 2003, Slyck.com reported brief friction between MLDonkey developers and the official Overnet MetaMachine developers, which denounced MLDonkey as a \\"rogue client\\", allegedly for incorrect behavior on the network. Versions before 3.0 have a known security vulnerability that allows an attacker with access to the web interface to read any file on the file system.  Features  Features of MLdonkey core: * Peer to peer (p2p) program that supports the following network protocols, either partially or completely: ** FastTrack (Kazaa) ** eDonkey network (with Overnet and Kad Network) ** BitTorrent (with DHT) ** Direct Connect ** HTTP/FTP * Multiple control interfaces: telnet, web interface, third party GUIs. Written in the OCaml programming language and licensed under the GPL, the application separates the user interface (which can be a web browser, telnet, or a third- party GUI application) and the code that interacts with the peer-to-peer networks. MLDonkey is able to connect simultaneously to different peers using different network protocols. In addition it can download and merge parts of one file from different network protocols although this feature is currently documented as experimental.

There were no decisive engagements, and the war ended in a stalemate. During the war, Macedon attempted to gain control over parts of Illyria and Greece, but without success. It is commonly thought that these skirmishes in the east prevented Macedon from aiding the Carthaginian general Hannibal in the war with Rome. The Peace of Phoenice (205 BC) formally ended the war. Demetrius urges war against Rome Rome's preoccupation with its war against Carthage provided an opportunity for Philip V of Macedon to attempt to extend his power westward. According to the ancient Greek historian Polybius, an important factor in Philip's decision to take advantage of this opportunity was the influence of Demetrius of Pharos. After the First Illyrian War (229-228 BC) the Romans had made Demetrius ruler of most of coastal Illyria.Polybius, 2.11. In the decade after the war he turned against the Romans attacking their allies in Illyria and raiding their trade vessels. In 219 BC, during the Second Illyrian War he was defeated by the Romans and fled to the court of king Philip.Polybius, 3.16, 3.18‚Äì19, 4.66. Involved in a war with the Aetolians, Philip learned of the victory of Hannibal over the Romans, at Lake Trasimene in June 217 BC. Philip at first showed the letter only to Demetrius. Perhaps seeing a chance to recover his kingdom, Demetrius immediately advised the young king to make peace with the Aetolians and turn his attentions toward Illyria and Italy. Polybius quotes Demetrius as saying: :For Greece is already entirely obedient to you, and will remain so: the Achaeans from genuine affection; the Aetolians from the terror which their disasters in the present war have inspired them. Italy, and your crossing into it, is the first step in the acquirement of universal empire, to which no one has a better claim than yourself. And now is the moment to act when the Romans have suffered a reverse.Polybius, 5.101. Philip was easily persuaded.Polybius, 5.102. Philip makes peace with Aetolia Philip at once began negotiations with the Aetolians. At a conference on the coast near Naupactus, Philip met the Aetolian leaders and a peace treaty was concluded.Polybius, 5.103‚Äì-105. Polybius quotes the Aetolian Agelaus of Naupactus as having given the following speechPolybius, 5.103. in favor of peace: The ancient Region of Aetolia, Greece The Greek Leagues and Kingdom of Macedonia :The best thing of all is that the Greeks should not go to war with each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all speaking with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, they may be able to repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.Polybius, 5.104. According to Walbank, p. 66, note 5, this speech, \\"nonwithstanding rhetorical elements ‚Ä¶ bears the mark of a true version based on contemporary record.\\" Philip builds a fleet Philip spent the winter of 217‚Äì216 BC building a fleet of 100 warships and training men to row them and, according to Polybius, it was a practice that \\"hardly any Macedonian king had ever done before\\".Polybius, 5.109. Macedon probably lacked the resources to build and maintain the kind of fleet necessary to match the Romans.Walbank, p. 69; Polybius, 5.1, 5.95, 5.108. Polybius says that Philip had no \\"hope of fighting the Romans at sea\\", perhaps referring to a lack of experience and training. At any rate, Philip chose to build lembi. These were the small fast galleys used by the Illyrians. They had a single bank of oars and were able to carry 50 soldiers in addition to the rowers.Wilkes, p. 157; Polybius, 2.3. With these, Philip could hope to avoid or evade the Roman fleet, preoccupied as he hoped it would be with Hannibal, and based as it was at Lilybaeum in western Sicily. Philip had in the meantime expanded his territories west along the Apsus and Genusus river valleys, right up to the borders of Illyria.Polybius, 5.108. Philip's plan was, it seems, to first take the Illyrian coasts, conquer the area between the coasts and Macedon, and use the new land link to provide a rapid route for reinforcements across the narrow straits to Italy.Walbank, p. 69. At the beginning of summer, Philip and his fleet left Macedon, sailed through the Euripus Strait, between the island of Euboea and Boeotia on the Greek mainland, and then rounded Cape Malea, before dropping anchor off the Islands of Cephalenia and Leucas, to await word of the location of the Roman fleet. Informed that it was still at Lilybaeum, he sailed north to Apollonia in Illyria. However, as the Macedonian fleet neared the island of Sazan, Philip heard a report that some Roman quinqueremes had been seen headed for Apollonia. Convinced that the entire Roman fleet was sailing to apprehend him, Philip ordered an immediate return to Cephalenia. Polybius speaks of \\"panic\\" and \\"disorder\\" to describe the fleet's hasty retreat and says that, in fact, the Romans had sent only a squadron of ten ships and that because of \\"inconsiderate alarm\\", Philip had missed his best chance to achieve his aims in Illyria, returning to Macedon, \\"without loss indeed, but with considerable dishonour\\".Polybius, 5.110. Philip allies with Carthage After hearing of Rome's disastrous defeat at the hands of Hannibal at Cannae in 216 BC, Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy to negotiate an alliance. There they concluded in the summer of 215 BC a treaty, the text of which is given by Polybius. In it they pledge, in general terms, mutual support and defense and to be enemies to each other's enemies (excepting current allies). Specifically, they promised support against Rome and that Hannibal shall have the right to make peace with Rome, but that any peace would include Philip and that Rome would be forced to relinquish control of Corcyra, Apollonia, Epidamnus, Pharos, Dimale, Parthini, and Atintania and \\"to restore to Demetrius of Pharos all those of his friends now in the dominion of Rome.\\"Polybius, 7.9. The treaty as set down by Polybius makes no mention of an invasion of Italy by Philip, the d√©b√¢cle at Sazan perhaps having soured Philip on such a ventureAccording to Walbank, p. 71, note 1, the version of the treaty described in Livy, 23.33.9‚Äì12, which mention an Italian invasion by Philip, \\"are worthless annalistic fabrications\\". ‚Äî something which in any case Hannibal may not have desired.Walbank, p. 69, note 3. On their way back to Macedon, Philip's emissaries, along with emissaries from Hannibal, were captured by Publius Valerius Flaccus, commander of the Roman fleet patrolling the southern Apulian coast. A letter from Hannibal to Philip, and the terms of their agreement, were discovered.Livy, 23.34. Philip's alliance with Carthage caused immediate dismay in Rome, hard-pressed as they already were. An additional twenty-five warships were at once outfitted and sent to join Flaccus' fleet of twenty-five warships already at Tarentum, with orders to guard the Italian Adriatic coast, to try to determine Philip's intent and, if necessary, cross over to Macedonia, keeping Philip confined there.Livy, 23.38. Livy says that 20 ships were outfitted and, along with the five ships that transported the agents to Rome, were sent to join Flaccus' fleet of 25 ships. In the same passage he says that 30 ships left Ostia for Tarentum and talks about a combined fleet of 55. Walbank, p. 75, note 2, says that the 55 number given by Livy is a mistake, citing \\"Holleaux, 187, n. 1.\\" War breaks out in Illyria In the late summer of 214 BC, Philip again attempted an Illyrian invasion by sea, with a fleet of 120 lembi. He captured Oricum which was lightly defended, and sailing up the Aous (modern Vjos√´) river he besieged Apollonia.Walbank, p. 75; Livy, 24.40. Meanwhile, the Romans had moved the fleet from Tarentum to Brundisium to continue the watch on the movements of Philip and a legion had been sent in support, all under the command of the Roman propraetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus.Livy, 24.10‚Äì11, 20. Upon receiving word from Oricum of events in Illyria, Laevinus crossed over with his fleet and army. Landing at Oricum, Laevinus was able to retake the town with little fighting. In the account given by Livy,Livy, 24.40. Livy's account is suspect, see Walbank, p. 76, note 1. Laevinus, hearing that Apollonia was under siege, sent 2000 men under the command of Quintus Naevius Crista, to the mouth of the river. Avoiding Philip's army, Crista was able to enter the city by night unobserved. The following night, catching Philip's forces by surprise, he attacked and routed their camp. Escaping to his ships in the river, Philip made his way over the mountains and back to Macedonia, having burned his fleet and leaving behind many thousands of his men that had died or been taken prisoner, along with all of his armies' possessions. Meanwhile, Laevinus and his fleet wintered at Oricum. Twice thwarted in his attempts at invasion of Illyria by sea, and now constrained by Laevinus' fleet in the Adriatic, Philip spent the next two years (213‚Äì212 BC) making advances in Illyria by land. Keeping clear of the coast, he took the inland towns of Atintania and Dimale, and subdued the GreekSmith, William (2006).

J. The Illyrians, 1992,,,Page 98,\\"... North of Dassaretis in the middle and upper valley of the Genusus was the territory of the Illyrian Parthini, likely to have been part of the Taulantii until they first appear as Roman allies late in the third century...\\" and at least the southern Ardiaei.Walbank p. 80; Livy, 27.30, 29.12. He was finally able to gain access to the Adriatic by capturing Lissus and its seemingly impregnable citadel, after which the surrounding territories surrendered.Polybius, 8.15‚Äì16. Perhaps the capture of Lissus rekindled in Philip hopes of an Italian invasion.Livy, 24.13, 25.23. However the loss of his fleet meant that Philip would now be dependent on Carthage for passage to and from Italy, making the prospect of invasion considerably less appealing. Rome seeks allies in Greece Desiring to prevent Philip from aiding Carthage in Italy and elsewhere, Rome sought out allies in Greece. Laevinus had begun exploring the possibility of an alliance with the Aetolian League as early as 212 BC.Walbank, p. 82; Livy, 25.30, 26.24. The war weary Aetolians had made peace with Philip at Naupactus in 217 BC. However, five years later the war faction was on the ascend and the Aetolians were once again considering taking up arms against their traditional enemy, Macedonia. In 211 BC an Aetolian assembly was convened for discussions with Rome. Laevinus pointed out the recent capture of Syracuse and Capua in the war against Carthage as evidence of Rome's rising fortunes and offered to ally with them against the Macedonians. A treaty was signed whereby the Aetolians would conduct operations on land, the Romans at sea and Rome would keep any slaves and other booty taken and Aetolia would receive control of any territory acquired. Another provision of the treaty allowed for the inclusion of certain allies of the League: Elis, Sparta, Messenia and Attalus I of Pergamon, as well as two Roman clients, the Illyrians Pleuratus and Scerdilaidas.Livy, 26.40. According to Walbank, p. 84, note 2, \\"Livy accidentally omits Messenia and erroneously describes Pleuratus as king of Thrace.\\" Campaign in Greece Later that summer, Laevinus seized the main town of Zacynthus, except for its citadel, the Acarnanian town of Oeniadae and the island of Nasos, which he handed over to the Aetolians. He then withdrew his fleet to Corcyra for the winter.Livy, 26.24. Upon hearing of the Roman alliance with Aetolia, Philip's first action was to secure his northern borders. He conducted raids in Illyria at Oricum and Apollonia and seized the frontier town of Sintia in Dardania or perhaps Paionia. He then marched rapidly south through Pelagonia, Lyncestis and Bottiaea and on to Tempe which he garrisoned with 4,000 men. He turned north again into Thrace, attacking the Maedi and their chief city Iamphorynna before returning to Macedon. No sooner had Philip arrived there when he received an urgent plea for help from his ally the Acarnanians. Scopas the Aetolian strategos (general) had mobilized the Aetolian army and was preparing to invade Acarnania. Desperate and overmatched, but determined to resist, the Acarnanians sent their women, children and old men to seek refuge in Epirus and the rest marched to the frontier, having sworn an oath to fight to the death, \\"invoking a terrible curse\\" upon any who were forsworn. Hearing of the Acarnanians' grim determination, the Aetolians hesitated then, learning of Philip's approach, finally abandoned their invasion, after which Philip retired to Pella for the winter.Livy, 26.25; Polybius, 9.40. In the spring of 210 BC, Laevinus again sailed from Corcyra with his fleet and, together with the Aetolians, captured Phocian Anticyra. Rome enslaved the inhabitants and Aetolia took possession of the town.Livy, 26.26; Polybius, 9.39. Livy says that Anticyra was Locrian, but modern scholars disagree, see Walbank, p. 87, note 2. Although there was some fear of Rome and concern with her methods,Polybius, 9.37‚Äì39, 10.15. the coalition arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon.Polybius, 9,30. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land by the rest of the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.Livy, 26.28. However, the Eleans, Messenians and Spartans remained passive throughout 210 BC and Philip continued to make advances. He invested and took Echinus, using extensive siegeworks, having beaten back an attempt to relieve the town by the Aetolian strategos Dorimachus and the Roman fleet, now commanded by the proconsul Publius Sulpicius Galba.Polybius, 9.41‚Äì42. Moving west, Philip probably also took Phalara the port city of Lamia, in the Maliac Gulf. Sulpicius and Dorimachus took Aegina, an island in the Saronic Gulf, which the Aetolians sold to Attalus, the Pergamene king, for thirty talents, and which he was to use as his base of operations against Macedon in the Aegean Sea. In the spring of 209 BC, Philip received requests for help from his ally the Achaean League in the Peloponnesus who were being attacked by Sparta and the Aetolians. He also heard that Attalus had been elected one of the two supreme commanders of the Aetolian League, as well as rumors that he intended to crossover the Aegean from Asia Minor.Livy, 27.29. Philip marched south into Greece. At Lamia he was met by an Aetolian force, supported by Roman and Pergamene auxiliaries, under the command of Attalus' colleague as strategos, the Aetolian Pyrrhias. Philip won two battles at Lamia, inflicting heavy casualties on Pyrrhias' troops. The Aetolians and their allies were forced to retreat inside the city walls, where they remained, unwilling to give battle. Attempt at peace fails From Lamia, Philip went to Phalara where he met representatives from the neutral states of Egypt, Rhodes, Athens and Chios who were trying to end the war. As trading states, the war was likely hurting trade;Walbank, p. 89‚Äì90. Livy says that they were concerned \\"not so much for the Aetolians, who were more warlike than the rest of the Greeks, as for the liberty of Greece, which would be seriously endangered if Philip and his kingdom took an active part in Greek politics.\\" With them was Amynandor of Athamania, representing the Aetolians. A truce of thirty days and a peace conference at Achaea were arranged. Philip marched to Chalcis in Euboea, which he garrisoned to block Attalus' landing there, then continued on to Aegium for the conference. The conference was interrupted by a report that Attalus had arrived at Aegina and the Roman fleet was at Naupactus. The Aetolian representatives, emboldened by these events, at once demanded that Philip return Pylos to the Messenians, Atintania to Rome and the Ardiaei to Scerdilaidas and Pleuratus. \\"Indignant\\", Philip quit the negotiations telling the assembly that they \\"might bear him witness that whilst he was seeking a basis for peace, the other side were determined to find a pretext for war\\".Livy, 27.30. Hostilities resume From Naupactus, Sulpicius sailed east to Corinth and Sicyon, conducting raids there. Philip, with his cavalry, caught the Romans ashore and was able to drive them back to their ships, with the Romans returning to Naupactus. Philip then joined Cycliadas, the Achaean general, near Dyme for a joint attack on the city of Elis, the main Aetolian base of operations against Achaea.Livy, 27.31. However, Sulpicius had sailed into Cyllene and reinforced Elis with a force of 4,000 Roman troops. Leading a charge, Philip was thrown from his horse. Fighting on foot, Philip became the object of a fierce battle, finally escaping on another horse. The next day, Philip captured the stronghold of Phyricus, taking 4,000 prisoners and 20,000 animals. Hearing news of Illyrian incursions in the north, Philip abandoned Aetolia and returned to Demetrias in Thessaly.Livy, 27.32. Meanwhile, Sulpicius sailed round into the Aegean and joined Attalus on Aegina for the winter.Livy, 27.33. In 208 BC the combined fleet of thirty-five Pergamene and twenty-five Roman ships failed to take Lemnos, but occupied and plundered the countryside of the island of Peparethos (Skopelos), both Macedonian possessions.Livy, 28.5. Attalus and Sulpicius then attended a meeting in Heraclea Trachinia of the Council of the Aetolians, which included representatives from Egypt and Rhodes, who were continuing to try to arrange a peace. Learning of the conference and the presence of Attalus, Philip marched rapidly south in an attempt to break up the conference and catch the enemy leaders, but arrived too late.Polybius, 10.42; Livy, 28.5. Surrounded by foes, Philip was forced to adopt a defensive policy.Polybius, 10.41; Livy, 28.5. He distributed his commanders and forces and set up a system of beacon fires at various high places to communicate instantly any enemy movements. After leaving Heraclea, Attalus and Sulpicius sacked both Oreus on the northern coast of Euboea, and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris.Livy, 28.6. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. However, with their forces divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships. The war ends Although Philip considered Attalus' escape a bitter defeat,Polybius, 11.7; Livy, 28.7. it proved to be the turning point of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps at the urging of Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina, so free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris,Livy, 28.7; Walbank, p. 96. and took back control of Oreus.Livy, 28.8. The neutral trading powers were still trying to arrange a peace and, at Elateia, Philip met with the same would-be peacemakers from Egypt and Rhodes who had been at the previous meeting in Heraclea, and again in the spring of 207 BC, but to no avail.Livy, 28.7. Representatives of Egypt, Rhodes, Byzantium, Chios, Mytilene and perhaps Athens also met again with the Aetolians that spring.Polybius, 11.4. The war was going Philip's way, but the Aetolians, although now abandoned by both Pergamon and Rome, were not yet ready to make peace on Philip's terms. However, after another season of fighting, they finally relented. In 206 BC, and without Rome's consent, the Aetolians sued for a separate peace on conditions imposed by Philip. The following springAccording to Walbank, p. 102, note 2, Livy, 29.12 \\"is spoilt by annalistic contamination, which, in the interests of Roman policy, tries to run the Aetolian peace and the return of the Romans as closely together as possible\\". the Romans sent the censor Publius Sempronius Tuditanus with 35 ships and 11,000 men to Dyrrachium in Illyria, where he incited the Parthini to revolt and laid siege to Dimale. However, when Philip arrived, Sempronius broke off the siege and withdrew inside the walls of Apollonia. Sempronius tried unsuccessfully to entice the Aetolians to break their peace with Philip. With no more allies in Greece, but having achieved their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal, the Romans were ready to make peace. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205 BC, the so-called \\"Peace of Phoenice,\\" which formally ended the First Macedonian War.Livy, 29.12.

Philip was defeated and was forced to abandon all possessions in southern Greece, Thrace and Asia Minor. During their intervention, although the Romans declared the \\"freedom of the Greeks\\" against the rule from the Macedonian kingdom, the war marked a significant stage in increasing Roman intervention in the affairs of the eastern Mediterranean, which would eventually lead to Rome's conquest of the entire region. Background Didrachm of Philip V of Macedon Attalus I of Pergamon. In 204 BC King Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt died, leaving the throne to his six-year-old son Ptolemy V. Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus the Great of the Seleucid Empire decided to exploit the weakness of the young king by taking Ptolemaic territory for themselves and they signed a secret pact defining spheres of interest, opening the Fifth Syrian War. Philip first turned his attention to the independent Greek city states in Thrace and near the Dardanelles. His success at taking cities such as Kios worried the state of Rhodes and King Attalus I of Pergamon who also had interests in the area. In 201 BC, Philip launched a campaign into Asia Minor, besieging the Ptolemaic city of Samos and capturing Miletus. Again, this disconcerted Rhodes and Attalus and Philip responded by ravaging Attalid territory and destroying the temples outside the walls of Pergamon.Didodorus XXVIII 5 Philip then invaded Caria but the Rhodians and Pergamenians successfully blockaded his fleet in Bargylia, forcing him to spend the winter with his army in a country which offered very few provisions. At this point, although they appeared to have the upper hand, Rhodes and Pergamon still feared Philip so much that they sent an appeal to the rising power of Rome, which had just emerged victorious from the Second Punic War against Carthage. The Romans had previously fought the First Macedonian War against Philip V over Illyria, which had been resolved by the Peace of Phoenice in 205 BC. Very little in Philip's recent actions in Thrace and Asia Minor could be said to concern the Roman Republic directly. The Senate passed a supportive decree and Marcus Valerius Laevinus was sent to investigate.Livy 31.3 Earlier in 201 BC, Athens' relations with Philip had suddenly deteriorated. A pair of Acarnanians had entered the Temple of Demeter during the Eleusinian Mysteries and the Athenians had put them to death. In response, the Acarnanian League launched a raid on Attica, aided by Macedonian troops which they had received from Philip V. Shortly after this, King Attalus I arrived in Athens with Rhodian ambassadors and convinced the Athenians, who had maintained strict neutrality since the end of the Chremonidean War, to declare war on Macedon. Attalus sailed off, bringing most of the Cycladic islands over to his side and sent embassies to the Aetolian League in the hope of bringing them into the war as well. In response to the Athenian declaration of war, Philip dispatched a force of 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry under the command of Philokles to invade Attica and place the city of Athens under siege.Livy 31.14-16 Course of the war =Rome enters the war (200 BC)= On 15 March 200 BC, new consuls, Publius Sulpicius Galba and Gaius Aurelius Cotta took office in Rome. In light of reports from Laevinus and further embassies from Pergamon, Rhodes, and Athens, the task of dealing with the troubles in Macedonia was allotted to Sulpicius. He called an assembly of the Comitia centuriata, the body with the legal power to make declarations of war. The Comitia nearly unanimously rejected his proposed war, an unprecedented act which was attributed to war weariness. At a second session, Sulpicius convinced the Comitia to vote for war.Livy 31.4-8 Sulpicius recruited troops and departed to Brundisium in the autumn, where he added veterans of the Second Punic War who had just returned from Africa to his forces. Then he crossed the Adriatic, landing his troops in Apollonia and stationing the navy at Corcyra.Livy 31.12-14 Siege of Abydos While these events had been taking place, Philip V himself had undertaken another campaign in the Dardanelles, taking a number of Ptolemaic cities in rapid succession before besieging the important city of Abydos. Polybius reports that during the siege of Abydos, Philip had grown impatient and sent a message to the besieged that the walls would be stormed and that if anybody wished to commit suicide or surrender they had three days to do so. The citizens promptly killed all the women and children of the city, threw their valuables into the sea and fought to the last man.Polybius, Histories XVI 30‚Äì31; Livy 31.16-17 During the siege of Abydos, in the autumn of 200 BC, Philip was met by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, a Roman ambassador on his way back from Egypt,He had been sent to Egypt to politely decline an offer by Ptolemy IV to send an army to protect Athens from Philip: Livy 31.9. who urged him not to attack any Greek state or to seize any territory belonging to Ptolemy and to go to arbitration with Rhodes and Pergamon. Philip protested that he was not in violation of any of the terms of the Peace of Phoenice, but in vain. As he returned to Macedonian after the fall of Abydos, he learnt of the landing of Sulpicius' force in Epirus.Diodorus 28.6; Livy 31.16-17 Cento's attack on Chalcis and Philip's invasion of Attica Map of Ancient Athens, with Dipylon Gate at top left. Tetradrachm of Perseus of Macedon. The Athenians, who were now besieged by Macedonian forces, sent an appeal to the Roman force in Corcyra. Gaius Claudius Centho was sent with 20 ships and 1,000 men to aid them. Philokles and his troops withdrew from Attica to their base in Corinth. In response to a request from Chalcidean exiles, Claudius led a surprise raid on the city of Chalcis in Euboea, one of the key Antigonid strongholds known as the 'fetters of Greece' and inflicting serious damage and heavy casualties.Livy 31.14, 22-3 Philip rushed to Chalcis with a force of 5,000 men and 300 cavalry. Finding that Claudius had already withdrawn, he sped on towards Athens, where he defeated the Athenian and Attalid troops in a battle outside the Dipylon Gate and encamped at Cynosarges. After setting fire to the sanctuaries and tombs outside the city walls, Philip departed to Corinth. From there, Philip went down to Argos where the Achaean League was holding an assembly, which he attempted to bring onto his side in exchange for supporting them in their ongoing conflict with Nabis of Sparta, but he was rebuffed. Joining up with a force of 2,000 men brought by his general Philokles, Philip made a series of three unsuccessful assaults on Eleusis, Piraeus, and Athens and ravaged the territory of Athens. Then he ravaged the sanctuaries throughout Attica and withdrew to Boeotia.Diodoros 28.7; Livy 31.23-26 The damage to the rural and deme sanctuaries of Attica was severe and marks the permanent end of their use., ch.6. Philip spent the rest of the winter preparing for the Roman assault. He sent his young son Perseus with a force to prevent the Romans and Dardanians from advancing over the ≈†ar Mountains into northern Macedonia. Philip had the settlements on the Sporades islands of Peparethos and Skiathos destroyed to prevent enemies using them as naval bases. The Macedonian army was gathered at Demetrias.Livy 31.28, 33 =Sulpicius and Villius' campaigns (200-199 BC)= Sulpicius' invasion of Upper Macedonia Route of Sulpicius' invasion of Upper Macedonia (green) During this time Sulpicius had established a firm base by the Seman river in Illyria. A force under Lucius Apustius was sent to raid the western border of Macedonia, capturing or razing a number of cities, including Antipatrea and Codrion. Following this expedition, Sulpicius received the allegiance of the Illyrians under Scerdilaidas, the Dardanians under Bato, and the Athamanes under Amynander. The diplomatic efforts of Philip, Sulpicius, and the Athenians centred on the Aetolian League, which seemed inclined to support the Romans but remained neutral at this stage.Livy 31.27-32 At the end of winter in 200 BC, Sulpicius led his troops east through the territory of the Dassaretae. Philip gathered 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, recalling the troops he had stationed in the north with Perseus, and marched west. He encamped on a hill near Athacus which overlooked Sulpicius' camp. After a series of indecisive skirmishes (in one of which Philip was nearly captured), news came that the Dardanians had invaded northern Macedonia, and the Macedonians withdrew secretly in the night.Livy 31.33-38 When he realised what had happened, Sulpicius set out in pursuit through Pelagonia, found Philip blocking the pass to Eordaea and forced it. Sulpicius ravaged Eordaea, then Elimeia to the south, and then followed the Haliacmon river valley up to Orestis, where he conquered Celetrum and Pelion and then returned to his base.Livy 31.39-40 Philip split his force, sending a contingent of his army north to deal with the Dardanian invasion, which it did, while he himself headed south. Roman naval campaign and Aetolian campaign At the same time as this land campaign set out, the Roman fleet had left Corcyra under command of Lucius Apustius, rounded Cape Malea, and rendezvoused with King Attalus near Hermione. The combined fleet then launched an assault on the Macedonian military base on the island of Andros and seized it for Pergamon. The fleet was joined by further ships from Issa and Rhodes and headed north to the Chalkidike peninsula where an assault on Cassandreia was a complete failure. They withdrew to northern Euboea, where they besieged and captured Oreus, another key Macedonian naval base. Since it was now autumn and the sailing season was drawing to a close, the contingents of the fleet dispersed back to their home ports.Livy 31.44-47 As these campaigns progressed, Damocritus, the strategos of the Aetolian League, had decided that it was time to join the war on the Roman side. Together with King Amynander, he led an invasion of Magnesia and Perrhaebia, then continued to ravage Thessaly. There, Philip suddenly appeared and completely defeated their force. He spent some time besieging the Aetolian city of Thaumaci, but gave up and withdrew as winter approached. He spent the winter training his army and engaging in diplomacy, particularly with the Achaean League.Livy 31.41-43, 32.4-5 Villius' campaign In Rome, the new consuls took office on 15 March 199 BC, Publius Villius Tappulus was allotted Macedonia as his province. He crossed the Adriatic to Corcyra, where he replaced Sulpicius in command of the army.Livy 32.1 On his arrival, Villius faced a mutiny by 2,000 troops, veterans of the Second Punic War who wished to be demobilised. He resolved this, by forwarding their concerns to the Senate, but was left with little time to prosecute a campaign.Livy 32.3 Philip marched west and encamped on both sides of the Ao√∂s river where it passed through a narrow ravine. Villius marched to meet him, but was still considering what to do when he learnt that his successor, Titus Quinctius Flamininus had been elected and was on his way to Corcyra to assume command.Livy 32.5-6 In Asia Minor, Pergamon was invaded by the Seleucid king Antiochus III. As a result, Attalus was not able to assist in the naval war in the Aegean until a Roman embassy forced Antiochus to withdraw.Livy 32.8, 27 =Flamininus' first campaign (198 BC)= Roman invasion of Thessaly Tetradrachm minted by or in honour of Titus Quinctius Flamininus. When the new consuls took office on 15 March 198, the Senate ordered the recruitment of 8,000 new infantry and 800 cavalry for the war. Command in Macedonia was allotted to Flamininus.Livy 32.8 He was not yet thirty and was a self-proclaimed Philhellene. Flamininus was delayed by religious matters for some time, but then he recruited the new forces, crossed the Adriatic, and dismissed Villius. The army encamped in the Aous Valley, across the river from Philip's for forty days.Livy 32.9 At a peace conference, Flamininus announced the Romans' new peace terms. Up to this point, the Romans had merely ordered Philip to stop attacking the Greek cities. Now Flamininus demanded that he should make reparations to all the Greek cities he had harmed and withdraw all his garrisons from cities outside Macedonia, including Thessaly, which had been part of the Macedonian kingdom continuously since 353 BC. Philip stormed out of the meeting in anger and Flamininus decided to attack.Diodorus XXVIII 11; Livy 32.10 In the subsequent Battle of the Aous, Flamininus was victorious despite the advantage the terrain gave to the Macedonian army, when he was shown a pass through the mountains which allowed him to send a force to attack the Macedonians from the rear. The Macedonian force collapsed and fled, suffering 2,000 casualties. Philip was able to gather up the survivors and retreat to Thessaly.Livy 32.10-12 There he destroyed the city of Tricca to prevent it falling into Roman hands and withdrew to Tempe.Livy 32.13 After the Roman victory, the Aetolians led a rapid attack through Ainis and into Dolopia, while King Amynander attacked and captured Gomphi, in the south-western corner of Thessaly. Meanwhile, Flamininus entered Epirus, which now joined the Roman side. Together with Amynander, he entered Thessaly.Livy 32.13-15 The army did not encounter much resistance at first, but he became caught up in a prolonged siege at Atrax. Eventually he was forced to abandon this siege and march south into Phocis in order to secure his supply lines and lodgings for winter by capturing Anticyra.Livy 32.18 He then besieged and captured Elateia.Livy 32.24 Roman naval campaign While this campaign was taking place, the consul's brother, Lucius Quinctius Flamininus had taken control of the Roman fleet and sailed to Athens. He rendezvoused with the Attalid and Rhodian fleets near Euboea. Eretria was taken after fierce fighting and Carystus surrendered, meaning that the entire island of Euboea was now under Roman control. The fleet travelled back around Attica to Cenchreae and placed Corinth under siege.Livy 32.16-17 From there, Lucius, Attalus, the Rhodians, and the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Achaian League in order to bring them into the war on the Roman side. The league held an assembly at Sicyon to decide how to respond, which was extremely contentious. On the one hand, the Achaians were still at war with Sparta and they were allied to Macedonia, but on the other hand their new chief magistrate Aristaenus was pro-Roman and the Romans promised to give the city of Corinth to the League. The representatives of Argos, Megalopolis, and Dyme, which all had particularly strong ties with Philip, left the meeting. The rest of the assembly voted to join the anti-Macedonian alliance.Livy 32.18-23 The Achaian army joined the other forces besieging Corinth, but after fierce fighting the siege had to be abandoned when 1,500 Macedonian reinforcements commanded by Philokles arrived from Boiotia.Livy 32.23 From Corinth, Philokles was invited to take control of Argos by pro-Macedonians in the city, which he did without a fight.Livy 32.25 Winter negotiations Over the winter of 198/197 BC, Philip declared his willingness to make peace. The parties met at Nicaea in Locris in November 198 - Philip sailed from Demetrias, but he refused to disembark and meet Flamininus and his allies on the beach, so he addressed them from the prow of his ship. To prolong the proceedings, Flamininus insisted that all his allies should be present at the negotiations. He then reiterated his demands that Philip should withdraw all his garrisons from Greece, Illyria, and Asia Minor. Philip was not prepared to go this far and he was persuaded to send an embassy to the Roman Senate. When this embassy reached Rome, the Senate demanded that Philip surrender the \\"fetters of Greece,\\" Demetrias, Chalcis, and Corinth, but Philip's envoys claimed they had no permission to agree to this, so the war continued.Livy 32.32-37 According to Polybius and Plutarch, these negotiations were manipulated by Flamininus - Philip's overtures had come just as elections were being held in Rome. Flamininus was eager to take the credit for ending the war but he did not yet know whether his command would be prolonged and had intended to make a quick peace deal with Philip, if it was not. He therefore dragged out the negotiations until he learnt that his command had been prorogued and then had his friends in Rome scupper the meeting in the Senate.Polybios XVII.12 Once this had become clear, Philip attempted to free up his forces by handing the city of Argos over to Nabis of Sparta, but Nabis then engineered a revolution in the city and organised a conference with Flamininus, Attalus and the Achaeans at Mycenae, at which he agreed to stop attacking the Achaeans and to supply troops to the Romans.Livy 32.38-40 =Flamininus' second campaign (197 BC)= Over the rest of the winter, Philip mobilised all the manpower of his kingdom including the aged veterans and the underage men, which amounted to 18,000 men. To these he added 4,000 peltasts from Thrace and Illyria, and 2,500 mercenaries. All these forces were gathered at Dion.Livy 33.3-4 Reinforcements were sent to Flamininus from Italy, numbering 6,000 infantry, 300 cavalry, and 3,000 marines.Livy 32.28 At the start of spring, Flamininus and Attalus went to Thebes to bring the Boeotian League into the coalition. Because Flamininus had managed to sneak 2,000 troops into the city, the assembly of the League had no choice but to join the Roman coalition. At the assembly, King Attalus suddenly suffered a stroke while giving a speech and was left paralysed on one side. He was eventually evacuated back to Pergamon, where he died later that year.Livy 33.1-2, 33.21 In June 197 BC, Flamininus marched north from Elateia through Thermopylae. En route, he was joined by forces from Aetolia, Gortyn in Crete, Apollonia, and Athamania.Livy 33.3 Philip marched south into Thessaly and the two armies encamped opposite each other near Pherae. Both armies relocated to the hills around Scotussa. Contingents of the opposing armies came into contact with one another in the Cynoscephalae hills, leading to a full battle. In what proved to be the decisive engagement of the war, the legions of Flamininus defeated Philip's Macedonian phalanx. Philip himself fled on horseback, collected the survivors, and withdrew to Macedonia. Philip was forced to sue for peace on Roman terms.Livy 33.5-11. Achaia, Acarnania, and Caria At the same time as this campaign was taking place in Thessaly, three other campaigns occurred in Achaea, Acarnania, and Caria - in all of which the Macedonians were defeated. In the Peloponnese, Androsthenes set out from Corinth with a Macedonian army of 6,000 men into the lands controlled by the Achaean League and pillaged the territories of Pellene, Phlius, Cleonae, and Sicyon. The Achaean general, Nicostratus, who was able to muster 5,000 men, closed off the pass back to Corinth, and defeated the Macedonian forces in detail.Livy 33.14-15 In Acarnania, there had been attempts to switch to the Roman side before the Battle of Cynoscephalae, but the League's assembly had eventually decided against this because of their hostility to the Aetolians. Lucius Flamininus therefore sailed to the Acarnanian capital of Leucas, and launched an all-out assault, which proved very difficult. Thanks to traitors inside the city, it was eventually captured. Shortly after this, news of the Battle of Cynoscephalae arrived and the rest of the Acarnanians surrendered.Livy 33.16-17 In Asia Minor, the Rhodians led a force of 4,500 mercenaries (mostly Achaeans) into Caria to recapture the Rhodian Peraia. A battle took place with the Macedonian forces in the area at Abanda, in which the Rhodians were victorious. The Rhodians then recaptured their Peraia, but failed to take Stratonicea.Livy 33.17-18 Aftermath =The Peace of Flamininus= An armistice was declared and peace negotiations were held in the Vale of Tempe. Philip agreed to evacuate the whole of Greece and relinquish his conquests in Thrace and Asia Minor.Livy 33.12-13 Philip had to rush off almost immediately after the agreement of terms to deal with an invasion of Upper Macedonia by the Dardanians.Livy 33.19 The treaty was sent to Rome for ratification. Despite the efforts of the consul-elect Marcus Claudius Marcellus to prolong the war, the Roman Tribal Assembly voted unanimously to make peace. The Senate sent ten commissioners to advise on the final peace terms, including Publius Sulpicius Galba and Publius Villius Tappulus.Livy 33.24-25. Others included Publius Cornelius Lentulus, Lucius Stertinius, Lucius Terentius Massaliota, Gnaeus Cornelius: Livy 33.35. On the advice of these men, the final peace was made with Philip in spring 196 BC. Philip had to remove all his garrisons in Greek cities in Europe and Asia, which were to be free and autonomous. Philip had to pay a war indemnity of 1,000 talents - half paid immediately and the rest in ten annual instalments of 50 talents. He had to surrender his whole navy except for his flagship, while his army was limited to a maximum of 5,000 men, could not include elephants, and could not be led beyond his borders without permission of the Roman Senate.Livy 33.30 =Boeotian campaign= Over the winter of 197/196 BC, while the peace negotiations were still ongoing, conflict had broken out in Boeotia, leading to the assassination of the pro- Macedonian Boeotarch Brachylles by the pro-Roman leaders Zeuxippus and Peisistratus. There was a strong popular backlash, resulting in the murder of about 500 Roman soldiers who had been billeted in Boeotia. Roman forces invaded Boeotia, but the Athenians and Achaeans managed to negotiate a settlement.Livy 33.27-33 =Aetolian response to the peace= At the initial peace negotiations, a rift opened up between Flamininus and the Aetolians, since the latter wanted harsher peace terms imposed on Philip than Flamininus was willing to countenance and desired the return of a number of cities that they had previously controlled in Thessaly but Flamininus refused to back them.Livy 33.12-13 The Aetolians began to claim that the Romans planned to retain garrisons in the \\"fetters of Greece\\" and replace the Macedonians as overlords of Greece.Livy 33.31 The growing Aetolian hostility to the Romans was expressed openly to one of the ten Roman commissioners at a meeting of Delphian Amphictyony in 196 BC.Livy 33.35 This conflict would ultimately lead to the Aetolian War in 191 BC. =The Freedom of the Greeks= Giuseppe Sciuti, Titus Quinctius offers the liberty to the Greeks, 1879, painting Possible bust of Antiochus III At the Isthmian Games of May 196 BC, Flamininus proclaimed the 'Freedom of the Greeks' met with general rejoicing of those who were attending the Games. The proclamation listed the free communities as follows: .Livy 33.31-33 Nevertheless, the Romans kept garrisons in key strategic cities which had belonged to Macedon ‚Äì Corinth, Chalcis and Demetrias ‚Äì and the legions were not completely evacuated until 194 BC. The extent of this grant of freedom was not entirely clear. Although Flamininus' proclamation had included a list of the communities formerly under Philip's control to which it applied,The Corinthians, Phocians, Locrians, Euboeans, Magnesians, Thessalians, Perrhaebians, and the Phthiote Achaeans: Livy 33.32 the Romans quickly assumed (or were thrust into) the role of protector of Greek freedom more generally. The rhetoric of Greek freedom was almost immediately employed by the Romans and their allies to justify diplomatic and military action elsewhere, with the War against Nabis of Sparta, which was undertaken in 195 BC, ostensibly for the sake of the freedom of Argos.Livy 34.22 =Seleucid conquest of Asia Minor= The initial background to the whole war had been the alliance of Antiochus III and Philip V against Ptolemy V and while the war had been raging in Greece, Antiochus III had completely defeated the Ptolemaic forces in Syria at the Battle of Panium. Since Philip had surrendered his claim to the communities in Asia Minor that had formerly been under Ptolemaic control, Antiochus III now advanced into Asia Minor to take them over for himself.Livy 33.34 The conflicts arising from this would lead to the outbreak of the Roman‚ÄìSeleucid War in 192 BC.

In 179 BC King Philip V of Macedon died and was succeeded by his ambitious son Perseus. He was anti-Roman and stirred anti-Roman feelings around Macedonia. Tensions escalated and Rome declared war on Macedon. Most of the war was fought in Macedon as well as neighbouring Thessaly, where the Roman troops were stationed. After an inconclusive battle at Callinicus in 171 BC, and several more years of campaigning, Rome decisively defeated the Macedonian forces at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, bringing the war to a close. Rome's victory ended the Antigonid dynasty and brought an effective end to the independence of the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedon, although formal annexation was still some years away. The kingdom was divided into four client republics, each subservient to Rome. Roman prestige and authority in Greece was greatly increased as a result. Background In 179 BC King Philip V of Macedon died and his ambitious son, Perseus, succeeded to the throne. In pursuit of an alliance, Perseus married Laodice, the daughter of Seleucus IV the king of the Seleucid Empire. Perseus' daughter was set to marry Prusias II of Bithynia (in north-western Anatolia, modern Turkey), who was an enemy of Eumenes II of Pergamon (in western Anatolia), an ally of Rome. Amid these alliances, Abrupolis, the king of the Thracian tribe of the Sapaei and an ally of the Romans attacked Macedon, laid it waste as far as Amphipolis, and overran the gold mines of Mount Pangaeus. He was repulsed and then driven out of his territories by Perseus. This conflict contributed to the tensions which led to the Third Macedonian War, because Rome took issue with the ousting of its ally. Perseus made an alliance with Cotys IV, the king of the Odrysian kingdom, the largest state in Thrace. He increased the size of his army. He also announced that he could carry out reforms in Greece and restore its previous strength and prosperity.Michael Grant (1978), The History of Rome, p. 120 Perseus sent agents to endeavour to gain support in the Greek states and in the Greek cities. He gained the support of Greeks who were treated generously, saw Perseus as their kindred, were keen on revolutionary change, or did not want to be at the mercy of Rome.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.5.5-6 Perseus' propaganda and political manoeuvres around Greece created significant political divisions within the Greek states and cities, which became caught up in bitter disputes between pro-Roman and pro-Perseus factions. At the beginning of 173 BC the Romans sent commissioners to Aetolia and Macedonia, but they were not given the opportunity to meet Perseus. The Romans felt that it was clear that he was making preparations for war and that it would not be long before he would take up arms. In the Aetolian cities there were increasingly violent internal conflicts and the leaders of the pro- Roman and pro-Perseus factions refused to keep this in check. A Roman envoy attended the session of the Aetolian council at Delphi. He asked both quarreling factions to abstain from war. This was agreed through an exchange of hostages, who were sent to Corinth. The envoy then went to the Peloponnese and called a meeting of the Achaean council. He praised the Achaeans for retaining an old decree forbidding the Macedonian kings to approach their territories, and clarified that Rome considered Perseus an enemy. There was also violent conflict in Thessaly and Perrhaebia (the land of the Perrhaebi, a tribe in northern Thessaly). This was exacerbated by a problem with indebtedness. Rome sent an envoy to try to defuse the situation. He managed to do so by addressing the serious problem of indebtedness \\"swollen by illegal interest\\" in both areas.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.2.1-2, 42.5.11-12, 42.5.5-6, 42.6.1-2 Eumenes II of Pergamon, who had been in conflict with Macedon and who disliked Perseus, made a speech in the senate in Rome with the aim of precipitating hostilities. The contents of the speech were kept secret and were leaked only after the end of the war. He claimed that Perseus had been preparing for war since the day of his accession. He was respected and feared in the east and had influence on many kings. He mentioned Prusias of Bithynia, who was an enemy of Pergamon, asking for the hand of Perseus‚Äô daughter. He also mentioned that Antiochus IV, the new Seleucid king, betrothed his daughter to Perseus as an example of Perseus gaining influence among kings in the east, even though Antiochus had just renewed an alliance with Rome which was made by his father. The Boeotians, had never made an alliance with Macedon, but now they were in a league with Perseus. Members of the Achaean council threatened to call on Rome in their opposition to an alliance with Perseus. Had it not been for this, such an alliance might have gone through. Perseus made preparations for war, storing corn for 30,000 troops. He had money to hire 10,000 mercenaries and could draw many soldiers from Thrace. He had been stocking weapons. He seized some places and persuaded others through favour. Eumenes II claimed that if Rome ignored these developments, Perseus might attack Italy.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.10.1, 42.11-14.1For Antiochus renewing the alliance with Rome see Livy, The History of Rome,42.6.5-12 A few days after Eumenes' speech the senate received envoys from Perseus. They said that Perseus had not said or done anything hostile. However, the senators did not believe this and \\"their ears had been captured by Eumenes\\". They felt affronted when the leader of the embassy said that if Perseus saw that the Romans were bent on an excuse for war, he would respond with courage and that \\"the chances of war were the same for both sides and the issue was uncertain.\\" When they returned to Macedon they told Perseus that the Romans were not preparing for war, but they were so embittered with him that they might do so soon. Perseus thought that this might be possible. He was determined to begin the war by shedding the blood of Eumenes, whom he hated, and called for Euander, a leader of Cretan mercenaries, and three Macedonian killers to arrange the assassination of Eumenes.42.14.2-4, 15.1-4 The cities of Greece and Asia (western and central Anatolia) were concerned about the events of Eumenes's speech and the envoys of Perseus. They thought that Eumenes was steering Rome towards war. They sent embassies to Rome. One of them was from Rhodes. It said that they felt sure that Eumenes had included Rhodes among those he accused of being friends of Perseus and, therefore, Rhodes had tried to confront Eumenes in the Roman senate. As this had failed, they accused Eumenes of trying to stir the Lycians (a people in western Anatolia who were under Eumenes' rule) against Rhodes and claimed that he was more oppressive in Asia than the Seleucid king had been.Before the Roman- Seleucid War (192‚Äì188 BC) the Seleucids were the masters of much of Asia. When Rome won the war, she gave the Seleucid territories in that area to Pergamon. The senators resented this claim. Hostility towards Eumenes by various Greek states made Rome more determined to show favour to him.Livy, The History of Rome, 14.5‚Äì10 Perseus had arranged for the assassination of Eumenes to take place during the latter's visit to Delphi, but the attempt failed. Gaius Valerius Valerius, who had been sent to investigate the situation in Greece and monitor Perseus, returned to Rome and agreed with the allegations Eumenes had brought to the senate. He also bought a woman who was involved in the failed plot and a Roman who claimed that Perseus had tried to coerce him into poisoning ambassadors to Rome. This intensified old enmities and led to Perseus being declared a public enemy, the Senate electing to wage war and the dispatch of an army to Apollonia on the western coast of Greece to occupy the coastal cities. The war was, however, put off for the year. Eumenes also prepared for war.Livy, The History of Rome, 14.5‚Äì10, 15, 17‚Äì18 Gentius, king of the Illyrians, had brought himself under suspicion, but had not gone so far as to decide for certain which side he should support. The Thracian Cotys IV, king of the Odrysian Kingdom, the largest state in Thrace, had already declared for Macedon.Livy, The History of Rome, 29.11‚Äì12  Preparations for war and diplomatic missions  The consuls for 171 BC were Publius Licinius Crassus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Macedon was assigned to Publius Licinius and the command of the fleet was assigned to the praetor Gaius Lucretius.Livy, The History of Rome, 22.28, 32, 35 Two legions were assigned for Macedon and the number of men for each was 6,000 instead of the usual 5,200, plus allied troops numbering 16,000 infantry and 800 cavalry. Envoys were sent to confer with the Greek states. They received the support of Epirus, in western Greece, and Aetolia and Thessaly, in central Greece. The main Boeotian cities, though divided between a pro-Roman and a pro-Perseus faction, decided to break the treaty with Perseus and sided with Rome. This caused the breakup of the league of Boeotian cities as some of them supported Perseus. In Rhodes a new leader persuaded the island to ally with Rome. Gentius, the king of Illyria, remained non-committal.Livy, The History of Rome, 42. 31.2-3, 32.5, 36-38.1-7, 43.4-10, 45, 46. 7-10 A commission was sent to Greece to examine the situation there. Perseus invited one of the commissioners, Marcius, for a meeting. He denounced the allegations of Eumenes and others and claimed that his international relations were not aimed at preparing for war. Marcius advised him to send an embassy to Rome and arranged an armistice to guarantee the safe passage of the envoys. He did this because it suited Rome as she was not ready for war. The army was being prepared and had not gone to Greece yet.Livy, The History of Rome, 42. 38.8-10, 39-43.1-3, 46.1-6 Many senators were pleased with the diplomatic achievements of the commissioners when they arrived to Rome. However, the older senators disapproved of the new policy of diplomacy, which they saw as not true to the honour and courage of the character of the Romans and called for military action. As a result, 50 ships were sent to Greece and 2,000 troops were sent to occupy Larissa, the capital of Thessaly, to prevent Perseus from garrisoning the city. The ambassadors of Perseus arrived in Rome to argue for peace. The senate was not persuaded by the arguments and they were ordered to leave Rome.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.47 Gaius Lucretius, the commander of the fleet, set off with 40 ships. He received ten vessels from allies in southern Illyria at Dyrrhachium (modern Durr√´s, Albania) and 54 light vessels from Gentius, which he assumed had been assembled for the Romans. He reached Cephallania (Cephalonia, an island in the Ionic Sea) where he was joined by seven ships from the Roman allies. He then went to the island of Corfu. The consul crossed the sea from Italy and encamped with his force near Apollonia, on the western coast of Greece.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.48, 49 Perseus assembled his whole army at Citium, a Macedonian town. He had 39,000 infantry, half of which were phalanxes (heavy infantry). There were 3,000 Cretans, 3,000 men from Agrianes, Paeonia and Parstrymonia (a Thracian area around the River Strymon, in modern Bulgaria), 3,000 Thracians, 2,000 Gauls and 500 men from various Greek states. There were also 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and 1,000 Thracian cavalry.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.51 The first year of the war (171 BC) Perseus marched to the land of the Perrhaebi in the northernmost district of Thessaly and seized all the main towns north of the River Peneus, which crosses northern Thessaly: Cyretiae, Mylae, Elatia and Gonnus. He encamped at Sycurium, between Mount Ossa and the lower Peneus. It overlooked the plains of Thessaly and was not far from Larissa. Meanwhile, Publius Licinius had marched from Epirus on the west coast of Greece through arduous mountain passes and through Athamania, a kingdom allied with Perseus. He was lucky that they were not attacked otherwise the green troops tired from their journey would have been defeated. He reached Thessaly and encamped at Tripolis Larisaia, five kilometres north of Larissa (the capital of Thessaly) and further up the River Peneus. He was joined by 4,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry brought by Eumenes II of Pergamon and 1,500 infantry and 600 cavalry.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.53-55, A contingent of the Roman fleet went through the Gulf of Corinth and conducted operations against the Boeotians. It besieged Haliartus with 10,000 mariners and 2,000 troops under one of the brothers of Eumenes II. Eventually the city fell; 2,500 fighters who had taken refuge in the citadel were sold as slaves and the place was razed.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.56.1-7, 63.3-12 Perseus sent a detachment twenty miles southward, to ravage the fields of Pherae, in southern Thessaly. He hoped that this would draw the Romans forward, but they did not respond. Perseus then appeared just over a mile from the Roman camp and, at 9 a.m., he sent forward a reconnaissance unit of 100 cavalry and 100 slingers. The Romans sent out a detachment of some 380 Gallic, Mysian and Cretan light cavalry. Perseus deployed only four cavalry squadrons and four infantry cohorts, and engaged the Roman detachment. Livy wrote that as the two forces were equal in numbers and \\"no fresh troops came up on either side, the engagement ended in a drawn battle.\\" Perseus then went back to his camp at Sycurium. It looked as though neither side wanted a large-scale battle and that for Perseus, this was more like a test. Moreover, his men had marched for twelve miles without water. Perseus returned the next day, and had water carts with him. He lined up before the Roman camp, but the Romans did not give battle. He returned several times, to the same spot, and at the same hour. He hoped that the Roman cavalry would sally to pursue his troops, so that he could attack it with his superior cavalry while it was away from the Roman camp. As this failed, he moved his camp five miles away from the Roman camp. The next day, he lined up for battle at dawn. As this was earlier than he had usually done, it surprised the Romans. Perseus engaged the Romans by a hill called Callinicus.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.56.7-9, 57-58.1-3 =Battle of Callinicus= Perseus' left wing contained Thracians intermixed with cavalry and the right wing consisted of the Cretan infantry intermixed with the Macedonian cavalry. The wings were flanked by a mix of Macedonian cavalry and allied troops of various nationalities. In the centre there was the ‚Äúsacred‚Äù cavalry with slingers and javelin throwers in front of them. Publius Licinius lined up the heavy infantry inside the rampart and the light infantry and the cavalry in front of it. The right wing had light infantry intermixed with the Roman cavalry and the left wing had the light infantry and cavalry of Greek allies. In the centre there were select cavalrymen with the troops of Eumenes II, 200 Gauls and 300 Cyrtians. The Thessalian cavalry of 400 was a short distance in front of them. Eumenes II, his brother Attalus, and their infantry were in the rear, just in front of the rampart. The numbers of the two armies were even.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.58 The battle was started by the slingers and javelin throwers. Then the Thracians attacked the Roman cavalry on the right wing, throwing it into confusion. The infantry on both sides cut the lances of the horsemen and stabbed the sides of the horses. Perseus‚Äô centre pushed back the Greeks on the left wing. The Thessalian cavalry, which had been kept in reserve, joined the men of Eumenes II at the rear and their combined ranks provided a safe retreat for the allied cavalry. As the enemy slackened in their pursuit, the Thessalians ventured forward to protect the retreating foot soldiers. The Macedonian forces, which in the course of the pursuit had become spread out, did not come close to the enemy which was advancing in compact formation. The Macedonian phalanx now came forward without having been ordered to do so by Perseus. The Roman infantry came out of the rampart. On seeing it advancing, Euander, the commander of the Cretans, advised Perseus that continuing the battle was an unnecessary risk, and the king decided to withdraw. Despite this, the battle was considered a Macedonian victory because they lost 400 infantry and 20 cavalry, while the Romans lost 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry. On the advice of Eumenes, Publius Licinius moved his camp to the other bank of the river for protection. In the Roman camp the Aetolians were blamed for beginning the panic which spread to the Greek troops, who fled following their example. Five Aetolian officers were sent to Rome. The Thessalians were commended for their bravery.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.59-60 Perseus moved his camp to Mopselus, a hill at the entrance of the Vale of Tempe which commanded the view of the plain of Larissa. Meanwhile, Misagenes (the son of Masinissa, king of Numidia) brought 1,000 Numidian cavalry, the same number of infantry and 22 elephants for the Romans. Perseus was advised to use the victory to secure an honourable peace. This would make him look moderate and if the Romans rejected it, they would look arrogant. Perseus approved. Envoys were sent to the consul. They promised to pay tribute which would be negotiated. The reply was that peace would be granted only if Perseus put himself in the hands of Rome and gave her the right to determine his future and that of Macedon. Perseus hoped to buy the peace by various offers of higher and higher sums of money, but Publius Licinius turned them down. Perseus returned to Sycurium, preparing to resume hostilities. Meanwhile, the Romans in Boeotia, having taken Haliartus moved to Thebes, which surrendered without fighting. The city was given to the pro-Roman party and the property of the pro- Macedonians was sold.Livy, The History of Rome, 42. 61.10-11, 62, 63 Perseus thought that the fact that the Romans were harvesting the corn and dumping straw in front of their camp was a good opportunity to torch the camp. However, his night incursion was discovered. Perseus withdrew and there were some skirmishes with pursuing Romans. The Romans moved to Crannon (modern Krannonas, to the south-east of Larissa) to reap more corn. They saw Perseus‚Äô cavalry and infantry on the hills overlooking the camp. As the Romans did not move he went back to Sycurium.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.64 The Romans moved to Phalanna (the capital of the Perrhaebi of northern Thessaly) for further harvesting. Perseus learnt that they were dispersed and no one was guarding the camp. He hurried with 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 Thracian and Cretan light infantry and caught the Romans by surprise. He captured nearly 1,000 carts and 600 men. Then he attacked a detachment of 800 Romans, which withdrew on a hill and formed a circle with interlocked shields as a protection against javelins. The Macedonians surrounded the hill, but could not make their way up. The Macedonians used cestrosphendons, a weapon which had just been invented. It was like a dart with feathers round the shaft shot by a sling held by two thongs. The slinger whirled it and it flew off. The Romans were getting tired and Perseus urged them to surrender. Pulbius Licinius was informed and he hurried with a force of light infantry and cavalry, including the Numidians and the elephants, followed by more troops.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.65 Perseus called in the heavy infantry, but it was too late. The infantry arrived in a hurry and was not properly arrayed. Publius Licinius attacked and Perseus lost 300 men and 24 of the ‚Äúsacred‚Äù cavalry, including its commander. The heavy infantry fled, but got tangled with the captured Romans and their carts in a narrow passage. Unable to get through, the men threw the carts down the hill. The king showed up and, to the soldiers‚Äô dismay, he ordered them to march back. Livy noted that according to some sources the consul returned to his camp, while according to others there was a big battle in which 8,000 of the enemies were killed, including two commanders, and 2,800 were captured and, while Romans lost 4,300 men.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.66 Perseus left a strong garrison in Gonnus (which was in the Vale of Tempe, at the entrance of Macedon) and then went back to Macedon for the winter. He sent a governor to Phila to try to win over the Magnetes (a tribe to the east of Thessaly) and went to Thessalonica with Cotys IV, the king of the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace and the commander of the Thracians. They heard that Autlebis, the chief of a Thracian tribe and one of Eumenes' commanders, had invaded one of Cotys' territories. Perseus let Cotys go to defend it and gave his cavalry only half of the year's pay. Publius Licinius heard that Perseus had gone, and attacked Gonnus in order to deny the Macedonians a convenient descent into Thessaly. However, he gave up because its citadel was impregnable. He took a number of towns in Perrhaebia, including Malloea and Tripolis, and returned to Larissa.Livy, The History of Rome, 42.67 The consul sent part of the army to various cities to winter, disbanded the forces of the Greek allies except for the Achaeans and sent Misagenes and his Numidians to the nearest cities in Thessaly. Eumenes and Attalus returned to Pergamon. He then went with part of his army south to Achaean Phthiotis where he razed Pteleum. Antronae surrendered. Livy wrote that then he went to Larissa, that the Macedonian garrison had fled and the inhabitants, who had taken refuge in the citadel, surrendered. However, he never previously mentioned that Larissa had been taken by the Macedonians and this sounds odd. After this Publius Licinius went to Boeotia, where Thebes was in trouble with another Boeotian city, Coronea, and asked for help. The commander sent to Illyria by the consul attacked two towns. He seized Cerenia and initially allowed the inhabitants to keep their belongings, in order to encourage the strongly fortified city of Carnuns to go over to him. However, he did not succeed and later sacked Cerenia. The other consul, Gaius Crassus, did not achieve much in northern Italy and tried unsuccessfully to go to Illyria and then attack Macedon. The senate was astonished that he left northern Italy exposed to possible attacks and sent envoys to warn him not to attack anyone without its authorisation.Livy, The History of Rome, 43.1 The second year of the war (170 BC) Livy wrote that the consul Publius Licinius, frustrated with his lack of success against Perseus, had turned against the Boeotians, mercilessly plundering several cities there, where he was wintering. The people of Coronea put themselves under the protection of the Senate, which ordered Licinius to release his captives. Gaius Lucretius, the commander of the fleet, was even more ruthless and rapacious, being described by Livy as ‚Äúoppressive to the allies, despicable in the sight of the enemy.‚Äù Perseus, in a surprise attack on the Roman fleet stationed at Oreum on the island of Euboea, captured five warships and twenty transports laden with corn and sunk the other ships. He then went to Thrace to help Cotys against the aforementioned invasion. Epirus, on the west coast of Greece, went over to the Macedonians.Livy, The History of Rome, 43.3-4 (Crevier supplement) The consuls for the year 170 BC were Aulus Hostilius Mancinus and Aulus Atilius Serranus. Macedon was assigned to Aulus Hostilius and the fleet and the coast of Greece to the praetor Gaius Hortensius. Aulus Hostilius was on his way to Macedon via Epirus. An Epirot leader wrote to Perseus to tell him to hurry there. However, the king was delayed. If he had attacked at the river passage, the newly recruited troops would have been defeated. In any case, Aulus Hostilius was informed about this and changed his route. He left Epirus and sailed to Anticyra (on the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, in Boeotia) and marched to Thessaly. He marched on the enemy straight away, but he was no more successful than his predecessor, being defeated in battle. Then he gave up his useless attempts first to force his way through Elimea in south-western Macedon and then secretly march through Thessaly. Perseus anticipated all his moves. Livy wrote that Gaius Hortensius did not conduct his naval operations ‚Äúwith sufficient skill or success, for none of his acts deserves better to be remembered than his cruel and perfidious plundering of the city of the Abdertes when they endeavoured to avert, by entreaty, the intolerable burdens imposed on them.‚Äù Perseus made an incursion against Dardania in southern Illyria, killed 10,000 and seized a large booty.Livy, The History of Rome, 43.3.6-7 (Crevier supplement) An embassy from Chalcis (the chief town of the island of Euboea) came to Rome to complain about both the naval commander of the previous year, Gaius Lucretius, for plundering the city, a friend of Rome, and the current naval commander, Lucius Hortensius, for keeping the rowdy sailors in lodgings in the town. Lucretius was put on trial and fined by the plebeian tribunes; the senate ordered Hortensius to free the men enslaved by Lucretius and not to let the sailors lodge on the island.A compensation was paid. Livy, The History of Rome, 43.7-8 It was suspected that Gentius, the king of Illyria, might side with Perseus. Therefore, the senate sent eight ships with 2,000 soldiers to Issa. Aulus Hostilius sent Appius Claudius to Illyria with 4,000 men to protect the neighbouring states. He gathered 8,000 soldiers form allies of various nationalities. He sent them to Lychnidus, in the territory of the Dassaretians, a tribe in Epirus. Messengers from the nearby Uscana in southern Illyria‚Äîa town allied with Perseus and garrisoned by Cretans‚Äîtold Appius Claudius that some people in the town were willing to hand it over to him. He neither asked for hostages as a safeguard nor sent scouts. He encamped near the city and set out at night, leaving 1,000 men to guard the camp. The troops were not well organised, being stretched out in a long and irregular line, and accordingly became separated in the dark. They did not see anyone on the walls as they approached. However, the defenders made a sortie, killing many of the Romans; only 1,000 men escaped. Appius took the remains of his force to Lychnidus without taking care of the men who had straggled.Livy, The History of Rome, 43.9.4-7, 10 This and other reverses were reported back to Rome. The senate ordered two deputies to gather information on the situation in Greece. The deputies reported the successes of Perseus and the fear of the Greek allies about Perseus reducing many cities. They also reported that the troops of the consul (Publius Licinius) were thin because he had granted leave to many of them, in order to gain popularity.Livy, The History of Rome, 43.11.1-2, 8-11  The third year of the war (169 BC)  =Opening Stages= The consuls for 169 BC were Quintus Marcius Philippus (for the second time) and Gnaeus Servilius Caepio. The Macedonian War was assigned to Quintus Marcius and the command of the fleet to the praetor Quintus Marcius Figulus.Livy, The History of Rome, 43.1.6, 15.2-3 The troops allocated for Greece were 6,000 Roman infantry, 6,000 Latin infantry, 250 Roman cavalry and 300 allied cavalry. The old soldiers were discharged, so each legion would have 6,000 soldiers. The soldiers who had been granted leave by the previous consul to curry favour were recalled. The recruitment for the fleet was 1,000 Roman freedmen and 500 Italians and 500 Sicilians.Livy, The History of Rome 43.11.6, 12.3-4, 9.1 When the snow covered the mountains of Thessaly, thus protecting Macedon from Roman attacks, Perseus decided to attack the Illyrians, who had granted free passage to the Romans. The Illyrian king, Gentius, had been wavering about whom to support. Perseus moved to the land of the Penestae (in southern Illyria) and went on to Stubera with 10,000 infantry, 2,000 light infantry, and 500 cavalry. From there, he marched on Uscana. Livy had previously said that this city belonged to Perseus and the Romans failed to seize it. However, in his discussion of the war's third year, it has apparently switched allegiance to Rome without further comment. Perseus sent envoys to the officers of the mixed Roman and Illyrian garrison, but they refused to surrender and he laid in a siege. The defending commanders soon capitulated, and asked to be allowed to leave with their weapons. Perseus agreed, but then disarmed them. He moved the population of the city to Stubera and sold them as slaves. The 4,000 enemy troops were sent to various towns. He then marched on Draudacum, whose garrison surrendered, and then took eleven forts, taking 1,500 Romans. He seized Oaeneus, killed the men and put the women and children in custody. He sent envoys to Gentius, to urge him for an alliance. Gentius said he did not have enough money for war. Perseus, who had a reputation for being a miser, sent the envoys back but did not mention money, even though he had the proceeds from the sale of slaves. Perseus ravaged Ancrya, went back to Uscana, fortifying it, and then returned to Macedon.Livy, The History of Rome, 43.18-20 Lucius Coelius, a commander in Illyria, remained inactive while Perseus was there. After Perseus returned to Macedon, Coelius tried to recover Uscana, but was repulsed and went back to Lychnidus. He sent a detachment to the area to receive the hostages from the cities which had remained loyal (they were sent to Apollonia) and from the Parthini (a tribe of southern Illyria), who were sent to Dyrrhachium (modern Durr√´s, Albania). Perseus was invited by the Epirots to attack Aetolia and marched on Stratus, the strongest Aetolian city, with 10,000 infantry and 300 cavalry. He could not pitch camp on the snow-covered Mount Citium and had to encamp elsewhere. He then was held up at the River Aracthus because of its deep water. He built a bridge, crossed, and then met Archidamus, a distinguished Aetolian, who had persuaded the nobles to betray Stratus. However, while he was away, the pro-Roman faction called in a Roman garrison. Dinarchus, the commander of the Aetolian cavalry, also arrived with 600 infantry and 100 cavalry to support Perseus, but when he saw the changed situation he switched allegiance to Rome. Due to the winter weather, Perseus abandoned Stratus, and went to Aperantia, which, through the influence of Archidamus, willingly surrendered. Archidamus was made its governor, while Perseus returned to Macedon. LLivy, The History of Rome, 43.21-22 Appius Claudius was eager make up for his defeat in Illyria and attacked a stronghold in Epirus. He had force of 6,000 men, Romans and contingents of Thesprotians and from Chaon (both from Epirus). He was repulsed by a strong garrison Perseus had left there. He besieged the city, but then lifted the siege due to a report that Perseus was marching there. He was pursued up an almost impassable mountain and lost 1,000 men, in addition to 200 captured. He then encamped on the plain. The pursuers were joined by an Epirot force, which ravaged the area; 1,000 troops of the city of Antigonea were killed and 100 of them were captured in an ambush. They then encamped near Appius Claudius, who decided to go back to Illyria. He sent the soldiers to winter camps and returned to Rome.Livy, The History of Rome 43.21.4, 23 =Spring Campaign= In early spring the consul, Quintus Marcius, sailed with 5,000 men to reinforce his legions, disembarked at Ambracia and moved towards Thessaly. Figulus took his fleet into the Gulf of Corinth, left his ships at Creusa, and went to join the fleet stationed at Chalcis overland. Aulus Hostilius, who had been protecting Rome's allies, had restored discipline in his troops and was encamped in Thessaly; he handed over his troops and returned to Rome. The consul started marching towards Macedon. Perseus sent troops to the mountain passes into Macedon.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.1.1-7, 2, 3 Quintus Marcius carried out a heroic march into Macedon through the tough mountains of the Olympus range. He sent 4,000 light infantry ahead to secure the road to a pass near Octolophus, but the road was so difficult and steep that they advanced only fifteen miles and seven miles the next day. They spotted an enemy camp guarding the pass. Quintus Marcius stopped on a hill, which gave a wide view and ordered one day's rest. The next day he attacked with half of his troops. The enemy had seen the Roman camp and was ready. The narrow ridge allowed only for the deployment of small numbers of light troops and so the engagement was limited to a skirmish between light troops. Perseus, who was not far, did not intervene or send more troops. Despite the presence of the enemy, Quintus Marcius had no choice but to persist. Leaving some troops to guard the summit, he marched across through trackless places, having sent forward a party to open a road, with allied troops protecting them while clearing the way through the forests. Marcius kept the cavalry and baggage before him and closed the rear with the legions. The descent from the hill was tough; the pack animals often fell. In impassable steeps the elephants threw off their riders and roared loudly, frightening the horses. A series of bridges (made with two long posts fastened to the earth to which ten-yard-long beams were attached) was made where the rocks were steep, in order to help the elephants. The Romans advanced only seven miles, and then waited for the troops at the camp to join them. On the fourth day they reached a pass and encountered similarly difficult terrain. As they got close to the plain some troops encamped between Heracleum and Libethrus, while some occupied a valley and part of the plain. The greater part was on hillsides.Livy, The History of Rome, 44-4.5 Perseus panicked. He evacuated the area and all the strong posts, leaving them open to the Romans, even though the area was easily defensible. He ordered the inhabitants of Dium, where he was encamped, to move to Pydna and also moved his statues there. Quintus Marcius advanced, but he faced a difficult decision. The Romans could leave the area only through two passes: through the Vale of Tempe to Thessaly or on to Macedon by way of Dium, and both were guarded. The Romans could not withdraw to Thessaly lest they cut off their supply lines. Furthermore, the Vale of Tempe was a difficult passage, very dangerous even if it was not guarded. The precipices on both sides were very steep and there was a passage which was so narrow that there was barely room for a loaded horse. To make things worse, there were guard detachments in four places along the pass. One was at the entrance, another in a thick forest and the third on the road where the valley was narrowest (Livy did not specify the characteristics of the fourth). The only way to retreat or receive supplies was to cross the same mountains the Romans had come through, but they were also very difficult to pass. It was also hard to pass through unnoticed as the enemy was posted on the heights. The only option was the area between the bottom of Mount Olympus and the sea, but that was only a mile wide, half of which was the bog of the mouth of the River Baphirus and a large part of the remaining plain was taken up by the town. The small remaining space could be easily closed off by a short rampart with towers and the material for its construction was abundant.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.6 =The Campaign in Thessaly= Quintus Marcius ordered Spurius Lucretius, who was in Larissa (Thessaly), to capture the deserted forts around Vale of Tempe. He sent scouts to check the roads around Dium and then he marched to the city. It was so rich and well-fortified that Quintus Marcius could not believe his luck that it had been evacuated. He continued his march, forcing the surrender of Agasse. To get a good reputation he did not garrison it and did not ask for taxes. He moved on to the river Ascordus, but, as he got further away from the supplies from Thessaly, plunder became scant and provisions were scarce, so he returned to Dium. The Roman fleet arrived, but he was told that the transport ships were in Magnesia, further south. Luckily, he was informed by Lucretius that the forts he had taken had plenty of corn. Quintus Marcius moved his headquarters to Phila to distribute corn to the soldiers on the spot. Livy noted that some people alleged that he had withdrawn because of fear that if he had stayed he would have had to risk a battle, while others said that he let his gains slip. With his withdrawal Perseus marched back to Dium, rebuilt the fortifications the Romans had pulled down, and encamped on bank of the Enipeus to use this difficult-to-cross river as a defence. Meanwhile, Quintus Marcius sent 2,000 men, from Phila to seize Heracleum, halfway between Dium and the Vale of Tempe, and moved his quarters there, as if he intended to besiege Dium. Instead, he prepared for the winter and had roads built for the transport of supplies from Thessaly.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.7, 8 In the meantime, Figulus sailed from Heracleum to Thessalonica. He pillaged the countryside and repulsed sorties from the towns, employing naval catapults. After this, the troops were re-embarked, and he made for Aenia, fifteen miles away, and pillaged its fertile countryside. He then sailed to Antigonea and did the same, but a Macedonian detachment intercepted the troops and killed 500 men. There was another fight by the coast and, assisted by men from the ships, the Romans killed 200 enemies. The fleet sailed on to the district of Pallene (the Chalkidiki peninsula), whose territory by far the most plentiful. There, Figulus was joined by 20 ships from Eumenes II of Pergamon and five ships from Prusias I of Bithynia. This encouraged him to besiege Cassandrea, which connected the Pallene peninsula (one of the three long peninsulas which extend from the Chalkidiki peninsula) with the rest of the land. An attack was repulsed by the city garrison. The arrival of a Macedonian ship from Thessalonica with Gallic auxiliaries led to the lifting of the siege. The Romans and Eumenes considered besieging Torone, but changed their minds because it had a strong garrison. They went on to Demetrias, but they saw that the walls were fully manned. Thus, they brought the fleet into harbour at Iolcos, pillaging the countryside there first.Livy, The History of Rome,10.5-12, 11, 12 So as not to remain inactive, Quintus Marcius sent 5,000 men, to Meliboea by Mount Ossa, where it stretches out into Thessaly in a strategic position to command Demetrias. Works for a siege started. Perseus heard about this attack and sent one of his commanders with 2,000 men. His instructions were that if he could not dislodge the Romans at Meliboea he was to march on Demetrias before Figulus and Eumenes moved there from Iolcos. When the Romans at Meliboea saw him arriving they burnt the siege works and left. The Macedonians hurried to Demetrias. Figulus and Eumenes reached the walls of the city. It was rumoured that there were negotiations between Eumenes and Antimachus, the governor of the city and a Cretan, Cydas. Whatever the case, the Romans left. Eumenes sailed to visit the consul and then returned to Pergamon. Figulus sent part of the fleet to winter at Sciatus and went to Oreum in Euboea with the rest of the fleet because it was a better base from which to send supplies to Macedon and Thessaly. Livy noted different accounts about Eumenes. According to one he did not give assistance to Figulus, even though he had asked for it and that when he left for Pergamon he was not on good terms with the consul. Quintus Marcius could not get him to leave his Gallic cavalry behind.Livy, The history of Rome, 44.13 Ambassadors from Bithynia and from Rhodes went to Rome to propose peace. The Bithynians said that their king had promised Perseus to mediate for peace and asked the senate to give him this role. The Rhodians said that during the interwar period they had started a friendship with Perseus which they broke unwillingly because Rome wanted to draw them into an alliance. Now the war disrupted their trade, brought losses in port duties and in provisions and caused scarcity on the island. They said that they wanted peace and that they had also sent envoys to Perseus to broker it. They would consider what measures to take against either party who insisted on carrying on the war. This message was considered arrogant. Livy noted that one source wrote that it was ignored while others wrote that the senate replied that the Rhodians and Perseus had conspired against Rome and that the words of the ambassadors confirmed this. Once Perseus had been defeated, Rome would consider how to make due retribution.Livy the History of Rome, 14.5-13, 15 The fourth year of the war (168 BC). The consuls for 168 BC were Lucius Aemilius Paulus (for the second time) and Gaius Licinius Crassus. Macedon was assigned to Lucius Aemilius and the command of the fleet was assigned to the praetor Gnaeus Octavius. The praetor Lucius Anicius was put in charge of Illyria.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.17.3, 10 =Preparations for the campaign= Aemilius was very careful in the preparation of his campaign. He asked for a commission to find out if the troops were still on the mountains or had gone to the plain, to inspect the armies and the fleet, to report on what was required, whether the allies were still loyal, which states were hostile, the status of Perseus‚Äô troops and the logistics for supplies. They reported that the Romans had advanced towards Macedon, but the travel on the pathless mountains had resulted in more peril than profit. Perseus was still holding his country and the two forces were very close to each other. The Romans had corn rations for only six days. The Roman position in Illyria was perilous and needed to be either reinforced or withdrawn. A strong enough army there could open a second front. Some of the fleet's crew had died of disease and some had gone home, leaving the ships undermanned; also, the men did not have proper clothing and had not received their pay.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.18, 20.2-7 The senate decided that two new legions of 5,000 infantry each were to be taken to Macedon. The men in Macedon who were unfit for service were to be discharged, the two legions there were to have 6,000 infantry each and the rest of the men were to be sent to the various garrisons. The forces of the Italian allies were to be 10,000 infantry and 800 cavalry. For the fleet 5,000 sailors were to be levied.Livy, The History of Rome, 44. 21 =Perseus misses opportunities= A year earlier Gentius, the king of the Illyrians, was invited to join Macedon in an alliance. He had told Perseus that he did not have money for a war. Perseus could not make up his mind about giving him money. When he felt pressured by the Romans, who had crossed the mountain passes towards Macedon, he decided to offer Gentius 300 silver talents if hostages were exchanged. Perseus sent an envoy to Gentius who gave him his sworn sword and the hostages. Gentius sent an envoy of his to Perseus to get his sworn sword, the hostages and the money, which was to be collected by men who accompanied him. After receiving all of these he was to travel to the island of Rhodes with Macedonian envoys to deliver a plea by the two kings for Rhodes and her powerful navy to join them against the Romans. Perseus went to meet the Illyrians, the hostages were exchanged and the treaty concluded. The men who were to receive the money were sent to the royal treasury in Pella, the capital. The Illyrian and Macedonian ambassadors were ordered to board a ship at Thessalonica, where they were joined by a Rhodian who stated that the Rhodians were ready for war; he was made head of the joint delegation. Perseus let the Illyrians in Pella seal the 300 promised talents and had 10 talents sent to Gentius. However, he got his men to carry the money and told them to proceed slowly and to wait for his instructions when they reached the border. Gentius, who had received only a small part of the money, was constantly urged to provoke the Romans into an attack. As a result, he imprisoned two Roman envoys. Perseus, believing that Gentius had now been pushed into war with Rome, told the couriers to take the money back to his treasury. Livy wrote that, through his avarice, Perseus had lost an alliance with Gentius backed by large army of Gauls (see below).Livy, The History of Rome, 44.23, 26.2, 27.1-12 When the Macedonian and Illyrian envoys reached Rhodes, the Rhodians thought that Perseus and Gentius were still allies and that the Gauls had been hired. This strengthened the leaders of the pro-Macedonian faction who declared that Rhodes had sufficient authority to put an end to the war and that the kings had to accede to peace.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.29.6-8 Perseus also sent a common message to Eumenes II of Pergamon and Antiochus IV, the Seleucid king, which invited them to put pressure on the Romans for peace talks. The message to Antiochus was sent openly. The one to Eumenes was sent under the pretence of ransoming prisoners and some secret deals between the two of them occurred which caused suspicions in Rome and accusations that Eumenes II was a traitor. This was also related to a Cretan, Cydas, who was a close friend of Eumenes. He went to meet a countryman who served in the army of Perseus at Amphipolis, in Macedon, and then had conversations with two officers of Perseus under the walls of Demetrias. He had previously gone to Eumenes as an envoy twice. The fact that these secretive missions had taken place was notorious, but the precise nature of the dealings between the two kings was not known.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.24 Perseus also approached Eumenes II of Pergamon directly, even though he was an enemy of Macedon. Eumenes knew that Perseus pursued peace. He also thought that as the war dragged on the Romans would be interested in bringing it to an end. He wanted to win their good graces by helping them to secure what he thought would come about of itself. He asked a price on 1,000 talents for not helping the Romans by land or sea and 15,000 talents for mediating peace. Perseus agreed to send his hostages to Crete. He said that he would pay the money only when the deal was complete and that meanwhile he would send it to Samothrace, an island which belonged to him. Eumenes agreed, but asked for part of the sum immediately. He struggled to obtain it. Livy commented that ‚Äúhaving manoeuvred with each other to no purpose, they gained nothing but disgrace‚Äù, and that, but for a small amount of money, Perseus missed a chance for successful peace talks or, had they failed, the ignition of hostilities between Rome and Eumenes.Livy, The History of Rome 44.25, 26.1 Through avarice Perseus also lost a chance to hire Gallic mercenaries. A body on infantry and cavalry of Gauls who lived in the Balkans offered its services to Perseus for money. Perseus went to one of his camps with a small amount of gold to give to a few of the men hoping that this would entice the others. He got an envoy to tell the Gauls to move their camp to a place near Macedon. The Gauls asked whether the gold had been brought. There was no reply and they said that they would not move unless they received the gold. Perseus gave his officers the excuse that the Gauls were savages and that he would hire only 5,000 cavalry, which were enough for war and not too many to be dangerous, in order to justify not wanting to spend money on the whole of the Gallic body. When the Gauls heard that only 5,000 cavalry and no infantry were going to be hired, the rest of their army was disgruntled. The Gallic chieftain asked whether the 5,000 men would receive the agreed pay, but received an evasive answer. The Gauls left, devastating part of Thrace as they went. Livy thought that this large force of effective fighters could have been used effectively in combined operations with the forces of Perseus, which could have put the Romans in an untenable position.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.26, 27.1-6 =War in Illyria= Gentius assembled the whole of his forces, 15,000 men, at Lissus and sent his brother Caravantius with 1,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to subdue the Cavii while he advanced on Bassania, five miles away, which was an ally of Rome. The city chose to endure a siege. One town of the Cavii, Durnium, opened its gates. Another, Caravandis, closed them and Caravantius ravaged the fields. The peasants killed many of the scattered plunderers. Appius Claudius had strengthened his army with some units of Bulinian, Apollonian, and Dyrrhachian contingents and left his winter quarters. He was encamped near the river Genusus. The praetor Lucius Anicius had arrived in Apollonia and sent a letter to Appius, asking him to wait for him. Three days after, he arrived at the camp with 2,000 infantry and 200 Parthinian cavalry. He prepared to march into Illyria to relieve Bassania. However, he was delayed by a report that the coast was being ravaged by 80 enemy boats. Here a passage of Livy is missing, but it can be deduced that he defeated this fleet (presumably, the Roman fleet was nearby), that he moved on to Bassania and that Gentius fled to Scodra, the capital. This was the most strongly fortified city in the area and was protected by two rivers and the whole of the Illyrian army. Despite this, Lucius Anicius prepared for battle by the city walls. Instead of manning the walls, which would have given them an advantage, the Illyrians marched out and gave battle. They were pushed back and more than 200 men crowded by the gate fell. The Illyrians asked for a truce and were given three days. Gentius then surrendered. A few days later he was sent to Rome.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.30.5-15,31 =The campaign of Lucius Aemilius= Perseus sent 200 cavalry to guard the sea and ordered 200 targeteers in Thessalonica to encamp close to the naval arsenal. He sent 5,000 troops to garrison the mountains of Pythium and Petra, which were close to Thessaly, to guard against a Roman advance. He fortified the banks of the River Elpeus because it was dried and thus easy to pass. The women of the nearby cities were ordered to bring provisions. Aemilius was encamped near this river. The envoys from Rhodes arrived at the Roman camp to advocate for peace, but they encountered hostility. Aemilius told them that he would give them an answer in two weeks and went on to discuss battle plans with his war council. He ruled out trying to force a crossing of the river or to get Octavius to devastate the coast near Thessalonica, as he considered the fortifications of the river insurmountable. He heard from two local traders that Perrhaebia (where the Pythian mountain range was) was poorly guarded. He thought that an attack at night could dislodge the enemy detachments there. He sent for Octavius and told him to sail to Heracelum and store ten days‚Äô rations for 1,000 men. He sent Publius Scipio Nasica Corculum there with 5,000 soldiers. He told Nasica privately that this was a pretence: Nasica would board the fleet, as if to raid the coast, but, in fact, he would then disembark and march to the mountains‚Äîthe rations were for enabling the troops to march faster, without having to forage. Aemilius scheduled the march so that Nasica would reach the Pythian mountains three days later. Livy said that Nasica had 5,000 troops. However, Plutarch noted that Nasica wrote in a letter that he had 5,000 Roman and 3,000 Italian infantry, 120 cavalry and 200 mixed Thracians and Cretans.This suggests that some of these people, most of whom fought for Perseus, also fought for the Romans When he reached Heracleum, Nasica told his officers the real design and moved inland to Pythium. According to Plutarch, he stopped below Pythium whereas Livy wrote that he reached the summit. Plutarch described this force as an enveloping force. Livy wrote that Aemilius sent his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, with Nasica. Plutarch specified that the son volunteered to join the expedition.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.35.1-8.Plutarch, Parallel lives, The Life of Aemilius 15.2-9 Plutarch wrote that Perseus did not realise what was going on because Aemilius remained in his position quietly, whereas Livy did not state this about Perseus and gave an account of Aemilius giving two battles to keep Perseus distracted from the covert operation. Both authors wrote that a Cretan deserter informed Perseus, who sent 2,000 Macedonians and 10,000 mercenaries to Pythium. In Plutarch's account they went to occupy the mountain passes. Livy's account implies that they were sent to the pass Nasica was to attack. He also wrote that the pass was guarded by 5,000 Macedonian troops. He added that Nasica said that the steep descent would have been so unguarded that it would have been taken without trouble had it not been for the deserter. Both authors noted that Polybius (in a lost part of book 29 of his Histories) stated that Nasica attacked when they were asleep but Nasica wrote (in the mentioned letter) that there was a tough fight, that he killed a Thracian mercenary who had engaged him and that their leader disgracefully threw away his armour and cloak and fled. The Romans pursued the enemy down to the plain.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.35.15-17Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Aemilius, 16.1-3 Livy gave an account of battles fought by the River Elpius. Aemilius offered battle in the morning of the day after Nasica's departure. The ground of the river bed was over a mile wide and uneven, which hindered the heavy infantry. The Macedonians hurled javelins and rocks from their rampart and the turrets. Aemilius withdrew at noon. He engaged in battle again the next morning and withdrew later than the day before. On the third morning, he went to the lowest part of the camp, ‚Äúas if intending to attempt a passage through an entrenchment which stretched down to the sea ‚Ä¶‚Äù The rest of this passage is lost.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.35.9-13 After the defeat at the Pythian mountains, Perseus was unsure as what had to be done. He withdrew to Pydna, pitching camp in the plain, between the rivers Aeson and Leucus, which had been made shallow by the heat of the summer, but still deep enough to trouble the Romans. The even ground was favourable for the phalanx. There were hills to which the light infantry could withdraw after harassing the enemy to attack again.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.35.17-22Plutarch Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 16.4-9 Nasica re-joined his commander and Aemilius marched on Pydna, where he lined up the men in battle formation. However, at noon he ordered them to mark the line of a camp and deposit the baggage because it was hot, the men were tired from the march and they were greatly outnumbered by the enemy. Realising that there was not to be a battle, the soldiers were relieved. Some of the officers were unhappy, but they kept quiet. Nasica advised Aemilius to fight. He replied that he had learnt when it was ‚Äúproper to fight, and when to abstain from fighting.‚Äù He had lined up the men to keep the construction of the camp rampart behind them hidden from the enemy. He then withdrew them behind the rampart in stages starting from the rear. Aemilius placed the camp on uneven ground, which made the Macedonian phalanx quite useless. A veteran officer announced that there was going to be an eclipse that night, and reassured the soldiers who were ignorant about this phenomenon and would have seen it as a portent.Livy The History of Rome, 44.35-22, 36, 37-9Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Aemilius, 17.1-6 Aemilius performed sacrifices when the moon arose and through most of the next day. Plutarch wrote that this was because, although he was familiar with the phenomenon of the eclipse, he was very devout and he did so for divination, not for expiation. During the eclipse, he sacrificed eleven heifers to the goddess moon. During the day he sacrificed twenty oxen to Hercules without getting favourable omens. With the twenty-first the signs indicated victory if the Romans kept on the defensive. Livy wrote that the officers thought that Aemilius, who had hoisted the battle signal at dawn, was wasting time with these sacrifices.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.37-12-13Plutarch Parallel lives, The life of Aemilius, 17.9-12 When he finished, Aemilius convened a war council and explained why he was deferring the battle.Livy, The history of Rome, 44.37.13, 39-40 =The Battle of Pydna= The Battle of Pydna resolved the war decisively in favour of the Romans. Plutarch noted two versions of the beginning of the battle. According to some sources it began through a scheme devised by Aemilius to goad the enemy into attacking first; the Romans made a horse without a bridle run to the enemy's bank and sent some men to pursue it to provoke the enemy into an attack. Other sources said that Thracian troops came upon Roman pack animals which were bringing in forage; 700 Ligurian soldiers sallied against them and both parties sent reinforcements, starting a general fight. Aemilius went to the front line with Roman legionaries to encourage his troops. Livy also noted the horse version and added that it held that this was because the omens of Aemilius‚Äô last sacrifices said that the Romans would win only if they did not strike the first blow. However, Livy favoured another version and thought that the battle was brought on by happenstance. Both enemies collected water from a river closer to the Macedonian camp with the protection of detachments. The Roman side was protected by Italian allies: two cohorts of Marrucini and Paeligni and two squadrons of Samite cavalry. More troops (of Vestini and men from Firmum and Cremera) and two cavalry squadrons (of men from Placentia and Aesernia) were stationed in front of the camp. While both sides were quiet, a mule broke loose and escaped towards the enemy's bank. Three Italians went into the river to pursue the animal. Two Thracian soldiers dragged it out of the water and towards their bank. The Italians pursued them, retook the mule, killing one of Thracians, and went back to their post. Some of the 800 Thracians chased the Italians and soon, the rest engaged with the enemy guards. Then units from both sides joined in and the king and the consul mobilised their forces. Livy wrote that whether by the design of Aemilius or by accident, this is what sparked the battle.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Aemilius,18.1-3Livy, The Roman History, 44.40.1-2 When it seemed that he could not stop the fighting, Aemilius decided to turn an accident into an opportunity and brought his forces out of the camp. Nasica told him that Perseus was advancing. The Thracians, flanked by light infantry, formed the first line. Next to them there were mercenaries of various nationalities. The Leucaspides (phalanx with white shields) formed the middle. In the rear there were the Chalcaspides (phalanx with bronze shields), flanked on the right wing by another phalanx. These two were the main strength of the army. There were also targeteers, who were midway between the phalanx and the light infantry. They had spikes like those of the phalanx but wore light armour. They stood in front of the wings. This army had been so swift that those who were first killed fell close to the Roman camp. A unit of Paelignans from central Italy and those at their rear were routed and the rest of the soldiers in that part of the battlefield withdrew to a hill. Elsewhere the Roman forces were hesitant to confront the long spears of the Macedonian phalanx. When the Romans tried to push aside their stretched out spears, the Macedonians held them firmly and transfixed the enemy, piercing both their shields and armour. The spears formed an insurmountable barrier.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.40.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 20.1-6 The strength of the Macedonian phalanx relied on keeping its lines compact by interlocking their shields. Aemilius noticed that the phalanx was not compact everywhere and that in some places there were gaps. These were due to the length of its lines, the unevenness of the ground (which caused those on higher ground to become separated from those on the lower ground) and differences between those who were faster and those who were slower or those who were slowed down because they were pressed by the enemy. Aemilius ordered his cohorts to attack any gaps, however narrow, and slip through like a wedge to break up the ranks of the phalanx and divide the battle into many separate fights. The wedged-in troops attacked the flank of the phalanx where it was not protected by the spears and the sides of the soldiers was not shielded by their breastplates. They also cut off the lines they attacked by falling on their rear. The efficiency of the phalanx was lost. Forced to engage in man-to-man fights or fights between small detachments, the Macedonians had to turn their spears, which were unwieldy because of their length and weight. They became tangled with each other and useless. Their small daggers could not hack the enemy shields or oppose their swords. They were not a firm body anymore and could quite easily be thrown into disarray Livy, The History of Rome, 44.40-7-10 41 6-7 Plutarch, Parallel lives, The Life of Aemilius, 20.7-10 The legion of Aemilius wedged in between the phalanxes and targeteers and had the targeteers behind and the Chalcaspides in front. Lucius Albinus, a former consul, was sent against the Leucaspides of the centre of the enemy lines. The elephants and the allied cavalry were sent to the right wing, by the river, where the battle began. This was also the area where the Macedonians started to retreat. This attack was followed by an attack on the left wing by the Latin allies, who pushed it back. The second legion charged the centre, broke the lines of the enemy and dispersed it.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.41.1-5 Plutarch wrote that Marcus, the son of Cato the Elder and the son-in‚Äëlaw of Aemilius, lost his sword. He rallied his companions to his aid, who put themselves under his leadership, and attacked. They filled gaps which were hidden by hips of fallen bodies. They fought 3,000 select elite Macedonians who remained in close ranks and slaughtered them. The battle ended at four o‚Äô clock and was won in one hour. The rest of the day was spent pursuing fugitives over a stretch of three miles. Plutarch wrote that the Macedonians lost 25,000 men and noted that according to Poseidonius (see below) the Romans lost 100 men while according to Nasica they lost eighty.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 21, 22.1--2 Livy wrote the Macedonians suffered the greatest losses in any battle with the Romans and that if the battle had started earlier, the Romans would have had more daylight time to pursue the Macedonians and all their troops would have been destroyed. The Macedonian wings fled in full ranks. The survivors of the hemmed-in phalanx fled unarmed to the sea. Some went into the water begging the Roman ships to save them. They walked further into the sea or swam towards the boats from the ships, but they were killed. Some headed back to the shore, but they were trampled over by the elephants which were being taken to the shore by their riders. The enemy lost 20,000 men, the captives were 6,000 of the men who fled the battle scene and 5,000 of those who scattered in the countryside. The victors lost no more than 100 men, most of whom were Paelignians.Livy, The history of Rome, 44.42.4-9 Plutarch also noted that Polybius wrote that Perseus cravenly left the battle immediately and went to the city under the pretext of offering sacrifices to Heracles, a god who did not accept sacrifices from cowards. The god, instead, listened to the prayers of the brave Aemilius who invited him to fight with him. Plutarch also noted that a man called Poseidonius, who wrote a history of Perseus and said that he participated in the battle, wrote that the king did not leave because cowardice or under the pretence of sacrifices, but because, the day before the battle, he was kicked in the leg by a horse. On the day of the battle, against advice to the contrary, he ordered a pack horse and joined the phalanx without a breastplate. A dart tore his tunic on his left side and bruised his skin.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 19.4-10 Livy, instead, wrote that Perseus was the first to flee the battle with his sacred cavalry squadron. He fled to Pella and was quickly followed by the Thracian cavalry. The Roman forces, which were busy routing the Macedonian phalanx, were ‚Äúcareless of pursuing the cavalry.‚Äù ivy. The History of Rome, 44.42.2-3 =The pursuit of the fugitive Perseus= Livy wrote that Perseus fled to Pella, the capital, through the Pierian wood with his cavalry, which had survived the battle almost intact, and the royal retinue. In the darkness he left the main path with a few trusted men. The abandoned cavalrymen went back to their respective homes. Plutarch, instead, wrote that he came across some infantrymen who called the horsemen cowards and traitors and tried to push them off their horses. He turned away from the road, drew his purple cloak and held it in front of him to be inconspicuous. He also carried the royal diadem in his hand. He dismounted to converse with his companions and walked with them. These found excuses to fall behind and ran away because they were afraid of his cruelty. Perseus reached Pella and in Livy he was met at the palace by the governor of Pella and the royal pages. In Plutarch he was met by his treasurers whom he killed because of bold remarks about the defeat. Perseus‚Äô friends, who also had escaped to Pella independently, shunned him. Only Euander the Cretan, Archedamus the Aetolian, and Neon the Boeotian remained. Fearing a plot, Perseus continued his escape with an escort of about five hundred Cretans. They did so only because they were given money. He rushed to cross the river Axius before daylight, because he thought that the Romans would not pursue him beyond this river, which was difficult to cross. He reached Amphipolis three days after the battle. He sent ambassadors to the Romans. In the meantime, Hippias Milo, and Pantauchus, three of his main friends, had fled to Ber≈ìa and surrendered that city and several others. Perseus addressed the people of Amphipolis, but he was met with hostility because of fears that his presence would lead to a Roman attack. He left the city and arrived at Galespus the next day.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.43, 44, 45.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 23 In the meantime, Aemilius sent three envoys to Rome to announce the victory. He moved nearer the sea, towards Pydna. Most Macedonian cities surrendered. Pydna had not yet sent any ambassadors because many military men of different nationalities had fled there and walled the city gates. Milo and Pantauchus were sent to address the situation. The soldiers were sent away and the city was given up for the Roman soldiers to plunder.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.45,3, 5-7 Plutarch, who was quite scathing of Perseus, wrote that at Galepsus his fear abated and he reverted to his avarice. He claimed that the Cretans had stolen some of the gold plate of Alexander and implored them to exchange it for money. He was playing Cretan against Cretan and those who gave it back to him were cheated. He paid less money than he promised and got the money from his friends. He then sailed to the island of Samothrace where he took refuge as a suppliant in the temple of the Dioscuri, which was a sanctuary.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 23.9-10 Perseus‚Äô ambassadors reached Aemilius who, thinking that he was in Amphipolis, sent Nasica there with a detachment to obstruct the king. Meanwhile, Gnaeus Octavius, the Roman naval commander, sacked Melib≈ìa. At Aeginium, which was not aware that the war had ended, the inhabitant made a sortie against Gnaeus Anicius, who had been sent there, and two hundred men were lost. Aemilius left Pydna for Pella. On receiving intelligence that Perseus had gone to Samothrace, he moved on to Amphipolis and then crossed the river Strymon and went to Sirae, where he encamped.Livy, The History of Rome, 44.46 Three ambassadors gave Aemilius a letter from Perseus which contained appeals for mercy which in Livy's opinion \\"were anything but kingly.\\" Aemilus did not reply and Perseus sent another letter in which \\"he begged most urgently\\" for envoys to be sent to him to confer on the state of his affairs. Aemilius sent three men, but nothing came out of the meeting; \\"Perseus clung desperately to his royal title, and [Aemilius] was determined that he should place himself and all that he possessed at the mercy of Rome.\\" Meanwhile, Gnaeus Octavius, the commander of the Roman fleet anchored it off Samothrace and, out of respect to the gods and the sanctuary on the island, did not go for Perseus, but took measures to prevent him from escaping by sea and tried to pressure him to surrender.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.4-5.1Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 26.1 Lucius Atilius, \\"a young man of distinction,\\" was allowed to attend an assembly of the people of the island. He accused Euander, the leader of the Cretan mercenaries, of having attempted to murder king Eumenes II of Pergamon at the sanctuary of Delphi, and called for him to be put on trial. Violence was forbidden at these sacred places. The people of Samothrace, which was also a sanctuary, agreed. If found guilty this would have exposed Perseus as the instigator of the attempted murder. Euander wanted to escape, but Perseus, fearing that the Samothracians would think that he had helped him to escape, had him killed. He then realised that he would be accused of murder in a sanctuary and bribed the leader of the island to say that Euander had committed suicide. However, this alienated the inhabitants, who went over to the Romans. Therefore, Perseus planned to escape. He hired the ship of a Cretan and had all the money he could take secretly transported to the ship at sunset. At midnight he climbed a wall and reached the shore. However, the ship had sailed off as soon as the money was on board. Perseus hid in the temple of Demetrius. Gaius Octavius proclaimed that if the royal pages and all the Macedonians on the island went over to the Romans they would be granted impunity and freedom. They all left Perseus except for his eldest son, Phillip. At this point Perseus surrendered.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.5-6 According to Plutarch, Perseus asked for Nasica, whom he trusted, but he was not there. Thus, he gave himself to Gnaeus Octavius.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 26.2-7 Perseus (together with Gentius) was sent to Rome as a prisoner. The motion to award Aemilius a triumph was disputed by an officer who had a personal gripe with him and sought support from the soldiers who felt they had been given less of the share of the booty from Perseus‚Äô immense wealth they should have had. Aemilius kept part of this for the treasury. However, the motion was carried and Aemilius celebrated his triumph. Perseus was led in chains in front of the procession and was then kept in custody at Alba Fucens for the rest of his life.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.35-1.6-7, 40, 42.3Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Aemilius, 32.4-9, 33, 34 Aftermath: the partition of Macedon Aemilius sent his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus, who had returned from Rome, to sack two cities: Agassae, which revolted after it had surrendered to the consul and asked for an alliance with Rome, and Aeginium, which refused to believe the Roman victory and killed some Roman soldiers who entered the town. Lucius Postumius was sent to sack Aeniae \\"because of its obstinacy\\".Livy, The History of Rome, 45.27.1-4 Commissioners were sent to Macedon and to Illyria. Livy wrote that the senate resolved that the Macedonians and Illyrians should be free \\"so that it might be clear to all the world that the arms of Rome did not carry slavery to the free, but on the contrary freedom to the enslaved; and also that amongst those nations which enjoyed liberty, the security and permanence of their liberty rested under the protection of Rome.\\" This had to do with the self-image the Romans liked to have and with propaganda, rather than reality. The contracts for working the rich mines of Macedon and the leases of the royal domains were scrapped and were put under Roman tax collectors. The pretext was that without them ‚Äúthe law lost its authority or the subjects their liberty‚Äù and that the Macedonians were unable to work the mines themselves because those in charge would line their pockets and this could cause unrest. Ironically, the Roman tax collectors became notorious for lining their pockets. The Macedonian national council was abolished with the excuse that this was intended to prevent a demagogue from flattering the ‚Äúmob‚Äù and turn the freedom granted by the Romans into a ‚Äúdangerous and fatal licence.‚Äù Macedon was to be divided into four republics, each with its own council which would have to pay Rome a tribute which was half of what used to be paid to the king. The same regulations applied to Illyria. More definite arrangements were to be made by the commissioners.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.18 When the commission arrived from Rome Aemilius gave notice for the representatives of all the cities to assemble at Amphipolis and bring all the documents they had and all the money due to the Royal treasury. A conference was held and there was such a display of pomp and power that Livy wrote that it ‚Äúmight have even appalled the allies of Rome.‚Äù It was declared that the Macedonians were to be free and retain their fields and cities and elect their officials. Then the partition, the borders of the four cantons and the tribute were announced. Aemilius designated the four capitals. Intermarriage between people of different cantons and the possession of houses or land in more than one canton were banned. The gold and silver mines were not allowed to be mined, but the iron and copper ones were. Importation of salt and cutting of wood for domestic shipbuilding or allowing others to do so were forbidden. The cantons bordering other nations were allowed to have border troops.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.29, 30 The Romans also used their victory to increase their control over the whole of Greece by supporting the pro-Roman factions around Greece. Their supporters had come to the conference from all over Greece. They made allegations that many of those who had supported Perseus in their cities and states had fostered hostility towards Rome, claimed that maintaining loyalty to Rome in their states required crushing them, and gave lists of names. The commissioners decided that the people on the list had to go to Rome to make their defence. Livy wrote that the pro-Romans were inflated ‚Äúto an insupportable pitch of insolence.‚Äù In Macedon everyone who had been in the king's service was sent to Italy with their children over fifteen.Livy, The History of Rome, 45. 31, 32.1-6 Aemilius sent Nasica and his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus, to ravage the areas of Illyria which had helped Perseus.Livy, The history of Rome, 45.33.8  The enslavement of 150,000 Epirots  After the defeat of the Illyrian king, Lucius Anicius, the commander in Illyria, placed garrisons in the Illyrian cities. Then he marched on Epirus with the rest of his army to suppress the rebellion there. All the cities, except for four (Passaron, Tecmon, Phylace and Horreum), surrendered. Passaron was the first of these cities which was attacked. Its two leaders were the men who had incited Epirus to side with Perseus and told the inhabitants that death was preferable to servitude. A young noble stood against them and encouraged the people to drive the two men out of the city, which then surrendered. At Tecmon the city leader was killed and this city surrendered as well. The other two cities fell after a siege. When Epirus was pacified and detachments were sent to various cities for wintering, Lucius Anicius returned to Scodra, the capital of Illyria, where five commissioners had arrived from Rome. Here he summoned the leaders from all around Illyria to a conference. In agreement with the commissioners, he announced that the Roman garrisons were going to be withdrawn from all the cities so that the Illyrians could be free. Some of the cities had deserted Caravantius, the brother of Gentius, and gone over to the Romans. They were, therefore, exempted from paying a tribute. Other cities which had rebelled when Gentius was still in power were also granted this exemption. The three cities which had resisted the longest were to pay half of the tribute they paid to Gentius. Lucius Anicius also declared that Illyria was to be split into three cantons.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.26 Aemilius went to Epirus on his way back to Rome. The senate gave his army permission to plunder the cities in Epirus which had supported Perseus. Centurions were sent to tell all the cities that they had come to remove to the Roman garrisons because the Epirots were to be free. The leaders of each city were summoned and told to bring the silver and gold in their towns to a designated place and that Roman cohorts had been ordered to visit all the cities. Troops were sent to seventy cities. This was coordinated so that they would reach each city on the same day. The precious metals were collected in the morning and at 10 am and then the soldiers were ordered to sack the cities. The city walls were demolished. The booty was enormous and part of the proceeds from its sale was given to the men of the army, 400 denarii to the cavalrymen and 200 to the foot soldiers. In addition to this, 150,000 people were enslaved. The troops resented that they were not given a share of the booty from the royal palace of Perseus ‚Äúas though they had not taken any part in the Macedonian war.‚Äù Aemilius then sailed back to Italy with his army. A few days later Lucius Anicius, who had been meeting the representatives of the rest of the Epirots, told them that the senate wanted to hear the case of some of their leaders and ordered these men to follow him to Italy. He then waited for return of the ships which had been used to transport the army from Macedonia and returned to Italy.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.34.1-9Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Aemilius, 29 See also *Ancient Greek warfare *Military history of Greece *Agathagetus Quotes References Primary sources * Livy, History of Rome from Its Foundation: Rome and the Mediterranean (Books 42-45), Penguin Classics, Reprint edition, 1976; * Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The life of Aemilius, Loeb Classical Library, Vol 6, 1989; Secondary Sources * Grant, M., The History of Rome, Faber & Faber, 1986; Giles, J., The History of Ancient Greece, its Colonies and Conquests, To The Division of The Macedonian Empire, Bangs, Brother & Co.; 1st Ed(AsSuch) edition, 1852; ASIN: B001CYBX0Y * Matyszak, P., The Enemies of Rome: From Hannibal to Attila the Hun, Thames & Hudson, 2004; Further reading *Sherwin-White, Adrian N. 1984.

Anthriscus, after some early successes, was eventually defeated by the Roman general Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus at the Second Battle of Pydna in 148 BC, and the uprising subsequently collapsed. Two years later Macedonia became a Roman province. In response, the Achaean League in 146 BC mobilized for a new war against the Roman Empire. This is sometimes referred to as the Achaean War, and was noted for its short duration and its timing right after the fall of Macedonia. Until this time, Rome had only campaigned in Greece in order to fight Macedonian forces, allies or clients. Rome's military supremacy was well established, having defeated Macedonia and its vaunted Phalanx already on three occasions, and defeating superior numbers against the Seleucids in Asia.History of Rome ‚Äì The republic, Isaac Asimov.

Hellenistic stirrings and the idea of triumphing against superior odds motivated the league into this rash decision.

Richard Allestree or Allestry ( ) (1621/2 ‚Äì 28 January 1681) was an English Royalist churchman and provost of Eton College from 1665. Life The son of Robert Allestree, descended from an old Derbyshire family, he was born at Uppington in Shropshire. Although John Fell gave his birth date as March 1619, this conflicts with his college records. He was educated at Coventry and later at Christ Church, Oxford, under Richard Busby. He entered as a commoner in 1636, matriculating as a student on 17 February 1637 aged fifteen, and took the degree of B.A. in 1640 and that of M.A. in 1643. In 1642 he joined the king's army, under Sir John Byron. When the parliamentary forces arrived in Oxford, he hid the Christ Church valuables, and the soldiers found nothing in the treasury \\"except a single groat and a halter at the bottom of a large iron chest\\". Allestree escaped severe punishment only because the army hastily retreated from the town. He was present at the Battle of Edgehill in October 1642, after which, while hurrying to Oxford to prepare for the king's visit to Christ Church, he was captured by a troop of Lord Say's soldiers from Broughton House, Cambridge, and soon afterwards set free on the surrender of the place to the king's forces. In 1643 he was again on military service, performing \\"all duties of a common soldier\\" and \\"frequently holding his musket in one hand and his book in the other\\". At the close of the English Civil War, he returned to his studies, took holy orders, was made Censor and became a \\"noted tutor\\". He remained an ardent royalist. He voted for the university decree against the Covenant, and, refusing submission to the parliamentary visitors in 1648, he was expelled. He found a retreat as chaplain in the house of Francis Newport, later Viscount Newport, in whose service he travelled to France. On his return he joined two of his friends, John Dolben and John Fell, afterwards respectively Archbishop of York and Bishop of Oxford, and later joined the household of Sir Antony Cope of Hanwell, near Banbury. He was now frequently employed in carrying despatches between the future Charles II of England and royalist sympathisers. In May 1659 he brought a command from Charles in Brussels, directing Brian Duppa, the Bishop of Salisbury, to summon all bishops to consecrate clergymen to various sees \\"to secure a continuation of the order in the Church of England\\", then in danger of becoming extinct. While returning from one of these missions, in the winter before the Restoration, he was arrested at Dover and committed a prisoner at Lambeth Palace, then used as a jail for royalists, but was freed after a few weeks at the instance, among others, of Lord Shaftesbury. At the Restoration he became canon of Christ Church, D.D. and city lecturer at Oxford. In 1663 he was made chaplain to the king and Regius Professor of Divinity. He was an Arminian discussion partner of the Calvinist Thomas Barlow while at Oxford. In 1665 he was appointed provost of Eton College, and proved himself a capable administrator. He introduced order into the disorganised finances of the college and procured the confirmation of William Laud's decree which reserved five of the Eton fellowships for members of King's College. His additions to the college buildings were less successful: the Upper School constructed by him at his own expense, was falling into ruin almost in his lifetime, and was replaced by the present structure in 1689. Allestree was buried in the chapel at Eton College, where there is a Latin inscription to his memory. Works His writings are: *The Privileges of the University of Oxford in point of Visitation (1647)--a tract answered by Prynne in the University of Oxford's Plea Rejected *18 sermons whereof 15 preached before the king ... (1669) *40 sermons whereof 21 are now first published ... (2 vols., 1684) *sermons published separately including A Sermon on Acts xiii. 2, (1660) *A Paraphrase and Annotations upon all the Epistles of St Paul (joint author with Abraham Woodhead and Obadiah Walker, 1675, see edition of 1853 and preface by W Jacobson). In the Cases of Conscience by Thomas Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln (1692), Allestree's judgment on Mr Cottington's Case of Divorce is included. A share in the composition, if not the sole authorship, of the books published under the name of the author of The Whole Duty of Man has been attributed to Allestree (Nichols's Anecdotes, ii. 603), and the tendency of modern criticism is to regard him as the author. His lectures, with which he was dissatisfied, were not published. Allestree was a man of extensive learning, of moderate views and a fine preacher. He was generous and charitable, of \\"a solid and masculine kindness,\\" and of a temper hot, but completely under control. =Authorities= *Wood's Athenae Oxonienses (edited by Bliss), iii. 1269 *Wood's Fasti, i. 480, 514, ii. 57, 241, 370 *Richard Allestree, 40 sermons, with biographical preface by Dr John Fell (2 vols., 1684) *Sufferings of the Clergy, (1714) by John Walker *Architectural History of Eton and Cambridge, by R.

P wave depolarization is the start-point of the atrial stage of systole. The ventricular stage of systole begins at the R peak of the QRS wave complex; the T wave indicates the end of ventricular contraction, after which ventricular relaxation (ventricular diastole) begins. The systole () is the part of the cardiac cycle during which some chambers of the heart muscle contract after refilling with blood. The term \\"systole\\" originates from New Latin via Ancient Greek œÉœÖœÉœÑŒøŒªŒÆ (sustolƒì): from œÉœÖœÉœÑŒ≠ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ (sustellein, \\"to contract\\") via [œÉœçŒΩ (syn, \\"together\\") + œÉœÑŒ≠ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ (stellein, \\"send\\"). The use of systole, \\"to contract\\", is very similar to the use of the English term \\"to squeeze\\". The mammalian heart has four chambers: the left atrium above the left ventricle (lighter pink, see graphic), which two are connected through the mitral (or bicuspid) valve; and the right atrium above the right ventricle (lighter blue), connected through the tricuspid valve. The atria are the receiving blood chambers for the circulation of blood and the ventricles are the discharging chambers. When, in late ventricular diastole, the atrial chambers contract, they send blood down to the larger, lower ventricle chambers. When normal flow is completed, the ventricles are filled and the valves to the atria are closed. The ventricles now perform systole isovolumetrically, which is contraction while all valves are closed‚Äîending the first stage of systole. The second stage proceeds immediately, pumping oxygenated blood from the left ventricle through the aortic valve and aorta to all body systems, and simultaneously pumping oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle through the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery to the lungs. Thus, the pairs of chambers (upper atria and lower ventricles) contract in alternating sequence to each other. First, atrial contraction feeds blood into the ventricles, then ventricular contraction pumps blood out of the heart to the body systems, including the lungs for resupply of oxygen. Cardiac systole is the contraction of the cardiac muscle in response to an electrochemical stimulus to the heart's cells (cardiomyocytes). Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by the each ventricle in one minute. The ejection fraction (EF) is the volume of blood pumped divided by the total volume of blood in the left ventricle. Types of systole =Atrial systole= P wave of the ECG, the two atria begin contracting (systole), pulsing blood under pressure into the ventricles. Atrial systole occurs late in ventricular diastole and represents the contraction of myocardium of the left and right atria. The sharp decrease in ventricular pressure that occurs during ventricular diastole allows the atrioventricular valves (or mitral and tricuspid valves) to open and causes the contents of the atria to empty into the ventricles. The atrioventricular valves remain open while the aortic and pulmonary valves remain closed because the pressure gradient between the atrium and ventricle is preserved during late ventricular diastole. Atrial contraction confers a minor-fraction addition to ventricular filling, but becomes significant in left ventricular hypertrophy, or thickening of the heart wall, as the ventricle does not fully relax during its diastole. Loss of normal electrical conduction in the heart‚Äîas seen during atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and complete heart block‚Äîmay eliminate atrial systole completely. Contraction of the atria follows depolarization, represented by the P wave of the ECG. As both atrial chambers contract‚Äîfrom the superior region of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum‚Äîpressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular valves. At the start of atrial systole, during ventricular diastole, the ventricles are normally filled to about 70 ‚Äì 80 percent of capacity by inflow from the atria. Atrial contraction also referred to as the \\"atrial kick,\\" contributes the remaining 20‚Äì30 percent of ventricular filling. Atrial systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial muscle returns to diastole. The two ventricles are isolated electrically and histologically (tissue-wise) from the two atrial chambers by electrically impermeable collagen layers of connective tissue known as the cardiac skeleton. The cardiac skeleton is made of dense connective tissue which gives structure to the heart by forming the atrioventricular septum‚Äîwhich separates the atria from the ventricles‚Äîand the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves. Collagen extensions from the valve rings seal and limit electrical activity of the atria from influencing electrical pathways that cross the ventricles. These electrical pathways contain the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, and the Purkinje fibers. (Exceptions such as accessory pathways may occur in this firewall between atrial and ventricular electrical influence but are rare.) Cardiac rate control via pharmacology is common today; for example, the therapeutic use of digoxin, beta adrenoceptor antagonists, or calcium channel blockers are important historical interventions in this condition. Notably, individuals prone to hypercoagulability (abnormality of blood coagulation) are at decided risk of blood clotting, a very serious pathology requiring therapy for life with an anticoagulant if it cannot be corrected. Right and left atrial systoles The atrial chambers each contains one valve: the tricuspid valve in the right atrium opens into the right ventricle, and the mitral (or bicuspid) valve in the left atrium opens into the left ventricle. Both valves are pressed open during the late stages of ventricular diastole; see Wiggers diagram at the P/QRS phase (at right margin). Then the contractions of atrial systole cause the right ventricle to fill with oxygen-depleted blood through the tricuspid valve. When the right atrium is emptied‚Äîor prematurely closed‚Äîright atrial systole ends, and this stage signals the end of ventricular diastole and the beginning of ventricular systole (see Wiggers diagram). The time variable for the right systolic cycle is measured from (tricuspid) valve-open to valve-closed. The contractions of atrial systole fill the left ventricle with oxygen-enriched blood through the mitral valve; when the left atrium is emptied or closed, left atrial systole is ended and ventricular systole is about to begin. The time variable for the left systolic cycle is measured from (mitral) valve-open to valve-closed. Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation represents a common electrical malady in the heart that appears during the time interval of atrial systole (see figure at right margin). Theory suggests that an ectopic focus, usually situated within the pulmonary trunks, competes with the sinoatrial node for electrical control of the atrial chambers and thereby diminishes the performance of the atrial myocardium, or atrial heart muscle. The ordered, sinoatrial control of atrial electrical activity is disrupted, causing the loss of coordinated generation of pressure in the two atrial chambers. Atrial fibrillation represents an electrically-disordered but well perfused atrial mass working (in an uncoordinated fashion) with a (comparatively) electrically-healthy ventricular systole. The compromised load caused by atrial fibrillation detracts from the overall performance of the heart, but the ventricles continue to work as an effective pump. Given this pathology, the ejection fraction may deteriorate by ten to thirty percent. Uncorrected atrial fibrillation can lead to heart rates approaching 200 beats per minute (bpm). If this rate can be slowed to a normal range, say about 80 bpm, the resultant longer fill-time within the cardiac cycle restores or improves the pumping capability of the heart. The labored breathing, for example, of individuals with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, can often be returned to normal by (electrical or medical) cardioversion. =Ventricular systole and Wiggers diagram= A Wiggers diagram, showing various events during systole (here primarily displayed as ventricular systole, or ventricular contraction). The very short interval (about 0.03 second) of isovolumetric, or fixed-volume, contraction begins (see upper left) at the R peak of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram graph-line. \\\\+ Ejection phase begins immediately after isovolumetric contraction‚Äîventricular volume (red graph-line) begins to decrease as ventricular pressure (light blue graph-line) continues to increase; then pressure drops as it enters diastole. A Wiggers diagram of ventricular systole graphically depicts the sequence of contractions by the myocardium of the two ventricles. Ventricular systole induces self-contraction such that pressure in both left and right ventricles rises to a level above that in the two atrial chambers, thereby closing the tricuspid and mitral valves‚Äîwhich are prevented from inverting by the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles. Now ventricular pressure continues to rise in isovolumetric, or fixed-volume, contraction phase until maximal pressure (dP/dt = 0) occurs, causing the pulmonary and aortic valves to open in ejection phase. In ejection phase, blood flows from the two ventricles down its pressure gradient‚Äîthat is, 'down' from higher pressure to lower pressure‚Äîinto (and through) the aorta and the pulmonary trunk respectively. Notably, cardiac muscle perfusion through the heart's coronary vessels doesn't happen during ventricular systole; rather, it occurs during ventricular diastole. Ventricular systole is the origin of the pulse. Right and left ventricular systoles The pulmonary (or pulmonic) valve in the right ventricle opens into the pulmonary trunk, also known as the pulmonary artery, which divides twice to connect to each of the left and right lungs. In the left ventricle, the aortic valve opens into the aorta which divides and re- divides into the several branch arteries that connect to all body organs and systems except the lungs. By its contractions, right ventricular (RV) systole pulses oxygen-depleted blood through the pulmonary valve through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, providing pulmonary circulation; simultaneously, left ventricular (LV) systole pumps blood through the aortic valve, the aorta, and all the arteries to provide systemic circulation of oxygenated blood to all body systems. The left ventricular sytole enables blood pressure to be routinely measured in the larger arteries of the left ventricle of the heart. LV systole is volumetrically defined as the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Similarly, RV systole is defined as the right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). Higher than normal RVEF is indicative of pulmonary hypertension. The time variables of the ventricular systoles are: right ventricle, pulmonary valve-open to valve-closed; left ventricle, aortic valve- open to valve-closed. =Electrical systole= The sinoatrial node (S-A Node) is the heart's natural pacemaker, issuing electrical signaling that travels through the heart muscle, causing it to contract repeatedly in cycle. It is situated at the top of the right atrium adjacent to the junction with the superior vena cava. The S-A Node is a pale yellow structure. For humans, it is approximately 25 mm long, 3‚Äì4 mm wide and 2 mm thick. It contains two types of cells: (a) the small, round P cells which have very few organelles and myofibrils, and (b) the slender elongated transitional cells, which are intermediate in appearance between the P and the ordinary myocardial cells. Intact, the SA node provides continual electrical discharge known as sinus rhythm through the atrial mass, the signals of which then coalesce at the atrioventricular node, there to be organized to provide a rhythmic electrical pulse into and across the ventricles through sodium-, potassium- or calcium- gated ion channels. The continual rhythmic discharge generates a wavelike movement of electrical ripples that stimulate the smooth muscles of the myocardium and cause rhythmic contractions to progress from top to bottom of the heart. As the pulse moves out of the (upper) atria into the (lower) ventricles, it is distributed throughout a muscular network to cause systolic contraction of both ventricular chambers simultaneously. The actual pace of the cycle‚Äîjust how fast or slowly the heart beats‚Äîis cued by messages from the brain, reflecting the brain's responses to conditions of the body, such as pain, emotional stress, level of activity, and to ambient conditions including external temperature, time of day, etc. =Mechanical systole= Electrical systole opens voltage-gated sodium, potassium and calcium channels in cells of myocardium tissue. Subsequently, a rise in intracellular calcium triggers the interaction of actin and myosin in the presence of ATP which generates mechanical force in the cells in the form of muscular contraction, or mechanical systole. The contractions generate intra-ventricular pressure, which is increased until it exceeds the external, residual pressures in the adjacent trunks of both the pulmonary artery and the aorta; this stage, in turn, causes the pulmonary and aortic valves to open. Blood is then ejected from the two ventricles, pulsing into both the pulmonic and aortic circulation systems. Mechanical systole causes the pulse, which itself is readily palpated (felt) or seen at several points on the body, enabling universally adopted methods‚Äîby touch or by eye‚Äîfor observing systolic blood pressure. The mechanical forces of systole cause rotation of the muscle mass around the long and short axes, a process that can be observed as a \\"wringing\\" of the ventricles. Physiological mechanism Systole of the heart is initiated by electrically excitable cells situated in the sinoatrial node. These cells are activated spontaneously by depolarization of the electrical potential across their cell membranes, which causes voltage-gated calcium channels on the cell membrane to open and allow calcium ions to pass through into the sarcoplasm (cytoplasm) of cardiac muscle cells. Calcium ions bind to molecular receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (see graphic), which causes a flux (flow) of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Calcium ions bind to troponin C, causing a conformational (i.e., structural) change in the troponin-tropomyosin protein complex, causing the myosin head (binding) sites on F-actin filamentous proteins to be exposed, which causes muscle contraction to occur. The cardiac action potential spreads distally (or outwardly) to the small branches of the Purkinje tree via the flux of cations through gap junctions that connect the sarcoplasms of adjacent myocytes. The electrical activity of ventricular systole is coordinated by the atrioventricular node, which is a discrete collection of cells that receives electrical stimulation from the left and right atria and can provide an intrinsic (albeit slower) heart pacemaker activity. The cardiac action potential is propagated down electrical pathways through the bundle of His to the Purkinje fibres; this electrical flux causes coordinated depolarisation and excitation-contraction coupling from the apex of the heart up to the roots of the great vessels.  Clinical notation  When blood pressure is stated for medical purposes, it is usually written with the systolic and diastolic pressures separated by a slash, for example, 120/80 mmHg. This clinical notation is not a mathematical figure for a fraction or ratio, nor a display of a numerator over a denominator. Rather, it is a medical notation showing the two clinically significant pressures involved (systole followed by diastole). It is often shown followed by a third number, the value of the heart rate (in beats per minute), which typically is measured jointly with blood pressure readings.

It was released on July 9, 2002, by SideOneDummy Records. This album marked the band's return to an indie label, and was the last album released by the group before their four-year hiatus between 2003 and 2007. In November and December, the group went on a headlining US tour, with support from Bigwig, Slick Shoes and Simple Plan. The album title is a reference to both the elegant Olympic high dive and the death of something beautiful. Dicky Barrett has said in interviews that the title of the album upset his mother greatly, as her maiden name was Swan, as well as her mother's. An earlier version of \\"The Old School Off The Bright\\" was originally featured on a promotional EP titled Fabled Barney and The Population given out at the band's Hometown Throwdown in 2002. The promotional version of the album features an alternate version of the song \\"Seven Ways to Sunday\\". \\"Sugar Free\\" was later featured in the 2006 movie Beerfest. The track \\"I want My City Back\\" is a lament about the loss of The Rathskeller, commonly called The Rat, the club in Boston where the Bosstones got their start.

He is remembered as an influential editor of the Gentleman's Magazine for nearly 40 years; author of a monumental county history of Leicestershire; author of two compendia of biographical material relating to his literary contemporaries; and as one of the agents behind the first complete publication of Domesday Book in 1783. Early life and apprenticeship He was born in Islington, London to Edward Nichols and Anne Wilmot. On 22 June 1766 he married Anne, daughter of William Cradock. Anne bore him three children: Anne (1767), Sarah (1769), and William Bowyer (born 1775 and died a year later). His wife Anne also died in 1776. Nichols was married a second time in 1778, to Martha Green who bore him eight children. Nichols was taken for training by \\"the learned printer\\", William Bowyer the Younger in early 1757.Keith Maslen, ‚ÄòBowyer, William (1699‚Äì1777)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Nichols was formally apprenticed in February 1759 by Bowyer, whom he eventually succeeded. On the death of his friend and master in 1777 he published a brief memoir, which afterwards grew into the Anecdotes of William Bowyer and his Literary Friends (1782). Literary career In 1788, he became editor of the Gentleman's Magazine and remained so till his death. In that periodical, and in his numerous volumes of Anecdotes and Illustrations, he made numerous contributions to literary biography. As his materials accumulated he compiled a sort of anecdotal literary history of the century, based on a large collection of letters. The Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century (1812‚Äì15, nine volumes), into which the original work was expanded, forms only a small part of Nichols's production. Considered one of his most important works, Nichols's monumental History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester, was the most ambitious of the antiquarian county histories (extremely long, but the quality of the content is very variable), a massive compendium of historical notes, manuscripts and engraved plates printed by subscription after an exhaustive survey of the county, and published in eight parts not in chronological order to make up four volumes when complete, from 1795‚Äì1815. It was followed by the Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, consisting of Authentic Memoirs and Original Letters of Eminent Persons, which was begun in 1817 and completed by his son John Bowyer Nichols (1779‚Äì1863) in 1858. The Anecdotes and the Illustrations are mines of valuable information on the authors, printers and booksellers of the time. Nichols and the printing of Domesday Book (1767‚Äì83) Nichols co-operated with Abraham Farley in the production of the 1783 edition of Domesday Book, which he called in his Literary Anecdotes \\"the most invaluable as well as most antient Record in this or any other kingdom\\". Between Farley's appointment as co-editor of the project in 1770 and the final publication of Domesday Book in two volumes in 1783, Nichols assisted Farley in printing and proof-reading the text, and also designed the special \\"record type\\" typeface that was to be used. This was a source of lasting pride to him; he would later say \\"on the correctness and the beauty of this important Work I am content to stake my typographical credit\\". The types created by Nichols for the Domesday project were destroyed, alongside much else of value, in a fire at his office in February 1808.

Heirs and successors John Bowyer Nichols continued his father's various undertakings, and wrote, with other works, A Brief Account of the Guildhall of the City of London (1819). John Gough Nichols (1806‚Äì73), John Bowyer Nichols' eldest son, was also a printer and a distinguished antiquary. He edited the Gentleman's Magazine from 1851 to 1856 and The Herald and Genealogist from 1863 to 1874, and was one of the founders of the Camden Society.

He served as director of the Society of Antiquaries of London from 1771 to 1791; published a major work on English church monuments; and translated and edited a new edition of William Camden's Britannia. He is not to be confused with the Richard Gough who wrote a \\"History of Myddle\\", Shropshire, in 1700. Life Gough was born in London, where his father, Harry Gough, was a prosperous director of the British East India Company and also a member of parliament. In 1751 he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he began his work on British topography, eventually published in 1768. Leaving Cambridge in 1756, without a degree, he began a series of antiquarian excursions in various parts of Great Britain. Gough was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1767, and was its director from 1771 to 1791. As director, he urged the Society to increase the scope of its publications, especially as a means of recording England's Gothic architecture; as the intermittent series Vetusta Monumenta was the only record of its research.Frew 1980. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1775. His books and manuscripts relating to Anglo-Saxon and northern literature, all his collections in the department of British topography, and a large number of his drawings and engravings of other archaeological remains, were bequeathed to the University of Oxford. One notable item in the bequest is the so-called Gough Map, an outstanding medieval map of Britain, which is now known by Gough's name. Works Gough was a precocious child, and at twelve had translated from the French a history of the Bible, which his mother printed for private circulation. Aged fifteen he translated Abb√© Claude Fleury's work on the Israelites; and at sixteen he published an elaborate work entitled Atlas Renovatus, or Geography modernised. In 1773 he began an edition in English of William Camden's Britannia: this was published in 1789, with a second edition appearing in 1806. Meantime he published, in 1786, the first volume of his work the Sepulchral Monuments in Great Britain, applied to illustrate the history of families, manners, habits and arts at the different periods from the Norman Conquest to the Seventeenth Century. This volume, which contained the first four centuries, was followed in 1796 by a second volume containing the 15th century, and an introduction to the second volume appeared in 1799.Badham 1987. Among Gough's minor works are An Account of the Bedford Missal (in manuscript); A Catalogue of the Coins of Canute, King of Denmark (1777); History of Pleshey in Essex (1803); An Account of the Coins of the Seleucidae, Kings of Syria (1804); and \\"History of the Society of Antiquaries of London,\\" prefixed to their Archaeologia.

Barre, a major general of the gendarmerie, became President of Somalia after the 1969 coup d'√©tat that overthrew the Somali Republic following the assassination of President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke. The Supreme Revolutionary Council military junta under Barre reconstituted Somalia as a one-party Marxist‚ÄìLeninist communist state, renaming the country the Somali Democratic Republic and adopting scientific socialism, with support from the Soviet Union. Barre's early rule was characterised by attempts at widespread modernization, nationalization of banks and industry, promotion of cooperative farms, a new writing system for the Somali language, and anti-tribalism. The Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party became Somalia's vanguard party in 1976, and Barre started the Ogaden War against Ethiopia on a platform of Somali nationalism and pan-Somalism. Barre's popularity was highest during the seven months between September 1977 and March 1978 when Barre captured virtually the entirety of the Somali region.Yihun, Belete Belachew. \\"Ethiopian foreign policy and the Ogaden War: the shift from ‚Äúcontainment‚Äù to ‚Äúdestabilization,‚Äù 1977‚Äì1991.\\" Journal of Eastern African Studies 8.4 (2014): 677-691. It declined from the late-1970s following Somalia's defeat in the Ogaden War, triggering the Somali Rebellion and severing ties with the Soviet Union. Opposition grew in the 1980s due to his increasingly dictatorial rule, growth of tribal politics, abuses of the National Security Service including the Isaaq genocide, and the sharp decline of Somalia's economy. In 1991, Barre's government collapsed as the Somali Rebellion successfully ejected him from power, leading to the Somali Civil War, and forcing him into exile where he died in Nigeria in 1995. Early years Mohamed Siad Barre was born in Shilavo, Ogaden which is now present-day Ethiopia in the year 1910. Barre's parents died when he was ten years old, and after receiving his primary education in the town of Luuq in southern Italian Somalia he moved to the capital Mogadishu to pursue his secondary education. Barre seems to have probably participated as a Zapti√© in the southern theatre of the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936, and later joined the colonial police force during the British Somaliland military administration, rising to major general, the highest possible rank.Daniel Compagnon. \\"Le regime Syyad Barre\\"; p. 179 In 1946, Barre supported the Somali Conference (), a political group of parties and clan associations that were hostile to the Somali Youth League and were supported by the local Italian farmers. The group presented a petition to the \\"Four Powers\\" Investigation Commission in order to allow that the administration of the United Nations Trust Territory could be entrusted for thirty years to Italy.Daniel Compagnon. \\"RESSOURCES POLITIQUES, REGULATION AUTORITAIRE ET DOMINATION PERSONNELLE EN SOMALIE LE REGIME SIYYAD BARRE (1969-1991)\\", Volume 1; p.163 In 1950, shortly after Italian Somaliland became a United Nations Trust Territory under Italian administration for ten years, Barre (who was fluent in Italian) attended the Carabinieri police school in Florence for two years. Upon his return to Somalia, Barre remained with the military and eventually became Vice Commander of the Somali Army when the country gained its independence in 1960 as the Somali Republic. In the early 1960s, after spending time with Soviet officers in joint training exercises, Barre became an advocate of Soviet-style Marxist-Leninist government, believing in a socialist government and a stronger sense of Somali nationalism. Seizure of power In 1969, following the assassination of Somalia's second president, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, the military staged the 1969 coup d'√©tat on October 21, the day after Shermarke's funeral, overthrowing the Somali Republic's government. The Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), a military junta led by Major General Barre, Lieutenant Colonel Salaad Gabeyre Kediye and Chief of Police Jama Ali Korshel, assumed power and filled the top offices of the government, with Kediye officially holding the title of \\"Father of the Revolution,\\" although Barre shortly afterwards became the head of the SRC. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic, arrested members of the former government, banned political parties, dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution.Peter John de la Fosse Wiles, The New Communist Third World: an essay in political economy, (Taylor & Francis: 1982), p.279. Presidency Barre with Romanian president Nicolae Ceau»ôescu in 1976 Barre assumed the position of President of Somalia, styled the \\"Victorious Leader\\" (Guulwade), and fostered the growth of a personality cult with portraits of him in the company of Marx and Lenin lining the streets on public occasions.. Barre advocated a form of scientific socialism based on the Qur'an and Marxism, with heavy influences of Somali nationalism. =Supreme Revolutionary Council= The Supreme Revolutionary Council established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate. Barre began a program of nationalising industry and land, and the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the Arab world, eventually joining the Arab League in 1974. That same year, Barre also served as chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union (AU).Oihe Yang, Africa South of the Sahara 2001, 30th Ed., (Taylor and Francis: 2000), p.1025. In July 1976, Barre's SRC disbanded itself and established in its place the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party (SRSP), a one-party government based on scientific socialism and Islamic tenets. The SRSP was an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion by adapting Marxist precepts to local circumstances. Emphasis was placed on the Muslim principles of social progress, equality and justice, which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and its own accent on self-sufficiency, public participation and popular control, as well as direct ownership of the means of production. While the SRSP encouraged private investment on a limited scale, the administration's overall direction was essentially communist. A new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People's Assembly were held. However, the Politburo of Barre's Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party continued to rule. In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place. =Language and anti-clanism= One of the first and principal objectives of the revolutionary regime was the adoption of a standard national writing system. Barre supported the official use of Latin script for the Somali language, replacing Arabic script and Wadaad writing that had been used for centuries. Shortly after coming to power, Barre introduced the Somali language (Af Soomaali) as the official language of education, and selected the modified Somali Latin alphabet developed by the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed as the nation's standard orthography. From then on, all education in government schools had to be conducted in Somali, and in 1972, all government employees were ordered to learn to read and write Somali within six months. The reason given for this was to decrease a growing rift between those who spoke the colonial languages, Italian or English, and those who did not, as many of the high ranking positions in the former government were given to people who spoke either Italian or English. Additionally, Barre also sought to eradicate the importance of the Somali clan system (qabil) within Somalia's government and civil society. The inevitable first question that Somalis asked one another when they met was, '\\"What is your clan?\\", but when this was considered to be against to the purpose of a modern state, Somalis began to pointedly ask, \\"What is your ex-clan?\\". Barre outlawed this question and a broad range of other activities classified as \\"clanism\\", with informers reporting qabilists, those considered to propagate the clan system, to the government, leading to arrests and imprisonment. On a more symbolic level, Barre had repeated a number of times, \\"Whom do you know? is changed to: What do you know?\\", and this incantation became part of a popular street song in Somalia. He also promoted a number of favored greetings, such as the singular jaalle (comrade) or the plural jaalleyaal (comrades).Jaamac, Faarax Maxamed. Aqoondarro waa u Nacab Jacayl. Jamhuuriyadda Dimoqraadiga Soomaaliya, Wasaaradda Hiddaha iyo Tacliinta Sare, 1974. =Nationalism and Greater Somalia= Barre advocated the concept of a Greater Somalia (Soomaaliweyn), which refers to those regions in the Horn of Africa in which ethnic Somalis reside and have historically represented the predominant population. Greater Somalia encompasses Somalia, Djibouti, the Ogaden in Ethiopia, and Kenya's former North Eastern Province, regions of the Horn of Africa where Somalis form the majority of the population to some proportion.The 1994 national census was delayed in the Somali Region until 1997. FDRE States: Basic Information - Somalia , Population (accessed March 12, 2006)Francis Vallat, First report on succession of states in respect of treaties: International Law Commission twenty-sixth session May 6 ‚Äì July 26, 1974, (United Nations: 1974), p.20Africa Watch Committee, Kenya: Taking Liberties, (Yale University Press: 1991), p.269 In July 1977, the Ogaden War broke out after the Barre's government sought to incorporate the various Somali-inhabited territories of the region into a Greater Somalia, beginning with the Ogaden. The Somali national army invaded Ethiopia, which was now under communist rule of the Soviet-backed Derg, and was successful at first, capturing most of the territory of the Ogaden. The invasion reached an abrupt end with the Soviet Union's shift of support to Ethiopia, followed by almost the entire communist world siding against Somalia. The Soviets halted their previous supplies to Barre's regime and increased the distribution of aid, weapons, and training to the Ethiopian government, and also brought in around 15,000 Cuban troops to assist the Ethiopian regime. In 1978, the Somali troops were ultimately pushed out of the Ogaden. =Foreign relations= Control of Somalia was of great interest to both the Soviet Union and the United States due to the country's strategic location at the mouth of the Red Sea. After the Soviets broke with Somalia in the late 1970s, Barre subsequently expelled all Soviet advisers, tore up his friendship treaty with the Soviet Union, and switched allegiance to the West, announcing this in a televised speech in English. Somalia also broke all ties with the Soviet Bloc and the Second World (except China and Romania).Gorman, Robert F. (1981). Political Conflict on the Horn of Africa. Westport, CT: Praeger. . p.208 The United States stepped in and until 1989, was a strong supporter of the Barre government for whom it provided approximately US$100 million per year in economic and military aid, meeting in 1982 with Ronald Reagan to announce the new relationship between the US and Somalia. In September 1972 Tanzanian-sponsored rebels attacked Uganda. Ugandan President Idi Amin requested Barre's assistance, and he subsequently mediated a non- aggression pact between Tanzania and Uganda. For his actions, a road in Kampala was named after Barre. On October 17 and 18, 1977, a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) group hijacked Lufthansa Flight 181 to Mogadishu, holding 86 hostages. West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Barre negotiated a deal to allow a GSG 9 anti-terrorist unit into Mogadishu to free the hostages. In January 1986, Barre and the Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam met in Djibouti to normalise relations between their respective countries . The Ethiopian-Somali agreement was signed by 1988 and Barre disbanded his clandestine anti-Ethiopian organisation the Western Somali Liberation Front . In return, Barre hoped that Mengistu would disarm Somali National Movement rebels active on the Ethiopian side of the border, however did this not materialise since the SNM relocated to Northern Somalia in response to this agreement . =Domestic programs= During the first five years, Barre's government set up several cooperative farms and factories of mass production such as mills, sugar cane processing facilities in Jowhar and Afgooye, and a meat processing house in Kismayo. Another public project initiated by the government was the Shalanbood Sanddune Stoppage: from 1971 onwards, a massive tree-planting campaign on a nationwide scale was introduced by Barre's administration to halt the advance of thousands of acres of wind- driven sand dunes that threatened to engulf towns, roads, and farm land.National Geographic Society (U.S.), National Geographic, Volume 159, (National Geographic Society: 1981), p.765. By 1988, 265 hectares of a projected 336 hectares had been treated, with 39 range reserve sites and 36 forestry plantation sites established.Hadden, Robert Lee. 2007. \\"The Geology of Somalia: A Selected Bibliography of Somalian Geology, Geography and Earth Science.\\" Engineer Research and Development Laboratories, Topographic Engineering Center Between 1974 and 1975, a major drought referred to as the Abaartii Dabadheer (\\"The Lingering Drought\\") occurred in the northern regions of Somalia. The Soviet Union, which at the time maintained strategic relations with the Barre government, airlifted some 90,000 people from the devastated regions of Hobyo and Caynaba. New settlements of small villages were created in the Jubbada Hoose (Lower Jubba) and Jubbada Dhexe (Middle Jubba) regions, with these new settlements known as the Danwadaagaha or \\"Collective Settlements\\". The transplanted families were introduced to farming and fishing, a change from their traditional pastoralist lifestyle of livestock herding. Other such resettlement programs were also introduced as part of Barre's effort to undercut clan solidarity by dispersing nomads and moving them away from clan-controlled land. =Economic policies= As part of Barre's socialist policies, major industries and farms were nationalised, including banks, insurance companies and oil distribution farms. By the mid- to-late-1970s, public discontent with the Barre regime was increasing, largely due to corruption among government officials as well as poor economic performance. The Ogaden War had also weakened the Somali army substantially and military spending had crippled the economy. Foreign debt increased faster than export earnings, and by the end of the decade, Somalia's debt of 4 billion shillings equaled the earnings from seventy-five years' worth of banana exports.. By 1978, manufactured goods exports were almost non-existent, and with the lost support of the Soviet Union the Barre government signed a structural adjustment agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the early 1980s. This included the abolishment of some government monopolies and increased public investment. This and a second agreement were both cancelled by the mid-1980s, as the Somali army refused to accept a proposed 60 percent cut in military spending. New agreements were made with the Paris Club, the International Development Association and the IMF during the second half of the 1980s. This ultimately failed to improve the economy which deteriorated rapidly in 1989 and 1990, and resulted in nationwide commodity shortages. =Car collision= In May 1986, President Barre suffered serious injuries in a life-threatening automobile collision near Mogadishu, when the car that was transporting him smashed into the back of a bus during a heavy rainstorm.World of Information (Firm), Africa review, (World of Information: 1987), p.213. He was treated in a hospital in Saudi Arabia for head injuries, broken ribs and shock over a period of a month.Arthur S. Banks, Thomas C. Muller, William Overstreet, Political Handbook of the World 2008, (CQ Press: 2008), p.1198.National Academy of Sciences (U.S.). Committee on Human Rights, Institute of Medicine (U.S.). Committee on Health and Human Rights, Scientists and human rights in Somalia: report of a delegation, (National Academies: 1988), p.9. Lieutenant General Mohamed Ali Samatar, then Vice President, subsequently served as de facto head of state for the next several months. Although Barre managed to recover enough to present himself as the sole presidential candidate for re-election over a term of seven years on December 23, 1986, his poor health and advanced age led to speculation about who would succeed him in power. Possible contenders included his son-in-law General Ahmed Suleiman Abdille, who was at the time the Minister of the Interior, in addition to Barre's Vice President Lt. Gen. Samatar. =Human rights abuses= Part of Barre's time in power was characterized by oppressive dictatorial rule, including persecution, jailing and torture of political opponents and dissidents. The United Nations Development Programme stated that \\"the 21-year regime of Siyad Barre had one of the worst human rights records in Africa.\\"UNDP, Human Development Report 2001-Somalia, (New York: 2001), p. 42 In January 1990, the Africa Watch Committee, a branch of Human Rights Watch organizational released an extensive report titled \\"Somalia A Government At War with Its Own People\\" composing of 268 pages, the report highlights the widespread violations of basic human rights in the northern regions of Somalia. The report includes testimonies about the killing and conflict in northern Somalia by newly arrived refugees in various countries around the world. Systematic human rights abuses against the dominant Isaaq clan in the north was described in the report as \\"state sponsored terrorism\\" \\"both the urban population and nomads living in the countryside [were] subjected to summary killings, arbitrary arrest, detention in squalid conditions, torture, rape, crippling constraints on freedom of movement and expression and a pattern of psychological intimidation. The report estimates that 50,000 to 60,000 people were killed from 1988 to 1989.\\"Africa Watch Committee, Somalia: A Government at War with its Own People, (New York: 1990), p. 9 Amnesty International went on to report that torture methods committed by Barre's National Security Service (NSS) included executions and \\"beatings while tied in a contorted position, electric shocks, rape of woman prisoners, simulated executions and death threats.\\"Amnesty International, Torture in the Eighties, (Bristol, England: Pitman Press, 1984), p. 127. In September 1970, the government introduced the National Security Law No. 54, which granted the NSS the power to arrest and detain indefinitely those who expressed critical views of the government, without ever being brought to trial. It further gave the NSS the power to arrest without a warrant anyone suspected of a crime involving \\"national security\\". Article 1 of the law prohibited \\"acts against the independence, unity or security of the State\\", and capital punishment was mandatory for anyone convicted of such acts.National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) Committee on Human Rights & Institute of Medicine (U.S.) Committee on Health and Human Rights, Scientists and human rights in Somalia: report of a delegation, (Washington D.C.: National Academy Press, 1988), p. 16. From the late 1970s, and onwards Barre faced a shrinking popularity and increased domestic resistance. In response, Barre's elite unit, the Red Berets (Duub Cas), and the paramilitary unit called the Victory Pioneers carried out systematic terror against the Majeerteen, Hawiye, and Isaaq clans.. The Red Berets systematically smashed water reservoirs to deny water to the Majeerteen and Isaaq clans and their herds. More than 2,000 members of the Majeerteen clan died of thirst, and an estimated 5,000 Isaaq were killed by the government. Members of the Victory Pioneers also raped large numbers of Majeerteen and Isaaq women, and more than 300,000 Isaaq members fled to Ethiopia... = Clannism = After the Ogaden War, Barre adopted a \\"clannism\\" ideology and abandoned his \\"socialist facade\\" to hold onto power . A 120,000 strong army was built for internal repression of the public and to encourage rural clan based conflicts in addition to urban clan directed massacres by specialised armed forces . Barre also singled out the Isaaq clan for a \\"neo- fascist\\" type punishment resulting in a \\"semi-colonial\\" type subjugation which fuelled collective self assertion to supporters of the Somali National Movement . By the mid-1980s, more resistance movements supported by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988. The bombardment was led by General Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, Barre's son-in-law, and resulted in the deaths of 50,000 people in the north. =Rebellion and ouster= After fallout from the unsuccessful Ogaden campaign, Barre's administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion of participation in the 1978 coup d'√©tat attempt.ARR: Arab report and record, (Economic Features, ltd.: 1978), p.602. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed.New People Media Centre, New people, Issues 94‚Äì105, (New People Media Centre: Comboni Missionaries, 2005). However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.Nina J. Fitzgerald, Somalia: issues, history, and bibliography, (Nova Publishers: 2002), p.25. A new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People's Assembly were held. However, Barre and the Politburo of his Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party continued to rule. In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place. By that time, the moral authority of Barre's ruling Supreme Revolutionary Council had begun to weaken. Many Somalis were becoming disillusioned with life under military dictatorship. The regime was further weakened in the 1980s as the Cold War drew to a close and Somalia's strategic importance was diminished. The government became increasingly totalitarian, and resistance movements, supported by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led in 1991 to the outbreak of the civil war, the toppling of Barre's regime and the disbandment of the Somali National Army (SNA). Among the militia groups that led the rebellion were the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), United Somali Congress (USC), Somali National Movement (SNM) and the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM), together with the non-violent political oppositions of the Somali Democratic Movement (SDM), the Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA) and the Somali Manifesto Group (SMG). Siad Barre escaped from his palace towards the Kenyan border in a tank. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. In the south, armed factions led by USC commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.Library Information and Research Service, The Middle East: Abstracts and index, Volume 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p.327. Exile and death After fleeing Mogadishu on January 26, 1991 with his son-in-law General Morgan, Barre temporarily remained in Burdhubo, in southwestern Somalia, his family's stronghold. From there, he launched a military campaign to return to power. He twice attempted to retake Mogadishu, but in May 1991 was overwhelmed by General Mohamed Farrah Aidid's army and forced into exile. Barre initially moved to Nairobi, Kenya, but opposition groups there protested his arrival and the Kenyan government's support for him. In response to the pressure and hostilities, he moved two weeks later to Nigeria. Barre died of a heart attack on January 2, 1995, in Lagos. He was buried in Garbaharey, Somalia.

It has been an influential movement in 20th and 21st century Argentine politics. Since 1946, Peronists won 10 out of the 13 presidential elections in which they have been allowed to run. The main Peronist party is the Justicialist Party. The policies of Peronist presidents have differed greatly, but the general ideology has been described as \\"a vague blend of nationalism and labourism\\" or populism. Per√≥n became Argentina's minister of labour after participating in the 1943 military coup and was elected president of Argentina in 1946. He introduced social programs that benefited the working class, supported labor unions and called for additional involvement of the state in the economy. In addition, he helped industrialists. Per√≥n was hugely popular and gained even more admiration through his wife Eva, who championed for the rights of migrant workers and was beloved by the people. Eva was so beloved that in 1949 Juan Per√≥n formed the Female Peronist Party, a new wing within his own party under her leadership.Meade, T. A. (2016). A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 204 Due to rising inflation and other economic problems, the military overthrew Per√≥n in 1955. The Peronist party was banned and it was not until 1973 that open elections were held again in which Per√≥n was again elected president. Per√≥n died the next year and his widow Isabel took his place as president. Under her leadership, Peronism was no longer characterized by anti-imperialism and revolutionary sentiments, but by a strong anti-communism and economic liberalism. Per√≥n's death led to disunity and the military overthrew Isabel in 1976. Peronist Carlos Menem was president for ten years. His policies were very different from previous Peronists as he focused on privatization, free-market policies and good international relations with the United States. N√©stor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner were presidents for twelve years. The Kirchners returned to economic nationalism and near-autarky.  Overview  The pillars of the Peronist ideal, known as the \\"three flags\\", are social justice, economic independence and political sovereignty. Peronism can be described as a third position ideology as it rejects both capitalism and communism. Peronism espouses corporatism and thus aims to mediate tensions between the classes of society, with the state responsible for negotiating compromise in conflicts between managers and workers. Peronism gained popularity in Argentina after the failure of its government to listen and recognize the needs of its middle class. As president of Argentina, Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen did not listen to the workers pleas for better wages and better working conditions after World War I. Yrigoyen was notorious for failing to oppose Argentina‚Äôs oligarchy. According to Teresa Meade in A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present, Yrigoyen failed \\"to establish a middle-class-based political system from 1916 to 1930 ‚Äì mainly because his Radical Civic Union had neither the will nor the means to effectively oppose the dominance of the oligarchy\\".Meade, T. A. (2016). A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present. Wiley-Blackwell. p.202 Many in power did not work to change the way things were. However, Juan Per√≥n, at that time a military officer, used his experiences in Europe and his admiration for certain leaders like Mussolini to create a new political atmosphere that he felt would better the lives of citizens in Argentina.Minster, C. (2019, July 28). Biography of Juan Per√≥n, Argentina's Populist President. Retrieved from https://www.thoughtco.com/biography-of-juan-peron-2136581 Unlike Yrigoyen, Per√≥n \\"recognized that the industrial working class was not necessarily an impediment, and could be mobilized to serve as the basis for building a corporatist state that joined the interests of labor with those of at least a large section of the national bourgeoisie to promote a nationalist agenda\\". However, it is a generally ill-defined ideology as different and sometimes contradictory sentiments are expressed in the name of Peronism. The legacy and thought of Per√≥n have transcended the confines of any single political party and bled into the broader political landscape of Argentina, therefore Peronists are usually described as a political movement. Traditionally, the Peronist movement has drawn its strongest support from the working class and sympathetic unions and has been characterized as proletarian in nature. From the perspective of opponents, Peronism is an authoritarian ideology. Per√≥n was often compared to fascist dictators, accused of demagoguery and his policies derided as populist. Proclaiming himself the embodiment of nationality, Per√≥n's government often silenced dissent by accusing opponents of being unpatriotic. The corporatist character of Peronism drew attacks from socialists who accused his administration of preserving capitalist exploitation and class division. Conservatives rejected its modernist ideology and felt their status threatened by the ascent of the Peronist apparat. Liberals condemned the Per√≥n regime's arbitrariness and dictatorial tendencies. Defenders of Peronism also describe the doctrine as populist, albeit in the sense that they believe it embodies the interests of the masses and in particular the most vulnerable social strata. Admirers hold Per√≥n in esteem for his administration's anti-imperialism and non-alignment as well as its socially progressive initiatives. Amongst other measures introduced by Per√≥n's governments, social security was made universal while education was made free to all who qualified and working students were given one paid week before every major examination. Vast low-income housing projects were created and paid vacations became standard. All workers (including white-collar employees) were guaranteed free medical care and half of their vacation-trip expenses and mothers-to-be received three paid months off prior to and after giving birth. Workers' recreation centers were also constructed throughout the country.  Ideology  = Twenty Peronist Tenets = From Peron's \\"Peronist Philosophy\\": # \\"A true democracy is that one in which the government does what the people want and defends only one interest: the people's.\\" # \\"Peronism is essentially of the common people. Any political elite is anti-people, and thus, not Peronist.\\" # \\"A Peronist works for the movement. Whoever, in the name of Peronism, serves an elite or a leader, is a Peronist in name only.\\" # \\"For Peronism, there is only one class of person: those who work.\\" # \\"Working is a right that creates the dignity of men; and it's a duty, because it's fair that everyone should produce as much as they consume at the very least.\\" # \\"For a good Peronist, there is nothing better than another Peronist.\\" (In 1973, after coming back from exile, in a conciliatory attempt, and in order to lessen the division in society, Peron reformed this tenet to: \\"For an Argentine, there is nothing better than another Argentine.\\") # \\"No Peronist should feel more than what he is, nor less than what he should be. When a Peronist feels more than what he is, he begins to turn into an oligarch.\\" # \\"When it comes to political action, the scale of values of every Peronist is: Argentina first; the movement second; and thirdly, the individuals.\\" # \\"Politics are not an end, but a means for the well-being of Argentina: which means happiness for our children and greatness for our nation.\\" # \\"The two arms of Peronism are social justice and social help. With them, we can give a hug of justice and love to the people.\\" # \\"Peronism desires national unity and not struggle. It wants heroes, not martyrs.\\" # \\"Kids should be the only privileged class.\\" # \\"A government without doctrine is a body without soul. That's why Peronism has a political, economic and social doctrine: Justicialism.\\" # \\"Justicialism is a new philosophy of life: simple, practical, of the common people, and profoundly Christian and humanist.\\" # \\"As political doctrine, Justicialism balances the right of the individual and society.\\" # \\"As an economic doctrine, Justicialism proposes a social market, putting capital to the service of the economy and the well-being of the people.\\" # \\"As a social doctrine, Justicialism carries out social justice, which gives each person their rights in accordance to their social function.\\" # \\"Peronism wants an Argentina socially 'fair', economically 'free' and politically 'sovereign'.\\" # \\"We establish a centralized government, an organized State and a free people.\\" # \\"In this land, the best thing we have is our people.\\"  Per√≥n's policies  Per√≥n's ideas were widely embraced by a variety of different groups in Argentina across the political spectrum. Some of Per√≥n's personal views later became a burden on the ideology, such as his anti- clericalism, which did not strike a sympathetic chord with upper-class Argentinians. Peronism is widely regarded as a form of corporate socialism, or \\"right-wing socialism\\".\\"Buenos Aires Journal\\". The New York Times. 13 January 1990. Per√≥n's public speeches were consistently nationalist and populist. It would be difficult to separate Peronism from corporate nationalism, for Per√≥n nationalized Argentina's large corporations, blurring distinctions between corporations and government. At the same time, the labor unions became corporate, ceding the right to strike in agreements with Per√≥n as Secretary of Welfare in the military government from 1943‚Äì1945. In exchange, the state was to assume the role of negotiator between conflicting interests. Peronism also lacked a strong interest in matters of foreign policy other than the belief that the political and economic influences of other nations should be kept out of Argentina‚Äîhe was somewhat isolationist. Early in his presidency, Per√≥n envisioned Argentina's role as a model for other countries in Latin America and beyond, but such ideas were ultimately abandoned. Despite his oppositional rhetoric, Per√≥n frequently sought cooperation with the United States government on various issues. = Criticism of Per√≥n = Political opponents maintain that Per√≥n and his administration resorted to organised violence and dictatorial rule; that Per√≥n showed contempt for any opponents, and regularly characterised them as traitors and agents of foreign powers. Per√≥n subverted freedoms by nationalising the broadcasting system, centralising the unions under his control and monopolising the supply of newspaper print. At times, Per√≥n also resorted to tactics such as illegally imprisoning opposition politicians and journalists, including Radical Civic Union leader Ricardo Balbin; and shutting down opposition papers, such as La Prensa. Per√≥n's admiration for Benito Mussolini is well documented. Many scholars categorise Peronism as a fascist ideology.Brennan, James P. Peronism and Argentina. Rowman & Littlefield. 1998. Carlos Fayt believed that Peronism was \\"an Argentine implementation of Italian fascism\\". Hayes reaches the conclusion that \\"the Peronist movement produced a form of fascism that was distinctively Latin American\\". One of the most vocal critics of Peronism was the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. After Per√≥n ascended to the presidency in 1946, Borges spoke before the Argentine Society of Writers (SADE) by saying: > Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships > breed cruelty; more loathsome still is the fact that they breed idiocy. > Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of caudillos, prearranged cheers or > insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline > usurping the place of clear thinking[...] Fighting these sad monotonies is > one of the duties of a writer. Need I remind readers of Mart√≠n Fierro or Don > Segundo that individualism is an old Argentine virtue.Borges: A Life. p. > 295. = Attitudes towards Jews = Argentina has had the largest Jewish population in Latin America since before Per√≥n came to power. After becoming president, he invited members of the Jewish community to participate in his government. One of his advisors was Jos√© Ber Gelbard, a Jewish man from Poland. Peronism did not have an antisemitic bias.Crassweller, David. Per√≥n and the Enigmas of Argentina. W.W. Norton and Company. 1987. p. 221. . The Jewish Virtual Library writes that while Juan Per√≥n had sympathized with the Axis powers, \\"Per√≥n also expressed sympathy for Jewish rights and established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1949. Since then, more than 45,000 Jews have immigrated to Israel from Argentina\\".Weiner, Rebecca. \\"Post World War II\\". Jewish Virtual Library. In the book Inside Argentina from Per√≥n to Menem, author Laurence Levine, also former president of the U.S.‚ÄìArgentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that \\"although anti-Semitism existed in Argentina, Per√≥n's own views and his political associations were not anti-Semitic\\".Levine, Laurence. Inside Argentina from Per√≥n to Menem: 1950‚Äì2000 From an American Point of View. p. 23. While Per√≥n allowed many Nazi criminals to take refuge in Argentina, he also attracted many Jewish immigrants. Argentina has a Jewish population of over 200,000 citizens, one of the largest in the world.Valente, Marcela. \\"Continuing Efforts to Conceal Anti-Semitic Past\\". IPS-Inter Press Service. 27 April 2005.  Peronism after Per√≥n  = Fall of Per√≥n = A military and civilian coup, the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, led by General Eduardo Lonardi, overthrew the Per√≥n regime in 1955. During the coup, Lonardi drew analogies between Per√≥n and Juan Manuel de Rosas. Lonardi used the quote \\"neither victors nor vanquished\\" (), which was used by Justo Jos√© de Urquiza after deposing Rosas in the battle of Caseros. The official perspective was that Per√≥n was \\"the second tyranny\\", the first one being Rosas; and that both ones should be equally rejected and conversely both governments that ousted them should be praised. For this end, they draw the line of historical continuity \\"May ‚Äì Caseros ‚Äì Libertadora\\", matching the coup with the May Revolution and the defeat of Rosas. This approach backfired. Per√≥n was highly popular and the military coup unpopular, so Peronists embraced the comparison established between Rosas and Per√≥n, but viewing him with a positive light instead.Devoto. pp. 278‚Äì281. Nationalist historians draw then their own line of historical continuity \\"San Mart√≠n ‚Äì Rosas ‚Äì Per√≥n\\".Chaneton. p. 37. The absence of Per√≥n, who lived for 16 years in exile in Francoist Spain, is an important key to understanding Peronism. After he went into exile, he could be invoked by a variety of Argentine sectors opposed to the current state of affairs. In particular, the personality cult of Eva Per√≥n was conserved by supporters while despised by the \\"national bourgeoisie\\". In the 1960s, John William Cooke's writings became an important source of left-wing revolutionary Peronism. Left-wing Peronism was represented by many organizations, from the Montoneros and the Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas to the Peronist Youth, the Frente Revolucionario Peronista and the Revolutionary Peronist Youth, passing by Peronismo en Lucha or Peronismo de Base.Servetto, Alice. \\"El derrumbe temprano de la democracia en C√≥rdoba: Obreg√≥n Cano y el golpe policial (1973‚Äì1974)\\". Estudios Sociales. n¬∞ 17. Late 1999, revised paper of a 1997 conference at the National University of La Pampa, 19 pages. On the other hand, older Peronists formed the base of the orthodox bureaucracy, represented by the Uni√≥n Obrera Metal√∫rgica (Augusto Vandor, famous for his 1965 slogan \\"For a Peronism without Per√≥n\\" and declaring as well that \\"to save Per√≥n, one has to be against Per√≥n\\", or Jos√© Ignacio Rucci). Another current was formed by the \\"62 Organizaciones 'De pie junto a Per√≥n'\\", led by Jos√© Alonso and opposed to the right-wing Peronist unionist movement. In the early 1970s, left-wing Peronism rejected liberal democracy and political pluralism as the mask of bourgeois domination. The anti-communist right-wing Peronism also rejected it in the name of corporatism, claiming to return to a \\"Christian and humanist, popular, national socialism\\". = Per√≥n restored = By 1970, many groups from opposite sides of the political spectrum had come to support Per√≥n, from the left-wing and Catholic Montoneros to the fascist-leaning and strongly antisemitic Tacuara Nationalist Movement, one of Argentina's first guerrilla movements. In March 1973, H√©ctor Jos√© C√°mpora, who had been named as Per√≥n's personal delegate, was elected President of Argentina, paving the way for the return of Per√≥n from Spain. A few months after Per√≥n's return and the subsequent Ezeiza massacre during which the Peronist Left and Right violently clashed, new elections were held in September with Per√≥n elected president and his third wife Isabel vice president. Jos√© C√°mpora, a left-wing Peronist, had been replaced temporarily by interim President Ra√∫l Alberto Lastiri while Per√≥n had chosen to openly support the Peronist right. On 1 October 1973, Senator Humberto Martiarena, who was the national secretary of the Superior Council of the National Justicialist Movement, publicized a document giving directives to confront \\"subversives, terrorist and Marxist groups\\" which had allegedly initiated a \\"war\\" inside the Peronist organizations. From then on, the Superior Council took a firm grip on the Peronist organizations to expel the Left from it. On that same day, a meeting took place among President Ra√∫l Lastiri, Interior Minister Benito Llamb√≠, Social Welfare Minister Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, general secretary of the Presidency Jos√© Humberto Martiarena and various provincial governors, which has been alleged to have been the foundational act of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance death squad.Gaggero, Manuel Justo. \\"El general en su laberinto\\". Pagina/12. 19 February 2007. Per√≥n's health was failing throughout his third and final term, which ended abruptly with his death and the succession of his wife to the presidency on 1 July 1974, but she was ousted by the military in another coup d'√©tat in 1976, paving the way for the ensuing dictatorship's '\\"National Reorganization Process\\" and the subsequent \\"Dirty War\\" against everyone deemed subversive, especially leftists, including left-wing Peronists. = Menem years = The official Peronist party is the Justicialist Party (PJ), which was the only Peronist party for a long time. During the government of Carlos Menem, a group of legislators led by Carlos √Ålvarez known as the \\"Group of 8\\" left the party, claiming that the government was not following Peronist doctrines. They created a new party, the Broad Front. A short time later, Jos√© Octavio Bord√≥n left the PJ as well, fearing that he might lose a primary election against Menem and thus he created his own party to take part in the 1995 elections and allied with √Ålvarez' Broad Front in the Front for a Country in Solidarity (Frepaso) coalition. Similar breakaway movements followed frequently after that, creating many small parties which were led by single politicians claiming to be the authentic inheritors of Peronism. = Kirchnerism = N√©stor Kirchner addressing a multitude at Gualeguaych√∫ The PJ did not participate as such during the 2003 elections. The party allowed all three precandidates to run for the general elections, using small parties created for that purpose. N√©stor Kirchner won the elections running on a Front for Victory ticket. As he did not disband his party after the election, Kirchnerism relies on both the PJ and the Front for Victory.

Paul Henri Mallet (20 August 1730 ‚Äì 8 February 1807) was a Genevan writer.  Life  He was born and educated in Geneva. He became tutor in the family of the count of Calenberg in Lower Saxony. In 1752 he was appointed professor of belles lettres to the academy at Copenhagen. He was naturally attracted to the study of the ancient literature and history of Denmark, his adopted country, and in 1755 he published the first fruits of his researches, under the title Introduction √† L'histoire du Danemarch o√π l'on traite de la religion, des moeurs, des lois, et des usages des anciens Danois. A second part, more particularly relating to Danish literature, Monuments de la mythologie et de la poesie des Celtes, et particulierement des anciens Scandinaves, was issued in 1756, and was also translated into Danish. A translation into English, with notes and preface, by Bishop Thomas Percy, was issued in 1770 under the title of Northern Antiquities (republished with additions in 1847). The book had a wide circulation, and attracted much attention on account of its being the first (though a very defective) translation into French of the Edda. The king of Denmark showed his appreciation by choosing Mallet to be preceptor of the crown prince. In 1760 he returned to Geneva, and became professor of history in his native city. While there he was requested by the czarina to undertake the education of the heir-apparent of Russia (afterwards the Czar Paul I), but declined. A more appealing invitation led to his accompanying Lord Mountstuart in his travels through Italy and thence to England, where Mallet was presented at court and commissioned to write the history of the house of Brunswick. He had previously received similar commission from the landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) for the reparation of a history of the house of Hesse, and both works were completed in 1785. The quietness of a literary life was rudely broken by the French Revolution, to which he was openly hostile. His leanings to the unpopular side were so obnoxious to his fellow-citizens that he was obliged to quit his native country in 1792, and remained in exile till 1801. He died at Geneva.  Works  A memoir of his life and writings, by Sismondi, was published at Geneva in 1807. Besides the Introduction to the History of Denmark, his principal works are: *Histoire du Danemarch (3 vols., Copenhagen, 1758‚Äì1777) *Histoire de la maison de Hesse (4 vols., 1767‚Äì1785) *Histoire de la maison de Brunswick (4 vols., 1767‚Äì1785) *Histoire de la maison et des etats du Mecklenbourg (1796) *Histoire des Suisses ou Helvetiens (4 vols., Geneva, 1803) (mainly an abridgment of Johannes von M√ºller's great history) *Histoire de la ligue hanseatique (1805).

In amphibians, females may be grasped by the head, waist, or armpits, and the type of amplexus is characteristic of some taxonomic groups. Amplexus involves direct contact between male and female, distinguished from other forms of external fertilization, such as broadcast spawning, where sperm and eggs are freely shed into water without direct contact by individuals. In order for amplexus to be initiated, male frogs must first find a mate by attracting one through calls, typically in the evening. Once a male has successfully attracted a mate, the process of amplexus begins, while the unsuccessful males are forced to continue their search for a mate through further calls. The competition for a female mate among males is considered intense, and it is not uncommon for a male amphibian to attack an already-amplexed pair of amphibians. When a male amphibian attacks an amplexed pair of amphibians, he is trying to force the other male to release its grasp of the female, so he can then mate with her. Male amphibians are also known to show mate-guarding behaviour, which is shown after amplexus, and it is the male's attempt to prevent the female amphibian from mating with other males. The duration of amplexus has been found to vary across species. In some species it may last for many days, while in others it may last a few hours. Despite the variation in the duration of amplexus across species, typically all species that exhibit this behaviour have to use their forelimb muscles for the duration of amplexus. Studies have found that this reproductive behaviour of amplexus can come with different fitness costs, due to the fact that amplexus can occur for prolonged periods of time. For instance, a study found that when a male amphibian is grasping and holding onto a female amphibian, this can lead to the impairment of the female's ability to move or to feed. After conducting experiments, researchers confirmed that amplexus does decrease a female's locomotor performance (e.g., swimming, walking) as well as the feeding rates. With regard to the cost to the male engaged in amplexus, male amphibians have been found to not feed at all during amplexus.  Types  Many types of amplexus are identified in the literature. However, two types of amplexus are more common than others, known as inguinal and axillary amplexus. These two types of amplexus have been classified based on the position of the male amphibian relative to the female. When a male amphibian clasps a female around her waist (inguinal region) using his forelimbs, this is considered inguinal amplexus. By contrast, when a male amphibian clasps behind the forelimbs (axillary region) of the female, this is considered axillary amplexus.  Physiological and hormonal function  = Physiology = Amplexus has been found to involve different muscles in both male and female amphibians. The forelimb muscles in both males and females have been identified as the key muscles for amplexus that most species use. These forelimb muscles that are used during amplexus are typically larger in males than females, and for males these muscles contain more oxidative fibers, which could mean that amplexus involves an increased rate of aerobic metabolism. In addition to those forelimb muscles being larger in males, male frogs also typically have keratin pads or nuptial pads, which are located on their thumbs and contribute to the success of amplexus by assisting in gripping the female for the duration of amplexus. This amplexus behaviour allows the amphibians' cloacae to be in close contact, while gametes are released. Additionally, amplexus is thought to help with the alignment of the reproductive tracts of both males and females, which furthermore contributes to successful fertilization. A female amphibian may not always be receptive to a male amphibian who is trying to initiate amplexus, as the female may not be ready to produce eggs. When the female is not ready to engage in amplexus, she will simply vibrate her body, which will then be felt by the male who is clasped to her and he will then stop the amplexus behaviour. = Hormones = Two major hormones have been identified to be involved in amplexus. The hormone arginine vasotocin (AVT) has been identified as having an effect on the calling behaviours produced by these male amphibians when searching for a female mate, as AVT increased the amount of calling behaviour produced in male amphibians. Additionally, it is believed that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) has an influence on amplexus in amphibians, as it has been found to produce or initiate this behaviour in many anuran amphibians. Furthermore, both arginine vasotocin and gonadotropin-releasing hormone have been found to be involved in the sexual behaviour of male amphibians. The stress hormone corticosterone has also been identified as associated with the sexual behaviour of amplexus. A study conducted on red-spotted newts found an acute increase in corticosterone for both males and females who were engaged in the behaviour of amplexus. However, overall it was found that males have a higher level of corticosterone compared to females, as amplexus is seen as more energetically costly to males. The increase in corticosterone found in females could be attributed to amplexus preventing them from foraging for food. Amphibians European common toad (Bufo bufo). Common toad mating ball (multiple amplexus). Red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas), Costa Rica =Anurans= Amplexus chiefly occurs aquatically, but some terrestrial anurans (frogs and toads) like the disc-tongued frogs (Discoglossidae) perform amplexus on land. In crown-group anurans, like the true frogs (Ranidae), the tree frogs (Hylidae), and the true toads (Bufonidae), amplexus is axillary (in the armpits). Other anurans (the Archaeobatrachia, Sooglossidae and Myobatrachidae), show the ancestral state which is inguinal or lumbar amplexus (abdominal, in front of the hindlegs). Some species show cephalic amplexus where the head of the female is held while others show complete lack of amplexus. Additionally, anurans species have been observed to engage in multiple amplexus, which can also be referred to as a mating ball, as many toads attach themselves to a female trying to initiate amplexus. However, multiple amplexus is not common among anurans, which could indicate that the costs associated with multiple amplexus are higher than the advantages associated with it. For female anurans, the idea of multiple amplexus would probably be more advantageous, because mating with more than one male would increase fertilization chances or increase offspring genetic diversity. Multiple amplexus would typically be common in explosive breeding amphibians, when there is a larger number of adults ready to breed at a breeding site in a short period of time. When this occurs female amphibians are viewed as a very important resource for males, as there are typically more males present than females, thus leading to more chances for multiple amplexus to occur. In most anurans, the males deposit sperm onto the eggs as they are being laid, however males of the genus Ascaphus possess an intromittent organ, unique among anurans, for internal fertilization. Internal fertilization does occur in a few other genera, including Nectophrynoides, Mertensophryne, and Eleutherodactylus.Duellman, W. E. and L. Trueb. 1986. Biology of Amphibians. New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company.Linzey, D. 2001. Vertebrate Biology, McGraw Hill Publishers, New York. =Newts= In the case of newts, the process of amplexus is often observed soon after the newts become seasonally active. In the Western USA, for example, this time is typically soon after the onset of the winter rainy season, when intermittent streams and vernal pools become available as a breeding habitat. The rough-skinned newt is a specific widespread example of a newt in the western USA that can be observed in quiet stream pools and shallow ponds engaging in amplexus.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Rough-skinned Newt (Taricha granulosa) , Globaltwitcher, ed. N. Stromberg During amplexus in newts, males will typically show the behaviour of tail fanning and chin rubbing which is thought to prompt the mating receptivity of the female newt. Studies have shown that male newts who have deeper tail-fins have better control of females during amplexus and are also more successful in catching the females for amplexus. Additionally, it has been found that the probability of a male newt who has a deeper tail-fin to achieve amplexus is greater than those newts who do not contain a deeper tail-fin, as male newts tend to use their tails during male-male competition. When a male newt, who is unpaired, encounters a female and male newt engaged in amplexus, the unpaired newt will try to displace the paired male newt by using wrestling tactics. A study examining the wrestling behaviour of newts found that of the observed wrestling encounters, 90% were \\"won\\" by the paired male, meaning he would retain the female newt. The study found that the invading unpaired newt rarely successfully displaces the paired male newt, engaged in amplexus. Horseshoe crabs Amplectant pair of Limulus polyphemus. The male is the smaller individual. Amplexus occurs in all four species of horseshoe crab. Horseshoe crabs typically go ashore for amplexus in high tide, and end up on beaches where the eggs are more protected. The first pair of walking legs is used to tightly clasp the female in all species, and the second pair is also employed in all but Limulus polyphemus. A male horseshoe crab develops modified claspers during sexual maturity when the male moults; these modified claspers can then help during the process of amplexus. The male's pair of posterior claspers are known for having the ability to maintain long-term amplexus which have been found to always attach to the female's opisthosoma during amplexus. In contrast, the male's anterior claspers have been found to attach to the female's opisthosoma as well, but on the lateral edges of the opisthosoma and function to resist displacement from environmental factors. Uniquely, amplexus is most likely to occur between horseshoe crabs when the female horseshoe crab has a hard shell. Additionally, males who inhabit a clean shell are more likely to enter amplexus, compared to males who contain a dirty shell, as it seems that females have a preference for clean shells on males. A male horseshoe crab's claspers may also be an important factor of consideration for the initiation of amplexus. Since claspers are used for the attachment to the female, claspers that are in good condition are more successful for the initiation of amplexus. If a male horseshoe crab has a damaged or missing clasper, then that puts the male at a disadvantage and increases the probability of being displaced by other competing male crabs.  Other animals  Fossil evidence suggests that a certain euthycarcinoid (an extinct arthropod) from the Cambrian may also have mated by amplexus.

Users and providers may refer to such a message as a PXT, a picture message, or a multimedia message. The MMS standard extends the core SMS (Short Message Service) capability, allowing the exchange of text messages greater than 160 characters in length. Unlike text-only SMS, MMS can deliver a variety of media, including up to forty seconds of video, one image, a slideshow of multiple images, or audio. The first MMS-capable phones were introduced around 2002 in conjunction with the first GSM network. The Sony Ericsson T68i is widely believed to be the first MMS-capable cell phone, while many more hit North American markets beginning in 2004 and 2005. The most common use involves sending photographs from camera-equipped handsets. Media companies have utilized MMS on a commercial basis as a method of delivering news and entertainment content, and retailers have deployed it as a tool for delivering scannable coupon codes, product images, videos, and other information. The 3GPP and WAP groups fostered the development of the MMS standard, which is now continued by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA).  History  Multimedia messaging service was built using the technology of SMS messaging, first developed in 1984 as a captive technology which enabled service providers to \\"collect a fee every time anyone snaps a photo.\\" Between 2010 and 2013, MMS traffic in the U.S. increased by 70% from 57 billion to 96 billion messages sent. This is due in part to the wide adoption of smartphones.  Technical description  MMS messages are delivered in a different way from SMS. The first step is for the sending device to encode the multimedia content in a fashion similar to sending a MIME message (MIME content formats are defined in the MMS Message Encapsulation specification). The message is then forwarded to the carrier's MMS store and forward server, known as the MMSC (Multimedia Messaging Service Centre). If the receiver is on a carrier different from the sender, then the MMSC acts as a relay, and forwards the message to the MMSC of the recipient's carrier using the Internet.\\"Overview of MMS\\" , mbuni Once the recipient's MMSC has received a message, it first determines whether the receiver's handset is \\"MMS capable\\" or not. If it supports the standards for receiving MMS, the content is extracted and sent to a temporary storage server with an HTTP front-end. An SMS \\"control message\\" containing the URL of the content is then sent to the recipient's handset to trigger the receiver's WAP browser to open and receive the content from the embedded URL. Several other messages are exchanged to indicate the status of the delivery attempt.\\"Sending MMS Notifications and Content\\" , now.sms Before delivering content, some MMSCs also include a conversion service that will attempt to modify the multimedia content into a format suitable for the receiver. This is known as \\"content adaptation\\". If the receiver's handset is not MMS capable, the message is usually delivered to a web-based service from where the content can be viewed from a normal internet browser. The URL for the content is usually sent to the receiver's phone in a normal text message. This behavior is usually known as a \\"legacy experience\\" since content can still be received the user. The method for determining whether a handset is MMS capable is not specified by the standards. A database is usually maintained by the operator, and in it each mobile phone number is marked as being associated with a legacy handset or not. This method is unreliable, however, because customers can independently change their handsets, and many of these databases are not updated dynamically. MMS does not utilize operator-maintained \\"data\\" plans to distribute multimedia content, which is only used if the operator clicks links inside the message. E-mail and web-based gateways to the MMS system are common. On the reception side, the content servers can typically receive service requests both from WAP and normal HTTP browsers, so delivery via the web is simple. For sending from external sources to handsets, most carriers allow a MIME encoded message to be sent to the receiver's phone number using a special e-mail address combining the recipient's public phone number and a special domain name, which is typically carrier-specific.  Challenges  There are some interesting challenges with MMS that do not exist with SMS: Handset configuration can cause problems sending and receiving MMS messages. * Content adaptation: Multimedia content created by one brand of MMS phone may not be entirely compatible with the capabilities of the recipient's MMS phone. In the MMS architecture, the recipient MMSC is responsible for providing for content adaptation (e.g., image resizing, audio codec transcoding, etc.), if this feature is enabled by the mobile network operator. When content adaptation is supported by a network operator, its MMS subscribers enjoy compatibility with a larger network of MMS users than would otherwise be available. * Distribution lists: Current MMS specifications do not include distribution lists nor methods by which large numbers of recipients can be conveniently addressed, particularly by content providers, called Value-added service providers (VASPs) in 3GPP. Since most SMSC vendors have adopted FTP as an ad-hoc method by which large distribution lists are transferred to the SMSC prior to being used in a bulk-messaging SMS submission, it is expected that MMSC vendors will also adopt FTP. * Bulk messaging: The flow of peer-to-peer MMS messaging involves several over-the-air transactions that become inefficient when MMS is used to send messages to large numbers of subscribers, as is typically the case for VASPs. For example, when one MMS message is submitted to a very large number of recipients, it is possible to receive a delivery report and read-reply report for each and every recipient. Future MMS specification work is likely to optimize and reduce the transactional overhead for the bulk-messaging case. * Handset configuration: Unlike SMS, MMS requires a number of handset parameters to be set. Poor handset configuration is often blamed as the first point of failure for many users. Service settings are sometimes preconfigured on the handset, but mobile operators are now looking at new device management technologies as a means of delivering the necessary settings for data services (MMS, WAP, etc.) via over-the-air programming (OTA). * WAP Push: Few mobile network operators offer direct connectivity to their MMSCs for content providers. This has resulted in many content providers using WAP push as the only method available to deliver 'rich content' to mobile handsets. WAP push enables 'rich content' to be delivered to a handset by specifying the URL (via binary SMS) of a pre-compiled MMS, hosted on a content provider's web server. A consequence is that the receiver who pays WAP per kb or minute (as opposed to a flat monthly fee) pays for receiving the MMS, as opposed to only paying for sending one, and also paying a different rate. Although the standard does not specify a maximum size for a message, 300 kB and 600 kB are the recommended sizes used by networks\\"MMS definition\\", GSM Arena for compatibility with MMS 1.2 and MMS 1.3 devices respectively. The limit for the first generation of MMS was 50 kB.\\"MMS Developer's Guide\\", Ericsson Mobility World USA, October 2001  Interfaces  MMSC Reference Architecture * MM1: the 3GPP interface between MMS User Agent and MMS Center (MMSC, the combination of the MMS Relay & Server) * MM2: the 3GPP interface between MMS Relay and MMS Server * MM3: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and external servers * MM4: the 3GPP interface between different MMSCs * MM5: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and HLR * MM6: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and user databases * MM7: the 3GPP interface between MMS VAS applications and MMSC * MM8: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and the billing systems * MM9: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and an online charging system * MM10: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and a message service control function * MM11: the 3GPP interface between MMSC and an external transcoder  See also  * Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) * Rich Communication Services (RCS) * Mobile marketing * Short code * Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language References  External links   3GPP standards Mobile telecommunication services Mobile telecommunications standards Open Mobile Alliance standards ","title":"Multimedia Messaging Service"},{"id":"242409","text":"Ottoman Grand Vizier A vizier (or wazir) (, rarely ; wazƒ´r, vazƒ´r) is a high-ranking political advisor or minister in the Muslim world. The Abbasid caliphs gave the title wazir to a minister formerly called katib (secretary), who was at first merely a helper but afterwards became the representative and successor of the dapir (official scribe or secretary) of the Sassanian kings.R. A. Nicholson, A Literary History of the Arabs, p. 257 In modern usage, the term has been used for government ministers in much of the Middle East and beyond. Several alternative spellings are used in English, such as vizir, wazir, and vezir. Etymology The word entered into English in 1562 from the Turkish vezir (\\"counselor\\"), derived from the Arabic wazƒ´r (\\"viceroy\\"). Wazir itself has two possible etymologies: *The most accepted etymology is that it is derived from the Arabic wazara (\\"to bear a burden\\"), from the Semitic root W-Z-R. The word is mentioned in the Quran, where Aaron is described as the wazir (helper) of Moses, as well as the word wizr (burden) which is also derived from the same root.Goy·π≠ayn, ≈†elomo D..

Historical ministerial titles Diwan of a Mughal Vizier. The office of vizier arose under the first Abbasid caliphs, and spread across the Muslim world. The vizier stood between sovereign and subjects, representing the former in all matters touching the latter.\\"vizier\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2010, Retrieved on 2010-06-17. The 11th-century legal theorist al-Mawardi defined two types of viziers: wazƒ´r al-tanfƒ´dh (\\"vizier of execution\\"), who had limited powers and served to implement the caliph's policies, and the far more powerful wazƒ´r al-tafwƒ´d (\\"vizier with delegated powers\\"), with authority over civil and military affairs, and enjoyed the same powers as the caliph, except in the matter of the succession or the appointment of officials. Al-Mawardi stressed that the latter, as an effective viceroy, had to be a Muslim well versed in the Shari'a, whereas the former could also be a non-Muslim or even a slave, although women continued to be expressly barred from the office. Historically, the term has been used to describe two very different ways: either for a unique position, the prime minister at the head of the monarch's government (the term Grand Vizier always refers to such a post), or as a shared 'cabinet rank', rather like a British secretary of state. If one such vizier is the prime minister, he may hold the title of Grand Vizier or another title. =In Islamic states= An Iranian Afsharid Vizier. a Vazir of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (Shah of Persia) *The title was first used in the early Abbasid Caliphate, cf. Vizier (Abbasid Caliphate). *In Muslim Persia, the prime minister under the political authority of the Shahanshah was commonly styled Vazƒ´r-e Azam ('Supreme -, i.e. Grand Vizier'; alternative titles include Atabeg-e Azam and SardƒÅr-e Azam), and various Ministers held cabinet rank as vazir, including a Vazir-i-Daftar (minister for finance) and a Vazir-i-Lashkar (war portfolio). * In al-Andalus, the Umayyad Caliphs of C√≥rdoba appointed a varying number of viziers, as heads of departments in the bureaucracy, ministers with specific tasks, and royal councillors; at one point, in 1008, there were as many as 29 viziers at the same time. Unlike the Islamic east, the senior office of the Umayyad state was that of the chamberlain (hajib). Under the Taifa kingdoms the title proliferated and became a generic court title. During the later Umayyads, viziers were also appointed outside the capital as provincial governors or commanders, a practic which continued until the fall of the Emirate of Granada in the 15th century. The Spanish word alguacil (governor, official with civil or criminal duties) derives from this. * In Muslim Egypt, the most populous Arab country: **Vizier under the Fatimid Caliphs. **Again since the effective end of Ottoman rule, remarkably since 1857 (i.e. before the last Wali (governor), Isma\`il Pasha, was raised Khedive (circa Viceroy, on 8 June 1867), exchanged for the western prime ministers on 28 August 1878 (before the formally independent sultanate was proclaimed). *During the days of the Ottoman Empire, the Grand Vizier was the‚Äîoften de facto ruling‚Äîprime minister, second only to the Sultan and was the leader of the Divan, the Imperial Council. \\"Vizier\\" was also the title of some Ottoman provincial governors, use of the title often indicating a greater degree of autonomy for the province involved and the greater prestige of the title holder (this was, for example, a major issue in the Bosnian uprising of 1831). *In the Sherifian kingdom of Morocco (historically a sultanate till the incumbent assumed the higher royal style of Malik on 14 August 1957, shortly after the end of the simultaneous French and Spanish protectorates; the additional Islamic title Amir al- Mu¬¥minin \\"Commander of the Faithful\\" stayed in use), a Sadr al-A'zam (Grand Vizier) was in office until 22 November 1955, replaced since 7 December 1955 a (part-political) Prime Minister; Vizier was the style of a minister of state (other titles for various portfolios). *In the Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz (later merged into present-day Saudi Arabia), the sole Vizier was (10 June 19163 October 1924) the future second king Ali ibn Hussein al-Hashimi, under his father Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi (the first to assume the title Malik, i.e. King, instead of Grand Sharif), maintained after the assumption of the Caliphal style (only 11 March 19243 October 1924) *In the 'regency' of Tunisia, under the Husainid Dynasty, various ministers of the Bey, including: **Wazir al-Akbar (or El Ouzir El K√©bir): 'great minister', i.e. grand vizier, chief minister or prime minister. **Wazir al-'Amala (or El Ouzir El Amala): Minister for the Interior. **Wazir al-Bahr (or El Ouzir El Bahr): Minister 'of the Sea', i.e. for the Navy/ Marine. **Wazir al-Harb (or El Ouzir El Harb): Minister for the Army or Minister for War. **Wazir al-Istishara (or El Ouzir El Istichara): Minister-Counsellor. **Wazir al-Qalam: Minister of the Pen. **Wazir ud-Daula (or El Ouzir El Dawla): Minister of State. **Wazir us-Shura (or El Ouzir Ech Choura): Privy Counsellor. *In Oman the Hami/Sultan's chief minister was styled Wazir till 1966, but in 1925‚Äì1932 there was also or instead a chairman of the council of Ministers; since 1970 the style is prime minister. *In the Bengal Sultanate, many local officials had the title of Wazir/Uzir *Viziers to the Sultans of Zanzibar (a branch of the Omani dynasty); since 1890 filled by British, also known as first ministers, (1 July 191323 February 1961) the British Resident (Minister)s, an extremely direct form of indirect rule (before and after chief- or prime ministers, generally native). *Grand Viziers to the Sultan of Sokoto ‚Äì this is however disputed. The title \\"Waziri\\" is apparently a derivative of this word, and is a highly regarded chieftaincy title in most of northern Nigeria. Indeed, most of the emirs in northern Nigeria have a \\"Waziri\\", who is usually a high-ranking adviser to the emir. *In pre- and colonial (notably British) India many rulers, even some Hindu princes, had a vizier as chief minister ‚Äì compare Diwan, Nawab wasir, Pradhan, etc. *In the (former) sultanate of the Maldives (Divehi language), the prime minister was styled Bodu Vizier, and various Ministers held cabinet rank as vazierin (plural), including Hakura'a (portfolio of Public Works), Shahbandar (Navy portfolio, also admiral in chief), Vela'ana'a (Foreign Affairs). * In Afghanistan, under the Durrani dynasty, the chief minister was styled Vazƒ´r-e Azam or Wazir-i-azam (1801‚Äì1880); the Vazƒ´r-e DarbƒÅr or Wazir al-durbar was the ('House') Minister of the Royal Court. * List of Ghaznavid Viziers Modern post-monarchy use Wazƒ´r is the standard Arabic word for a government minister. Prime ministers are usually termed as Ra'ƒ´s al-Wuzara (literally, president of the ministers) or al-Wazƒ´r al-'Awwal (prime \\"first\\" minister). The latter term is generally found in the Maghreb, while the former is typical of usage in the Mashriq (broadly defined, including Egypt, Sudan, Levant, Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula). Thus, for example, the Prime Minister of Egypt is in Arabic a wazƒ´r. In Brunei the vizier is known as Pengiran Bendahara. In Iran the ministers of government are called Vazƒ´r in Persian (e.g. foreign/health Vazƒ´r), and prime minister of state before the removal of the post, was called as Nokhost Vazƒ´r. In Pakistan, the prime minister (de facto ruling politician, formally under the president) is called Vazƒ´r-e Azam (Persian for Grand vizier), other Ministers are styled vazirs. In India, Vazƒ´r is the official translation of minister in the Urdu language, and is used in ministerial oath taking ceremonies conducted in Urdu. In East Africa ‚Äì Kenya and Tanzania, ministers are referred to as Waziri in Swahili and prime ministers as Waziri Mkuu. In the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan is sometimes given the honorific title of Wazir In Brunei, Viziers are divided into 5 titles, although two remain vacant since Brunei independence. *The current head of vizier or Perdana Wazir of Brunei is Prince Mohamed Bolkiah. His full title is His Royal Highness Perdana Wazir Sahibul Himmah Wal-Waqar Prince Haji Mohamed Bolkiah. *His Royal Highness Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja Permaisuara Prince Haji Sufri Bolkiah *His Royal Highness Pengiran Digadong Sahibul Mal Prince Haji Jefri Bolkiah *Pengiran Pemancha Sahibul Rae' Wal-Mashuarah ‚Äì vacant *Pengiran Temanggong Sahibul Bahar ‚Äì vacant Anachronistic historical use It is common, even among historians, to apply relatively contemporary terms to cultures whose own authentic titles are (or were when the habit took root) insufficiently known, in this case to pre-Islamic antiquity. *In ancient Egypt the highest-ranking government official, appointed by the pharaoh and acting as his chancellor (chief administrator; Egyptian: taty), is called vizier by modern researchers. The term is also used for the chief administrators of Upper and Lower Egypt during the times when the administration of the country was headed by two officials, thus there was a vizier for the North (Lower Egypt, the Nile Delta), and a vizier for the South (Upper Egypt). However at times the viceroy of Nubia (a military governor general, sometimes a prince of the Pharaoh's blood) and/or the High Priest of Amun (the temple complex at Thebes gradually amassed sufficient possessions and income to rival the crown) rose to equal or even superior power; some pharaohs are even believed to have lost real political preeminence to the 'kingmakers'. :Thus in modern language- translations of the Bible, in Genesis chapter 41, Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob, is called Vizier to Pharaoh. In this same chapter of Genesis, Pharaoh changed his newly appointed Vizier's name to Zaphenath-paneah. *The term is used to designate the highest official of the kingdom of Ebla (head of the administration; Eblaite: lugal sa-za). Princely title In the rare case of the Indian princely state of Jafarabad (Jafrabad, founded c. 1650), ruled by Thanadars, in 1702 a state called Janjira was founded, with rulers (six incumbents) styled wazir; when, in 1762, Jafarabad and Janjira states entered into personal union, both titles were maintained until (after 1825) the higher style of Nawab was assumed. Art In contemporary literature and pantomime, the \\"Grand Vizier\\" is a character stereotype and is usually portrayed as a scheming backroom plotter and the clear power behind the throne of a usually bumbling or incompetent monarch. A well-known example of this is the sinister character of Jafar in the Disney animated film Aladdin, who plots and uses magic to take over the entire Kingdom of Agrabah under the nose of the nation's na√Øve sultan, just as Jaffar in the 1940 movie The Thief of Bagdad dethroned his master, caliph Ahmad. Others include Zigzag from The Thief and the Cobbler (the original inspiration for the character of Jafar in Disney's Aladdin), the comic book character Iznogoud, Prince Sinbad's advisor Yusuf in the DC Vertigo series Fables, and the villains of the video games Prince of Persia and King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow. Perhaps the origin of this character archetype is the biblical account of Esther. The book details the rise of a Jewish woman to Queen of Persia, and her role in stopping the plot of Haman, chief advisor to the Persian king, to wipe out all Jews living in Persia. Throughout history the notion of the sinister Grand Vizier has often been invoked when a political leader appears to be developing a cozy relationship with a spiritual advisor of questionable scruples or talents. This stereotype is frequently mentioned in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, as for example in both Sourcery and Interesting Times. Another instance of a sinister Grand Vizier in entertainment can be found in the science fiction series Lexx, the primary antagonist in the second season being Mantrid, the self-proclaimed \\"greatest Bio-Vizier of all time.\\" Some famous viziers in history *Yahya ibn Khalid of Harun al Rashid (Whose son Jafar bin Yahya was an inspiration for the aforementioned Arabian Nights Jafar) *Amir Kabir of the Qajar dynasty in Iran history *Hasanak vazir of the Ghaznavid dynasty in Iran history *Almanzor of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba was the de facto ruler of Islamic Spain *Nizam al-Mulk of Malik Shah I in Seljuks history *Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. *Sokollu Mehmed Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. *K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha and his son K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. Influence on chess In Shatranj, from which modern chess developed, the piece corresponding to the modern chess \\"queen\\" (though far weaker) was often called Wazƒ´r. Up to the present, the word for the queen piece in chess is still \\"vazƒ´r\\" in Persian, \\"vezir\\" in Turkish, \\"wazir\\" in Arabic, \\"vez√©r\\" in Hungarian (meaning \\"leader\\"), and \\"ferz' (—Ñ–µ—Ä–∑—å)\\" in Russian.

He is voiced by American actor Jonathan Freeman, who also portrayed the character in the Broadway musical adaptation. Jafar also appears in the sequel to Aladdin, but he is not in the third film or the TV series. An inspiration to the character is the villain Jafar, played by Conrad Veidt in The Thief of Bagdad, from which Aladdin borrows several character ideas and plot elements. The Jafar of Disney's Aladdin plays essentially the same part as the character from the 1940 film, and is drawn with notable similarity to Veidt's looks. He is loosely based on the real-life Persian vizier Ja'far ibn Yahya.  Development  Animator Andreas Deja decided to design Jafar in a way he was contrasting to the other characters, with many vertical lines against the curvy designs based on Al Hirschfeld. Jonathan Freeman, who composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman met when he auditioned for Little Shop of Horrors and had previously invited Freeman to audition for both The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, said that the artwork was what got him truly interested in the role. He stated that \\"once I saw those heavy lidded eyes, that long narrow face, I knew that Jafar was going to be something really special.\\" He was the first actor cast, and spent one year and nine months recording dialogue; he went months without any other actors to interact, and later interrupted theater tours to fly to Los Angeles and record newly written lines. When Deja first met Freeman, he was surprised to see the lack of physical similarity to the character, but included some of Freeman's acting and gesturing into Jafar's animation.  Appearances  = Aladdin = In Aladdin, Jafar is the Grand Vizier of Agrabah, the Sultan's most trusted advisor. He is also an evil sorcerer. Jafar secretly plots to obtain the Genie's magical oil lamp and rule Agrabah. Early in the film, Aladdin is imprisoned in the palace dungeons, as arranged by Jafar due to his influence over the guards. He lies to Princess Jasmine claiming Aladdin has already been executed while he pretends to be shocked that he had mistakenly believed that Aladdin abducted her. Jafar (disguised as a fellow prisoner) approaches Aladdin, striking a deal with him. In exchange for Aladdin's help in retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, Jafar reveals an escape route from the prison and promises him a reward if he succeeds, it is soon revealed that the reward is death. When the plan fails, Aladdin and the lamp are lost. The Sultan later scolds Jafar for supposedly executing an innocent life behind his back without consulting him, in which Jafar pretends to regret his actions and promises not to do it again. When his pet parrot Iago suggests an alternative plan, Jafar decides to use the hypnotic powers of his cobra-headed staff to manipulate the Sultan into mandating a marriage between himself and Jasmine. This plan also instigates Jafar's lust towards Jasmine and thus he genuinely wants to have her as his bride. However, he is impeded by Aladdin, who had discovered the Genie and used his first wish to become a Prince. Seeing ‚ÄúPrince Ali‚Äù as a potential threat to his plans and a rival for Jasmines‚Äôs hand in marriage, he plots to dispose of him. After a second attempt by Jafar on his life, Aladdin (with the help of the Genie and his second wish) survives and then exposes Jafar's plot against the Sultan; however, Jafar learns that Aladdin possesses the lamp before making his escape. Iago steals the lamp from Aladdin and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. Jafar uses his first two wishes to become Sultan and the world's most powerful sorcerer. Jafar assumes control of the palace (which is lifted off the ground and put on the main top of a mountain by Genie) and banishes Aladdin to a frozen wasteland. Jafar then turns the Sultan into a puppet, allowing Iago to torture the Sultan by force-feeding him crackers as revenge for the crackers the Sultan fed Iago. A horrified Jasmine begs Jafar to stop and Jafar does so. Jafar, seeking a queen to rule Agrabah alongside him, offers Jasmine his hand in marriage. Jasmine angrily refuses and throws a cup of wine in his face. An angered Jafar decides to use his final wish to wish for Jasmine to fall desperately in love with him. Genie tries to inform Jafar that he cannot use his magic to make people fall in love, but Jafar, grabbing him by the beard, demands him to do it anyway. Their argument causes him to not notice that Aladdin has returned and Jasmine decides to help Aladdin steal back the lamp by pretending that she is now in love with Jafar. Jafar, believing that Genie has somehow granted him his wish, goes up to Jasmine to seduce her without realizing she is tricking him. He notices Aladdin, however, from the reflection of Jasmine's crown, and he realizes the whole thing was a ruse. Aladdin battles Jafar (who has turned into a giant cobra) and taunts him with the fact that he is only the second-most powerful being on Earth after Genie, who was the one who gave him his power in the first place and can very easily take it away. Realizing that what Aladdin says is true and that he‚Äôs still ‚Äúsecond best‚Äù, Jafar, consumed by his hunger for power, uses his final wish to become an all-powerful genie, in an attempt to rule the whole universe. However, as Jafar revels in his newfound phenomenal cosmic power, he finds out too late that Aladdin has tricked him into wasting his wish on becoming a genie, since genies are not free beings, and becomes trapped in a magic lamp of his own, and the lamp is sent into the Cave of Wonders by the Genie. = The Return of Jafar = In The Return of Jafar, Jafar's lamp is found by Abis Mal, who releases Jafar from the lamp. Jafar plots to get revenge on Aladdin. He nearly succeeds at killing Aladdin and taking control of the palace, but Iago, who has changed sides, thwarts his plans and destroys his lamp with the lava, obliterating Jafar for good in the resulting explosion. As a result, Jafar was never seen again in Aladdin and the King of Thieves or in the television series, but was often referred to by name by the other characters. = Hercules (1998 TV series) = In an episode of Hercules: The Animated Series called \\"Hercules and the Arabian Night\\", Jafar makes another attempt at revenge and is temporarily resurrected by Hercules's arch-enemy, Hades. He has lost his status as an all-powerful immortal genie after dying, but Hades gives him a new cobra staff that makes him flesh and blood as long as he holds it, and the two villains team up to get rid of Aladdin and Hercules. However, due to Aladdin's wit and Hercules's strength, Jafar is defeated for the final time, being pulled into the River Styx forever. = Aladdin (2019 film) = Depicted younger in the 2019 live- action version, Jafar is still the grand vizer, but more emphasis is placed on his past as a thief in his youth and his ambition to use Agrabah to invade the kingdom of Sherebad out of revenge for his time in its dungeons. The Sultan's wife and Princess Jasmine's late mother, the Queen, was stated to have been a Princess of Sherebad prior to her marriage to the Sultan, and it is possible that Jafar arranged her murder as both revenge for his imprisonment and possibly to instigate war between the two kingdoms. The film also presents Jafar as a foil to Aladdin, the former explicitly comparing their thief backgrounds and desire to improve their social status. While Aladdin wants just enough to live comfortably, Jafar is shown to never be satisfied with what he has gained as long as there are those greater than himself. Aladdin uses that character flaw to trick Jafar into using his last wish to become a genie, resulting in his imprisonment and being thrown into the Cave of Wonders by the Genie. Marwan Kenzari played the role. = Kingdom Hearts = Jafar debuted in Kingdom Hearts as one of the members of Maleficent's inner circle. Here, he plans to use The Heartless and take over Agrabah while he attempts to locate both Jasmine (as she is one of the Princesses of Heart) and Agrabah's Keyhole. Jafar eventually manages to steal Genie's lamp from Aladdin and kidnap Jasmine in the process. Sora, Aladdin, Donald Duck and Goofy track him to the Cave of Wonders, where Jafar used his first wish to reveal the world's keyhole. Upon arrival in the lamp chamber, they engage Jafar in battle after he used his second wish to enlist Genie's help in the fight. Upon his defeat, Jafar uses his final wish to become a Genie and battles the team again, only to be defeated and sealed away in the lamp. In Kingdom Hearts II, Jafar's lamp is found by the Peddler, making him a target for Pete as he reveals his intent to make Jafar into a Heartless under his control. Once Pete is driven off, the lamp is placed within the palace for safe keeping. However, Jafar is later released by the Peddler and he threatens Iago into helping him get Sora and his friends on a wild goose chase to their death while he captures Princess Jasmine. After the heroes arrive, with Iago taking a hit meant for Aladdin, Sora defeats Jafar, causing him to implode with his lamp dissolving soon after. Facsimiles of Jafar appear in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, based on Sora's memories, and Kingdom Hearts: Coded, based on the digitized data from Jiminy's Journal. = Other appearances = In the Disney's Hollywood Studios version of Fantasmic! Nighttime Show Spectacular, Jafar is one of the villains the Evil Queen evokes to fight Mickey Mouse and ruin his imagination. Jafar appears with Maleficent, Ursula and Oogie Boogie in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom Halloween-themed fireworks program HalloWishes at Mickey's Not- So-Scary Halloween Party. Jafar is featured in many episodes of Disney's House of Mouse where he is often found in the audience. In one episode \\"Donald's Lamp Trade\\", Jafar hypnotizes Donald Duck to steal a lamp for him, but it turns out that he only wanted a clock-like lamp and not the real magical one. Jafar also appears in another episode \\"Pete's House of Villains\\" in which he keeps the other Aladdin characters from coming into House of Mouse. He also appears briefly in Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse and appears in Mickey's House of Villains as the leader of Disney Villains. A live-action version of Jafar appears in the Once Upon a Time spin-off Once Upon a Time in Wonderland. Naveen Andrews portrays the character, an ally of the Red Queen. In this continuity, Jafar is the illegitimate son of the Sultan, and his interest in genies stems from his mentor and lover, Amara, who discovered a ritual that could be used to rewrite the laws of magic using the power of three genies and two sorcerers. Jafar betrayed Amara by transforming her into his serpent staff so that he could have her power for himself. Andrews did not reprise his role in Once Upon a Time's sixth season due to a scheduling conflict, and he was replaced by Oded Fehr.

A competitive advantage may include access to natural resources, such as high-grade ores or a low-cost power source, highly skilled labor, geographic location, high entry barriers, and access to new technology. Overview Competitive advantage is the leverage a business has over its competitors. This can be gained by offering clients better and greater value. Advertising products or services with lower prices or higher quality piques the interest of consumers. Target markets recognize these unique products or services. This is the reason behind brand loyalty, or why customers prefer one particular product or service over another. Value proposition is important when understanding competitive advantage. If the value proposition is effective, that is, if the value proposition offers clients better and greater value, it can produce a competitive advantage in either the product or service. The value proposition can increase customer expectations and choices. Michael Porter defined the two ways in which an organization can achieve competitive advantage over its rivals: cost advantage and differentiation advantage. Cost advantage is when a business provides the same products and services as its competitors, albeit at a lesser cost. Differentiation advantage is when a business provides better products and services as its competitors. In Porter's view, strategic management should be concerned with building and sustaining competitive advantage. Competitive advantage seeks to address some of the criticisms of comparative advantage. Competitive advantage rests on the notion that cheap labor is ubiquitous and natural resources are not necessary for a good economy. The other theory, comparative advantage, can lead countries to specialize in exporting primary goods and raw materials that trap countries in low-wage economies due to terms of trade. Competitive advantage attempts to correct this issue by stressing on maximizing scale economies in goods and services that garner premium prices (Stutz and Warf 2009). The term competitive advantage refers to the ability gained through attributes and resources to perform at a higher level than others in the same industry or market (Christensen and Fahey 1984, Kay 1994, Porter 1980 cited by Chacarbaghi and Lynch 1999, p. 45). The study of this advantage has attracted profound research interest due to contemporary issues regarding superior performance levels of firms in today's competitive market. \\"A firm is said to have a competitive advantage when it is implementing a value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential player\\" (Barney 1991 cited by Clulow et al.2003, p. 221). Successfully implemented strategies will lift a firm to superior performance by facilitating the firm with competitive advantage to outperform current or potential players (Passemard and Calantone 2000, p. 18). To gain competitive advantage, a business strategy of a firm manipulates the various resources over which it has direct control, and these resources have the ability to generate competitive advantage (Reed and Fillippi 1990 cited by Rijamampianina 2003, p. 362). Superior performance outcomes and superiority in production resources reflect competitive advantage (Day and Wesley 1988 cited by Lau 2002, p. 125). The quotes above signify competitive advantage as the ability to stay ahead of present or potential competition. Also, it provides the understanding that resources held by a firm and the business strategy will have a profound impact on generating competitive advantage. Powell (2001, p. 132) views business strategy as the tool that manipulates resources and creates competitive advantage. Hence, viable business strategy may not be adequate unless it possesses control over unique resources that have the ability to create such a relatively unique advantage. The three forms of generic competitive strategy Michael Porter, a graduate of Harvard University, wrote a book in 1985 which identified three strategies that businesses can use to tackle competition. This book was named the ninth most influential management book of the 20th century. These approaches can be applied to all businesses whether they are product-based or service-based. He called these approaches generic strategies. They include cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. These strategies have been created to improve and gain a competitive advantage over competitors. These strategies can also be recognized as the comparative advantage and the differential advantage. =Cost leadership strategy= Cost leadership is a business's ability to produce a product or service that will be at a lower cost than other competitors. If the business is able to produce the same quality product but sell it for less, this gives them a competitive advantage over other businesses. Therefore, this provides a price value to the customers. Lower costs will result in higher profits as businesses are still making a reasonable profit on each good or service sold. If businesses are not making a large enough profit, Porter recommends finding a lower-cost base such as labor, materials, and facilities. This gives businesses a lower manufacturing cost over those of other competitors. The company can add value to the customer via transfer of the cost benefit to them. =Differential strategy= A differential advantage is gained when a business's products or services are different from its competitors. In his book, Michael Porter recommended making those goods or services attractive to stand out from their competitors. The business will need strong research, development, and design thinking to create innovative ideas. These improvements to the goods or service could include delivering high quality to customers. If customers see a product or service as being different from other products, consumers are willing to pay more to receive these benefits. =Focus strategy= Focus strategy ideally tries to get businesses to aim at a few target markets rather than trying to target everyone. This strategy is often used for smaller businesses since they may not have the appropriate resources or ability to target everyone. Businesses that use this method usually focus on the needs of the customer and how their products or services could improve their daily lives. In this method, some firms may even let consumers give their inputs for their product or service. This strategy can also be called the segmentation strategy, which includes geographic, demographic, behavioral, and physical segmentation. By narrowing the market down to smaller segments, businesses are able to meet the needs of the consumer. Porter believes that once businesses have decided what groups they will target, it is essential to decide if they will take the cost leadership approach or differentiation approach. Focus strategy will not make a business successful. Porter mentions that it is important to not use all 3 generic strategies because there is a high chance that companies will come out achieving no strategies instead of achieving success. This can be called \\"stuck in the middle\\", and the business won't be able to have a competitive advantage. When businesses can find the perfect balance between price and quality, it usually leads to a successful product or service. A product or service must offer value through price or quality to ensure the business is successful in the market. To succeed, it's not enough to be \\"just as good as\\" another business. Success comes to firms that can deliver a product or service in a manner that is different, meaningful, and based on their customers' needs and desires. Deciding on the appropriate price and quality depends on the business's brand image and what they hope to achieve in relation to their competition. Underlying internal factors Positioning is an important marketing concept. The main purpose of positioning is often to create the right perceptions in comparison to competitors. Thus, it creates competitive advantage. This positioning, or competitive advantage, is based on creating the right \\"image\\" or \\"identity\\" in the minds of the target group. This positioning decision exists of selecting the right core competencies to build upon and emphasize. Therefore, both corporate identity and core competencies are underlying internal factors of competitive advantage. =Corporate identity= The operational model for managing corporate reputation and image of Gray and Balmer (1998) proposes that corporate identity, communication, image, and reputation are the fundamental components of the process of creating competitive advantage. Corporate identity through corporate communication creates corporate image and reputation, with an end result of competitive advantage. Corporate identity is the reality of an organization. It refers to the distinct characteristics or core competencies of the organization. It is the mental picture of the company held by its audiences. Corporate communication refers to all the official and informal communication sources, through a variety of media, by which the company outsources its identity to its audiences or stakeholders. Corporate communication is the bridge between corporate identity and corporate image or reputation. The above-stated process has two main objectives, namely to create the intended image in the minds of the company's principal constituents and managing the process to create a favourable reputation in the minds of the important stakeholders. Gray and Balmer (1998) say that a strong image can be built through a coordinated image-building campaign and reputation, on the other hand, requires a praiseworthy identity that can only be shaped through consistent performance. =Core competencies= A core competency is a concept introduced by Prahalad and Hamel (1990). Core competencies are part of the corporate identity; they form the foundation of corporate competitiveness. Core competencies fit within the \\"resource-based view of the firm\\" Wernerfelt, Birger. (1984) \\"A resource‚Äêbased view of the firm.\\" Strategic management journal, 5(2),171-180. Barney, Jay, Mike Wright, and David J. Ketchen Jr.(2001), \\"The resource-based view of the firm: Ten years after 1991.\\" Journal of management 27 (6), 625-641. Resources can be tangible or intangible. A firm's knowledge assets are an important intangible source of competitive advantage. For firm knowledge to provide competitive advantage, it must be generated, codified, and diffused to others inside of the organization. Many different types of knowledge can serve as a resource based advantage: manufacturing processes, technology, or market based assets such as knowledge of customers or processes for new product development.Moorman, Christine, and Anne S. Miner. (1997), \\"The impact of organizational memory on new product performance and creativity.\\" Journal of marketing research, 34 (1), 91-106. Firms with a knowledge-based core competency can increase their advantage by learning from \\"contingent workers\\" such as technical experts, consultants, or temporary employees. Those outsiders bring knowledge inside of a firm -- e.g., understanding of competing technologies. Moreover, interactions with contingent workers can provoke the firm to codify knowledge that was tacit in order to communicate with the temporary employees.Matusik, Sharon F., and Charles WL Hill (1998). \\"The utilization of contingent work, knowledge creation, and competitive advantage.\\" Academy of management review, 23 (4), 680-697. The benefits of these interactions with outsiders increases with the \\"absorptive capacity\\" of the firm.Matusik, Sharon F., and Michael B. Heeley (2005), \\"Absorptive capacity in the software industry: Identifying dimensions that affect knowledge and knowledge creation activities.\\" Journal of Management 31 (4), 549-572. However, there is some risk that these interactions cause leakage or dilution of knowledge assets to others who later hire the same temporary employees.Ritala, Paavo, and Pia Hurmelinna-Laukkanen (2009) \\"What's in it for me? Creating and appropriating value in innovation- related coopetition.\\" Technovation, 29 (12), 819-828. The competitiveness of a company is based on the ability to develop core competencies. A core competency is, for example, a specialised knowledge, technique, or skill. Yang (2015) concluded, with the examination of a long-term development model, that developing core competencies and effectively implementing core capabilities are important strategic actions for any enterprise in order to pursue high long-term profits. In the end, real advantage can be created by the management's ability to unify corporate-wide technologies and production skills into competencies that capacitate individual businesses to adapt quickly to changing opportunities. To sustain leadership in a chosen core competency area, companies should seek to maximize their competency factors in the core products like being important in positioning its values, distinctive (differentiated), superior, communicable (visibility), unique, affordable, and profitable. When a company achieves this goal, it allows it to shape the evolution of an end market.

The event is thought to have been caused by an extensive atmospheric dust veil, possibly resulting from a large volcanic eruption in the tropics or in Iceland. Its effects were widespread, causing unseasonable weather, crop failures, and famines worldwide. Documentary evidence The Byzantine historian Procopius recorded in 536 CE in his report on the wars with the Vandals, \\"during this year a most dread portent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness ‚Ä¶ and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear\\"., gives this quote as \\"The Sun gave forth its light without brightness, like the moon during this whole year, and it seemed exceedingly like the Sun in eclipse\\". In 538, the Roman Senator Flavius Cassiodorus also stated that the light of the sun was weak and that crops had failed. See: \\"25. Senator, Praetorian Praefect, to his deputy Ambrosius, an Illustris.\\" Michael the Syrian (1126-1199), a patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church, recorded that during the reign of Justian II, the sun shone feebly for a year and a half. From pp. 220-221: \\"Or, un peu auparavant, en l'an 848, il y eut un signe dans le soleil. ‚Ä¶ , et le vin avait le go√ªt de celui qui provient de raisins acides.\\" (However, a little earlier, in the year 848 [according to the Greek calendar; 536/537 AD according to the Christian calendar], there was a sign in the sun. One had never seen it [before] and nowhere is it written that such [an event] had happened [previously] in the world. If it were not [true] that we found it recorded in most proven and credible writings, and confirmed by men worthy of belief, we would not have written it [here]; for it's difficult to conceive. So it is said that the sun was darkened, and that its eclipse lasted a year and a half, that is, eighteen months. Every day it shone for about four hours and yet this light was only a feeble shadow. Everyone declared that it would not return to the state of its original light. Fruits didn't ripen, and wine had the taste of what comes from sour grapes.)

Scientific evidence Tree ring analysis by dendrochronologist Mike Baillie, of the Queen's University of Belfast, shows abnormally little growth in Irish oak in 536 and another sharp drop in 542, after a partial recovery.Baillie, M.G.L. (1994). \\"Dendrochronology Raises Questions About the Nature of the AD 536 Dust-Veil Event.\\" The Holocene fig. 3 p. 215. Similar patterns are recorded in tree rings from Sweden and Finland, in California's Sierra Nevada, and in rings from Chilean Fitzroya trees. Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica show evidence of substantial sulfate deposits in around 534 ¬± 2, which is evidence of an extensive acidic dust veil. Possible explanations It has been conjectured that the changes were caused by ashes or dust thrown into the air after the eruption of a volcano (a phenomenon known as \\"volcanic winter\\"),Wohletz, Ken, Were the Dark Ages Triggered by Volcano-Related Climate Changes in the 6th Century? or after the impact of a comet or meteorite. The evidence of sulfate deposits in ice cores strongly supports the volcano hypothesis; the sulfate spike is even more intense than that which accompanied the lesser episode of climatic aberration in 1816, popularly known as the \\"Year Without a Summer\\", which has been connected to the explosion of the volcano Mount Tambora in Sumbawa. In 1984, R. B. Stothers postulated that the event might have been caused by the volcano Rabaul in what is now New Britain, near Papua New Guinea. In 1999, David Keys suggested that the volcano Krakatoa exploded at the time and caused the changes. It is suggested that an eruption of Krakatoa described as occurring in 416 by the Javanese Book of Kings actually took place in 535‚Äì536, there being no other evidence of such an eruption in 416. In 2009, Dallas Abbott of Columbia University's Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory in New York published evidence from Greenland ice cores that multiple comet impacts caused the haze. The spherules found in the ice might originate from terrestrial debris ejected into the atmosphere by an impact event. In 2010, Robert Dull, John Southon, and colleagues presented evidence suggesting a link between the Tierra Blanca Joven (TBJ) eruption of the Ilopango caldera in central El Salvador and the 536 event. Although earlier published radiocarbon evidence suggested a two-sigma age range of 408‚Äì536, which is consistent with the global climate downturn, the connection between 536 and Ilopango was not explicitly made until research on Central American Pacific margin marine sediment cores by Steffen Kutterolf and colleagues showed that the phreatoplinian TBJ eruption was much larger than previously thought. The radioactive carbon-14 in successive growth increments of a single tree that had been killed by a TBJ pyroclastic flow was measured in detail using accelerator mass spectrometry; the results supported the date of 535 as the year in which the tree died. A conservative bulk tephra volume for the TBJ event of ~84 km3 was calculated, indicating a large Volcanic Explosivity Index 6+ event and a magnitude of 6.9. The results suggest that the Ilopango TBJ eruption size, latitude, and age are consistent with the ice core sulphate records of Larsen et al. 2008. A 2015 study further supported the theory of a major eruption in \\"535 or early 536\\", with North American volcanoes considered a likely candidate. It also identified signals of a second eruption in 539‚Äì540, likely to have been in the tropics, which would have sustained the cooling effects of the first eruption through to around 550.. Archived copy In 2018, Harvard University researchers suggested the cause was a volcanic eruption in Iceland that erupted in early 536. However, the author of the previous study said to Science magazine that the evidence is insufficient to discard the North America hypothesis. Historic consequences The 536 event and ensuing famine have been suggested as an explanation for the deposition of hoards of gold by Scandinavian elites at the end of the Migration Period. The gold was possibly a sacrifice to appease the gods and get the sunlight back. Mythological events such as the Fimbulwinter and Ragnar√∂k are theorized to be based on the cultural memory of the event.Str√∂m, Folke: Nordisk Hedendom, Studentlitteratur, Lund 2005, (first published 1961) among others, refer to the climate change theory. The decline of Teotihuac√°n, a large city in Mesoamerica, is also associated with the droughts related to the climate changes, with signs of civil unrest and famines. A book written by David Keys speculates that the climate changes contributed to various developments, such as the emergence of the Plague of Justinian (541‚Äì549 AD), the decline of the Avars, the migration of Mongolian tribes towards the West, the end of the Sassanid Empire, the collapse of the Gupta Empire, the rise of Islam, the expansion of Turkic tribes, and the fall of Teotihuac√°n. In 2000, a 3BM Television production (for WNET and Channel Four) capitalized upon Keys' book. The documentary, under the name Catastrophe! How the World Changed, was broadcast in the US as part of PBS's Secrets of the Dead series. However, Keys and Wohletz' ideas lack mainstream acceptance. Reviewing Keys' book, British archaeologist Ken Dark commented that \\"much of the apparent evidence presented in the book is highly debatable, based on poor sources or simply incorrect. [...] Nonetheless, both the global scope and the emphasis on the 6th century AD as a time of wide-ranging change are notable, and the book contains some obscure information which will be new to many. However, it fails to demonstrate its central thesis and does not offer a convincing explanation for the many changes discussed\\".

Single malts are typically associated with single malt Scotch, though they are also produced in various other countries. Under the United Kingdom's Scotch Whisky Regulations, a \\"Single Malt Scotch Whisky\\" must be made exclusively from malted barley (although the addition of E150A caramel colouring is allowed), must be distilled using pot stills at a single distillery, and must be aged for at least three years in oak casks of a capacity not exceeding .The Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009, The National Archives, 2009.The Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009: Guidance for Producers and Bottlers , Scotch Whisky Association, February 12, 2009. While the Scotch model is usually copied internationally, these constraints may not apply to whisky marketed as \\"single malt\\" that is produced elsewhere. For example, there is no definition of the term \\"single\\" with relation to whisky in the law of the United States, and some American whiskey advertised as \\"single malt whisky\\" is produced from malted rye rather than malted barley.Old Potrero Single Malt Straight Rye Whiskey, Anchor Brewing Company. (Accessed December 2010.) Production All single malt goes through a similar batch production process, as outlined below. There are several types of single malts available from distilleries including single barrel single malts which are the product of a single batch that was stored for three or more years in a single oak barrel. These single barrel variants afford the opportunity for the consumer to see the influence of different types of storage on the same whisky (e.g., first use bourbon whiskey barrels, port pipes, etc.). The more common form of Single Malt is a marrying at bottling time of various batches that are mixed or vatted to achieve consistent flavours from one bottling run to the next. =Water= Water is first added to the barley to promote germination. At a later stage, prior to fermentation, it is mixed with ground barley grist to create a mash. Water is also used later in the production process to dilute most whisky before maturation and added once again before bottling. Most new- make malt whisky is diluted to about 60% alcohol by volume (ABV) or so before it is placed in casks to mature (62.5% is specified as a maximum in U.S. law for making straight whisky). The aged spirit is then diluted with water to reduce it to bottling strength (typically 40-50% ABV). Since large amounts of water are used during the process of whisky production, water supplies are a key factor for the location of any distillery. =Malting= Malting floor at Highland Park Distillery. Malted barley. Barley, yeast and water are the only ingredients required in the production of (barley-based) single malt whisky. The barley used to make the whisky is \\"malted\\" by soaking the grain in water for two to three days and allowing it to germinate. This process releases enzymes, which convert unfermentable starch (which is insoluble in water and not available for fermentation by yeast) to fermentable sugars. Traditionally in Scotland, each distillery had its own malting floor where the germinating seeds were regularly turned. The \\"pagoda roof\\" (many now false) which ventilated the malt kiln can still be seen at many distilleries both in Scotland and in other countries. However, most of the distilleries now use commercial \\"maltsters\\" to prepare their malt. =Drying in the kiln= The germination is halted (by heating) after three to five days, when the optimum amount of starch has been converted to fermentable sugars. The method for drying the germinated barley is by heating it with hot air. The distinctive \\"pagoda\\" chimney of a kiln at a distillery in Scotland. In most cases, some level of smoke from a peat-heated fire is introduced to the kiln to add phenols, a smoky aroma and flavour to the whisky. Some of the more intensely smoky malts have phenol levels between 25 and 50 parts per million (ppm). Islay malts have a reputation for being the peatiest. More subtle malts can have phenol levels of around 2-3 ppm. Entirely non-smoked (non-peated, unpeated) malts are made by the Glengoyne Distillery, which only uses hot air for drying. =Mashing= The malt is milled into a coarse flour (grist) which is made of three substances: (1) Husks (70%); (2) Grits (20%); and Flour (10%); to which three courses of hot water are added to extract the sugars. The extraction is done in a large kettle (usually made of stainless steel) called a mash tun. At first, the hot water dissolves the sugars (maltose) and enzymes (diastase) in the grist. Then the enzymes act on the starch left over from the malting stage, continuing the conversion to sugar, and producing a sugary liquid called wort. Typically, each batch of grist is mashed three times or so to extract all the fermentable sugars. The first water is injected at approximately 60 ¬∞C, the second portion at approximately 72 ¬∞C and the third and final portion at approximately 88 ¬∞C. The wort from the first two water courses is drained into \\"washback\\" vessels for further processing, whereas the third course is retained as the first charge in the next batch. =Fermentation= Yeast is used to ferment malted barley in washbacks. Yeast is added to the wort in a large vessel (often tens of thousands of litres) called a washback. Washbacks are commonly made of Oregon Pine or stainless steel. The yeast feeds on the sugars, and as a by-product, produces both carbon dioxide and alcohol. This process is called fermentation and can take up to three days to complete. When complete, the liquid has an alcohol content of 5 to 7% by volume, and is now known as wash. Up until this point the process has been quite similar to the production of beer. =Distillation= The wash, 5%‚Äì7% ethanol, is distilled in copper pot stills, boosting the alcohol content to 60%-80%. The wash is then distilled. The wash is heated, boiling off the alcohol, which has a lower boiling point than water; the vapour is collected and cooled to condense it back into a liquid form. Scottish regulations require single malts to be distilled in pot stills. In other jurisdictions, column stills may be used. The initial distilled spirit produced by a pot still, known as low wine has an alcohol content of about 20 to 40%. The low wines are then pumped into a second still, known as the spirit still, and distilled a second (and sometimes a third) time. The final spirit, called \\"new make spirit\\", generally has an alcohol content of 60 to 70%. =Dilution prior to aging= Most new-make malt whisky is diluted to about 62.5% a.b.v. before it is placed in casks to mature. =Maturation= The \\"new-make spirit\\", or unaged whisky, is then placed in oak casks to mature. By law, all Scotch whisky must be aged for a minimum of three years in oak casks, though many single malts are matured for much longer. The whisky continues to develop and change as it spends time in the wood, and maturation periods of twenty years or more are not uncommon. During the time it spends in the wood, a significant percentage of each cask's content will evaporate. The lost product is known as the angel's share. Reused casks The selection of casks can affect the character of the final whisky. Outside of the United States, the most common practice is to reuse casks that previously contained American whiskey, as US law requires several types of distilled spirits to be aged in new oak casks. To ensure continuity of supply of used oak casks some Scottish distilling groups own oak forests in the US and rent the new barrels to bourbon producers for first fill use. Bourbon casks impart a characteristic vanilla flavour to the whisky. Sherry casks are also commonly used. This practice arose because sherry used to be shipped to Britain from Spain in the cask rather than having been bottled, and the casks were expensive to return empty and were unwanted by the sherry cellars. In addition to imparting the flavours of their former contents, sherry casks lend maturing spirit a heavier body and a deep amber and sometimes reddish colour. Stainless steel shipping containers, however, have reduced the supply of wooden sherry casks, to the extent that the Macallan Distillery builds casks and leases them to the sherry cellars in Spain for a time, then has them shipped back to Scotland. Other casks used include those that formerly held port wine, madeira, rum or cognac. =Vatting, dilution and bottling= To be called a single malt whisky in Scotland, a bottle may only contain whisky distilled from malted barley and produced at a single distillery. The regulations of other countries may allow malted rye. If the bottle is the product of malt whiskies produced at more than one distillery, the whisky is called a blended malt or vatted malt, or pure malt. If a single malt is mixed with grain whisky, the result is a blended whisky. Single malts can be bottled by the distillery that produced them or by an independent bottler. The age statement on a bottle of single malt whisky is the age of the youngest malt in the mix, as commonly the whiskies of several years are mixed in a vat to create a more consistent house style. On occasion, the product of a single cask of whisky is bottled without being vatted with other casks, and released as a \\"Single Cask\\" offering. However, it is not always clear what the term \\"single cask\\" refers to. At least some producers release vattings of multiple barrels that have been matured together for one final period in a larger single cask as \\"single cask\\" whisky. While cask-strength, or undiluted, whisky (sometimes having an alcohol content upwards of 60%) has recently become popular, the vast majority of whisky is diluted to its \\"bottling strength\\" - between 40% and 46% ABV - and bottled for sale. =Chill filtration= Whisky can be \\"chill filtered\\": chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them. Most whiskies are bottled this way, unless specified as unchillfiltered or non chill filtered. Unchillfiltered whisky will often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal. This cloudy appearance is aesthetic only and does not negatively impact the spirit. Generally speaking, single malt whisky that is bottled at a proof =/> 46% ABV (92 proof) does not turn cloudy when cooled (other whiskies and spirits have differing thresholds). Most retail whiskies are bottled at or near 40% ABV for economic reasons, which has now become a modern custom, and therefore chill-filtering is common. Unchillfiltered, cask-strength whisky (usually > 60% ABV or 120 proof) is generally regarded as whisky in its purest form. Unlike wine, whisky does not continue to mature in the bottle. =Additives= E150A caramel colouring may be added to single malt Scotch whisky prior to bottling, to give the whisky a more rich and well-aged appearance. No other additives are allowed in Scotch whisky. This contrasts with the rules governing Canadian whisky production, which allows the addition of other flavourings as well as caramel, and with the rules governing American whiskey, which do not allow additives in \\"straight\\" whisky. The use of the caramel additive must be disclosed when the whisky is sold in some jurisdictions, although not in Scotland itself.Caramel (E150) or not, Whisky Magazine forum. (Accessed January 2011.)Caramel coloring discussion, Whisky Magazine forum. (Accessed January 2011.) History Distillation of whisky has been performed in Scotland and Ireland for centuries. The first written record of whisky comes from Ireland in 1405 in the Irish Annals of Clonmacnoise, where it was written that the head of a clan died after ‚Äútaking a surfeit of aqua vitae‚Äù at Christmas. The production of whisky from malted barley is first mentioned in Scotland in an entry on the 1494 Exchequer Rolls: \\"Eight bolls of malt to Friar John Cor, by order of the King, wherewith to make 'aqua vitae'\\".Kosar, Kevin R. (2010). Whiskey: A Global History. London: Reaktion Books. Single malt whisky is associated with the Scottish tradition, although there are also Irish single malts and others. Penderyn, the only whisky commercially produced in Wales, is also a single malt. From the 15th century onwards, whisky was heavily taxed in Scotland, to the point that most of the spirit was produced illegally. However, in 1823, Parliament passed an act making commercial distillation much more profitable, while imposing punishments on landowners when unlicensed distilleries were found on their properties. George Smith was the first person to take out a licence for a distillery under the new law, founding the Glenlivet Distillery in 1824. In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey refined a design originally created by Robert Stein for continuous stills which produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with the grain whisky distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended whisky proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the blended whisky was more popular on the international market. In recent times, single malt has made up about 26% of the whisky exported to other countries from Scotland; bulk spirits constituted about 5% and the balance has been blended whisky.A Comprehensive Yet Concise History of Scotch Whisky Single malt distilleries also exist in Argentina,http://whiskeyreviewer.com/2014/01/la- alazana-distillery-set-to-release-whiskey-in-2014_010214/ Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, England, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, USA, Wales and Norway.

Distilling and Maturing whisky via Malt Mileage Malt whisky ","title":"Single malt whisky"},{"id":"242431","text":"A blended whiskey (or blended whisky) is the product of blending different types of whiskeys and sometimes also neutral grain spirits, colorings, and flavorings. It is generally the product of mixing one or more higher-quality straight or single malt whiskey with less expensive spirits and other ingredients. This typically allows for a lower priced finished product, although expensive \\"premium\\" varieties also exist. Some examples of blended whiskey include Canadian Mist, Jameson Irish Whiskey, Seagram's Seven, Kessler Whiskey, Hibiki, and the various Scotch whisky blends sold under the Johnnie Walker brand.  Ingredients and uses  Higher proof spirits with less time aging are usually much less expensive to produce than straight whiskeys or single malt whiskeys and are often the primary spirits in blends, along with more premium whiskies and other ingredients added for flavoring. Most cocktails and mixed drinks that contain whiskey are made using economically priced blended whiskeys rather than higher priced whiskeys, primarily because the presence of the other ingredients makes the subtleties of the taste of the whiskey less critical to the overall taste of the drink. However, drink establishments often upsell the use of a premium top-shelf liquor in mixed drinks for better taste (and higher revenues).  Age statements  Most blended whiskeys do not list an age, although the regulations governing its production in some countries specify a minimum aging requirement. All spirits in a Canadian, Scottish, or Irish whiskey must be aged at least three years, and any age statement refers to the minimum age of the spirits used in the blend. In the United States, the age statement only refers to the minimum age of the straight whiskey ‚Äì which must comprise at least 20% of the content ‚Äì used within the blend. As neutral spirits are not considered whiskeys, they do not have to be aged at all for the production of U.S. blended whiskey.  Other regulations by country  = Canada = Most Canadian whiskies are blends. Any grain spirit aged for at least three years in Canada may be called Canadian whisky. Regulations do not specify any distillation limit, although in practice, it differs little from the Scottish and Irish limit of 94.8%, as the purity of neutral grain spirit has a practical limit of approximately that value. Whiskies with a lower distillation proof are also often included for flavor, with rye whisky being characteristically included. Canadian whisky may contain both caramel coloring and flavoring. = Ireland = Irish blended whiskey is defined by the Republic of Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as a blend of two or more different whiskey types among the pot still, malt, and grain whiskey categories. Its production usually includes Irish grain whiskey that is produced from a distillate that \\"is much less intense in flavor when compared to pot still distillates ... at a strength of c. 94.5% vol.\\" = Scotland = Under Scotch whisky regulations, \\"'Blended Malt Scotch Whisky' means a blend of two or more single malt Scotch whiskies that have been distilled at more than one distillery; 'Blended Grain Scotch Whisky' means a blend of two or more single grain Scotch whiskies that have been distilled at more than one distillery; and 'Blended Scotch Whisky' means a blend of one or more single malt Scotch whiskies with one or more single grain Scotch whiskies. The regulations also allow the addition of caramel color, regardless of whether the final product is labeled as blended or not.Scotch Whisky Regulations Guidance 2009 , Scotch Whisky Association, December 2, 2009. A mix of single malts only, without other types of whisky such as those made from grains other than malted barley, may be called a blended malt (formerly known as a vatted malt, a term no longer permitted). = United States = American \\"blended whiskey\\" ‚Äì alternatively labeled as \\"whiskey ‚Äì a blend\\" ‚Äì must contain a minimum of 20% straight whiskey. Blended whiskey that contains a minimum of 51% straight whiskey of one particular grain type (i.e., rye, malt, wheat, or bourbon whiskey) includes the grain type in its label description (e.g., \\"blended rye whiskey\\" or \\"blended bourbon whiskey\\"). Spirits containing less than 20% straight whiskey but greater than 5% whiskey of any kind can be labeled \\"spirit whiskey\\". American \\"blended whiskey\\" is not to be confused with American whiskey labeled as a \\"blend of straight whiskeys\\".

Fundamental idea The Myopic cultures, Levitt postulated, would pave the way for a business to fall, due to the short-sighted mindset and illusion that a firm is in a so-called 'growth industry'. This belief leads to complacency and a loss of sight of what customers want. It is said that these people focus more on the original product and refuse to adapt directly to the needs and wants of the consumer. To continue growing, companies must ascertain and act on their customers‚Äô needs and desires, not bank on the presumptive longevity of their products. In every case the reason growth is threatened, slowed or stopped is not because the market is saturated. It is because there has been a failure of management. Some commentators have suggested that its publication marked the beginning of the modern marketing movement. Its theme is that the vision of most organizations is too constricted by a narrow understanding of what business they are in. It exhorted CEOs to re-examine their corporate vision and redefine their markets in terms of wider perspectives. It was successful in its impact because it was, as with all of Levitt's work, essentially practical and pragmatic. Organizations found that they had been missing opportunities which were plain to see once they adopted the wider view. The paper was influential. The oil companies (which represented one of his main examples in the paper) redefined their business as energy rather than just petroleum. By contrast, when the Royal Dutch Shell embarked upon an investment program in nuclear power, it failed to demonstrate a more circumspect regard for their industry. One reason that shortsightedness is so common is that people feel they cannot accurately predict the future. While this is a legitimate concern, it is also possible to use a whole range of business prediction techniques currently available to estimate future circumstances as best as possible. There is no such a thing as a growth industry. There are only companies organized and operated to create and capitalize on growth opportunities. There are 4 conditions of the self- deceiving cycle: :# The belief that growth is assured by an expanding and more affluent population. :# The belief that there is no competitive substitute for the industry‚Äôs major product. :# Too much faith in mass production and in the advantages of rapidly declining unit costs as output rises. :# Preoccupation with a product that lends itself to carefully controlled scientific experimentation, improvement, and manufacturing cost reduction. Practical exercise There is a greater scope of opportunities as the industry changes. It trains managers to look beyond their current business activities and think \\"outside the box\\". George Steiner (1979) is one of many in a long line of admirers who cite Levitt's famous example on transportation. If a buggy whip manufacturer in 1910 defined its business as the \\"transportation starter business,\\" they might have been able to make the creative leap necessary to move into the automobile business when technological change demanded it. People who focus on marketing strategy, various predictive techniques, and the customer's lifetime value can rise above myopia to a certain extent. This can entail the use of long-term profit objectives (sometimes at the risk of sacrificing short term objectives). New marketing myopia The ‚Äúnew marketing myopia‚Äù occurs when marketers fail to see the broader societal context of business decision making, sometimes with disastrous results for their organization and society. It stems from three related phenomena: (1) a single-minded focus on the customer to the exclusion of other stakeholders, (2) an overly narrow definition of the customer and his or her needs, and (3) a failure to recognize the changed societal context of business that necessitates addressing multiple stakeholders. Customers in the ‚Äúnew marketing myopia‚Äù remain a central consideration, as in the traditional ‚Äúmarketing myopia‚Äù. However, academics that develop the ‚Äúnew marketing myopia‚Äù phenomenon state that it is essential to recognize that other stakeholders also require marketing attention. For business-to-consumer companies, these other stakeholders (e.g., employees) are sometimes customers too, but they need not be (e.g., nontarget market members of the firm's local community). Similar terms Kotler and Singh (1981) coined the term marketing hyperopia, by which they mean a better vision of distant issues than of near ones. Baughman (1974) uses the term marketing macropia meaning an overly broad view of your industry.

History Patrick Sarsfield was one of the senior commanders of James VII & II (deposed in 1688) in battles in Ireland with William of Orange which determined the latter's takeover with his co-regnant wife, Mary Stuart, of the English, Scottish and Irish thrones (the Glorious Revolution and First Jacobite Wars). In 1691, the deposed King James purportedly created him Earl of Lucan, Viscount of Tully and Baron Rosberry. Like all post deposition titles they have no recognition in UK law. In 1795, the first legal creation of title was for Sarsfield's similarly landowning great-nephew, Charles Bingham, 1st Baron Lucan.Lineage online linking William Sarsfield of Lucan to Charles Bingham The subsidiary titles associated with the Earldom of Lucan are: Baron Lucan, of Castlebar in the County of Mayo (created 1776), and Baron Bingham, of Melcombe Bingham in the County of Dorset (created 1934). The first is in the Peerage of Ireland, whereas the second is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which allowed Earls of Lucan to sit in the House of Lords after the practice of electing representative peers from Ireland ceased. The Earl of Lucan also has a Baronetcy (of Castlebar, Co Mayo), created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia (7 June 1634). The title became notorious when the 3rd Earl, as cavalry commander in the Crimean War, was involved in the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade. Its notoriety was renewed after the disappearance in 1974 of the profligate 7th Earl. In June 1975, in his absence, a coroner's jury found that he had murdered his children's nanny, Sandra Rivett. There have been no confirmed sightings of the 7th Earl since his disappearance, and he was declared legally dead for purposes of probate (debts and assets) in October 1999. This was, alone, insufficient to enable his son George, Lord Bingham to succeed to the titles ‚Äì a death certificate for the 7th Earl was issued in February 2016 under the Presumption of Death Act 2013, and Lord Bingham's claim to the Earldom was formally accepted by the House of Lords on 7 June 2016. The family seats were Castlebar House, near Gorteendrunagh, County Mayo, and from 1803 to 1922 Laleham House in Laleham, Surrey (until 1965 in the former county of Middlesex).In 1803, Richard Bingham, 2nd Earl of Lucan bought Laleham manor and manor house from William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale.

All of them are located in Asia Minor, present-day Turkey.  Description  According to Revelation 1:11, on the Greek island of Patmos, Jesus Christ instructs John of Patmos to: \\"Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamum, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.\\" The churches in this context refers to the community or local congregations of Christians living in each city.  The seven churches  The seven churches of Asia in stained glass in York Minster by John ThorntonThe seven churches are named for their locations. The Book of Revelation provides descriptions of each Church. * Ephesus (Revelation 2:1-7): known for having labored hard and not fainted, and separating themselves from the wicked; admonished for having forsaken its first love (2:4) * Smyrna (Revelation 2:8-11): admired for its tribulation and poverty; forecast to suffer persecution (2:10) * Pergamum (Revelation 2:12-17): located where 'Satan's seat' is; needs to repent of allowing false teachers (2:16) * Thyatira (Revelation 2:18-29): known for its charity, whose \\"latter works are greater than the former\\"; tolerates the teachings of a false prophetess (2:20) * Sardis (Revelation 3:1-6): admonished for - in contrast to its good reputation - being dead; cautioned to fortify itself and return to God through repentance (3:2-3) * Philadelphia (Revelation 3:7-13): known as steadfast in faith, keeping God's word and enduring patiently (3:10) * Laodicea, near Denizli (see Laodicean Church) (Revelation 3:14-22): called lukewarm and insipid (3:16) Seven messages The letters follow a common pattern. For example: the Lord first addresses each church and identifies Himself,2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 then defines things that He knows about the church in question.2:2-3, 9, 13, 19; 3:1, 8, 15-17 After this, a challenge or reproach is given,2:4-5, 10, 14-16, 20-25; 3:2-3, 9-11, 18-20 followed by a promise.2:7, 10-11, 17, 26-28; 3:4-5, 12, 20-21. In all seven cases the admonition is included, \\"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches\\",2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 although sometimes this comes before the promise and sometimes after. Although the letters differ in length in accord with the needs of each community, all conclude with an appeal to hold fast and to listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. Each church is promised that everyone who conquers will be rewarded by Christ. Some historicists typically interpret the seven churches as representing seven different periods in the history of the Western Church from the time of Paul until the return of Jesus Christ.Unger's Bible Dictionary (Chicago: Moody Press, 1975), p924 Scofield states that \\"these messages by their very terms go beyond the local assemblies mentioned.\\"Scofield, W. I., The Scofield Study Bible (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996) p1331 He is of the opinion that the letters have a prophetic purpose disclosing the seven phases of the spiritual history of the Church. Other writers, such as Clarence Larkin, Henry Hampton Halley,Halley, H. H., Halley's Bible Handbook (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1978), p688 Merrill Unger,Unger, M. F., Unger's Bible Dictionary (Chicago: Moody Press, 1975), p924 and William M. BranhamBranham, W. M., An Exposition of the Seven Church Ages (Jeffersonville, Indiana: Voice of God Recordings) 2005 also have posited the view that the seven churches preview the history of the global Church. Mosaic in St Mark's Basilica of the seven angels Historicism has been criticized by the Eastern Orthodox Fr. Dimitri Cozby, who writes that historicists take a greatly oversimplified view of church history: \\"Since dispensationalism is Protestant in origin its 'Church history' is strictly Western. The dispensations take into account almost nothing of Orthodox history after the period of the early councils which we share with the West.\\" Angels of the churches Chapters 2-3 of the Revelation have specific messages for each of the seven angels of the seven churches. The message of each of the seven letters is directed to the angel of the particular church that is mentioned. OrigenHom., xiii in Luc., and Hom., xx in Num. explains that these \\"angels\\" are the guardian angels of the churches, a view upheld by Henry Alford. But EpiphaniusH√¶r., xxv. explicitly rejects this view, and, in accordance with the imagery of the passage, explains it as the bishops. James L. Resseguie sees the angels of the churches as the heavenly reality, the spiritual condition of the church, the counterpart to the earthly reality.James L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John: A Narrative Commentary (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2009), 81. Similarly, Isbon T. Beckwith contends that the angels represent the invisible spiritual life of the church, its ‚Äúideal conception of its immanent spirit,‚ÄùIsbon T. Beckwith, The Apocalypse of John (NY: MacMillan Company, 1919; reprinted Wipf and Stock), 446, emphasis Beckwith‚Äôs. and Henry Barclay Swete refers to the angels as the ‚Äúprevailing spirit‚Äù of the church.Henry Barclay Swete, Commentary on Revelation: The Greek Text (1906, reprint Grand Rapids : Kregel Publications, 1977), 22. ‚ÄúThe angels are not human messengers or bishops of the church; rather, they are the heavenly counterparts to the empirical reality of the earthly church.‚ÄùResseguie, Revelation of John, 81; John P. Sweet, Revelation (Philadelphia: Trinity Press International, 1990), 73. John sees a vision of the Son of man, who walks among seven lampstands and has seven stars in his right hand. states that \\"The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.\\" The comparison of a teacher to a star is scriptural.Dan., xii, 3. Augustine of Hippo's reason for interpreting angels of the churches as the prelates of the church is that St. John speaks of them as falling from their first charity, which is not true of the angels.Ep., xliii (al. clxii), n. 22.Angels of the Churches, Catholic Encyclopedia Others would say that the falling away relates to the churches, not to the messengers, as each of the seven letters conclude with the words \\"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\\" The Amplified Bible states that Revelation 2:2 through to 3:18, ‚Äúyour‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äù are in the singular, referring to the angel of each church. Much of what is said is rebuke and admonishment, so if the angels are heavenly beings, they may serve in some way as representatives of the sinful people in their churches. Jewish tradition maintained that every nation and individual has a guardian angel, and that when God is about to punish a nation, He first punishes its angel. There is even a story of Michael, the guardian angel of Israel, being rebuked by God for the sins committed in the time of Ezekiel. So the original readers of Revelation might have assumed that the angels here are the guardian angels of the individual churches, sharing responsibility for the actions of the members. In the New Testament, the Greek word for angels (Œ¨Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ) is not only used for heavenly angels, but also used for human messengers, such as John the Baptist (,,) and God's prophets ()Merrill Unger, Unger's Bible Dictionary, (Chicago: Moody Press, 1975) p52 C.I. Scofield has noted that \\"The natural explanation of the 'messengers' is that they were men sent by the seven churches to ascertain the state of the aged apostle ... but they figure any who bear God's messages to a church.\\"Scofield, W.

The Congress met on 20 October 1820 in Troppau (modern Opava) in Austrian Silesia at the behest of Tsar Alexander I of Russia. Alexander and Francis I of Austria were present in person; King Frederick William III of Prussia was represented by the crown prince (afterward Frederick William IV). The three eastern powers were further represented by their foreign policy ministers: Austria by Prince Metternich, Russia by Count Capo d'lstria, and Prussia by Prince Hardenberg. Britain objected, on principle, to the suggested concerted action against the Neapolitan Liberals. Therefore, she sent no plenipotentiary, but was represented by Lord Stewart, ambassador in Vienna and the half-brother of the Foreign Secretary at the time, Viscount Castlereagh. France, too, had given no plenary powers to her representatives, though her policy was less clearly defined. Thus, from the very beginning of the Congress, it was clear that a division between the eastern and western powers was growing. The characteristic note of this congress was its intimate and informal nature; the determining fact at the outset was Metternich's discovery that he had no longer anything to fear from the \\"Jacobinism\\" of the emperor Alexander. In a three hours' conversation over a cup of tea at the little inn he had heard the tsar's confession and promise of amendment: \\"Aujourd'hui je deplore tout ce que j'ai dit et fait entre les annees 1814 et 1818 ... Dites-moi ce que vous voulez de moi. Je le ferai\\": Today I deplore everything that I have said and done between the years 1814 and 1818 ... Tell me what you want of me. I will do it. Metternich to Esterhazy, Oct. 24, 1820, F. O. Austria Dom. Sep.-Dec. 1820). Metternich's failure to convert Castlereagh to his views was now of secondary importance; the \\"free\\" powers being in accord, it was safe to ignore the opinions of Britain and France, whose governments, whatever their goodwill, were fettered by constitutional forms. In a series of conferences - to which the representatives of Britain and France were not admitted, on the excuse that they were only empowered to \\"report,\\" not to \\"decide\\" - was drawn up the famous preliminary protocol signed by Austria, Russia and Prussia on November 8. Troppau Protocol The main pronouncement of the \\"Troppau Protocol\\" is as follows: \\"States, which have undergone a change of government due to revolution, the result of which threaten other states, ipso facto cease to be members of the European Alliance, and remain excluded from it until their situation gives guarantees for legal order and stability. If, owing to such alterations, immediate danger threatens other states the powers bind themselves, by peaceful means, or if need be, by arms, to bring back the guilty state into the bosom of the Great Alliance.\\" No effort was made by the powers to give immediate effect to the principles enunciated in the protocol; and after it was officially announced the conferences were adjourned. It was decided to resume them at the Congress of Laibach the following January. The Protocol was greeted with dismay in England. While the English Government was reluctant to attack it openly, they found it difficult to answer the Opposition's claims that on a literal reading, Russia or Austria were entitled to invade England to oppose her supposed misgovernment of Ireland. \\"Shall we see a horde of Cossacks encamped in Hyde Park?\\" asked one Opposition MP.

His father, Henry, and uncle Thomas were official hangmen before him. Pierrepoint was born in Clayton in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His family struggled financially because of his father's intermittent employment and heavy drinking. Pierrepoint knew from an early age that he wanted to become a hangman, and was taken on as an assistant executioner in September 1932, aged 27. His first execution was in December that year, alongside his uncle Tom. In October 1941 he undertook his first hanging as lead executioner. During his tenure he hanged 200 people who had been convicted of war crimes in Germany and Austria, as well as several high-profile murderers‚Äîincluding Gordon Cummins (the Blackout Ripper), John Haigh (the Acid Bath Murderer) and John Christie (the Rillington Place Strangler). He undertook several contentious executions, including Timothy Evans, Derek Bentley and Ruth Ellis and executions for high treason‚ÄîWilliam Joyce (also known as Lord Haw-Haw) and John Amery‚Äîand treachery, with the hanging of Theodore Schurch. In 1956 Pierrepoint was involved in a dispute with a sheriff over payment, leading to his retirement from hanging. He ran a pub in Lancashire from the mid-1940s until the 1960s. He wrote his memoirs in 1974 in which he concluded that capital punishment was not a deterrent, although he may have changed his position after that. He approached his task with gravity and said that the execution was \\"sacred to me\\". His life has been included in several works of fiction, such as the 2005 film Pierrepoint, in which he was portrayed by Timothy Spall. Biography =Early life= Albert's father Henry Albert Pierrepoint was born on 30 March 1905 in Clayton in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the third of five children and eldest son of Henry Pierrepoint and his wife Mary (' Buxton). Henry had a series of jobs, including butcher's apprentice, clog maker and a carrier in a local mill, but employment was mostly short-term. With intermittent employment, the family often had financial problems, worsened by Henry's heavy drinking. From 1901 Henry had been on the list of official executioners. The role was part-time, with payment made only for individual hangings, rather than an annual stipend or salary, and there was no pension included with the position. Henry was removed from the list of executioners in July 1910 after arriving drunk at a prison the day before an execution and excessively berating his assistant. Henry's brother Thomas became an official executioner in 1906. Pierrepoint did not find out about his father's former job until 1916, when Henry's memoirs were published in a newspaper. Influenced by his father and uncle, when asked at school to write about what job he would like when older, Pierrepoint said that \\"When I leave school I should like to be public executioner like my dad is, because it needs a steady man with good hands like my dad and my Uncle Tom and I shall be the same\\". In 1917 the Pierrepoint family left Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and moved to Failsworth, near Oldham, Lancashire. Henry's health declined and he was unable to undertake physical work; as a result, Pierrepoint left school and began work at the local Marlborough Mills. Henry died in 1922 and Pierrepoint received two blue exercise books‚Äîin which his father had written his story as a hangman‚Äîand Henry's execution diary, which listed details of each hanging in which he had participated. In the 1920s Pierrepoint left the mill and became a drayman for a wholesale grocer, delivering goods ordered through a travelling salesman. By 1930 he had learned to drive a car and a lorry to make his deliveries; he later became manager of the business. =As assistant executioner, 1931‚Äì1940= Wandsworth Prison museum On 19 April 1931 Pierrepoint wrote to the Prison Commissioners and applied to be an assistant executioner. He was turned down as there were no vacancies, but received an invitation for interview six months later. He was accepted and spent four days training at Pentonville Prison, London, where a dummy was used for practice. He received his formal acceptance letter as an assistant executioner at the end of September 1932. At that time, the assistant's fee was ¬£1-11-6d per execution, with another ¬£1-11-6d paid two weeks later if his conduct and behaviour were satisfactory. The executioner was chosen by the county high sheriff‚Äîor more commonly delegated to the undersheriff, who selected both the hangman and the assistant. Executioners and their assistants were required to be discreet and the rules for those roles included the clause: > He should clearly understand that his conduct and general behaviour should > be respectable, not only at the place and time of the execution, but before > and subsequently, that he should avoid attracting public attention in going > to or from the prison, and he is prohibited from giving to any person > particulars on the subject of his duty for publication. Execution Box number eight, containing all the equipment needed for an executioner; shown at Wandsworth Prison museum In late December 1932 Pierrepoint undertook his first execution. His uncle Tom had been contracted by the government of the Irish Free State for the hanging of Patrick McDermott, a young Irish farmer who had murdered his brother; Tom was free to select his own assistant as it was outside Britain, and took Pierrepoint with him. They travelled to the Mountjoy Prison, Dublin for the hanging. It was scheduled for 8:00 am, and took less than a minute to perform. Pierrepoint's job as assistant was to follow the prisoner onto the scaffold, bind the prisoner's legs together, then step back off the trapdoor before the lead executioner sprung the mechanism. For the remainder of the 1930s Pierrepoint worked in the grocery business and as an assistant executioner. Most of his commissions were with his uncle Tom, from whom Pierrepoint learned much. He was particularly impressed with his uncle's approach and demeanour, which were dignified and discreet; he also followed Tom's advice \\"if you can't do it without whisky, don't do it at all.\\" In July 1940 Pierrepoint was the assistant at the execution of Udham Singh, a Punjabi refugee who had been convicted of shooting the colonial administrator Sir Michael O'Dwyer. The day before the execution, Stanley Cross, the newly promoted lead executioner, became confused with his calculations of the drop length, and Pierrepoint stepped in to advise on the correct measurements; Pierrepoint was added to the list of head executioners soon after. =As lead executioner, 1940‚Äì1956= In October 1941 Pierrepoint undertook his first execution as lead executioner when he hanged the gangland killer Antonio \\"Babe\\" Mancini. He followed the routine as established by Home Office guidelines, and as followed by his predecessors. He and his assistant arrived the day before the execution, where he was told the height and weight of the prisoner; he viewed the condemned man through the \\"Judas hole\\" in the door to judge his build. Pierrepoint then went to the execution room‚Äînormally next to the condemned cell‚Äîwhere he tested the equipment using a sack that weighed about the same as the prisoner; he calculated the length of the drop using the Home Office Table of Drops, making allowances for the man's physique, if necessary. He left the weighted sack hanging on the rope to ensure the rope was stretched and it would be re- adjusted in the morning if necessary. X-ray of the cervical spine with a Hangman's fracture. Left without annotation, right with. The C2 (red outline) is moved forward with respect to C3 (blue outline). On the day of the execution, the practice was for Pierrepoint, his assistant and two prison officers to enter the condemned man's cell at 8:00 am. Pierrepoint secured the man's arms behind his back with a leather strap, and all five walked through a second door, which led to the execution chamber. The prisoner was walked to a marked spot on the trapdoor whereupon Pierrepoint placed a white hood over the prisoner's head and a noose around his neck. The metal eye through which the rope was looped was placed under the left jawbone which, when the prisoner dropped, forced the head back and broke the spine. Pierrepoint pushed a large lever, releasing the trapdoor. From entering the condemned man's cell to opening the trapdoor took him a maximum of 12 seconds. The neck was broken in almost exactly the same position in each hanging‚Äîthe Hangman's fracture. War-related executions During the Second World War Pierrepoint hanged 15 German spies, as well as US servicemen found guilty by courts martial of committing capital crimes in England. In December 1941, he executed the German spy Karel Richter at Wandsworth prison. When Pierrepoint entered the condemned man's cell for the hanging, Richter stood up, threw aside one of the guards and charged headfirst at the stone wall. Stunned momentarily, he rose and shook his head. After Richter struggled with the guards, Pierrepoint managed to get the leather strap around Richter's wrists. He burst the leather strap from eye-hole to eye-hole and was free again. After another struggle, the strap was wrapped tightly around his wrists. He was brought to the scaffold where a strap was wrapped around his ankles, followed by a cap and noose. Just as Pierrepoint pushed the lever, Richter jumped up with bound feet. As Richter plummeted through the trapdoor, Pierrepoint could see that the noose had slipped, but it became stuck under Richter's nose. Despite the unusual position of the noose, the prison medical officer determined that it was an instantaneous, clean death. Writing about the execution in his memoirs, Pierrepoint called it \\"my toughest session on the scaffold during all my career as an executioner\\". The broken strap was given to Pierrepoint as a souvenir; he used it occasionally for what he thought were meaningful executions. In August 1943 Pierrepoint married Anne Fletcher after a courtship of five years. He did not tell her about his role of executioner until a few weeks after the nuptials, when he was flown to Gibraltar to hang two saboteurs; on his return he explained the reason for his absence and she accepted it, saying that she had known about his second job all along, after hearing gossip locally. Irma Grese and Josef Kramer, both officials at Bergen- Belsen concentration camp, awaiting trial; both were executed by Pierrepoint. In late 1945, following the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and the subsequent trial of the camp's officials and functionaries, Pierrepoint was sent to Hamelin, Germany to carry out the executions of eleven of those sentenced to death, plus two other German war criminals convicted of murdering an RAF pilot in the Netherlands in March 1945. He disliked any publicity connected to his role and was unhappy that his name had been announced to the press by General Sir Bernard Montgomery. When he flew to Germany, he was followed across the airfield by the press, which he described as being \\"as unwelcome as a lynch mob\\". He was given the honorary military rank of lieutenant colonel and, on 13 December, he first executed the women individually, then the men two at a time. Pierrepoint travelled several times to Hamelin, and between December 1948 and October 1949 he executed 226 people, often over 10 a day, and on several occasions groups of up to 17 over 2 days. Two of those convicted of treason and hanged by Pierrepoint, John Amery (left) and William Joyce (right) Six days after the Belsen hangings in December 1945, Pierrepoint hanged John Amery at Wandsworth prison. Amery, the eldest son of the cabinet minister Leo Amery, was a Nazi sympathiser who had visited prisoner-of-war camps in Germany to recruit allied prisoners for the British Free Corps; he had also broadcast to Britain to encourage men to join the Nazis. He was found guilty of treason. On 3 January 1946 Pierrepoint hanged William Joyce, also known as Lord Haw-Haw, who had been given the death sentence for high treason, although it was questionable if he were a British citizen, and therefore subject to the charge. The following day Pierrepoint hanged Theodore Schurch, a British soldier who had been found guilty under the Treachery Act 1940. Joyce was the last person to be executed in Britain for treason; the death penalty for treason was abolished with the introduction of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Schurch was the last person to be hanged in Britain for treachery, and the last to be hanged for any offence other than murder. In September 1946 Pierrepoint travelled to Graz, Austria, to train staff at Karlau Prison in the British form of long-drop hanging. Previously, the Austrians had used a shorter drop, leaving the executed men to choke to death, rather than the faster long-drop kill. He undertook four double executions of prisoners, with his trainees acting as assistants. Despite Pierrepoint's expertise as an executioner and his experience with hanging the German war criminals at Hamelin, he was not selected as the hangman to carry out the sentences handed down at the Nuremberg trials; the job went to an American, Master Sergeant John C. Woods, who was relatively inexperienced. The press was invited to observe the process, and pictures were later circulated which suggested the hangings had been poorly done. Wilhelm Keitel took 20 minutes to die after the trapdoor opened; the trap was not wide enough, so that some of the men hit the edges as they fell‚Äîmore than one person's nose was torn off in the process‚Äîand others were strangled, rather than having their necks broken. Post-war executions After the war, Pierrepoint left the delivery business, and took over the lease of a pub, the Help the Poor Struggler on Manchester Road, in the Hollinwood area of Oldham. In the 1950s he left the pub and took a lease of the larger Rose and Crown at Much Hoole near Preston, Lancashire. He later said that he changed his main occupation because: > I wanted to run my own business so that I should be under no obligation when > I took time off. ... I could take a three o'clock plane from Dublin after > conducting an execution there and be opening my bar without comment at half > past five. Sir Ernest Gowers in 1920; Gowers was the chairman of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment In 1948 Parliament debated a new Criminal Justice Bill, which raised the question of whether to continue with the death penalty or not. While the debates were proceeding, no executions took place, and Pierrepoint worked solely in his pub. When the bill failed in the House of Lords, hangings resumed after a nine-month gap. The following year, the Home Secretary, Chuter Ede, set up a Royal Commission to look into capital punishment in the UK. Pierrepoint gave evidence in November 1950 and included a mock hanging at Wandsworth prison for the commission members. The commission's report was published in 1953 and resulted in the Homicide Act 1957 which reduced the grounds for execution by differentiating between capital and non-capital charges for homicide. From the late 1940s and into the 1950s Pierrepoint, Britain's most experienced executioner, carried out several more hangings, including those of prisoners described by his biographer, Brian Bailey, as \\"the most notorious murderers of the period ... [and] three of the most controversial executions in the latter years of the death penalty.\\" In August 1949 he hanged John Haigh, nicknamed \\"the Acid Bath Murderer\\", as he had dissolved the bodies of his victims in sulphuric acid; Haigh admitted to nine murders, and tried to avoid hanging by saying he drank the blood of his victims and claiming insanity. The following year Pierrepoint hanged James Corbitt, one of the regular customers at Pierrepoint's pub; the two had sung duets together and while Pierrepoint called Corbitt \\"Tish\\", Corbitt returned the nickname \\"Tosh\\". In his autobiography, Pierrepoint considered the matter: > As I polished the glasses, I thought if any man had a deterrent to murder > poised before him, it was this troubadour whom I called Tish, coming to > terms with his obsessions in the singing room of Help The Poor Struggler. He > was not only aware of the rope, he had the man who handled it beside him, > singing a duet. ... The deterrent did not work. He killed the thing he > loved. In March 1950 Pierrepoint hanged Timothy Evans, a 25-year-old man who had the vocabulary of a 14-year-old and the mental age of a ten-year-old. Evans was arrested for the murder of his wife and daughter at their home, the top floor flat of 10 Rillington Place, London. His statements to the police were contradictory, telling them that he killed her, and also that he was innocent. He was tried and convicted for the murder of his daughter. Three years later Evans's landlord, John Christie, was arrested for the murder of several women, whose bodies he hid in the house. He subsequently admitted to the murder of Evans's wife, but not the daughter. Pierrepoint hanged him in July 1953 in Pentonville Prison, but the case showed Evans's conviction and hanging had been a miscarriage of justice. The matter led to further questions on the use of the death penalty in Britain. In the months before he hanged Christie, Pierrepoint undertook another controversial execution, that of Derek Bentley, a 19-year-old man who had been an accomplice of Christopher Craig, a 16-year- old boy who shot and killed a policeman. Bentley was described in his trial as: > a youth of low intelligence, shown by testing to be just above the level of > a feeble-minded person, illiterate, unable to read or write, and when tested > in a way which did not involve scholastic knowledge shown to have a mental > age between 11 and 12 years. The outside of the pub where Ruth Ellis shot her lover: the bullet holes are visible in the wall At the time the policeman was shot, Bentley had been under arrest for 15 minutes, and the words he said to Craig‚Äî\\"Let him have it, Chris\\"‚Äîcould either have been taken for an incitement to shoot, or for Craig to hand his gun over (one policeman had asked him to hand the gun over just beforehand). Bentley was found guilty by the English law principle of joint enterprise. Pierrepoint hanged Ruth Ellis for murder in July 1955. Ellis was in an abusive relationship with David Blakely, a racing driver; she shot him four times after what her biographer, Jane Dunn, called \\"three days of sleeplessness, panic, and pathological jealousy, fuelled by quantities of Pernod and a reckless consumption of tranquillizers\\". The case attracted great interest from the press and public. The matter was discussed in Cabinet and a petition of 50,000 signatures was sent to the Home Secretary, Gwilym Lloyd George, to ask for a reprieve; he refused to grant one. Ellis was the last woman to be hanged in Britain. Two weeks after Ellis's execution, Pierrepoint hanged Norman Green, who had confessed to killing two boys in his home town of Wigan; it was Pierrepoint's last execution. =Retirement and later life= In early January 1956 Pierrepoint travelled to Manchester for another execution and paid for staff to cover the bar in his absence. He spent the afternoon in the prison calculating the drop and setting up the rope to the right length. That evening the prisoner was given a reprieve. Pierrepoint left the prison and, because of heavy snow, stayed overnight in a local hotel before returning home. Two weeks later he received from the instructing sheriff a cheque for his travelling expenses, but not his execution fee. He wrote to the Prison Commissioners to point out that he had received a full fee in other cases of reprieve, and that he had spent additional money in employing bar staff. The Commissioners advised he speak to the instructing sheriff, as it was his responsibility, not theirs; they also reminded him that his conditions of employment were that he was paid only for the execution, not in the case of a reprieve. Shortly afterwards he received a letter from the sheriff offering ¬£4 as a compromise. On 23 February he replied to the Prison Commissioners and informed them that he was resigning with immediate effect, and requested that his name be taken from the list of executioners. There were soon rumours in the press that his resignation was connected with the hanging of Ellis. In his autobiography he denied this was the case: > At the execution of Ruth Ellis no untoward incident happened which in any > way appalled me or anyone else, and the execution had absolutely no > connection with my resignation seven months later. Nor did I leave the list, > as one newspaper said, by being arbitrarily taken off it, to shut my mouth, > because I was about to reveal the last words of Ruth Ellis. She never spoke. Pierrepoint's autobiography does not give any reasons for his resignation‚Äîhe states that the Prison Commissioners asked him to keep the details private. The Home Office contacted the Sheriff of Lancashire, who paid Pierrepoint the full fee of ¬£15 for his services, but he was adamant that he was still retiring. He had received an offer for ¬£30,000 to ¬£40,000 from the Empire News and Sunday Chronicle to publish weekly stories about his experiences. The Home Office considered prosecuting him under the Official Secrets Act 1939, but when two of the stories appeared that contained information that contradicted the recollections of other witnesses, they did not do so. Instead pressure was put on the publishers, who stopped the stories. Wandsworth Prison museum Pierrepoint and his wife ran their pub until they retired to the seaside town of Southport in the 1960s. In 1974 he published his autobiography, Executioner: Pierrepoint. He died on 10 July 1992, aged 87, in the nursing home where he had lived for the last four years of his life. Views on capital punishment In his 1974 autobiography, Pierrepoint changed his view on capital punishment, and wrote that hanging: > ... is said to be a deterrent. I cannot agree. There have been murders since > the beginning of time, and we shall go on looking for deterrents until the > end of time. If death were a deterrent, I might be expected to know. It is I > who have faced them last, young lads and girls, working men, grandmothers. I > have been amazed to see the courage with which they take that walk into the > unknown. It did not deter them then, and it had not deterred them when they > committed what they were convicted for. All the men and women whom I have > faced at that final moment convince me that in what I have done I have not > prevented a single murder. In a 1976 interview with BBC Radio Merseyside, Pierrepoint expressed his uncertainty towards the sentiments, and said that when the autobiography was originally written, \\"there was not a lot of crime. Not like there is today. I am now honestly on a balance and I don‚Äôt know which way to think because it changes every day.\\" Pierrepoint's position as an opponent of capital punishment was questioned by his long-time former assistant, Syd Dernley, in his 1989 autobiography, The Hangman's Tale: > Even the great Pierrepoint developed some strange ideas in the end. I do not > think I will ever get over the shock of reading in his autobiography, many > years ago, that like the Victorian executioner James Berry before him, he > had turned against capital punishment and now believed that none of the > executions he had carried out had achieved anything! This from the man who > proudly told me that he had done more jobs than any other executioner in > English history. I just could not believe it. When you have hanged more than > 680 people, it's a hell of a time to find out you do not believe capital > punishment achieves anything! Approach and legacy Pierrepoint described his approach to hanging in his autobiography. He did so in what Lizzie Seal, a reader in Criminology, calls \\"quasi-religious language\\", including the phrase that a \\"higher power\\" selected him as an executioner. When asked by the Royal Commission about his role, he replied that \\"It is sacred to me\\". In his autobiography, Pierrepoint describes his ethos thus: > I have gone on record ... as saying that my job is sacred to me. That > sanctity must be most apparent at the hour of death. A condemned prisoner is > entrusted to me, after decisions have been made which I cannot alter. He is > a man, she is a woman, who, the church says, still merits some mercy. The > supreme mercy I can extend to them is to give them and sustain in them their > dignity in dying and death. The gentleness must remain. Brian Bailey highlights Pierrepoint's phrasing relating to hangings; the autobiography reads \\"I had to hang Derek Bentley\\", \\"I had to execute John Christie\\" and \\"I had to execute Mrs Louisa Merrifield\\". Bailey comments that Pierrepoint \\"never had to hang anybody\\". The exact number of people executed by Pierrepoint has never been established. Bailey, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and Leonora Klein, one of his biographers, state it was over 400; Steven Fielding, another biographer, puts the figure at 435‚Äîbased on the Prison Execution Books held at The National Archives; the obituarists of The Times and The Guardian put the figure at 17 women and 433 men. The Irish Times puts the figure at 530 people, The Independent considers the figure to be 530 men and 20 women, while the BBC states it is \\"up to 600\\" people. In addition to his 1974 autobiography, Pierrepoint has been the subject of several biographies, either focusing on him, or alongside other executioners. These include Pierrepoint: A Family of Executioners by Fielding, published in 2006, and Leonora Klein's 2006 book A Very English Hangman: The Life and Times of Albert Pierrepoint. There have been several television and radio documentaries about or including Pierrepoint, and he has been portrayed on stage and screen, and in literature. On Pierrepoint's resignation, two assistant executioners were promoted to lead executioner: Jock Stewart and Harry Allen. Over the next seven years they carried out the remaining thirty- four executions in the UK. On 13 August 1964 Allen hanged Gwynne Evans at Strangeways Prison in Manchester for the murder of John Alan West; at the same time, Stewart hanged Evans's accomplice, Peter Allen, at Walton Gaol in Liverpool. They were the last hangings in English legal history. The following year the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 was passed, which imposed a five-year moratorium on executions. The temporary ban was made permanent on 18 December 1969.

Opava is one of the historical centres of Silesia. It was a historical capital of Czech Silesia. Opava is now in the Moravian-Silesian Region and has a population of more than 55,000. Geography Opava is located on the Opava Hilly Land (; a part of the Silesian Lowlands) on the Opava River (left tributary of the Oder River) and Moravice River (right tributary of the Opava River). History Opava was first documented in 1195. The first mention of Magdeburg city rights came from 1224. It was capital of the Silesian, Bohemian and finally Austrian Duchy of Opava. In 1614 Karl I of Liechtenstein became Duke of Opava. After the majority of Silesia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the War of the Austrian Succession after 1740, the remaining Silesian territory still under the control of the Habsburg Monarchy became known as Austrian Silesia, with its capital in Troppau (1742‚Äì1918). The Congress of Troppau took place there in the period 27 October ‚Äì 17 December 1820.Chronologie des civilisations, Jean Delorme, Presses universitaires de France, 1956 Austrian KK 10 kreuzer stamp issue 1863, cancelled Troppau According to the Austrian census of 1910, the town had 30,762 inhabitants, 29,587 of whom had permanent residence there. The census asked people for their native language, which showed that 27,240 (92%) were German-speaking, 2,039 (6.9%) were Czech- speaking and 274 (0.9%) were Polish-speaking. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish, and most of them thus declared German as their native language. The main religious group was Roman Catholics with 28,379 (92.2%), followed by Protestants with 1,155 (3.7%) and Jews with 1,112 (3.6%).Ludwig Patryn (ed): Die Ergebnisse der Volksz√§hlung vom 31. Dezember 1910 in Schlesien, Troppau 1912. After the defeat of Austria-Hungary in World War I, Troppau became part of Czechoslovakia in 1919 as Opava. Opava in 1900 From 1938‚Äì45 Opava was part of Nazi Germany according to the Munich agreement. Already a day before Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938, the town seceded from its okres and became its own Stadtkreis. After the end of World War II, the entire German population of Opava was forcibly expelled in 1945‚Äì46 under terms included in the Bene≈° decrees; the city was resettled with Czechs. Many of the expelled population settled in Bamberg, Germany. While the Duchy of Opava has ceased to exist, the title of Duke of Troppau continues, with Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein being the current incumbent. Economy and culture Opava is currently an important business and cultural center of Opavian Silesia.Opavian Silesia It is the location of several economic and cultural institutions serving the entire region, including the Silesian Museum which is the oldest Museum in the Czech Republic,About Silesian Land's Museum (in czech) ‚Äì \\"Slezsk√© zemsk√© muzeum je nejstar≈°√≠ muzeum v ƒåesk√© republice.

Opava is home to the only public university in the country not situated in a regional capital, the Silesian University (Opava). The city is part of a congested industrial area along with Ostrava and produces mining equipment. Opava also awards its own Cultural Prize. The Silesian Theatre in Opava was founded in 1805.

A chess prodigy, he was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 2000, at the age of 16. McShane has become one of England's leading players and a member of the national team. He also works as a trader in London's financial sector, and has been described as the world's strongest amateur chess player.Luke McShane player profile chess24.com  Early career  Luke McShane, 1992 at Duisburg McShane won the World Under 10 Championship in Duisburg at the age of eight. Shortly afterwards he found a sponsor in the form of computer company Psion and played Garry Kasparov at a simultaneous exhibition in 1995. At sixteen he became the youngest ever Briton to achieve the title Grandmaster, gaining the three results required (\\"norms\\") in tournaments in Germany, Iceland and the Politiken Cup in Copenhagen, Denmark. He held the record until David Howell broke it in January 2007. In January 2004 McShane was ranked second in the world among junior (under 21) players behind Teimour Radjabov.  Grandmaster  Among McShane's more notable results are joint first in the 1998 Bunratty Masters in Ireland with John Nunn, winning five of his six games, and joint winner with Stuart Conquest and Bogdan Laliƒá of the Iona Technologies International Masters in Kilkenny. McShane led the 2002 British Championship in Torquay, and was in a good position in the final round before blundering and losing to the tournament's winner, Ramachandran Ramesh. McShane finished tied for fourth. From around 2002, McShane has been facing stiffer opposition, including players from the world's top ten. He played for England in the Chess Olympiad in Bled, scoring 6¬Ω/11 points, and won the silver medal at the World Junior Championship in Goa.

In 2009 and 2010 McShane participated in the London Chess Classic. He finished mid-table at the tournament's inaugural showing and took the best game prize for his win against Hikaru Nakamura. The 2010 tournament included Viswanathan Anand (reigning world chess champion), Magnus Carlsen (rated number one for most of 2010) and Vladimir Kramnik (former world champion). Under a scoring system of 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss, McShane finished joint second with Anand, behind Carlsen, whom McShane had beaten in their individual encounter, and ahead of Kramnik. Undefeated, his event performance rating was 2838 ‚Äì higher than Carlsen's or Anand's. In the January 2011 rating list, he briefly topped Nigel Short to become the UK's second highest ranked player after Michael Adams.

McShane participated in the Tal Memorial in Moscow in June 2012. Seeded in last place, he beat Levon Aronian, then the world ranked number two, in a game where he sacrificed the exchange for the initiative. He then followed up with wins against Alexander Morozevich and Vladimir Kramnik, his combative performances rewarding voters of the online poll responsible for securing his wildcard place, ahead of Alexei Shirov and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. However, he finished last but one (tied eighth), after losing to Magnus Carlsen, Fabiano Caruana, Teimour Radjabov and Alexander Grischuk. McShane was particularly active in the USA during 2015. In June, he won the (Arlington) DC International with 7/9. The following month, he finished the World Open on 6¬Ω/9, a half-point behind the leading group.

In 2010, Planer returned to the role of the Narrator in the UK Tour of The Rocky Horror Show, playing in Cambridge and Northampton, before also reprising the role of Wilbur in Manchester and Leeds. He also featured in Doctor Who: Live touring the UK, as Vorgenson The Inter-Galactic Showman, before appearing in Pantomime as Captain Hook at the Lyceum Theatre in Sheffield. Planer went on to star as Grandpa Joe in the original production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which opened in London's West End in 2013. From September 2018 to November 2018, Planer toured with Ade Edmondson in a play that they wrote together called Vulcan 7. =Film= Planer has appeared in films, including Flood, Virgin Territory, Bright Young Things, Hogfather, The Colour of Magic, The Wind in the Willows, The Land Girls, Clockwork Mice, Carry on Columbus, Brazil, The Supergrass, I Give It a Year, The Apple Picker and Yellowbeard. =Music= Planer played Den Dennis, one of the four members of the 1980s spoof rock band Bad News, which made two albums produced by Brian May. The band performed at the Hammersmith Apollo as well as the Donington and Reading Rock Festivals. As Neil from The Young Ones, Planer gained a number two hit single in 1984 in the form of \\"Hole in My Shoe\\" (originally a hit for 1960s band Traffic). A cover of Tomorrow's \\"My White Bicycle\\" was a less successful follow up, only reaching No.97 in the charts. After that, an album was produced, entitled Neil's Heavy Concept Album. Planer also took Neil's stage act on the road in that year as Neil in the \\"Bad Karma in The UK\\" tour. This culminated in a month-long run at St. Mary's Hall at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The Young Ones also appeared on Cliff Richard's 1986 charity rerecording of \\"Living Doll\\", which spent three weeks at number one in the UK. He has a silver and a gold disc and has a Brit award from his musical career. In 2015 he started a new music project called Rainsmoke with Chris Wade (Dodson and Fogg) and Roger Planer. In 2017 he recorded two songs for the album Wit & Whimsy - Songs by Alexander S. Bermange (one solo and one featuring all of the album's 23 artists), which reached No. 1 in the iTunes comedy album chart. =Voice acting= Planer is the main reader for the audiobook editions of many of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels.

Straw served in the Cabinet from 1997 to 2010 under the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He held two of the traditional Great Offices of State, as Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and the Secretary of State for Justice throughout the Brown ministry. Straw is one of only three individuals to have served in Cabinet continuously during the Labour governments from 1997 to 2010, the others being Brown and Alistair Darling. After the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, Straw briefly served as Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and Shadow Justice Secretary, with the intention to stand down from the frontbench after the subsequent 2010 Labour Shadow Cabinet election. Early life Jack Straw was born in Buckhurst Hill in Essex, the son of (Walter) Arthur Whitaker Straw ‚Äì an insurance clerk and salesman and former industrial chemist born at Worsbrough near Barnsley, and raised in Woodford Green ‚Äì and Joan Sylvia Gilbey, a teacher at the independent Oaklands School, whose father was a Loughton bus mechanic and shop steward, and who was distantly related to the gin-making family.Who's Who 2008, A & C Black, 2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007Last Man Standing: Memoirs of a Political Survivor, Jack Straw, 2012General Register Office Birth Index 1946 Q3 Epping 5a 178 After his father (with whom, by the time of his death, Straw and his siblings were reconciled) left the family, Straw was brought up by his mother on a council estate in Loughton. Known to his family as John, he started calling himself Jack while in school, in reference to Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Straw is of 1/8th Jewish descent (his maternal grandfather's mother came from an Eastern European Jewish family). He himself is a Christian.How Jewish is Jack Straw? The Jewish Chronicle, 31 July 2008 Straw was educated at the school at which his mother taught, Oaklands, and when she left there, at Staples Road Primary School, Loughton, then Brentwood School and the University of Leeds. He graduated with a 2:2 degree in Law. He was alleged by the Foreign Office to have disrupted a student trip to Chile to build a youth centre. They branded him a \\"troublemaker acting with malice aforethought\\". In 1966, he was elected as chairman of Leeds University Union Labour Society by a majority consisting largely of members of the Leeds University Union Communist Society who had joined Labour Society immediately before the Annual General Meeting. Led by Straw, Labour Society disaffiliated itself from the Labour Party and changed its name to the Leeds University Union Socialist Society. Straw was then elected president of the Leeds University Union, during which time he reluctantly supported a sit-in lasting four days in June 1968. At the 1967 National Union of Students (NUS) Conference, he unsuccessfully ran for office in the NUS. In April 1968 he stood unsuccessfully for election as NUS President, but was defeated by Trevor Fisk.Sir Patrick Wall, Student Power (London: Conservative Monday Club, 1969), p. 8 However, he was elected as NUS President in 1969, holding this post until 1971. In 1971, he was elected as a Labour councillor in the London Borough of Islington, a position he held until 1978. Straw qualified as a barrister at Inns of Court School of Law, practising criminal law for two years from 1972 to 1974. He is a member of The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and remains active in lecturing to fellow members and students. Between 1971 and 1974, Jack Straw was a member of the Inner London Education Authority, and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. He served as a political adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security from 1974 to 1976, and as an adviser to Peter Shore at the Department for the Environment from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the Granada TV series World in Action. Straw stood unsuccessfully as the Labour parliamentary candidate for the safe Conservative Tonbridge and Malling constituency in the February 1974 election. He was later selected to stand for Labour in its safe Blackburn seat at the 1979 General Election. A motion of Leeds University Union Council in 2000 revoked Jack Straw's life membership of the Union and removed his name from the Presidents' Board, citing his support for \\"the asylum and immigration bill\\" and for limits to trial by jury and legal aid. In 2007, the Union Council reinstated his life membership and place on the Presidents' Board. Member of Parliament from 1979 to 2015 Straw was selected to stand for Parliament for the Lancashire constituency of Blackburn in 1977, after Barbara Castle decided not to seek re-election there. He won the seat in 1979. On 25 October 2013 he announced that he would stand down as an MP at the next election. =Shadow Cabinet (1987‚Äì1997)= Straw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as Shadow Education Secretary from 1987 to 1992. In this role he called on local education authorities to give private Muslim and Orthodox Jewish schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women. Straw briefly served as Shadow Secretary of State for the Environment under John Smith from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When Tony Blair became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow Home Secretary. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be \\"soft on crime\\", and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning \\"aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants\\" and calling for a curfew on children. =Home Secretary (1997‚Äì2001)= Appointed as Home Secretary after the 1997 general election, he brought forward the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases. These policies won praise from Margaret Thatcher who once declared \\"I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.\\" They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building‚Äîa policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, finalising the de jure abolition of the death penalty with the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998.The position of Secretary of State for Justice would not come into existence until 2007. In June 1997, Straw appointed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to conduct a review of the need for a new public inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster. He indicated to the judge at the outset that in the view of his officials \\"there was not sufficient evidence to justify a new inquiry\\". In contrast he had told parliament \\"I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final conclusion without a full and independent examination of the evidence.\\" He had given the families of the victims full assurance that he intended a thorough examination of the matter. He apologised in both 2012 and 2016 for the failures of his review. On 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled \\"The Inquiry into the Matters Arising from the Death of Stephen Lawrence\\". Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken \\"more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents\\" and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give first aid when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored and concluded that the force was \\"institutionally racist\\". (see also summary: ) It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was \\"the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary\\". As Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the electoral system for the European Parliament elections from plurality to proportional representation. In doing so, he advocated the use of the d'Hondt formula on the grounds that it produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formula, however, is less proportional than the Sainte-Lagu√´ formula which was proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Straw later apologised to the House of Commons for his misleading comments,McLean, Iain and Johnston, Ron (2009) 'When is proportional not proportional? Great Britain's 2009 elections to the European Parliament', Representation, 45: 351. but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place. In March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile. The Rotherham sexual abuse scandal continued at this time, and according to the Telegraph, Straw had highlighted the problem four years prior to the Jay Report being published, saying there was a \\"specific problem\\" in some areas of the country where Pakistani men \\"target vulnerable young white girls\\". White girls were, he said, viewed as \\"easy meat\\". Also in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing Saddam Hussein's regime, stating \\"we have faith in the integrity of the Iraqi judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven't done anything wrong.\\" He worried, along with William Hague, about the possibility of English nationalism: \\"As we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\\" =Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (2001‚Äì2006)= Straw appears at a press conference with United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice He was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed Robin Cook. Within months, Straw was confronted by the 11 September attacks in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to Tony Blair in Her Majesty's Government's prosecution of the \\"war against terrorism\\". In late September 2001, he became the first senior British government minister to visit Iran since the 1979 Revolution. In 2003, the governments of the US and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the Extradition Act 2003. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a prima facie case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest. There have been a series of causes c√©l√®bres involving the treaty, including the NatWest Three who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and Gary McKinnon who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir Scott Baker reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and \\"there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States\\". In a letter to The Independent in 2004, he claimed that Trotskyists \\"can usually now be found in the City, appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,\\" and recommended \\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Vladimir Lenin. In the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'√©tat attempt, Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'√©tat, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for Equatorial Guinea before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Straw were forced to apologise to The Observer after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot. In the run-up to the 2005 general election, Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War ‚Äì the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average; the Liberal Democrat's increase in vote share (+12.5%) surpassed Labour's loss (‚àí12.1%) . Craig Murray, who had been withdrawn as the ambassador to Uzbekistan, stood against his former boss (Straw was then Foreign Secretary) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the \\"War on Terror\\"; he received a 5% vote share. Straw was re-elected, and following his victory called MPAC an \\"egregious group\\", and criticised their tactics during the election. At the 2005 Labour Conference, the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis, and a prominent Labour Party member. At a point when Straw claimed his support for the invasion of Iraq was solely for the purpose of supporting the Iraqi government, 82-year-old Wolfgang was heard to shout \\"Nonsense\\", and was forcibly removed from the auditorium by several bouncers. The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force. McCartney, PM Tony Blair and other senior Labour members later issued apologies; Wolfgang was later elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. On 13 October 2005, Straw took questions from a public panel of individuals in a BBC Newsnight television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the exit strategy for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own‚Äîa Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him. Straw meets with US Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz and UK Ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer in 2001. In February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of cartoons picturing Mohammed in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. Straw voiced concern over the 2006 Lebanon War. Straw warned that Israel's military action \\"could further destabilise the already fragile Lebanese nation\\", while noting that \\"Israel has clear rights to defend itself proportionately\\". In August 2006, it was claimed by William Rees-Mogg in The Times that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the Bush administration, possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing Iran. This would be ironic, as Richard Ingrams in The Independent wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was also removed at Bush's request, allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US. Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as \\"Ayatollah Straw\\" after his frequent visits to Tehran in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks. Straw gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had \\"haunted him\\" and that it was the \\"most difficult decision\\" of his life. He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to. In July 2017, former Iraqi general Abdulwaheed al-Rabbat launched a private war crimes prosecution, in the High Court in London, asking for Straw, Tony Blair and former attorney general Lord Goldsmith to be prosecuted for \\"the crime of aggression\\" for their role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The High Court ruled that, although the crime of aggression was recognised in international law, it was not an offence under UK law, and, therefore, the prosecution could not proceed. Rendition and torture allegations Despite repeated denials about his complicity in extraordinary rendition‚Äîhe once dismissed the suggestion of UK involvement in the practice as a \\"conspiracy theory\\"‚ÄîStraw had been dogged for years over his alleged leading role in it, with specific accusations about the case of Libyan politician Abdel Hakim Belhadj arising in April 2012. In October 2012, The Guardian reported on the filing of court papers, which alleged that MI6 alerted Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services to the whereabouts of dissidents, co-operated in their rendition, sent officers and detailed questions to assist in their interrogation, and that Straw attempted to conceal this from MPs. The high court in London agreed in January 2017, against the wishes of the Conservative Party (UK) government, to hear a judicial review against the decision to not prosecute Straw and former head of MI6 Mark Allen in the case of the abduction and alleged torture of Belhadj and his pregnant wife were abducted in Bangkok in 2004 after a tip-off from Mi6 and were held for seven years in Tripoli where, Belhaj alleges, he and his wife were repeatedly tortured. The English Crown Prosecution Service had decided in June 2016 to not prosecute any members of the UK government citing a \\"lack of evidence\\" and the challenge to that decision resulted in the decision to allow a judicial review. After a successful action by the Conservative Party (UK) government the high court announced in July 2017 that the judicial review would be held in private and that evidence relating to the defence by the government and security services would neither be made available to Belhaj or his legal team nor made public. Criticising the decision Belhaj was quoted as saying that \\"I went through a secret trial once before, in Gaddafi's Libya. It took about a half hour, and I never saw any of the evidence against me. Later a guard came to my cell and tossed in a red jumpsuit ‚Äì that was how I found out that the secret court had sentenced me to die\\" and continued \\"what kind of a trial will it be if we put in a mountain of evidence and government officials can simply refuse to answer us\\". In response, Straw stated that he was opposed to extraordinary rendition and had not been complicit in it. =Leader of the House of Commons (2006‚Äì2007)= After the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a major reshuffle of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests. On 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand. 2006 debate over veils Rehman Chishti accompanying Benazir Bhutto to a meeting at the Foreign Office in 2005 with the then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. Also in attendance is Wajid Shamsul Hasan, the former High Commissioner of Pakistan. In October 2006, Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: \\"Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.\\"In quotes: Jack Straw on the veil ‚Äì BBC News. 6 October 2006 He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request. Straw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within British politics and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is an ongoing debate within the Muslim community whether the Qur'an and hadith (traditions of Muhammad) require the use of the full face veil. Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by Engage in the buildup to the 2010 United Kingdom general election. =Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (2007‚Äì2010)= Straw canvassing with local councillors in Blackburn Straw was appointed Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and Secretary of State for Justice on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the House of Commons. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and Alistair Darling served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13-year government from 1997 to 2010. In February 2009, Straw used his authority as Justice Secretary to veto publication of government documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings held in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003. Straw represented the government on a controversial edition of Question Time on 22 October 2009, against British National Party leader Nick Griffin on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on holocaust denial Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined. Alleged ambitions for premiership Andrew Thorpe-Apps, writing in the Backbencher, states that Straw knew he would be defeated by Gordon Brown in a leadership contest as Brown was 'consumed by this one ambition'.\\"Last Man Standing: Memoirs of a Political Survivor\\" , The Backbencher, 22 October 2012 Expenses claims Two months after learning that MPs' expenses were to be made public, Straw wrote to the fees office to confirm that he had over-claimed on the Council Tax for his constituency home. He attributed this to an oversight ‚Äì he had been entitled to a 'non-occupancy' discount of 50% for four consecutive years, but had continued to claim expenses for the full rate of Council Tax. Included with the letter was a cheque for the amount he believed he had overcharged, which itself turned out to have been miscalculated, leading Straw to send a further cheque with a note saying \\"accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit\\". =Retirement from front-bench politics (2010‚Äìpresent)= In August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a 'fresh start' for the Labour Party under a new leader. Straw has since described Gordon Brown's leadership as a \\"tragedy\\". In December 2010, ahead of the UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011, Straw was a signatory to a letter to The Guardian\\"Labour's yes to AV , The Guardian, 8 December 2010\\" arguing in favour of the alternative vote. In January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on Newsnight about Pakistani men. He said \\"there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.\\" His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in Derby. In April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. & F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services. Commenting on his appointment to ED&F; Man on a salary of ¬£30,000 per annum, Straw said, \\"There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in Blackburn for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there's no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it's really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.\\" In late 2011, Straw was appointed to the role of visiting professor to University College London School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the European Parliament.  Allegation of antisemitism  In 2013, at a round-table event of the Global Diplomatic Forum at the UK's House of Commons, Straw (who has partial Jewish heritage) was quoted by Israeli politician Einat Wilf, one of the panelists at the forum, as having said that among the main obstacles to peace was the amount of money available to Jewish organizations in the US, which controlled US foreign policy, and also Germany's \\"obsession\\" with defending Israel. Wilf stated: \\"It was appalling to listen to Britain's former foreign secretary. His remarks reflect prejudice of the worst kind... I thought British diplomats, including former ones, were still capable of a measure of rational thought.\\" Wilf said that she was shocked to hear Straw's comments and that she responded in the debate by stressing the role of the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign Jewish state.\\"I'm not remotely anti-Semitic, says ex-British FM Straw\\" . By Raphael Ahren, 28 October 2013, The Times of Israel. The Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland said that Straw's comments \\"echo some of the oldest and ugliest prejudices about 'Jewish power' and go far beyond mere criticism of Israel.\\"\\"Jack Straw to 'Post': 'I am not remotely anti-Semitic , The Jerusalem Post, by Henry Rome, 28 October 2013. Speaking to The Jerusalem Post, Straw strongly denied claims that his criticism was antisemitic. In a statement to The Times of Israel, Straw did not relate to whether he had said what Wilf alleged he said, but did say that there was no justification in any of his remarks for claims that he was being antisemitic. He pointed out that Wilf did not claim that he had embarked on an antisemitic diatribe, as had been claimed in many of the media reports. He wrote a statement to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which was described as follows: > Straw wrote that he had voiced concerns at the seminar over Israel's > \\"settlement-building ... on Palestinian land (in East Jerusalem, and the > Occupied Territories). This is illegal, as the British Foreign Secretary > William Hague has observed and in those terms. I said that this amounted to > 'theft' of Palestinians' land.\\" In addition, he said that he advocated at > the seminar \\"a tougher stand on this (and on the related issue of goods > exported from the Occupied Territories by Israelis) by the European Union.\\" > He said that he had pointed out in the past that one of the obstacles to an > EU policy on this had been \\"the attitude of Germany, who for understandable > reasons have been reluctant to be out of line with the Government of > Israel.\\" Responding to the claim by Wilf that he referred to \\"Jewish money\\", > Straw said that he had spoken at the seminar of the \\"Israeli lobby\\" and \\"the > problems which faced President Obama from AIPAC\\" and spoke of the way AIPAC > spends large sums of money supporting pro-Israeli candidates in American > elections. No article covering the allegations has quoted Straw's supposed > comments referring to \\"Jewish money\\". Cash for access In February 2015, Straw was secretly recorded by journalists from The Daily Telegraph and Channel 4 News, who posed as representatives of a fictitious Chinese company that wanted to set up an advisory council. Straw was recorded describing how he operated \\"under the radar\\" and had used his influence to change EU rules on behalf of a firm which paid him ¬£60,000 a year. Straw voluntarily withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party (but remained a member of the party itself) in February 2015 due to allegations from Channel 4 and The Daily Telegraph. Straw denied any wrongdoing or any breach of the parliamentary rules and voluntarily referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and withdrew from the Parliamentary Labour Party pending the Commissioner's inquiry. He told the BBC, \\"[I have] acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career\\". He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that \\"I have seen nothing which suggests that [Mr Straw's] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [the bogus company established by Channel 4] had been genuine.\\"Paragraph 82, Ibid She said that \\"the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he \\"neither exaggerated nor boasted\\" in what he said to the reporters.\\"Paragraph 80, Ibid The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and The Daily Telegraph, saying \\"if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for Channel 4's Dispatches, and The Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [the other was Sir Malcolm Rifkind] in their interviews and measured their words against the rules of the House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House.\\"Para 14 of Overall Conclusion, Ibid Media regulator Ofcom, however, took a different view; it judged in December 2015 that the journalists had investigated a matter of significant public interest and that their presentation had been fair. Personal life Straw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston, ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976, who died after five days because of a heart defect. On 10 November 1978, he married Alice Perkins, a senior civil servant. In 2006, Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator BAA, shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm Ferrovial. The couple have two adult children, Will and Charlotte. Straw supports his local football team Blackburn Rovers, and was made an honorary vice-president of the club in 1998 by Jack Walker. Straw has suffered from depression and tinnitus. In October 2015, he was given the Freedom of the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen. Straw still regularly contributes to politics and appeared during the BBC's coverage of the 2017 and 2019 general elections.

Those who served the mausoleum were called the Ordus and Jinong came to mean the highest priest of the portable mausoleum. The Ordus lived on the Kherlen River but later moved to the area now known as Ordos. After Dayan Khan, whose father was the Jinong, unified Mongolia, his descendants assumed the position until 1949.

Its main sectors of activity are civil aviation, space and defence. SABCA was established during 1920. Presently, it is owned by the French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Group and Dutch aerospace company Fokker, the latter in turn being a subsidiary of GKN. History During 1920, SABCA was founded with the purpose of locally designing and building aircraft to satisfy Belgium's emerging aviation requirements. Its first manufacturing site was adjacent to Haren Airport, in the suburbs of Brussels. During the Interwar period, the company produced a number of in-house designs, as well as engaging in the manufacture of both civil and military aircraft. Throughout its existence, SABCA has been a prolific user of production licenses, which have authorised the firm to build other manufacturers' aircraft. During 1926, the company constructed a total 15 Airco DH.4 light bombers.Jackson 1987, p. 60. While its operations were disrupted by the German occupation of Belgium during the Second World War, SABCA resumed operations shortly following the end of the conflict. In 1955, a new manufacturing plant was opened at Charleroi Airport. Around this same period, SABCA became involved in early European space programmes; the firm would be involved in the production of Spacelab as well as both the Ariane and Vega expendable launch systems. SABCA also cooperated with the Dutch manufacturer Fokker in the manufacture of its F27 Friendship and 50 short-haul airliners. Other civil programmes the firm was involved with include producing elements of the Dassault Mercure and VFW- Fokker 614 airliners. Throughout the postwar era, the company was involved in the manufacturing of large numbers of licensed aircraft as well as associated upgrade programmes; such aircraft included the Hawker Hunter, the Republic F-84 Thunderjet, the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter, the Dassault Mirage 5, and the AgustaWestland AW109 helicopter. During the 1970s and 1980s, SABCA was responsible for operating one of the two European production lines for the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon; a total of 164 aircraft would be manufactured at its Gosselies facility. The European co-production initiative was officially launched on 1 July 1977; under this arrangement, Fokker- produced components were delivered to General Dynamics' Fort Worth facility for fuselage assembly, which were then shipped back to Europe for final assembly of the aircraft at the SABCA's facility; deliveries to the Belgian Air Force started in January 1979. During the following year, SABCA commenced deliveries to the Royal Norwegian Air Force.Peacock 1997, pp. 14‚Äì16, 21.Richardson 1990, pp. 13‚Äì15. During 1989, SABCA's involvement in the civil aviation sector received a significant boost via the first risk-sharing contract with the multinational aerospace conglomerate Airbus. It has since been a participant in all Airbus programmes, including the A380, the A400M Atlas, and the A350 XWB. SABCA also designs and manufactures subassemblies on behalf of other manufacturers, including Dassault Aviation and Gulfstream Aerospace. During 1992, demand for composite components had grown to the point where a dedicated subsidiary, SABCA Limburg, was established to focus specifically on this activity.

Biography Little is known of the Revolt's leaders. It has been suggested that Jack Straw may have been a preacher. Some have argued that the name was in fact a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or one of the other peasants' leaders; all of them appear to have used pseudonyms, adding to the confusion.See Brie, F. W. 'Wat Tyler and Jack Straw', in The Historical Review, v.21, 81 (January, 1906). Brie states that \\"the Continuator of Knighton held this view [...] and that two or three ballads and several fifteenth-century chroniclers [...] speak of Jakke Straw being killed by Walworth at Smithfield [i.e. in the same manner as Wat Tyler].\\" Several chroniclers, including Henry Knighton, mention Straw, though Knighton erroneously confuses him with Tyler. Thomas Walsingham stated that Straw was a priest and was the second-in-command of the rebels from Bury St Edmunds and Mildenhall.Preest, D. (ed., transl.) The Chronica Maiora of Thomas Walsingham, 1376-1422, Boydell, 2005, p.148 This story is most likely a result of confusion with a John Wrawe, an unbeneficed priest who was formerly the vicar of Ringsfield near Beccles in Suffolk, and who seems to have led the Suffolk insurgency.Walsingham, p.142 Walsingham also states that Straw and his followers murdered both notable local figures in Bury and, after reaching the capital, several of its Flemish residents, an accusation also made by Froissart. However, according to information in the church of St Mary in Great Baddow, in Essex, England, Jack Straw led an ill-fated crowd from the churchyard there to the risings, and he is elsewhere referred to as the leader of the men from Essex (as opposed to Tyler, who led the rebels from Kent). Straw is generally supposed to have been executed in 1381 along with the other main figures of the Revolt. Froissart states that after Tyler's death at Smithfield, Straw (along with John Ball) was found \\"in an old house hidden, thinking to have stolen away\\", and beheaded.The Chronicles of Froissart ed. Macaulay, transl. Bourchier, p.82 Walsingham gives a lengthy (and most likely invented) 'confession' in which Straw states that the insurgents' plans were to kill the king, \\"all landowners, bishops, monks, canons, and rectors of churches\\", set up their own laws, and set fire to London.Walsingham, pp.147-148 The later chronicles of Raphael Holinshed and John Stow, in addition to detailing the 'confession', repeat a story, originating in the 15th-century account of Richard Fox, that Jack Straw, alias John Tyler, was provoked into his actions by an assault perpetrated on his daughter by a tax collector.Archer, I. W. 'Discourses of History in London', in Kewes, P. (ed) The Uses of History in Early Modern England, University of California Press, 2006, p.218 Jack Straw in English culture Whether Straw was a real person, a pseudonym for Tyler, or simply a result of confusion on the part of chroniclers remote from the events they were describing, he went on to become a part of the popular narrative of the revolt. Jack Straw and the other rebel leaders are introduced in John Gower's Vox Clamantis Book I Chapter XI. The defeat of the rebels is covered in Chapter IXX. Macaulay's notes to Vox include Thomas Fuller's translation of the Chapter XI passage. :Tom comes thereat, when called by Wat, and Simm as forward we find, :Bet calls as quick to Gibb and to Hykk, that neither would tarry behind. :Gibb, a good whelp of that litter, doth help mad Coll more mischief to do, :And Will he does vow, the time is come now, he'll join in their company too. :Davie complains, whiles Grigg gets the gains, and Hobb with them does partake, :Lorkin aloud in the midst of the crowd conceiveth as deep is his stake. :Hudde doth spoil whom Judde doth foil, and Tebb lends his helping hand, :But Jack the mad patch men and houses does snatch, and kills all at his command. Gower's lines were parodied by Geoffrey Chaucer. Straw is mentioned in the Nun's Priest's Tale of The Canterbury Tales, as the leader of a mob targeting foreign workers: :Certes, he Jakke Straw and his meinee :Ne made nevere shoutes half so shrille, :Whan that they wolden any Fleming kille.Geoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. 618. Straw was central to an anonymous 1593 play dramatising the events of the Rising, The Life and Death of Jack Straw. In the modern era, the rather confused reporting of events was briefly satirised in Sellar and Yeatman's parody of Edwardian-era popular history, 1066 and All That, stating that the peasants revolted \\"in several reigns under such memorable leaders as Black Kat, Straw Hat, John Bull and What Tyler?\\", with objectives including \\"to find out [...] which of them was the Leader of the Rebellion\\".p. 43. The names are presumably a humorous garbling of those of 15th-century rebel Jack Cade, Straw, John Ball, and Wat Tyler. Straw was commemorated in the name of a pub on the edge of Hampstead Heath, London, which closed in 2002. The Jack Straw's Castle, reputed to be the highest pub in London, took its name from a story that Straw addressed groups of rebels on the Heath from a hay wagon which became known as \\"Jack Straw's Castle\\".Full Pint Issue 6 , CAMRA North London.

As Ramon Berenguer I, he was Count of Provence in right of his wife. Biography Born on 11 November 1082 in Rodez, Viscounty of Rodez, County of Toulouse, Francia, he was the son of Ramon Berenguer II. He succeeded his father to co-rule with his uncle Berenguer Ramon II. He became the sole ruler in 1097, when Berenguer Ramon II was forced into exile. Responding to increased raids into his lands by the Almoravids in 1102, Ramon counter-attacked, assisted by Ermengol V, Count of Urgell, but was defeated and Ermengol killed at the battle of Mollerussa. During his rule Catalan interests were extended on both sides of the Pyrenees. By marriage or vassalage he incorporated into his realm almost all of the Catalan counties (except Urgell and Peralada). He inherited the counties of Besal√∫ (1111) and Cerdanya (1117) and in between married Douce, heiress of Provence (1112). His dominions then stretched as far east as Nice. In alliance with the Count of Urgell, Ramon Berenguer conquered Barbastro and Balaguer. He also established relations with the Italian maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa, and in 1114 and 1115 attacked with Pisa the then-Muslim islands of Majorca and Ibiza. They became his tributaries and many Christian slaves there were recovered and set free. Ramon Berenguer also raided mainland Muslim dependencies with Pisa's help, such as Valencia, Lleida and Tortosa. In 1116, Ramon traveled to Rome to petition Pope Paschal II for a crusade to liberate Tarragona. By 1118 he had captured and rebuilt Tarragona, which became the metropolitan seat of the church in Catalonia (before that, Catalans had depended ecclesiastically on the archbishopric of Narbonne). In 1127, Ramon Berenguer signed a commercial treaty with the Genoese. Toward the end of his life he became a Templar. He gave his five Catalan counties to his eldest son Ramon Berenguer IV and Provence to the younger son Berenguer Ramon. He died on 23 January/19 July 1131 and was buried in the Santa Maria de Ripoll monastery. Marriages and descendants * Ramon's first wife was Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez de Vivar, second daughter of El Cid (died ca. 1105).

The rate of diffusion is the speed with which the new idea spreads from one consumer to the next. Adoption (the reciprocal process as viewed from a consumer perspective rather than distributor) is similar to diffusion except that it deals with the psychological processes an individual goes through, rather than an aggregate market process. Theories There are several theories that purport to explain the mechanics of diffusion: *The two-step hypothesis ‚Äì information and acceptance flows, via the media, first to opinion leaders, then to the general population * The trickle-down effect ‚Äì products tend to be expensive at first, and therefore only accessible to the wealthy social strata ‚Äì in time they become less expensive and are diffused to lower and lower strata. *The Everett Rogers Diffusion of innovations theory ‚Äì for any given product category, there are five categories of product adopters: **Innovators ‚Äì venturesome, educated, multiple info sources; **Early adopters ‚Äì social leaders, popular, educated; **Early majority ‚Äì deliberate, many informal social contacts; **Late majority ‚Äì skeptical, traditional, lower socio-economic status; **Laggards ‚Äì neighbours and friends are main info sources, fear of debt. *Crossing the Chasm model developed by Geoffrey Moore ‚Äì This model overlays the Everett Rogers' adoption curve with a 'chasm'. According to Moore, the marketer should focus on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries (early adopters) and pragmatists (early majority). This is the chasm that he refers to. Technologies or products that cannot cross this chasm will die or remain niche. If successful, a firm can create a bandwagon effect in which the momentum builds and the product becomes ubiquitous. *Technology driven models ‚Äì These are particularly relevant to software diffusion. The rate of acceptance of technology is determined by factors such as ease of use and usefulness. Rate According to Everett M. Rogers, the rate of diffusion is influenced by: * The product's perceived advantage or benefit. * Riskiness of purchase. * Ease of product use ‚Äì complexity of the product. * Immediacy of benefits. * Observability. * Trialability. * Price. * Extent of behavioural changes required. * Return on investment in the case of industrial products. =Models= There are several types of diffusion rate models: #Penetration models ‚Äì use test market data to develop acceptance equations of expected sales volume as a function of time. Three examples of penetration models are: #*Bass trial only model #*Bass declining trial model #*Fourt and Woodlock model #Trial/Repeat models ‚Äì number of repeat buyers is a function of the number of trial buyers. #Deterministic models ‚Äì assess number of buyers at various states of acceptance ‚Äì later states are determined from calculations to previous states. #Stochastic models ‚Äì recognize that many elements of the diffusion process are unknown but explicitly incorporate probabilistic terms.

Around 200 men (or \\"Crusaders\\" as they preferred to be referred to) marched from Jarrow to London, carrying a petition to the British government requesting the re- establishment of industry in the town following the closure in 1934 of its main employer, Palmer's shipyard. The petition was received by the House of Commons but not debated, and the march produced few immediate results. The Jarrovians went home believing that they had failed. Jarrow had been a settlement since at least the 8th century. In the early 19th century, a coal industry developed before the establishment of the shipyard in 1851. Over the following 80 years more than 1,000 ships were launched in Jarrow. In the 1920s, a combination of mismanagement and changed world trade conditions following the First World War brought a decline which led eventually to the yard's closure. Plans for its replacement by a modern steelworks plant were frustrated by opposition from the British Iron and Steel Federation, an employers' organisation with its own plans for the industry. The failure of the steelworks plan, and the lack of any prospect of large-scale employment in the town, were the final factors that led to the decision to march. Marches of the unemployed to London, termed \\"hunger marches\\", had taken place since the early 1920s, mainly organised by the National Unemployed Workers' Movement (NUWM), a communist-led body. For fear of being associated with communist agitation, the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress (TUC) leaderships stood aloof from these marches. They exercised the same policy of detachment towards the Jarrow March, which was organised by the borough council with the support of all sections of the town but without any connection with the NUWM. During their journey the Jarrow marchers received sustenance and hospitality from local branches of all the main political parties, and were given a broad public welcome on their arrival in London. Despite the initial sense of failure among the marchers, in subsequent years, the Jarrow March became recognised by historians as a defining event of the 1930s. It helped to foster the change in attitudes which prepared the way to social reform measures after the Second World War, which their proponents thought would improve working conditions. The town holds numerous memorials to the march. Re-enactments celebrated the 50th and 75th anniversaries, in both cases invoking the \\"spirit of Jarrow\\" in their campaigns against unemployment. In contrast to the Labour Party's coldness in 1936, the post-war party leadership adopted the march as a metaphor for governmental callousness and working-class fortitude.

Unemployment was particularly heavy in Britain's traditional staple export industries‚Äîcoal mining, shipbuilding, iron and steel and textiles‚Äîall of which were in a slow decline from their Victorian heyday. Because of the concentration of these industries in the north of England, in Scotland and in Wales, the percentage of unemployed persons in these regions was significantly higher, sometimes more than double, than in the south throughout the interwar period. The decline of these industries helped to create pockets of long-term unemployment outside the normal cyclical variations; some workers had no work for years.Garside, p. 11 =Hunger marches= In 1921, in reaction to the rising levels of unemployment, the newly formed British Communist Party set up the National Unemployed Workers' Movement (NUWM).Kingsford, pp. 19‚Äì22 From 1922 until the late 1930s, under its charismatic leader Wal Hannington, the NUWM organised regular marches in which unemployed workers converged on London to confront Parliament, in the belief that this would improve conditions.Pearce and Stewart, p. 359 These became known as \\"hunger marches\\", reviving a name coined by the press in 1908, when a group of London's unemployed marched to Hyde Park.James Vernon, p. 56 The 1922 marchers sought a meeting with the new prime minister, Bonar Law, who refused to see them because of their undemocratic leadership. The march leaders were denounced in The Times as \\"avowed Communists ... who have been identified with disturbances in their own localities\\". The Labour Party and the TUC kept aloof, fearful of being tainted by association with the communist organisers. The same pattern was followed with subsequent NUWM marches; successive prime ministers‚ÄîStanley Baldwin in 1929, Ramsay MacDonald in 1930 and 1934‚Äîdeclined to meet the marchers' representatives, and the Labour Party and the TUC continued to keep their distance.Kingsford, pp. 107, 126 In 1931 MacDonald became head of a Conservative-dominated National Government that imposed a means test on unemployment benefits.Pearce and Stewart, pp. 403‚Äì06 and 357‚Äì58 Anger at the means test was the rationale for the 1932 hunger march,Kingsford, pp. 134‚Äì38 in which a series of rallies and demonstrations across London broke out into considerable violence; the leaders provoked clashes with opponents and police in Hyde Park, Trafalgar Square and Westminster which led to the arrest and imprisonment of the march's leaders.Kingsford, pp. 154‚Äì61 Although women were not allowed to march on the Jarrow march, women's contingents were present at other hunger marches across the 1930s. These women, who were often the wives of unemployed men, were often faced with restrictions, such as being forced to stay in workhouses if the local Labour Party would not accommodate them. Two additional national marches were held in 1934 and 1936. By this time the country had made a substantial recovery from the worst depression years of 1929‚Äì32. Unemployment was significantly down, annual growth was averaging 4%, and many parts of the country were enjoying a substantial boom in housing and consumer goods.Pearce and Stewart, pp. 364‚Äì65 The increasing prosperity was not, however, uniformly spread, and there were sharp contrasts between economic conditions in the south and those in the north-east, South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere, where the rate of recovery was much slower.Gardiner, p. 448 At the same time, the national mood was changing; external factors such as the rise of fascism in Europe helped to unify the British left, and there were more supportive voices in parliament on behalf of the unemployed.Kingsford, p. 167 The idea of marching as a means of expressing political or social grievances had by now become an accepted and well- established tactic, and there was a growing awareness of the problems complained of, which counterbalanced their exploitation by the Communists.Perry, p. 12 The historian A. J. P. Taylor considered that the hunger marchers had \\"displayed the failure of capitalism in a way that mere figures or literary description could not. Middle-class people felt the call of conscience\\".Taylor, p. 433 Local background: Jarrow =Town history= Jarrow, situated on the River Tyne in County Durham, northern England, entered British history in the 8th century, as the home of Bede, the early Christian monk and scholar.Wilkinson, pp. 11‚Äì12 After Bede, little changed in the remote rural community for a thousand years, although his monastery was dissolved under Henry VIII in the 16th century. The discovery of coal in the 17th century led to major changes. Mining on an industrial scale began in the early 1800s, resulting in the population of Jarrow more than doubling between 1801 and 1821 to around 3,500, largely from the influx of mineworkers.Wilkinson, pp. 13‚Äì16 The town's years as a coalfield were unhappy. Living conditions in many of the hastily erected cottages were insanitary, lacking water and drainage. There was a serious outbreak of cholera in Jarrow and northeast England in the winter of 1831‚Äì32, as part of an epidemic that spread from Europe and resulted in more than 200 deaths in Newcastle alone. Relations in Jarrow between employer and employee were poor; workers were held by the \\"bond\\" system whereby they were tied to a particular employer for a year, whether or not that employer could provide work.Wilkinson, pp. 20‚Äì21 Working conditions in the mines were dangerous: there were explosions in 1826, 1828 and 1845, each with large loss of life.Wilkinson, pp. 27‚Äì28 and 55 Attempts by workers to organise into a trade union were fiercely opposed by the employers. Nevertheless, miners conducted lengthy strikes in 1832 and 1844, each ending when hunger forced them back to work.Wilkinson, pp. 29‚Äì35 and 51‚Äì55 After the easier seams of coal were exhausted, the Jarrow pits became less profitable, and in 1851 the owners abandoned them altogether.Wilkinson, p. 57 =Shipbuilding= Charles Palmer, founder of Jarrow's shipyard Jarrow began its development as a shipbuilding town with the establishment in 1851 of Palmer's shipyard on the banks of the River Tyne. The first ship from the yard was launched in 1852, an iron-built and steam-powered collier; many more such carriers followed. In 1856 the yard began building warships, and was soon supplying many of the world's navies. With its associated iron and steel works, it became the largest shipbuilding centre in the country, employing thousands of men. Jarrow's population, at around 3,800 in 1850, had increased nearly tenfold to 35,000 by 1891. Palmer's was central to Jarrow's economy, both for the numbers employed there and for the ancillary businesses that served the needs of both the yard and town.Ritchie, p. 15 The shipyard generated high employment to Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town's historian and member of parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: \\"There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, and if you go there for an hour or two, reader, you will be black\\".Newcastle Chronicle, June 1858, quoted in Wilkinson, p. 72 According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir Charles Palmer, \\"regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable\\".Wilkinson, p. 73 In the 1890s, Britain held a near monopoly of the world's shipbuilding, with a share of around 80%.Smales, p. 259 This proportion fell during the early years of the 20th century to about 60%, as other countries increased their production.Lorenz, p. 3 Palmer's remained busy, and during the years of the First World War built many of Britain's warships: the battleship , the light cruiser , and numerous smaller vessels were all built in Jarrow.Wilkinson, p. 130 During the brief postwar boom of 1919‚Äì20, orders remained plentiful and Palmer's prospered. However, the firm's management had not anticipated the conditions that developed in the 1920s when, as Wilkinson says, \\"every industrial country that had bought ships from Britain was now building for itself\\".Wilkinson, p. 133 The firm made over-optimistic assessments of future demand, and invested accordingly. The anticipated demand did not materialise; by the mid-1920s, Palmer's was incurring heavy losses, and was close to bankruptcy.Wilkinson, pp. 137‚Äì39 It was temporarily reprieved by a short-lived boom in 1929, when orders rose and the town briefly enjoyed the prospect of an economic recovery.Wilkinson, pp. 141‚Äì42 =Closure of Palmer's= , the last ship to be launched from Palmer's shipyard, July 1932 On 24 July 1930 Palmer's launched its thousandth ship, the tanker Peter Hurll, but by this time the brief shipbuilding boom had been ended by the Great Depression, and there were no new orders on the firm's books.Wilkinson, pp. 153‚Äì55 Rumours of impending reorganisation and rationalisation in the industry gave the workforce cause for anxiety, which deepened with the formation in 1930 of National Shipbuilders Security Ltd (NSS). This was a company created by the government to assist shipbuilders by acquiring failing yards and dismantling them, so that production was concentrated within a smaller number of profitable yards. To ensure this rationalisation was sustained, the closed yards were banned from any shipbuilding activity for at least 40 years.Betty Vernon, p. 140Wilkinson, p. 149 During 1931, NSS was busy closing shipyards elsewhere in the country, while an order from the Admiralty for two destroyers kept Palmer's working until mid-1932. The second of these ships, , was the last ship launched from the yard, on 19 July 1932.Wilkinson, pp. 157‚Äì58 By this time, Palmer's was insolvent, but retained a faint hope of further naval contracts. These failed to materialise, and in June 1933 the firm's creditors appointed a receiver. By December 1933 rumours of NSS interest in the yard were appearing in the press, and in the House of Commons Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, told members: \\"There is nothing to be gained by giving Jarrow the impression that Palmer's can be revived\\". He continued: \\"Would it not be very much better to make a clean sweep of that as a shipyard, and throw open to the world for sale what is one of the finest and most convenient sites anywhere in Europe?\\"Wilkinson, p. 163 Despite efforts by management and workers to find an alternative solution, in the early summer of 1934 NSS acquired the yard, closed it, and began to dismantle its plant.Wilkinson, p. 161 Blythe wrote: \\"The only sound to compete with the unfamiliar noise of the marsh birds ... was the ring of the breakers' hammers.\\"Blythe, p. 188 Following the Palmer's closure, a small hope of relief and some industrial resurrection was offered by the industrialist Sir John Jarvis, who held the ceremonial office of High Sheriff of Surrey. He was the prospective Conservative candidate for Guildford. On 4 October 1934, Jarvis announced the \\"adoption\\" of Jarrow by the county of Surrey, and promised to bring new industries to the town; he mentioned ship-breaking, bottle manufacture and furniture-making. While acknowledging the generous principle behind Jarvis's scheme, Betty Vernon (biographer of Jarrow politician Ellen Wilkinson) described it as ultimately superficial, offering little more than patchwork assistance.Betty Vernon, p. 148 Blythe observes: \\"This excellent man failed, as anyone must fail who tries to play the good squire to a town of nearly forty thousand people\\".Blythe, p. 189 =Ellen Wilkinson= Ellen Wilkinson marching with the Jarrow Marchers, Cricklewood, London In the 1931 general election, in the nationwide rout of Labour, the Jarrow constituency was won by the National Government's candidate, William Pearson, a Conservative borough councillor and former mayor. In 1932, when the mood in Jarrow was desperate‚Äî\\"a workhouse without walls\\" according to one commentatorBetty Vernon, p. 138‚Äîthe local Labour Party selected Ellen Wilkinson as its parliamentary candidate for the next general election.Bartley, pp. 62‚Äì63 Wilkinson had helped to found the British Communist Party in 1920, and had a firebrand reputation. She had been associated with Hannington and the NUWM in the early 1920s,Betty Vernon, p. 63 but had left the Communist Party in 1923 and had served as Labour MP for Middlesbrough East between 1924 and 1931. Wilkinson felt a deep bond of sympathy with the people of Jarrow and the loss of the shipyard which was the life-source of the town. Early in 1934 she led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency.Bartley, p. 83 She records that at the end of the meeting MacDonald said to her: \\"Ellen, why don't you go out and preach socialism, which is the only remedy for all this?\\" This \\"priceless remark\\", she says, brought home the \\"reality and sham ... of that warm but so easy sympathy\\".Wilkinson, pp. 195‚Äì96 She became Jarrow's MP in the general election of November 1935, when she won the seat with a majority of 2,360.Betty Vernon, p. 240 In the opening debate of the new parliamentary session, on 9 December 1935, she pleaded on behalf of her new constituents: \\"These are skilled fitters, men who have built destroyers and battleships and the finest passenger ships ... The years go on and nothing is done ... this is a desperately urgent matter and something should be done to get work to these areas which, Heaven knows, want work.\\" =Proposed steelworks= While Jarvis's palliative measures were being developed, a more substantial project to bring industry back to Jarrow was under consideration. An American entrepreneur, T. Vosper Salt, became aware of the impending sale and break-up of Palmer's yard. He was convinced that the world demand for steel was about to rise, and thought that the site, with its ready-made docking and rail facilities, would be ideal for a new, modern steelworks. In January 1934, when an initial feasibility study report had proved favourable, Salt began discussions with the British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF), a steel producers' organisation formed that year as part of the National Government's rationalisation of the iron and steel industry.Wilkinson, pp. 172‚Äì73 The British steel industry was protected from more efficient foreign competition by the government's high tariff wall. The BISF, through its control of pricing, could also present a united front against new competition at home.Wilkinson, pp. 174‚Äì76 When the feasibility report was received by the BISF in March 1935 the Federation's chairman, Sir Andrew Duncan, at first reacted positively; his members from the north-east were rather less enthusiastic. Only one of the large steel firms in the region, the Consett Iron Company, offered support for a Jarrow steelworks, while other BISF members put pressure on London's financial institutions to withhold capital from the new scheme.Wilkinson, pp. 180‚Äì81 Reports of such tactics caused great anxiety in the Jarrow area, where the people were desperate for the new works to come about. In a reassuring speech shortly before the November 1935 general election, Baldwin, now leading the National Government, informed his listeners in Newcastle: \\"There is no truth in any of the reports that either the banks or any other authorities ... are making a dead set to prevent anything of the kind being done in the area\\".Quoted in Wilkinson, p. 180 After the election and the return of the National Government, little happened to support Baldwin's optimistic words. In the House of Commons on 2 March 1936, Wilkinson spoke of the \\"atmosphere of mystery\\" that surrounded the Jarrow scheme: \\"Publicly one sees tremendous optimism ... but when you see people privately there is a great deal of humming and ha'ing, and they are not quite sure\\". Meanwhile, the BISF argued that increased steel production should be achieved by expanding capacity in existing facilities, rather than by building new plant.Wilkinson, p. 162 Duncan, in a reversal of his earlier attitude, now opposed the provision of finance for Jarrow which, he felt, might create a precedent that other distressed areas could exploit. The BISF finally succeeded in watering down the scheme to the extent that it became unviable; Salt and his syndicate withdrew, and the scheme was dead, \\"strangled at birth\\" according to Wilkinson.Wilkinson, p. 186 In a series of exchanges in the Commons with Runciman on 30 June, Wilkinson requested in vain that the matter be reconsidered by an independent body, rather than being decided by the BISF. One of the government's own negotiators, who had been involved in the project since its early stages, wrote in The Times: \\"A system which permits the adjudication on a proposal of national importance ... to be left in the hands of parties whose financial interests may run counter to that project, is not conducive to the enterprising development of the steel industry\\". When, later in the summer, Runciman met workers from Jarrow the deputation encountered, in Wilkinson's words, \\"a figure of ice. Icily correct, icily polite, apparently completely indifferent to the woes of others.\\"Wilkinson, p. 197 His insistence that \\"Jarrow must work out its own salvation\\", was described by Blythe as \\"the last straw in official cruelty\\";Blythe, p. 190 to Wilkinson, the phrase \\"kindled the town\\", and inspired it to action.Wilkinson, p. 198 March =Preparation= Jarrow Town Hall, photographed in 2007, with a statue of Sir Charles Palmer. The statue has since been re-sited. After the loss of the steelworks, David Riley, the chairman of Jarrow Borough Council, told a rally of the town's unemployed in July 1936: \\"If I had my way I would organise the unemployed of the whole country ... and march them on London so they would all arrive at the same time. The government would then be forced to listen, or turn the military on us\\".Pickard, pp. 21‚Äì22 The idea of a march was taken up with enthusiasm by the mayor Billy Thompson, by Wilkinson, and by political, commercial and religious groups. It was decided that the march would be a local affair, representing the town, with no political connotations. It would be limited to 200 fit men who would arrive in London at the start of the new parliamentary session on 3 November 1936, when a petition from the town would be presented to the House of Commons.Wilkinson, pp. 198‚Äì202 Riley was appointed chief marshal, with four subcommittees to deal with organisational detail.Pickard, p. 14 All the local political parties‚ÄîLabour, Conservative and Liberal‚Äîgave their support, as did the town's churches and the business community. Relays of medical students from the Inter-Hospital Socialist Society agreed to accompany the march as medical attendants.Blythe, p. 194 A fund was begun, with an initial target of ¬£800, to meet the costs of the march; ultimately, nearly double that amount was raised, locally and on the route.Perry, pp. 45‚Äì46 Public meetings were planned for the overnight stops, to publicise the plight of Jarrow and of other areas like it. One marcher explained: \\"We were more or less missionaries of the distressed areas, [not just] Jarrow\\".Pickard, p. 89 On Monday 5 October the marchers, selected from over 1,200 volunteers, attended an ecumenical dedication service in Christ Church, Jarrow, where the blessing was given by James Gordon, the Bishop of Jarrow.Perry, pp. 21‚Äì23 This apparent endorsement by a senior cleric gained considerable press attention, but earned a sharp response from Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham. Henson, a severe critic of socialism and trade unionism, described the march as \\"revolutionary mob pressure\\", and regretted his colleague's association with \\"these fatuous demonstrations, which are mainly designed in the interest, not of the Unemployed, but of the Labour party\\".Henson's diary entry, 8 October 1936, quoted in Perry, p. 72 As Jarrow's representatives prepared to leave, six regional contingents of the sixth National Hunger March were taking the road to London, where they were due to arrive a week after the Jarrow marchers.Kingsford, p. 211Perry, pp. 12, 30 A group of blind veterans, organised by the National League of the Blind and Disabled, was also on the march, demanding better allowances for the country's 67,000 blind persons.Perry, pp. 12, 57 =On the road= { class= \\"wikitable\\" style=\\"float:right; margin-left:2em; text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + Route of Jarrow March, October 1936 !scope=\\"col\\" Stage !scope=\\"col\\" Date (1936)Perry, pp. 21, 31, 34, 39, 45, 53, 58, 63, 70, 76, 64, 87, 89, 92, 98, 100, 104, 111, 121, 126, 130, 134, 140 !scope=\\"col\\" From !scope=\\"col\\" To !scope=\\"col\\" Distance - !scope=\\"row\\" 1  5 October  Jarrow  Chester-le-Street  - !scope=\\"row\\" 2  6 October  Chester-le- Street  Ferryhill  - !scope=\\"row\\" 3  7 October  Ferryhill  Darlington  - !scope=\\"row\\" 4  8 October  Darlington  Northallerton  - !scope=\\"row\\" 5  9 October  Northallerton  Ripon  - !scope=\\"row\\"  10 October  Rest day   ‚Äî - !scope=\\"row\\"  11 October  Rest day   ‚Äî - !scope=\\"row\\" 6  12 October  Ripon  Harrogate  - !scope=\\"row\\" 7  13 October  Harrogate  Leeds  - !scope=\\"row\\" 8  14 October  Leeds  Wakefield  - !scope=\\"row\\" 9  15 October  Wakefield  Barnsley  - !scope=\\"row\\" 10  16 October  Barnsley  Sheffield  - !scope=\\"row\\" 11  17 October  Sheffield  Chesterfield  - !scope=\\"row\\"  18 October  Rest day   ‚Äî - !scope=\\"row\\" 12  19 October  Chesterfield  Mansfield  - !scope=\\"row\\" 13  20 October  Mansfield  Nottingham  - !scope=\\"row\\" 14  21 October  Nottingham  Loughborough  - !scope=\\"row\\" 15  22 October  Loughborough  Leicester  - !scope=\\"row\\" 16  23 October  Leicester  Market Harborough  - !scope=\\"row\\" 17  24 October  Market Harborough  Northampton  - !scope=\\"row\\"  25 October  Rest day   ‚Äî - !scope=\\"row\\" 18  26 October  Northampton  Bedford  - !scope=\\"row\\"  27 October  Rest day   ‚Äî - !scope=\\"row\\" 19  28 October  Bedford  Luton  - !scope=\\"row\\" 20  29 October  Luton  St Albans  - !scope=\\"row\\" 21  30 October  St Albans  Edgware  - !scope=\\"row\\" 22  31 October  Edgware  Marble Arch, London  - !scope=\\"row\\"    style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\" Total  style=\\"font- weight:bold;\\" } Jarrow to Ripon After the service of dedication, the marchers left Jarrow, cheered on by most of the town and bearing banners announcing themselves as the \\"Jarrow Crusade\\".Pickard, p. 91 By the following weekend they had travelled to the cathedral city of Ripon, where they were welcomed by the Bishop of Ripon and a delegation representing local churches.Perry, pp. 46‚Äì48 Receptions at the intervening stops had been mixed: lukewarm at Chester-le-Street,Perry, p. 26 warm and friendly from the people in Ferryhill and also from the Conservative-controlled council in Darlington.Pickard, p. 94Perry, pp. 35‚Äì36 Wilkinson had left the march at Chester-le-Street to attend the Labour Party's annual conference, taking place in Edinburgh.Perry, p. 27 The conference was not supportive of the march‚Äîone delegate criticised Wilkinson for \\"sending hungry and ill-clad men on a march to London\\".Wilkinson, p. 204 The Labour conference's negative stance brought angry responses from the marchers; Riley considered that they had been \\"stabbed in the back\\".Perry, p. 45 The marchers were further dismayed to learn that the Ministry of Labour's Unemployment Assistance Board had ruled that their benefits would be reduced, since they were unavailable for work should jobs arise.Blythe, p. 199 Ripon to Chesterfield After a weekend's rest, the marchers proceeded to Harrogate. In this solidly Conservative, prosperous town the marchers were greeted warmly by the civic authorities and were fed by the Rotary Club. They were given sleeping quarters by the Territorial Army,Perry, p. 55 a change from the school and church halls, and occasional workhouse accommodation, that was provided at most overnight stops. It was becoming evident that local Conservatives were often as likely to provide practical assistance as Labour, whose local parties were constrained by the attitude of the party's national leadership.Wilkinson, pp. 205‚Äì07 The marchers' claim that theirs was a unique situation, arising from specific actions (the closing of the shipyard and the blocking of the proposed steelworks) that could be remedied by immediate government action, may also have alienated local working-class communities. Cross-party support was important in maintaining the march's non-partisan ethos, a factor that led Riley to refuse a donation of ¬£20 from a communist group, stating: \\"We are determined at all costs to preserve the non-political character of this Crusade\\".Perry, pp. 84‚Äì85 At Harrogate Wilkinson rejoined the march, as it proceeded through southern Yorkshire towards Chesterfield in Derbyshire. The march was attracting wide publicity; in London the government worried that King Edward might exceed his constitutional limits and receive the marchers.Perry, p. 67 The cabinet issued a statement that emphasised the constitutional means for expressing grievances, and condemned marches for causing \\"unnecessary hardship for those taking part in them\\"‚Äî\\"crocodile tears\\", according to Wilkinson.Perry, p. 70 In reaching Chesterfield on 17 October, the marchers had travelled during the week, and were at the approximate half-way point in their journey. That day, the Bishop of Durham was gratified and the marchers correspondingly disappointed, when in a letter to The Times the Bishop of Jarrow denied that his blessing on the march had indicated his support for the venture. The blessing was, he said an act of Christian duty; in general he believed that such marches should be discouraged. Wilkinson was forgiving of the bishop's volte-face, knowing, she later said, \\"the difficulties he had to face\\".Wilkinson, p. 201 Chesterfield to Northampton Church of St Mark, Leicester, a stopping point for the march, photographed in 2013 The third week of the march covered the greatest distance of the four weeks‚Äî. At Mansfield, the Labour- controlled council defied the national leadership to give the marchers a warm welcome.Perry, p. 90 This was matched by the reception from Nottingham's Conservative mayor and councillors, and supplemented by gifts of clothing and underwear from the city's manufacturers.Perry, pp. 93‚Äì94 At Leicester, the Co- operative Society's bootmakers worked through the night without pay, repairing the marchers' boots. According to some accounts, the marchers presented the vicar of the Church of St Mark, Leicester, with a wooden cross, although Matt Perry, in his history of the Jarrow March, indicates that this cross was donated in 1934 by the national hunger march.Perry, p. 102 From Leicester the march moved to Market Harborough. This was one of the least welcoming of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on the stone floor of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so).Perry, p. 111 On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving at the same time as the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.Perry, pp. 113‚Äì14 Northampton to London Marble Arch, Hyde Park, London, the terminus for the Jarrow March The leg on Monday 26 October, from Northampton to Bedford, was the longest daily march‚Äî. Of the original contingent, 185 were still on the road, together with 10 replacements.Perry, pp. 121‚Äì22 To maintain the timetable for arrival at Marble Arch, the marchers took an extra rest day on Tuesday before marching, in teeming rain, the to Luton.Perry, pp. 124‚Äì27 On 29 October, as the marchers walked from Luton to St Albans, the plight of Jarrow was the subject of exchanges in the House of Commons between Wilkinson and Baldwin. The prime minister drew attention to the recent decrease in Jarrow's unemployed, and said: \\"There is every reason to hope that the revival of industry now in progress in the Tyneside area will result in further opportunities for employment for those still unemployed at Jarrow.\\" Wilkinson replied that the apparent decrease in Jarrow's unemployment figures arose from the amalgamation of the figures of Jarrow with those of a neighbouring town, and did not represent an increase in employment. She asked Baldwin whether he would break with tradition and meet a deputation of the marchers; the prime minister declined. On the penultimate stage, from St Albans to Edgware, as the march neared its end, marchers began to contemplate the return home, and the prospect of \\"looking out of the window ... knowing that there's nothing, nothing at all to do\\".Perry, p. 139 On the final day, for the short stretch, large crowds watched the column proceed through the London suburbs towards Marble Arch, marching to the accompaniment of their own mouth-organ band despite relentless rain.Perry, pp. 140‚Äì42 On arrival, as their leaders talked to the press, the marchers retired to their overnight accommodation in London's East End.Wilkinson, p. 208 =London= On Sunday 1 November the marchers proceeded to Hyde Park for a hastily organised public meeting. The Communist Party was holding a general rally in the park against unemployment; Wilkinson records that they \\"generously gave way for an hour and asked their great audience to swell our Crusade meeting\\".Wilkinson, p. 209 The police made a low estimate of 3,000 for the crowd, but the journalist Ritchie Calder, who was present, put the figure at 50,000.Perry, p. 146 After a day's rest, the marchers' main event on Tuesday was a public meeting in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street. Among the guest speakers was the Rev. Canon Dick Sheppard, founder of the Peace Pledge Union. He told the marchers: \\"You have so aroused the conscience of the country that things are bound to happen\\".Perry, pp. 159‚Äì60 Sir John Jarvis, without prior warning, then revealed plans for a steel tubes mill on the Palmers site. The impression that Jarrow's problems could be solved thus, without government action, disconcerted the listening marchers.Perry, pp. 160‚Äì61 Wilkinson commented that such plans were in the future, and were no substitute for the town's requirement for immediate government intervention.Wilkinson, pp. 210‚Äì11 On Wednesday 4 November Wilkinson presented the Jarrow petition to the House of Commons. With over 11,000 signatures, it asked that \\"His Majesty's Government and this honourable House should realise the urgent need that work should be provided for the town without further delay.\\" In the brief discussion that followed, Runciman said that \\"the unemployment position at Jarrow, while still far from satisfactory, has improved during recent months\\", to which James Chuter Ede, the Labour backbencher representing South Shields, the neighbouring constituency to Wilkinson's, replied that \\"the Government's complacency is regarded throughout the country as an affront to the national conscience\\". Blythe summarises the marchers' anger and disillusionment: \\"And that was that. The result of three months' excited preparation and one month's march has led to a few minutes of flaccid argument during which the Government speakers had hardly mustered enough energy to roll to their feet\\". A \\"stay-in\\" strike was briefly proposed, before Wilkinson arranged a meeting with a cross-party group of MPs. The marchers' case was heard sympathetically; the meeting was warned that, given international uncertainties, they might come to regret the dismantling of an important shipbuilding facility for reasons of private profit.Perry, pp. 166‚Äì70 Such statements, according to Wilkinson, made members \\"distinctly uncomfortable\\". The next day the marchers returned by train to Jarrow, where they received an ecstatic welcome from the town.Perry, pp. 174‚Äì75 Appraisal and legacy Bronze sculpture. The Spirit of Jarrow by Graham Ibbeson, unveiled in Jarrow Town Centre in 2001 as a memorial to the 1936 Jarrow March Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard.Wilkinson, p. 264 However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\".Pickard, p. 26 These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform. Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\".Perry, p. 1 Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\".Perry, p. 37 In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders‚ÄîMichael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair‚Äîhave all associated themselves with the march.Perry, p. 42 In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group from Jarrow and other towns along the way retraced the route to London. At that time of industrial recession, Jarrow once again had the highest level of unemployment in the country.Perry, p. 193 The 75th anniversary in 2011 was marked by a \\"March for Jobs\\", that drew the ire of a Conservative MP, Robert Goodwill, who noted the high level of withdrawals in its early stages and dismissed it as \\"an insult to the memory of the Jarrow marchers ... They are not fit to walk in [their] footsteps\\". Re- enactment 2011: the \\"March for Jobs\\" in London, 5 November 2011 Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march‚ÄîJames Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds‚Äîleft Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970.Perry, pp. 175, 36‚Äì37 In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government.Vernon, pp. 184‚Äì85 In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. \\"The Jarrow March\\" sculpture at Jarrow Metro station In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation.Symington, p. 116 Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march.Perry, pp. 115‚Äì16 On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history. The final event, revolved around the March, the re-enactment was described as a memorable closing to the finale. The town of Jarrow contains several commemorations, including a steel relief sculpture by Vince Rea at the new railway station, a tile mural designed by local schoolchildren, and a bronze sculpture‚Äî\\"The Spirit of the Crusade\\" by Graham Ibbeson‚Äîin the town centre. Buildings and street names bear the names of Wilkinson and Riley.

Berenguer Ramon II, who became the sole ruler of Catalonia for the next four years, was credited by popular opinion with having orchestrated this murder. This suspicion and other divisions of loyalty led to a civil war. Various parties asserted ways to resolve this 'unjust and iniquitous murder', which led to a moderate compromise in 1086 in which Berenguer Ramon II would rule Catalonia with his brother's four-year-old son Ramon Berenguer III for eleven years until he came of age.Pg 136, The Quest for El Cid, Richard Fletcher, In the 1080s Berenguer Ramon's involvement in the internal strife in the Moorish taifa kingdoms brought him in conflict with El Cid. In the ensuing war the Count of Barcelona was twice taken prisoner. After Berenguer Ramon's resignation in 1097 his life became more obscure. Still living under the accusations of his brother's assassination, the guilt of which may have been determined by trial by combat, which he lost, he went to Jerusalem, either on pilgrimage, as a penance, or as part of the First Crusade, and perished there between 1097 and 1099.

He promulgated the earliest versions of a written code of Catalan law, the Usages of Barcelona. Born in 1024, he succeeded his father, Berenguer Ramon I the Crooked in 1035.Bernard F. Reilly, 48-49. It was during his reign that the dominant position of Barcelona among the other Catalan counties became evident. Ramon Berenguer campaigned against the Moors, extending his dominions as far west as Barbastro and imposing heavy tributes (parias) on other Moorish cities. Historians claim that those tributes helped create the first wave of prosperity in Catalan history. During his reign Catalan maritime power started to be felt in the western Mediterranean. Ramon Berenguer the Old was also the first count of Catalonia to acquire lands (the counties of Carcassonne and Raz√©s) and influence north of the Pyrenees. Another major achievement of his was beginning the codification of Catalan law in the written Usatges of Barcelona which was to become the first full compilation of feudal law in Western Europe. Legal codification was part of the count's efforts to forward and somehow control the process of feudalization which started during the reign of his weak father, Berenguer Ramon. Another major contributor was the Church acting through the institution of the Peace and Truce of God. This established a general truce among warring factions and lords in a given region for a given time. The earliest extant date for introducing the Truce of God in Western Europe is 1027 in Catalonia, during the reign of his father, Berenguer Ramon. While still married to his second wife Blanca, he became involved with the wife of the Count of Toulouse, Almodis de La Marche, countess of Limoges.Patricia Humphrey, 34. Both quickly married and were consequently excommunicated by Pope Victor II.Bernard F. Reilly, 67. Ramon Berenguer I, together with his third wife Almodis, also founded the Romanesque cathedral of Barcelona, to replace the older basilica presumably destroyed by Almanzor. Their velvet and brass bound wooden coffins are still displayed in the Gothic cathedral which eventually replaced the cathedral that they founded.

It was developed by Arthur Cronquist in a series of monographs and texts, including The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants (1968; 2nd edition, 1988) and An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants (1981) (see Bibliography). Cronquist's system places flowering plants into two broad classes, Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons) and Liliopsida (monocotyledons). Within these classes, related orders are grouped into subclasses. While the scheme was widely used, in either the original form or in adapted versions, many botanists now use the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants, first developed in 1998. The system as laid out in Cronquist's An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants (1981) counts 64 orders and 321 families in class Magnoliopsida and 19 orders and 65 families in class Liliopsida.

The film was produced by Tony Adams and scored by Henry Mancini, with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse. Released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it was adapted in 1995 as a Broadway musical. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. It is a remake of the 1933 German film Viktor und Viktoria.  Plot  In 1934 Paris, Carroll \\"Toddy\\" Todd, an aging gay performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant. After her failed audition, Victoria returns to her hotel room to find herself evicted, unable to pay rent. That night, when Richard, a hustler with whom Toddy is romantically involved, comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome, Toddy incites a brawl. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria in a restaurant. She invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying, but it escapes and mayhem ensues. The duo runs through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she discovers the rain has shrunken her decrepit clothing. The next morning, Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his suit and hat, hides in Toddy's closet. When Richard opens the closet door, she punches Richard, breaks his nose and kicks him out. Seeing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man and presenting her to Andre Cassell, the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator. Cassell accepts her as Count Victor Grazinski, a gay Polish female impersonator and Toddy's new boyfriend. Cassell gets her a booking in a nightclub show and invites a collection of club owners to the opening. Among the guests is King Marchand, a Chicago gangster, and his ditzy blonde moll Norma Cassidy and burly bodyguard Bernstein, a.k.a. Squash. Victoria is an immediate hit, and King is smitten, but he is shocked when she is \\"revealed\\" to be a man at the end of the act. King, however, is convinced that \\"Victor\\" is not a man. After Norma violently attacks King during a quarrel, he sends her back to America. Determined to get the truth, King sneaks into Victoria and Toddy's suite and confirms his suspicion when he spies her getting into the bath. He invites Victoria, Toddy, and Cassell to Chez Lui. Another fight breaks out. Squash and Toddy are arrested, along with many of the club clientele, but King and Victoria escape. King kisses Victoria, pretending that he does not care about Victoria's gender, leading them to get together. Squash returns to the suite and catches King in bed with Victoria. King tries to explain, but then Squash reveals he himself is gay. Meanwhile, Labisse hires a P.I., Charles Bovin, to investigate Victor. Victoria and King live together for a while, but keeping up her deception strains the relationship to the breaking point, and King ends it. Back in Chicago, Norma, still angry over being dumped, tells King's business partner Sal Andretti that King is having an affair with a man. At the same time that Victoria has decided to give up the persona of Victor in order to be with King, Sal arrives and demands that King transfer his share of the business to Sal for a fraction of its worth. Squash tells Victoria what is happening, and she shows Norma that she is really a woman, saving King's stake. That night at the club, Cassell tells Toddy and Victoria that Labisse has lodged a complaint against him and \\"Victor\\" for perpetrating a fraud. The inspector tells Labisse that the performer is a man and Labisse is an idiot. In the end, Victoria joins King in the club as her real self. The announcer says that Victor is going to perform, but instead of Victoria, Toddy masquerades as \\"Victor\\". After an intentionally disastrous, but hilarious performance, Toddy claims that this is his last performance.

However, the lyrics or situations of some of the songs are calculated to relate to the unfolding drama. Thus, the two staged numbers \\"Le Jazz Hot\\" and \\"The Shady Dame from Seville\\" help to present Victoria as a female impersonator. The latter number is later reinterpreted by Toddy for diversionary purposes in the plot, and the cozy relationship of Toddy and Victoria is promoted by the song \\"You and Me\\", which is sung before the audience at the nightclub. # \\"Gay Paree\\" ‚Äì Toddy (music composed by Henry Mancini) # \\"Le Jazz Hot!\\" ‚Äì Victoria (music composed by Henry Mancini) # \\"The Shady Dame from Seville\\" ‚Äì Victoria (music composed by Henry Mancini) # \\"You and Me\\" ‚Äì Toddy, Victoria (music composed by Henry Mancini) # \\"Chicago, Illinois\\" ‚Äì Norma (music composed by Henry Mancini) # \\"Crazy World\\" ‚Äì Victoria (music composed by Henry Mancini) # \\"Finale/Shady Dame from Seville (Reprise)\\" ‚Äì Toddy (music composed by Henry Mancini) Occasionally, Victoria and Toddy sing \\"Home on the Range\\" when they are in the hotel. Production The film's screenplay was adapted by Blake Edwards (Andrews' husband) from the 1933 German film Viktor und Viktoria written and directed by Reinhold Sch√ºnzel from an original story treatment by Hans Hoemburg. According to Edwards, the screenplay took only one month to write. Julie Andrews watched the 1933 version to prepare for her role. The film had been planned as early as 1978 with Julie Andrews to star alongside Peter Sellers, but Sellers died in 1980 while Andrews and Blake Edwards were filming S.O.B. (1981), so Robert Preston was cast in the role of Toddy that originally was envisaged for Sellers. The costume worn by Julie Andrews in the number \\"The Shady Dame from Seville\\" is in fact the same costume worn by Robert Preston at the end of the film. It was made to fit Preston, and then, using a series of hooks and eyes at the back, it was drawn in tight to fit Andrews' shapely figure. Additional black silk ruffles were also added to the bottom of the garment, to hide the differences in height. The fabric is a black and brown crepe, with fine gold threads woven into it, that when lit appears to have an almost wet look about it. Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 33 reviews, with the site's consensus: \\"Driven by a fantastic lead turn from Julie Andrews, Blake Edwards' musical gender-bender is sharp, funny and all-round entertaining.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 84 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 3 out of 4 stars and wrote: \\"Not only a funny movie, but, unexpectedly, a warm and friendly one.\\" Variety called it \\"sparkling, ultra- sophisticated entertainment from Blake Edwards.\\" =Accolades= Victor/Victoria won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and its Adaptation or Adaptation Score. It was also nominated for: * Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Robert Preston) * Best Actress in a Leading Role (Julie Andrews) * Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Lesley Ann Warren) * Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Rodger Maus, Tim Hutchinson, William Craig Smith, Harry Cordwell) * Best Costume Design * Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium Julie Andrews won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

The film stars Jessica Lange as Frances Farmer, a troubled actress during the 1930s whose career suffered as a result of her mental illness. It also features Kim Stanley, Sam Shepard, Bart Burns, Jonathan Banks, and Jeffrey DeMunn in supporting roles. The film chronicles Farmer's life from her days as a high school student, her short lived film career in the 1930s, her institutionalization for alleged mental illness in the 1940s, her deinstitutionalization in the 1950s and her appearance on This Is Your Life. Frances was released theatrically on December 3, 1982 by Universal Pictures. Lange's performance was unanimously praised and has been cited by many (including her) as her best performance. At the 55th Academy Awards, it received two nominations for Lange and Stanley as Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively. Plot Born in Seattle, Washington, Frances Elena Farmer is a rebel from a young age, winning $100 in 1931 from The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards for a high school essay called God Dies. In 1935, she becomes controversial again when she wins (and accepts) an all- expenses-paid trip to the USSR to visit its Moscow Art Theatre. Determined to become an actress, Frances is equally determined not to play the Hollywood game: she refuses to acquiesce to publicity stunts, and insists upon appearing on screen without makeup. She marries her first husband, Dwayne Steele, despite being advised not to, but cheats on him with alleged Communist Harry York on the night of her hometown's premiere of Come and Get It. Her defiance attracts the attention of Broadway playwright Clifford Odets, who convinces Frances that her future rests with the Group Theatre. After leaving Hollywood for New York City and appearing in the Group Theatre play Golden Boy, Frances learns, much to her chagrin, that the Group Theatre exploited her fame only to draw in more customers, replacing her with a wealthy actress for her family's needed financial backing for the play's London tour, and Odets ends their affair upon his wife's upcoming return from Europe. Her desperate attempts to restart her film career upon returning to Hollywood results in being cast in unchallenging roles in forgettable B-films. Her increased dependence on alcohol and amphetamines in the 1940s and the pressures brought on her by her wannabe mother, who becomes her legal guardian after her multiple legal problems, result in a complete nervous breakdown. After her first hospitalization at Kimball Sanitarium in La Crescenta where she was forced to undergo insulin shock therapy and hydrotherapy, she tells her mother that she doesn't want to return to Hollywood but instead wants to live alone in the countryside, assaulting and threatening Lillian in the resulting argument. While institutionalized at Western State Hospital, Frances is abused by the powers-that-be: she is subjected to electroconvulsive shock therapy, is cruelly beaten, periodically raped by the male orderlies and visiting soldiers from a nearby military base and involuntarily lobotomized before her release in 1950. In 1958, Frances is paid honor on Ralph Edwards' This Is Your Life television program, which Harry York watches from his home. When asked about alcoholism, illegal drugs and mental illness, Farmer denies them all and says, \\"If you're treated like a patient, you're apt to act like one\\". The film ends just after a party honoring her at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with Farmer walking down a street with Harry York, talking about her parents' deaths, how she sold their house and that she's a \\"faceless sinner\\" with a slower paced lifestyle ahead of her in the future. The end credits state that she moved to Indianapolis shortly afterwards, hosting a local daytime TV program (Frances Farmer Presents) from 1958 to 1964 before dying-as she lived-alone on August 1, 1970 at age 56.

Brooks was keen for David Lynch, who had directed The Elephant Man, to direct. However, Lynch had signed an agreement with Universal. Sanger then suggested Graeme Clifford, who was well established as an editor, notably having made several films with Robert Altman. \\"He's very bright and completely in love with the story,\\" said Brooks.Mel Brooks and the sad Seattle cinema usherette The Guardian 10 Oct 1981: 11. The script was based upon William Arnold's Shadowland, a fictional biography of Farmer. In pre-production, the producers reneged on their option to use the book as source material. Arnold filed an unsuccessful copyright infringement lawsuit but many of his fictional elements were incorporated into the final film.Hollywood's power of attorney Mills, Bart. The Guardian 12 Feb 1983: 6. On the commentary of the DVD release, director Clifford stated, \\"We didn't want to nickel and dime people to death with facts.\\" Mel Brooks was executive producer of the film, but received no credit for his participation. They struggled to gain finance until EMI Films stepped in.CLIFFORD GETS FIRST SHOT AS DIRECITOR IN 'FRANCES' Pollock, Dale.

Jessica Lange had wanted to play the role since reading Farmer's memoirs in the late 1970s. She tried to interest Bob Rafelson and Bob Fosse to make the film but neither were interested.

According to Barry, his idea of carrying the main theme using a harmonica was initially disliked by producers until they heard it fully orchestrated. =Editing= The film originally ran for three hours and was cut down. This meant reduction of the amount of screen time dedicated to Frances and her parents, and Frances and her love interest. Clifford would subsequently claim he felt the film was too short. Reception Frances holds a 66% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews. Lange received universal acclaim for her performance. Anthony Hopkins, after working with Lange on Titus has proclaimed that Lange's performance as Frances Farmer is the best performance by any actress. Lange has ranked her performance as Farmer as the greatest part she has ever played onscreen. Awards and nominations Frances was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Jessica Lange) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Kim Stanley). The film was also entered into the 13th Moscow International Film Festival where Lange won the award for Best Actress.

Habitat Rat snakes live in a variety of habitats; some overlap each other. Rat snakes are excellent climbers and spend time in trees. They live in habitats ranging from a rocky hillside to flat farmland. Preferred habitat It prefers heavily wooded areas and is known for having excellent climbing ability, including the ability to climb the trunk of large mature trees without the aid of branches; the snake is also a competent swimmer. During winter it hibernates in dens, often with copperheads and timber rattlesnakes. This association gave rise to one of its common names, pilot black snake, and the superstition that this nonvenomous species led the venomous ones to the den.

Showing \\"kinked\\" threatened posture Western Rat Snake swimming on water in North East Texas Behavior When not fully grown, rat snakes are subject to predation by many animals, including other snakes. Once they attain maturity, they are readily preyed on by mammalian carnivores (including the American mink, which weighs no more than an adult rat snake) and large birds of prey (especially red- tailed hawks).Eastern Ratsnake. Pantherophis alleghaniensis. Natural Heritage Endangered Program. mass.gov When startled, they may freeze and wrinkle themselves into a series of kinks. If they feel further threatened, they may flee quickly or tail vibrate (potentially a form of mimicry, which makes them sound like rattlesnakes). They are also capable of producing a foul-smelling musk, which they will release onto predators if picked up. They spread the musk with their tails in hopes of deterring the threat.Fact Sheet at Smithsonian National Zoological Park Website . Nationalzoo.si.edu. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. When cornered or provoked, black snakes are known to stand their ground and can become aggressive. Counterattacks on large birds of prey, often committed by large snakes in excess of in length, have resulted in violent prolonged struggles. Utilizing its infamous agility and the great strength of its muscular coils, the black rat snake is sometimes able to overwhelm and kill formidable avian predators such as red-tailed hawks, great horned owls and red-shouldered hawks, though in many cases the bird is able to kill the snake and both combatants may even die.Bent AC (1937).

Feeding Raiding a bluebird birdhouse This species is a constrictor, meaning it squeezes its prey to the point of cardiovascular collapse due to obstructive shock, coiling around small animals and tightening its grip until they can no longer circulate blood and die of profound hypotension, before eating them. Though they will often consume mice, voles, and rats, western rat snakes are far from specialists at this kind of prey and will readily consume any small vertebrate they can catch. Other prey opportunistically eaten by this species can include other snakes (including both those of their own and other species), frogs, lizards, chipmunks, squirrels, juvenile rabbits, juvenile opossums, songbirds, and bird eggs.Schmidt KP, Davis DD (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. xiii + 365 pp. (Elaphe obsoleta obsolete, pp. 148-150, Figure 40 + Plate 16, center, on p. 336). One snake was observed to consume an entire clutch of Mallard eggs. Cavity-nesting bird species are seemingly especially prevalent in this snake's diet. The rat snake has been noted as perhaps the top predator at purple martin colonies as a single large snake will readily consume a number of eggs, hatchlings, and adults each summer. Several rat snake repelling methods have been offered to those putting up martin houses, but most are mixed in success.Rat Snakes . Purplemartin.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. Reproduction Mating while climbing a tree Mating takes place in late May and early June. The male snake wraps its tail around the female with their vents nearly touching. The male then everts one of its sex organs, a hemipenis, into the female sex organ, cloaca. The mating lasts a few minutes to a few hours. After five weeks, the female lays about 12 to 20 eggs, which are long by wide. The eggs hatch about 65 to 70 days later in late August to early October.Black snake profile at Smithsonian National Zoological Park website . Nationalzoo.si.edu. Retrieved on 2012-12-19. The hatchlings are in total length, and they look like miniature fox snakes. Taxonomy This species has previously been placed (and is still placed by many) in the genus Elaphe, as Elaphe obsoleta. However, Utiger et al. found that Elaphe is broadly construed as paraphyletic, and placed this species in the genus Pantherophis. In addition, because Pantherophis is masculine, the specific epithet becomes the masculine obsoletus.Elaphe obsoleta at The Center for North American Herpetology. Accessed 20 June 2008. The split of Pantherophis from Elaphe has been further confirmed by additional phylogenetic studies. In 2001, Burbrink suggested this species be divided into three species based on geographic patterns of mitochondrial DNA diversity. He assigned new common names and resurrected old scientific names, resulting in the following combinations: eastern ratsnake (Elaphe alleghaniensis, now Pantherophis alleghaniensis), central ratsnake (Elaphe spiloides, now Pantherophis spiloides), and western rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta, now Pantherophis obsoletus). However, these three species are not morphologically distinct and overlap in all examined morphological characters. More recent investigations have indicated P. alleghaniensis and P. spiloides interbreed freely in Ontario. In 2008, Collins and Taggart resurrected the genus Scotophis for Burbrink's three taxa (i.e., Scotophis alleghaniensis, Scotophis spiloides, and Scotophis obsoletus) in response to the findings of Burbrink and Lawson, 2007. The justification for this nomenclatural change has been removed by more recent research. In captivity Western rat snakes are popular as pets. Their size, calm temperament, and ease of care contribute to this popularity and they also occur in many mutations such as leucistic, albino, and scaleless. They enjoy hiding and burrowing which is usually accommodated with a loose substrate (such as aspen wood shavings or newspaper) and one or more hide boxes. Captive rat snakes are generally fed killed or stunned mice because captive-bred mice reduce the risk of exposing the snake to pathogens or live prey-induced injuries.

The Entwicklungsring Nord (Northern development circle) ‚Äî abbreviated ERNO ‚Äî was a 1961 joint venture of Bremen- based Weserflug and Focke-Wulf with Hamburger Flugzeugbau to develop parts for rockets and get involved in space activities. In 1961 work began on a small, jet-powered transport aircraft initially styled Erno-61-4. After Weserflug and Focke Wulf formally merged into Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) in 1964, the machine was redesignated VFW 614. The draft design was amended to a STOL 40-44 passenger jet with overwing engines, for easier operation from unprepared runways. German government subsidies enabled development to start in earnest in 1966. The first prototype started in August 1968, but then VFW and Fokker of the Netherlands formed a joint transnational holding company. VFW-Fokker teamed with Republic Aviation to develop the D-24 Alliance Variable sweep wing VTOL aircraft as part of the AVS (\\"Advanced Vertical Strike\\").https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1967/1967%20-%200918.PDFhttps://warisboring.com/germany- s-failed-attempts-to-build-a-cold-war-jump-jet/ The prototype flew on July 14, 1971, but crashed next February. Two more prototypes flew in 1972. German, FAA, and French DGA certifications completed in 1974, 1975, and 1976 respectively. The collaborative production arrangements involved Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB) in Germany, Fokker VFW in the Netherlands and SABCA and Fairey in Belgium. The first sale was to Cimber Air, which started commercial flights in November 1975. The VFW-Fokker alliance affected the VFW 614 negatively, as Fokker needed to sell its competing F27 and F28. National subsidies were diverted to the Airbus program, and the end came for the VFW-614. On August 19, 1977 the nineteenth (including prototypes) and last machine was completed. Few VFW 614 aircraft remained in use. Only the Koln/Bonn Flugbereitschaft der Luftwaffe continued flying VFW 614 until they finally ceased in 1998. Only DLR in Braunschweig (region) and EADS Airbus at Bremen now retain the machines for research duties. The European Space Agency ESA in June 1974 named a consortium headed by ERNO-VFW Fokker (Zentralgesellschaft VFW-Fokker GmbH) to build pressurized modules for Spacelab. British Aerospace, under contract to ERNO-VFW Fokker, built five -long, unpressurized, U-shaped pallet segments. West Germany provided 53.3% of Spacelab's cost and fulfilled 52.6% of all Spacelab work contracts. ERNO VFW Fokker, in competition with MBB, submitted the winning design, and became the prime contractor for Spacelab. MBB in 1981 took over VFW Fokker. The ERNO plant in Bremen continued as the headquarters for Spacelab design, production management, component testing, and assembly. Today, it is a part of EADS Astrium Space Transportation.

The film tells the story of how one small suburban town near the San Francisco Bay Area slowly falls apart after a nuclear war destroys outside civilization. Originally produced for the PBS series American Playhouse, it was given a theatrical release instead by Paramount Pictures (although PBS did subsequently air it a year later). The cast includes Jane Alexander, William Devane, Leon Ames, Lukas Haas, Roxana Zal and, in small roles shortly before a rise in their stardom, Kevin Costner and Rebecca De Mornay. Alexander was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance. Plot The Wetherly family‚Äîhusband Tom (William Devane), wife Carol (Jane Alexander), and children Brad (Ross Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas)‚Äîlive in the fictional suburb of Hamelin, California, within a 90-minute drive of San Francisco, where Tom works. On a routine afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and volunteer for school functions such as directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it. Suddenly, the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is then seen through the window. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family hopes Tom will return, but the circumstances are hard to ignore. The suburb of Hamelin survives relatively unscathed, because apparently the town is far enough from San Francisco to avoid blast damage. Frightened residents meet at the home of Henry Abhart (Leon Ames), an elderly ham radio operator. He has made contact with survivors in rural areas and internationally, and tells Carol that he was unable to reach anyone east of Keokuk, Iowa; a radio report told of a conjectured errant bomb hitting Yosemite National Park, causing trees and rocks to fall from the sky like rain. He reveals that the entire Bay Area and all major U.S. cities are radio- silent. The morning after the attack, they are joined by a child named Larry (Mico Olmos) who tells Carol his parents never returned home from San Francisco (he was alone all night); he is soon part of the family, but later succumbs to radiation poisoning. Despite Abhart's efforts, no one knows or finds out the reason for the attack nor the responsible parties. Rumors from other radio operators range from a Soviet preemptive strike to terrorism. The school play about the Pied Piper of Hamelin was in rehearsal before the bombings; desperate to recapture some normality, the town decides to go on with the show anyway. The parents smile and clap, many of them in tears. Hamelin escaped bomb damage, but not the significant radiation from nuclear fallout. The day after the attack, the children notice \\"sand\\" on their breakfast plates: contaminated fallout dirt settling back onto the ground from the blast. Residents have to cope with losing municipal services, food and gas shortages and, ultimately, the loss of loved ones to radiation sickness. Scottie, the first to succumb, is buried in the back yard. Carol screams at a Catholic priest (Philip Anglim) that she will not bury Scottie without his favorite (and missing) teddy bear. Wooden caskets are used as fuel for funeral pyres instead as the dead accumulate faster than they can be buried. Carol sews together a burial shroud out of bed sheets for her daughter, Mary Liz, who also dies from radiation exposure. While many of the children die, older residents fall to rapid dementia, and order in the town starts to break down as police and firefighter ranks dwindle from the radiation. A young couple (Kevin Costner and Rebecca De Mornay) leave town after losing their infant, hoping to find safety and solace elsewhere. Carol's search for a battery causes her to listen once more to her husband's final message on the answering machine. To her sorrow, she finds a later (and previously unheard) message on the machine from Tom: he decided to stay at work late in San Francisco on the day of the attack, and she now gives up her last hope that he will someday return home. Son Brad, forced into early adulthood, helps his mother and takes over the radio for Henry Abhart, who eventually dies. A bully who tormented Brad is caught breaking into their home; Brad tries to fight him off, but Carol scares him away. He manages to steal Brad's bicycle, and Brad starts using his father's bike, symbolically becoming the man of the house. The family adopts a mentally disabled boy named Hiroshi (Gerry Murillo), who Tom used to take fishing along with the other Wetherly kids, after Hiroshi's father Mike (Mako Iwamatsu) dies. Soon after Carol starts showing signs of radiation poisoning. One night, Carol is outside when she sees a pile of bodies being burned. Stopping and staring at the fire for a moment, she then breaks down and cries. Carol decides she, Brad and Hiroshi should avoid a slow and painful death by radiation poisoning and instead take their own lives via carbon monoxide poisoning. They are all sitting in the family's station wagon with the engine running and the garage door closed, but Carol cannot bring herself to go through with the deed. The three end up sitting by candlelight to celebrate Brad's birthday, using a graham cracker in place of a cake. When asked what they should wish for, Carol answers: \\"That we remember it all...the good and the awful.\\" She blows out the candle. In closing, an old family film of a surprise birthday party for Tom plays, showing him as he blows out the candles on his cake.

Reception Testament received positive reviews from the few critics who got the opportunity to see it. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82% based on reviews from 11 critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a rare four stars out of four, and was highly enthusiastic about the film. Ebert wrote that the film was powerful and made him cry, even after the second time he watched it. Ebert wrote: \\"The film is about a suburban American family, and what happens to that family after a nuclear war. It is not a science-fiction movie, and it doesn't have any special effects, and there are no big scenes of buildings blowing over or people disintegrating. We never even see a mushroom cloud. We never even know who started the war. Instead, Testament is a tragedy about manners: It asks how we might act toward one another, how our values might stand up, in the face of an overwhelming catastrophe.\\" Christopher John reviewed Testament in Ares Magazine Special Edition #2 and commented that \\"Testament may not change any lives, but it is bound to change the way some people think. Considering the subject matter, every little bit will help.\\" Testament was nominated for one Academy Award, a Best Actress nomination for Jane Alexander. =Home media= Testament was released by Paramount Home Video on Beta, VHS videocassette, Laserdisc and RCA's CED System in 1984. The film was released on DVD in 2004 in an edition that contained three featurettes: Testament at 20, Testament: Nuclear Thoughts, and Timeline of the Nuclear Age; this edition has gone out of print. As part of its 2013 agreement with Paramount Pictures, Warner Home Video made the film available in 2014 for purchase on MOD (Manufactured on Demand) DVD Recordable disc via its Warner Archive Collection.

Types include equipment, trophies, sports cards, autographs, photographs, etc. A multi- billion-dollar industry has grown up around the trading of sports memorabilia. Individual items can be valued in the millions of dollars. For example, a T206 Honus Wagner baseball card was sold for $2.8 million in 2007. As a result, fakes have become a serious problem. Monetary value Items that have been in direct contact with a famous athlete can have significant monetary value. Game used items such as the ball which Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run of the 1998 season sold for $3 million. The most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold, a New York Yankees baseball jersey worn by Babe Ruth during the 1920 season, sold for $4,415,658 in 2012. In 2016, the ten most valuable sports cards and memorabilia sold for a record-setting combined $12,186,294. Autographed pieces of memorabilia are usually more valuable that non-autographed items. Items that have been personalized (i.e. \\"To Mark,\\" Best Wishes Travis,\\" or \\"Happy Birthday John\\") can add sentimental value. Collectors who are interested in purchasing sports memorabilia often look for a certificate of authenticity. Several companies have developed systems to prove authenticity of game-used or autographed memorabilia, and collectors will generally seek out dealers that offer a lifetime, money-back, authenticity guarantee. The value of a signed item will generally be relative to the profile of the signer and the scarcity of similar items. When a high- profile sports star dies, the value often rises as there will no longer be an opportunity to get more. For example, the death of Muhammad Ali in 2016 raised both demand and prices for signed Muhammad Ali memorabilia. History It could be said that collecting sports memorabilia goes back to the first decades of the 20th century, when many people would collect baseballs from baseball games and many asked Babe Ruth for autographs. As years passed and many other sports stars joined their sports, memorabilia collectors also began to broaden their horizons. When the NBA, MLB, NHL and NFL began selling their jerseys in stores during the 1980s, game used jerseys also became a hot item among sports memorabilia collectors. Former NBA player Dennis Rodman was famous for taking off his jerseys and throwing them to the stands after his games were over. Michael Jordan is probably the basketball player whose memorabilia is most sought after by collectors. The highest price fetched for a football (soccer) match worn shirt is $224,000. The shirt belonged to the legendary Pel√©, who wore it during the 1970 World Cup final in which Brazil went on to win. Popular items Collectors like to look back in time when they are finding sports memorabilia. Items such as John L. Sullivan and Jack Johnson fight posters have sold well before. There is also a boxing glove signed by Sullivan, Johnson, Ruth and many Hollywood stars and American Presidents that has sold for a lot of money before. This glove is now on display at the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Other popular items in sports memorabilia are \\"game-used\\" items. Game used can refer to an item worn on the field during a game, worn during the pregame, or by a player on the bench. These can include jerseys, pants, caps, helmets, gloves, shoes, or even sunglasses. Game Used can also refer to bats, balls, turf, flags, or other items used by a player on in the stadium. In NASCAR, and other forms of automobile racing, the metal from the cars, the tires, the driver uniforms, and the crew uniforms are popular collectables. Concrete from the various racetracks are also popular. Trunks (shorts or pants), used by popular boxers such as Greg Haugen in boxing fights are also popular and sometimes sell for 100 dollars or more. In Europe, football (soccer) memorabilia is the largest market, with high-profile players shirts, boots and photos in demand. Event programmes from rugby union and football (soccer) matches are also highly collectable.

The program has been conducted each summer since 1971, with the exceptions of 1981, 1996, and has more than 1500 alumni. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 Summer Studies ran online for a shortened program of four weeks. The program was created and is still headed by Professor David C. Kelly. Background The program is housed at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and generally runs for six weeks from early July until mid- August. The program itself consists of lectures, study sessions, math workshops (general-knowledge classes), maxi-courses (three-week classes run by the senior staff members), and mini-courses (specialized shorter classes). On a typical day, students spend four hours in the morning in class, have lunch together with the faculty, and then have several hours to use at their leisure. During this \\"down time\\" students and faculty members often host quasis, where they participate in an activity as a small group, such as juggling or making sushi. They return for the \\"Prime Time Theorem\\" (an hour- long talk on an interesting piece of mathematics given by a faculty member or a visitor), have dinner, and then spend three hours in a problem solving session. One of the instructors blogged the content of her class. Many students go on to professional careers in mathematics. An occasional publicationFor instance, has resulted from work done at the program. Well- known alumni of the program include two MacArthur Fellows, Eric Lander and Erik Winfree, as well as Lisa Randall, Dana Randall, and Eugene Volokh. Many alumni return to the campus for a few days around Yellow Pig's Day (July 17) of each year. This observance was formalized for 2006 in \\"Yellow Pig Math Days,\\" which was conducted in observance of 2006 being the 34th offering of the HCSSiM Program (34 being a multiple of 17).

Free Flight is the original form of hobby aeromodeling, with the competitive objective being to build and launch a self controlling aircraft that will consistently achieve the longest flight duration over multiple competition rounds, within various class parameters.  Description  The essence of free-flight is that the aircraft have no need for external control, for instance by radio. Aircraft of this type have been flown for over two centuries. They are designed to be inherently stable in flight; if disturbed by a gust of wind or a thermal current they will return automatically to stable flight. Their stability is achieved by a combination of design and trim, - the relationship between the government of gravity, wing and tailplane incidence and rudder setting. With their much lower wing loading, free-flight aircraft fly much more slowly than the engine-powered radio-controlled aircraft that many people first think of when ‚Äòmodel aircraft‚Äô is mentioned. Most of them glide at little more than Sprinting pace and few weigh more than 500 grams. Usually the sole objective of free-flight competition is flight duration, and one of the sport‚Äôs fascinations and challenges is to design the most efficient mincraft within the various competition limits on parameters such as minimum weight, maximum ping pong area, and motive power.  Types  Free flight models may be broadly divided into four categories:F.A.I. Aeromodeling Sporting Code * Gliders (towline and hand-launched) * Rubber-powered (pure duration, and scale with duration) * Power (CO2, Methanol-fueled glow engine, or electric) * Indoor (pure duration, and scale with duration) F1A Towing When flown competitively, the usual aim is maximum flight duration. In the case of models flown outdoors, the modeler attempts to launch the model into rising column of air, a thermal. These outdoor free flight models tend to be designed for two very different flying modes: climbing rapidly under power or tow, and gliding slowly while circling with minimum fall rate. Much of the challenge in designing and flying these models is to maintain aerodynamic stability in both modes and to make a smooth transition between them. Modern models use mechanical or electronic timers to move control surfaces at preset times. Detecting the thermal into which to launch is vital and can involve several methods, ranging from radio telemetered temperature and windspeed measurements plotted on a chart recorder to Mylar streamers or soap bubbles to visualize the rising air. 2007 FAI Free Flight World Championships in Odessa, Ukraine Because competitions normally involve up to seven rounds during the day, each flown to a maximum flight time hard to achieve without thermal assistance; an automatic on-board timeswitch upsets the trim of the aircraft when the \\"max\\" is achieved, to bring the aircraft down safely and quickly. Locating and recovering the aircraft for further flights is an important part of free- flight. Many aircraft carry radio location beacons, and flyers will use GPS, binoculars, a compass and a directionally sensitive radio tracking receiver to assist them. A day's flying and retrieval may well involve or so on foot or on bike, depending on wind strength. Models flown indoors do not depend on rising air currents, but they must be designed for maximum flight efficiency, because of the limited energy stored in the rubber or electric power source. Within each category, there are different classes. Typically, there is a F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) world-championship class, a so-called mini class, an open class, and possibly any number of national or unofficial classes, for which regional or national competitions may be held. Within the competition classification codes specified by the FAI, free flight aeromodeling gets the generic code of F1, where the \\"F\\" stands for flying model aircraft in general, with the \\"1\\" standing specifically for free flight models.  Gliders  Gliders have no onboard motive power. The only energy inputs are the launch, and rising air encountered during the flight. During launch many gliders withstand 60G or more, far more than any manned aircraft is stressed to and launch speeds of sometimes over 140 km/h which energy is then converted to altitude ; this has only become possible since the advent of composite materials such as carbon (graphite), fiberglass, and Kevlar, which are used extensively in many of their structures. F1B Launch The FAI glider class is F1A, also known as A/2 or Nordic glider. The model must have a projected area (wing and stabilizer) of between 32-34 dm2, and a minimum weight of 410 g. Launch is by hand tow, using a tow line of 50 m length, similar to towing a kite. During the tow phase, the glider can be controlled by letting it glide in tight circles followed by towing it up against the wind. Once the decision is taken to launch the model, the sportsman runs to make the model gain speed. When the model is at maximum speed overhead, the tow line is released and a mechanism frees the tow line from the model which then starts a pre-programmed pattern to convert speed into altitude. Modern F1A gliders can gain sometimes as much as 70 meters of additional altitude. The mini glider class is A/1 (F1H). A/1 gliders must have less than 18 dm2 total area, and weigh at least 220 g. Open glider contests are rarely flown, and most competitors in such contests use F1A gliders. Other glider classes include magnet-steered (F1E) gliders - essentially a free flight slope soaring class, and hand-launched glider (usually abbreviated HLG, and also widely known as simply chuck glider). HLGs are small models which are launched from level ground simply by being thrown hard. This is one of the more athletic of the free flight disciplines.  Rubber Powered  Rubber-powered models are powered by the stored energy of a twisted elastic material. These range from the simple rubber-band powered toys available in many toy stores, up to the open rubber class, examples of which often use 200 g of rubber in their \\"motor\\". Rubber does not produce a constant power output; when fully wound a rubber motor produces its maximum torque, but this drops rapidly at first before 'plateauing', finally declining again, after which the propeller stops. Using this initial burst efficiently is vital, and automatic variable-pitch propellers help here, together with timer-operated changes of wing and tailplane incidence and of rudder setting. At the end of the power run the blades fold back alongside the fuselage to minimise drag during the glide. P-30 at stooge The FAI rubber class is F1B, also known as Wakefield. Charles Dennis Rushing has written on the history of the Wakefield Cup. F1B models may have a maximum of 30 g of rubber motor, and the empty weight of the airframe must be at least 200 g. The maximum total area of the model must be less than 19 dm2. The mini rubber class is Coupe d'Hiver (also known as F1G). \\"Coupe\\" models have no area restrictions. The maximum weight of rubber allowed is 10 g, and the minimum empty weight of the airframe is 70g. . Open rubber is a popular event, featuring large models with enormous amounts of rubber crammed into them. Open models often have 50% of their flying weight composed of rubber. The F1D (see #Indoor below) is a class of delicate, lightweight, slow- flying, long-duration (over 30 minutes) rubber-powered aircraft designed to be flown in a large indoor space. P-30 is a common beginner's event. A P-30 must use an unmodified commercially available plastic propeller. P-30 has a maximum wingspan and overall length of 30 inches (76.2 cm), and uses maximum 10 g of rubber. The empty airframe must weigh at least 40 g. The Wright Stuff competition in Science OIympiad is also very popular. The rules and dimension restrictions vary every year, but many notable fliers such as Brett Sanborn started in Science Olympiad. Planes for this competition usually consist of a balsa frame with a mylar-covered wing and a commercially available fixed-pitch propeller. The rubber motor is typically wound with a 15:1 winder. F1C Model by Eugene Verbitsky (WC). Note the folding wings The most well known beginner rubber powered models are the AMA Cub (also known in the USA as the \\"AMA Delta Dart\\"), Denny Dart, Canarsie Canarie and Squirrel. They are commonly used in workshops or for beginners to learn about construction and flying. The Squirrel, designed by Darcy Whyte is the easiest to build. Free plans are available for download for a Squirrel. The smallest rubber powered model aircraft was built in 1931 by a Philadelphia high school student, called the Flying Flea and was one and a quarter inches long and could remain airborne for approximately one minute.\\"Tiny Model Plane Flies For One-Minute\\", May 1931, Popular Mechanics bottom-left page 813  Power  Power models are those with an onboard power source which is not a rubber motor. Frequently this is an internal combustion engine, and the engine run is limited, typically to just five seconds. Designing an aircraft which climbs as high as possible, with minimum drag at a low lift coefficient, but then must convert to a slow flying glider, is a challenge unique in aviation. However, the category also includes compressed gas motors and electric power. The FAI power class is F1C. F1C models are equipped with an internal combustion engine of up to 2.5cc and need to weight at least 300 g per 1cc (i.e. minimum weight of a 2.5cc equipped model is 750 g). These engines are usually custom made for optimal power output and often yield at more than 30,000 RPM. Many F1C models feature folding wings, to minimize the aerodynamic drag during the climb phase. Another type of powered free flight models is CO2 (its FAI category is F1K ). These models fly using a small engine powered by carbon dioxide. This models are very light. The amount of CO2 is limited to 2 cm¬≥, which is enough for cca. 2 minutes of flight. Another popular free flight Class is FAI category F1J which is similar to F1C however the engines are 1cc displacement or less. FAI rule book. These models use engines like the Profi, and other specialized manufactured engines from Russia and Europe. Sport free flight fliers also use small internal combustion engines and electric motors free flight scale models.  Indoor  As the name suggests, indoor models are designed to fly indoors. These models are typically very light in weight because they do not have to withstand external weather conditions. There are a number of classes of indoor free flight models. Some are scale reproductions but others are designed purely to fly for as long as possible. These models are timed with a stopwatch. F1D model in flight The FAI is the international organising body for all air sports worldwide, including aeromodelling. The FAI sanctions World and European Championships for the ultimate indoor duration class designated F1D. F1D models must have a minimum weight of 1.4 grams and a maximum wing span of 55 cm. These models are constructed from light balsa sheet and strip, boron filament, carbon fibre, and a transparent covering of plastic film less than 0.5 micrometres thick. The models are powered by 0.4 grams of rubber in a single loop about 9.0 inches long that can be wound to take around 1500 turns. The average propeller RPM during a flight is less than 50 and these models fly at less than walking pace. F1D models require a large space, such as a sports hall, aircraft or dirigible hangar, with the famous atrium of the West Baden Springs Hotel having been previously used for indoor free flight competitions in the United States, and there is even a salt mine in Romania underground that has hosted the FAI world F1D championships several times. Single flight times approach forty minutes. Although most other indoor model aircraft are also rubber-powered, gliders and aircraft powered by compressed gas or electric batteries are also flown indoors. Some classes concentrate on scale or semi-scale replicas of man-carrying aircraft. Others feature unusual flight configurations, such as ornithopters, helicopters or autogiros. Indoor modelling is now about a century old. A history of indoor models may be found here.  Old Timers  Sanctioned in the United States by the Society of Antique Modelers , and by a growing number of \\"SAM\\" organization chapters around the world (as well as similar national clubs in some nations) so-called \\"Old Timer\\" free flight model aircraft, which can be gliders, rubber powered or engine powered models, are flyable reproductions of free flight model aircraft designs that generally originated from anywhere in the world, any time before the US involvement in World War II began in 1941-42. Scaling of the size (enlargement or reduction) of these designs are permitted for most of the event types in SAM competition, with a few specialized categories existing for reproduction models that mandate the models be built in their original size only. Hawker Hurricane designer Sydney Camm as a young man, with a \\"twin-pusher\\" free flight model, circa 1915 in England, a type flown today in \\"old-timer\\" meets In the United Kingdom, models built to plans or kits published before January 1951 are categorised as vintage and those subsequently but prior to 1960 are categorised as classic. Jim Arnott holds Winding Boy, a classic rubber model designed by Urlan Wannop. Jim Arnott with Winding Boy Low-pressure, enjoyable competitions for these models generally follow the modern competition formats, with special categories for these early-design models that re-create the model aircraft events actually held before WWII, and even the \\"old-timer\\" movement has seriously begin to embrace electric-powered versions of designs originally built for the two-stroke gasoline-fueled engines of pre-WWII free flight aeromodelling. Actual pre-WW II vintage gasoline-fueled model engines, or authentically operational reproductions of them, are even used on some of the engine-powered designs, and a substantial interest exists in so-called \\"RC Assist\\" old timer free flight models within the SAM organization, which takes the engine powered designs of that era, powers them with more modern two and four stroke glow engines or brushless electric motors instead, and adds rudder, elevator and engine control from a radio control transmitter, just as would be done in the regular RC hobby. Old Timer free flight aircraft specifications, competition rules and guidelines are available from the SAM organization online.  Scale rubber  Rubber scale models replicate full- scale aircraft. Scale documentation is used at contests to check the accuracy and compliance of the model to the full-scale aircraft modeled. Most rubber scale models are in the 20‚Äù to 30‚Äù wingspan range. Exceptions are for \\"Peanut Scale\\" class models, with a maximum 13‚Äù wingspan and \\"Jumbo Scale\\" class models, with 36‚Äù or greater wingspan. The models are powered with loops of rubber matched to the weight of the model and the diameter and pitch of the propeller. The length of the loops often exceed twice the length of the fuselage of the model. The flying duration of the scale model is greatly increased because of the number of windings that can be made on such a long loop of rubber with multiple strands. A mechanical winder is used and the rubber is stretched up to fives times original length to pack in maximum winds on the motor. In flight, these models look just like the real thing. All that is missing is the noise of the engine in the original airplane. Experts can achieve spectacular flights from obscure designs such as the Wright brothers original and Bleriot‚Äôs channel crosser, to one-of-a-kind Depression era homebuilts and modern day experimental aircraft.

It is a roman √† clef (a work of fiction based on real people and events) about Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992. It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1998. The book has been compared to two other novels about American politics: Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men (1946) and O: A Presidential Novel (2011). Klein was identified as the author several months after its publication. He wrote a sequel, The Running Mate in 2000, focusing on Primary Colors character Charlie Martin. Plot summary The book begins as an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton, joins the presidential campaign of southern governor Jack Stanton, a thinly disguised stand-in for Bill Clinton. The plot then follows the primary election calendar beginning in New Hampshire where Stanton's affair with Cashmere, his wife's hairdresser, and his participation in a Vietnam War era protest come to light and threaten to derail his presidential prospects. In Florida, Stanton revives his campaign by disingenuously portraying his Democratic opponent as insufficiently pro-Israel and as a weak supporter of Social Security. Burton becomes increasingly disillusioned with Stanton, who is a policy wonk who talks too long, eats too much and is overly flirtatious toward women. Stanton is also revealed to be insincere in his beliefs, saying whatever will help him to win. Matters finally come to a head, and Burton is forced to choose between idealism and realism.  Identity of the author  An early reviewer opined that the author wished to remain unknown because \\"Anonymity makes truthfulness much easier\\". Later commentators called the publishing of the book under an anonymous identity an effective marketing strategy that produced more publicity for the book, and thus more sales, without calling into question the author's actual inside knowledge. Several people, including former Clinton speechwriter David Kusnet, believed the style of writing had similarities to that of Klein. This was also supported by a quantitative stylometric analysis of the book by Vassar professor Donald Foster.Author Unknown by Gavin McNett Salon November 2, 2000 Klein initially denied writing the book and publicly condemned Foster. Klein denied authorship again in Newsweek, speculating that another writer wrote it. Washington Post Style editor David von Drehle, in an interview, asked Klein if he was willing to stake his journalistic credibility on his denial, to which Klein agreed. In July 1996, after The Washington Post published the results of a handwriting analysis of notes made on an early manuscript of the book, Klein finally admitted that he was \\"Anonymous\\". Reception The New York Daily News described the book as a farce and praised it as funny, truthful, and as containing \\"uncannily accurate\\" portraits of its thinly disguised characters. The book was #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list for fiction, for nine weeks in 1996.

In industrialized countries, a griddle is most commonly a flat metal plate, elsewhere typically a brick slab or tablet. A residential griddle may be composed of chrome steel, aluminum, or carbon steel. The vast majority of commercial grade griddles are made from A36 steel, though some are stainless steel or composites of stainless and aluminum. Almost all residential and commercial griddles are heated directly or indirectly by flame or electrical elements. Traditional Cooking flatbread on a griddle Traditional griddles include a stone or brick slab or tablet, and a shallow platter filled with sand. The former are usually heated to cooking temperature before the food is placed on them, the latter heated after. In Latin America one traditional style of griddle is a budare. Made from stone or clay, it is used to cook a variety of flatbreads, such as tortilla, arepa and casabe. Modern versions for commercial use are metal and called comals. The metal griddle is usually made of chrome steel, aluminium or stainless steel. Metal griddles originally were a flat metal surface for frying suspended from hooks over a campfire or fireplace. Later versions were sometimes integrated into the tops of wood-fired cookstoves as a removable iron plate, and later as a separate, typically handle-less plate covering one or more burners on a gas or electric stove. The traditional Scottish griddle (or girdle) has a flat wrought iron disk with an upturned rim to which a semicircular hoop handle is attached, allowing it to be suspended over the fire from a central chain and hook. Girdles are used for cooking scones, bannocks, pancakes and oatcakes. The traditional Welsh bakestone is similar, circular with a one-piece handle, typically cast iron, in thickness. It is used to cook Welsh cakes, pikelets, and crepes. Residential alt=A basic electric griddle with temperature control In residential applications a griddle may be composed of stainless steel, wrought iron, aluminum or carbon steel typically 1/16 to 1/8-inch (1.6 to 3.2mm) thick. Portable electric units with limited temperature control are most common, often with Teflon or other stick-resistant coatings. These units are highly portable and suitable for light-duty cooking. Portable griddle plates are commonly used on one or more gas or electric cooking zones (a single zone unit may be considered a \\"frying pan\\"). Premium brand residential ranges offer griddle top options as well, which look much like those on commercial grade ranges. Commercial Commercial-grade griddles may be either free-standing countertop equipment that sits on a stand or base, or part of a larger piece of equipment such as a restaurant range. Most units are , in increments of . All have three components: a plate, heat source, and temperature control. Performance, such as time to heat, temperature consistency/evenness, recovery time, and productivity (pounds of food per hour), reflects how they are combined. Each of these primary characteristics can dramatically affect the performance of the overall unit, with the distinguishing feature being a large, flat, cook surface. Some foods are cooked or scorched using a dry heat, but the most common technique is shallow frying, where an item is either cooked in a relatively thin film of added oil or its own renderings. Leftover fat and residual debris are scraped off into a trough, most commonly in front but also on the side and rear, thence through a chute into a can or tray. Commercial griddles typically have ‚Äúsplashes‚Äù, vertical metal shields that catch flying fat and prevent items from being pushed off. It is difficult to distinguish on sight a basic griddle from one with more sophisticated construction and dramatically superior performance. Manufacturer specification sheets provide particulars. =Plate material= The vast majority of commercial grade griddles are made from A36 steel from thick, though some are composed of stainless steel or even composites of aluminum and stainless steel of varying thicknesses. Griddle plate depth (front-to-back) is typically 24-inches (610mm), though compact units may be as shallow as , and deep units can be up to in depth. Typical commercial gas griddles have plates between 3/4 and 1-inch thick (19 to 25mm). Electric griddle plates are typically thinner, from thick, to reduce the response lag between the control and plate surface common in such designs (less material improves heat transfer time). U-shaped griddle burner Because most commercial griddle plates are made from the same material the heat transfer characteristics of a griddle plate can commonly be inferred from its geometry. A carbon steel plate heated by an array of U-shaped or H-shaped burners does not distribute heat in a perfectly even pattern, even if all thermostats are set to the same temperature and are perfectly calibrated. As a result, temperature 'islands' can develop on the griddle plate surface, resulting in measurable hot and cold spots that can affect griddle performance. Composite Composite griddle plate material Composite plate material can be a combination of any two dissimilar metals to optimize heat transfer characteristics and improve griddle performance. A common variant of this construction, currently available, involves a core of aluminum laminated with type 304 stainless steel on either side. The heat transfer rate of aluminum is five times that of carbon steel, which maximizes heat transfer from the bottom of the plate to the cooking surface, and facilitates an even temperature distribution over the entire plate surface regardless of heat source. Type 304 stainless steel is medical grade, with a low level of porosity that reduces the penetration of cooking products into the surface, which causes sticking and flavor transfer ‚Äì important performance metrics for commercial applications. This tends to significantly improve surface cleaning characteristics, especially in a commercial cooking environment, which can reduce cleaning labor and the need for consumable cleaning products. Because aluminum is only one third the weight of steel, griddles manufactured with an aluminum/stainless steel composite material tend to be substantially lighter, which facilitates installation and movement of the griddle. Chrome Chrome plating is a relatively common variation on surface finish for commercial griddles. The finish is aesthetically pleasing, but offers additional benefits to griddle operators. In its plated form, chrome is non- porous, impermeable and non-reactive (inert) with food products, which limits food sticking during the cooking process and facilitates cleaning, as well as reduced flavor transfer between foods. The mirror finish of a chrome finish reduces heat transmission to the environment due to the low surface emissivity, a characteristic common to most highly polished surfaces. Chrome surfaces can be damaged by cleaning with abrasives and sharp or hardened metal utensils common in commercial cooking environments, so special spatulas, brushes and cleansers are recommended for the operation and maintenance of these products. If damage does occur to the chrome surface, food acids tend to penetrate and dissolve the metal substrate beneath the chrome coating, causing it to spall off. Chrome griddles can be cleaned with soapy water and a palmetto bristle brush. Metal scrapers and abrasives should be explicitly avoided, as they tend to damage the surface and permanently cloud the mirror finish. Special cleaning agents and powders specifically for use on chrome surfaces are also available. Chrome plating can be done by two different methods, where the source of the deposited metal is either in the form of hexavalent chromium or trivalent chromium. Hexavalent chrome plating baths have a long history for producing heavy, corrosion resistant and mechanically hard coatings. However, the process is slow, varies in thickness according to the shape of the object, and produces extremely toxic waste. Plating from trivalent baths is commonly used for thinner, decorative finishes. It can be faster, more uniform, and with lower disposal costs but requires more careful controls during the process. Heavy chrome plating, known as \\"hard chrome\\" from hexavalent baths, is the more common form used on commercial griddles. As plating thickness is increased, the surface finish of the underlying steel must be smoother, as the plating does not have a leveling effect.. Also because chrome plating is so hard (65 to 69 Rockwell scale), it is subject to damage if the underlying surface deforms during impacts from metal spatulas or pots and pans. Consequently, a quenched and tempered alloy steel such as A514 is frequently used for commercial cooking applications. That type of steel has three times the yield strength of common structural steel such as A36 which might otherwise be used for griddles. Grooved surfaces Grooved griddle with scraper Grooved griddle surfaces are a common plate modification for commercial applications. Typically done to allow a sufficiently hot griddle to create branding marks similar to what might be found on a grill, but without the need to maintain two pieces of equipment for that purpose. The geometry of the grooves is typically unique for each manufacturer, and tapered from the back of the griddle plate towards the front to facilitate the drainage of grease and other fluids. Effective cleaning of a grooved griddle can be performed with a wire or palmetto bristle brush, and many manufacturers provide a custom scraper designed to fit the geometry of the groove pattern. Griddles can be partially or fully grooved according to the needs of the customer, though extra care needs to be exercised when applied to griddles with embedded thermostats where the web thickness between the thermostat slot and top-side groove could result in breakthrough of the plate material. =Heat source= For either countertop or range-top two versions the primary heating methods for the plates are through either direct gas-fired flame (natural gas and propane are typical), or via high-powered electrical elements. While gas-fired appliances are typically acknowledged to have faster response and more control, these characteristics are a function both of the heat source and the plate material. Plate material with a sufficiently high heat transfer coefficient can exceed the performance of a steel plate heated by gas, even if heated by electrical elements. Gas Gas griddles are by far the most common, due to the ready availability of natural and propane gas in commercial cooking environments, and are preferred for their rapid heat-up and more consistent temperatures. Gas burners will tend to heat the plate more evenly as a film of hot gases will cover the entire bottom plate surface. Typical griddles use between , linear measure. Electric Electric griddles are typically made of a thinner plate material than a similar gas griddle to improve the heat transfer between the bottom-mounted elements and the cooking surface. Elements used to heat the griddle are typically linear measure, and made from round rod sheathed in a suitable allow such as incoloy, whose geometry is designed to optimize temperature distribution across the plate. The round elements have a tangential point of contact with the griddle plate and are commonly held in place by a clamping bracket or plate. More than one element per linear foot is common, and an array of these elements is required to heat a griddle plate of any given width. Electric griddles tend to be less expensive than a gas unit of similar size, due largely to the reduced plate thickness, but also the generally lower cost of construction and reduced sophistication of most electric griddle control systems. Though they tend to lag their gas counterparts in productive capacity, an advantage to electric griddle construction is the relative simplicity of the system that tends to limit failure modes and can result in long life expectancy for these products. The lack of hot effluent gases can significantly reduce kitchen heat loads, and reduce overall kitchen system costs by exchanging a major gas heat source for an appliance with lower hood requirements. Rates for gas and electric utilities can be used to balance the cost of ownership decision in an appliance purchase, as some geographic areas have a combination of higher natural gas prices and lower electric prices that may make electrical appliances a more effective choice. =Temperature control= Depending on the application a griddle may have either manual gas control or one of several types of thermostat in both gas and electric griddles. These control types have different performance characteristics based on the heat source, mounting, plate material and material thickness, and cannot be considered in isolation when making performance decisions. Thermostatic Thermal cycling of common griddle thermostat controls Thermostats are used to regulate the griddle surface around a temperature set point established by the operator to optimize cooking time and food quality while avoiding overcooking, burning food, or smoking oil. Ranges of operation can vary depending on the controls used and the construction of the griddle, but is most common. Other than solid state controls, which are very sensitive across their entire range of control, snap-action and modulating (aka ‚Äì throttling) thermostats have peak sensitivity across the middle two-thirds of their operating range. This can limit their overall performance at the low end of their temperature spectrum (at or below ). This is due to the nature of the temperature control mechanism, which consists of a fluid-filled bulb (typically an oil) connected to the thermostat control via a long narrow capillary tube. The fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature, activating a control response from the thermostat. There is a time lag between sensing the temperature change from the surface of the griddle plate to the response of the fluid within the bulb, to the thermostat control and turning the heat source on or off, up or down. This lag is referred to as hysteresis, and is a primary aspect of recovery time ‚Äì an important griddle performance metric. Most commercial griddles have a single thermostat control for every of unit width, though some may have only one thermostat for every . This construction technique reduces unit cost by limiting the number of expensive control elements, but at the expense of performance and zone control. The thermostat control will not react quickly (if at all) to a surface load that is not relatively close to the probe, whether embedded or bottom mounted, resulting in less control and wider temperature variations on the cooking surface. Many griddle-cooked food portions are or less in diameter, meaning the distance from probe to the center of a load can average up to ‚Äì a very long distance for heat transfer in steel. =Bottom-mounted versus embedded= Embedded thermostat on a griddle Bottom-mounted thermostat on a griddle Specification sheet descriptions (or not) of thermostat type and mounting Reduction of the hysteresis in a griddle system is typically the difference between lower priced griddles and higher performing models, and can be accomplished through a combination of plate material, geometry, temperature controls and control location relative to the plate surface. Because thermostat mounting is internal to griddle construction it is necessary to compare of specification sheets for different griddle models, or griddles produced by different manufacturers, to determine which technique was used for a given griddle. The most common construction for countertop griddle and range-top griddle thermostat applications is to fasten the bulb to the bottom of the griddle plate and protect the bulb from direct contact from the heating element (gas or electric) so that it can sense the change in the plate temperature. This is referred to as a ‚Äúbottom mounted‚Äù thermostat, and discounting the control type, will result in the longest response time due to the thickness of the material. In general, if no mention is made of thermostat mounting or proximity to the griddle surface, the thermostat is bottom mounted. A common technique to reduce the time-to-response of a thermostat is to mill a slot into the bottom side of a griddle plate and ‚Äúembed‚Äù the thermostat bulb in closer proximity to the griddle surface. This construction reduces the thermostat response time in approximate proportion to the distance to the griddle surface. Specification sheets or product literature will indicate embedded construction through use of key words like ‚Äòembedded‚Äô or indicate a specific probe proximity to the plate surface that is less than the plate thickness. =Solid state= Solid state probe Thermostat Solid state probe mounted in a composite griddle plate Solid-state controls are used in gas and electric applications at the high range of the performance and cost spectrum. Composed of two parts, the sensor probe and the control box, solid state thermostats are the most precise control available for griddle operation. The probe consists of two thermocouple wires mounted in a protective capillary tube body that is mounted (typically threaded) into the griddle plate material at a location near the center of the heating element being controlled. When a temperature variation is detected the probe sends an electrical signal to the control box, which consists of an electrical circuit board that then activates or deactivates the burner system. This control system can respond almost instantly to temperature changes on the griddle surface, which provides a far superior temperature control response to the fluid filled capillary bulb found in Modulating and Snap Action thermostats. Temperature consistency to set point of +/- 5F is typical. Temperature consistency across a griddle surface can be tightly controlled using this type of thermostat, making it ideal for high production environments where product uniformity and consistency are critical, as much for ease of operation as food quality. Owing to the electronic components, controls of this type are much more expensive than simpler, more mechanical systems. They are also more sensitive to grease and water infiltration that can damage the sensitive electronic components, and tend to have a lower temperature threshold, making insulation and ventilation more important in the griddle design. Surface temperatures for griddles using solid state thermostats are typically limited to for this reason. =Snap-action= Mechanical snap action thermostat valve Electric snap Action thermostat with solenoid valve Snap action thermostats are the most common control used in heavy duty commercial griddles with medium-to-heavy production demands. These controls are called ‚Äúsnap action‚Äù because the control mechanism will turn the burner valve or electrical element fully on or completely off, with no modulation or intermediate heat source operation ‚Äì effectively ‚Äòsnapping‚Äô the heat source on or off. While not as responsive as solid state controls, snap action controls can maintain a griddle surface temperature within +/- 15 ¬∞F (8 ¬∞C) of set point if the thermostat bulb is embedded assuming a 1-inch (25mm) thick steel plate. This operating temperature range may be pushed to +/- 20 to 25 ¬∞F (10 ¬∞C to 13 ¬∞C) if the probe is bottom mounted due to the additional thermal hysteresis introduced by the plate material. Snap action control systems are often run with electricity, where a stand-alone thermostat acting as a switch is activated by the capillary bulb fluid. The thermostat switches an electrical signal on-or-off to an associated solenoid valve, controlling gas flow to the burner. This construction allows integration of other control mechanisms into the system, such as pilot flame failure, but requires the use of components known to be sensitive to high temperatures and water damage. Solenoids and associated wiring are known to degrade over time, even if operating within their design parameters, due to the cumulative effects of thermal cycling and ambient grease and oil coating their surfaces ‚Äì environmental aspects known to attack the integrity of plastics. Mechanical snap action thermostat valves are the integration of the control mechanism with the flow control valve. These devices have the same performance characteristics of the electrical system counterpart, but without the need for electrical wiring and the associated caveats. Pilot safety protection can also be integrated into control systems that utilize these devices, which can result in a wholly mechanical alternative to the electrical system. Appropriately designed, mechanical system are less sensitive to heat, water and grease infiltration, and so allow for a higher operating temperature range; up to . =Modulating= Modulating (throttling) thermostat Modulating thermostat bypass adjustment screw The modulating thermostat, also referred to as the throttling thermostat, is the most basic thermostat control offered in the commercial griddle market and is typically found in lower priced griddles where some control is necessary but performance is not critical. It offers the advantage of being a mechanical system that doesn't require electric power, which simplifies design and reduces overall unit cost. In this particular style of control the fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature and slowly actuates an internal diaphragm which controls gas flow to the burner. One drawback to this control is long response time, which causes the overall control to overshoot and undershoot the temperature target by as much as 40 ¬∞F (22 ¬∞C). For example, at a set point of , the griddle surface temperature over the probe can range from . Another important aspect of this control is the bypass flame setting, which allows gas to bypass the control of the thermostat diaphragm and allows the burner to operate irrespective of thermostat set point. If the bypass setting is too high and the griddle plate is not being cooled by cooking loads, the surface temperature of the griddle can drift well beyond the thermostatic set point. Manual Manual gas control valve Griddles with manual controls require constant attention by an operator to control the temperature of the griddle plate. Without food products to remove the heat from a griddle surface, the unregulated heat source can cause the plate surface temperature to rise continuously until it levels out at temperatures well beyond those normally used for cooking (over ). At these temperatures the griddle plate material may take on a bluish tint as the surface of the carbon steel plate oxidizes. Manual controls are not typically used on electric griddles. Commercial applications for griddles using manual controls are varied, but often include menus that call for scorching proteins such as chicken or steak, or dry cooking products such as buns or tortillas. A common variation on griddles using this control is to have the surface of the griddle grooved in such a way that allows for the food product to retain grill marks, much as may be made when cooking on a charbroiler. A common side effect associated with the unregulated temperatures of these griddle products is for the front rail of the griddle plate (sometimes called a ‚Äúbullnose‚Äù) to become exceptionally hot - often well in excess of surface temperature criteria outlined in UL 197 Section 50.2. This area of the griddle is open to casual contact by an operator, and can often lead to burns on unprotected skin. Some manufacturers have incorporated unique designs, sometimes called ‚Äúcool bullnose technology‚Äù, to minimize temperature excess in this zone and reduce the potential for operator injury. =Accessories= Commercial griddle with plate rail accessory There are many variations on the standard griddle, and accessories abound. Examples include stainless steel cabinets, refrigerated bases, adjustable legs, belly bars, and even cutting boards, to name a few. Cleaning accessories include such items as griddle scrapers and squeegees. Commercial griddles can often be purchased with a variety of accessories, many of which are customized to the construction and manufacturer. Plate rails, condiment rails for holding standard kitchen pans (1/6 pan size is common), and cutting boards are among the most common. Safety Some gas griddles come equipped with a flame-failure safety device, but like many pieces of kitchen equipment, griddles can pose a fire hazard if not properly maintained. Care needs to be taken to keep the griddle and the area around it free of grease buildup. Splash guards at the edges of the griddle can help prevent grease from escaping to the surrounding workspace, and emptying the grease trough often helps prevent grease overflow. Additionally, because portable griddles are easily moved from one location to another, care must always be used to ensure that there is sufficient clearance between the griddle location and combustible materials. Also, common household griddles should not be located in a place where the heat control of the appliance would be accessible to children and others unfamiliar with the griddle's operation. Commercial griddles are often required to have pilot protection (also known as ‚Äúflame safety‚Äù) to prevent the unregulated flow of gas if the griddle pilot burners are somehow extinguished. This protection system can be electro-mechanical in nature, electrical, or electronic. All of these systems detect the presence of a pilot flame through a proximity sensor, which then allows or disallows gas flow to the burner valves based on the signal. Valves cannot then allow gas to flow to the burners if there is no pilot burner to ignite the gas, mitigating a safety hazard.

Advancements in data collection methods, analytics, digital electronics, and digital economics, have enabled marketers to deploy more effective real-time and prolonged customer experience personalization tactics. Beginning in the early 1990s, web developers began tracking HTML calls that their websites were receiving from online visitors. In 2012, the Web Analytics Association (WAA) officially changed its name to the Digital Analytics Association (DAA) in order to accommodate new and developing data streams that exist in addition to the web.  Technology  Personalized marketing is dependent on many different types of technology for data collection, data classification, data analysis, data transfer, and data scalability. Technology enables marketing professionals to collect first-party data such as gender, age group, location, and income and connect them with third-party data like click-through rates of online banner ads and social media participation. Data Management Platforms: A data management platform (DMP) is a centralized computing system for collecting, integrating and managing large sets of structured and unstructured data from disparate sources. Personalized marketing enabled by DMPs, is sold to advertisers with the goal of having consumers receive relevant, timely, engaging, and personalized messaging and advertisements that resonate with their unique needs and wants. Growing number of DMP software options are available including Adobe Systems Audience Manager and Core Audience (Marketing Cloud) to Oracle-acquired BlueKai, Sitecore Experience Platform and X+1 thumb Customer Relationship Management Platforms: Customer relationship management (CRM) is used by companies to manage and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle to improve business relationships with customers, assist in customer retention and drive sales growth. CRM systems are designed to compile information on customers across different channels (points of contact between the customer and the company) which could include the company's website, live support, direct mail, marketing materials and social media. CRM systems can also give customer-facing staff detailed information on customers' personal information, purchase history, buying preferences and concerns. Most popular enterprise CRM applications are Salesforce.com, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, NetSuite, and Oracle Eloqua. Beacon Technology: Beacon technology works on Bluetooth low energy (BLE) which is used by a low frequency chip that is found in devices like mobile phones. These chips communicate with multiple Beacon devices to form a network and are used by marketers to better personalize the messaging and mobile ads based on the customer's proximity to their retail outlet.  Strategies  One-to-one marketing refers to marketing strategies applied directly to a specific consumer. Having knowledge of the consumer's preferences, enables suggesting specific products and promotions to each consumer. One-to-one marketing is based on four main steps in order to fulfill its goals: identify, differentiate, interact, and customize.\\"Is Your Company Ready for One-to-One Marketing?\\" Harvard Business Review, January‚ÄìFebruary 1999, accessed July 27, 2011 #Identify: In this stage, the major concern is to get to know the customers of a company, to collect reliable data about their preferences and how their needs can best be satisfied. #Differentiate: To distinguish the customers in terms of their lifetime value to the company, to know them by their priorities in terms of their needs, and segment them into more restricted groups. #Interact: In this phase, one needs to know by which communication channel and by what means, contact with the client is best made. It is necessary to get the customer's attention by engaging with him/her in ways that are known as being the ones that he/she enjoys the most. #Customize: One needs to personalize the product or service to the customer individually. The knowledge that a company has about a customer, needs to be put into practice and the information held has to be taken into account in order to be able to give the client exactly what he/she wants.  Costs and Benefits  Personalized marketing is used by businesses to engage in personalized pricing which is a form of price discrimination. Personalized marketing is being adopted in one form or another by many different companies because of the benefits it brings for both the businesses and their customers. =Businesses= Before the Internet, it was difficult for businesses to measure the success of their marketing campaigns. A campaign would be launched, and even if there was a change in revenue, it was nearly impossible to determine what impact the campaign had on the change. Personalized marketing allows businesses to learn more about customers based on demographic, contextual, and behavioral data. This behavioral data, as well as being able to track consumers‚Äô habits, allows firms to better determine what advertising campaigns and marketing efforts are bringing customers in and what demographics they are influencing. This allows firms to drop efforts that are ineffective, as well as put more money into the techniques that are bringing in customers. Some personalized marketing can also be automated, increasing the efficiency of a business's marketing strategy. For example, an automated email could be sent to a user shortly after an order is placed, giving suggestions for similar items or accessories that may help the customer better use the product he or she ordered, or a mobile app could send a notification about relevant deals to a customer when he or she is close to a store. =Customers= Consumers face an overwhelming variety and volume of products and services available to purchase. A single retail website can offer thousands of different products, and few have the time or are willing to make the effort to browse through everything retailers have to offer. At the same time, customers expect ease and convenience in their shopping experience. In a recent survey, 74% of consumers said they get frustrated when websites have content, offers, ads, and promotions that have nothing to do with them. Many even expressed that they would leave a site if the marketing on the site was the opposite of their tastes, such as prompts to donate to a political party they dislike, or ads for a dating service when the visitor to the site is married. In addition, the top two reasons customers unsubscribe from marketing emailing lists are 1) they receive too many emails and 2) the content of the emails is not relevant to them. Personalized marketing helps to bridge the gap between the vastness of what is available and the needs of customers for streamlined shopping experience. By providing a customized experience for customers, frustrations of purchase choices may be avoided. Customers may more quickly find what they are looking for and avoid wasting time scrolling through irrelevant content and products. Consumers have come to expect this sort of user experience that caters to their interests, and companies that have created ultra-customized digital experiences, such as Amazon and Netflix.  Future of Personalized Marketing  Personalized marketing is gaining headway and has become a point of popular interest with the emergence of relevant and supportive technologies like DMP, geotargeting, and various forms of social media. Now, many people believe it is the inevitable baseline for the future of marketing strategy and for future business success in competitive markets. Adapt to technology: For personalized marketing to work the way advocates say it will, companies are going to have to adapt to relevant technologies. They will have to get in touch with the new and popular forms of social media, data-gathering platforms, and other technologies that not all current employees and businesses may be familiar with or can afford. Restructuring current business models: Adopting a new marketing system tailored to the most relevant technologies will take time and resources to implement. Organized planning, communication and restructuring within businesses will be required to successfully implement personalized marketing. Some companies will have to accept that their current business and marketing models will change radically, and probably often. They will have to reconsider the ways customer data and information circulate within the company and possibly beyond. Company databases will be flooded with expansive personal information ‚Äì individual's geographic location, potential buyers‚Äô past purchases, etc., and there may be complications regarding how that information is gathered, circulated internally and externally, and used to increase profits. Legal liabilities: To address concerns about sensitive information being gathered and utilized without obvious consumer consent, liabilities and legalities have to be set and enforced. Privacy is always an issue, in some countries more than others, so companies have to manage any legal hurdles before personalized marketing can be adopted.  Controversies  Many people are concerned that companies are using too much personal information to create the personalized marketing used today by businesses. =Use of algorithms= Data is being generated by algorithms, and the algorithms associate preferences with the user's browsing history or personal profiles. Rather than discovering new facts or perspectives when one searches for news, information, or products, one will be presented with similar or adjoining concepts (\\"filter bubble\\"). Some consider this exploitation of existing ideas rather than discovery of new ones. Presenting someone with only personalized content may also exclude other, unrelated news or information that might in fact be useful to the user. Algorithms may also be manipulated. In February 2015, Coca-Cola ran into trouble over an automated, algorithm-generated bot created for advertising purposes. Gawker‚Äôs editorial labs director, Adam Pash, created a Twitter bot @MeinCoke and set it up to tweet lines from Mein Kampf and then link to them with Coca-Cola‚Äôs campaign #MakeItHappy. The result was that for two hours, Coca-Cola‚Äôs Twitter feed was broadcasting big chunks of Adolf Hitler‚Äôs text. In November 2014, the New England Patriots were forced to apologize after an automatic, algorithm-generated bot was tricked into tweeting a racial slur from the official team account.  Internet marketing  Personalized marketing had been most practical in interactive media such as the internet. A web site can track a customer's interests and make suggestions for the future. Many sites help customers make choices by organizing information and prioritizing it based on the individual's liking. In some cases, the product itself can be customized using a configuration system. The business movement during Web 1.0 leveraged database technology for targeting products, ads, and services to specific users with particular profile attributes. The concept was supported by technologies such as BroadVision, ATG, and BEA. Amazon is a classic example of a company that performs \\"One to One Marketing\\" by offering users targeted offers and related products. Personalization is the term that later followed as a way of describing this evolution in Internet marketing. Advancements in data collection and IP targeting technology have enabled marketers to deploy one-to-one marketing to individual buildings or homes using an offline to online strategy, matching customers and their devices online simply by obtaining a physical mailing address.  Other marketing  More recently, personalized marketing, also known as Individual marketing, has become practical for bricks and mortar retailers. The market size, an order of magnitude greater than that of the Internet, demanded a different technological approach now available and in use. Many retailers attract customers to the physical store by offering discounted items which are automatically selected to appeal to the individual recipient. The interactivity occurs through the offer redemptions recorded by the point of sale systems, which can then update each model of the individual shopper. Personalization can be more accurate when based solely upon individual purchasing records because of the simplified and repetitive nature of some bricks and mortar retail purchasing, for example grocery superstores. Don Peppers and Martha Rogers, in their book on the subject, The One to One Future, speak of managing customers rather than products, differentiating customers not just products, measuring share of customer not share of market, and developing economies of scope rather than economies of scale. They also describe personalized marketing as a four phase process: identifying potential customers; determining their needs and their lifetime value to the company; interacting with customers so as to learn about them; and customizing products, services, and communications to individual customers. Some commentators (including Peppers and Rogers) use the term \\"one-to-one marketing\\" which has been misunderstood by some. Seldom is there just one individual on either side of the transaction. Buyer decision processes often involve several people, as do the marketer's efforts. However, the excellent metaphor refers to the objective of a single message source (store) \\"to\\" the single recipient (household), a technological analogy to a \\"mom and pop\\" store on a first-name basis with 10 million customers.

Her media career began in 1980 with the radio show Sexually Speaking, which continued until 1990. She has hosted several series on the Lifetime Channel and other cable television networks from 1984 to 1993 and is the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality.  Early life and education  Westheimer was born Karola Ruth Siegel on June 4, 1928, in Wiesenfeld (now part of Karlstadt am Main), Germany, the only child of Orthodox Jews, Irma (n√©e Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a notions wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked. She was given an early grounding in Judaism by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the Nordend district of Frankfurt, where they lived. Her father was taken away by the Nazis a week after Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938. Westheimer cried while her father was taken away by men in gloss-finished boots, while her grandmother gave the men money and asked them to care for him. Westheimer's mother and grandmother decided that Germany was too dangerous due to the tension and Nazi violence growing, so in January 1939 they sent Westheimer on the Kindertransport to Switzerland. Westheimer, age 11, arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in Heiden and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children there. Westheimer was not allowed to take classes at the local school, but a fellow orphan boy would sneak his textbooks to Westheimer at night so she could learn and continue her education. While at the orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. When the letters ceased in 1941, Westheimer knew she would not hear from them again. The details of her parents' deaths due to the Holocaust are also included in the Hulu documentary about Westheimer titled Ask Dr. Ruth. Her father was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. Her mother was killed during the Holocaust, but there is no specific information about her death, or about how and when she died. In the data base at the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer's mother is categorized by the word verschollen or 'disappeared.' Westheimer decided to emigrate to British- controlled Mandatory Palestine. There, at 17, she \\"first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception.\\" She later told The New York Times that \\"I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.\\"Dullea, Georgia. \\"Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth\\". The New York Times. October 26, 1987. Westheimer joined the Haganah in Jerusalem. Because of her diminutive height of , she was trained as a scout and sniper.Urban Legends Reference Pages: Dr. Ruth Was a Sniper by Barbara Mikkelson, March 1, 2007, Retrieved March 2, 2007. Of this experience, she said, \\"I never killed anybody, but I know how to throw hand grenades and shoot.\\" In 1948, Westheimer was seriously wounded in action by an exploding shell during the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war, and it was several months before she was able to walk again.Foreman, Tom (June 11, 2003). Dr. Ruth: Sex Sage and Ex-Sniper on Global Sexuality. National Geographic. In 1950, Westheimer moved to France, where she studied and then taught psychology at the University of Paris. In 1956, she immigrated to the United States, settling in Washington Heights, Manhattan.\\"Morris, Bob. \\"At Home With: Dr. Ruth Westheimer; The Bible as Sex Manual?\\". The New York Times.

Westheimer earned an M.A. degree in sociology from The New School in 1959 and an Ed.D. degree from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1970. Westheimer became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1965. She regained her German citizenship in 2007 through the German Citizenship Project that enabled descendants of Germans deprived of their citizenship during the Third Reich to reclaim their citizenship without losing the citizenship of their home country.  Early career  After receiving her Ed.D., she briefly worked for Planned Parenthood and this experience encouraged her to continue studying human sexuality. She went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher for Helen Singer Kaplan at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. She continued to work there as an adjunct associate professor for five years. She also taught at Lehman College, Brooklyn College, Adelphi University, Columbia University and West Point.  Media career  Dr. Ruth's media career began in 1980 when her radio show, Sexually Speaking, debuted on WYNY-FM in New York City. She was offered this opportunity after she gave a lecture to New York broadcasters about the need for sex education programming to help deal with issues of contraception and unwanted pregnancies. Betty Elam, the community affairs manager at WYNY, was impressed with her talk and offered Westheimer $25 per week to make Sexually Speaking, which started as a 15-minute show airing every Sunday at midnight. By 1983 her show was the top- rated radio show in the area, and in 1984 NBC Radio began syndicating it nationwide as the Dr. Ruth Show. She went on to produce her radio show until 1990. Described as the \\"Sister Wendy of Sexuality\\", Dr. Ruth helped to revolutionize talk about sex and sexuality on radio and television, and she was noted for having \\"an accent only a psychologist could love\\". She became known for being candid and funny, but respectful, and for her tag phrase \\"Get some\\". One journalist described her unique voice as \\"a cross between Henry Kissinger and Minnie Mouse\\". In 1984, Westheimer began hosting several television programs on the Lifetime TV network and one in syndication. Her first show was Good Sex! With Dr. Ruth Westheimer, airing for a half hour at 10 pm on weeknights. This show was expanded in 1985 to a full hour and its name was changed to The Dr. Ruth Show. In 1987 she began a separate half hour syndicated series on many broadcast stations called Ask Dr. Ruth which was co- hosted by Larry Angelo. Dr. Ruth returned to the Lifetime network in 1988 with The All New Dr. Ruth Show, which was followed in 1989 by two teen advice shows called What's Up, Dr. Ruth? and a call-in show, You're on the Air with Dr. Ruth in 1990. In 1993 Westheimer and Israeli TV host, Arad Nir, hosted a talk show in Hebrew titled Min Tochnit, on the newly opened Israeli Channel 2. The show was similar to her US Sexually Speaking show. The name of the show, Min Tochnit, is a play on words: literally \\"Kind of a program\\", but \\"Min\\" (◊û◊ô◊ü) in Hebrew also means \\"sex\\" and \\"gender\\". During the 1980s \\"Dr. Ruth\\" became a household name; she made guest appearances on several network television shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman. She also made frequent appearances on the syndicated revival of Hollywood Squares that ran from 1986 to 1989. In the 1990s Westheimer appeared as herself in episode 89 of Quantum Leap, the episode title being \\"Dr. Ruth\\". She appeared on Tom Chapin's album This Pretty Planet, in the song \\"Two Kinds of Seagulls\\", in which she and Chapin sing of various animals that reproduce sexually. \\"It takes two to tingle\\" says the song. Dr. Ruth also appeared in several commercial advertisements, including a 1994 Honda Prelude ad and an ad for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo and body wash. Between 2001 and 2007, Westheimer made regular appearances on the PBS children's television series Between the Lions as \\"Dr. Ruth Wordheimer\\" in a spoof of her therapist role in which she helps anxious readers and spellers overcome their fear of long words. In January 2009, the 55th anniversary issue of Playboy magazine included Westheimer as #13 in a list of the 55 most important people in sex from the past 55 years. In October 2013 the play Becoming Dr. Ruth opened Off Broadway. Actress Debra Jo Rupp played the role of Dr. Ruth. The play showcased the sex therapist's life from fleeing the Nazis in the Kindertransport and joining the Haganah in Jerusalem as a scout and sniper, to her struggles to succeed as a single mother coming to America. Eileen DeSandre played Dr. Ruth in the Virginia Repertory Theatre production of Becoming Dr. Ruth. Westheimer has delivered commencement speeches at the Hebrew Union College seminary, Lehman College of the City University of New York and, in 2004, at Trinity College, where she has been awarded honorary degrees. She also taught courses and seminars at Princeton and Yale, and was the guest speaker at the Bronx High School of Science in New York in commemoration of Yom HaShoah 2008. Westheimer spoke about her life story and the audience of 500 sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" in honor of her 80th birthday. At the ceremony she received an honorary Bronx High School of Science diploma. In 2002, she received the Leo Baeck Medal for her humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice. In the 1980s and 1990s, Westheimer was a frequent guest on late-night talk shows like The Tonight Show and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. She also appeared on talk shows on German television. In 2019, she was a guest on The View, The Today Show and Late Night with Seth Meyers. Westheimer is an accomplished ethnographer. Her studies in this field include the Ethiopian Jews, Papua New Guinea's Trobriand Islanders, and the Druze, a sect originating from Shia Islam now residing in Israel, Syria and Lebanon. The latter were the subject of her 2007 PBS documentary The Olive and the Tree: The Secret Strength of the Druze and a book of the same title. Westheimer is a trustee of the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City. A documentary about her life, Ask Dr. Ruth, premiered in U.S. theaters on May 3, 2019 and was released on Hulu on June 1, 2019. Having previously avoided discussing her early years and how the Holocaust affected her family and herself, Westheimer believes that current events make it necessary for her to \\"stand up and be counted.\\" She stated that seeing child refugees being separated from their parents upsets her, because her own story is reflected in what they are going through. Westheimer continues to be an active figure. In addition to the documentary released about her this year, she has recently published her 45th book. On her 91st birthday (June 4), Westheimer visited the Ellen DeGeneres show, and visited Ellen's show again in November 2019, taking questions from the audience. In 2019 alone, Westheimer has appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers, The View, and Strahan, Sara and Keke.  Personal life  Dr. Ruth Westheimer in 2009. Westheimer has been married three times. She said that each of her marriages played an important role in her relationship advice, but after two divorces, it was her third marriage, to Manfred 'Fred' Westheimer, that was the \\"real marriage\\". She met Fred on a skiing trip in the Catskills. Fred, too, had escaped Nazi Germany. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1997. She has two children, Miriam and Joel, and four grandchildren. In December 2014, Westheimer was a guest at an Orthodox Jewish wedding in the Bronx. The groom, Rabbi Benjamin Goldschmidt, is the great-grandson of the woman who had helped rescue Westheimer from Nazi Germany.

It is located within the Prescott National Forest traversed by State Route 89A approximately midway between Cottonwood and Prescott. The summit can be reached via Forest Service roads that branch off from State Route 89A. From the mountain, there are views of the Verde Valley, Sycamore Canyon Wilderness and the towns of Cottonwood, Jerome, and Clarkdale. The Woodchute Wilderness, north of the summit of 89A, also offers views and hiking trails. There are several National Forest campgrounds in the area and it is the transmitter location for Prescott full-service television station KAZT-TV and several low-power television stations serving Cottonwood, Clarkdale, Camp Verde and Prescott Valley. Mingus Mountain is also the premier flying site of the Arizona Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association. According to the book, Roadside History of Arizona, by Marshall Trimble, \\"Mingus Mountain was named for Joseph and Jacob Mingus, two brothers who settled in the area in the 1880s and later operated a sawmill near the base of the mountain\\". Another source attributes the name to William Mingus (d. 1911, Prescott, Arizona), a pioneer prospector who lived and worked on Mingus Mountain in the 1870s.

The island is named after the archangel Michael, while \\"Skellig\\" is derived from the Irish language word sceilig, meaning a splinter of stone. Its twin island, Little Skellig (Sceilig Bheag), is smaller and inaccessible (landing is not permitted). The two islands rose c. 374‚Äì360 million years ago during a period of mountain formation, along with the MacGillycuddy's Reeks mountain range. Later, they were separated from the mainland by rising water levels. Skellig Michael consists of approximately of rock, with its highest point, known as the Spit, above sea level. The island is defined by its twin peaks and intervening valley (known as Christ's Saddle), which make its landscape steep and inhospitable. It is best known for its Gaelic monastery, founded between the 6th and 8th centuries, and its variety of inhabiting species, which include gannets, puffins, a colony of razorbills and a population of approximately fifty grey seals. The island is of especial interest to archaeologists, as the monastic settlement is in unusually good condition. The rock contains the remains of a tower house, a megalithic stone row and a cross-inscribed slab known as the Wailing Woman. The monastery is situated at an elevation of , Christ's Saddle at , and the flagstaff area at above sea level. The monastery can be approached by narrow and steep flights of stone steps which ascend from three landing points. The hermitage on the south peak contains a dangerous approach and is largely closed to the public. Because of the often difficult crossing from the mainland and the exposed nature of the landing spots, the island is accessible only during summer months. Skellig Michael was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Etymology View of the Wailing Woman rock, with Little Skellig in the distance The word \\"Skellig\\" derives from the old Irish word sceillec, which translates as \\"small or steep area of rock\\". The word is unusual in Irish placenames, and appears only in two other instances; at Bunskellig, County Cork, and the Temple-na-Skellig church in Glendalough, County Wicklow. It may be of Old Norse origin, from the word skellingar (\\"the resounding ones\\"). An early but rarely used alternative Irish name for the island is Glascarraig (\\"the green rock\\"). The first known reference to the Skelligs appears in the Irish annals; a retelling of a shipwreck occurring c. 1400 BC, said to have been caused by the Tuatha D√© Danann, a supernatural race in Irish mythology. According to legend, Irr, son of M√≠l Esp√°ine (who is sometimes credited with the colonisation of Ireland), was travelling from the Iberian Peninsula, but drowned and was buried on the island. Daire Domhain (\\"King of the World\\") is said to have stayed there c. 200 AD before attacking Fionn mac Cumhaill's army in nearby Ventry. A text from the 8th or 9th-century records that Duagh, King of West Munster, fled to \\"Scellecc\\" after a feud with the Kings of Cashel sometime in the 5th century, although the historicity of the event has not been established. Other early mentions include in the narrative prose of the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn and Cath Finntr√°gha, as well the medieval Martyrology of Tallaght. Geography and features Map of the island Skellig Michael is a steep pyramidal rugged rock (or \\"crag\\") of on the Atlantic coast off the Iveragh peninsula of County Kerry. It is west north west of Bolus Head, at the southern end of Saint Finian's Bay. Its twin island, Little Skellig, is a mile closer to land, and far more inhospitable, because of its sheer cliff faces. The small Lemon Rock island is further inland. The nearby Puffin Island is another seabird colony. The Skelligs, along with some of the Blasket Islands, constitute the most westerly part of both the Republic of Ireland and Europe excluding Iceland. The island is defined by its two peaks: the north-east summit where the monastery is built (185 meters above sea level), and the south-west point containing the hermitage (218 meters above sea level). These elevations reside on either side of a depression colloquially known as Christ's Saddle. =Geology= The islands are composed of Old Red Sandstone and compressed slate, formed between 360 and 374 million years ago, as part of the rising of the MacGillycuddy's Reeks and Caha Mountains mountains ranges. This occurred during the Devonian period when Ireland was part of a larger continental landmass and located south of the equator. The region's topography of peaks and valleys are characterised by steep ridges formed during the Hercynian period of folding and mountain formation some 300 million years ago. When the Atlantic ocean level rose, it created deep marine inlets such as Bantry Bay and left the Skelligs detached from the mainland. The rock is highly compressed and contains numerous fracture lines and jointing. As a result of erosion along a major north‚Äìsouth-trending fault line containing bedrock much more brittle than that on surrounding areas, a large part of the rock broke away, resulting in Christ's Saddle, the depression between the peaks. The island's rock is deeply eroded through exposure to wind and water. Pathway to the monastery The Wailing Woman rock lies in the centre of the island, on the ascent before the Christ's Saddle ridge, above sea level, on of grassland. It is the only flat and fertile part of the island, and thus contains traces of medieval crop farming. The path from the Saddle to the summit is known as the Way of the Christ, a nomenclature that reflects the danger presented to climbers. Notable features on this stretch include the Needle's Eye peak, a stone chimney above sea level, and a series of 14 stone crosses with names such as the \\"Rock of the Women's piercing caoine\\", further references to the harsh climb. Further up is the Stone of Pain area, including the station known as the Spit, a long and narrow fragment of rock approached by steps. The ruin of the medieval church is lower and approached before the older monastery. =Bays= The island's three main bays are Blind Man's Cove to the east, Cross Cove to the south and Blue Cove to the north. Each can be used as access points from the sea. All three have steps carved into the rock from their landing point to above sea level. The main landing cove is on the recesses of the eastern side; known as Blind Man's Cove, it is exposed to sea swells and high waves, making approach difficult outside the summer months. The bay's pier is positioned under a sheer cliff face, populated by high numbers of birds. It was built in 1826 from an area known as the Flagstaff and leads to a small stairway leading to the now disused lighthouse. The steps split into two staircases, the earliest and largely abandoned path leading directly to the monastery. Blue Cove is the most difficult landing point and is only approachable on an average of 20 days per year. Noting the inaccessibility of the island, writer Des Lavelle observes that \\"the fact that the monks of old undertook the giant task of constructing a stairway to this bleak cove is a good argument that the weather conditions then were far better than now.\\" Demographics Ecology Gull with Little Skellig in background Skellig Michael is lined by exposed sea cliffs and three bays. Its inland is mostly of thin soil on steep ground, with patches of vegetation which are, however, exposed to sea spray. Nonetheless, it has an ecology far more diverse than on the mainland; as an island, it provides sanctuary to wide varieties of flora and fauna, many of which are unusual to Ireland. It contains a large range of seabirds, now protected by the island's status as a nature reserve owned by the state. The Skellig Islands were classified as a Special Protection Area in 1986 when they were recognised for containing an unusually large variety and population of birds. Puffins on Skellig Michael The island hosts eyries for peregrine falcons. Other birds of interest include fulmars, Manx shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus), storm petrels, gannets, kittiwakes, guillemots and Atlantic puffins. A herd of goats lived on the island until recently, and it supports a population of rabbits and house mice, both relatively recent introductions, probably introduced in the 19th century by lighthouse attendants. Grey seals haul out on the island's ledges. History =Monastic= Skellig Michael was largely uninhabited until the founding of the Augustinian monastery. Many of the islands of the west coast of Ireland contain early Christian monasteries, which were favoured because of their isolation and the abundance of rock for construction. A strong concentration of monasteries can be found off the coast of County Kerry, with nine in total found on islands off the Iveragh and Dingle peninsula. The Annals of Inisfallen record a Viking attack in 823. The site had been dedicated to Saint Michael by at least 1044 (when the death of \\"Aedh of Scelic-Mhich√≠\\" is recorded). However, this dedication may have occurred as early as 950, around which time a new church was added to the monastery (typically done to celebrate a consecration) and called Saint Michael's Church. The island was a regular destination for pilgrims by the early 16th century. Stairs and paths View of the south steps Path to Christ's Saddle Each of the three landing areas lead to long flights of steps (known as the east, south and north steps) built by the first generations of monks to inhabit the island. They may have at one time formed part of a larger network; traces of other, possibly earlier steps have been uncovered elsewhere on the island. Archaeological evidence shows that basal sections of each series of steps were rock-cut, giving way to more stable dry stone masonry once they reached an altitude where the sea waves would no longer weather them. Later the base steps were replaced with dry-stone paths. The north steps lead from Blue Cove and consist of two long and steep continuous flights known as the upper and lower steps. The upper pathway was built from dry stone but in places are in very poor condition; given the steep face on which they are built, they are prone to erosion and the impact of falling stone from the cliffs directly above. The lower rock-cut portion has been heavily weathered by the sea, and some of the ground around them has collapsed; the portions where steps are lost have been replaced with ramps. A parapet at their lowest base was added in the 1820s, and they were widened during the construction of the lighthouse. The south steps are most commonly used today and merge with the north steps at Christ's Saddle, to lead to the monastery. They cross several archaeological features, including a prayer station and walling. They are in good condition and were probably repaired by the lighthouse builders. Their weakest point, directly above Christ's Saddle, suffers wear and tear from continual use by modern visitors and require continual maintenance. The landing steps may have been built by the lighthouse builders; 14 steps apart from the main landing are virtually inaccessible, stopping short at both ends and leading neither to the sea nor to the highest levels. The base of the east steps above Blind Man's Cove was heavily blasted with dynamite in 1820 during the construction of the pier and Lighthouse Road and are now inaccessible from the landing point. The steps above this level, on a very steep climb along a sheer face, have been subject to conservation, most recently in 2002/2003 when large amounts of overgrowth were removed, and they are today in good condition. Monastery The monastery is built into a terraced shelf above sea level. It contains two oratories, a cemetery, crosses, cross-slabs, six cloch√°n-type domed beehive cells (of which one has fallen) and a medieval church. The cells and oratories are all of dry-built corbel construction, and the church, which was constructed at a later date, is of mortared stone. Full view of the monastery complex with garden terrace at front The year of the monastery's foundation is unknown. Like many early Christian remnants in Kerry, it is sometimes attributed to Saint Finnia, though this is doubted by historians. The first definite reference to monastic activity on the island is a record of the death of \\"Suibhini of Skelig\\" dating from the 8th century; however, Fion√°n is claimed to have founded the monastery in the 6th century. The Annals of the Four Masters detail events at the Skelligs between the 9th and 11th centuries. These entries suggest that Eitgall of Skellig, the monastery's abbot, was taken by the Vikings in 823 and died of starvation thereafter. The Vikings again attacked in 838, sacking churches in Kenmare town, Skellig and Innisfallen Island. The Augustinian abbey in Ballinskelligs was founded in 950, the same year that Blathmhac of Sceilig died. Finally, the annals mention the death of Aedh of Sceilig Michael in 1040. The Monks Graveyard The largest hut, known as cell A, has a floor area of 14.5 √ó 3.8m, and is 5 meters high. Like the other huts, its internal walls are straight before narrowing to accommodate its dome roof. Protruding stones in the interior, acting as pegs, are placed at about 2.5 meters to support the roof, and in some instances may have supported upstairs living quarters. Protruding stones on the exterior most likely acted as anchors for thatch roofing. Some cells contain recesses that may have been formed to contain cupboards. The main oratory is boat-shaped, and measures 3.6 √ó 4.3 meters. It has an altar a small window on its eastern wall. The small oratory is situated on its own terrace, at a relative distance from the main complex. It measures 2.4 √ó 1.8 √ó 2.4 metres and contains a low door (0.9 √ó 0.5 meters) and a comparatively large, 1-metre high window on its northeastern wall. St. Michael's Church dates to the 10th or early 11th century. It was originally constructed from mostly lime mortar with imported sandstone from Valentia Island. It is today mostly collapsed, with only its eastern window still standing. The centre of the church contains a modern gravestone, dated 1871, erected for members of the family of one of the lighthouse keepers. The Monk's Graveyard is partially collapsed and smaller than when it was in active use. It contains stone crosses with mostly plain inscripted decorative patterns on its west side, two of which are highly detailed and believed to be early features of the site; in total over a hundred individual stone crosses have been found on the island. There are several large orthostats on its north and west sides. There are two dry stone leachta on the site. The larger is positioned between Saint Michael's Church and the main Oratory, and is thought to pre-date both, and once had a large upright cross at its western end, which is now broken off. The other is located against the monastery retaining wall at the south of the oratory. Human remains have been found underneath both. File:High cross on grave at Skellig Michael.jpgHigh cross File:Skellig Michael - cemetery and large oratory.jpgGraveyard and large oratory File:Skellig hives.jpgCloch√°ns; dry-stone huts with a corbel roofs It has been estimated that no more than twelve monks and an abbot lived at the monastery at any one time. The monastery was continuously occupied until the late 12th or early 13th century and remained a site for pilgrimage through to the modern era. The diet of the island monks was somewhat different from that of those on the mainland. With less arable land available to grow grain, vegetable gardens were an important part of monastic life. Of necessity, fish and the meat and eggs of birds nesting on the islands were staples. Theories for the site's abandonment include that the climate around Skellig Michael became colder and more prone to storms, Viking raids, and changes to the structure of the Irish Church. Probably a combination of these factors prompted the community to abandon the island and move to the abbey in Ballinskelligs. The move was recorded by the Cambro-Norman cleric and historian Giraldus Cambrensis at the end of the 12th century when he wrote that the monks had moved to a new site on the continent. Hermitage The hermitage is on the opposite side of the island to the monastery, below the south peak, and is significantly more difficult and hazardous to approach. Today, access to the south peak is restricted and only permitted after prior arrangement. It is approached from Christ's Saddle via a very narrow and steep series of rock-cut steps exposed on all sides to high winds, at times to near-hurricane force. The pathway passes through the Needle's Eye, a rock chimney formed by a narrow vertical crack in the peak. Though its origin and history are not as well studied as that of the monastery, the hermitage is thought to originate from the 9th century and comprises several enclosures and platforms situated on three main terraces cut into the rock. The terraces are known as the Oratory, Garden and Outer Terraces. The oratory terrace, two hundred meters above sea level and fifteen meters below the summit, is the largest and is in good condition. The main oratory is still largely intact and contains its original altar, bench, a water cistern and what is likely the remnants of a shrine. The masonry work is typical of the Early Christian period in Ireland. It seems likely that the hermitage was built later than the monastery; given the presumed difficulty of its construction, which would have involved the movement of large pieces of stone up almost sheer cliff faces, the builders would have needed the monastery as a base. The eroding effect of frost on the island's major fault line provided the masons with large amounts of materials for the construction. The interior of the main building measures 2.3 meters long and 1.2 metres wide. The enclosure wall is made from mostly small stones. Although it is now worn and mostly knocked down, it would once have been 1‚Äì1.5 metres high. The interior is today full of stone rubble fallen from the structure and the fragments of a 7-foot tall stone cross. The leacht outside of it was probably used as a shrine or altar; it is too small to have been a burial site. The outer terrace is situated on three stepped ledges some distance from the main complex and is difficult to access. Its only masonry consists of a 17-meter- long wall along its steep and exposed perimeter. Wondering why such an inaccessible and harsh outpost might have been built, the historian Walter Horn wrote that \\"the goal of an ascetic was not comfort\\" and recalled that the Cambrai Homily states: \\"This is our denial of ourselves, if we do not indulge our desires and if we abjure our sins. This is our taking-up of our cross upon us if we receive loss and martyrdom and suffering for Christ's sake.\\" =Post- monastic= Skellig Michael remained in the possession of the Catholic Canons Regular until the dissolution of Ballinskelligs Abbey in 1578, a result of the reformation by Elizabeth I. Ownership of the islands passed to the Butler family (for rental of \\"two hawks and a quantity of puffin feathers yearly\\"), with whom it stayed until the early 1820s when the Corporation for Preserving and Improving the Port of Dublin (predecessor to the Commissioners of Irish Lights) purchased the island for ¬£500 from John Butler of Waterville in a compulsory purchase order. The corporation constructed two lighthouses on the Atlantic side of the island, and associated living quarters, all of which was completed by 1826. Edwin Wyndham-Quin, 3rd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, July 1861. Lord Dunraven's Notes on Irish Architecture contain the first complete archaeological survey of the island. In 1871, Lord Dunraven, in his Notes on Irish Architecture, made the first comprehensive archaeological survey of the island. Describing the monastery, he wrote \\"the scene is one so solemn and so sad that none should enter here but the pilgrim and the penitent. The sense of solitude, the vast heaven above and the sublime monotonous motion of the sea beneath would oppress the spirit, were not that spirit brought into harmony.\\" He was less charitable of the lighthouse project and described their alterations as attributed to \\"the lighthouse workmen who...in 1838, built some objectionable modern walls\\". The Office of Public Works took the remains of the monastery into guardianship in 1880, before purchasing the island (with the exception of the lighthouses and associated structures) from the Commissioners of Irish Lights. Skellig Michael was made a World Heritage Site in 1996. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (an advisory body of the World Heritage Committee) described Skellig Michael as of \\"exceptional universal value\\", and a \\"unique example of an early religious settlement\\", while also noting the site's preservation as a result of its \\"remarkable environment\\", and its ability to illustrate \\"as no other site can, the extremes of a Christian monasticism characterising much of North Africa, the Near East and Europe\\". In culture Several films and documentaries have used the island as a filming location. The island was used as a filming location in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017). Aerial footage of the island was also used in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). It also served as a location for the final scene in Heart of Glass (1976), and in Byzantium (2012). In the first episode of the 1969 BBC documentary Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark, art historian Kenneth Clark described the island's buildings and pathways as \\"an extraordinary achievement of courage and tenacity\\". He observed that \\"looking back from the great civilizations of twelfth-century France or seventeenth- century Rome, it is hard to believe, that for quite a long time ‚Äì almost a hundred years ‚Äì western Christianity survived by clinging to places like Skellig Michael, a pinnacle of rock eighteen miles from the Irish coast, rising out of the sea.\\" Access and tourism View of approach Skellig Michael contains three landing points variously used by monks depending on the weather conditions. Today the island receives an average of 11,000 visitors per year. To protect the site, the Office of Public Works limits the number of visitors to 180 per day. The local climate and exposed terrain make the crossing from the mainland to Skellig Michael difficult. Once landed, the island's terrain is steep, unprotected and dangerous. The rock is ascended via 600 medieval stone steps leading towards the main island peak. This remoteness and inaccessibility has long discouraged visitors, so the island is exceptionally well preserved. Tourism began in the late 19th century when a rowing boat could be hired for 25 shillings. It did not become a popular tourist destination until the early 1970s when small chartered passenger boats became more frequent; five were available in 1973 at a price of ¬£3 per person. By 1990, the level of demand had grown to the extent that the Office of Public Works began to organise ten boats departing from four individual harbours. View of Skellig Beag from inside the monastery's large oratory Each year at least four boat licences are granted to tour operators who run trips to Skellig Michael during the summer season (May to October, inclusive), weather permitting. Even when conditions on the mainland are calm, the sea around the island can be turbulent. The area is a landing point for sea swells travelling in from distant depressions in the Atlantic. The island is lashed by water from all sides, with wave crests breaking at up to 10 metres over the pier and 45 metres along the lighthouse. When such large wave troughs recede, they can often expose ragged seaweed stumps, sponges and anemones on the rock faces, further hampering approach and landing. A typical visit lasts about six hours. The Office of Public Works emphasises that the journey presents safety challenges. For safety reasons, mainly because the steps are steep, rocky, old and unprotected, climbs are not permitted during wet or windy weather. Dive sites immediately around the rock, mostly around Blue Cove, are permitted in summer.

Mutt and Jeff was a long-running and widely popular American newspaper comic strip created by cartoonist Bud Fisher in 1907 about \\"two mismatched tinhorns\\". It is commonly regarded as the first daily comic strip. The concept of a newspaper strip featuring recurring characters in multiple panels on a six-day-a-week schedule had previously been pioneered through the short-lived A. Piker Clerk by Clare Briggs, but it was Mutt and Jeff as the first successful daily comic strip that staked out the direction of the future trend. Mutt and Jeff remained in syndication until 1983, employing the talents of several cartoonists, chiefly Al Smith who drew the strip for nearly fifty years. The series eventually became a comic book, initially published by All-American Publications and later published by DC Comics, Dell Comics and Harvey Comics. Later it was also published as cartoons, films, pop culture merchandise and reprints. Syndicated success Harry Conway \\"Bud\\" Fisher was a sports cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle in the early 1900s, a time when a newspaper cartoon was single panel. His innovation was to tell a cartoon gag in a sequence, or strip, of panels, creating the first American comic strip to successfully pioneer that since-common format. The concept of a newspaper strip featuring recurring characters in multiple panels on a six-day-a-week schedule actually had been created by Clare Briggs with A. Piker Clerk four years earlier, but that short-lived effort did not inspire further comics in a comic-strip format. As comics historian Don Markstein explained, A. Mutt, the comic strip that became better known by its later title, Mutt and Jeff, debuted on November 15, 1907 on the sports pages of the San Francisco Chronicle. The featured character had previously appeared in sports cartoons by Fisher but was unnamed. Fisher had approached his editor, John P. Young, about doing a regular strip as early as 1905, but was turned down. According to Fisher, Young told him, \\"It would take up too much room, and readers are used to reading down the page, and not horizontally.\\"The Comics Journal #289, April 2008, p. 175. This strip focused on a single main character until the other half of the duo appeared on March 27, 1908. It appeared only in the Chronicle, so Fisher did not have the extended lead time that syndicated strips require. Episodes were drawn the day before publication, and frequently referred to local events that were currently making headlines or to specific horse races being run that day. A 1908 sequence about Mutt's trial featured a parade of thinly-disguised caricatures of specific San Francisco political figures, many of whom were being prosecuted for graft. On June 7, 1908, the strip moved off the sports pages and into Hearst's San Francisco Examiner where it was syndicated by King Features and became a national hit, subsequently making Fisher the first celebrity of the comics industry.\\"Bud Fisher at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 4, 2012. Fisher had taken the precaution of copyrighting the strip in his own name, facilitating the move to King Features and making it impossible for the Chronicle to continue the strip using another artist. A dispute between Fisher and King Features arose in 1913, and Fisher moved his strip on September 15, 1915, to the Wheeler Syndicate (later the Bell Syndicate), who gave Fisher 60% of the gross revenue, an enormous income in those times. Hearst responded by launching a lawsuit which ultimately failed. By 1916, Fisher was earning in excess of $150,000 a year. By the 1920s, merchandising and growing circulation had increased his income to an estimated $250,000.https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21568586-internet- has-unleashed-burst-cartooning-creativity-triumph-nerds In 1918, Mutt and Jeff added a Sunday strip and, as success continued, Fisher became increasingly dependent on assistants to produce the work. Fisher hired Billy Liverpool and Ed Mack, artists Hearst had at one point groomed to take over the strip, who would do most of the artwork. Other assistants on the strip included Ken Kling, George Herriman, and Maurice Sendak (while still in high school). Fisher appeared to lose all interest in the strip during the 1930s, and after Mack died in 1932, the job of creating the strip fell to Al Smith. In c. 1944, the new Chicago-based Field Syndicate took over the strip. Mutt and Jeff retained Fisher's signature until his death, however, so it wasn't until December 7, 1954, that the strip started being signed by Smith. Al Smith received the National Cartoonists Society Humor Comic Strip Award in 1968 for his work on the strip. Smith continued to draw Mutt and Jeff until 1980, two years before it ceased publication. In the introduction to Forever Nuts: The Early Years of Mutt & Jeff, Allan Holtz gave the following reason for the strip's longevity and demise: During this final period it was drawn by George Breisacher. Currently, Andrews McMeel Universal continues to syndicate Mutt and Jeff under the imprint Classic Mutt and Jeff (in both English and Spanish language versions) under the copyright of Pierre S. de Beaumont (1915‚Äì2010), founder of the Brookstone catalog and retail chain. De Beaumont inherited ownership of the strip from his mother, Aedita de Beaumont,Fox, Margalit. \\"Pierre de Beaumont, Brookstone Founder, Dies at 95\\". The New York Times, March 18, 2011. who married Fisher in 1925 (the couple parted after four weeks, but never divorced).\\"Private Lives\\", Life magazine, December 28, 1936, page 62 A Mutt and Jeff strip from 1913 Characters and story Augustus Mutt is a tall, dimwitted racetrack character‚Äîa fanatic horse-race gambler who is motivated by greed. Mutt has a wife, known only as Mrs. Mutt (Mutt always referred to her as \\"M'love\\") and a son named Cicero. Mutt first encountered the half-pint Jeff, an inmate of an insane asylum who shares his passion for horseracing, in 1908. They appeared in more and more strips together until the strip abandoned the horse-race theme, and concentrated on Mutt's other outlandish, get-rich-quick schemes. Jeff usually served as a (sometimes unwilling) partner. Jeff was short, bald as a billiard ball, and wore mutton chop sideburns. He has no last name, stating his name is \\"just Jeff‚Äîfirst and last and always it's Jeff\\". However, at one point late in the strip's life, he is identified in the address of a cablegram as \\"Othello Jeff\\". He has a twin brother named Julius. They look so much alike that Jeff, who cannot afford to have a portrait painted, sits for Julius, who is too busy to pose. Rarely does Jeff change from his habitual outfit of top hat and suit with wing collar. Friends of Mutt and Jeff have included Gus Geevem, Joe Spivis, and the English Sir Sidney. Characteristic lines and catchphrases that appeared often during the run of the strip included \\"Nix, Mutt, nix!\\", \\"For the love of Mike!\\" and \\"Oowah!\\" The original inspiration for the character of \\"Jeff\\" was Jacques \\"Jakie\\" Fehr, a tiny (4'8\\") irascible Swiss-born shopkeeper in the village of Occidental, California. One summer day in 1908, Fisher, a member of San Francisco's Bohemian Club, was riding the North Pacific Coast narrow-gauge railway passenger train northbound to the Bohemian Grove, the club's summer campsite. During a stop in Occidental, Fisher got off the train to stretch his legs and observed the diminutive walrus-moustached Fehr in heated altercation with the tall and lanky \\"candy butcher\\", who sold refreshments on the train and also distributed newspapers to shops in towns along the train route. The comic potential in this scene prompted Fisher to add the character of Jeff to his A. Mutt comic strip, with great success. Cicero's Cat Bud Fisher's Cicero's Cat (August 7, 1942) Starting October 27, 1926, the Sunday page included a topper strip about Cicero, Mutt's son. On December 3, 1933, the topper began to focus on Cicero's pet, Desdemona. Under the title Cicero's Cat, this pantomime strip ran until 1972. Comic books and reprints * The Cupples & Leon Company produced at least 18 reprint collections of Mutt and Jeff daily strips, in 10\\" x 10\\" softcover books from 1919 to 1933. They also published two larger hardcover editions, Mutt and Jeff BIG Book (1926) and Mutt and Jeff BIG Book No. 2 (1929). * Mutt and Jeff also appeared in comic books. They were featured on the front cover of Famous Funnies #1, the first modern format comic book, and reprints appeared in DC Comics' All American Comics. It has been suggested that some of the Mutt and Jeff material published by DC Comics were new stories drawn by Sheldon Mayer * In 1939, DC gave them their own comic book, published until 1958 for 103 issues, that consisted entirely of newspaper reprints. Dell Comics took over the feature after DC dropped it, but their tenure only lasted for one year and 12 issues. Many of the Dell issues featured new, conventional-length stories drawn by Smith. * Harvey Comics, which had several other comic strip reprint comics running at the time, picked up Mutt and Jeff from Dell, and this version of the comic ran to 1965 for a total of 33 issues, plus two short-lived spinoff titles: Mutt & Jeff Jokes and Mutt & Jeff New Jokes.

Motion pictures =Live-action= In early July 1911, during the silent era of motion pictures, at David Horsley's Nestor Comedies in Bayonne, New Jersey, Al Christie began turning out a weekly one-reel live-action Mutt and Jeff comedy short, which was based on the comic strip. The Mutt and Jeff serial was extremely popular and after the Nestor Company established a studio in Hollywood, in late October 1911, Christie continued to oversee a weekly production of a one-reel episode. In the fall of 1911, Nestor began using an alternate method of displaying the intertitles in the Mutt and Jeff comedies. Instead of a cut to the dialogue titles, the dialogue was displayed at the bottom of the image on a black background so the audience could read them as a subtitle, which was similar to the way they appeared in the cartoon strips. Horsley was very proud of the device and claimed to have entered a patent on it. He advertised the Mutt and Jeff movies as \\"talking pictures\\".Eileen Bowser.

Drane, a tall man noted for his resemblance to President Lincoln, who actually played Lincoln in his last movie, The Crisis (1916), as A. Mutt, and Gus Alexander, whose nickname was \\"Shorty\\", as Jeff. When Alexander was leaving the serial, Christie hired the small actor Bud Duncan.

Radio & Television Film Packagers were the producers of the film, which received a very limited theatrical release, primarily being shown on the 16MM circuit.

Background Wynn was born Isaiah Edwin Leopold in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, Joseph, who manufactured and sold women's hats, was born in Bohemia. His mother, Minnie Greenberg, of Romanian and Turkish ancestry, came from Istanbul. Wynn attended Central High School in Philadelphia until age 15.Biography of Ed Wynn at Turner Classic Movies. He ran away from home in his teens, worked as a hat salesman, and as a utility boy, and eventually adapted his middle name \\"Edwin\\" into his new stage name, \\"Ed Wynn\\", to save his family the embarrassment of having a lowly comedian as a relative. Early career Wynn began his career in vaudeville in 1903\\"New York Hoorays for Ed Wynn\\" , Life, December 20, 1937, p. 46, accessed May 31, 2011.\\"August Clown\\" , Life, July 26, 1948, p. 74, accessed May 31, 2011. and was a star of the Ziegfeld Follies starting in 1914. During The Follies of 1915, W. C. Fields allegedly caught Wynn mugging for the audience under the table during Fields' Pool Room routine and knocked Wynn unconscious with his cue.\\"August Clown\\" , Life, July 26, 1948, p. 70, accessed May 31, 2011. Wynn wrote, directed, and produced many Broadway shows in the subsequent decades, and was known for his silly costumes and props as well as for the giggly, wavering voice he developed for the 1921 musical revue, The Perfect Fool. Radio Ed Wynn as \\"Mr. Busybody\\" 1908 In the early 1930s Wynn hosted the popular radio show The Fire Chief,http://www.radioechoes.com/?page=series&genre;=OTR- Comedy&series;=Ed%20Wynn%20The%20Fire%20Chief heard in North America on Tuesday nights, sponsored by Texaco gasoline. Like many former vaudeville performers who turned to radio in the same decade, the stage-trained Wynn insisted on playing for a live studio audience, doing each program as an actual stage show, using visual bits to augment his written material, and in his case, wearing a colorful costume with a red fireman's helmet. He usually bounced his gags off announcer/straight man Graham McNamee; Wynn's customary opening, \\"Tonight, Graham, the show's gonna be different,\\" became one of the most familiar tag-lines of its time; a sample joke: \\"Graham, my uncle just bought a new second-handed car... he calls it Baby! I don't know, it won't go anyplace without a rattle!\\" Wynn reprised his Fire Chief radio character in two movies, Follow the Leader (1930) and The Chief (1933). Near the height of his radio fame (1933) he founded his own short-lived radio network the Amalgamated Broadcasting System, which lasted only five weeks, nearly destroying the comedian. According to radio historian Elizabeth McLeod, the failed venture left Wynn deep in debt, divorced and finally, suffering a nervous breakdown. Wynn was offered the title role The Wizard in MGM's 1939 screen adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, but turned it down, as did his Ziegfeld contemporary W. C. Fields. The part went to Frank Morgan. Television Ed Wynn first appeared on television on July 7, 1936 in a brief, ad-libbed spot with Graham McNamee during an NBC experimental television broadcast. In the 1949‚Äì50 season, Wynn hosted one of the first network, comedy-variety television shows, on CBS, and won both a Peabody Award and an Emmy Award in 1949. Buster Keaton, Lucille Ball, and The Three Stooges all made guest appearances with Wynn. This was the first CBS variety television show to originate from Los Angeles, which was seen live on the west coast, but filmed via kinescope for distribution in the Midwest and East, as the national coaxial cable had yet to be completed. Wynn was also a rotating host of NBC's Four Star Revue from 1950 through 1952. After the end of Wynn's third television series, The Ed Wynn Show (a short-lived situation comedy on NBC's 1958‚Äì59 schedule), his son, actor Keenan Wynn, encouraged him to make a career change rather than retire. The comedian reluctantly began a career as a dramatic actor in television and movies. Father and son appeared in three productions, the first of which was the 1956 Playhouse 90 broadcast of Rod Serling's play Requiem for a Heavyweight. Ed was terrified of straight acting and kept goofing his lines in rehearsal. When the producers wanted to fire him, star Jack Palance said he would quit if they fired Ed. (However, unbeknownst to Wynn, supporting player Ned Glass was his secret understudy in case something did happen before air time.) On live broadcast night, Wynn surprised everyone with his pitch-perfect performance, and his quick ad libs to cover his mistakes. A dramatization of what happened during the production was later staged as an April 1960 Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse episode, \\"The Man in the Funny Suit\\", starring both senior and junior Wynns, with key figures involved in the original production also portraying themselves. Ed and his son also worked together in the Jose Ferrer film The Great Man, with Ed again proving his unexpected skills in drama. Wynn (left) and Richard Crenna (right) in Slattery's People, 1964. Requiem established Wynn as a serious dramatic actor who could easily hold his own with the best. His performance in The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 1959, Wynn appeared on Serling's TV series The Twilight Zone in \\"One for the Angels\\". Serling, a longtime admirer, had written that episode especially for him, and Wynn later in 1963 starred in the episode \\"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\\". For the rest of his life, Wynn skillfully moved between comic and dramatic roles. He appeared in feature films and anthology television, endearing himself to new generations of fans. Cartoons Wynn was caricatured in the Merrie Melodies cartoon shorts Shuffle Off to Buffalo (1933) and I've Got to Sing a Torch Song (1933), and as a pot of jam in the Betty Boop short Betty in Blunderland (1934). Films He appeared as the Fairy Godfather in Jerry Lewis' Cinderfella. His performance as Paul Beaseley in the 1958 film The Great Man earned him nominations for a Golden Globe Award for \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" and a BAFTA Award for \\"Best Foreign Actor\\". The following year he received his first (and only) nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Mr. Dussell in The Diary of Anne Frank (1959). Six years later he appeared in the Bible epic The Greatest Story Ever Told. Disney Wynn provided the voice of the Mad Hatter in Walt Disney's film, Alice in Wonderland and played The Toymaker alongside Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands in the Christmas operetta film Babes in Toyland released in 1961. Possibly his best-remembered film appearance was in Walt Disney's Mary Poppins (1964), in which he played eccentric Uncle Albert floating around just beneath the ceiling in uncontrollable mirth, singing \\"I Love to Laugh\\". Re-teaming with the Disney team the following year, in That Darn Cat! (1965) featuring Dean Jones and Hayley Mills, Wynn filled out the character of Mr. Hofstedder, the watch jeweler with his bumbling charm. He also had brief roles in The Absent Minded Professor (as the fire chief, in a scene alongside his son Keenan Wynn, who played the film's antagonist) and Son of Flubber (as county agricultural agent A.J. Allen). His final performance, as Rufus in Walt Disney's The Gnome- Mobile, was released a few months after his death. In addition to Disney films, Wynn was also an actor in the Disneyland production The Golden Horseshoe Revue. Death The niche of Ed Wynn, in the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale. Wynn died June 19, 1966, in Beverly Hills, California, of esophageal cancer, aged 79. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, in the Fuchsia Terrace section of the Great Mausoleum, Daffodil Corridor, Columbarium of the Dawn, alongside his son Keenan Wynn, his granddaughter Emily Wynn (February 13, 1960 ‚Äì November 27, 1980), who died from lupus, and his sister-in-law, Blanche Einstein Leopold (May 18, 1880 ‚Äì December 26, 1973).

The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards. DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Ka≈°telanski and Tribidrag, as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia (the \\"heel\\" of Italy), where it was introduced in the 18th century.Jancis Robinson, \\"The Great Grapevine\\" in The Financial Times, October 12th, 2012 The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century, where it became known by variations of a name applied to a different grape, likely \\"Zierfandler\\" from Austria. The grapes typically produce a robust red wine, although in the United States a semi-sweet ros√© (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times the sales of the red wine. The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent. The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier- ripening Primitivo clone.  History  = Europe (6000 BCE‚Äì1870) = Archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of Vitis vinifera occurred in the Caucasus region around 6000 BCE, and winemaking was discovered shortly after that. Cultivation of the vine subsequently spread to the Mediterranean and surrounding regions. Croatia once had several indigenous varieties related to Zinfandel, which formed the basis of its wine industry in the 19th century. This diversity suggests that the grapes have been grown in Croatia longer than anywhere else. These varieties were almost entirely wiped out, however, by the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century, eventually reducing Zinfandel to just nine vines of locally-known \\"Crljenak Ka≈°telanski\\" discovered in 2001 on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia. The first documented use of the term Primitivo appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name derives from the terms primativus or primaticcio, which refer to the grape's tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties. This name's appearance, 40 years after the first documented use of the term Zinfandel, was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic; however, this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine's Croatian origin. Primitivo is now thought to have been introduced as a distinct clone into the Apulia region of Italy in the 18th century. Don Francesco Filippo Indellicati, the priest of the church at Gioia del Colle near Bari, selected an early (\\"primo\\") ripening plant of the Zagarese variety and planted it in Liponti. This clone ripened at the end of August and became widespread throughout northern Apulia. Cuttings came to the other great Primitivo DOC (denominazione di origine controllata or \\"denomination of controlled origin\\") as part of the dowry of the Countess Sabini of Altamura when she married Don Tommaso Schiavoni-Tafuri of Manduria in the late 19th century. = United States east coast (1829‚Äì1850) = The arrival of Zinfandel in the United States may have been via the Imperial Nursery in Vienna, Austria, which probably obtained the vines during the Habsburg Monarchy's control over the Dalmatian territories of the former Republic of Venice.Sullivan, Chapter 2 George Gibbs, a horticulturist on Long Island, received shipments of grapes from Sch√∂nbrunn and elsewhere in Europe between 1820 and 1829. Sullivan suggests that the \\"Black Zinfardel of Hungary\\" mentioned by William Robert Prince in A Treatise on the Vine (1830) may have referred to one of Gibbs's 1829 acquisitions. Webster suggests that the name is a modification of the Hungarian tzinif√°ndli (czirifandli), which derives from the German Zierfandler, a white grape (Gr√ºner Sylvaner) from Austria's Thermenregion. Gibbs visited Boston in 1830, and Samuel Perkins of that city began selling \\"Zenfendal\\" soon afterward. In 1830, Gibbs also supplied Prince with \\"Black St. Peters\\", a similar variety that may have come from England, where many vines have \\"St. Peters\\" in their names. Little is known about this vine, except that the Black St. Peters that arrived in California in the 1850s was the same as what became known as Zinfandel by the 1870s. By 1835 Charles M. Hovey, Boston‚Äôs leading nurseryman, was recommending \\"Zinfindal\\" as a table grape, and it was soon widely grown in heated greenhouses for the production of table grapes as early as June. The first reference to making wine from \\"Zinfindal\\" appears in John Fisk Allen's Practical Treatise in the Culture and Treatment of the Grape Vine (1847). Meanwhile, the fad of hothouse cultivation faded in the 1850s as attention turned to the Concord and other grape varieties that could be grown outdoors in Boston. = California (1850‚Äì1933) = Prince and other nurserymen such as Frederick W. Macondray (future son in law of Faxon Atherton), joined the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, and took Zinfandel with them. Prince's notebook records that the grape dried \\"perfectly to Raisin\\" and that he believed his Zinfandel was the same as the \\"Black Sonora\\" he found in California. When the vine known as \\"Black St. Peters\\" arrived in California, it was initially regarded as a distinct variety, but by the 1870s it was recognized as the same grape as Zinfandel. Joseph W. Osborne may have made the first wine from Zinfandel in California. He planted Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll vineyard just north of Napa, and his wine was much praised in 1857. Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after, and by the end of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California. These Zinfandel old vines are now treasured for the production of premium red wine, but many were ripped up in the 1920s, during the Prohibition years (1920‚Äì1933), but not for the obvious reason. Even during the Prohibition, home winemaking remained effectively legal, p2 Chapter 1 and some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home. While Zinfandel grapes proved popular among home winemakers living near the vineyards, it was vulnerable to rot on the long journey to East Coast markets.Pinney p26 The thick-skinned Alicante Bouschet was less susceptible to rot, so this and similar varieties were widely planted for the home winemaking market. In 1931, 3000 cars ‚Äì about ‚Äì of Zinfandel grapes were shipped, compared to 6000 cars of Alicante Bouschet. =Rediscovery after Prohibition (1933‚Äìpresent)= By 1930, the wine industry had weakened due to the Great Depression and Prohibition.Pinney, p10 Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines. By the middle of the 20th century the origins of California Zinfandel had been forgotten. In 1972, one British wine writer wrote, \\"there is a fascinating Californian grape, the zinfandel, said to have come from Hungary, but apparently a c√©page now unknown there.\\" In 1974 and 1981, American wine writers described it as \\"a California original, grown nowhere else\\", page 199 and \\"California's own red grape\\". In 1972, Bob Trinchero of the Sutter Home Winery decided to try draining some juice from the vats in order to impart more tannins and color to his Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel. He vinified this juice as a dry wine, and tried to sell it under the name of Oeil de Perdrix, a Swiss wine made by this saign√©e method. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms insisted on an English translation, so he added \\"White Zinfandel\\" to the name, and sold 220 cases. At the time, demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes, encouraging other California producers to make \\"white\\" wine from red grapes, with minimal skin contact. However, in 1975, Trinchero's wine experienced a stuck fermentation, a problem in which the yeast dies off before all the sugar is converted to alcohol. He put the wine aside for two weeks, then tasted it and decided to sell this pinker, sugary wine. Just as Mateus Ros√© had become a huge success in Europe after World War II, this medium sweet White Zinfandel became immensely popular. White Zinfandel still accounts for 9.9% of U.S. wine sales by volume (6.3% by value), six times the sales of red Zinfandel. Most white Zinfandel is made from grapes grown for that purpose in California's Central Valley. Wine critics considered white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels have more fruit and less cloying sweetness. Nevertheless, the success of this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own at the end of the 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same (red) grapes, processed in a different way.  Relationship to Primitivo, Crljenak Ka≈°telanski and Tribidrag  A vine of Crljenak Ka≈°telanski, in the vineyard where it was discovered. The metal tag from the University of Zagreb indicates that this vine is reserved for genetic research. Zinfandel was long considered \\"America's vine and wine\\", but when University of California, Davis (UCD) professor Austin Goheen visited Italy in 1967, he noticed how wine made from Primitivo reminded him of Zinfandel. Others also made the connection about that time. Primitivo was brought to California in 1968, and ampelographers declared it identical to Zinfandel in 1972. The first wine made from these California vines in 1975 also seemed identical to Zinfandel. In 1975, PhD student Wade Wolfe showed that the two varieties had identical isozyme fingerprints. Dr. Lamberti of Bari had suggested to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo might be the Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali was the same as Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb. In 1993, Meredith used a DNA fingerprinting technique to confirm that Primitivo and Zinfandel are clones of the same variety. Comparative field trials have found that \\"Primitivo selections were generally superior to those of Zinfandel, having earlier fruit maturity, similar or higher yield, and similar or lower bunch rot susceptibility.\\" ‚Äì press coverage of the Fidelibus research. This is consistent with the theory that Primitivo was selected as an early-ripening clone of a Croatian grape. By 1998, Meredith's team realized that Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel but rather that one was the parent of the other. In 2000 they discovered that Primitivo/Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali. The other parent of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejiƒá and Edi Maletiƒá (University of Zagreb) to be Dobriƒçiƒá, an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of ≈†olta. This discovery narrowed down the search to the central Dalmatian coastal strip and its offshore islands. Eventually a matching DNA fingerprint was found among the samples. The match came from a vine sampled in 2001 in the vineyard of Ivica Raduniƒá in Ka≈°tel Novi. This Crljenak Ka≈°telanski (\\"Ka≈°tela Red\\") appears to represent Primitivo/Zinfandel in its original home, although some genetic divergence may have occurred since their separation. Meredith now refers to the variety as \\"ZPC\\" ‚Äì Zinfandel / Primitivo / Crljenak Ka≈°telanski. This Croatian vineyard contained just nine Crljenak Ka≈°telanski vines mixed with thousands of other vines. In 2002, additional vines known locally as Pribidrag were found in the Dalmatian coastal town of Omi≈°. Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards, although virus infections have delayed their release. The first Croatian ZPC wine was made by Edi Maletiƒá in 2005. Meanwhile, plantings of Primitivo have increased in California, where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling. Its wines are reputed to have more blackberry and spice flavors. In the 2012 book Wine Grapes Masters of wine Jancis Robinson and Julia Harding and Swiss grape geneticist Dr. Jos√© Vouillamoz detail the search for Zinfandel's origins. After years of research and DNA testing of vines from vineyards across the globe, a single 90-year-old grape vine from the garden of an elderly lady in Split, Croatia, provided the evidence to show that Zinfandel was a Croatian grape that has been known as Tribidrag since at least the 15th century. =Legal issues= Local wine-labeling regulations are slowly catching up with the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers have taken advantage of these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as approved grape varieties for American wines, but they are not listed as synonyms; U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognized as synonyms. In July 2008, the proposed regulation (RIN 1513‚ÄìAA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) was withdrawn.  Distribution and wines  = United States = Gnarly zinfandel grapes in Sonoma, California, in the winter Zinfandel is grown across the continental United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles that range from late harvest dessert wines, ros√©s (White Zinfandel) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine in the style of port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the winemaker. Historically, California Zinfandel vines were planted as a field blend interspersed with Durif (Petite Sirah), Carignan, Grenache, Mourv√®dre, Mission and Muscat. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their Zinfandel wines. Zinfandel is grown on approximately 11% of California's vineyard land area. Around 400,000 short tons (350,000 tonnes) are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing Zinfandel third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot. California regions An old vine Zinfandel from the Lodi AVA of California A Zinfandel from Amador County In California, 20% of the Zinfandel-growing counties hold 80% of the Zinfandel growing area; however, major producing areas such as San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, and Madera County produce Zinfandel primarily for blends or jug wine. Certain California regions are regarded as \\"exceptional\\" for Zinfandel, each with identifiable flavor characteristics: * Amador has a reputation for big, full- bodied Zinfandel. These extra-ripe wines have been called jammy, briary, and brambly, having aromas of sweet berries. * Although the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA in Santa Clara Valley produces Zinfandel from just , the Zinfandel from that region is known for its complexity and depth. * Sonoma county has a Zinfandel-producing land area second only to that of San Joaquin County. The county contains the warm Dry Creek Valley AVA, known for its juicy Zinfandel with bright fruit, balanced acidity and notes of blackberry, anise and pepper. Dry Creek Valley produces Zinfandel in a variety of styles ranging from the high-alcohol Amador style to balanced, spicy wines. * San Luis Obispo, particularly the Paso Robles AVA with its hot days and cool maritime evenings, produces Zinfandel known for being soft and round. * While the Napa Valley AVA is known primarily for its Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah, Napa also produces Zinfandel wines described as plummy and intense, tasting of red berry fruits with cedar and vanilla. Zinfandel in Napa tends to be made in a claret style like red Bordeaux. * The Russian River Valley generally produces well during warm vintages. Otherwise, the grapes do not fully ripen, leaving the wines with excessive acidity. The area has mostly \\"old vine\\" Zinfandel, characterized as spicy and somewhat lower in alcohol than Zinfandel from other regions. * Mendocino County Zinfandel wines have been considered high quality, but they are less known because they are not heavily marketed. * Lodi has some of the oldest Zinfandel vines in California. While often used for White Zinfandel production, in the red style, Lodi Zinfandels have a reputation for being juicy and approachable. = Italy = Most Primitivo is grown in Apulia, a coastal region known as the \\"heel\\" of Italy, and it is estimated to be the country's 12th most widely planted grape variety. The main three DOC areas are Primitivo di Manduria, Gioia del Colle Primitivo (Riserva) and Falerno del Massico Primitivo (Riserva o Vecchio). The Manduria DOC covers still red wine as well as sweet (Dolce Naturale) and fortified (Liquoroso Dolce Naturale, Liquoroso Secco) wine. Falerno requires a minimum of 85% Primitivo; the others are 100% Primitivo. Gioia del Colle Rosso and Rosato contain 50‚Äì60% Primitivo, and Cilento Rosso/Rosato contains around 15%. Historically, the grape was fermented and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, where it was used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel. =Other locations= The Croatian form Crljenak Ka≈°telanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its own right before the link to Zinfandel was revealed. UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maletiƒá in Croatia, which he planted on the island of Hvar. He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005. There is high demand for red grapes in the country, and the government has been supportive of ongoing research. Figures from the department of viticulture and enology at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Ka≈°telanski in Croatia in 2001, there were about 2,000 vines in 2008. Old vine Zinfandel plantings dating from the 1930s have been found in Baja California, Mexico. There are also small Zinfandel plantings in Western Australia, Mudgee in New South Wales and the McLaren Vale area of South Australia. South Africa has a small production of Zinfandel, including one estate rated among the country's Zinfandel producers and winner of an international prize.  Viticulture and winemaking  Zinfandel grapes during veraison Zinfandel wine aging in barrels Zinfandel vines are quite vigorous and grow best in climates that are warm but not too hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised for its ability to reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill. The grapes exhibit an uneven pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, over-ripe grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these varying levels of ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in the high cost of some Zinfandels. Red Zinfandel wines have been criticized for being too \\"hot\\" (too alcoholic), although modern winemaking techniques have helped make them more approachable. On the other hand, Zinfandel producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood believe that alcohol-removing technologies, such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones, remove a sense of terroir from the wine. If a wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15% alcohol, Peterson argues, it should be accepted on its own terms. Factors that affect the wine's flavors include length of fermentation, length of the maceration period with skin contact, the level of oak aging, and the degrees Brix of the harvested grapes. White Zinfandel is normally harvested early at 20¬∞Bx when the grapes have yet to develop much varietal character, though some examples can develop hints of tobacco and apple skin. At 23¬∞Bx (the degree that most red wine is considered \\"ripe\\"), strawberry flavors develop. Cherry flavors appear at 24¬∞Bx followed by blackberry notes at 25¬∞Bx.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 23 November 1920 ‚Äì c. 20 April 1970) was a Romanian-born German-language poet and translator. He was born as Paul Antschel to a Jewish family in CernƒÉu»õi (German: Czernowitz), in the then Kingdom of Romania (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine), and adopted the pseudonym \\"Paul Celan\\". He became one of the major German-language poets of the post‚ÄìWorld War II era. Life =Early life= Celan was born into a German-speaking Jewish family in CernƒÉu»õi, Bukovina, a region then part of Romania and earlier part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (when his birthplace was known as Czernowitz). His first home was in the Wassilkogasse in CernƒÉu»õi. His father, Leo Antschel, was a Zionist who advocated his son's education in Hebrew at the Jewish school Safah Ivriah (meaning The Hebrew language). Celan's mother, Fritzi, was an avid reader of German literature who insisted German be the language of the house. In his teens Celan became active in Jewish Socialist organizations and fostered support for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. His earliest known poem is titled Mother's Day 1938. Paul attended the Liceul Ortodox de BƒÉie»õi No. 1 (Boys' Orthodox Secondary School No. 1) from 1930 until 1935, Liceul de BƒÉie»õi No. 2 √Æn CernƒÉu»õi (Boys' Secondary School No. 2 in CernƒÉu»õi) from 1935 to 1936,Celan, Paul, and Axel Gellhaus. Paul Antschel/Paul Celan in Czernowitz, Deutsche Schillergesellschafy 2001 . followed by the Liceul Marele Voievod Mihai (Great Prince Mihai Preparatory School, now Chernivtsi School No. 5), where he studied from 1936 until graduating in 1938. At this time Celan secretly began to write poetry. In 1938 Celan traveled to Tours, France, to study medicine. The Anschluss precluded his study in Vienna, and Romanian schools were harder to get into due to the newly imposed Jewish quota. His journey to France took him through Berlin as the events of Kristallnacht unfolded, and also introduced him to his uncle, Bruno Schrager, who was later among the French detainees who died at Birkenau. Celan returned to CernƒÉu≈£i in 1939 to study literature and Romance languages. =Life during World War II= Following the Soviet occupation of Bukovina in June 1940, deportations to Siberia started. A year later following the reconquest of Romania, Nazi Germany and the then fascist Romanian regime brought ghettos, internment, and forced labour (see Romania during World War II). On arrival in CernƒÉu»õi in July 1941, the German SS Einsatzkommando and their Romanian allies set the city's Great Synagogue on fire. In October, the Romanians deported a large number of Jews after forcing them into a ghetto, where Celan translated Shakespeare's Sonnets and continued to write his own poetry. Before the ghetto was dissolved in the fall of that year, Celan was pressed into labor, first clearing the debris of a demolished post office, and then gathering and destroying Russian books. The local mayor strove to mitigate the harsh circumstances, until the governor of Bukovina had the Jews rounded up and deported, starting on a Saturday night in June 1942. Celan hoped to convince his parents to leave the country so as to escape certain persecution. While Celan was away from home, on June 21, 1942, his parents were taken from their home and sent by train to an internment camp in Transnistria Governorate, where two-thirds of the deportees eventually perished. Celan's father likely perished of typhus and his mother was shot after being exhausted by forced labour. Later that year, after having himself been taken to a labour camp in Romania, Celan would receive reports of his parents' deaths. Celan remained imprisoned in a work-camp until February 1944, when the Red Army's advance forced the Romanians to abandon the camps, whereupon he returned to CernƒÉu≈£i shortly before the Soviets returned. There, he worked briefly as a nurse in the mental hospital. Friends from this period recall Celan expressing immense guilt over his separation from his parents, whom he had tried to convince to go into hiding prior to the deportations, shortly before their deaths. =Life after the war= Considering emigration to Palestine, Celan left CernƒÉu≈£i in 1945 for Bucharest, where he remained until 1947. He was active in the Jewish literary community as both a translator of Russian literature into Romanian, and as a poet, publishing his work under a variety of pseudonyms. The literary scene of the time was richly populated with surrealists ‚Äì Gellu Naum, Ilarie Voronca, Gherasim Luca, Paul PƒÉun, and Dolfi Trost ‚Äì and it was in this period that Celan developed pseudonyms both for himself and his friends, including the one he took as his pen name. Here he also met with the poets Rose Ausl√§nder and Emannuel Weissglas, elements of whose works he would reuse in his poem \\"Todesfuge\\" (1944‚Äì5). A version of Celan's poem \\"Todesfuge\\" appeared as \\"\\" (\\"Death Tango\\") in a Romanian translation of May 1947. Additional remarks were published explaining that the dancing and musical performances evoked in the poem were images of realities of the extermination camp life. =Exodus and Paris years= On the emergence of the communist regime in Romania, Celan fled Romania for Vienna, Austria. It was there that he befriended Ingeborg Bachmann, who had just completed a dissertation on Martin Heidegger. Facing a city divided between occupying powers and with little resemblance to the mythic capital it once was, which had harboured the (now) shattered Austro-Hungarian Jewish community, he moved to Paris in 1948. In that year his first poetry collection, Der Sand aus den Urnen (\\"Sand from the Urns\\"), was published in Vienna by A. Sexl. His first few years in Paris were marked by intense feelings of loneliness and isolation, as expressed in letters to his colleagues, including his longtime friend from CernƒÉu≈£i, Petre Solomon. It was also during this time that he exchanged many letters with Diet Kloos, a young Dutch singer and anti-Nazi resister who saw her husband of a few months tortured to death. She visited him twice in Paris between 1949 and 1951. In 1952, Celan's writing began to gain recognition when he read his poetry on his first reading trip to GermanyPaul Celan By Paul Celan, Pierre Joris where he was invited to read at the semiannual meetings of Group 47.Paul Celan and Martin Heidegger: an unresolved conversation, 1951‚Äì1970, p. 22 At their May meeting he read his poem Todesfuge (\\"Death Fugue\\"), a depiction of concentration camp life. When Ingeborg Bachmann, with whom Celan had an affair, won the group's prize for her collection ' (The Extended Hours), Celan (whose work had received only six votes) said \\"After the meeting, only six people remembered my name\\". He did not attend any other meeting of the group. The grave of Paul Celan at the Cimeti√®re de Thiais near Paris In November 1951, he met the graphic artist Gis√®le Lestrange, in Paris. He sent her many love letters, influenced by Franz Kafka's correspondence with Milena Jesensk√° and Felice Bauer. They married on December 21, 1952, despite the opposition of her aristocratic family. During the following 18 years they wrote over 700 letters; amongst the active correspondents of Celan were Hermann Lenz and his wife, Hanne.See: Paul Celan, Hanne und Hermann Lenz: Briefwechsel, ed. von Barbara Wiedemann (and others). Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2001. He made his living as a translator and lecturer in German at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. He was a close friend of Nelly Sachs, who later won the Nobel Prize for literature. Celan became a French citizen in 1955 and lived in Paris. Celan's sense of persecution increased after the widow of a friend, the French-German poet Yvan Goll, unjustly accused him of having plagiarised her husband's work.Hamburger p. xxiii. For detail on this traumatic event, see Felstiner, Paul Celan, op. cit. pp. 72, 154‚Äì55, a literary biography from which much in this entry's pages is derived. Celan was awarded the Bremen Literature Prize in 1958 and the Georg B√ºchner Prize in 1960.Collected prose / By Paul Celan, Rosemarie Waldrop Celan committed suicide by drowning in the Seine river in Paris, around April 20, 1970. Poetry and poetics The death of his parents and the experience of the Shoah (The Holocaust) are defining forces in Celan's poetry and his use of language. In his Bremen Prize speech, Celan said of language after Auschwitz that: Celan also said: \\"There is nothing in the world for which a poet will give up writing, not even when he is a Jew and the language of his poems is German.\\"Felstiner, op. cit., p. 56. His most famous poem, the early \\"Todesfuge\\", is a work of great complexity and power, which may have drawn some key motifs from the poem \\"ER\\" by , another Czernovitz poet.Enzo Rostagno \\"Paul Celan et la po√©sie de la destruction\\" in \\"L'Histoire d√©chir√©e. Essai sur Auschwitz et les intellectuels\\", Les √âditions du Cerf 1997 (), in French. The characters of Margarete and Sulamith, with their respectively golden and ashen hair, can be interpreted as a reflection of Celan's Jewish-German culture, while the blue-eyed \\"Master from Germany\\" embodies German Nazism. In later years his poetry became progressively more cryptic, fractured and monosyllabic, bearing comparison to the music of Anton Webern. He also increased his use of German neologisms, especially in his later works Fadensonnen (\\"Threadsuns\\") and Lichtzwang. In the eyes of some, Celan attempted in his poetry either to destroy or remake the German language. For others, he retained a sense for the lyricism of the German language which was rare in writers of that time. As he writes in a letter to his wife Gis√®le Lestrange on one of his trips to Germany: \\"The German I talk is not the same as the language the German people are talking here\\". Writing in German was a way for him to think back and remember his parents, particularly his mother, from whom he had learned the language. This is underlined in \\"\\" (Lupin), a poem in which Paul Celan addresses his mother. The urgency and power of Celan's work stem from his attempt to find words \\"after\\", to bear (impossible) witness in a language that gives back no words \\"for that which happened\\". In addition to writing poetry (in German and, earlier, in Romanian), he was an extremely active translator and polyglot, translating literature from Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Hebrew, and English into German. Awards * Bremen Literature Prize 1958 * Georg B√ºchner Prize 1960  Significance  Based on the reception of his work, it could be suggested that Celan, along with Goethe, H√∂lderlin and Rilke, is one of the most significant German poets who ever lived. Despite the difficulty of his work, his poetry is thoroughly researched, the total number of scholarly papers numbering in the thousands. Many contemporary philosophers, including Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, Hans-Georg Gadamer and others have devoted at least one of their books to his writing.

Fishers may be professional or recreational. Fishing has existed as a means of obtaining food since the Mesolithic period.Early humans followed the coast BBC News articles  History  Egyptians bringing in fish and splitting them for salting Fishing has existed as a means of obtaining food since the Mesolithic period. Fishing had become a major means of survival as well as a business venture.Fisheries history Fishing and the fisherman have also influenced Ancient Egyptian religion; mullets were worshipped as a sign of the arriving flood season. Bastet was often manifested in the form of a catfish. In ancient Egyptian literature, the process that Amun used to create the world is associated with the tilapia's method of mouth-brooding. Commerce According to the FAO, there were about 39 million fishers in countries producing more than 200,000 tonnes in 2012, which is nearly 140% the number in 1995. The total fishery production of 66 million tonnes equated to an average productivity of 3.5 tonnes per person. Most of this growth took place in Asian countries, where four-fifths of world fishers and fish farmers dwell.FAO: Fishing people. Retrieved 7 July 2008. Most fishermen are men involved in offshore and deep-sea fisheries. Women fish in some regions inshore from small boats or collect shellfish and seaweed. In many artisanal fishing communities, women are responsible for making and repairing nets, post-harvest processing and marketing. Recreation Recreational fishing is fishing for pleasure or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is fishing for economic profit, or subsistence fishing, which is fishing for survival. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits. Lures are frequently used in place of bait. Some people make handmade lures, including plastic lures and artificial flies. The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is called angling. When angling, it is sometimes expected or required that the fish be caught and released. Big-game fishing is fishing from boats to catch large open-water species such as tuna, sharks and marlin. Noodling and trout tickling are also recreational activities. Communities For some communities, fishing provides not only a source of food and work but also community and cultural identity.International Collective in Support of Fishworkers (ICSF) Safety issues A Royal Air Force search and rescue Sea King helicopter comes to the aid of the French fishing vessel Alf during a storm in the Irish Sea. The fishing industry is hazardous for fishermen. Between 1992 and 1999, US commercial fishing vessels averaged 78 deaths per year. The main contributors to fatalities are:FAO Profile for the USA * inadequate preparation for emergencies * poor vessel maintenance and inadequate safety equipment * lack of awareness of or ignoring stability issues. Many fishermen, while accepting that fishing is dangerous, staunchly defend their independence. Many proposed laws and additional regulation to increase safety have been defeated because fishermen oppose them. Alaska's commercial fishermen work in one of the world's harshest environments. Many of the hardships they endure include isolated fishing grounds, high winds, seasonal darkness, very cold water, icing, and short fishing seasons, where very long work days are the norm. Fatigue, physical stress, and financial pressures face most Alaska fishermen through their careers. Out of 948 work- related deaths that took place in Alaska during 1990-2006, one-third (311) occurred to fishermen. This is equivalent to an estimated annual fatality rate of 128/100,000 workers/year. This fatality rate is 26 times that of the overall U.S. work-related fatality rate of approximately 5/100,000 workers/year for the same time period. While the work-related fatality rate for commercial fishermen in Alaska is still very high, it does appear to be decreasing: since 1990, there has been a 51 percent decline in the annual fatality rate. The successes in commercial fishing are due in part to the U.S. Coast Guard implementing new safety requirements in the early 1990s. These safety requirements contributed to 96 percent of the commercial fishermen surviving vessel sinkings/capsizings in 2004, whereas in 1991, only 73 percent survived. While the number of occupational deaths in commercial fishermen in Alaska has been reduced, there is a continuing pattern of losing 20 to 40 vessels every year. There are still about 100 fishermen who must be rescued each year from cold Alaska waters. Successful rescue is still dependent on the expertly trained personnel of the US Coast Guard Search and Rescue operations, and such efforts can be hindered by the harshness of seas and the weather. Furthermore, the people involved in Search and Rescue operations are themselves at considerable risk for injury or death during these rescue attempts.

His mother moved the family to Cedar Rapids after his father died in 1901. Soon thereafter, Wood began as an apprentice in a local metal shop. After graduating from Washington High School, Wood enrolled in The Handicraft Guild, an art school run entirely by women in Minneapolis in 1910 (now a prominent artist collective in the city). He is said to have later returned to the Guild to paint American Gothic. A year later, Wood returned to Iowa, where he taught in a rural one-room schoolhouse.\\"Grant Wood\\", answers.com In 1913, he enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and performed some work as a silversmith. From 1922 to 1928, Wood made four trips to Europe, where he studied many styles of painting, especially Impressionism and post-Impressionism. However, it was the work of the 15th-century Flemish artist Jan van Eyck that influenced him to take on the clarity of this technique and to incorporate it in his new works. Career From 1922 to 1935, Wood lived with his mother in the loft of a carriage house in Cedar Rapids, which he turned into his personal studio at \\"5 Turner Alley\\" (the studio had no address until Wood made one up). In 1932, Wood helped found the Stone City Art Colony near his hometown to help artists get through the Great Depression. He became a great proponent of regionalism in the arts, lecturing throughout the country on the topic. As his classically American image was solidified, his bohemian days in Paris were expunged from his public persona.Maslin, Janet (October 3, 2010). \\"Behind That Humble Pitchfork, a Complex Artist\\" (review of R.

It is thought that he was a closeted homosexual, and that there was an attempt on the part of a senior colleague, Lester Longman, to get him fired both on moral grounds and for his advocacy of regionalism.

This included painting advertisements, sketching rooms of a mortuary house for promotional flyers and, in one case, designing the corn-themed decor (including chandelier) for the dining room of a hotel. In addition, his 1928 trip to Munich was to oversee the making of the stained glass windows he had designed for a Veterans Memorial Building in Cedar Rapids. The window was damaged during the 2008 flood and it is currently in the process of restoration.http://www.gazetteonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Date=20090118&Category;=NEWS&ArtNo;=701189924&Template;=printart He again returned to Cedar Rapids to teach junior high students after serving in the army as a camouflage painter. =Regionalism= Wood is associated with the American movement of Regionalism, which was primarily situated in the Midwest, and advanced figurative painting of rural American themes in an aggressive rejection of European abstraction. Wood was one of three artists most associated with the movement. The others, John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton, returned to the Midwest in the 1930s due to Wood's encouragement and assistance with locating teaching positions for them at colleges in Wisconsin and Missouri, respectively. Along with Benton, Curry, and other Regionalist artists, Wood's work was marketed through Associated American Artists in New York for many years. Wood is considered the patron artist of Cedar Rapids, and his childhood country school is depicted on the 2004 Iowa State Quarter. =American Gothic= Grant Wood, American Gothic (1930), Art Institute of Chicago Wood's best known work is his 1930 painting American Gothic, which is also one of the most famous paintings in American art, and one of the few images to reach the status of widely recognised cultural icon, comparable to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Edvard Munch's The Scream.Fineman, Mia, The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates., Slate, June 8, 2005 American Gothic was first exhibited in 1930 at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it is still located.

Art critics who had favorable opinions about the painting, such as Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of repression and narrow-mindedness of rural small-town life. It was seen as part of the trend toward increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of such novels as Sherwood Anderson's 1919 Winesburg, Ohio, Sinclair Lewis' 1920 Main Street, and Carl Van Vechten's The Tattooed Countess. Wood rejected this reading of it. With the onset of the Great Depression, it came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit. Another reading is that it is an ambiguous fusion of reverence and parody. Wood's inspiration came from Eldon, southern Iowa, where a cottage designed in the Gothic Revival style with an upper window in the shape of a medieval pointed arch provided the background and also the painting's title. Wood decided to paint the house along with \\"the kind of people I fancied should live in that house.\\" The painting shows a farmer standing beside his spinster daughter, figures modeled by the artist's sister, Nan (1900‚Äì1990), and his dentist. Wood's sister insisted that the painting depicts the farmer's daughter and not wife, disliking suggestions it was the farmer's wife, since that would mean that she looks older than Wood's sister preferred to think of herself. The dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby (1867‚Äì1950), was from Cedar Rapids. The woman is dressed in a dark print apron mimicking 19th-century Americana with a cameo brooch. The couple are in the traditional roles of men and women, the man's pitchfork symbolizing hard labor. The compositional severity and detailed technique derive from Northern Renaissance paintings, which Grant had looked at during three visits to Europe; after this he became increasingly aware of the Midwest's own legacy, which also informs the work. It is a key image of Regionalism. Wood was hired in 1940, along with eight other prominent American artists, to document and interpret dramatic scenes and characters during the production of the film The Long Voyage Home, a cinematic adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's plays.\\"Cover Article, American Artist Magazine, September, 1940, pp. 4-14\\"  Gallery  File:Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.jpgThe Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, 1931, MoMA File:Daughters of Revolution.jpgDaughters of Revolution, 1932, Cincinnati Art Museum File:Parson Weems' Fable.jpgParson Weems' Fable, 1939, Amon Carter Museum File:'Sentimental Ballad' by Grant Wood, 1940.jpgSentimental Ballad, 1940, New Britain Museum File:'January' by Grant Wood, 1940-41, Cleveland Museum of Art.JPGJanuary, 1940‚Äì41, Cleveland Museum of Art  List of works  = Paintings = *Spotted Man (1924) *Fall Plowing, Grant Wood The Little Chapel Chancelade (1926) *Woman with Plants (1929) *American Gothic (1930) *Arnold Comes of Age (1930) *Stone City, Iowa (1930) *Appraisal (1931) *Young Corn (1931) *Fall Plowing (1931) *The Birthplace of Herbert Hoover, West Branch, Iowa (1931) *The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere (1931) *Plaid Sweater (1931) *Self-Portrait (1932) *Arbor Day (1932) *Boy Milking Cow (1932) *Daughters of Revolution (1932) *Portrait of Nan (1933) *Near Sundown (1933) *Dinner for Threshers (1934) *Return from Bohemia (1935) *Death on Ridge Road (1935) *Spring Turning (1936) *Seedtime and Harvest (1937) *Sultry Night (1937) *Haying (1939) *New Road (1939) *Parson Weems' Fable (1939) *January (1940) *Iowa Cornfield (1941) *Spring in the Country (1941) = Writing = * Wood, Grant. \\"Art in the Daily Life of the Child.\\" Rural America, March 1940, 7‚Äì9. * Revolt against the City.

He is widely regarded as the greatest jockey in the history of American Thoroughbred horse racing. Arcaro was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of an impoverished taxi driver. His parents, Pasquale and Josephine, were Italian immigrants and his father held a number of jobs, including taxi driver and operator of an illegal liquor enterprise during Prohibition. Arcaro was born prematurely, and weighed just three pounds at birth; because of this, he was smaller than his classmates and was rejected when he tried out for a spot on a baseball team. His full height would reach just five-foot, two inches. Eventually nicknamed \\"Banana Nose\\" by his confreres, Arcaro won his first race in 1932 at the Agua Caliente racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico; he was 16 years old. In 1934, the inaugural year of Narragansett Park, Arcaro was a comparative unknown who rode many of his early career races at 'Gansett.Daily Racing Form 6/29/53 American classic races Arcaro won his first Kentucky Derby in 1938 aboard Lawrin. He is tied with Bill Hartack for most Derby wins with five, and has the most wins in the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes with six. He won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1941 on Whirlaway and again in 1948 on Citation. His other Kentucky Derby wins were Hoop Jr. (1945) and Hill Gail (1952). Major stakes wins Arcaro also won the Suburban Handicap eight times, the Wood Memorial Stakes nine times and the Jockey Club Gold Cup ten times. In international competition, at old Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Arcaro won the 1953 Queen's Plate (Canada's most prestigious race); at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland, he won the 1954 Washington, D.C. International against the best horses and riders from Europe. In 1953 Arcaro was voted the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, and in 1958 he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. Active in jockey affairs, Arcaro was a driving force behind the creation of the Jockeys' Guild. He retired in 1962, due to severe bursitis in his arm. During his career Arcaro rode in 24,092 races and won 4,779, with record setting earnings of $30,039,543. After working as a television commentator on racing for CBS and ABC, he was a public relations officer for the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas before retiring to Miami, Florida. He also worked as a spokesman for the Buick Motor Division of General Motors, for which he voiced the well-known phrase \\"If you price a Buick, you'll buy a Buick.\\" For many years, he was the proprietor of a popular Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills. Arcaro died in 1997. His body was cremated and his ashes were interred in the columbarium at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Cemetery in Miami. Today, he remains one of the best-known jockeys in the history of horse racing, called \\"the Master\\" for his riding skills, good sense of pace and the ability to switch his whip from one hand to the other with ease during a race.Eddie Arcaro at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Retrieved 2011-09-29.

While the daily routine in the monastery requires the monks to meditate several hours a day, during a sesshin they devote themselves almost exclusively to zazen practice. The numerous 30- to 50-minute-long meditation periods are interleaved with short rest breaks, meals, and sometimes short periods of work (Japanese: ‰ΩúÂãô samu) all performed with the same mindfulness; nightly sleep is kept to a minimum, at six hours or fewer. During the sesshin period, the meditation practice is occasionally interrupted by the master giving public talks (teisho) and individual direction in private meetings (which may be called dokusan, daisan, or sanzen) with a Zen Master. In modern Buddhist practice in Japan and the West, sesshins are often attended by lay students, and are typically one, three, five, or seven days in length. Seven-day sesshins are held several times a year at many Zen centers, especially in commemoration of the Buddha's awakening to full enlightenment (anuttarƒÅ-samyak-sa·πÉbodhi). At this Rohatsu sesshin, practitioners seek to relax and quiet the mind to the point of cessation of mental chatter and emotional impulse, samadhi, kensho, or satori.  A typical sesshin day  A sesshin schedule in the West will typically allow anywhere from nine to fifteen periods of zazen per day, 30‚Äì40 minutes each, with ten-minute periods of walking meditation (kinhin) between zazen periods. Traditional sesshin are more intensive, with meditations lasting 30‚Äì60 minutes each, with an absence of any rest or work breaks and sleep limited to less than five hours a day. Meals are taken in a formal meditation ritual of oryoki. Work periods in westernized sesshin are sometimes scheduled and may comprise one to two hours of the day, usually in gardening, cooking, or cleaning. The sesshin schedule typically allows for four to five hours of sleep per night, though practitioners occasionally will spend much of the next-to-last night of a five- or seven-day sesshin in zazen. This is called yaza and is much revered as a particularly effective time to meditate when the thinking mind and ego lack the energy to derail practice. It has been reported that at least three days of sesshin are usually required for the practitioner to \\"settle down\\" into the sesshin routine to a point where the mind becomes quiet enough for the deeper types of meditation and samadhi to begin. Psychological aspects of sesshin Some people unfamiliar with the process have reported becoming disoriented and fearful of incurring psychological damage during sesshin. Some Zen centers do not allow novices to attend long sesshins without much prior experience and screening by the practice leaders.‚ÄîKrishna (1971), p. 164 Sesshin can lead to deep experiences of awakening that may at times be somewhat traumatic, akin to a \\"spiritual emergency\\" or symptoms of Kundalini Syndrome. While this may seem daunting at first, people who practice regular zazen do not usually have problems with sesshin. Heightening of senses may arise during sesshin. Sometimes practitioners report that food has incredible flavor and colors become more vivid and pronounced.Definition of the term \\"pranotthana\\": \\"Intensified, uplifted life energy\\" (Sovatsky, 1998:153), \\"The perception of energy movement\\" (Bynum, 1996: 260). http://www.tenzo.org/sesshin Social aspects of sesshin There is no talking during sesshin. Silence is observed so that each student may both concentrate on their experience and not influence those of others. At the end of the sesshin there is usually a meal when students are allowed to talk to others for the first time since arriving.

They are usually kept for companionship or enjoyment. People may keep a digital pet in lieu of a real pet. Cyberpet and Tamagotchi were some of the first popular digital pets. Digital pets have no concrete physical form other than the hardware they run on. Interaction with virtual pets may or may not be goal oriented. If it is, then the user must keep it alive as long as possible and often help it to grow into higher forms. Keeping the pet alive and growing often requires feeding, grooming and playing with the pet. Digital pets can be simulations of real animals, as in the Petz series, or fantasy ones, like the Tamagotchi or Digimon series. Unlike biological simulations, the pet does not usually reproduce. Types =Web-based= Virtual pet sites are usually free to play for all who sign up. They can be accessed through web browsers and often include a virtual community, such as Neopia in Neopets. In these worlds, a user can play games to earn virtual money which is usually spent on items and food for pets. One large branch of virtual pet games are sim horse games. Some sites adopt out pets to put on a webpage and use for role-playing in chat rooms. They often require the adoptee to have a page ready for their pet. Sometimes they have a setup for breeding one's pets and then adopting them out. Some sites use quests in order for users to make points and receive items. Some quests can give stat points to the user's pets for when they are battling. These sites, and their clones, have a single non-dynamic image for each pet and its various colors, leading to a lot of similarity in the pets. There are also \\"simulation sites\\" where the webpage attempts to simulate a real-life discipline, such as horse dressage or pedigree dog showing. Often these sites will also have a breeding aspect, including genetics and markings. Other simulation sites focus mostly on the markings. =Software-based= There are many video games that focus on the care, raising, breeding or exhibition of simulated animals. Such games are described as a sub-class of life simulation game. Since the computing power is more powerful than with webpage or gadget based digital pets, these are usually able to achieve a higher level of visual effects and interactivity. Pet-raising simulations often lack a victory condition or challenge, and can be classified as software toys. The pet may be capable of learning to do a variety of tasks. \\"This quality of rich intelligence distinguishes artificial pets from other kinds of A-life, in which individuals have simple rules but the population as a whole develops emergent properties\\". For artificial pets, their behaviors are typically \\"preprogrammed and are not truly emergent\\". A screen mate is a downloadable virtual pet that creates a small animation that walks around a computer desktop and over open screens unpredictably. Each pets is a small animation of an animal (such as a sheep or a frog, or in some cases a human or bottle cap) that can be interacted by clicking on or dragging, which lifts the pet as if you were picking it up. Most screen mates are free to download and used for entertainment purposes. History PF Magic released the first widely popular virtual pets in 1995 with Dogz, followed by Catz in the spring of 1996, eventually becoming a franchise known as Petz. The digital pets were further popularized when Tamagotchi and Digimon were introduced in 1996 and 1997. Digital pets were a massive fad in Japan, and to a lesser extent in the United States and United Kingdom during the late 1990s. Today, there are also \\"Digital Pets\\" which have physical robotic bodies, known as Ludobots or Entertainment robots. Controversy The popularity of virtual pets in the United States, and the constant need for attention the pets required, led to them being banned from schools across the country, a move that hastened the virtual pet's decline from popularity. A Mad cover on regular issue #362, October 1997 shows a gun being pointed at a virtual pet with Alfred E. Neuman's face and the line \\"If you don't buy this magazine, we'll kill this virtual pet!\\" Illustrated by Mark Fredrickson. The cover parodies the January 1973 issue of National Lampoon which depicted a gun being held to a real dog's head and the line, \\"If you don't buy this magazine, we'll kill this dog.\\"MAD Cover Site, MAD #362 October 1997. =Digital pets over real pets= Some people suggest that digital pets are preferable for a number of reasons. Having a digital pet in place of a real pet ensures real pets do not have to suffer, and it is arguably training before adopting a real pet. PETA has suggested that robotic animals can help people recognize that they are not up to the commitment of caring for a real animal.G. Jeffrey, \\"If you kick a robotic dog, is it wrong?\\" in The Christian Science Monitor, Feb of 2004 Another argument is that the digital pet can successfully substitute a real one for children who cannot care for a real pet, such as those who suffer from allergies. Relationship with digital pet There is research concerning the relationship between digital pets and their owners, and their impact on the emotions of people. For example, Furby affects the way people think about their identity, and many children think that Furby is alive in a \\"Furby kind of way\\" in Sherry Turkle's research.Katie Hafner, What Do You Mean, \`It's Just Like a Real Dog'? , 2000 Common features There are many common features between different digital pets, some of them are used to give a sense of reality to the user (such as the pet responding to \\"touch\\"), and some for enhancing playability (such as training). =Communication= With advanced video gaming technology, most modern digital pets do not show a message box nor icon to display the pet's internal variable, health state or emotion like earlier generations (such as Tamagotchi). Instead, users can only understand the pet by interpreting their actions, body language, facial expressions, etc. This helps to make a pet's behavior seem natural, rather than calculated, and fosters a feeling of a relationship between user and digital pet. =Sense of reality= To give a sense of reality to users, most digital pets have certain level of autonomy and unpredictability. The user can interact with the pet and this process of personalizing can make the pet more distinctive. Personalizing increases the feeling of responsibility for the pet to the user.Fr√©d√©ric Kaplan Free creatures : The role of uselessness in the design of artificial pets, 2000 Frank, A.; Stern, A.; and Resner, B. 1997. Socially intelligent virtual petz. In Socially Intelligent Agents. For example, if a Tamagotchi is unattended for long enough, it will \\"die\\". =Interactivity= To increase user's personal attachment to the pet, the pet interacts with the user. Interactivity can be classified into two categories: Short-term and long-term. Short-term interactivity includes direct interaction or action to reaction from the pet. Example: \\"touch\\" a pet with mouse cursor and the pet will give a direct response to the \\"touching\\". Long-term interactivity includes action that affects the pet's growth, behavior or life span. For example, training a pet may have a good effect on the pet's behavior. Long-term interactivity is quite important for a sense of reality as the user would think that he has some lasting influence on the pet. Two kinds of interactivity are often combined. Training (long-term interaction) may happen through continuing short-term interaction. Similarly, playing with a pet (short-term interaction) may, if continued over the long term, make the pet more optimistic. =Example of common features= # Responds to calling # Responds to touching # Training the pet # Supplies or toys for the pet # Dressing up the pet # Competition or trial amongst pets # Meeting other pets # Complaining when it needs care See also *List of virtual pet games *AIBO References Life simulation games Electronic toys 1990s fads and trends Toy animals Video game genres ","title":"Digital pet"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",I]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/39.md","filePath":"sponsor/39.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/39.md"},F=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{W as __pageData,F as default};
