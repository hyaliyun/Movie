The BioGaia -B share is listed on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic Exchange. History BioGaia was founded in 1990. In laboratories all over the world, different strains of L. reuteri already existed. However, the research director of BioGaia Dr. Ivan Casas was looking for a strain for commercial use that could somehow bring proof to ‚Äúthe Circle of Life‚Äù that he believed in so strongly. He believed that there were more than one reason why newborn chickens were picking up and eating the faeces from their mothers and that this had to do with transfer of important microorganisms, from the mother to the sterile newborn bird. He was sure that the same situation was true for humans. It is generally accepted that newborn babies are sterile at birth and very sensitive to bad bacteria before they establish a microbial flora of their own. This flora should preferably come from their mother. Ivan was quite sure about that Lactobacillus reuteri was one of these bacteria that the mother should transfer to her offspring, whether a chicken, a human baby or any other mammal. Ivan analysed breast milk from many mothers in the USA where he lived and also from South American mothers in Lima, Peru, without finding any L. reuteri. However, he was still convinced that L. reuteri should be found in breast milk if Mother Nature was to decide. Ivan had family in Peru and whilst he was there for vacation, he took some days to travel to the Andes and visit several Indian villages. He then went to the university laboratory in Lima and presented some samples of breast milk. They all contained numerous strains of L. reuteri, which were subsequently isolated. One of these strains is still used in BioGaia‚Äôs probiotic products all over the world.

High reliability, long intervals between overhauls, and low life-cycle cost are its main advantages. The Geislinger coupling is an all-metal coupling for rotating shafts. It is elastic in torsion, allowing it to absorb torsional vibration. Unlike some other coupling types, it is not intended to compensate for high radial mis-alignment between shafts, but it can compensate axial misalignments better than elastomer couplings. The coupling may have a small ability to compensate for varying alignment, but if this is needed it is generally done through using an additional coupling in tandem. The coupling also runs at the same speed for input and output shafts, unlike a torque converter.  Development  The design was invented by Dr. Ing. Leonhard Geislinger in 1958. Its first use was for large diesel engines in locomotives, but it is also widely used in ships. Geislinger couplings are constructed inside robust enclosed steel housings. An outer housing and a central hub or \\"inner star\\" form the input and output drive members. Internally, the drive is transmitted through a number of radial leaf springs. The steel leaf springs are available in several configurations and the stiffness increases linear with displacement. These leaf springs are damped by a damping ring, the tips of the longest leaves engaging in splines in the inner star. Hydraulic damping is provided, as the leaf springs are immersed in oil. Any movement of the spring plates must squeeze oil through the narrow gaps around them between the plates and the casing. As the springs have a high surface area, yet there is only a small gap between them and their housing, the damping factor can be high. Damping can be adjusted completely independent from the coupling's torsional stiffness. The oil used for damping is usually supplied by the engine lubrication system, through a drilling in the crankshaft. If this is unavailable, an oil-filled coupling can be used. This oil filling also aids lubrication and encourages a long service life.  Uses  The coupling is mostly used on the output of large diesel engines. It isolates vibration between engines, shafts and driven components. A major benefit can be to avoid resonance problems where systems have a critical speed that must be avoided. Use of a damped coupling can shift this frequency to an unimportant speed, outside the engine operation speed range and damp resonance peak. The Geislinger coupling's ability to easily tailor its damping is valuable here to allow tuning for a particular frequency. The nearly linear torsional stiffness, makes it easy to calculate Torsional Vibrations.  Advantages  * High damping. The ratio between damping and elastic torques can be between 0.2 and 0.7, considerably higher than for an elastomeric coupling. * Wide range of stiffness variation. Stiffness and damping are adjustable independent to each other. These can also be adjusted by swapping spring packs, without needing to replace an entire coupling. * No aging. Unlike elastomer couplings, the materials do not change or wear out over time. Stiffness and damping remain constant in service. * High permissible torques (up to 6,500 kNm) and high resistance to vibratory torques * Unaffected by hot and oily environment * The coupling may continue in service, even with broken spring plates. * Compact design  Disadvantages  * The coupling is large and relatively complex. It is best suited to high-power applications. In small applications, a simpler elastomeric gear or spline coupling is adequate and sometimes cheaper.  Geislinger damper  The Geislinger Damper utilizes steel leaf springs and engine oil A related device is the Geislinger damper. This is broadly the same coupling, but both input and output shafts are connected to the same central hub. The massive outer casing is connected to this through similar leaf spring packs, but is free to move torsionally, with damping. It is used as a harmonic damper to control vibrations in shafts. The steel springs are tuned to optimize the natural frequency of a system and engine oil is used to reduce torsional vibrations. Geislinger uses specially developed software to select the specific damper parameters which best protect the engine crank- and camshaft, as well as intermediate and propeller shafts from damage due to critical vibratory loads. The Geislinger Damper provides constant stiffness and very high damping over the damper life, independent of engine room temperature.

The mother Ophelia (Cherry Pie Picache) loves to plant flowers especially roses. Her husband Miguel (Edu Manzano) is a well-respected man in their community. They use to celebrate Christmas with their children Dondi (Jason Salcedo), the eldest, Vincent (Justin Simoy) a paralytic, and their only daughter Maya (Korinne Lirio). But, when Ophelia gave birth to Christopher (Emman Abeleda) on Christmas Day, she got sick and series of events happened especially when Miguel's sisters Belle (Jaclyn Jose) and Christy (Rita Avila) came to the picture. Miguel suffered many problems in his business and was forced to go on hiding and Ophelia died and blamed Christopher. During Christmas season Belle and Christy along with their confidante Leopold (Manny Casta√±eda) are planning to sell the house and forcing the Carpio children as well as Tiyo Balti (Jaime Fabregas) and Lola Angeles (Anita Linda) to leave. However, Dondi and his siblings were moved to the garage. However, Tiyo Balti was there to help them and said the Christmas is the season of miracles, especially Dondi's girlfriend Sandy (Anna Larrucea). Their only way to save their house is the land title that was now yet found. They also saw a Christmas ball that come to life and introduced herself as Merry (Jolina Magdangal). Merry were given each of them one wishes except for Vincent who does not believe in the spirit of Christmas. However, they are barred from saying or sharing their wishes or it will come true. Maya was the first to make a wish, while they are in the Church, she wished for Vincent to walk again. Vincent fell and was able to walk again. For Christopher, he wished to have snow in Philippines. Although it's a tropical country, it began to snow. However, series of disasters happened because of snow. Especially Christopher who suffered pneumonia. When Christopher saw Belle and Christy making a fake title, he was also saw by Christy and hid himself buried in snow. Now, he is dying, Dondi wished to Merry for Christopher to be healed. He was completely healed that the doctor could not believed what caused his complete recovery. But, Vincent knew that it was Dondi who wished for him to walked again, until he knew that it was Maya. Because of the doctor's advice that Christopher might got sick again because of the snow, Sandy wished for the snow to stop. Belle and Christy goes for drastic measures to forced the children to get out. However, they were given until Christmas Day to go out. On Christmas Eve, they celebrated Christmas as well as Christopher's birthday and Merry bid farewell to them. As they celebrated Christmas, Belle and Christy came to tell them to get out. But, when Angeles came, Maya gave her a piece of white rose. When Angeles asked where she get the rose, they brought her to the garden and Angeles started to dig. The demolition team came but Dondi stopped them from destroying the house until Angeles found a chest and remembered everything. She recalled that their mother Ophelia put the land title, and they found the real land title.

This was due to a disagreement with the bishop of Vittorio Veneto, Albino Luciani, the future Pope John Paul I, over the appointment of the local priest.  Background  Montaner is a frazione in the municipality of Sarmede in the Province of Treviso, Italy. On December 13, 1966, Giuseppe Fa√®, the parish priest, died. Fa√®, who had served the community for forty years, had proven popular with the people of Montaner. He aided in the obtaining electricity and running water for the village, the construction of a new school, and even aided in the organization of anti-fascist resistance to the German Occupation. After his death, the bishop of Vittorio Veneto decided to appoint Giovanni Gava as the new priest, which was unpopular among the villagers. They instead supported Antonio Botteon, who, for a long time, had assisted the old priest. As a last resort, Botteon was asked to become the vice-rector of the parish. On January 21st, 1967, the new priest arrived in town, however, the night before his arrival, the townspeople erected a wall blocking the entrance of the church, and a mob of townspeople prevented him from carrying out his work. Luciani replied that for a village as small as Montaner, one priest was enough, while noting that priests are not elected by the people but appointed by their bishop. The bishop appointed a former Franciscan as a temporary rector, Father Casimiro from Monselice, again failing to meet the citizens' requests. Luciani's final decision was to appoint a new rector, Pietro Varnier. But on September 12, 1967, disgruntled citizens locked Varnier in the attic of the rectory. Luciani then arrived in Montaner, escorted by police, and removed the Blessed Sacrament from the Church, leaving the Church unblessed.  The schism  The Orthodox Church of Montaner The people then founded the Orthodox Church of Montaner. On December 26, 1967, the first Divine Liturgy was celebrated with the Orthodox Byzantine rite. The Orthodox priest, Claudio Vettorazzo, was permanently installed in June 1969 and on September 7, 1969, the Orthodox church was blessed. Residents of the village recall that the initial time period after the schism resulted in \\"hatred\\" and \\"confusion\\" within the village. In 1994, Vettorazzo was imprisoned because of legal and financial problems.Sexe et drogue dans la maison de l'√©v√™que Only after 1998 was the Orthodox Church of Montaner officially recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, to use the Byzantine Rite. In 2000, a nunnery associated with the church was founded. Today, the Catholic and Orthodox communities still exist within the village, though divisions remain. The Orthodox parish is also frequented by immigrants from Eastern Europe. See also *Schism *Old and New Light References Further reading * Valentina Ciciliot, Il caso Montaner.

After months of planning in 1856, Jumper's \\"Hatchet Gang\\" raided Rockport establishments that sold legal and illegal spirits. As a result of the raids, Rockport became a dry town until a voter referendum in 2005. Temperance Movement By the early 19th century, excessive drinking was considered to be a sufficient social problem that led to the founding of temperance societies in the United States and in Europe. The first founded in the U.S. was in 1808 in Saratoga, NY. By 1833, there were more than 6000 local societies in the country. At first the temperance groups' campaigns were directed only at distilled spirits, but after 1836 they were aimed at all alcoholic beverages. Background Hannah Jumper was born in 1781, the sixth of eight children to William and Susan (Parsons) Jumper. According to Eleanor C. Parsons, author of Hannah and the Hatchet Gang; Rockport's Revolt Against Rum, it is reasonable to assume that William, returning home from an American Revolutionary War battle, might have named his new daughter after the USS Hannah, the first armed vessel to fly the flag of the United States colonies.Eleanor C. Parsons, Hannah and the Hatchet Gang; Rockport's Revolt against Rum (Canaan, NH: Phoenix Publishing, 1975), 14. Early years Though born to a family of seafaring men, Hannah grew up in Joppa, the only farming community between Gloucester and Sandy Bay (later to become Rockport) harbors. Through her adolescent years, she grew tall and rawboned, and it was during her teens, when Hannah learned how to carry on all the household tasks of her large and impoverished family. It was also during this period that Hannah would learn to take care of the sick as well. Adult Years Hannah became versed at growing, drying, and steeping herbs as potent cures for all kinds of ailments during this period. When she reached thirty her favorite sister, Suzanna, died from consumption, her mother two years later from the same disease. Consumption was one of the most common diseases of the 18th and 19th centuries. It would later become known as tuberculosis. No one during Hannah's time knew how to cure it, so liquor became a medicine. It was because of these constant hardships in taking care of family members, \\"Hannah found meaning in her life by going wherever she was needed, by doing for others whenever she could.\\"Parsons, 17. When she was no longer required on the farm in Joppa, Hannah moved to Rockport. It was there that she would earn her living administering to the sick with her homemade remedies and by laundering and mending clothing for the townspeople. Planting the Seeds of Rebellion From its earliest days of settlement, there had been efforts to control excessive drinking. Vendors of spirits were legally bound to present good-conduct certificates in order to secure licenses. On March 11, 1847, townspeople formed an abstinence membership such as the \\"Bay Tent of Rechabites.\\"Marshall W. S. Swan, Town on Sandy Bay, a History of Rockport, MA (Canaan, NH: Phoenix Publishing, 1980), 154. This local organization would incorporate over one hundred abstainers. As a result of its remote geographic location residents of Rockport, especially women, were lacking economically and intellectually. All but illiterate, Hannah and the other villagers were informed of news events, twice a week with the arrival of The Gloucester Telegraph, a newspaper that was delivered by stagecoach to Rockport. Editorials that were in discussion during this time period were of slavery in the United States and the shameful extravagances of the people of New York City and of Paris, France. The women of Rockport, and notably Hannah, became increasingly agitated of the lavish spending of what was vogue in Paris and the disgraceful overindulgence exemplified by American women of wealth. The ladies were offended by the newspaper's advertisements which flaunted such luxuries. But the most shameful, outrageous expense of all to Hannah and her gang, according to the author Parsons, was the more than four and half million dollars the country frittered away on wines and liquors. The men of Rockport were spending large portions of their earnings on rum. They said rum was as much a part of fishing as bait. Still, the $157 each fisherman brought home at the end of nine months of fishing was not enough to feed a family. In an era when a pound of flour cost $10, the men were spending 1 3/8 cents for a drink of rum. Parson's adds, that all this profligate spending could not help but fan the women's content.\\"Parsons, 19. Between the time of the forming of the \\"Bay Tent of Rechabites\\"History of the town of Rockport: as comprised in the centennial address of Lemuel Gott, M.D., extracts from the memoranda of Ebenezer Pool, Esq., and interesting items from other sources (Google eBook) and the 1856 town meeting appointed \\"Smellin' Committee,\\" liquor continued to flow unchecked. The Smellin' Committee of four agents was empowered to enforce the statutes set by the town fathers, but it went down to defeat by open defiance. Author Marshall W.C. Swan writes, \\"that it was estimated that the sale of spirits (legal and illegal) had climbed 250 percent in the previous four years. The time for talk had ended.\\"Swan, 154. In the summer of 1856, after weeks, perhaps months, of recruiting and planning, the women had maintained their secret well. Town officials, unaware of the impending event, were making plans for the town's third Independence Day celebration. Parsons writes, \\"the festivities got underway the night before the Fourth, and not unexpectedly resulted in a drunken fracas which spilled over into the next week. However, the committee of four agents and the two town constables stood by clumsy and inefficient, making only token efforts to seek out the guilty offenders. This episode became the last straw. The women were organized and ready.\\"Parsons, 23. The Assault by Hannah and the Hatchet Gang On the morning of July 8, 1856, a 75-year-old spinster, Hannah Jumper, awakes as custom to the sun rising over Sandy Bay harbor. The plan for the raid had been finalized the night before. The group which had surveyed where most of the liquor activities were taking place, had secretly marked small crosses in white chalk in front of the offending establishments. They also reminded each other, \\"Don't forget the shawls.\\" It is before 9am when Hannah, along with other leaders of the movement, leave their dwellings to head to the center of town, Dock Square. The gathering mob begins to sweep in some non-members to their cause and the author Parsons reports that there could be heard an occasional outcry of \\"get a hammer,\\" \\"get a tomahawk,\\" \\"get a hatchet.\\"Parsons, 26. One member of the predominantly female crew carries a hand-made banner of rectangular shape and of unbleached cotton. Crimson tassels adorn it and a hatchet is painted in black from corner to corner. (Parsons notes that after the raid the banner was somehow lost, and found again, sold for $5 to the Gloucester Historical Society, later returned for $5 to the Rockport Public Library who then gave it to the Sandy Bay Historical Society where it now resides.) The group swells to over 200 townspeople as they begin going through the town and destroying its liquor supplies. From under their shawls on that hot summer's day, \\"Hannah and her Hatchet Gang\\" unleashed their weapons raiding each of the marked locations where liquor was being, or had been, sold legally and illegally. According to Herbert A. Kenny's Cape Ann: Cape America, \\"If shops or homes were closed, the gang forced themselves in. They seized casks, demijohns, jugs and bottles that contained the bane of their happiness and emptied their contents into the street ‚Äì occasionally making use of their hatchets (with which they were liberally supplied) to hasten the flow of the hated liquid.\\"Herbert A. Kenny, Cape Ann: Cape America (Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott, 1971), 92. Parsons scribes, \\"the ludicrous spectacle ends at two o'clock in the afternoon. Seven hundred to a thousand persons thronged Dock Square, sniffing at two to three hundred gallons of spilled liquor. Some men shuffled about as they had earlier in the day, wondering what to expect next, some scarcely believing in what they had witnessed. Some were downright indignant at their wives but others openly admired their show of courage.\\"Parsons, 40. In all, \\"Hannah and the gang\\" raided thirteen establishments during their five-hour assault, leaving hatchet marks on fifty barrels and destroying $700 worth of liquor. It was reported the men described Rockport as a mammoth punch bowl, with which the smell of rum drifted for two miles across the bay. The Trial Jim Brown was the owner of a small grocery store, and according to some townspeople was a man with one of the most questionable reputations of all in Rockport. Brown became the angriest man in town. After seeing his store entered and its liquor contents destroyed, he brought up charges in an Essex County court, of breaking and entering and the destruction of property against the entire gang of hatchet-wielding women. The verdict, in favor of the women, was appealed time and time again. In the end, the original verdict was upheld and Brown was ordered to pay the court costs of $346.25 to the defendants. Hannah Jumper's Legacy Until 1966, Rockport residents voted on the issue of the sale of liquor in every general election. In that year, the state laws regarding the sale of liquor were amended. The new law stated that if the liquor issue were voted on in the affirmative or the negative in three consecutive elections, then the issue would be dropped from the ballot. In 1966, 1968 and 1970, Rockport residents voted against the sale of liquor in their community. A petition with 10 percent of registered voters is required before a referendum can be placed on the ballot. Such a referendum was held in 1998, and was defeated. In 2005 it was approved, as restaurants can serve and sell alcohol to customers who are having a meal.Welcome to Rockport. seecapeann.com. Retrieved 11/21/11. In 2011, modifications to the existing town regulations were instituted as the definition of a meal: \\"The term meal shall include hors d'oeuvres, appetizers, desserts, sandwiches, soups, salads, entrees and prepared foods but shall exclude chips, nuts, pretzels, popcorn and other snack food...\\" And that beverages can also be served while waiting to be seated: \\"Alcoholic beverages may be served in a designated area for those waiting to be seated for dining if a reservation has been made with restaurant personnel.\\"Dyke Hendrikson, \\"Rockport Eases its Rules on Alcohol\\", The Gloucester Daily Times, June 15, 2011.

She published poetry, a Christmas hymn, a novel, and an autobiography entitled Roses and Thorns, or Recollections of an Artist. As a young girl, she was an excellent student, but needed to quit school at the age of 11 to care for her ill grandmother. At 15, she taught school and a year later joined an academy in Providence, Rhode Island, where she earned her way through school by making and selling needlework. She graduated with highest honors and established a school that she operated for years. Paine gave the profits to her family, and she helped support them throughout most of her life. She had a short marriage characterized by abuse and control. A child was born to the couple, but died 11 months later. Before the child's birth, Paine had left her husband and obtained a divorce. To support herself, she taught school for a period and then began to work as a portraitist. She traveled throughout Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine accepting commissions for portraits of individuals or families from 1826 through 1862. Because she lived a mobile lifestyle, she had few long-lasting relationships. The closest personal relationship of her life was with her mother. She raised a girl, however, for three years and taught her how to paint. Once she became a professional portraitist she had periods of financial security, but that and her physical health vacillated over the course of her career. Early life Susanna Paine, born in Rehoboth, Massachusetts on June 9, 1792, was the second child of James Paine (b. 1764‚Äì65) and Mary Chaffee Paine (1767‚Äì1849). Her father was a mariner. When she was a young girl, he was lost at sea. She then lived with her maternal grandparents, Reverend Jonathan Chaffee and Mary Chaffee. Paine, an excellent student, attended school until she was 11 years of age, when she was needed to help care for her ill grandmother. The following year she nearly died as the result of a lightning strike that killed the person standing beside her. Believed to have died, she resumed consciousness after one hour, but suffered from seizures for several years after the incident. Her mother married widower Nathaniel Thurber on April 9, 1808, and the combined household, including his four children, moved to a Foster, Rhode Island farm. At 15 years of age, Paine taught school and then attended \\"the best Academy in Rhode Island\\", which she financed through the sales of her needlework. Paine learned how to paint with watercolor at the academy and graduated with the highest honors; she was sufficiently trained \\"to teach any of the common branches of education.\\" Upon graduation Paine established a school near her mother and stepfather's house. The profits she made from the school were given to her mother and on one occasion loaned to her stepfather. Reluctantly, and at her mother's insistence, she married James Phillips on November 4, 1819. Her husband‚Äîa gambler‚Äîwas abusive, tyrannical and cruel. According to Paine, she left her husband after \\"one year and two months of cruel bondage\\". Paine returned to her mother's house and three months later gave birth to her son on August 30, 1821. The child, Theodore Winthrop Phillips, died 11 months later. The Rhode Island Supreme Court granted Paine a divorce from her husband in 1821 or 1823. Paine was left destitute, having received no alimony and having relinquished property that she previously owned to her husband. Paine resumed teaching and painted portraits to supplement her earnings, allowing her to support herself and send money to her mother, stepfather and their family, who had moved to Connecticut. To this point her life had been one of turmoil and financial precariousness. Rather than marry another man to secure a better standard of living, she developed a career so that she could support herself. Artist George Morillo Bartol, pastel on paper, 1827, private collectionSusanna Paine, Eliza and Sheldon Battey and their son Thomas Sheldon Battey Providence, Rhode Island, oil on wood, 1830, private collectionPortrait ad by Susanna Paine, Portland, December 12, 1826Portrait of a Lady'Catherine R. Williams, , oil on wood, Rhode Island Historical Society Paine worked as a professional portrait painter by traveling through New England and placing advertisements in local newspapers to solicit business. She and Ruth Henshaw Bascom were two of 11 or more women who worked as professional itinerant portraitists in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Paine was \\"a woman of stalwart proportions, weighing over 200 pounds, and was a very original character...\\" She was also described as an idealist. Paine was subject to criticism for traveling alone as a woman, but found it was safe to stay in boarding houses, secured through \\"several letters of introduction\\" from trusted people. To establish herself as a \\"genteel\\" artist, she studied art at the Boston Athen√¶um, stayed at upscale boarding houses, and became a published writer. Throughout her career, Paine generally made oil paintings on 1/2 inch wood panels of which the sides and back were washed in red, gray-green, or green-blue. The subjects of the paintings were often portrayed in a confident manner in half-length poses. Their accessories, hair, and clothing were often \\"elaborately detailed\\". The placement of hands, tables, and other objects could be awkward. She had a tendency to paint the sitters with long hands, light flesh tones, doelike eyes and round faces. Paine was known to take liberties in the portrayal of her subjects; she once painted a gray-eyed man's portrait with black eyes because she thought they were more attractive. Maine She traveled alone for the first time in 1826 to Portland, Maine and placed a business advertisement in the December 12 edition of the Portland Advertiser. The standard rate for large oil portraits at that time was US$20‚Äì$30, but Paine advertised $8 for large portraits. Not having received any leads for work, she placed a January ad with a testimonial, which said that her portrait's were a good likeness of the subject and well executed‚Äîand that women might find \\"a pride and pleasure in patronizing a female artist.\\" Once she made a painting for her landlady and neighbors saw it, she began to receive commissions for her work. Paine worked in southern Maine, Portland, and New Hampshire in 1827 and 1828. Initially, she had sufficient commissions to support the rental of a furnished parlor, an office for painting, and another office to exhibit her portraits. A religious woman, Paine adopted simpler clothing as a spiritual practice during this time. As her health declined, she engaged nursing services, which left her short of funds. Paine answered a friend's request to return to Providence to paint her dying daughter, and still in poor health, stayed there several months. Paine worked as an artist in Maine until about 1831. One of her subjects while in Portland was George Morillo Bartol, her portrait of him sold for US$38,513 on March 6, 2011. Massachusetts She received formal art training at the Boston Athen√¶um around 1832 and spent the following summer in Cape Ann. Paine, one of the first artists to paint on Cape Ann, returned for several years, interrupted by visits to her mother each spring and fall. She was in the village of Annisquam on Cape Ann by 1834, when she painted portraits of families. Paine continued to paint on the cape during the 1830s and 1840s. She found it to be a unique place: She raised a girl, who she called her adopted daughter, from 12 to 15 years of age. During that time Paine taught her to paint and they lived for a few months in Fall River, Massachusetts. During a visit to her mother and stepfather's farm, she found that her younger half-brother, Nathaniel, had secured the deed to the farm and lived in the main house; her parents lived in \\"a sort of out-house\\". Months later, after her half-brother sold the farm, Paine found them \\"looking sad and dejected\\" with Nathaniel in South Killingly, Connecticut and made arrangements for her mother and step-father to live in an apartment. Rhode Island In 1830, Paine painted the portrait of author, Catharine R. Williams, who wrote poetry, Religion at Home, and the Lives of William Barton and Stephen Olney. The portrait was given to the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1885 from a group of members of the society, including Henry J. Steere. From about 1836, she had a residence in Providence, Rhode Island and kept her parents in \\"comfortable support\\". Between 1836 and 1838, she wrote and published a Christmas hymn and poetry. She enjoyed a successful professional life until 1842 when she left town for her safety during the Dorr Rebellion. She went to Cape Ann and after a few months returned to Providence. She became ill and, unable to find work in both places, suffered financially. Her mother came to live with her in Providence following the death of her stepfather, Nathaniel Thurber, in November, 1848. The following March, her mother Mary died during a visit to her half-brother who then lived in Hartford, Connecticut. She had supported her parents since she was a teenaged girl. Later years Paine traveled through Maine, where she had difficulty establishing herself for want of connections that she had relied upon in the past, so she returned to Providence and for the first time established herself in a highly respectable commercial building with, aside from herself, only male occupants. She struggled professionally and, because of the loss of her mother, she suffered personally. The career that she relied upon kept her forever traveling, which had made it difficult to establish long-standing relationships. Her relationship with her mother was the only close one of her life. She published her autobiography, Roses and Thorns, or Recollections of an Artist in 1854. Google books Six years later she published Wait and See, a Victorian novel. She died in Providence, Rhode Island on November 10, 1862.

A diplomat for the government of the United Kingdom, Coltman had been appointed to the position of British ambassador to Cuba from 1991 through to 1994, during which time he got to know Castro personally. He died shortly before his biography's publication. The biography looks at Castro's life from its beginning up until the start of the 21st century, when Castro was in his final years of the presidency, a position that he would relinquish in 2008. The book is accompanied by anecdotes about Castro and his relationship with other politicians, supplied by Coltman from his years in the diplomatic service. The Real Fidel Castro was reviewed in the mainstream press in both the United Kingdom and United States. Background Synopsis Reception U.K. press reviews In a review published in the British magazine New Statesman, the journalist and historian Richard Gott noted that Coltman \\"has a good eye for detail and the telling anecdote\\" but at the same time, Gott felt that he \\"devotes rather too much space to Castro's early life, galloping though the 1990s about which his personal experience and insights might have been better deployed at greater length.\\" Believing that the \\"stock-in-trade\\" of diplomats like Coltman was gossip, Gott felt that Coltman's work \\"repeats more stories about the love-lives of senior revolutionaries than I found interesting\\". Gott went on to compare Coltman's biography with one published around the same time, written by the German reporter Volker Skierka; he notes that \\"For the first time, we now have two full-length studies of the Cuban leader that reflect a European view. It makes a salutary change, and both diplomat and reporter have original things to say.

In October 2016, the Pegasus II was replaced by multiple Pegasus XL mounted underneath the carrier aircraft, developments of the original Pegasus rocket which had been launched 42 times since 1990.  Testing  By May 1, 2017, Stratolaunch had already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the project. On May 31, 2017, the aircraft was rolled out for fueling tests, and to be prepared for ground testing, engine runs, taxi tests, and ultimately first flight. The company stated that it was aiming for a 2019 first-launch demonstration. The Register newspaper in 2017 reported that Stratolaunch may have competition from the DARPA XS-1 or from Vector Space Systems by 2019. By September 2017, engine testing was underway as well as testing of \\"control surfaces and electric, pneumatic and fire detection systems.\\" In December 2017, its first low-speed taxi test took it to on the runway powered by its six turbofans to test its steering, braking, and telemetry. Higher-speed taxi tests began in 2018, reaching in February, and () in October. On January 9, 2019, Stratolaunch completed a 110 knot () taxi test, and released a photograph of the nose landing gear lifted off the ground during the test. In January 2019, three months after the death of Stratolaunch founder and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Stratolaunch abandoned the development of its PGA rocket engines and dedicated launchers. This left the Northrop Grumman Pegasus XL as the sole launch option for an orbital capability of . Stratolaunch was then reported to be aiming for a first flight within a few weeks and a first launch from the carrier in 2020. The aircraft first flew on April 13, 2019, at the Mojave Air and Space Port, reaching and 165 kn (305 km/h) in a 2 h 29 min flight. Development halt and sale  The future of Stratolaunch had been in doubt since the death of company founder Paul Allen in October 2018, with speculation that Stratolaunch Systems could cease operations. Allen had been the source of funds for the capital intensive development program since the project began in 2010, and the company founding in 2011. In January 2019, Stratolaunch announced it was halting development of its air-launched family of launch vehicles. On 31 May 2019, the company announced that it would cease operations and that sale of its assets was being explored. An asking price of was reported, which would include the sole aircraft, the company facilities, equipment, the designs and other intellectual property. In June 2019 the Stratolaunch Systems company and assets were put up for sale by Vulcan for $400 million. By 11 October, Stratolaunch said it has a new ownership and will continue regular operations, but did not disclose who the group of investors is. In December, the new owner was revealed to be Cerberus Capital Management, a specialist in the acquisition of distressed companies.[Exclusive: Buyer of Paul Allen‚Äôs Stratolaunch space venture is secretive Trump ally], Geekwire, 11 December 2019, accessed 12 December 2019. After the acquisition, Stratolaunch is now focusing on offering high-speed flight test services. Post-ownership change By early 2020, Stratolaunch was developing the Talon-A reusable, rocket-powered, hypersonic flight vehicle (the Vulcan Aerospace Hyper-A concept in 2018). It could be carried by the airplane from 2022, up to three at once from 2023, and a larger concept vehicle, the Talon-Z, could carry cargo or people to orbit.  Design  Stratolaunch has a twin-fuselage configuration, each long and supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels, for a total of 28 wheels. The twin-fuselage configuration is similar to the Scaled Composites White Knight Two. Each fuselage has its own empennage. The pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer are accommodated in the right fuselage cockpit, while the left fuselage cockpit is empty and unpressurized. The flight data systems are in the left fuselage. At , it is the largest plane by wingspan, greater than a American football field. The center section of the high-mounted, high aspect ratio wing is fitted with a Mating and Integration System (MIS), developed by Dynetics and capable of handling a load. Stratolaunch is powered by six Pratt & Whitney PW4056 engines positioned on pylons outboard of each fuselage, providing of thrust per engine. Many of the aircraft systems have been adopted from the Boeing 747-400, including the engines, avionics, flight deck, landing gear and other systems, reducing development costs. It will require of runway to lift-off. It should release its rocket at . It will carry a payload. With a Pegasus II, it could deliver up to satellites to LEO or to a 15¬∞ GTO. It could launch a Dream Chaser small spaceplane capable of transporting astronauts or payloads within 24 hours. The stated goal is to carry up to three Orbital ATK \\"Pegasus XL\\" rockets for high-altitude launches by 2022. Within Scaled Composites, its model number is M351. It is nicknamed \\"Roc\\" after Sinbad's Roc, the mythical bird so big it could carry an elephant.

For example, the statement \\"Paul saw a snake\\" asserts the truthfulness of the claim, while \\"Paul did see a snake\\" is an even stronger assertion. Negation is veridical, though of opposite polarity, sometimes called antiveridical: \\"Paul didn't see a snake\\" asserts that the statement \\"Paul saw a snake\\" is false. In English, non-indicative moods are frequently used in a nonveridical sense: \\"Paul may have seen a snake\\" and \\"Paul would have seen a snake\\" do not assert that Paul actually saw a snake (and the second implies that he did not), though \\"Paul would indeed have seen a snake\\" is veridical, and some languages have separate veridical conditional moods for such cases. Nonveridicality has been proposed to be behind the licensing of polarity items such as the English words any and ever, as an alternative to the influential downward entailment theory proposed by Ladusaw (1980). Anastasia Giannakidou (1998) argues that various polarity phenomena observed in language are manifestations of the dependency of polarity items to the (non)veridicality of the context of appearance. The (non)veridical dependency may be positive (licensing), or negative (anti-licensing), and arises from the sensitivity semantics of polarity items. Across languages, different polarity items may show sensitivity to veridicality, anti- veridicality, or non-veridicality.  Definition  The formal definition of veridicality views the context as a propositional operator (Giannakidou 1998). # A propositional operator F is veridical iff Fp entails p: Fp ‚Üí p; otherwise F is nonveridical. # Additionally, a nonveridical operator F is antiveridical iff Fp entails not p: Fp ‚Üí ¬¨p. For temporal and aspectual operators, the definition of veridicality is somewhat more complex: * For operators relative to instants of time: Let F be a temporal or aspectual operator, and t an instant of time. *# F is veridical iff for Fp to be true at time t, p must be true at a (contextually relevant) time t‚Ä≤ ‚â§ t; otherwise F is nonveridical. *# A nonveridical operator F is antiveridical iff for Fp to be true at time t, ¬¨p must be true at a (contextually relevant) time t‚Ä≤ ‚â§ t. * For operators relative to intervals of time: Let F be a temporal or aspectual operator, and t an interval of time. *# F is veridical iff for Fp to be true of t, p must be true of all (contextually relevant) t‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ t; otherwise F is nonveridical. *# A nonveridical operator F is antiveridical iff for Fp to be true of t, ¬¨p must be true of all (contextually relevant) t‚Ä≤ ‚äÜ t.  Nonveridical operators  Nonveridical operators typically license the use of polarity items, which in veridical contexts normally is ungrammatical: : * Mary saw any students. (The context is veridical.) : Mary didn't see any students. (The context is nonveridical.)  Downward entailment  All downward entailing contexts are nonveridical. Because of this, theories based on nonveridicality can be seen as extending those based on downward entailment, allowing more cases of polarity items licensing to be explained. Downward entailment predicts that polarity items will be licensed in the scope of negation, downward entailing quantifiers like few N, at most n N, no N, and the restriction of every: : No students saw anything. : Mary didn't see anything. : Few children saw anything. : Every student who saw anything should report to the police.  Non-monotone quantifiers  Quantifiers like exactly three students, nobody but John, and almost nobody are non-monotone (and thus not downward entailing) but nevertheless admit any: : % Exactly three students saw anything. : Nobody but Mary saw anything. : Almost nobody saw anything.  Hardly and barely  Hardly and barely allow for any despite not being downward entailing. : Mary hardly talked to anybody. (Does not entail \\"Mary hardly talked to her mother\\".) : Mary barely studied anything. (Does not entail \\"Mary barely studied linguistics\\".)  Questions  Polarity items are quite frequent in questions, although questions are not monotone. : Did you see anything? Although questions biased towards the negative answer, such as \\"Do you [even] give a damn about any books?\\" (tag questions based on negative sentences exhibit even more such bias), can sometimes be seen as downward entailing, this approach cannot account for the general case, such as the above example where the context is perfectly neutral. Neither can it explain why negative questions, which naturally tend to be biased, don't license negative polarity items. In semantics which treats a question as the set of its true answers, the denotation of a polar question contains two possible answers: : Did you see Mary? = { you saw Mary ‚à® you didn't see Mary } Because disjunction p ‚à® q entails neither p nor q, the context is nonveridical, which explains the admittance of any.  Future  Polarity items appear in future sentences. : Mary will buy any bottle of wine. : The children will leave as soon as they discover anything. According to the formal definition of veridicality for temporal operators, future is nonveridical: that \\"John will buy a bottle of Merlot\\" is true now does not entail that \\"John buys a bottle of Merlot\\" is true at any instant up to and including now. On the other hand, past is veridical: that \\"John bought a bottle of Merlot\\" is true now entails that there is an instant preceding now at which \\"John buys a bottle of Merlot\\" is true.  Habitual aspect  Likewise, nonveridicality of the habitual aspect licenses polarity items. : He usually reads any book very carefully. The habitual aspect is nonveridical because e.g., that \\"He is usually cheerful\\" is true over some interval of time does not entail that \\"He is cheerful\\" is true over every subinterval of that. This is in contrast to e.g., the progressive aspect, which is veridical and prohibits negative polarity items.  Generic sentences  Non-monotone generic sentences accept polarity items. : Any cat hunts mice.  Modal verbs  Modal verbs create generally good environments for polarity items: : Mary may talk to anybody. : Any minors must be accompanied by their parents. : The committee can give the job to any candidate. Such contexts are nonveridical despite being non-monotone and sometimes even upward entailing (\\"Mary must tango\\" entails \\"Mary must dance\\").  Imperatives  Imperatives are roughly parallel to modal verbs and intensional contexts in general. : Take any apple. (cf. \\"You may/must take any apple\\", \\"I want you to take any apple\\".)  Protasis of conditionals  Protasis of conditionals is one of the most common environments for polarity items. : If you sleep with anybody, I'll kill you.  Directive intensional verbs  Polarity items are licensed with directive propositional attitudes but not with epistemic ones. : Mary would like to invite any student. : Mary asked us to invite any student. : * Mary believes that we invited any student. : * Mary dreamt that we invited any student.

Background The 1924 campaign came within the scope of the historic conflict between the Hashemites of Hejaz and the Saudis of Riyadh (Nejd), which had already sparked the First Saudi-Hashemite War in 1919. Saudi campaign The pretext for renewed hostilities between Nejd and Hejaz came when the pilgrims from Nejd were denied access to the holy places in Hejaz.Dr. Fattouh Al-Khatrash. The Hijaz- Najd War (1924 ‚Äì 1925) On August 29, 1924, Ibn-Saud began his military campaign against Hejaz by advancing towards Taif, which surrendered without a major struggle. Following the fall of Taif, the Saudi forces and the allied Ikhwan tribesmen moved on Mecca. Sharif Hussein‚Äôs request for British assistance was denied to him on the pretext of non-intervention in religious disputes. King Hussein bin Ali had meanwhile fled from Mecca to Jeddah, after the assistance request from his son, King Abdullah of Transjordan was denied as well. The city of Mecca fell without struggle on October 13, 1924. The Islamic Conference, held in Riyadh on the 29th October 1924, brought a wide Islamic recognition of Ibn-Saud‚Äôs jurisdiction over Mecca. With the advancement of the Saudi forces and blockade imposed on Jeddah, the Hejazi army began to disintegrate. The city of Medina surrendered on December 9, 1925, and Yanbu fell 12 days later. Jeddah was handed to Sultan Abdulaziz of Nejd and Saudi forces on December 1925, with the Saudi forces entering its gates on January 8, 1926, after capitulation and safe passage was negotiated between King bin Ali, Sultan Abdulaziz, and the British Consul by the city's ruler Sheikh Abdullah Alireza. Aftermath Following the successful takeover over the Kingdom of Hejaz, Abdulaziz Ibn Saud was declared as King of Hejaz. The Kingdom was later incorporated into the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz, with Ibn Saud being the king of both in political union. King Hussein of Hejaz fled to Cyprus, declaring his son Ali bin Hussein as the King of Hejaz, but effectively with the fall of the Kingdom the dynasty ended up in exile. Hashemites however remained to rule the Emirate of Transjordan and the Kingdom of Iraq.

Cause lawyering is commonly described as a practice of \\"lawyering for the good\\" or using law to empower members of the weaker layers of society. It may or may not be performed pro bono. Cause lawyering is frequently practiced by individual lawyers or lawyers employed by associations that aim to supply a public service to complement state-provided legal aid. Cause lawyering is performed by a lawyer or a firm that is \\"most frequently directed at altering some aspect of the social, economic, and political status quo.\\"Douglas NeJaime, Cause Lawyers Inside the State, 81 Fordham L. Rev. 649, 656 (2012). The content of the issue is not particularly relevant, only the advocacy of an issue and the attempt to bring about social change through legal or even quasi-legal avenues.NeJaime, 81 Fordham L. Rev. 649, 656 (2012). Cause lawyering can include dedicated advocacy by public interest firms, pro bono work by attorneys in private practice and other non-traditional forms of law practice that advocates a cause.Laura Beth Nielsen & Catherine R. Albiston, The Organization of Public Interest Practice: 1975-2004, 84 N.C. L. Rev. 1591, 1603 (2006). Lawyers who work for the government, whether federal, state, or local, can also be cause lawyers; although the majority of cause lawyering tends to be adversarial towards the state.NeJaime at 654.  Definition  As coined by experts Stuart Scheingold and Austin Sarat in their work Something to Believe In: Politics, Professionalism, and Cause Lawyering,Stuart A. Scheingold and Austin Sarat Something to Believe In: Politics, Professionalism, and Cause Lawyering Stanford Law and Politics (2004). cause lawyering consists of \\"using legal skills to pursue ends and ideals that transcend client service ‚Äì be those ideals social, cultural, political, economic or indeed, legal\\".Austin Sarat and Stuart Scheingold, Cause Lawyering: Political Commitments and Professional Responsibilities. New York: Oxford University Press (1998). There is no single \\"correct\\" way to define what Cause Lawyering is or who is a cause lawyer.Anna-Maria Marshall, Daniel Crocker Hale, Cause Lawyering, 10 Ann. Rev. L. & Soc. Sci. 301, 302 (2014). Cause lawyering is particularly hard to put limits around because it encompasses so much in the legal world and almost any issue can be considered an issue or cause that is being advocated for, and thereby qualifying as cause lawyering. Cause lawyering does not require a particular political side, but does require a \\"determination to take sides in political and moral struggle without making distinctions between worthy and unworthy causes\\".Scheingold and Sarat at 5. Cause lawyering is less about the client and more about the issue the client represents. Cause lawyering is about the belief in a cause or issue and the will/desire to advance that cause.Thomas M. Hilbink, You Know the Type...: Categories of Cause Lawyering, 29 Law & Soc. Inquiry 657, 659 (2004). Cause lawyers tend to choose clients on the basis of their own ideological grounds, no matter where they fall on the political, social, economic, and /or legal spectrum.Id. What ultimately separates the cause lawyer from other types of lawyers is the advancement of the cause through the client to transform the status quo in service to a cause that is just as important, or more important, than the client. In a 2004 American Bar Foundation essay, Thomas M. Hilbink outlined the \\"typolog[ies]\\" of cause lawyering. In this essay, cause lawyers are broken into three typologies: (1) Proceduralist Lawyering; (2) Elite-Vanguard Lawyering; and (3) Grassroots Lawyering. Proceduralist lawyering is \\"marked by a belief in the separation of law and politics, and a belief that the legal system is essentially fair and just\\".Id. at 668 Elite-Vanguard lawyering focuses on law as a superior form of politics that uses the law to render substantive justice in a way that will change substantive law and thereby change society.Id. at 673 Grassroots lawyering, however, approaches law as \\"just\\" another form of politics, a venue that is corrupt, unjust, or unfair, and aims to achieve substantive social justice through using the law in combination of other social movements, but refraining from using the law as a primary method for social change.Id. at 681  History  What is now known as cause lawyering grew when the idea of \\"legal science\\", a 19th-century belief of legal objectivity in which law could be determined through the application of scientific principles and methodologies, was challenged.Thomas Hilbink, Constructing Cause Lawyering: Professionalism, Politics, and Social Change in 1960's America, New York University (2006). Until the late 19th century, the legal field worked to separate law and politics, precluding the idea that the law could be used as a force for political or social change. The first organizations to break into cause lawyering and tear down the idea came into existence in the 20th century, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Through intermixing political progressivism and the law, these two organizations paved the way for politically themed legal entities to use the law in a way that would advance the cause they represented. In applying the broad encompassing cause lawyering definition from above, cause lawyering has existed as long as legal advocacy has existed. As long as an advocate has advocated for a client and against a perceived social or legal wrong, although the term was not coined until 1998, cause lawyering has been active. In the late 1800s it was slavery and state's rights, in the early 1900s it was women's suffrage and civil rights. In the 1960s and the non-profit law firm was born.Louise G. Trubek, Public Interest Law: Facing the Problems of Maturity, 33 U. Ark. Little Rock L. Rev. 417, 418 (2011). The creation of non-profit law firms ushered in an era of progressive public interest firms modeled after already established like the NAACP and the ACLU to advance progressive causes from the environmental protection to consumer advocacy. These beginning organizations of cause lawyering, and the ones that followed scored major legal victories that have lasting effects to this day; see Brown v. Board of Education In the 1960s, the Ford Foundation began funding legal services programs as a component of anti- poverty programs helping fund some of the forerunners of legal services for indigent clients: Mobilization for Youth in New York, Action for Boston Community Development, the Legal Assistance Association in New Haven, and the United Planning Organization in Washington.National Legal Aid and Defender Association, History of Civil Legal Aid, http://www.nlada.org/About/About_HistoryCivil (2011), (Accessed April 4, 2016). While not identified as cause lawyers at the time, these early programs explicitly fit the mold of using the legal system to advance their cause. Once the newly minted non-profit law firms were established as charitable organizations eligible for IRS tax-deduction, they began to advocate on behalf of disadvantaged and underrepresented groups, advancing the civil rights and poverty legal work from decades earlier.Trubek at 418. During the 1970s, feminist law firms began to emerge with the growing Women's Movement and with each newly emerging social movement, new cause lawyering organizations sprung up to complement them.Hilbink at 384. By the mid to late 1970s the explosion of progressive cause lawyering organization was being followed by the creation of more conservative cause lawyering firms.Id. at 385. The face of cause lawyering has ebbed and flowed just as political movements, social movements, and economic movements have from the 1970s through today. Major events, like the establishment of the Legal Services Corporation and subsequent restriction; decisions in Loving v. Virginia, Lawrence v. Texas, Roe v. Wade, District of Columbia v. Heller, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Shelby County v. Holder, United States v. Windsor, and Obergfel v. Hodges; along with everyday victories and defeats of cause lawyers all over the United States have shaped our last one hundred years and will continue to shape the legal landscape to come. As Dean F. Michael Higginbotham said in his Keynote Speech at the University of La Verne Law Review Symposium in 2014: \\"Make no mistake ... there is no better feeling in this life than to know that you have helped to improve the lives of those around you. Nice to make some money, nice to have material things, but there is nothing better than knowing that you have helped the impoverished, that you have helped the hungry, that you have helped the politically powerless, and that you have helped the undereducated to gain at least a semblance of dignity.\\"Dean F. Michael Higginbotham, Keynote Speech: A Letter from the Original Cause Lawyer, 35 U. La Verne L. Rev. 205, 208 (2014)  Public interest lawyering  Public interest law is \\"the legal practice that advances social justice or other causes for the public good\\".Public Interest Law, Black's Law Dictionary, 612 (Fourth Pocket Edition, 2011). In its most simple form, public interest is defined as \\"(1) the general welfare of the public that warrants recognition and protection\\" and \\"(2) [s]omething in which the public has a stake ...\\"Public Interest, Black's Law Dictionary, 612 (Fourth Pocket Edition, 2011).  History  The public interest notation was first given to a group of lawyers in the 1960s who fought to address the social injustice that existed in American society.Ann Southworth, What Is Public Interest Law? Empirical Perspectives on an Old Question, 62 DePaul L. Rev. 493 (2013) Throughout the late 20th century, many lawyers self- defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to gain legitimacy and respect as they sought to change complex social, political, environmental, and educational problems. As a result of many attorney's desire to participate in public interest law, organizations, such as the ACLU and NAACP, were formed to develop a collaborative approach to addressing these societal problems. Today, public interest lawyering has expanded greatly to include free legal aid groups, liberal and conservative public interest organizations, partisan environmental groups, and individual lawyers who choose to represent the underrepresented.  Definition and debate  Ford Foundation With the increase in self-proclaimed public interest lawyers, the definition and categorization of public interest lawyering continues to be a debated topic. In attempt to narrow the categorization of public interest lawyering, many scholars and researchers have attempted to create a more precise definition of \\"public interest law\\". The Ford Foundation was one of the first groups to attempt to define public interest law as an \\"[a]ctivity that (1) is undertaken by an organization in the voluntary sector; (2) provides fuller representation of underrepresented interests (would produce external benefits if successful); and (3) involves the use of law instruments, primarily litigation.\\"Burton A. Weisbrod, Conceptual Perspective on the Public Interest: An Economic Analysis, in Public Interest Law: An Economic and Institutional Analysis 22 Looking at the role of public interest law groups, Laura Beth Nielsen and Catherine Albiston defined public interest law groups as \\"organizations in the voluntary sector that employ at least one lawyer at least part time, and whose activities (1) seek to produce significant benefits for those who are external to the organization's participants, and (2) involve at least one adjudicatory strategy.\\"Laura Beth Nielsen & Catherine R. Albiston, The Organization of Public Interest Practice: 1975-2004, 84 N.C. L. Rev. 1591 (2006) Looking at public interest law as a more broad category, Scott Cummings suggests that public interest law is the legal means that advance the interest of disadvantaged people by way of challenging corporate or governmental policies and practices.Scott L. Cummings, The Internationalization of Public Interest Law, 57 Duke L.J. 891, 1034-35 (2008) Other scholars have defined public interest laws not by what a lawyer does but by a lawyer's financial self- sacrifice.Howard M. Erichson, Doing Good, Doing Well, 57 Vand. L. Rev. 2087, 2092 (2004). When discussing young lawyers who are influencing change, Karen Dillon stated that public interest lawyers are those who \\"have followed their hearts, not necessarily their wallets, into careers that they are convinced will make a difference in the world\\".Karen Dillon & Jim Schroeder, The Public Sector 45: Forty-five Young Lawyers Outside the Private Sector Whose Vision and Commitment are Changing Lives, Am. Law., Jan./Feb. 1997, at 80. Pro bono work of lawyers has become synonymous with the public good, and there is no debate that a majority of pro bono attorneys do contribute to the public good.  Public interest and politics  There are multiple ideological groups that unite on specific issues and work towards advances the causes that they believe are in the public interest. The early successes of the public interest movements prompted the emergence of public interest law firms, advocating on divisive political issues. In their discussion of cause lawyering, Scheingold and Sarat suggest that cause lawyering, \\"conveys a determination to take sides in political or moral struggle without making distinctions between worthy and unworthy cause\\".Scheingold and Sarat Today, public interest law firms are at the forefront of public interest groups and political advocacy organizations. When partisan public interest organizations first gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s it was the liberal groups that bound together to promote significant social change. Drawing from the strategies developed by previous groups to advance specific causes, like the NAACP, ACLU and LDF, these public interest groups expanded their role to substantive law reform, litigation, and administrative and legislative advocacy.See Mark V. Tushnet, The NCAAP's Legal Strategy Against Segregated Education, 1925-1950 at 105-137 (1987). Because of this expansion in services offered, these groups began employing lawyers to create more lasting substantive change through legal reform. In response to the success of liberal groups advancing their partisan agendas, conservatives began to adopt this type of organization and developed public interest groups of their own.Southworth at 493 Many of the first conservative public interest groups (the National Right to Work Committee, National Right to Life Committee, Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights), were created to advance very specific policy goals.Id. at 497 - 501 These groups do not necessarily advance the public's interest but are intertwined with corporations and lobbying efforts to advance the interest that benefit their clients and result in financial gain for them. Since their inception, the role in public interest groups in politics has increased drastically, with many of them funding political action committee (PACs) with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting campaigns based on the candidate's stance on important issues. Public interest groups on both sides of the aisle have expanded their roles tremendously and can even be attributed to the divisive political arena that exist today. While their roles have expanded, their overall goals have not. Partisan public interest groups continue pursuing the causes that connect with their ideological beliefs and continue to have successes in advancing these interests.  Community economic development lawyering  Community economic development work includes building coalitions of interested parties to create social policies that improve affordable housing opportunities, increases access to affordable financing options, develops workforce skills, and generally produces more economic production within suffering urban and rural communities.Roger A. Clay and Susan R Jones, Building Healthy Communities, A guide to Community Economic Development for Advocates, Lawyers, and Policymakers, American Bar Association, 10, (2009) In order to serve their client, CED lawyers are required to be proficient in many areas of the law which include: business, finance, environmental studies, real estate, architecture, public policy, education, employment and human resources, community organizing, organizational development, and change theory among other subjects.Susan R Jones, Current Issues in the Changing Roles and Practices of Community Economic Development Lawyers, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System, 1, (2002)  History  Community economic development efforts have been traced back to the early 1900s to the Tuskegee Institute. During that time Booker T. Washington believed that the best way to advance African Americans interests was through encouraging economic self- sufficiency through encouraging job training and entrepreneurship.Scott L. Cummings, Community Economic Development as Progressive Politics: Toward a Grassroots Movement for Economic Justice, 54 Stan. L. Rev. 399, 410 (2001) He believed that through economic self-sufficiency, hard work, and property ownership, African American communities would, on their own, create greater levels of wealth accumulation within the African community. To achieve his vision, Washington created vocational training programs and presided over the National Business League with the goal of supporting African American business networks, products, and services. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement brought about changes to Community Economic Developments advocacy by focusing on grassroots programs in order to achieve greater levels of equality in poor urban and rural communities. Groups like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Poor People's Movement began lobbying the Federal Government to create an economic bill of rights which demanded, among other things, improving the economic conditions within underrepresented urban and rural communities. In response, the Federal government created focused programs that targeted disadvantaged communities by providing increased education, job training, and family services. Beginning with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, both state and federal governments began to reinvest in struggling urban and rural communities through the creation of Enterprise Zones. The purpose of the newly created Enterprise Zones was to stimulate job creation within urban communities through tax breaks to relocating companies, job training and ultimately economic growth.Hirasuna, D. & J. Michael. Enterprise Zones: A Review of the Economic Theory and Empirical Evidence. House Research Department. January (2005) Despite their good intentions, empirical studies have concluded that unless the underlying conditions are ready for economic development, the net benefit of the economic zone program is minimal. According to these studies, the underlying conditions needed to improve an economic zones chances of success are: low unemployment, high levels of investment and suburbs.  Criticisms of CED  According to Audrey G. McFarlane, CED lawyering efforts have fallen short of their intended goals of building economic development within a community.Jones at 25 McFarlane asserts that the economic transformation within Economic Zones has failed in three ways. First, the structure of the economic stimulus has been designed to benefit large corporations that generally do not require high paying jobs. Second, the very fact that the programs are assigned to a geographical location further strengths the stigma associated with investing in \\"ghettos\\". Finally, simply providing a job does not address the entire problem facing a community and should include housing programs, workforce development, and food security among other things.  Organizations  A significant portion of cause lawyering is done through special interest groups or legal advocacy organizations. Cause lawyering groups are a type of public interest law organization (PILO). These organizations are generally structured as 501(c)(3) nonprofits. These organizations are generally tied to specific social movements.Sandra R. Levitsky, To Lead with Law: Reassessing the Influence of Legal Advocacy Organizations in Social Movements, in Cause Lawyers and Social Movements 145 (Scheingold and Sarat eds. 2006). For example, there are legal advocacy organizations for a wide range of causes such as environmentalism, racial justice, feminism, Evangelical Christianity, consumers, the poor, and civil liberties. These organizations allow cause lawyers to pool time and resources to develop complex litigation strategies for their causes. They often employ staff, have formal members, rely on grant or foundation funding, and even operate on a national scale. American Civil Liberties Union These groups may use \\"test cases\\" to change the law to reach the group's political goal. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) famously defended John Scopes in the Scopes Monkey Trial. In 1925, Tennessee passed the Butler Act which outlawed the teaching of evolution. The ACLU offered to defend anyone arrested for teaching evolution in violation of the Butler Act. High school biology teacher. Scopes urged students to testify against him and he was eventually arrested under the Butler Act. Clarence Darrow defended Scopes on behalf of the ACLU. Although Scopes lost at trial, the proceedings were heavily publicized and changed public opinion on the role of faith in public schools. Legal advocacy groups also educate the public and political leaders about their causes, sometimes through litigation.  Notable legal advocacy groups  Southern Poverty Law Center While the ACLU concerns itself with a broad array of civil rights issues, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) share a narrower focus on racial justice issues. Spearheaded by lawyer and future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP used planned litigation to reverse the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine in Brown v. Board of Education. Other prominent legal advocacy groups include the Animal Legal Defense Fund, Center for Constitutional Rights, Innocence Project, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights under Law, Legal Momentum, and the Sylvia Rivera Law Project. Legal advocacy organizations span the political spectrum. Originally, these groups tended to support politically liberal causes. Today, there are many politically conservative legal advocacy organizations, such as the Liberty Counsel.Den Dulk, In Legal Culture but Not of it: The Role of Cause Lawyers in Evangelical Legal Mobilization in Cause Lawyers and Social Movements 197 (Scheingold and Sarat eds. 2006). Many of such groups are called Christian conservative legal organizations (CCLOs).Daniel Bennett, The Rise of Christian Conservative Legal Organizations, Religion & Politics (June 10, 2015), http://religionandpolitics.org/2015/06/10/the-rise-of-christian- conservative-legal-organizations/. The Alliance Defending Freedom and American Center for Law and Justice are also prominent CCLOs. CCLOs tend to focus their litigation on religious freedom, opposing same-sex marriage, and the right to life movement.  Criticisms of legal advocacy groups  Some grassroots organizations criticize national legal advocacy groups for dominating social movements. Legal advocacy groups may set the political agendas of social movements because legal advocacy groups generally have significantly more resources than grassroots activist groups. Additionally, legal advocacy groups may use a \\"top-down\\" approach to identifying and solving social problems without considering the actual needs of groups at the grassroots level.  Trends   United States trends  In 2004, Joel F. Handler conducted research that focused on how public interest law firms have changed over time. Citing a 1978 Weisbrod study,Burton A. Weisbrod et al., _Public Interest Law: An Economic and Institutional Analysis_ , 1-3, 50-60, University of California Press (1978) Handler surveyed other cause lawyers to determine how cause lawyering has changed over time. According to the study, cause lawyer organizations have become multi-issue driven as opposed to the single issue focus held in the past.Nielsen at 1615 In addition to expanding the scope of a public interest practice, Handler cites that this shift has also included the expansion into other non-legal advocacy which includes: researching, writing and, conducting education and outreach programs.Id. Due to the diversification of public interest organizations, the focus of most public interest organizations has become more diluted. Handler found that since 1975, the historically liberal public interest topics have, for the most part, experienced a decline in the percent of effort expended.Id. at 1616 Offsetting this decrease, Handler notes that growth has primarily been experienced within conservative public interest issues and addressing housing issues.  International trends  Cause lawyering has recently taken on a more international emphasis with lawyers working to produce social change most notably within the People's Republic of China. Primarily focused on expanding the recognition of human rights, Chinese public interest lawyers have attempted to change the government by litigating high-profile cases and organizing public gatherings demanding government reform. In response, the Chinese government has attempted to silence the cause lawyers by limiting their efficacy through \\"law based\\" restrictions and \\"extra-legal\\" measures.The Leitner Center for International Law and Justice, Plight and Prospects: The Landscape for Cause Lawyers in China, Committee to Support Chinese Lawyers (2015), http://inthumrights.blogspot.com/2015/10/plight- prospects-landscape-for-cause.html According to the Leitner Center, the Communist Party of China has been instrumental in passing laws that limit Chinese lawyers ability to effectively practice law by restricting access to clients, charging registration fees and coercing lawyers to drop unpopular cases in exchange for more favorable licensing treatment. In addition to these \\"law based\\" restrictions, the Leitner Center has documented cases where lawyers have been detained and even disappeared after refusing to drop unpopular cases. Cause lawyers in South American countries have begun to advocate more effectively by forming cause-lawyering networks. Covering a wide range of issues, these networks primarily focus on issues surrounding human rights and the environment.Austin Sarat Stuart Scheingold, _Latin American Cause Lawyering Networks in Cause Lawyering and the State in a Global Era_ , 307 (Oxford Press, 2001) In Japan cause lawyers are playing an increasing role in migrants rights. They have formed cause lawyering organization especially to protect the human rights of asylum seekers and temporary migrant workers in the Technical Intern Training Program.

Graythorp today is an industrial estate historically associated with a shipyard basin currently operated by Able UK as a marine recycling facility.  Graythorp shipyard and dock In 1913 the Hartlepool shipbuilders William Gray & Company leased land to construct a shipyard off Greatham Creek near the mouth of the Tees capable of building ships of 20,000 tons in weight. Due to the First World War the yard was not completed until 1924 and became known as Graythorp Shipyard, Gray constructed ships there from 1924 until the company closed in 1963. In 1969 after liquidation the yard was purchased by Laing Offshore. In 1970 Laing added dock gates to create a dry dock, at the time the largest in the world, and with it constructed offshore oil and gas platforms, and jackets (platform legs) from 1970 to 1990. In 1996 Able UK Ltd purchased the yard and used it to do dismantling work for several petrochemical companies, while allowing the tenant construction of other marine structures. In 2003 Able UK signed an ¬£11m deal with the US Marine Administration to dismantle 13 US warships; subsequently the process was opposed by some local residents and environmental groups due to the presence of asbestos and other toxins on the ships.

History This festival was introduced to Hawaii with the arrival of Protestant missionaries, and is believed to have started after 1820. Most of the traditions they currently celebrate come from the missionaries. Before the Hawaiians celebrated the Christmas people know today, they had a festival named Makahiki which lasted around four months and in which all wars were forbidden. The season still had the essence of \\"peace and goodwill to all men\\", which is another thing people tend to associate with Christmas. The first recorded Christmas in Hawaii was in 1786, when the captain of merchant ship the Queen Charlotte, George Dixon, was docked on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Dixon and his crew celebrated a large Christmas dinner that included a whole roast pig. King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma of Hawaii officially celebrated Christmas in 1856 as a day of Thanksgiving. On Christmas Eve of 1858 Mary Dominis threw a party at Washington Place featuring the first instance of a Christmas tree and Santa Claus in Hawaii. King Kamehameha IV declared it an official holiday in 1862. Celebrations today The annual Honolulu City Lights ceremony features a 50-foot Norfolk pine Christmas tree decorated with bright lights and elaborate decorations. There is also live entertainment. The traditions on Christmas day are similar to other places; a large meal is eaten and then, as the beach is often nearby in Hawaii, surfing or swimming often takes place in the waters, and musical groups with guitars and ukuleles and dancing hula entertain the crowds on the beach. Santa hats are worn and the traditional Santa's sleigh and reindeer are replaced by an outrigger canoe pulled by dolphins. The different cultures and ethnic groups that have settled in the islands celebrate the Christmas traditions of Hawaii in their own unique ways, which may be religious or plainly secular. Even Santa Claus (Hawaiian: Kanakaloka) himself is not wearing his corporate red and white suit, but has swapped it for flowery Hawaiian clothes. Christmas wreaths are made from the poinsettia plant. Mele Kalikimaka Mele Kalikimaka The phrase \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" can be translated from Hawaiian to mean \\"Merry Christmas\\".Elbert, S. & Pukui, M.; Hawaiian Dictionary, page 481 It is also a Hawaiian themed Christmas song composed by Robert Alex Anderson in 1949. The phrase is borrowed directly from English, but, since Hawaiian has a different phonological system (in particular, Hawaiian does not possess the or of English, nor does it have the phonotactic constraints to allow consonants at the end of a syllable), \\"Merry Christmas\\" becomes \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\". There is also a more modern take on this song, called \\"Melekalikimaka\\" by rock band The Beach Boys from the compilation album Ultimate Christmas.

History Harlow Bolton established the community in 1854. While much of Farmington was settled by German immigrants, Boltonville was a center of Irish immigration. The early settlers used Stony Creek to power grist and saw mills. There was also a cheese factory, as well as shops, a post office, and a school. In 1860, a group of Irish Catholics built a churching the community. The building was replaced by the St. John of God Church in 1891. In 1868, the Sisters of St. Agnes, a Catholic order founded in the Village of Barton, Wisconsin, built a school and a convent on the St. John of God Church property. The nuns served as public school teachers until at least 1892, and also taught parochial classes in the convent until 1879. Both buildings were abandoned around the turn of the century and were stripped for materials in the 1930s. In 1872, a group of Free Will Baptists from New England established a church run Boltonville. They had previously lived in the neighboring Town of Trenton. The building became St. John's Evangelical Congregation in 1905 and is currently home to St. John's United Church of Christ.

De-identification is the process used to prevent someone's personal identity from being revealed. For example, data produced during human subject research might be de-identified to preserve the privacy of research participants. When applied to metadata or general data about identification, the process is also known as data anonymization. Common strategies include deleting or masking personal identifiers, such as personal name, and suppressing or generalizing quasi-identifiers, such as date of birth. The reverse process of using de-identified data to identify individuals is known as data re-identification. Successful re-identifications cast doubt on de-identification's effectiveness. A systematic review of fourteen distinct re-identification attacks found \\"a high re-identification rate [‚Ä¶] dominated by small-scale studies on data that was not de-identified according to existing standards.\\" De-identification is adopted as one of the main approaches toward data privacy protection. It is commonly used in fields of communications, multimedia, biometrics, big data, cloud computing, data mining, internet, social networks and audio‚Äìvideo surveillance. Examples  In designing surveys  A survey is conducted, such as a census, to collect information about a group of people. To encourage participation and to protect the privacy of survey respondents, the researchers attempt to design the survey in a way that when people participate in a survey, it will not be possible to match any participant's individual response(s) with any data published.  Before using information  When an online shopping website wants to know its users' preferences and shopping habits, it decides to retrieve customers' data from its database and do analysis on them. The personal data information include personal identifiers which were collected directly when customers created their accounts. The website needs to pre- handle the data through de-identification techniques before analyzing data records to avoid violating their customers' privacy. Anonymization Anonymization refers to irreversibly severing a data set from the identity of the data contributor in a study to prevent any future re-identification, even by the study organizers under any condition. De-identification may also include preserving identifying information which can only be re-linked by a trusted party in certain situations. There is a debate in the technology community on whether data that can be re-linked, even by a trusted party, should ever be considered de-identified.  Techniques  Common strategies of de-identification are masking personal identifiers and generalizing quasi- identifiers. Pseudonymization is the main technique used to mask personal identifiers from data records and k-anonymization is usually adopted for generalizing quasi-identifiers.  Pseudonymization  Pseudonymization is performed by replacing real names with a temporary ID. It deletes or masks personal identifiers to make individuals unidentified. This method makes it possible to track the individual's record over time even though the record will be updated. However, it can not prevent the individual from being identified if some specific combinations of attributes in data record indirectly identify the individual.  k-anonymization  k-anonymization defines attributes that indirectly points to the individual's identity as quasi-identifiers (QIs) and deal with data by making at least k individuals have same combination of QI values. QI values are handled following specific standards. For example, the k-anonymization replaces some original data in the records with new range values and keep some values unchanged. New combination of QI values prevents the individual from being identified and also avoid destroying data records. Applications Research into de-identification is driven mostly for protecting health information. Some libraries have adopted methods used in the healthcare industry to preserve their readers' privacy. In big data, de-identification is widely adopted by individuals and organizations. With the development of social media, e-commerce, and big data, de-identification is sometimes required and often used for data privacy when users' personal data are collected by companies or third-party organizations who will analyze it for their own personal usage. In smart cities, de- identification may be required to protect the privacy of residents, workers and visitors. Without strict regulation, de-identification may be difficult because sensors can still collect information without consent. Limits Whenever a person participates in genetics research, the donation of a biological specimen often results in the creation of a large amount of personalized data. Such data is uniquely difficult to de-identify. Anonymization of genetic data is particularly difficult because of the huge amount of genotypic information in biospecimens, the ties that specimens often have to medical history, and the advent of modern bioinformatics tools for data mining. There have been demonstrations that data for individuals in aggregate collections of genotypic data sets can be tied to the identities of the specimen donors. Some researchers have suggested that it is not reasonable to ever promise participants in genetics research that they can retain their anonymity, but instead such participants should be taught the limits of using coded identifiers in a de-identification process. De-identification laws in the United States of America  In May 2014, the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found de-identification \\"somewhat useful as an added safeguard\\" but not \\"a useful basis for policy\\" as \\"it is not robust against near‚Äêterm future re‚Äêidentification methods\\". The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides mechanisms for using and disclosing health data responsibly without the need for patient consent. These mechanisms center on two HIPAA de-identification standards ‚Äì Safe Harbor and the Expert Determination Method. Safe Harbor relies on the removal of specific patient identifiers (e.g. name, phone number, email address, etc.) while the Expert Determination Method requires knowledge and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods to render information not individually identifiable. Safe harbor The safe harbor method uses a list approach to de-identification and has two requirements: # The removal or generalization of 18 elements from the data. # That the Covered Entity or Business Associate does not have actual knowledge that the residual information in the data could be used alone, or in combination with other information, to identify an individual. Safe Harbor is a highly prescriptive approach to de-identification. Under this method, all dates must be generalized to year and zip codes reduced to three digits. The same approach is used on the data regardless of the context. Even if the information is to be shared with a trusted researcher who wishes to analyze the data for seasonal variations in acute respiratory cases and, thus, requires the month of hospital admission, this information cannot be provided; only the year of admission would be retained. Expert Determination Expert Determination takes a risk-based approach to de-identification that applies current standards and best practices from the research to determine the likelihood that a person could be identified from their protected health information. This method requires that a person with appropriate knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods render the information not individually identifiable. It requires: # That the risk is very small that the information could be used alone, or in combination with other reasonably available information, by an anticipated recipient to identify an individual who is a subject of the information; # Documents the methods and results of the analysis that justify such a determination. Research on decedents The key law about research in electronic health record data is HIPAA Privacy Rule. This law allows use of electronic health record of deceased subjects for research (HIPAA Privacy Rule (section 164.512(i)(1)(iii))).

It was built in 1633 for Sir Archibald Acheson, 1st Baronet, Secretary of State of Scotland for King Charles I. It did not stay in the Acheson family, and during the 19th century it declined like much of the Old Town. Slum clearance led the city council to acquire the building in 1924, but the Marquess of Bute bought it to have it restored during the 1930s. It was later used by church and arts groups, but was vacant between 1991 and 2011. In November 2011, Acheson House became the base for the Edinburgh World Heritage Trust. The ground floor of the building will become part of the Museum of Edinburgh, based in the adjacent Huntly House. The house is on the Canongate, the lower part of the Royal Mile, and is protected as a category A listed building as an \\"outstanding example of a large, early 17th century Scottish townhouse.\\" History Sir Archibald Acheson (c.1580‚Äì1634) was a Scottish lawyer who emigrated to Ireland in 1610. He maintained his position in Scotland however, serving as a member of the Parliament of Scotland in 1625, and being appointed a Lord of Session in 1627. Some time before 1634 he held the office of Secretary of State, Scotland in the government of Charles I. Sir Archibald and his wife, Margaret Hamilton, built Acheson House in 1633, but he may never have lived there, dying the following year. In 1636 the house was sold to Edinburgh merchant Patrick Wood. It passed through many owners, including the Incorporation of Bakers in 1784. The house was subdivided in the 18th century. A brothel had been established in the house by the early 19th century. Between 1830 and 1924 it was owned by the Slater family. In the 20th century, declining living standards in the Old Town prompted widespread slum clearance. In preparation for this, Acheson House was bought by the city council, but the house came to the attention of the 4th Marquess of Bute, a keen antiquarian who also supported the restoration of Gladstone's Land and houses on Charlotte Square. Lord Bute purchased the house in 1935, and commissioned architect Robert Hurd to carry out an extensive but sympathetic restoration. In 1938 it was suggested that the house could become the official residence of the Secretary of State for Scotland, but the following year it was acquired by the Canongate Kirk and was used by the Iona Community, an ecumenical group. Between 1947 and 1951 an educational book publisher and his wife and five children used it as their family home. From 1951 it became the Scottish Craft Centre, a showcase for contemporary Scottish craftwork. The Craft Centre closed in 1991, and the building was empty for 20 years. It was added to the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland in 2000. By 2007 plans had been prepared to incorporate the building into the Museum of Edinburgh, located in Huntly House, next door to Acheson House on the Canongate. During 2011 the house was renovated, and in November the Edinburgh World Heritage Trust moved into the building from its previous base at 5 Charlotte Square. Bakehouse Close gateway Description The three-storey L-plan house faces the Canongate to the north, and Bakehouse Close to the west. The house is set back from the Canongate, with a small forecourt entered via a timber door. Formerly located in Anchor Close, the stone lintel above this door is inscribed \\"O Lord In Thee Is All My Traist\\". The gateway from Bakehouse Close was brought from Carberry Tower in East Lothian in the 1930s restoration. Above the door to the stair-tower the date 1633 is carved, together with the initials of Archibald Acheson and Margaret Hamilton, and the Acheson family crest: a cock and trumpet. The forecourt garden is to be restored as part of the renovation of the house.

However, the missing fragment or possibly fragments, a right-hand side of the head including upper part of the ear, have not yet been found. The heavily stylized facial features are projected on an almost flat surface surrounded by braid-like shaped hair. At the back of the head the hair appears to be shaved in a tonsure. The most prominent are the bulging oval eyes, contoured by a curvilinear eyebrow matching a similarly imposing curvilinear moustache. The mouth is suggested by a mere downward bending line.Venclov√°, N., \\"The Venerable Bede, druidic tonsure and archaeology\\", (Antiquity, 2002, 76:458-71) The ears are not naturalistic but rather represented as lotus buds, a stylistic form representative of La T√®ne art.Jacobstahl, P. Early Celtic Art, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1944) The neck is formed in a shape of a torc, a traditional Celtic necklace. A similar torc can be seen on the second-century B.C. sculpture of a Dying Gaul from Pergamon. Background The visual imagery of the La T√®ne period was characterized by an ubiquitous appearance of an anthropomorphic head symbol typical of Central and Western Celtic Europe Megaw and Megaw, Celtic Art. From its Beginning to the Book of Kells, (New York, NY: Thames and Hudson, 1989) These images were skillfully entwined in ornaments, handles, jewelry and reliefs fashioned mostly of metals. Anthropomorphic sculpture itself was extraordinarily rare and few examples survive today. The Celtic Hero was found during a course of 1943 excavation of an oppidum in M≈°eck√© ≈Ωehrovice in central Bohemia, Czech Republic. The sculpture was buried in a pit on a southwest corner of a square enclosure located within the oppidum. Other artifacts found in the pit include burned animal bones that date the feature to late La T√®ne period LT C2-D1 (approx. 150-50 BC.), pottery sherds, pieces of saprolite and a piece of iron wire.

It was the topic of his doctoral dissertation, ‚ÄúAspects of Literary Anti-Semitism: Dickens and Freytag‚Äù (Yale: 1980). His foundational scholarly article, \\"What is Literary Anti-Semitism?\\" (1985) appeared in Jewish Social Studies (then published by Columbia University in New York).. According to Gelber: \\"‚Ä¶any useful definition of literary anti-Semitism must proceed from literature itself, that is, from texts... literary anti-Semitism may be defined as the potential or capacity of a text to encourage or positively evaluate anti-Semitic attitudes or behaviors, in accordance, generally, with the delineation of such attitudes and behaviors by social scientists and historians. Just as social scientists are careful to locate and identify anti-Semitism according to indices of attitudes and behaviors, literary scholars must attempt to understand precisely how anti-Semitic attitudes manifest themselves in literature and how 'anti-Semitically charged elements' function and interact in texts.\\"See \\"30 Years of Austrian/German-Jewish Literary Cultural Studies\\" conference program. His other articles on literary (and filmic) anti-Semitism have focused on Charles Dickens, Gustav Freytag, Julius Langbehn, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Thomas Mann, T.S.

Numerous scholarly reviewers, including Ritchie Robertson (Oxford), Gerhard Kurz (Giessen) and Armin A. Wallas (Klagenfurt) were unanimous in their high praise this study.Gelber, Mark H.

Studien zu Werk und Biographie\\". His own essay in this volume argues for the understanding of a \\"Fourth Life\\" in the career of Stefan Zweig and includes an analysis from this perspective of Zweig's book on Brazil (\\"Brasilien. Ein Land der Zukunft\\") in relation to his famous autobiography, \\"Die Welt von Gestern.\\" In November 2016 Gelber lectured in Hebrew at a major event in memory of Zweig, organized by the National Library of Israel entitled: Stefan Zweig, the Future, and the Literary World between the World Wars. Also, Gelber contributed the entry on \\"Judentum und j√ºdische Identit√§t\\" to the authoritative \\"Stefan Zweig Handbook\\"(De Gruyter, 2018).  Yiddish- German Literary Relations  Following in the footsteps of one of his mentors, Professor Solomon Liptzin, for whom he edited Identity and Ethos: A Festschrift for Sol Liptzin on the Occasion of His 85th Birthday,Gelber, Mark (Ed). Identity and Ethos: A Festschrift for Sol Liptzin on the Occasion of his 85th Birthday (Bern: Peter Lang, 1986) Gelber has contributed numerous articles in the field of Yiddish-German literary relations. In this area he has published on Heinrich Heine and Yiddish; Stefan Zweig, Sholem Asch and Yiddish; Stefan Zweig, Yiddish and East European Literature and Culture; on Yiddish lexical items (and multilingualism) in the work of Stefan Zweig, Fanya Heller, and Ruth Kl√ºger. An essay on Rose Ausl√§nder in Jewish Cultural Spaces (including Yiddish and German) of Early Twentieth-Century Eastern Europe (Bukowina), based on a lecture delivered in Wellington, New Zealand, was published in the memorial volume for Petra Ernst in 2020.A selection of articles and books on the subject of Yiddish-German Literary Relations includes: Mark H.

In his lecture at the International Kafka Conference held in Prague in 2016, \\"Kafka and Interculturality,\\" Gelber spoke about the literary relationship between one of the major figures in the modern Yiddish revival, Nathan Birnbaum, and Franz Kafka. In the framework of an intercultural investigation, it can be shown that there is much more to this relationship than merely a Yiddish-German (language) connection.  German- Jewish Studies  Gelber has published extensively in the field of German- Jewish Literature and Culture, which he views as a ‚Äúdiscipline in its own right.‚ÄùGelber, Mark H. \\"German-Jewish Literature and Culture and the Field of German Jewish Studies.\\" The Jewish Contribution to Civilization: Reassessing an Idea.

In a published essay based on a conference lecture he gave in Tel Aviv in 2004, and entitled ‚ÄúGerman-Jewish Literature and Culture and the Field of German- Jewish Studies,‚Äù he wrote: ‚ÄúThis discipline may be discerned between the boundaries of Germanistik on one side and Jewish Studies on the other, although such fields as Exile Studies (and Diaspora Studies) and Holocaust Studies (and Memory Studies), which also emerged from and appear to be tangential to German and Jewish Studies respectively, also border on and derive synergistic intellectual energy from German-Jewish Studies.‚ÄùSee prev. footnote for citation.

The terminus was Polton. The line opened on 15 April 1867 In the nineteenth century passenger use of the line was buoyant, but it declined substantially when road transport services became widespread from the 1920s. The passenger service was withdrawn in 1951, and the goods service closed after the decline of the local industries, in 1964. No railway use is made of the former line now. History The Peebles Railway After the frenzy of railway promotion in Scotland in 1845, many communities in areas that did not have a railway saw that they were at a disadvantage: goods they required, especially coal, and lime for improving land, were much more expensive than at railway towns; and their own manufactures cost more to move to markets elsewhere. The people of Peebles promoted their own railway and the Peebles Railway opened in 1855, joining the line that became the Waverley Route near Dalkeith, and connecting the town with Edinburgh. From Eskbank the Peebles line crossed high ground south-east of the valley of the River North Esk. The valley was already heavily industrialised with at least three paper mills, which required access to plentiful water; in addition carpets were made locally and corn was milled. The Esk Valley Railway System map of the Esk Valley RailwayFrom 1860 local promoters negotiated with the North British Railway (NBR; the NBR was working the Peebles Railway) over the construction of a branch line to Polton from the Peebles line. At this time there was intense rivalry between the NBR and the Caledonian Railway, especially over retaining a monopoly of service in any geographical area while attempting to penetrate the rival's area. The NBR were quick to act in support of the line to Polton, fearing that the Caledonian would enter the district otherwise; indeed the Caledonian had published proposals to build a line into the area, from Slateford via Penicuik to Dalkeith.W and E A Munro, Lost Railways of Midlothian, self published by W & E A Munro, 1985 The NBR paid the Parliamentary deposit for the Bill to be presented.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The Polton branch line became the Esk Valley Railway, and was authorised by Act of Parliament of 21 July 1863.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, It was to be two miles in length. The little company found it difficult to raise capital, and the NBR subscribed ¬£10,000. Notwithstanding that difficulty, the Company proposed an extension to Penicuik, but agreed to withdraw it when the North British Railway proposed to lease its line (construction of which was hardly started) for ¬£1,350 a year, equivalent to 5% on its share capital of ¬£27,000. The lease was authorised by Parliament on 16 July 1866. A start on building the line was delayed, not starting until 5 September 1864, and the construction of the line was complex as it had to follow the narrow valley of the River North Esk. There was a 471-yard tunnel between Bonnyrigg and Lasswade, and a six-arch stone viaduct at Lasswade. Opening Viaduct at PoltonWhen the line was nearing completion, the Company announced that train services would start on 1 April 1867. Two stations were provided on the line, Bonnyrigg (later renamed Broomieknowe) and Polton. The NBR had agreed to work (and lease) the line but refused to do so immediately because a station had not been constructed at Lasswade, as they had expected. The Esk Valley Company protested that they were not bound to provide the station, and the matter went to arbitration. Pending the conclusion of that, the NBR agreed to commence operation on 15 April 1867, and for accounting purposes (that is, payment of the lease charge) the \\"official\\" commencing date would be 8 April 1867.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways, Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, So trains started running on 15 April.Quick, Ross, Thomas (NBR, volume 1, and also Forgotten Railways) and Paterson; Marshall says 18 April 1867; Munro says 12 October 1868. When the line opened, it was worked by the North British Railway.Peter Marshall, Peebles Railways, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2005, M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 The arbitrator found that the EVR was indeed bound to provide the Lasswade station, and it did so, opening it on 12 October 1868; construction of the station cost it six months rental of the entire line. The Esk Valley Railway company was absorbed by the North British Railway on 1 July 1871.Munro. Awdry says the EVR was absorbed by the NBR by Act of 13 July 1871 with effect from 31 July. Ross and Thomas say \\"on 13 July 1871\\". The terms guaranteed the EVR shareholders a 3.5% dividend on their holding. The valedictory shareholders' meeting of the EVR heard the Chairman declare: > Through unforeseen circumstances the expenditure of the Company has > considerably exceeded what was at first anticipated, but notwithstanding of > this the directors trust that the benefit done to the district and the > securing to the shareholders a permanent dividend of 3.25% is not an > inadequate return for the labour and money expended.Chairman's address, > quoted in Thomas, Forgotten Railways Train service The line generated a considerable residential passenger business and an early outer suburban traffic for Edinburgh included Polton in its network. Remains of Broomieknowe station photographed in 1962. In 1895 there were four daily passenger trains in each direction, with two more on Saturdays, between Eskbank and Polton. Some of these were through trains from Edinburgh. The journey time between Eskbank and Polton was typically 12 minutes. There was no Sunday service. The twentieth century The North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) from 1923, following the Railways Act 1921 and the railways were again re-organised by Government in 1948, when the railways were nationalised, the local lines being part of British Railways Scottish Region. In 1950 there were still six passenger trains in each direction, but by this time road transport had made heavy inroads into passenger business on the line, and the passenger service closed on 10 September 1951,John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, though a passenger excursion train traversed the line in August 1963.Gordon Stansfield, Lost Railways of the Lothians, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2003, Polton Mill had closed shortly after World War II, and Springfield Mill closed in 1966. The line remained open for goods traffic until it too closed on 18 May 1964 following the run down of the mills. Current use The course of the Esk Valley Railway is traceable for much of its length although no part of it has been designated as a public footpath. The tunnel at Lasswade has been sealed although both portals are fairly easily accessible. Lasswade Viaduct is Grade B listed and is not accessible. Topography The Esk Valley Railway made a junction with the Peebles Railway at Hardengreen Junction, but it ran parallel and adjacent to the Edinburgh, Loanhead and Roslin Railway for a short distance, as far as Esk Valley Junction. The two companies agreed to operate the track as a double line instead of two single lines between Hardengreen Junction and Esk Valley Junction. Locations on the line were: * Hardengreen Junction; divergence from the Peebles Railway; * Esk Valley Junction; divergence from the Edinburgh Loanhead and Roslin Railway; * Bonnyrigg; opened 15 April 1867; renamed Broomieknowe 1868; closed 1 January 1917; re-opened 1 April 1919; closed 10 September 1951; * Lasswade; opened 12 October 1868; closed 10 September 1951; * Polton; opened 10 April 1867; closed 10 September 1951.

Shea (June 16, 1905 ‚Äì August 8, 1989) was an American lawyer, law professor and United States government official. Early life and education Born in Manchester, New Hampshire, Francis Michael Shea (also known as Frank Shea) was a son of New Hampshire state senator and attorney Michael Shea and Margaret (Muldoon) Shea. He attended and graduated from Dartmouth College (A.B., 1925) and Harvard Law School (LL.B., 1928). Career Following law school, Shea obtained, through a referral from his law school professor Felix Frankfurter, a position practicing law with a prominent attorney, John Lord O'Brian, in Buffalo, New York. From 1929-1933, Shea lived in Buffalo and practiced with the law firm of Slee, O'Brian, Hellings and Ulsh. In 1933, Shea moved to Washington to join the New Deal. He became a lawyer in the Agriculture Adjustment Administration. During 1935-1936, he was general counsel to the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration. In 1936, Shea returned to Buffalo and became dean of the University of Buffalo School of Law. Implementing the University Council's order to upgrade the school, Shea hired fellow Harvard graduates Louis L. Jaffe, Mark DeWolfe Howe, David Reisman, Jr. and others to join the faculty. Shea also expanded the school's library, intensified the moot court program and emphasized the casebook/Socratic, rather than the textbook/lecture, method of teaching. In 1936, the law school was admitted to the Association of American Law Schools (AALS). In 1937, the school received American Bar Association (ABA) accreditation. During Shea's tenure as dean, some began to call Buffalo Law School \\"Little Harvard.\\" In 1939, Shea was recruited by his friend from western New York State, then Solicitor General of the United States (and later U.S. Attorney General and then U.S. Supreme Court justice) Robert H. Jackson, to join the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Shea was nominated by Roosevelt and confirmed by the Senate to serve as Assistant Attorney General heading the Claims Division (today the Civil Division) in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). He served for six years, running the Division and personally arguing over 50 cases in the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal appellate courts. His Supreme Court cases included Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company v. United States (1943), regarding patents in radio broadcasting, and Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas (1944), a landmark regarding government rate-setting. In spring 1945, Shea joined the staff of his friend Justice Robert H. Jackson, who President Truman had appointed to prosecute captured Nazi leaders for committing war crimes. During summer 1945, Shea worked as one of Justice Jackson's chief assistants in Washington and then in London, where the U.S. and allied nations negotiated the creation of the International Military Tribunal (IMT). That fall, Shea and all of the Jackson staff relocated to Nuremberg in the U.S. military occupation zone of the surrendered former Nazi Germany. Shea and staff assembled evidence and prepared cases, primarily regarding Nazi economic measures that had supported the Nazi Party and state, for trial before the IMT. In October, Shea was the United States representative who presented to the IMT in Berlin the indictment of the defendants who then were prosecuted in Nuremberg. Shea left Jackson's staff before the international Nuremberg trial began in November 1945. In fall 1946, Shea returned to Nuremberg and was present with Jackson when the IMT rendered its judgments on September 30 and October 1. In 1947, Shea and Warner W. Gardner, a fellow lawyer in DOJ during the 1930s and early 1940s, founded what became a leading Washington law firm, Shea & Gardner. Shea had an active litigation and regulatory practice there until his death in 1989, of lung cancer, in Alexandria, Virginia. Personal life Francis Shea was married to attorney Hilda Droshnicopp Shea (June 22, 1910 ‚Äì January 13, 2009). They were parents of a son, Richard.  References  *Francis M.

It became an important posting inn under landlord Richard Ballard, who was Mayor of Monmouth in 1675 and also postmaster.Kissack K. (2003) Monmouth and its Buildings. Logaston Press An ardent Royalist, he claimed the visit by Charles I, and issued brass tokens bearing the head of Charles II with the inscription \\"God Preserve our Gracious King\\". Charles I was reputed to have visited it in 1645, during a stay at Raglan Castle, and the Royalist landlord subsequently erected a plaster bas-relief of Charles in 1673, still to be seen above the fireplace in the left-hand Bar.Bust of \\"Charles I\\" in the barThough it is not clear whether this is Charles I or Charles II, or an amalgam of both, or perhaps just a generic monarch. since it is not particularly realistic. In 1820, William Cobbett, the pamphleteer spoke at the hotel.Notice within the main bar, viewed March 2012 Cobbett had just stood unsuccessfully as M.P. for Coventry. He was noted for his opposition to paper money and the corn laws and his enthusiasm for parliamentary reform and the rural Englishmen. In 1835 there were 15 inns and pubs in Agincourt Square, giving rise to the rhyme \\"A gin court here, a gin court there, no wonder they call it A-gin-court Square\\"Hurley Heather (2007) The pubs of Monmouth, Chepstow and the Wye Valley. Logaston Press Monmouth Cricket Club shirt in the hotel with a QRpedia code. However, the King's Head Hotel was hardly a gin court, being Monmouth Borough's pre-eminent hostelry until the construction of The Beaufort Arms Hotel on the other side of the Shire Hall. Regular stagecoach services left for Ross, Gloucester, Cheltenham, Oxford and London: even then London was only eighteen hours away. When the railways came to Gloucester in 1840, coach services left the Agincourt Square hotels and reached Gloucester in three hours. Through fares to London at that time were 14s (shillings) 7 d (pence). The railways finally reached Monmouth itself in 1857, to Newport, and in 1873 to Ross and 1875 to Coleford, finally killing off the stagecoach services. In 1840 the hotel had 18 bedrooms, and kept 16 coach horses and several coaches. It caught fire in 1870, but survived in essentially its present form.King's Head ca1900 By the start of the 20th century the hotel still offered posting and livery stables, but also facilities for cycling and motor cars. The large dining area, with its high ceilings, still has some of the grandeur associated with its past, and the hotel still offers rooms on a bed and breakfast basis. Now, however, and much more mundanely, buses leave from the bus station at the bottom of Monnow Street. In 2011, the Kings Head (J D Westherspoons) sponsored the local cricket club. There is a framed shirt on the wall and the club holds its monthly meetings at the pub. Like dozens of other objects in the pub the cricket team's display is accompanied by a QRpedia code which allows visitors to obtain information on the club in their own language. These were installed in 2012 as part of the \\"MonmouthpediA\\" project which provides visitors with information about all aspects of the town.Wikipedia project to cover life in Monmouth, BBC News, 30 December 2011 References External links *Homepage at JD Wetherspoon Hotels in Monmouth History of Monmouthshire Grade II* listed buildings in Monmouthshire Grade II* listed hotels ","title":"Kings Head Hotel, Monmouth"},{"id":"34058156","text":"William Master was a politician.

Major characters * The Flash ‚Äì Barry Allen is the main character of Flashpoint and is one of the few characters who remembers the original timeline. Despite being from the original timeline, Barry's personal history is different: Barry initially does not have his super-speed or his secret identity as the Flash; his mother is alive and; he has no relationship with Iris West. Despite having memories from the initial timeline, Barry's memories change sporadically throughout the series, causing him to recall the events of the Flashpoint timeline such as Aquaman's flooding of Europe and Wonder Woman's conquest of England. With the aid of Batman, Barry manages to convince various heroes and villains to collaborate in stopping Aquaman and Wonder Woman from escalating their conflict into a world war. However, during the heroes' final assault on the Amazonian kingdom, Barry's efforts are almost proven futile, as Professor Zoom appears in the wake of the battle, taunting him due to his inability to prevent Zoom's manipulations from taking effect. Thawne then reveals to the Flash that the entire Flashpoint timeline is actually the result of Barry's attempt to prevent Zoom from murdering his mother, and that Zoom now has the ability to kill the Flash at his own leisure without negating his own existence. After learning his inadvertent role in the creation of the Flashpoint timeline, Barry tries to set things right by trying to stop his younger self from changing history. However, the cursed immortal Pandora takes advantage of the situations and creates another alternate timeline slightly different from the original, and Barry fails to realize it. * Reverse-Flash ‚Äì Professor Eobard \\"Zoom\\" Thawne, the Reverse-Flash, serves as a red herring of the Flashpoint timeline, and, unlike Barry, the Reverse-Flash still has his powers at their fullest. Eobard constantly toys with Barry by speaking to Barry's mother while running at super-speed and replacing the costume inside the Flash's ring with a Reverse-Flash costume. He is revealed to have caused tragedy in Barry's life after realizing that preventing Barry from becoming the Flash would wipe out his own existence. In the penultimate issue, Reverse-Flash appears before the Flash during the battle between the Amazons and the Atlanteans. He then reveals to Barry that the Flashpoint timeline was actually created by Barry himself, after he traveled back in time to stop Eobard from killing his mother. According to Zoom, these actions transformed him into a living paradox, no longer requiring Barry to exist, and allowing him to kill the Flash without erasing his own existence. Zoom continues to taunt Barry with this knowledge until he is stabbed in the back by an Amazonian sword and killed by Batman. He later returns as an alternate timeline version, before his pre-Flashpoint memories are restored. * Booster Gold ‚Äì When Earth and the rest of the universe entered into an alternate timeline as the result of the feud between the Flash and the Reverse-Flash, Booster Gold and Skeets awaken and are the only ones who remember the original timeline. Booster Gold travels to Coast City, but the U.S. soldiers attack him mistaking him to be an Atlantean threat. Skeets is damaged when Booster Gold is attacked by the military's Project Six, which is revealed to be Doomsday.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #44 (May 2011) During the battle in Coast City, Booster Gold discovers that Doomsday is controlled by General Nathaniel Adam. Booster Gold then escapes from Doomsday and then saves a woman named Alexandra Gianopoulos from Doomsday's attack. Booster Gold learns the timeline has been changed, suspecting that Eobard Thawne was behind it. Alexandra and Booster Gold split up, but she secretly has powers allowing her to take others' powers and follows him. Later, Booster Gold flies to Gotham City when Doomsday attacks him. General Adam's control link is destroyed by Alexandra in an attempt to rescue Booster Gold.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #45 (June 2011) During the fight, Doomsday beats Booster Gold nearly to death, but he is rescued by Alexandra. Booster Gold tries to prevent Doomsday from killing innocent people, and manages to put Doomsday's helmet back on. Doomsday's control is restored to General Adam, who grabs Booster, hoping to kill him.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #46 (July 2011) Fortunately, General Adam takes Booster Gold back to the base for interrogation, allowing Booster Gold to escape when the sight of \\"Project Superman\\" causes Doomsday's true personality to resurface again. Alexandra manages to defeat Doomsday by using the control helmet to make Doomsday tear himself apart, subsequently asking Booster Gold to take her with him when he restores history to normal. However, Alexandra subsequently sacrifices herself to save Booster Gold from an Atlantean attack, leaving Booster Gold to return to the Vanishing Point as history resets itself without any clear memory of his time in the Flashpoint universe.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #47 (August 2011) * Kid Flash ‚Äì Bart Allen wakes up in the 31st century in Brainiac's stasis pod chamber without his super-speed. After failing to avoid being recaptured by Brainiac, he is confronted by a female Hot Pursuit and escapes with her help. Hot Pursuit reveals herself to be Patty Spivot, Barry Allen's assistant.Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost #1 (June 2011) Kid Flash learns that Patty stole Hot Pursuit's motorcycle and has taken his place. Bart allows himself to be recaptured by Brainiac and is placed into a statis pod, destroying Brainiac's security program from the inside. Patty holds off Brainiac and breaks an energy projector, which returns Bart's super-speed to him. Bart then runs through time to the 21st century, and promises Patty that he will return and rescue her.Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost #2 (July 2011) However, Bart's body transforms into the Black Flash, causing him to kill the speedsters Max Mercury, Jay Garrick, and Wally West. Bart reverts from the Black Flash and meets Barry, where he realizes that the Speed Force is encased in him. Bart is transformed into the living embodiment of the Speed Force's light, or the \\"White Flash\\", and he gives Barry his power and tells him to save the world.Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost #3 (August 2011) Heroes * Abin Sur ‚Äì As the \\"Blackest Night\\" falls across the universe, Abin Sur, or Green Lantern of Sector 2814, is dispatched to Earth by the Guardians of the Universe with the mission to retrieve the White Entity and bring it back to Oa.Flashpoint: Abin Sur ‚Äì The Green Lantern #1 (June 2011) While reaching planet Earth, Abin Sur's ship is damaged by a laser that he is forced to crash on the land.Flashpoint: Hal Jordan #1 (June 2011) Survived, he is approached by Hal Jordan, but he is subsequently taken into custody by Cyborg and the U.S. government to be questioned about his reasons for being on Earth.Flashpoint: Abin Sur ‚Äì The Green Lantern #2 (July 2011) Although he initially agrees to work with the Earth's heroes to deal with the Amazon/Atlantean War, he declines later on when Batman refuses to join. He is attacked by Sinestro, who reveals that he has learned of the prophecy of the Flashpoint as well as the original world that existed before this one. Sinestro plans to use the Flash to change the history to his own liking and cuts off Abin Sur's hand, severing his connection with his ring. The ring then flies onto Abin Sur's other hand, and he manages to defeat and imprison Sinestro. The Guardians then contact Abin Sur, demanding that he bring the Entity to them, yet refusing to listen to Sinestro's talk of the Flashpoint. They discharge Abin Sur from the Corps, telling him that his ring will find a new wielder when it runs out of power. Abin joins the battle in Europe when a cataclysmic earthquake starts. He dives into the crevice just before his ring runs out of power. The Entity then bonds with Abin Sur and he sees a vision of his sister telling him to truly experience life rather than just living it. Abin Sur is then given the power of the White Lantern and flies into space where he attempts to heal the damage done to the Earth.Flashpoint: Abin Sur ‚Äì The Green Lantern #3 (August 2011) * Batman ‚Äì Thomas Wayne is the Batman of the Flashpoint reality. Having long abandoned practicing medicine, Thomas Wayne runs Wayne Casinos and has taken up the identity of Batman. On the other hand, Batman in the Flashpoint timeline is an unhinged vigilante who dispenses murderous justice on the streets of Gotham and works out of an underequiped Batcave under the decaying ruins of Wayne Manor. He also has the gun that Joe Chill used to shoot his son as a trophy, indicating that Wayne had gotten his revenge on Bruce Wayne's murder. Wayne has brought gambling into Gotham as a means of controlling and strategically eliminating crime within the city, and he is also seen working with Oswald Cobblepot. Subsequently, he has killed the Flashpoint versions of Killer Croc, Hush, Poison Ivy, and Scarecrow.Flashpoint: Batman ‚Äì Knight of Vengeance #1 (June 2011) With Bruce Wayne dying in his and his wife's place, Thomas becomes the Batman. Judge Harvey Dent asks Thomas to save his children, who have been kidnapped by the Joker. Thomas later meets Barry Allen and learns that as a result of the Reverse-Flash's manipulations, an alternate timeline was created. Upon finding out that Bruce originally survived the mugging instead of him and his wife, Batman allies himself with Barry in a quest to search and defeat Zoom to restore the timeline and bring his son back to life, regardless the cost of his own. While Allen is recovering in the Batcave after the first attempt to restore his speed, Thomas resumes locating the Joker with Police Chief James Gordon. Later, Batman sees the footage of the Joker murdering Gordon and confronts the Joker in Wayne Manor, revealing her to be his wife Martha.Flashpoint: Batman ‚Äì Knight of Vengeance #2 (July 2011) It is revealed that after Bruce's death, Martha disfigured her face after being driven mad by the loss of her child. Later on, Batman resumes in pursuing his wife after he successfully saves one of Dent's children. In the final battle, Batman reveals of what he has learned from the Flash to the Joker; that he and his wife were supposed to die that night at Crime Alley and how they are alive now. Thomas promises her that he would do everything it takes just to bring their son back to life. When Martha asks her husband of what Bruce was like after they have died, Thomas reluctantly reveals that their son would become Batman. Knowing the sufferings her son would endure after their deaths puts Martha further into madness, and she falls to her demise in the Batcave.Flashpoint: Batman ‚Äì Knight of Vengeance #3 (August 2011) Batman later aids Barry Allen in his attempt to lead the world's remaining heroes and villains in preventing the Amazons and Atlanteans from starting a world war. In the climax of the series, Batman manages to kill Professor Zoom by stabbing him with an Amazonian sword. Before the Flash runs to stop his younger self from altering the timeline, Thomas thanks him for all he has done and gives Barry a letter addressed to his son. After the timeline had reset, Bruce Wayne placed his father's letter in a display case at the Batcave after reading it.Justice League (vol. 2) #9 (May 2012) * Captain Thunder ‚Äì The Marvel Family of the Flashpoint timeline consists of six children who were caught on a subway car that took them to the Rock of Eternity. As a result, each of the youths were given a different one of the wizard's attributes, and go by the name \\"S!H!A!Z!A!M!\\". The six children possess the collective ability to turn into Captain Thunder, this timeline's version of Captain Marvel. While the children are in their foster home in Fawcett City, they are approached by Cyborg, Flash, Batman, Enchantress, and Element Woman. Billy is swayed to the heroes' cause since he is able to use his abilities to sift through the Flash's memories and see himself as Captain Marvel back in the proper, more heroic universe.

He was the eldest son of Rudolf Ferdinand of Lippe-Sternberg- Schwalenberg (17 March 1671 - 12 July 1736) and Louise Juliane of Kunowitz (21 August 1671 - 21 October 1754) and the grandson of Jobst Herman of Lippe- Biesterfeld.  Life  Biesterfeld estate in 1764 Charles Frederick Augustus was the last Lord of Biesterfeld. During his reign, he had the manor's brewery moved from Schwalenberg to Biestereld and added a distillery, investing 6000 taler in this endeavour. In 1763, he constructed a hunting lodge in the Sachsenwald forest, near Hamburg, named Friedrichsruh after himself. The nearby village was later renamed after the hunting lodge.Hanswilhelm Haefs: Ortsnamen und Ortsgeschichten in Schleswig-Holstein: zunebst dem reichhaltigen slawischen Ortsnamenmaterial und den d√§nischen Einfl√ºssen auf Fehmarn und Lauenburg, Helgoland und Nordfriesland.

Many factors including cyclins, cyclin- dependent kinases (CDKs), ubiquitin ligases, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases, and reversible phosphorylations regulate mitotic exit to ensure that cell cycle events occur in correct order with fewest errors. The end of mitosis is characterized by spindle breakdown, shortened kinetochore microtubules, and pronounced outgrowth of astral (non-kinetochore) microtubules. For a normal eukaryotic cell, mitotic exit is irreversible. Proteolytic degradation Fig. 1 Immunofluorescence patterns of cyclin B and phosphorylated cyclin-dependent kinase1 (Cdk1) in HeLa cells change as they go from G2 to anaphase. Many speculations were made with regard to the control mechanisms employed by a cell to promote the irreversibility of mitotic exit in a eukaryotic model organism, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Proteolytic degradation of cell cycle regulators and corresponding effects on the levels of cyclin-dependent kinases were proposed as a mechanism that promotes eukaryotic cell cycle and metaphase-to-anaphase transition in particular. In this theory, anaphase promoting complex (APC), a class of ubiquitin ligase, facilitates degradation of mitotic cyclins (Clb2) and anaphase-inhibiting factors (PDS1, CUT2) to promote mitotic exit. APC ubiquitinates nine-amino acid motif known as the destruction box (D box) in the NH2-terminal domain of mitotic cyclins for degradation by proteasome. APC in association with Cdc20 (APC-Cdc20) ubiquitinates and targets mitotic cyclins (Clb2) for degradation at initial phase. Simultaneously, APC-Cdc20 mediates degradation of securins, which inhibit separases through binding, at anaphase onset. Released and active separase cleaves cohesin that held sister chromatids together, facilitating separation of sister chromatids and initiates mitotic exit by promoting release of Cdc14 from nucleolus. At later phase, downregulation of Cdk1 and activation of Cdc14, a Cdh1-activating phosphatase, promotes formation of APC in association with Cdh1 (APC-Cdh1) to degrade Clb2s. Cdc20 and Cdh1, which are the activators of APC, recruit substrates such as securin and B-type cyclins(Clb) for ubiquitination. Without Cdk1-Clb2 complexes to phosphorylate proteins that are involved in spindle dynamics such as Sli15, Ase1, and Ask1, spindle elongation and chromosomal segregation are promoted, facilitating mitotic exit. The importance of proteolytic degradation in eukaryotic cell cycle changed the view of cell division as a simple kinase cascade to a more complex process in which interactions among phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteolysis are necessary. However, experiments using budding yeast cells with cdc28-as1, an INM-PP1 (ATP analog)-sensitive Cdk allele, proved that destruction of B-type cyclins (Clb) is not necessary for triggering irreversible mitotic exit. Clb2 degradation did shorten the Cdk1-inhibition period required for triggering irreversible mitotic exit indicating that cyclin proteolysis contributes to the dynamic nature of the eukaryotic cell cycle due to slower timescale of its action but is unlikely to be the major determining factor in triggering irreversible cell cycle transitions. Sic1 levels Discoveries were made which indicated the importance of the level of the inhibitors of cyclin- dependent kinases in regulating eukaryotic cell cycle. In particular, the level of Sic1, a stoichiometric inhibitor of Clb-CDK complexes in budding yeast, was shown to be particularly important in irreversible G1-S transition by irreversibly activating S phase kinases. Sic1 level was shown to play a major role in triggering irreversible mitotic exit (M-G1 transition) as well as in G1-S transition. During mitosis, decreasing levels of Cdk1 leads to the activation of Cdc14, a phosphatase that counteracts Cdk1 via activation of Cdh1 and Swi5, a transcriptional activator of Sic1 proteins. While degradation of Sic1 to a certain low level triggered the onset of S phase, accumulation of Sic1 to a certain high level was required to trigger irreversible mitotic exit. Cdk1-inhibitors could induce mitotic exit even when degradation of B-type cyclins was blocked by expression of non-degradable Clbs or proteasome inhibitors. However, sister chromatids failed to segregate, and cells reverted to mitosis once the inhibitors were washed away, indicating that a threshold level of the inhibitors needs to be achieved to trigger irreversible mitotic exit independently of cyclin degradations. Despite different thresholds of Sic1 level that are required to trigger mitotic exit compared to G1-S transition, the level of Sic1 was shown to play a key role in regulating eukaryotic cell cycle by inhibiting the activity of CDKs. Dynamical systems approach Fig. 1 Irreversible and bistable switch in mitotic exit with control parameter being Sic1 level and order parameter being cell cycle phases. Because eukaryotic cell cycle involves a variety of proteins and regulatory interactions, dynamical systems approach can be taken to simplify a complex biological circuit into a general framework for better analysis. Among the four possible input/output relationships, the relationship between Sic1 level and mitotic exit seems to show the characteristics of an irreversible bistable switch, driven by feedback between APC-Cdh1, Sic1, and Clb2-Cdk1. Bistability is known to control biological functions such as cell cycle control and cellular differentiation and play a key role in many cellular regulatory networks. Bistable input/output relationship is characterized by two stable states with two bifurcation points. Multiple outputs are possible for one specific input in the region of bistability, marked by two bifurcation points. In addition, the bistable relationship displays hysteresis: the final state/output depends on the history of the input as well as the current value of input because the system has a memory. One bifurcation point has a negative control parameter value (the bifurcation point is on the other side of the axis), resulting in disconnection between the two stable states and irreversibility of the transition from one state to the other. With regard to mitotic exit, the two stable states are defined by mitosis and G1 phase. Once Sic1 level (input) accumulates beyond the threshold, irreversible transition occurs from mitosis (stable state I) to G1 phase (stable state II). In the imperfect environment, the only bifurcation that remains intact is saddle-node bifurcation. Saddle-node bifurcation does not break down (saddle-node is the expected generic behavior), while transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations break down in the presence of imperfections. Thus, the only one-dimensional bifurcation that can exist in imperfect biological world is the saddle-node bifurcation. The bistable relation between M-G1 transition and Sic1 level can be represented as a diagram of two saddle-node bifurcations in which the system's behavior changes qualitatively with a small change in control parameter, the amount of Sic1. Systems-level feedback Fig. 2 Simplified network involving Cdk1-Clb2, APC-Cdh1, Sic1, and Cdc14. Double negative feedback loop, mediated by APC-Cdh1 and Sic1, is required to suppress Cdk1-Clb2 and trigger mitotic exit. Because the behavior of cell cycle critically depends on the amount of Sic1 at the M-G1 transition state, the amount of Sic1 is tightly regulated by systems-level feedbacks. Because Cdk1-Clb2 inhibits Sic1 by phosphorylating Sic1 and making Sic1 available for degradation via ubiquitylation, APC-Cdh1-dependent degradation of Cdk1-Clb2 not only decreases the level of available Cdk1-Clb2 complexes but also increases the level of Sic1 which in turn further inhibits the function of Cdk1-Clb2. This activation of the double negative feedback loop is initiated from APC-Cdc20-dependent degradation of Cdk1-Clb2 and release of Cdc14 from nucleolar protein Net1/Cfi1. FEAR (Cdc14 early anaphase release) pathway facilitates Clb2-Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 which transiently releases Cdc14 from Net1. The released Cdc14 and Clb2-Cdk1 complexes go onto form spindles that activates mitotic exit network (MEN). MEN allows sustained release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, and Cdc14 counters the activity of Clb2-Cdk1 by activating Cdh1 and stabilizing Sic1 through activation of Sic1-transcriptional activator Swi5. Sic1 positively regulates itself by inhibiting Cdk1-Clb2 to release inhibition of Swi5, and Cdh1 also positively regulates itself by inhibiting Clb2-Cdk1 to release inhibition of MEN which can activate Cdc14 and subsequently Cdh1 itself. The double-negative feedback loop, formed by APC-Cdh1 and Sic1, is required to maintain low Clb2-Cdk1 activity because Clb2 auto-activates its synthesis by activating transcriptional factors, Fkh2‚ÄìMcm1 Ndd1 complex. Implications Eukaryotic cell cycle consists of various checkpoints and feedback loops to ensure faithful and successful cell division. During mitosis for example, when duplicated chromosomes are improperly attached to mitotic spindle, spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins including Mad and Bub inhibit APC-Cdc20 to delay entry into anaphase and B-type cyclin degradations. In addition, when mitotic spindles are misaligned, MEN and subsequently Cdc14 are inhibited in a Bub2 and Bfa1-dependent manner to prevent degradation of mitotic cyclins and anaphase entry. Sic1 is a nice example demonstrating how systems-level feedbacks interact to sense the environmental conditions and trigger cell cycle transitions. Even though actual M-G1 transition is vastly complex with numerous proteins and regulations involved, dynamical systems approach allows simplification of this complex system into bistable input/output relation with two saddle-node bifurcations in which the output (mitotic exit) depends on critical concentration of Sic1. Using one-dimensional analysis, it might be possible to explain many of the irreversible transition points in the eukaryotic cell cycle that are governed by systems-level control and feedback. Other examples of irreversible transition points include Start (irreversible commitment to a new cell division cycle) that can be explained by irreversible bistable switch whose control parameter is tightly regulated by the systemic feedbacks involving Cln2, Whi5, and SBF.

Dawson is best remembered as an active participant in three of the greatest textile strikes of the 1920s; the 1926 Passaic textile strike, the 1928 New Bedford textile strike, and the 1929 Loray Mill strike in Gastonia, North Carolina. An activist in the Communist Party USA during the 1920s, Dawson was the first woman ever elected to a leadership position in an American textile union. Biography Early years Ellen Dawson was born on December 14, 1900 in Barrhead, a small industrial town of about 9,000 residents on the outskirts of Glasgow, Scotland.David Lee McMullen, Strike! The Radical Insurrections of Ellen Dawson. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2010; pg. 3 She was the fifth of at least 10 children born to Annie Halford Dawson and Patrick Dawson, a poor working class couple. Her paternal grandparents were indigenous Scots, while her maternal grandparents were Irish emigrants, having left Ireland in the 1840s to escape the Great Famine. At the time of her birth, Dawson's father worked as an iron foundry worker at Shanks' Tubal Works - a manufacturer of toilets and other bathroom products - in Barrhead.McMullen, Strike! pp. 7-8. The work was gruelling and pay was based on the piece work system.McMullen, Strike! pp. 14-15. Her mother was a former power loom weaver in a textile mill.McMullen, Strike! pg. 29. During the 18th century, Barrhead had been the center of an Owenite utopian cooperative movement ‚Äî an organization which around the time of Dawson's birth operated 19 businesses and included some 2,100 members ‚Äî nearly a quarter of the entire community.McMullen, Strike! pg. 23. While no membership records of the Barrhead Cooperative Society are known to exist, and consequently there is no way to either confirm or deny that the Dawson family were members, Dawson's biographer recounts family oral history indicating that they were members of the organization. This would have been an important formative experience in Dawson's life, it is intimated, as the Cooperative was linked to social and educational efforts directed at the children of the community.See Dawson, Strike! pp. 23-27 for a discussion of the cooperative movement in Barrhead. Scottish years Dawson started work in 1914, probably working in a textile mill as had her mother before her. Although the date of her first employment is known, the exact location and the tasks she performed are not recorded.McMullen, Strike! pg. 28. While this, with other aspects of Dawson's early years, has been poorly recorded, the political and social environment of so-called Red Clydeside ‚Äî the region in which she was raised ‚Äî is a subject of considerable academic research.See, for example William Kenefick and Arthur McIvor (eds.), Roots of Red Clydeside, 1910-1914? Labour Unrest and Industrial Relations in West Scotland. Edinburgh: John Donald, 1996; Robert Keith Middlemas, The Clydesiders: A Left Wing Struggle for Parliamentary Power. London: Hutchinson, 1965; William Kenefick, Red Scotland! The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872 to 1932. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007; etc. Historian David Lee McMullen sees this environmental factor as a fundamental component in the understanding of Ellen Dawson: > \\"Given what we know about Dawson's activities in the United States during > the late 1920s ‚Äî where she was a highly effective labor organizer, known for > her courage on the picket line and her fiery oratory ‚Äî Red Clydeside must > have been Dawson's classroom and the activists of the period her teacher. > During these years she was introduced to the realities of industrial wage > labor, and began formulating her own attitudes and opinions as a worker. > During this time Scottish women emerged not only as rank-and-file workers, > but as leaders within several major labor confrontation.... Dawson may have > only been a silent witness to these events, but it seems impossible to > believe that she, or any other young worker of the period, could have > escaped the influence of such firebrand rhetoric and monumental events.\\" The end of World War I brought large-scale unemployment to Glasgow and other manufacturing cities of the United Kingdom, as wartime spending was curtailed.McMullen, Strike! pg. 51. Late in 1919, the Dawson family including Ellen, left the Clyde area in search of employment, heading south to Lancashire, England.McMullen, Strike! pg. 49. The family settled in the village of Millgate, about 15 miles north of Manchester.McMullen, Strike! pg. 53. Dawson found work as a spinner and a weaver in local textile mills, remaining in this capacity until April, 1921.McMullen, Strike! pg. 57. The unemployment situation in Lancashire proved little better than that of west Scotland, and on April 30, 1921, the 20-year-old Dawson and an older brother departed for the prospect of better opportunities in the United States.McMullen, Strike! pg. 59. They travelled as steerage passengers aboard the SS Cedric, arriving in New York City on May 9, 1921.McMullen, Strike! pp. 59-60. Labor organizer in America Soon joined by other family members, the Dawson family settled in the mill town of Passaic, New Jersey, making a home in a working-class neighborhood composed largely of European emigrants, a few blocks from the Botany Worsted Mills.McMullen, Strike! pg. 69. For the next five years, Dawson worked at the Botany Mill, a facility in which over 70 percent of the workers earned less than $1200 annually, at a time when it was estimated that $1600 a year was required to support a family.McMullen, Strike! pg. 70, citing the figures of economist W. Jett Lauck given in 1926 Congressional testimony. Death and legacy Dawson died at 4am on April 17, 1967 at her home in Charlotte Harbor, Florida.McMullen, Strike! pg. 182. She was 66 years old. Although the cause of her death will not be released by the state of Florida until 2017, according to family members Dawson had been suffering from \\"a lung complaint contracted during her years working in the mills.\\" Her published obituary in the local press made no mention of her radical past.McMullen, Strike! pg. 183.

The items were deposited together in and under a lead container buried about underground which was found in a field by a metal detectorist. It is believed to date to around AD 900, a time of intense conflict between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danish settlers of northern England. The hoard is one of the largest Viking hoards ever discovered in the UK. It has been purchased by Lancashire Museums Service and has been displayed at Lancaster City Museum and the Museum of Lancashire in Preston. It is particularly significant for its inclusion of a coin stamped with the name of a previously unknown Viking ruler. Discovery Items from the hoard including the lead container The hoard was discovered by local metal detectorist Darren Webster after 20 minutes of detecting in a field that he had previously searched several times before without finding anything more significant than a Tudor half-groat. His wife had given him the detector the previous Christmas as a present, and he was taking a short time off to try his luck before heading to work. When he found the casket he was initially disappointed, as it appeared to be merely a sheet of lead, but when he lifted it he found that it had been shaped into a container from which silver objects spilled out as he raised it. According to Webster, \\"the minute I found [the silver] I knew what it was or had a very good idea what it was.\\" He realised immediately that it was \\"more than likely Viking.\\" The find was reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme's local Finds Liaison Officer and the items were taken to the British Museum for weighing, analysing, cataloguing and cleaning. Items discovered A nested silver bracelet from the hoard, unusual for its combination of Irish, Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian-style decorative elements The hoard consists of a variety of silver items including 27 coins, 10 arm-rings, 2 finger-rings, 14 ingots, 6 brooch fragments, a fine wire braid and 141 fragments of arm-rings and ingots which had been chopped up and turned into hacksilver, which was used as a form of currency in Viking times. Together they weigh a little over two pounds (1 kg). The hoard includes Arabic, Anglo-Saxon, Anglo-Viking and Viking coins. They date to around AD 900 and include coins of Alfred the Great and the Danish-ruled Kingdom of Northumbria. Some of the other items appear to have been intended for personal ornamentation, perhaps to indicate the owner's rank. The arm bands would have been given by a leader to a warrior as a reward for services rendered. One of the bands is particularly notable for its unusual combination of Irish, Anglo- Saxon and Carolingian-style decoration. One coin of a previously unknown design carries the name AIRDECONUT. This appears to be a rendition of the Scandinavian name Harthacnut (\\"tough-knot\\"). The reverse has the letters DNS (Dominus) REX (King) arranged in the form of a cross, indicating a Christian affiliation. Its design is related to coins issued by the Northumbrian Viking rulers Sigfro√∞r and Kn√∫tr, who may have ruled the kingdom jointly between 895 and 905. The name Airdeconut is previously unrecorded and appears to refer to an otherwise unknown Viking ruler. He is believed to be the first newly identified medieval ruler in England in the last fifty years, and the first \\"new\\" Viking king to be identified since 1840. Another important coin is a silver penny of about 900‚Äì902 which is inscribed ALVVALDVS (Alwaldus) on the obverse. This is believed to refer to √Üthelwold, a son of Alfred's elder brother, King √Üthelred I. After Alfred's death in 899, he attempted to claim the throne, and then fled to Northumbria, where he was accepted as a king.Important Viking hoard highlights the continuing success of the Treasure Act and Portable Antiquities Scheme The Portable Antiquities Scheme, press release 14 December 2011, retrieved 16 December 2011 √Üthelwold was killed at the Battle of the Holme in 902. The hoard is the largest Viking treasure found in the UK since the discovery of the Vale of York Hoard in 2007 and is the fourth-largest Viking hoard found in the UK. It has striking similarities with the much larger Cuerdale Hoard, found in 1840 about away. Both hoards are thought to have been buried around AD 900 at a time of conflict between the Viking settlers of northern England and the Anglo-Saxons, whose kings Alfred the Great and Edward the Elder sought to re-establish Anglo-Saxon control over Danish-ruled territory in England. It would have been worth a considerable amount at the time, perhaps the equivalent of a herd of sheep or cattle. The fact that the hoard's owner never returned to claim it may indicate that they did not survive the unrest. Display and disposal Antiquarian Peter Spencer examining coins as part of providing an independent valuation for the hoard. The British Museum displayed a selection of the finds from mid-December 2011 through to the New Year, in conjunction with the launch of the annual reports on the Portable Antiquities Scheme and the Treasure Act 1996. On 16 December 2011 the hoard was determined by a Lancashire coroner to be treasure. The independent Treasure Valuation Committee then carried out an evaluation of the hoard's monetary value and a reward was shared between its finder and the landowner. The Lancaster City Museum expressed an interest in acquiring the hoard if it could raise enough money to purchase it. The hoard was eventually valued at ¬£110,000 and it was reported in May 2013 that Lancaster City Council believed it would be \\"unaffordable\\" to purchase and conserve the hoard in the city, but hoped that Lancashire County Council could acquire it with a financial contribution from the city. In October 2013 it was announced that the hoard had been purchased by Lancashire County Museum Service with the assistance of grants of ¬£45,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and ¬£33,000 from the National Art Fund. It formed the basis of a display \\"The Silverdale Hoard: the Story So Far\\" in Lancaster City Museum from 25 October to 21 December 2013, which attracted record visitor numbers to the museum. It was then moved to the Museum of Lancashire, Preston, being displayed from 15 February to 7 December 2014. It was then to be the subject of further research and conservation work. The Museum of Lancashire closed on 30 September 2016, although remaining open for pre-booked school groups. The hoard was on display in the Harris Museum, Preston, June-August 2019 as part of an exhibition \\"Fearsome Craftsmen\\" displaying Viking craft. In February 2020 plans were announced for a bid to the National Lottery Heritage Fund for ¬£96,000 to support a temporary display of the hoard in Silverdale village library.

She was the daughter of writers Irving Wallace and Sylvia Wallace and the sister of writer and populist historian David Wallechinsky. She was co-author of the bestselling book, The Book of Lists (1977). Career Wallace is best known for her books of lists, with topics that ranged from the rare, curious and unusual to crime and horror. In 1977, she lived in Berkeley on her brother's commune and during school breaks, worked with him and their father on what was to become a #1 bestseller, The Book of Lists. The book ran to three editions. Wallace used the lists format in two other books: The Official Punk Rock Book of Lists with Handsome Dick Manitoba (2007) and The Book of Lists: Horror (2008) co-written with Del Howison and her boyfriend Scott Bradley. She also wrote The Prodigy, a biography of William James Sidis, published in 1986, and an erotic novel, Desire (1990). Personal life In 1990 she entered into a relationship with the famed and reclusive anthropologist Carlos Castaneda, which she wrote about in her memoir, Sorcerer's Apprentice: My Life with Carlos Castaneda, published in 2003. The book was the first to reveal the private life of Castaneda, and detailed his hitherto mysterious \\"inner circle\\" of women who lived with him on a closed compound.Amy Wallace, Sorcerer's Apprentice: My Life with Carlos Castaneda. North Atlantic Books, 2003. In an interview nine months before her death, Amy Wallace said of her father that Irving Wallace was \\"virtually a perfect dad ‚Äì a wonderful, loving man, who did a lot of the things one would expect a mother to do: when I wet the bed at three in the morning when I was little, he uncomplainingly got up and changed them; he cut out my paper dolls; when I had a nightmare he got up with me, no matter what time, to share a cup of tea and talk about it.\\" Of her mother Sylvia, Wallace was less complimentary, \\"My mother was sadistic and for the most part, awful and cruel to my brother and me. She sexually abused me, and verbally abused me constantly, and in public. My father often intervened, but was not always there to do it, and I was too confused to tell him about the sexual interference.\\" She was married for seven years to the musician Josef Marc. She dedicated her biography of William James Sidis titled The Prodigy to him. They divorced amicably in 1986, and he spoke at her funeral. Death She died of a heart condition in August 2013.

Shiraz team (since renamed B.A Shiraz BC) in the Iranian Super League. The documentary was filmed in Iran in the winter of 2008‚Äì2009, a few months before the uprising of Iran's Green Movement. Christiane Amanpour, Gloria Steinem, Maz Jobrani, Karim Sadjadpour, and executive producer Abigail Disney have expressed support for The Iran Job. In December 2011 the film was invited to a private, work-in-progress screening at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. moderated by Karim Sadjadpour. On January 9, 2012 The Iran Job completed a 50-day crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter that raised over $100,000. During its Kickstarter campaign, the film received press coverage from CNN International (on two occasions: a print article on December 23, 2011 and a TV interview that broadcast on January 5, 2012), The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, PBS FRONTLINE's Tehran Bureau, and IFP's Filmmaker magazine. Since the completion of its Kickstarter campaign, the film has received press from PBS' P.O.V. blog. The Iran Job had its world premiere in the Documentary Competition of the Los Angeles Film Festival in June 2012 and it won the award for best documentary entry at the Arlington International Film Festival, Arlington, Massachusetts, in 2013. It has received positive reviews for its humanity and for successfully mixing genres from sports documentary to commentary about social and political climate in Iran, using Kevin's and his friends point of view. After the world premiere, the filmmakers launched a 2nd Kickstarter campaign raising $66,105 for the subsequent self-release of the film. In late 2012, Film Movement acquired the film for North American distribution and as of March, 2014 is available on all digital platforms, including Netflix. In 2013, The Iran Job was short-listed for the Germany Academy Award.

The film was directed by Tim Slade and features Spanish-born choreographer Rafael Bonachela and the Sydney Dance Company. The film was made as Rafael Bonachela began his tenure at the helm of the company, after a period of instability due to the departure of long time Artistic Director Graeme Murphy and the sudden death of Tanja Liedtke, who was about to begin as his successor. The film touches on this transitional period, but structures itself around the chronological creation of the 'We Unfold', as well as around the movements of the musical composition on which it is based, the Symphony No.1 'Oceans' for cello and orchestra by Italian composer Ezio Bosso. Bonachela's strong personality and dynamism is at the heart of the film; and his journey from a small Spanish town, through studies in Spain and London, working with Rambert Dance Company, the singer Kylie Minogue and finally as the leader of his own company is a story marked with conviction and dedication. The film was positively received on its first broadcasts in late 2009 and has screened in Europe, the UK and Australia as well as being commercially available in the United States.

Terence Hodson was to have been a police corruption witness and had rejected requests to enter the Witness Protection Program due to fears for his safety. A former police officer and a hitman were charged with their murders.  Informant  Hodson became a police informant in 2002, after he was arrested by Drug Squad detective David Miechel. Miechel was to become Hodson's handler. On AFL Grand Final weekend in September 2003, Hodson and off-duty Miechel were arrested for burglary on a house in Oakleigh East being used to store approximately $1.3 million in ecstasy pills by criminals and which was soon to be raided by the Drug Squad. Within 48 hours, Hodson's sensitive police file which described the evidence he had given to the Drug Squad as an informant on criminals, was stolen from police headquarters. Hodson agreed to give evidence for Ethical Standards detectives investigating the robbery on his accomplice detective Miechel and implicated Drug Squad detective sergeant Paul Dale. All three were charged in December 2003. Hodson's stolen Drug Squad informant file was leaked and circulated around the Melbourne underworld with Ethical Standard detectives suspecting Dale. Ethical Standard detectives recommended that Hodson and his family enter the Witness Protection Program due to the high risk to his safety. This was declined and they remained in their family home.  Murder  Hodson and his wife were murdered in execution style on May 16, 2004 in their home in Kew, in what The Age described as \\"'horrific' gangland murders\\". Their hands were tied behind their backs and had suffered gunshot wounds to the back of their heads in their lounge room. Christine Hodson is believed to have had no involvement in crime. The charges against Dale for the robbery were dropped after Hodson's murder. The murders sparked calls for a Royal Commission into Victoria Police with the government establishing the Office of Police Integrity (OPI). The murder was investigated by the Homicide Squad despite the Ethical Standards detectives requesting a dedicated task force. The Petra Task Force was created in 2007 to investigate and the OPI in Operation Oboe investigated serving police officers associated with Dale for interfering with the murder investigation. In 2008 authorities offered a $1 million reward for information leading to the solution of the crime. Miechel was jailed in August 2006 for 12 years for the drugs burglary.  Trial  In 2009 Paul Dale was charged with murder of Terrence Hodson and underworld hitman Rodney Charles Collins charged with the double murder. After a significant crown witness in the case Carl Williams died in April 2010 the charges against both men were dropped., Gangland killer Carl Williams died at the high security Barwon Prison after being bashed several times with part of an exercise bike., A former Victoria Police drug squad detective, Paul Dale left court today a free man after a murder charge against him was formally dropped. Mr Dale had been charged with the murder of Terrence Hodson. Hodson had agreed to give evidence against him in a drug case. The prosecution was to allege that Dale paid Williams to arrange the murder of Terrence Hodson and that Carl gave the contract of $150,000 to Rodney Collins. Prominent Melbourne criminal barrister Nicola Gobbo, who had worn a wire to record conversations with Dale at the request of detectives, was to give evidence including that she acted as a courier for Dale. The hitman, killed Terrence's wife not part of contract, and was charged with the double murder. Dale remains a person of interest in the case., Victoria's former police chief Simon Overland says former detective Paul Dale remains a person of interest despite the withdrawal of murder charges against him.

Among his works, he wrote L'histoire des basques and also Histoire g√©n√©rale de la nation basque, where he compares the Basque dialects from France with those of Guip√∫zcoa and √Ålava. Bela family The Bela house, in Maul√©on-Licharre The first known reference to a member of this family from Soule is a text dating to the 15th century which mentions Garzia Belaz de Medrano, a noble from Navarre. His grandson, G√©rard de Bela (1550‚Äì1633), was a bailiff and lieutenant general serving under Jean de Belzunce, Captain-ch√¢telain and Governor of Soule. Apart from Bela, this family used derivative surnames such as Belaspect, Belapeyre, Belagrace, Bela- Ch√©raute and Belap√©ritz. Athanasius of Belapeyre, the son of the Protestant Jacques de Bela and among the family's more prominent members, became a Catholic priest and ascended to the office of vicar general. Among his properties were the mill of Ascon√©guy and the Planterose House in Maul√©on. The mill still has the coat of arms of the family, dated 1767, on the lintel of its entrance. Life At the age of 18, Bela moved to Grenoble in search of adventure, and joined the French army as an artilleryman. He soon reached the rank of cadet, but after a perceived slight by the captain of his regiment, Bela challenged him to a duel and was subsequently imprisoned, but he managed to escape and fled to Germany, where he joined the bodyguard of King Augustus III of Saxony. He then proceeded to Sweden. In this country he worked for their army as a Lieutenant and engineer. His love of drawing and mathematics led him to design fortifications of some importance. During the war of Polish succession, he was sent with the troops of a regiment of Dragoons and joined the defenders for Polish sovereignty. Being Captain of Dragoons he tried to defend the city of Dantzig, although he was made prisoner. Shortly after Bela managed to escape and retired to his homeland, having received a diploma of appreciation from the Polish King, naming him captain of his Royal Guard. Thanks to this feat, Bela was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of Dragoons and distinguished himself during the siege of Metz (1734). After a period in peace, he fought in Bohemia along the Marshal of France, and then also in Flanders and Germany. In 1745 as Lieutenant Colonel and when he had 36 years old, King Louis XV, assigned the formation of an army made up exclusively by Basques, which runs through the mountains and brings together a regiment of one thousand forty-six men, who are usually engaged in the conquest of mountainous terrain. His badge was a blue flag with the cross of St. Andrew in silver and the arms of the Kingdom of Navarre in the Center., the famous \\"Volontaires Cantabres\\", in which Bela was Colonel. The Cantabre regiment was disbanded in 1749. Later Bela challenged to a duel to an individual who was accused of embezzlement of funds from this body. He had a trial before the Court marshals of France sentenced him to six months of imprisonment, while his accuser had to retract. For this reason, Bela left the military career and devoted himself to historical research, to write his military memoirs, to defend lawsuits, to play various public offices with special zeal, in short, to deploy a large activity. In 1748 he published his Exercices et Evolutions √† l'usage du r√©giment Royal Cantabres. A man of great erudition as evidenced by the large number of manuscripts, titles, memories and much documentation which remain, as well as a history of the Basques from their origin to 1748, to which he dedicated 30 years of work, and it is divided into 12 books comprising the history of the seven Basque provinces more a dictionary of Basque dialects with the equivalent words in Hebrew, Greek, Celtic, arm√≥rico, Arabic, Latin gothic, Spanish and Italian. Bela encountered difficulties to print their work and was to deliver to the Benedictine Dom Sanad√≥n - which would later be constitutional Bishop of the diocese. This extract√≥ the work under the title Essai sur the noblesse des Basques, edited in Pau in 1785. Part of the manuscript of Bela was published by Cl√©ment Simon.La Soci√©t√© b√©arnaise au XVIII ¬∞ si√©cle Baron Laussat, published by Lespy, p. 22 Sanadon extract was translated into Spanish by Diego de Lazcano and published in Toulouse in 1786. Another translation was made by Jos√© Gironde, which released his version in 1858. The originals are in the National Library of Paris. Their military memoirs were published by Chaho in Ariel (1846) and by Ducer√© in 1896, with a biography of the author by j. of Jaurgain. Bring by his interest in the material progress of their fellow citizens, he translated into Basque works on Agriculture and economics, the quartermaster on duty refused to publish at the public expense. He also tried by various means obtain a small monopoly of wool knits for Maule√≥n, but their proposals were denied him by the Mayor; Workshop manufacture organized worked until four years before his death. Bela, as a member of the noble estate he was directly involved in the noble plot that led to the expulsion of members of the third estate in 1770. Later, in January 1774, acquired real rights over a large part of Zuberoa - Laruns, Mendibieu, Berrogain, Arrast, Larrory, Larrebieu, Moncayolle, H√¥pital- Saint-Blaise, Sainte-Engr√¢ce and Larrau-whose inhabitants ordered to recognize their manorial rights of hunting, rents, honours, etc., which succeeded for a couple of years until that alienation was overturned by the States. Come the revolution, Bela was stripped of more than half of his fortune, though it seems to be annoyed personally and not emigrated. His habit of greatness took him to invent a false pedigree, which was closely related with the nobles Belaz de Medrano, for whose descendants signed a testament on March 1, 1793.

The name is taken from the name of the street that runs from Enqalab to Bahar-e-Shirazi.  History  Formed in the 1920s, Bahar is home to a multicultural cross-section of Tehran society, including large numbers of Azerbaijanis, Iranian Turks, Assyrians and Armenians; this ethnic blend remains an integral part of the area's cultural fabric. Before the Iranian Revolution the area was considered an upper-middle class part of Tehran. However, during the revolution the area saw many purges of property seized by the revolutionary forces. In more recent times, Bahar has become one of the favored central areas of the city, with close access to Haft-e-Tir metro station.  Modern Day  Over the past twenty years Bahar's population has increased five times its original plan, partly due to the destroying of its original villas. The original properties are mostly in minority now with modern apartment blocks housing at least five apartments becoming the norm. In the past decade Bahar has also seen an increase in commercial activity, with two small malls opening along the main street. It has also seen a drastic shift in the makeup of its commercial properties with many of the original store making way for more food outlets and children's clothing stores.  Urban planning  The area changed and became a part of urban Tehran in the 1940s, when the original villas were demolished for the development of multi-unit apartment buildings. Many street names in the area were changed multiple times. Many of the streets east of Bahar had been named after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's family. After the Islamic Revolution, street names changed to reflect the losses of the young men who fought in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War.  Traffic  Bahar St, a major thoroughfare in the area, was originally a two-way street, but in recent years was turned into a one-way street. Traffic runs northward in the direction of Haft-e-Tir Square to the west and Bahar-e-Shirazi to the north. As the road is generally narrow by modern Tehran standards, it is often very busy with traffic. Many side roads in the area now come under Tehran Municipality's traffic scheme with cameras and police patrolling the area stopping cars not permitted to enter the area.  Shopping  Bahar Street is home to businesses that include children's clothing shops and plumbing wholesalers towards the south and centre of the area. The north offers a combination of delis, restaurants, cafes, general household shops and pastry shops.  Festivals  The Bahar area promotes both Muslim and Christian festivities. Towards Christmas, Bahar St is home to Armenian shops selling decorations and Christmas trees. During the festival of Nouruz, the shops promote new items for residents to redecorate their homes for the coming of the new year.  Schools and Associations  Bahar hosts Faragiran School, Rostam Armenian School and the Armenian Social Center.  Hospitals  Arad General Hospital, Sajjad Hospital, Iran Shahr, and Tehran 502 Military Hospital are all located in the Bahar area.

Founders include Paul Mikesell (formerly of EMC Isilon) and Sergei Tsarev. Some of its technology tested at customers since 2008. Initially called Sierra during the development phase, at its official announcement in 2010, the product was launched with the product name Clustered Database System (CDS). The company received $10 million in funding from Sequoia Capital, U.S. Venture Partners (USVP), and ATA Ventures in December 2010. Robin Purohit became chief executive in October 2011, and another round of $6.75 million was raised in July 2012. Another round of funding from the original backers of $16.5 million was announced in May 2013, and a round of $10 million in new funding in August 2013 was led by HighBAR Ventures. Purohit was replaced by Mike Azevedo in 2014. A round of over $23 million in debt financing was disclosed in February 2016. On September 20, 2018 it was announced that Clustrix was acquired by MariaDB Corporation. Technology Clustrix supports workloads that involve scaling transactions and real-time analytics. The system is a drop-in replacement for MySQL, and is designed to overcome MySQL scalability issues with a minimum of disruption. It also has built in fault- tolerance features for high availability within a cluster. It has parallel backup and parallel replication among clusters for disaster recovery. Clustrix is a scale-out SQL database management system and part of what are often called the NewSQL database systems (modern relational database management systems), closely following the NoSQL movement./ Google Spanner's most surprising revelation NoSQL is Out and NewSQL is in The product was marketed as a hardware \\"appliance\\" using InfiniBand through about 2014. Clustrix's database was made available as downloadable software and from the Amazon Web Services Marketplace by 2013. The primary competitors like Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL supported online transaction processing and online analytical processing but were not distributed. Clustrix provides a distributed relational, ACID database that scales transactions and support real-time analytics. Other distributed relational databases are columnar (they don't support primary transaction workload) and focus on offline analytics and this includes EMC Greenplum, HP Vertica, Infobright, and Amazon Redshift. Notable players in the primary SQL database space are in-memory. This includes VoltDB and MemSQL, which excel at low-latency transactions, but do not target real- time analytics. NoSQL competitors, like MongoDB are good at handling unstructured data and read heavy workloads, but do not compete in the space for write heavy workloads (no transactions, coarse grained (DB-level) locking, and no SQL features (like joins), so the NewSQL and NoSQL databases are complementary. Query evaluation The Clustrix database operates on a distributed cluster of shared-nothing nodes using a query to data approach. Here nodes typically own a subset of the data. SQL queries are split into query fragments and sent to the nodes that own the data. This enables Clustrix to scale horizontally (scale out) as additional nodes are added. Data distribution The Clustrix database automatically splits and distributes data evenly across nodes with each slice having copies on other nodes.http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs227/slides/checkpointing/clustrix.pdf Uniform data distribution is maintained as nodes are added, removed or if data is inserted unevenly. This automatic data distribution approach removes the need to shard and enables Clustrix to maintain database availability in the face of node loss.http://cattell.net/datastores/Datastores.pdf Performance In a performance test completed by Percona in 2011, a three- node cluster saw about a 73% increase in speed over a similarly equipped single MySQL server running tests with 1024 simultaneous threads. Additional nodes added to the Clustrix cluster provided roughly linear increases in speed.Clustrix Delivers Software-Only Kit to Demo Shard-less MySQL Scaling References External links  Database companies Companies based in San Francisco Companies established in 2006 NewSQL ","title":"Clustrix"},{"id":"34059120","text":"Robert \\"Bob\\" Davies (born 1863) was a Welsh footballer who played as a wing half for Druids in the 1880s and made one appearance for Wales in 1885.

Dr. McLean was also a founder of the Peking Union Medical College. He was instrumental in solving complex social and ethical issues during the era of discrimination and segregation in the United States. A scholarship has been established in his name - the Franklin C. McLean Award. This award is given to medical students of minority background.  Early life  He was born February 29, 1888, in Maroa, Illinois. The son and grandson of physicians, he received a B.S. degree from the University of Chicago in 1907, his M.D. from Rush Medical College in 1910, his M.S. degree in 1912 and his Ph.D. degree in 1915. Among his teachers was Anton Julius Carlson. During graduate studies he interned at Cook County Hospital, studied at the University of Graz as well as Vienna, along with several other responsibilities. While in China, he met a fellow medical doctor named Helen Vincent whom he married in 1923.  Early career  McLean became a professor of pharmacology and materia medica in 1911 at the University of Oregon. He stayed in this position until 1914. He then moved on to assistant resident at the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York. In 1916 the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored his trips to China to found the Peking Union Medical College. He was appointed Director of the college, but did not stay for any length of time until 1920 due to his active army duty during World War I. In 1919 he returned to plan the layout of buildings and medical laboratories that were completed in 1921. McLean resigned his administrative duties in 1920, but remained chairman and professor of medicine until 1923, upon returning to the U.S.  University of Chicago  In 1923 McLean was invited to direct the new medical school envisioned by the University of Chicago and set forth planning, overseeing and raising the funds necessary. The medical school opened in 1927. McLean served as its first vice- chairman of the faculty and the chairman of the Department of Medicine. In 1929 he resigned the department chair so as to assume the title of Director of University Clinics and Assistant to the President in Medical Affairs. In 1932 he was forced to resign, leaving behind all administrative duties. He easily shifted back to his research and continued to make many advancements in medicine. McLean was made Professor Emeritus in 1953, but continued his work, which included publishing. Death McLean died on September 10, 1968, at the former Billings Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.

Popular forms of mass media include television, the Internet, and newspapers.\\"Mass Medium\\", Oxford English Dictionary, online version October 18, 2011 Mass media are specifically intended to reach larger audiences. The term is often divided into two broad categories: that of electronic mass media and that of print mass media. Electronic mass media require their audiences to interact with electronics in order to receive the message. They attempt to recreate or represent a message through moving pictures and/or sound.Lorimer, Rowland and Mark Gasher. (2004). Mass Communication in Canada. Oxford University Press. pp. 24‚Äì25. Four common examples of electronic media used in Canadian society are television, radio, films, and the Internet. Print mass media, on the other hand, refers to any media that is distributed to audiences in a printed form, on paper.Lorimer and Gasher 2004, pp.12‚Äî13 Examples of this include newspapers, printed books, and magazines. The mass media model in Canada is different from the mass media model of the United States as well as the rest of the world. According to John A. Irving, mass media functions differently in Canadian society because of a lack of collective identity; this is in reference to Canada's languages (and related cultures) as well as its proximity to the United States. Irving states that such cultural dualism means that only some of the population responds to the mass media in English, while the other portion remain uninfluenced by English-based media. In terms of the proximity to the United States, he explains that \\"most of the difficulties that threaten the mass media in Canada are the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism.\\"Irving, John A. (1969). Mass Media in Canada. The Ryerson Press. p. 225. Because of the United States' overwhelming influence on Canadian mass media, Canada has not been able to form its own identity in the media. These two factors have slowed down the process of the creation of a Canadian community. Mass media help in forming a community through communication. When a large group of people is in communication with one another through media, an identifiable culture is formed. Individuals in dialectic experience a sense of membership and collective identity.Irving 1969, p. 223 Nowadays, certain forms of mass media in Canada are thriving, while others are on the decline. This can be observed through an analysis of the effectiveness of various forms of electronic and print media in Canadian society. Identity and Mass Media in Canada As mentioned previously, the existence of two major cultural traditions has impeded the creation of a genuine Canadian community and identity. According to Irving, none of the mass media in Canada have succeeded in establishing any genuine communication between the two cultures. A creative culture exists in Quebec for French Canadians, but English Canadians (that is, those who are not exposed to French culture) are hardly aware of it. The published works of French Canadian authors remain relatively unknown in nine of the ten provinces and have little influence outside of Quebec. In addition to this, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates two separate networks for radio and television; listeners and watchers of the English stations rarely listen to the French stations, and vice versa. Irving claims that the most important problem facing Canada in terms of forming a genuine identity comes from its close proximity to the United States. It is difficult for a bilingual or multilingual country, such as Canada, Switzerland, or Belgium, to be so close to a country with one common language, such as the United States and England, because of the latter's influence on the former. Over ninety percent of the periodicals displayed on newsstands which sell more than 10,000 copies a month are American.Irving 1969, p.225 Because of this overwhelming influence of the powerful United States, Canada has been significantly slowed down in forming its own unique identity. Irving also mentions a third, less important reason for Canada's inability to form a genuine identity in history: distance and geographical regionalism. There are six distinct regions within the domain of Canada: the Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, the Prairies, British Columbia, and the northern territories. Because of the large distances between these regions, media could not spread throughout the whole country as effectively in the past. In the time of canoe transportation, this distance was a barrier to communication; with the age of the telegraph-railway, Canada finally began to edge towards becoming a proper, connected nation.Irving 1969, p.224 The Mass Media Business Model Media often consists of a two-sided market model. In such cases, each side of the market is expected to provide a form of benefit to the other in return for the same. It is a mutual system of benefit in which there are two end-users or beneficiaries.Kumar, Ravi. \\"Evolution of Two-Sided Markets\\" http://www.wsdm- conference.org/2010/proceedings/docs/p311.pdf. Retrieved October 19, 2011. A lot of times, mass media works in this way (in Canadian society as well as in any other). For example, television requires the viewer and advertisers to provide mutual network benefits. Printed books require the publisher and author to provide readers with quality work; in return, readers provide feedback and increase the popularity of the book through purchases. A newspaper's advertisers and readers mutually benefit from one another; readers provide business for advertisers while advertisers provide readers with information (since a significant portion of newspapers' funding comes from advertisers). The more successful a newspaper is, the better it gets at providing its readers with a well-rounded accumulation of news. All advertising-based media are two-sided markets. Bob Garfield explains that there are two issues with this model: widespread access to certain content has significantly lowered the amount that consumers are willing to spend on it; the audience becomes fragmented. The second issue is that the rise in available content has lowered the prices that advertisers are willing to pay in order to access a portion of the market. Special attention must be paid to the importance of advertising, particularly in newspapers. Newspapers typically generate about 70 - 80 percent of their revenue from advertising, while the remainder comes from subscriptions and sales. However, with the recent move to online publishing, there have been problems. Online advertising is not nearly as effective as print advertising, according to Eric Clemons. Although he discusses advertising in relation to newspapers in the United States, similar problems exist in Canada. He claims that Internet advertising will fail for three reasons: * Consumers do not trust advertising - Messages coming from commercial sources have proven to be considered less credible by audiences and therefore have a less powerful impact. Company sponsored blogs are among the least trusted sources of information on products and services. * Consumers are not interested in viewing advertisements - They visit websites for the main content and do not want to see things which attempt to distract them from this. * Consumers do not need advertising - If users need a product or service, they have their own sources on the Internet and prefer to use these as opposed to advertisements on websites which are not solely dedicated to the product or service. Clemons suggests alternative methods for earning money through the Internet, namely selling content and selling access to virtual communities. However, one might argue that this would not be effective in current society; since content and access has been available for free for as long as the Internet has been around, sudden charges might cause an uproar among users of the Internet. Furthermore, a portion of Internet users may not be able to afford paying for content and access, which will limit the amount of revenue businesses will bring in. In August 2015, the Canadian Media Guild, the union representing CBC journalists, became a registered third party in order to campaign for increased taxpayer funding of the CBC in the 2015 election. After the Liberal Party of Canada won the election, it increased taxpayer funding of the CBC by $150 million. In 2017, the federal government announced a five-year $50 million program to help struggling local newspapers. In 2018, it announced $595 million in tax credits to help struggling newspapers and television networks. The Mass Media Journalism Model The face of print journalism in Canada is undergoing change.\\"The Face of Print Journalism: Changing Again\\" Orangeville Citizen. http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2010-09-16/Editorial/The_face_of_print_journalism_changing_again.html , Retrieved October 19, 2011. Evening newspapers are no longer popular (one of the only surviving ones is tonight Newspaper), while morning newspapers (including the Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, the National Post, and free newspapers such as Metro and 24) have survived and continued to bring in an audience. Before the 1970s, The Globe and Mail was one of the few surviving morning papers, while most popular newspapers were distributed in the evening in Toronto. Nowadays, most newspapers have joined The Globe and Mail and are published in the morning. The newspaper industry in Canada (similar to the newspaper industry in other developed countries including the United States) is controlled by a small number of individual or corporate owners. This is referred to as concentrated ownership. Private or partially private ownership of competitive forms of news media helps to create a great amount of freedom of expression, according to Peter Desbarats.Desbarats, Peter. (1996). Guide to Canadian News Media. Harcourt Brace & Company. p. 61. However, it may be argued that even these privately owned media outlets have their own agenda, and have therefore only contributed to a limited amount of freedom of expression. Robert A. Hackett discusses this, as well as the differences between publicly owned and privately owned media outlets.http://www.cjc- online.ca/index.php/journal/article/download/1885/1962 It may also be argued that publicly owned media contribute more to freedom of expression than privately owned media; Simeon Djankov, Caralee McLeish, Tatiana Nenova, and Andrei Schleifer, in a joint Harvard-World Bank study, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of publicly owned media outlets in relation to privately owned media outlets. They write that one of the first principles of media is that it is in the public interest, and it is therefore necessary to have outlets owned by the public. In this way, the public keeps a check on the agenda of publications. If there is too much of a bias, the owners (which in this case consists of the public) react and demand a change through various forms of feedback.Djankov, Simeon, Caralee McLeish, Tatiana Nenova, and Andrei Schleifer. \\"Who Owns the Media?\\" http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/shleifer/files/media.pdf, Retrieved November 17, 2011. In contrast, privately owned outlets only have a limited number of voices to give feedback, and these voices may have their own biased agendas. Two characteristics of electronic journalism in Canada set it apart from print journalism: firstly, broadcasting is a regulated industry (which is important to consider in relation to news sources such as radio and television). This means that in order to start a broadcast station, one must have a licence from the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission. This regulated industry also affects news content because it is constantly being monitored by the agency. Secondly, many radio stations and television stations in Canada are publicly owned. Print journalism has almost always been conducted by private enterprise in Canada, and radio also started as a private enterprise which was subject to regulation by the state. It became a hybrid of private and public broadcasters.Desbarats 1996, p. 31. Nowadays, online journalism is on the rise. It provides a new platform for readers to interact instantly with news sources through blog comments and feedback. There are also various multimedia options which are not available with print journalism. For example, videos can be embedded into websites. Alexandre Gamela, a freelance journalist, says that \\"The print product is pretty much the same as it was 20, 30, 40 years ago, it is not well adapted to these new circumstances, therefore it needs to be re-thought and re-designed.\\" For these reasons, online journalism continues to gain popularity. However, as will be discussed under the section on newspapers, readerships for print newspapers in Canada seems to be steady. The Digital Democracy Project reports that Canadians both consume and somewhat trust print, broadcast and online media sources. They also consume news from social networks such as Twitter, but they mostly recognize the biased tendencies of people who actively post news on such networks. People with strong political opinions are at risk of becoming misinformed by depending only on news sources that they agree with (primarily social media, but also traditional media). Electronic Mass Media in Canada There are four main types of electronic media prevalent in Canadian society, which are explored below. Throughout history, each has seen popularity, and certain ones have seen drops in popularity as well. The Electronic Age and Marshall McLuhan In The Gutenberg Galaxy, Marshall McLuhan writes that: > if a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the > social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that > particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is > added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what > had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been > vague or opaque will become translucent. He gives great importance to the introduction of electronic media into the realm of people's everyday lives. According to McLuhan, the introduction of electronic media was one of the main media revolutions.McLuhan, Marshall. (1962). The Gutenberg Galaxy. University of Toronto Press. p.41. He claims that technology evoked an emotional response from audiences although it technically had no moral bias. Technology in the electronic age shapes an individual's (as well as a society's) self-realization. In other words, McLuhan writes about three major revolutions in his various works and gives great importance to the electronic one. Electronic mass media clearly have a large impact on Canadian society and affect audiences in a variety of ways. Television The history of television in Canada begins in Montreal and Toronto, where the first television stations were started in 1952. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired its first broadcast on September 6, 1952 from Montreal's station, CBFT. The program was bilingual. As mentioned by Irving, and supported by Arthur Siegel, modern media such as television and radio have become agents of denationalization because of the spillover of U.S. influence and fragmentation of media within Canada. Siegel implies that because of this, the state of television in Canada (i.e. whether it is healthy or dying) depends on the state of television in the United States. Television was welcomed when it was first introduced into society. It brought about a change from communication which was previously limited to only audio. If one wanted to view something on a screen, one would have to visit the cinema; the television provided a way of sitting at home and having visual communication as well as entertainment. Nowadays, however, with the introduction of smartphones and the Internet, television is headed towards obsolescence according to Rabab Khan. He writes that because smartphones and computers allow one do what a television and radio combined allow, the need for the latter two media is declining. However, he writes that television allows for a shared experience which computers and smartphones do not allow. Henry Blodget also addresses this issue and claims that because revenue and profits of the television industry are still steadily coming in, people are in denial about its inevitable failure. He states that like the newspaper industry, television is beginning to migrate to the web and investing in digital platforms. Radio The first radio broadcast station in Canadian history was WXA in Montreal, later called CINW. The first broadcast was on May 20, 1920.\\"Canadian Broadcast History\\" http://www.oldradio.com/archives/international/canada.htm, Retrieved October 20, 2011. Canada's first national radio network was established by a railway; the national radio was a product of the CNR, a state agency. Through this national radio, its creators saw a way of fostering and promoting immigration, enhancing the image of radio, and supporting the nation through communication with large groups of listeners.Robinson, Daniel. (2009). Communication History in Canada. Oxford University Press. p. 55. The consensus about radio in Canada as well as in most parts of the world is that it is a dying medium. With innovations such as television and the Internet, which have allowed for audio communication paired with visual, there has been less need for radio. Furthermore, the introduction of personalized and portable listening devices (namely mp3 players) have replaced bulkier radios for many. Whereas Internet advertising revenues have steadily increased over recent years, advertising revenue for radio only increased by about 1.5 percent from 2006 to 2007, and this rate is likely to be even smaller now. However, it is not fair to assume that radio is going to become obsolete in the near future; new forms, including online and satellite radio, have been introduced which provide new benefits for listeners. The fact that the radio industry has been able to hold its ground for so many years after the introduction of television is a testament to its longevity. Films According to the Canadian Encyclopedia: > The first Canadian films were produced in the fall of 1897, a year after the > first public exhibition of motion pictures on 27 June 1896 in Montr√©al. They > were made by James Freer, a Manitoba farmer, and depicted life on the > Prairies. In 1898-99, the Canadian Pacific Railway showed them throughout > the UK to promote immigration. They were so successful that the federal > government sponsored a second tour by Freer in 1902 and the CPR began > directly financing production of immigration films. According to an article in the Toronto Star, the Canadian film industry has always had problems with creating a popular culture because of the shadow of the United States' film industry. For this reason, Canadian films have failed due to a lack of an export market. Canadian actors frequently relocate to Hollywood to further their careers. Also, unlike radio and television, there is no protection for Canadian content in movie theatres.Taylor, Kate. \\"Canadian Film Scene Still Waiting for Happy Ending.\\" Toronto Star. https://www.thestar.com/atkinsonseries/atkinson2010/article/865562-- part-5-canadian-film-scene-still-waiting-for-happy-ending?bn=1, Retrieved November 17, 2011. It is clear that Hollywood movies are a lot more popular in Canada than Canadian-made movies. As a whole, the film industry (Hollywood) continues to make substantial profits in Canada as well as around the world; it can, therefore, be said that the medium is not dying. Internet In the 1950s and 1960s, with the creation of computers, is where the history of the Internet begins. In 1969 came the invention of Arpanet, the first network to run on packet-switching technology. These were the first hosts on what would one day become the Internet. The concept of email was first created by Ray Tomlinson in 1971, and this innovation was followed by Project Gutenberg and eBooks. Tim Berners-Lee is considered the inventor of the World Wide Web; he implemented the first successful communication between a HyperText Transfer Protocol client and a server.\\"Tim Berners-Lee - Time 100 People of the Century\\" http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990627,00.html, Retrieved November 17, 2011. Because the Internet allowed users ease of access to information about practically any topic, the medium has seen immense popularity ever since its inception. There has never been a point in its relatively short history (it has only been around for about 40 years) when it has declined in popularity. Of all mass media discussed, it seems to be the least threatened. There are various reasons for this: firstly, the Internet provides for its audiences a compilation of almost everything that other electronic media provide, in one convenient medium (a computer). For example, one can watch television shows, films, and listen to the radio online. There is little need for separate devices when everything is available in one. Secondly, the Internet allows for portability and accessibility of information. One no longer has to go to the library for information or go to a theatre in order to watch a film. Thirdly, most content on the Internet is available for free, which makes it more convenient for users. The foremost priority for the Internet has always been to better communication, and it does provide easy and fast communication through email, chat rooms, and online communities; it is also interactive in these ways. There are, however, disadvantages of this medium which do not exist in other electronic media: potential theft of personal information, spamming, and unwanted explicit content. However, as all of these disadvantages can be blocked through the use of protection software, they are not enough to override its advantages. For this reason, the Internet seems to be a healthy and thriving medium to this day in Canada as well as around the world. Print Mass Media in Canada Newspapers, printed books, and magazines are three popular forms of print mass media. Throughout history, each has seen certain levels of popularity in relation to one another and in relation to electronic media. Some have also seen drops in popularity and might be considered dying media, as explored below. Print Media and Marshall McLuhan According to McLuhan's dichotomies of hot and cool media, print media occupy mostly a visual space, rather than other senses such as that of hearing (which is involved in media like television). He writes that this makes print media a hot medium, as it provides the reader with complete involvement without considerable stimulus.McLuhan, Marshall. (1964). Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. McGraw Hill. pp. 22--25. Because print media are hot media, they involve relatively little interaction from users. McLuhan discussed three main media revolutions, one of them coming about with the invention of the printing press. He explained that with texts being mass-produced there was a new level of immediacy, accessibility, and a subsequent rise in literacy; in manuscript culture, access to texts was limited to a privileged few, whereas in print culture, literature increasingly became a commodity. For this reason, print media was revolutionary at the time. However, with the more recent electronic revolution, the importance of print began to decline, as discussed below. Newspapers The first period of Canadian journalism spanned from 1752‚Äì1807; the second period spanned from 1807‚Äì1858; the third period spanned from 1858‚Äì1900; the fourth period spans from the beginning of the twentieth century to current day. The first period consisted of newspapers brought and inserted into Canadian society by colonies in New England. The first was the Halifax Gazette, issued on March 23, 1752. The second period began as settlers arrived from Britain and the United States; newspapers began to gain popularity in the Maritime regions. During the third period, the discovery of gold brought settlers to the Pacific Coast region, and there was a growing interest in domestic affairs. Finally, the twentieth century saw a substantial change in Canadian newspapers. After the two world wars, as well as the industrial developments that followed these wars, the circulation of French and English newspapers in Canada increased to more than 5.7 million in 1989. By the mid-1980s, there were 110 daily newspapers. Nowadays, there are 105. Although online readership has been on the rise, studies by NADbank show that print readership is \\"business as usual.\\" Nearly 8 in 10 Canadians read a daily newspaper each week, and print readership continues to grow at about 2 percent each year.Crassweller, Anne. \\"Readership is \\"business as usual\\" in Canada\\" IMMA. http://www.inma.org/blogs/value-content/post.cfm/readership-is-ldquo- business-as-usual-rdquo-in-canada, Retrieved November 17, 2011. However, website readership is growing faster, at a rate of 4 percent. Although print readership is currently larger, website readership is growing at a faster rate, suggesting that a takeover is possible in the future. The baby boomer generation, who are over 50 years old, continue to prefer print to online journalism, while younger adults are more likely to read online newspapers due to easier access and limits on time. Furthermore, paid daily newspapers dominate the market but free dailies are gaining popularity in recent times. Advertisers continue to rely on print newspapers to reach Canadians in their home or work environments. For these reasons, print newspapers as a mass medium do not seem to be dying in Canada. They might not be as healthy as they were without any competition from online sources, but they are holding their own ground, according to Statistics Canada. Printed Books As mentioned above, the first incident of printing in Canada came in 1752 with the Halifax Gazette. The history of the printed book is slightly different. In 1761, Anton Heinrich took over John Bushell's printing shop in Halifax. James Rivingston, a member of a family involved with bookselling and stationery in London, advertised a large stock of books and stationery for sale in Halifax. The first printing shop was established in 1764 by William Brown and Thomas Gilmore in Quebec. The earliest recorded almanac published in Canada was , printed by Brown and Gilmore in 1765.Fleming, Patricia. (2004). History of the Book in Canada. University of Toronto Press. p. 25. There are many who think that with the introduction of the Internet and e-reading, the printed book is on the decline for reasons of practicality; e-readers (such as the Kindle and Kobo) allow one to carry many books at once, are as portable as printed books, and provide instantaneous access to books (as opposed to having to search for printed books in a store). They can also be interactive, containing audio and image components and allowing readers to change font styles to suit their own preference. Certain people think that despite the introduction of e-books, the printed book is not a dying medium. The death of the book was predicted with the advent of radio, then film, then with television, and more recently with the Internet. Because of its history of perseverance, some people have hope that it will survive despite the e-book's various advantages. More people around the world have access to books in printed form than to computers. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that reading off of a screen for long periods of time is less comfortable in the long run than reading print off of a page. For these reasons, whether or not the printed book is a dying medium in Canada can be debated either way; however, for now it seems that they are surviving and adapting (for example, through the use of more attractive graphics) despite such competition. Magazines The first Canadian periodicals were established in Nova Scotia by people from New England. The first Canadian magazine was called Nova Scotia Magazine and Comprehensive Review of Literature, Politics, and News. It was edited by William Cochran and printed by John Howe. Publication began in 1789 and lasted three years. This magazine dealt mostly with affairs concerning the British public, despite its being published at a time of colonization in Canada.Desbarats, Peter. (2009). \\"The Special Role of Magazines in the History of Canadian Mass Media and National Development.\\" Communication History in Canada. Oxford University Press. p.169. After this first publication, most magazines over the next fifty years in Canada only lasted a few years, often only a few months. The first ever bilingual magazine, published in 1792, was entitled Le Magasin de Qu√©bec; it was published by Samuel Neilson. Journalist and historian Michel Bibaud published La Biblioth√®que Canadienne from 1825 to 1830, and John Lovell published the Literary Garland from 1838 to 1851. These were the most well- known exceptions to the rule that magazines lasted only a few years.Desbarats 2009, p.169. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the pace of magazine publishing in Canada picked up significantly. George Desbarats launched Canadian Illustrated News in 1869 and it lasted until 1883. Canadian Illustrated News was closely identified with a new emerging sense of Canadian nationalism, like other magazines of the time. Through the use of many pictures, Desbarats felt that the magazine would instill a sense of pride in readers for their Canadian name and society.Desbarats 2009, p.170 According to David Renard, \\"Over the next 10 years, the magazine industry will experience deep-rooted change from primarily a print-oriented business to one where digital products will represent the largest share of a smaller periodical industry. We expect digital to be the primary source of revenue for magazines past the 2016-2017 time frame.\\" He claims that although print is not dead, the magazine industry might become obsolete. Although he is referring to periodicals in the United States, similar patterns exist in Canada, since over ninety percent of the most popular periodicals sold in Canada are American. Some say that magazines are evolving rather than dying; they are adapting to new technology by creating online versions. For example, iPad versions of magazines have been created recently. However, this still implies that the printed medium of periodicals is dying while online versions are gaining popularity.

Grossherzogliches Jagdhaus im Domanial-Amt Neustadt. at lexikus.de It is also possibly related to the Old Slavic meaning \\"to water\\" or \\"rain\\", the Russian lyva or liva meaning \\"swamp wood\\" or the Bulgarian/Serbian livada meaning \\"pasture\\".Paul K√ºhnel, Die slavischen Ortsnamen in Meklenburg in Jahrb√ºcher des Vereins f√ºr Mecklenburgische Geschichte und Altertumskunde. - Bd. 46 (1881), p. 83  History  The Lewitz was formed, like the whole of Mecklenburg, in the last ice age. When the glacier melted it filled the Lewitz and the St√∂r valley with meltwater which scoured out a basin, 12,000 hectares in area. A 16 metre deep lake was formed. Later it suddenly emptied southwards. The lake became marshy and turned into peat over the course of the following millennia. Shallow waterbodies and fens (Niedermoore). In the Middle Stone Age its island-like hills, small lakes and woods offered hunters, gatherers and fishers suitable places to settle. Likewise the dried out, sandy moorlands were suitable for the arable farmers and cattle breeders of the New Stone Age. During that time several Funnelbeaker culture earthworks were constructed. In the 13th century the Lewitz depression was still covered by oak, beech, black alder and birch. The expanding towns during the Hanseatic period obtained their wood from the Lewitz and other areas. From the early 16th century to the 18th century Neustadt-Glewe was one of the centres of bog iron ore smelting. The iron was surface-mined. The Lewitz was well suited to this wood-hungry industry with its river system and extensive woodlands. Charcoal was made from the wood and this in turn became fuel for the smelting ovens. In 1577 alone, 6,300 tonnes of coal and 8,300 cubic metres of wood were needed. In addition, so-called Holzdeputanten (\\"wood deputies\\") of the princely house and court, \\"wood taxes\\" paid to the surrounding towns and a flourishing timber trade led to a shrinkage of the stocks of timber. By the 17th century these stood at only 25% of their original size. In 1620 the last beech and oak trees were felled in Tuckhude for the construction of Kraaker Castle. The timber industry was unsustainable, with the result that the last iron smeltery in Neustadt closed in 1717 due to a lack of wood. At that time the forests of the surrounding area were almost entirely gone and in their place boggy pastures emerged that were harvested for hay. The Friedrichsmoor Forest Office (Forstamt Friedrichsmoor) that was established in the 18th century managed the reforestation of small areas of land in the years that followed. However, a complete restoration of the original forests was not carried out, because as early as the end of the 1820s, people expected that income from the management of pasture would exceed that of the timber industry. In 1862/63 the Brenz Canal was constructed in order to drain the land northwest of Brenz and enable it to be used for agriculture. In 1862 the head office for the administrative department of the ducal court in the Lewitz was established in Tuckhude. It was responsible for the maintenance of the ditches, paths, bridges, control of irrigation and drainage, monitoring the water levels and ensuring the harvest. By 1938 parts of the Lewitz were already being placed under conservation orders due to their importance as breeding areas for waders. Breeding species here include the curlew, redshank, black-tailed godwit and ruff. During the GDR period, from 1958 to 1962 and 1976 to 1980, with the introduction of industrial agricultural production methods, complex, large-scale land improvement work was carried out in order to create grassland for cattle breeding. Many animal and plant species disappeared, as did the population of breeding birds on the pasture land. In the Neustadt village of Hohes Feld horses were bred for riding at the Lewitz VEG along with cattle breeding. Since 1971 there has been a new breed of horse, the Lewitzer or Lewitzschecken from its piebald (gescheckt) colour. The Lewitz estate has been run since the Wende by German show jumper and businessman, Paul Schockem√∂hle. Since 1990 land improvement measures have been partially reversed. Wet biotopes with wet meadows and bogs have been recreated out of pasture and arable land. As a result, several threatened species of plant and animal have established themselves here. osprey, falcon, otter, great crested newt and grass snake have been seen once more. The Lewitz is a popular stopover for wild geese, crane and other migratory birds. Amongst the rare plants in the Lewitz are orchids, Pasqueflower, common tormentil and marsh gentian. The Lewitz is today both a protected area and nature reserve. Parts of the landscape were also designated as a European Bird Reserve at the end of the 20th century.Standarddatenbogen EU-Vogelschutzgebiet Lewitz  Tourism  Friedrichsmoor hunting lodge There are attempts to market the Lewitz as a destination for sustainable tourism. Brown tourist signs to \\"The Lewitz\\", with outlines of Neustadt Castle and the countryside, have been installed on the A 24 motorway. The aim is to attract especially nature lovers and water explorers. Also worth seeing are the Friedrichsmoor hunting lodge, the preserve of former dukes, the Tuckhude Land Office (Wiesenmeisterei) and the Banzkow Mill.

Bembry represented the 10th District in the House, which included Hamilton, Madison, and Taylor Counties, and parts of Alachua, Columbia, Dixie, Franklin, Jefferson, Levy, and Wakulla Counties. He ran for Congress in 2012, but lost in the Democratic primary to Al Lawson. History Bembry was born in Jasper, Florida on his family's tobacco farm. He worked as a page in the Florida Legislature in 1960, and his cousin, Payton Bembry, Jr., served in the State House in the mid-1960s. Bembry attended North Florida Community College, receiving his associates degree, and Florida State University, though he did not graduate. He later owned and operated his family tobacco farm, and acquired three other farms in North Florida with his wife, including Pettis Springs Farm in Greenville. Bembry participated in the Florida Farm Bureau's County Alliance for Responsible Environmental Stewardship program, organized against the construction of a coal-fired energy plant near his farms. In addition to farming, Bembry also owned and operated University Homes, a mobile home dealership and served as a member of the Madison County Development Council. Career  Florida House  When incumbent Republican State Representative Will Kendrick was term-limited in the 10th House District, Bembry announced a campaign to replace him, running as a conservative Democrat. Bembry faced Julie Conley, the director of the Jefferson County Economic Development Council and the former mayor of Monticello, in the Democratic primary. Bembry defeated Conley 58‚Äì42%. In the general election, Bembry faced Don Curtis, a small business owner and former assistant director of the Florida Division of Forestry. Bembry emphasized that he was a \\"very conservative Democrat\\" and argued that while the state budget needed to be prioritized, \\"we don't need to raise more taxes.\\" He campaigned on his experience on the county development council, arguing that the county's model should be expanded across the district to develop infrastructure and attract jobs. He won the endorsements of unions like the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, the Communication Workers of America, and other trade unions. Bembry won the election 54‚Äì46%. During his first term in the legislature, Bembry successfully passed legislation that waived therapist confidentiality when their patient poses a \\"clear and imminent probability of harm\\" and that established a pest control insurance fund to finance pest control operations. In 2010, Bembry ran for re-election and faced Republican David Feigin, a retired Coast Guard veteran and a pizzeria owner. Bembry defeating Feigin by a wide 59‚Äì41% margin. In Bembry's second and final term in the legislature, he worked with Madison County residents to shut down an attempt by Nestl√© to extract 1.5 million gallons of water every day from the Wacissa River and bottle it, which resulted in the county commission enacting an aquifer protection ordinance. When Governor Rick Scott attempted to close down the Jefferson Correctional Institution in Monticello, Bembry attempted to convince the House budget committee to oppose the effort, but was ultimately unsuccessful.  2012 congressional campaign  On November 17, 2011, Bembry announced that he would challenge Republican Congressman Steve Southerland in Florida's 2nd congressional district in 2012 rather than seek a third term in the legislature. Bembry began his campaign by criticizing Southerland for not keeping the promises he made in 2010, and by announcing that he would focus on job creation, cutting taxes, protecting seniors, and protecting the region's water resources. Owing to his reputation as the \\"most conservative Democrat in the House,\\" he was endorsed by the Blue Dog PAC, which supports conservative Democrats. Bembry faced former State Senator Al Lawson, former Bay County Democratic Party chairman Alvin Peters, and Florida Innocence Project chairman Mark Schlakman in the Democratic primary. Former Republican state senator Nancy Argenziano was planning on joining the race, but she was barred by state law from running as a Democrat, and so opted to run for the state house instead. Bembry started off the race as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's preferred candidate, featuring him as running in an \\"emerging race.\\" However, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, like Congresswoman Corrine Brown and then-Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn, split with party leadership, endorsing Lawson. Lawson won the Democratic primary by a wide margin, receiving 55% of the vote to Bembry's 26%, Peters's 14%, and Schlakman's 5%.

Once the possibility of look-elsewhere error in an analysis is acknowledged, it can be compensated for by careful application of standard mathematical techniques. More generally known in statistics as the problem of multiple comparisons, the term gained some media attention in 2011, in the context of the search for the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. Use Many statistical tests deliver a p-value, the probability that a given result could be obtained, assuming random coincidence. When asking \\"does X affect Y?\\", it is common to vary X and see if there is significant variation in Y as a result. If this p-value is less than some predetermined statistical significance threshold Œ±, one considers the result \\"significant\\". However, if one is performing multiple tests (\\"looking elsewhere\\" if the first test fails) then a p value of 1/n is expected to occur after about n tests. For example, when there is no real effect, an event with p < 0.05 will on average still be seen after 20 tests. In order to compensate for this, you could divide your threshold Œ± by the number of tests n, so a result is significant when p < Œ±/n. Or, equivalently, multiply the observed p value by the number of tests (significant when np < Œ±). This is a simplified case; the number n is actually the number of degrees of freedom in the tests, or the number of effectively independent tests. If they are not fully independent, the number may be lower than the number of tests. The look- elsewhere effect is a frequent cause of \\"significance inflation\\" when the number of independent tests n is underestimated because failed tests are not published. One paper may fail to mention alternative hypotheses considered, or a paper producing no result may simply not be published at all, leading to journals dominated by statistical outliers.  Examples  * A Swedish study in 1992 tried to determine whether or not power lines caused some kind of poor health effects. The researchers surveyed everyone living within 300 meters of high-voltage power lines over a 25-year period and looked for statistically significant increases in rates of over 800 ailments. The study found that the incidence of childhood leukemia was four times higher among those that lived closest to the power lines, and it spurred calls to action by the Swedish government. The problem with the conclusion, however, was that they failed to compensate for the look-elsewhere effect; in any collection of 800 random samples, it is likely that at least one will be at least 3 standard deviations above the expected value, by chance alone. Subsequent studies failed to show any links between power lines and childhood leukemia, neither in causation nor even in correlation. * The Bible Code phenomenon purports to find atypical significant groupings of words predicting future events hidden in text of the Hebrew Bible taken as a raw sequence of unspaced letters and arranged into various grids of different proportions. However, as an article in Skeptical Inquirer demonstrated, this amounts to generating vast numbers of grids to examine for patterns or groupings by dividing the full text string into widths of from a few to hundreds of thousands of letters wide, repeating the width for subsequent rows. Each one of those many grids can then in turn be searched further for a wide range of words of interest by skipping in intervals, forward or backward, of an arbitrary x letters in the text (or x+1, x+2, etc.), in a massive cross product of parameterized possibilities, and an associated coincident word of interest can be any nearby string in an arbitrary skip of x+k or y+k letters, forward or backward, such that the permutational volumes become enormous. Thus, setting aside related questions like confirmation bias, even if no groupings of interest or significance were found in the first grid, the next iteration can be tried by computer and so on en masse until \\"miraculous\\" or \\"improbable\\" groupings are finally arrived at. This is tantamount in effect to, upon dealing oneself an uninteresting poker hand, continuing to do so in whatever great quantities necessary until one obtains a straight flush, royal flush, or even many such events in sequence, and calling the deck inspired for enabling such a result. The Skeptical Inquirer author was thus able to achieve identical effects simply by applying the same search algorithms both to the English language King James Bible text in place of the allegedly divinely inspired Hebrew version, and then just as effectively to the mundane and arbitrary example text of the 1987 United States Supreme Court decision Edwards v.

The 2016 Census reported that 12.7 percent of all Canadian households in 2006 and in 2016, were in core housing need. In 2011, the percentage dropped slightly to 12.5 percent.In 2016, the Canadian regions with the most households experiencing core housing need included Nunavut at 36.5 percent, Northwest Territories at 15.5 percent, Ontario at 15.3 percent, and Yukon at 15.2 percent. The 2016 Census also showed that the highest rates of core housing need in metropolitan areas were Toronto at 19.1 percent and Vancouver at 17.6 percent. Prior to the introduction of Canada's National Housing Strategy in November 2017, Canada was the only G8 nation that lacked a National Housing Strategy. The Strategy provided $40 billion of funding over 10 years to build 100,000 new affordable units, repair 300,000 affordable units and to cut homelessness by 50% . Background The economy has grown from the mid-1990s onward at the \\"strongest, most sustained pace since the 1960s\\" and Canada has a strong real estate market while many Canadian households face housing insecurity. Statistics Canada reported that while Canada's \\"real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased by roughly 50% between 1980 and 2005,\\" and the workforce increased educational attainment and work experience during this same period and median earnings among the top 20% of full-time full-year employees grew by 17.9%\\", among those in the bottom one-fifth of the distribution median earnings decreased by 13.3%.\\" Full-time full-year median earnings of Canadians edged only slightly higher from $41,348 in 1980 to $41,401 in 2005. Between 1997‚Äì2007, 1% or 246,000 Canadians earned average incomes of $405,000 representing 32% of all growth in incomes.There were 24.6 million tax filers in Canada in 2007. The richest 1% made more than $169,000 and had an average income of $404,000. The richest 0.1% made more than $621,000 and had an average income of $1.49 million. The richest 0.01% made more than $1.85 million and had an average income of $3.83 million (Yalnizya 2010). Since 2000 the cost of renting increased by more than 20 per cent. By 2004, 1.7 million Canadians had housing affordability issues. Since 2005, the number of rental units declined. In 2006, about 1.5 million Canadian households or 12.7 per cent of Canadian households were in core housing need. Housing policies across Canada that address the issue of affordability of housing acknowledge a housing continuum that encourages home ownership and rental in the private sector but also provides rental and/or income assistance to low income households, high level support services to the most vulnerable citizens (frail elderly, disabled, mentally challenged, single parents, etc.) from short-term transitional housing, longer-term supportive housing, to emergency shelters for the homeless. Housing policies and strategies consider repeat users and those who face multiple barriers to meet and maintain core housing needs and therefore provide a wide range of support services including life skills training and assistance programs to break the cycle of poverty (BC Housing Strategy 2006). In this way housing strategies and housing studies related to affordability of housing overlap with anti-poverty strategies and studies. In the mid-1990s in Canada, homelessness‚Äîat the most extreme end of the housing affordability continuum‚Äîreached a level of a recognized national crisis affecting a diverse population of individuals and families. Lack of affordable housing is one of the complex set of factors that lead to homelessness. All levels of government in Canada began to include housing policies and strategies that respond to the crisis although anti-poverty and ending-homelessness activists argued that the efforts are not sufficient, efficient, or sustainable.Stephen Gaetz is director of the Canadian Homelessness Research Network and the Homeless Hub and secretary of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness. By 2007, affordability of housing was a problem for low and middle income Canadians, while households in the upper quintile‚Äîparticularly in large affluent urban areas‚Äîcould afford to purchase houses for investment and/or residency at higher prices while benefitting from historically low interest rates. Canadian government public policies intervene when affordability of housing is stressed to the point home ownership becomes inaccessible even to individuals with full-time employment. Measuring affordability of housing is complicated by Canada's vast physical and human geography which includes remote northern communities and affluent urban regions. Income levels in the upper quintile have increased exponentially while those in lower quintiles have remained stagnant. In 2011, about 1.5 million Canadian households or 12.5 per cent of Canadian households were in core housing need, and various levels of governance in Canada were exploring policy solutions to assist challenges faced by the low-income renter and homeowner overburdened with shelter costs. By 2012, the rising inequality gap had presented a significant challenge for Canadian households who were \\"priced out\\" of rental and ownership housing markets. By 2012, there was a slight deterioration in housing affordability, according to the RBC.RBC measures erosion, deterioration and/or improvements in affordability of housing in terms of levels of ease or difficulty for Canadians to carry the costs of home ownership comparing price, mortgage rate, utilities and taxes and income while also considering fundamentals such as supply-and-demand and market slowdown. Vigorous housing demand raises prices if supply has not kept pace. RBC also examines soft factors such as weather; mild weather, for example, motivates consumer demand for housing (RBC 2012-08). Many parts of the country also reported that key workers‚Äîteachers, nurses, police officers, construction workers and others ‚Äì who earned reasonably good income from their professions, were finding it increasingly difficult to afford the high cost of housing.\\" According to a Federation of Canadian Municipalities 2012 report, one third of Canadians were renters. The construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental units had not kept pace with the number of affordable rental units lost to demolition, urban intensification projects and the more profitable conversion to condominiums. Fewer than 10 per cent of new housing starts were rental units. The FCA finds the shortage of available rental housing is worsening at the same time that more Canadians are being priced out of home ownership. In 2016, about 1.7 million Canadian households or 12.7 per cent of Canadian households were in core housing need. The percentage was slightly higher in urban areas, with about 13.6% of all Canadian households living in urban areas‚Äî1.6 million urban households‚Äîwere in core housing need. In 2016, the regions with the highest percentage of households in core housing need, were Nunavut with 36.5 percent, Northwest Territories at 15.5 percent, Ontario at 15.3 percent, and Yukon at 15.2 percent. In 2016, the highest rates of core housing need in metropolitan areas included Toronto at 19.1 percent, Vancouver at 17.6 percent, Belleville at 15.4 percent, and Peterborough at 15.1 percent. Fundamental forces of supply and demand in the Canadian housing market The Canadian housing supply market responds to housing price changes with relative speed and flexibility compared to other OECD countries. New housing supply is relatively more flexible in Canada than in continental European countries and in the United Kingdom. Caldera and Johansson argue that new housing supply depends on \\"national, geographical and urban characteristics but also on policies, such as land use and planning regulations.\\" Affordability of housing is affected by the way in which housing supply markets respond to changes in prices either through increased construction or raising prices. In supply- constrained markets like Vancouver, most adjustment occurs in higher prices rather than expanding housing supply. In the short to medium term supply- constrained/high-demand markets result in higher prices. Greater supply and low demand result in lower prices. Unresponsive housing markets cause price volatility including demand shocks that affect residential investment resulting in economic instability.A crucial factor determining the functioning of housing markets is the responsiveness of housing supply to changes in prices. Differences in supply responsiveness to prices are important since they determine the extent to which the housing market responds to demand side shocks with more construction or higher prices, with potential implications for the evolution of housing prices and housing affordability. Indeed, existing evidence suggests that in supply-constrained markets, most of the adjustment occurs in the price of housing rather than in expanding housing supply.(Glaeser and Gyourko. 2008) Supply conditions also matter for house price volatility and aggregate economic stability. An unresponsive housing supply can increase the sensitivity of house prices to demand shocks and, thus, influence private consumption patterns and residential investment. For instance, in the short to medium term, an increase in housing demand will translate into lower increases in real house prices in areas with more responsive housing supply. However, the flip side is that in flexible-supply areas, housing investment adjusts more rapidly to large changes in demand contributing to more cyclical swings in economic growth, as witnessed by recent developments. A quantification of the responsiveness of housing supply with respect to prices can, therefore, shed light on the trend evolution and volatility of house prices in OECD countries and inform housing policy reforms aimed at dampening housing price volatility and, in interaction with macro policies, increase macroeconomic resilience to shocks (Caldera and Johansson. 2011:5). According to Mark Carney‚Äîthe Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2011 to 2006‚Äîhousehold formation in Canada, the underlying demand force, is broadly consistent with housing supply. \\"Canadian housing market developments in recent years have largely reflected the evolution of supply and demand. Carney warned in 2011, that even though measures of housing affordability in Canada were favorable in most cases‚Äîwith some housing markets already severely unaffordable even at current rate‚Äîinterest rates were at a record low. He raised concerns that Canadian household debt was high and therefore vulnerable to increases in mortgage interest rates which could cause housing affordability fall to \\"its worst level in 16 years.\\" Measuring affordability of housing Homeless man in VancouverGovernments, financial institutions (banks, mortgage providers), housing sectors (real estate agencies), consumers, and advocacy organizations use different definitions of affordability. Measuring affordability of housing is complicated by Canada's vast physical and human geography which includes remote northern communities and affluent urban regions. Housing prices and construction costs have risen dramatically in Canada as they have elsewhere in the world. Income levels in the upper quintile have increased exponentially while those in lower quintiles have remained stagnant. Affordability as needs-based concept: core housing need By 1991, Canadian public policy on the affordability of housing was more aligned with the concept of need than in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, for example, where the concept of affordability was more market-oriented.In the United Kingdom for example since the late 1980s, housing policy debates shifted away from discussion of housing need to more market-oriented analyses of affordability (Whitehead 1991-12). Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) considers a household to be in \\"core housing need if its housing: falls below at least one of the adequacy, affordability or suitability standards and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (meets all three housing standards)(CMHC, 2012).\\" About 5.1 per cent of Canadian households were considered to be in severe housing need, spending 50 per cent or more on shelter in 2006. The CMHC consider households that spend 30% or more of total before-tax household income on shelter expenses, have a \\"housing affordability\\" problem. Shelter expenses include \\"rent and any payments for electricity, fuel, water and other municipal services\\" for renters and \\"mortgage payments (principal and interest), property taxes, and any condominium fees, along with payments for electricity, fuel, water and other municipal services\\" for home owners. In 1986, CMHC entered into Global and Operating Agreements under the National Housing Act and the CMHC Act, with the provinces and territories regarding administration and cost sharing of social housing programs. The core housing need concept was developed and adopted as an eligibility criterion to target households who were in need and as a basis to allocate federal funds through CMHC to participating provinces and territories. Core housing need does not measure progress against some measurable indicator. A 2011 article said that affordability of housing public policy analysts should also monitor other indicators that are more appropriate for the contemporary Canadian context such as, what proportion of rental units are affordable to a median income rental household, a comparison of wage requirement needed to rent unit, the demand for housing assistance, the number of households in core need as a milestone measure, the number of people using emergency homeless shelters, number of people filing notice of eviction, arrears or foreclosures, rental vacancy rates at market prices, rental vacancy units at modest-low income stock and the number of MLS sales affordable to marginal buyers. Market-based affordability A large proportion of Canadians are housed in market-based suburban developments such as Markham, OntarioEighty percent of Canadians are served by market-based housing, which includes individual home ownership and private rental housing. In the market- based housing system, individuals finance their own housing, independent of government assistance. A 2019 RBC Economics report on home affordability said that, in nine of the 14 market areas they track, a majority of Canadian families are able to purchase an average home. The most affordable markets are Saint John, St. John‚Äôs, Regina, Quebec City and Halifax, while the least least-affordable markets are Vancouver, Toronto, and Victoria. However, the shelter-cost-to-income ratio (STIR) is well above 30% for the median income. Nationally, it is 48.7% for two-story homes. Major cities such as Vancouver rate worst in the world at 88.9%. Calgary is considered affordable at 36.7%. Montreal is 41.8% and Toronto is 53.4%. The RBC Indicator provides data on a quarterly basis on home ownership affordability, it measures the proportion of homes currently for sale that are affordable to a median income household. Measurements of affordability that are oriented exclusively to the ability to buy using mainly shelter-cost-to-income ratio (STIR) provide useful information for one end of the continuum of housing in Canada, home ownership in the private market at market price. The Bank of Canada's 2011 \\"affordability index represents the proportion of the average personal disposable income per worker that goes toward mortgage payments, based on current house prices and mortgage rates. A decline in the ratio indicates an improvement in affordability.\\" Mortgage lending institutions define affordability in terms of potential home buyers consider the relative cost of debt based on interest rates and average household incomes. This measure of affordability is not oriented towards renters. A 2012 report produced by the Bank of Canada argues that affordability of housing \\"has been consistently favourable by historical standards since the late 1990s. . . Despite increases in house prices, generally favourable labour market conditions (gains in real income) and low interest rates have supported affordability and contributed to the significant increases in home ownership and mortgage debt.\\" In the 21st century, the gap between incomes of the upper quintile and lower quintile reached unprecedented extremes according to reports in 2006 and 2010. In its 2016 second quarter report Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation warned housing prices are overvalued in 9 Canadian markets, with Vancouver at high risk. Strong evidence of \\"problematic conditions\\" also continue to exist in Toronto, Calgary, Saskatoon and Regina, while in Ottawa \\"problematic conditions\\" are weak. \\"Affordability is a relative measure, especially in a country with a booming real estate market. Housing market growth, in part fuelled by availability of debt and mortgage financing, augments existing inequities. While many homeowners benefit from low interest rates, the national pool of private affordable rental stock remains small and affordable rental vacancy rate remains low, less than one per cent in many cities.\\" Renters in the lowest income quarter are 18 times more likely to experience housing affordability problems than other Canadians. Shelter-cost-to-income ratio (STIR) A commonly accepted guideline for housing affordability is a cost that does not exceed 30 percent of a household's gross income. When the monthly carrying costs of a home exceed 30‚Äì35 percent of household income, then the housing is considered unaffordable for that household. Determining housing affordability is complex and the commonly used housing-expenditure-to- income-ratio tool has been challenged. Canada, for example, switched to a 25 percent rule from a 20 percent rule in the 1950s. In the 1980s, this was replaced by a 30 percent rule. Unresolved issues remain about the elements of affordable housing. Affordability of housing may have differing definitions to governments, mortgage providers, developers, urban planners, economists and individual householders seeking a residence. Income levels in relation to housing prices are the most frequently used variables in deciding housing affordability but other factors such as employment trends, access to (and the cost of) finance, demographic shifts, housing preferences and other housing costs besides the price of purchase impact on housing affordability. One question is what should be included in 'housing' costs. Such expenses could include taxes, insurance, utility costs, maintenance and/or furnishings and rent for owners and/or tenants. Another question is what is meant by 'income'. Does this include gross or net income; one or all adults' income; and children's income, if any. It is also unclear how sharp temporary fluctuations in income and non-cash sources of goods and services get factored into the calculation. Londerville also notes that the maximum Total Debt Service ratio (the \\"ratio of the borrower's total debt payments, including mortgage payments and property taxes, to their gross household income\\") is underused in evaluating affordability. \\"There is an argument that the calculation should be based on take home pay rather than gross pay. It could be different for different income levels ‚Äì 40 percent of $40,000 does not leave a lot of room for other household expenses. Young homeowners who have children in daycare can be paying a fee almost equivalent to a second mortgage payment; this is not taken into account when calculating the maximum the bank will lend because it is not defined as a debt.\\" Housing Affordability Index Accurate measurement of housing affordability is needed to decide if a family qualifies for assistance in housing or for a mortgage to purchase privately. While the 30% rule may be used for the latter, banks and lending agencies might require a much higher Qualifying Income before approving a mortgage. The Royal Bank of Canada Housing Affordability Measure describes a qualifying income as \\"the minimum annual income used by lenders to measure the ability of a borrower to make mortgage payments. Typically, no more than 32% of a borrower's gross annual income should go to 'mortgage expenses'‚Äîprincipal, interest, property taxes and heating costs.\\" Affordability problem Homeless man living in a bus shelter in downtown Toronto (2010)\\"Housing affordability problems threaten both low and middle income households. While affordability in housing has improved for many Canadians, due mainly to income gains, the fortunes of the lower half of Canadians remain stagnant or have declined. Across Canada, renter households in the lowest income quarter have highly elevated ‚Äì 18 times average ‚Äì likelihood of housing affordability problems.\\" Even though house prices have risen faster than income since the 1990s, there has been a rise in home-ownership rate from 62.1 per cent in 1981 to 68.4 per cent in 2006. The banking industry views greater credit growth and higher debt loads related to house purchases as a positive. But a \\"strong credit growth\\" from 2001 to 2011 means very high household indebtedness which now represents c. 150 per cent of debt-to-income ratio. According to the Bank of Canada's affordability measure (AFF) -the ratio of monthly mortgage payments to disposable income (DI)- \\"has been consistently favourable by historical standards since the late 1990s. Despite increases in house prices, generally favourable labour market conditions (gains in real income) and low interest rates have supported affordability and contributed to the significant increases in home ownership and mortgage debt.\\" There are concerns about aggressive marketing that began in the mid-1990s making secured personal lines of credit (PLCs) (often secured by housing assets) much more widely available. By 2011 secured PLCs represented 50 per cent of consumer debt. This places many households in a vulnerable exposed situation if housing prices drop, mortgage rates rise, or their income decreases. Concerns over high Canadian household debt levels led to changes to mortgage regulations announced June, 2012 by Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. The federal government lowered the maximum amortization period for a government-insured mortgage from 30 to 25 years. The upper limit Canadian homeowners could borrow against their home equity was lowered from 85 per cent to 80 per cent. Londerville of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute argues for 40-year amortizations in \\"certain markets and for certain age groups, perhaps with limits on the house price\\" for example in the case of young households in the high-priced Toronto real estate market who \\"may need a 40-year amortization period on their first home to make it affordable.\\" As well, government-backed mortgage insurance purchased at a flat, upfront fee for mortgage insurance through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is obligatory for home buyers with down of less than 20 per cent of the home's value.\\" In a 2005 article the Canadian Business journal reported that, \\"According to the federal Bank Act, every mortgage from a federally regulated institution with a down payment of less than 25% is required to carry mortgage insurance. Last year [2004], 45 per cent of all home buyers, or 500,000 Canadian families, were required to buy a total of $1.6 billion worth of mortgage insurance ... According to its annual report, last year it earned $1.1 billion in premiums from homebuyers and paid out $51 million in claims--a payout rate of less than 5 per cent. While 2004 was an exceptional year for mortgage insurance, over the past 10 years CMHC has paid out at an average rate of 45 per cent, far lower than most other forms of insurance. In fact, there is probably no more lucrative line of insurance in Canada than mortgage insurance.\\" The CMHC turns a large profit from this mortgage insurance collected mainly from first time buyers and those unable because of lower incomes to pay more than 20 per cent down payment. Between 2001 and 2010 this mortgage insurance amounted to a $14 billion contribution towards reducing the Canadian federal debt. Londerville of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute notes IMF concerns about some CMHC practices and the unnecessary burden placed on home owners at the lower end of income scale. This erodes affordability. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) deemed that 20 percent of Canadian households (1.7 million households) fall within the core housing need. These households could not find adequate and suitable housing without spending 30 percent or more of their pre-tax income. CMHC found that a disturbing 656,000 households (7 percent) spent at least half of their before- tax income on shelter in 1996, up from 422,000 households, or 5 percent, in 1991. While accounting for only 35 percent of all households, almost 70 percent of those in core need were renters. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a highly critical and detailed report on Canada's social policies in its 1998 review of Canada's compliance with these rights (United Nations, 1998) particularly about disastrous levels of homelessness. It concluded \\"that while Canada has a long history of housing successes, the housing cuts starting in the late 1980s have effectively prevented Canada from meeting its international housing obligations.\\" The mayors of Canada's largest cities, declared the lack of affordable housing a national housing disaster in 1998. The federal government responded by announcing cost-shared conditional federal-provincial initiatives to construct affordable housing, worth $1 billion. However, during this period of tax cutting and debt reduction initiatives, the devolution of federal responsibilities to the provinces, without an accompanying transfer of funds, made it impossible for the provinces to contribute their share for affordable housing projects. Provinces were focused on reducing government size and increasing provincial tax cuts. in 2006 5.5% of Canadians, 1.7 million people of a total population of 31 million were under-housed or non-housed.(Canadian Housing and Renewal Association). Causes and consequences of the affordability problem =Causes= A study by M. Lio on \\"The Impact of Higher Energy Efficiency Standards on Housing Affordability in Alberta\\" funded by NAIMA Canada and the Consumers Council of Canada investigated the impact of total selling price of the house, cost of land, cost of labour, and the cost of materials on housing affordability for the cities of Calgary and Edmonton in 2010. The results showed that the rising cost of labour and materials are attributable to the total selling price of the house, but that the rate of increase in these two attributes is outweighed by the significant rise in land value. The trend in the cost of land for both cities showed a strong impact on the new housing price index. The study concluded that - compared to the cost of labour and materials, the main reason for the increase in house prices is primarily due to land costs. =Wealth inequalities have intensified= There are too many low-income households in Canada. One of the major causes of the affordable housing problem is the number of low-income households in Canada who are also subject to provincial and federal claw backs and tax backs, for example, on back to work and the federal-provincial National Child Benefit (NCB). A Toronto Dominion report (2003) recommended that government initiatives should be focused on raising market incomes at the lower end. This would be more effective than the inefficient, expensive, publicly funded expenditure-based or tax-based incentives to increase the number of affordable rental units. =Devolution of responsibility without corresponding funds to municipalities= In 2011 the Canadian Federation of Municipalities called for a resolution of the municipal fiscal imbalance with municipalities receiving less from the federal and provincial governments while their responsibilities, for affordable housing for example, increased. =Role of urban planners= American economist Edward L. Glaeser, who focuses on urban economics, argued that over zealous zoning by municipal land planers cause some of the problems of affordability of housing. They argued that dramatic differences in price of housing versus construction costs occurred in places where permits for new buildings had become difficult to obtain (since the 1970s). Compounded with strict zoning laws the supply of new housing in these cities was seriously disrupted. Real estate markets were thus unable to accommodate increases in demand, and housing prices skyrocketed. Vancouver's high-rise apartments helped defer urban sprawl, but it is argued, led to higher housing prices Glaeser and Gyourko argued that public policy should reflect the ways in which housing affordability differs from region to region, affecting classes differently. Public policies should reflect those differences. Removing municipal zoning restrictions would resolve some of the affordability issues faced by the middle class. They suggest federal government should provide incentives for local governments to allow for more construction. They argue that affluent families benefit most from mortgage interest deductions, allowing them to purchase an even larger home and they may drive prices even higher. Interest deductions, which are meant to make housing more affordable to the middle class, can lead to an increase in the amount families can pay for a house, driving up prices even higher. They question construction supply subsidies for low-income housing in areas that offer few employment possibilities. These subsidies discourage private-sector developers and benefit those with political connections. Direct income transfers for low income families would resolve their specific housing needs. Randal O'Toole of the Fraser Institute in his report entitled \\"Unliveable Strategies: The Greater Vancouver Regional District and the Liveable Region Strategic Plan\\" (2011) argued that the GVRD's land use planners \\"left the region with the least affordable housing and some of the worst traffic congestion in Canada\\". He concluded that Greater Vancouver Regional District planners' \\"Livable Region Strategic Plan\\" (1996) were too narrow in their focus on \\"avoiding urban sprawl and minimizing automobile driving.\\" He also argued that the protection of green spaces, farm lands, from development limited growth and was the cause of the escalation of prices. Consequences of the affordability problem =Health issues related to lack of affordability of housing= A Conference Board of Canada 2010 report entitled \\"Building From the Ground Up: Enhancing Affordable Housing in Canada\\" argued that the shortage of affordable housing was \\"having a detrimental effect on Canadians' health, which, in turn, reduces their productivity, limits our national competitiveness, and indirectly drives up the cost of health care and welfare.\\" Stress, asthma, and diabetes are connected to inadequate housing. Public policy and tools National Housing Strategy Until 2017, Canada was the only major country in the world, and the only G8 nation, that lacked a National Housing Strategy. Housing initiatives were introduced and funded by the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, along with civil society organizations (including the charitable sector). In 2016, the Canadian federal minister of families, children and social development said that strategies for a national affordable-housing strategy were being considered . In November, the federal government introduced Canada's National Housing Strategy which provides $40 billion of funding over 10 years and marks a significant shift in housing policy for the federal government. The Strategy includes building 100,000 new affordable units, repairing 300,000 affordable units and cutting homelessness by 50% . Affordable Housing Initiative (AHI) Affordable Housing Initiative (AHI) (2001‚Äì2011), an intergovernmental multilateral housing initiative on affordable housing was created. The federal government, working through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation provided funding for the supply of new affordable rental housing under the Affordable Housing Program was CAD$1 billion from 2001 to 2008 (to be matched by provinces and territories). There were promises to invest an additional CAD$1.9 billion from 2008 to 2013 for housing and homelessness programs for low-income Canadians. Affordable Housing Framework 2011‚Äì2014 Affordable Housing Framework 2011‚Äì2014 announced by the federal government in July 2011 in order to improve \\"access to affordable, sound, suitable and sustainable housing.\\" The Affordable Housing Framework acknowledges that a wide range of solutions are required to respond to the diversity of affordable housing program needs and priorities specific to each jurisdiction. Provinces and territories are reminded that it is their responsibility to design and deliver affordable housing programs, but they will have flexibility in how to invest federal funds (matched by provinces and territories) through programs and initiatives, as long as the overall intended outcome is reached: \\"to reduce the number of Canadians in housing need by improving access to affordable housing that is sound, suitable and sustainable... Initiatives under the Framework can include new construction, renovation, homeownership assistance, rent supplements, shelter allowances, and accommodations for victims of family violence.\\" Historical context of affordability of housing in Canada By 1996, the federal government revoked the Canada Assistance Plan of 1966, which made it mandatory that people whose income was inadequate to meet basic needs (including the working poor) have access to an established appeals procedures in the provinces and territories regarding social assistance. In the same year, the federal government transferred responsibility for most existing federal housing programmes to the provinces.\\" During the 1990s, there was a devolution of new responsibilities, including affordable housing, from provincial governments to municipal governments without adequate revenue tools. The TD report concluded that municipalities need a more sustainable funding arrangement, and provinces need to play a more active role in affordable housing, becoming leaders within the Affordable Housing Framework agreement. The 2006 Canadian federal budget \\"provided $300 million for affordable housing in the territories.\\" The 2009 Canadian federal budget allocated funds for the period covering (2009‚Äì2011): renovation and energy retrofits to social housing ($1 billion); to build housing for low-income seniors ($400 million); to build social housing for persons with disabilities ($75 million); to support social housing in the North ($200 million); low-cost loans to municipalities to improve housing-related infrastructure ($2 billion) as part of Canada's Economic Action Plan. There was a modest improvement in housing affordability across Canada in the third quarter of 2011 after two consecutive quarters of deterioration. Part of this was due to decreased costs in home ownership resulting from lower mortgage rates. Affordability by province Alberta President of the Canadian Home Builders' Association, Calgary Region, Carol Oxtoby explains the increase in luxury homes construction and sales in Calgary. With its oil and gas and high-tech industries, young entrepreneurs and head offices, Calgary has some of the highest income earners and highest personal wealth in Canada per capita. In 2011 \\"448 homes in Calgary were resold for more than $1 million.\\" Ontario The Housing Services Corporation (HSC) was created in January 2012 to replace the Social Housing Services Corporation (SHSC) as affordable housing needs evolved under the Housing Services Act. Housing Services Corporation \\"is a non-profit organization that delivers province-wide programs that benefit Ontario's affordable housing sector\\" The Social Housing Services Corporation (SHSC) was created by Province of Ontario in 2002 following the devolution of responsibility for over 270,000 social housing units from the province to the municipalities. Its mandate was to \\"provide Ontario housing providers and service managers with bulk purchasing, insurance, investment and information services that add significant value to their operations.\\" A 2010 survey by the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association revealed that the number of households on affordable housing waiting lists was at an \\"all-time high of 141,635\\" in 2010. Over twenty per cent of home owners residing in Ontario had housing affordability issues. British Columbia Vancouver had the least affordable housing market in Canada by 1980; the average home cost 5.7 times the average family income.Statistics Canada, 1983a, table 7; Statistics Canada, 1983b, table 19. O' Toole calculated that given the high interest rates in 1980, \\"an average family would have to devote more than 70 percent of its income to pay off a mortgage on an average home in 30 years.\\" According to a report in The Economist, a factor contributing to Vancouver's high property prices may be Canadian laws which enable foreigners to buy Canadian property‚Äîpossibly for purposes of tax evasion or money laundering‚Äîwhile shielding their identities from tax authorities, a practice which is known as snow washing. The governor of the Bank of Canada noted that affordability of housing has been eroded as wealthy Asian investors seeking diversification and hard assets purchase housing in Vancouver. Consequently, \\"[t]he average selling price of a home in Vancouver is now nearly 11 times the average Vancouver family's household income, a multiple similar to those seen in Hong Kong and Sydney‚Äîcities that have also become part of a more globalized real estate market.\\" There has been a move toward the integration of affordable social housing with market housing and other uses, such as the 2006‚Äì2010 redevelopment of the Woodward's building site in Vancouver. Woodward, a heritage site, was re-invented and has reinvigorated Gastown in Downtown Eastside, one of Vancouver's oldest and \\"most challenged\\" yet \\"resilient\\" communities. The project has also been said to contribute to Vancouver being an inclusive city. Randal O'Toole argued that the GVRD urban planners focused too much on housing affordability as a lack of affordable housing for low- income families who would need some form of housing subsidy. He noted that GVRD reports failed to mention that there was also a lack of affordable housing for people with middle incomes. Vancouver is the most stressed area in the province in terms of affordability of housing in Canada. In 2012, Vancouver was ranked by Demographia as the second-most unaffordable in the world, rated as even more severely unaffordable in 2012 than in 2011. The city has adopted various strategies to reduce housing costs, including cooperative housing, legalized secondary suites, increased density and smart growth. As of April 2010, the average two-level home in Vancouver sold for a record high of $987,500, compared with the Canadian average of $365,141. In June 2016, Generation Squeeze, a non-profit organization that advocates on behalf of young adults, labeled the situation in the province a crisis and commenced a \\"Code Red\\" campaign. On November Nov 22, 2016, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the BC government had approved expenditures for 2,900 affordable housing units amounting to 516 million dollars. The government has given approval to 68 projects with 1441 units going to Lower mainland and Fraser Valley, 774 units to Vancouver Island and Gulf Islands, 256 units to Thompson-Okanagan, and the rest to Coast, Kootenays, Cariboo, and North/Northeast. Nunavut The capital of Nunavut faces an extreme affordability challenge mainly due to the supply side. In 2010 Iqaluit had the most expensive rental market in Canada: a two-bedroom apartment cost $2,365 a month in Iqaluit compared to $1,195 in Vancouver. The Global Housing Services and Canadian Housing and Renewal Association The Global Housing Services and Canadian Housing and Renewal Association CHRA, a national non- profit association focuses on decent housing affordability for Canadians.  Department of Veteran Affairs  The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) had considers effective Global Housing project a fundamental Global project responsibility and vital to achieving the department's overall mission and objectives.

The film stars Caitlin Gerard, Melanie Papalia, Keith David, Shane Dawson, Andrew James Allen, Toby Turner, and Liza Weil. The film was released on October 12, 2012. Plot The plot revolves around the titular Smiley killer, the subject of an Internet myth. Supposedly, if a person on a Chatroulette-style website types the phrase \\"I did it for the lulz\\" three times, their chat partner will be murdered by a killer called Smiley (so named because he mutilated his own face by stitching his own eyes shut and carved his mouth into a smile) before they themselves are killed. A college student named Ashley (Gerard) becomes roommates with Proxy (Papalia). Ashley decides to go to a party where she meets Zane (Allen), Mark (Turner) and Binder (Dawson), who is mocked by his classmates for having reported a case of pedophilia, earning him the nickname Pedobear. One night Ashley and Proxy test out the Smiley myth with a random person online. After typing \\"I did it for the lulz\\" three times, to their horror, the stranger is murdered. Proxy convinces Ashley to stay silent. However, Ashley begins experiencing guilt over the stranger's death. She also begins to believe that Smiley is stalking her and intends to kill her; her friends and a psychiatrist write this off as anxious hallucinations and nightmares. Ashley eventually goes to the police; there she tries to convince them, to no avail, to investigate the murders caused by Smiley. The police dismiss her, implying that she is going crazy and quite possibly on the receiving end of a large, elaborate prank. When Proxy loses contact with Zane, she video chats Ashley in hysterics. Ashley goes to his house to check on him, only to find him shot dead with a handgun he purchased for self-defense. Instead of calling the police, Ashley picks up the gun and orders Proxy to type \\"I did it for the lulz\\" three times, hoping to ambush and kill Smiley. However, she accidentally shoots Binder, who had been coming over to check on her. Moments later, Smiley appears and slits Binder's throat. Ashley is then attacked by multiple Smileys, finally throwing herself out a window to her presumed death to escape them. It is then revealed that all Ashley's classmates, including Proxy, Binder, and the babysitter murdered in the opening, are all part of a fringe group of Anonymous. They created the Smiley myth as a large-scale prank, although they are satisfied with Ashley's death. Binder states that Smiley will likely live on long after them and inspire copycat killings. Later, Proxy is video-chatting with Zane, questioning their morality. Zane dismisses her worries and types \\"I did it for the lulz\\" three times as a joke. However, a real Smiley appears behind Proxy, kills her, and then waves at Zane via webcam. In a post-credits scene, Ashley is revealed to have survived her fall.

As he was producing the film himself, Smiley had a small budget and Gallagher was active in various different parts of the film such as advertising and seeking MPAA approval. Gallagher initially debated using stockings with a smiley face painted on it as Smiley's mask, but discarded the idea because it \\"just wasn't scary enough\\". He chose to go with the final mask after imagining a \\"guy who stitched an emoticon into his own face and thought, 'Wow, that's really creepy. Theatrical rights for the film were purchased by AMC Theatres who gave the film a limited screening on their independent platform on October 12, 2012. The film played in select AMC theaters throughout the United States, with fans able to request to host screenings of Smiley in their cities via Tugg. Reaction from 4chan and Anonymous Prior to the film's official theatrical release, Gallagher and his family began receiving threats from people alleging to be from 4chan and Anonymous. Personal information for Gallagher, his family, and anyone that had worked on Smiley was posted online with the recommendation that people use it to harass them. In an interview with Fearnet, Gallagher stated that the site had posted the information as part of \\"Operation Fuck Smiley\\" and that \\"Their goal was to spoil the end of the movie, post pornography and gore on any website that talks about it, rate the movie really low... it was this horrible vendetta, like they wanted to destroy it because we talked about 4chan in the movie.\\" The validity of these claims were questioned by Cole Strycker, author of Epic Win for Anonymous, who expressed suspicion that Gallagher was trying to use the death threats as a publicity stunt to promote the film. In response, Gallagher asserted that the death threats were real and were not being used as a publicity stunt. Reception The film received largely negative reviews and holds an 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on an average rating of 3.5/10 based on 22 reviews; several reviews called the film a \\"rip off\\" of Scream and Candyman. Criticism centered on claims of the film being \\"dull\\" or \\"generic\\", with additional criticisms over the acting performances and lack of originality. Smiley also received negative reviews from The A.V. Club and The New York Times. Bloody Disgusting panned the film, stating that the writers \\"took a strong, modern idea, over-thought it and turned it into a generic '90s movie that'll have you throwing popcorn at the screen\\". Variety called the film \\"uninspired\\", saying that \\"the mayhem here is neither especially gory nor suspenseful\\". Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times gave a more positive review, calling the film a \\"more or less satisfying low- key creeper\\". Olsen praised Gerard, Weil, David, and Bart's performances, but called the story-telling \\"repetitive\\".

He is remembered for his opposition to totalitarianism and for fatalistic works inspired by Catholic morality. Rostworowski was born in Rybna in southern Poland. He studied agriculture in Halle, but abandoned it in 1900. He began studying piano and composition at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1901, and moved to Berlin to study philosophy six years later. He returned to Poland in 1908 and settled in Czarkowy on the Nida. During World War I he moved to Krak√≥w and became a member of National Democracy, publishing in G≈Ços Narodu beginning in 1920. In 1933 he was chosen to join the Polish Academy of Literature, but resigned his membership in 1937 in protest against the change of government. Between 1934 and 1937 he had served as a councillor in the Krak√≥w municipal government on the platform of the National Party. He died in Krak√≥w. Artistic career Rostworowski had his first published work, a collection of decadent poems called Tandeta, released in 1901 (or 1911, sources vary). In 1907‚Äì1909 he published a four-volume series: Pre memoria, Maya, Ante lucis ortum, and Saeculum solutum. He published his first dramas between 1908 and 1911, including ≈ªeglarze (Sailors, 1908), Pod g√≥rƒô (Uphill, 1910), and Echo (1911). He became famous locally for his play Judasz z Kariothu (Judas of Kerioth, 1913), based on the New Testament and staged with the actor Ludwik Solski in the title role. His next widely discussed historical play, about the nature of tyranny, was Kajus Cezar Kaligula (1917), also with Solski. In 1920 he published Mi≈Çosierdzie (Mercy), and in 1922 the drama Straszne dzieci (Hollow Children), followed by Zmartwychwstanie (Resurrection, 1923) and Antychryst (1925), but these were not as highly regarded as his first plays. He spoke out against totalitarianism in Czerwony marsz (Red March, 1930), a morality play on guillotines and rolling heads based on the French Revolution and the Terror. Niespodzianka Rostworowski received rave reviews for his tragedy Niespodzianka (Surprise, 1928‚Äì1929), about parents murdering for money their own son, who had emigrated to America and returned to visit them. The work was staged at the Juliusz S≈Çowacki Theatre in 1929, and in 1932 won the national book prize. Niespodzianka was regarded as Rostworowski's most notable achievement by the Polish Nobel laureate Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz. The novel tells an old story, first recorded around the 17th century. A peasant family in financial despair is visited by a well-dressed man asking for lodgings. They kill him in his sleep to steal his belongings, but subsequently discover that he was their own son. Both parents suffer psychologically, and the money is given to their younger son to pay for his education. The story was staged by director Jan ≈öwiderski in Pozna≈Ñ in 1987. Rostworowski died in 1938 in Krak√≥w, and was buried at the Salwator estate cemetery. His strong Catholic ethics and a firm stance against totalitarianism caused his work to be disregarded in communist Poland and nearly forgotten. He was survived by three sons, Jan Rostworowski (poet, 1919‚Äì1975), Marek (art historian and minister of culture, 1921-1996) and Emanuel (also an historian, and editor-in-chief of the Polish Biographical Dictionary).s≈Çownik biograficzny (Polish Biographical Dictionary) official website.

The island is formed by sediments that are seasonally washed out from the mouths of Cow Creek and Bull Creek, which enter the Missouri River just upstream from Cow Island. The island is about 1.2 miles long and averages about 150 yards in width. It is located in extreme northern Fergus County, but lies across the river from extreme southern Blaine County, to its east. Cow Island was significant in Montana's pre- and early history period as a Missouri River ford, and during the segment of Montana territorial history from about the mid-1860s to the mid-1880s, when it was used as a trans-shipment point for freight going upstream by steamboat to Fort Benton Montana. Cow Island's historic significance is related to its geographic location. Access to the Missouri River was difficult along a 200-mile stretch of river, because the Missouri breaks form a barrier to travel on each side of the river. However, a travel route known as the Cow Island Trail went north from Cow Island up Cow Creek, by-passing the breaks and emerging onto the Montana plains. This outlet through the Missouri Breaks caused Cow Island to be utilized as a historic Missouri River ford in the Missouri Breaks area. Starting in the 1860s this access route also caused Cow Island to become a steamboat landing site from which freight was moved up Cow Creek on the Cow Island Trail to Fort Benton and other destinations. During the Nez Perce War in 1877 the Nez Perce forded the Missouri at Cow Island, and it became the site of the Battle of Cow Island.The upstream end of Cow Island in the Missouri River. View from site near mouth of Cow Creek. The Missouri Breaks south of Missouri River in background The Missouri Breaks To understand the historical significance of Cow Island, one has to first know the basic facts about the Missouri Breaks. The Missouri Breaks are steeply eroded badlands along the east-west trending Missouri River. The breaks extend along the river from below Fort Benton down to Fort Peck, a distance of over 200 miles. The breaks also reach out for miles into the prairie from both the south and north bank of the Missouri River. The breaks are so difficult to access that this stretch of the Missouri River is still one of the most remote and untouched areas of Montana. The breaks were formed during the last ice age, when a continental ice sheet extended down from Canada, and blocked off the previous drainage of the Missouri. The ice sheet backed water up into a large lake that filled a basin where Great Falls is now located. The rising lake waters finally broke out from the ice dam. As the lake waters rushed out, they carved a new river channel for the Missouri along the edge of the existing continental ice sheet. This sudden erosive action cut out the current channel of the river from below present Fort Benton, to the present Fort Peck Dam. This new channel was cut into soft Cretaceous age sedimentary rock, and tributaries then eroded down to the Missouri from each side. The tributaries were quickly carved by water erosion into the same soft Cretaceous age layers on both sides of the new river channel, thus creating the steeply eroded badlands known as the Missouri Breaks. The Missouri River ford at Cow Island After the close of the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago, Cow Island was the site of a much used ford on the Missouri River, in the Missouri Breaks area. It was used by migratory buffalo herds and by bands of native people who foraged and hunted on the Montana prairies north and south of the Missouri River. For over 100 miles east and west from Cow Island the Missouri Breaks border the river. The badlands topography in the breaks make the river difficult to reach, and thus restrict access to the river. Animals and people could get down to the river at Cow Island by traveling along Cow Creek. Cow Creek provided a 25-mile-long route of travel from the northern plains to the river. This route to the river by-passed the rough topography of the breaks. Once the river was reached, Cow Island divided the broad Missouri River into two channels, making the river easier to ford. South from Cow Island a steep but relatively short four mile trail led through the breaks to the central Montana grasslands. Cow Island is not the only ford in this area of the breaks, but it is the Missouri ford that was easier to approach compared with than other fords in the breaks area. The Steamboat Landing at Cow Island Bertrand, which sank on April 1, 1865, while heading up the Missouri for Fort Benton, Montana Territory Cow Island was used as a steamboat landing from about the early 1860s to late 1880s. During this approximately 20-year period, freight was transported to the Montana gold fields by Missouri River steamboat.The Conquest of the Missouri, Being the Story of the Life and Exploits of Captain Grant Marsh, Joseph Mills Hanson, Chicago, A.C. McClurg & Co. 1909, p. 60‚Äì68. The destination of the steamboats was Fort Benton at the upper limit of steamboat navigation on the Missouri. In mid to late summer river volumes went into seasonal decline. The river became shallower, and heavier draft steamboats could not pass a series of rapids above Cow Island, specifically the Dauphine Rapids, and thus steamboats could not reach the upriver port of Fort Benton. Steamboats had to offload their freight at a downstream landing in the Missouri Breaks. A common landing site in the breaks was at Cow Island, because the offloaded freight could then be taken overland to Fort Benton using a travel route up Cow Creek. Cow Creek was one of the few routes by which freight wagons could get from the river, up through the breaks, to the plains. Using Cow Creek as a travel route, freight could be moved overland from Cow Island landing on the river through the Missouri breaks onto the Montana prairie and on to Fort Benton. On some years when there was not a severe decline in the levels of the Missouri in the late summer, steamboats did not have to offload at Cow Island. On other years, when the river fell drastically every steamboat had to offload there. Because of this seasonal variability no permanent community was established at Cow Island landing. Shipping freight to Ft. Benton was very lucrative. Therefore, the freight that was offloaded did not stay long at Cow Island landing before it was loaded onto freight wagons and taken up Cow Island trail to be sold at Fort Benton. Because of this swift transfer of freight during the late summer and fall, the freight was simply tarped, after it was offloaded, and no freight storage buildings were ever constructed. Cow Island ceased to be a steamboat landing when the railroads came to Ft. Benton in the late 1880s. Cow Island landing's twenty-year run as a transhipment point on a busy artery of commerce was over. The Cow Island Trail View up Cow Creek, where the Cow Creek Trail ran. Note how the creek bottom provides access through the breaks.The wagon road that started at Cow Island Landing and went up Cow Creek was known as the Cow Island Trail. After traversing the breaks, the freight road extended up onto the Montana prairie, from whence it ran on to Ft. Benton. The tons of freight dropped off by steamboats at Cow Island Landing were carried up this trail in large covered wagons, sometimes hitched in tandem and pulled by 6 to 12 span of oxen or mules. The probable path of the Cow Island Trail was up Cow Creek for about , then up Davidson Coulee ridge, then west into the plains and on to Ft. Benton. As Cow Creek flows down its valley bottom, it meanders from one precipitous sidewall to the other. While traveling up Cow Creek freight wagons crossed Cow Creek 31 times. The usual outfit was two wagons and several spans of mules, horses or oxen. Mules and oxen could pull more weight than horses, but freighters favored oxen over mules to pull the wagons. Indians would steal mules and horses, but would not steal the oxen. The climb out of Cow Creek, up Davidson Coulee ridge was steep and the road was narrow. Freighters would separate the wagons and then \\"double team\\" each wagon to the top of the grade. Accounts exist of wagons that were inexpertly handled dropping a wheel off the grade and then rolling off the road, taking the team with them to the bottom of the grade. The Charles Russell painting, \\"The Wagon Boss\\" depicts freight wagons being pulled up a steep grade by a long span of oxen. The footnoted source shows a picture of this painting.Charles Russell Painting, \\"The Wagon Boss\\", watermarked, for sale by source A \\"bull whacker\\" is guiding the teams with a long whip mounted on a pole. The span of oxen are having to swing wide to bring the wagons along the track in the extreme foreground of the painting. The wagon boss waits on his horse for the team at the top of the grade. A whip is coiled around his neck. In the background is the community of Ft. Benton, confirmed by the adobe fort among the buildings along the Missouri River. The freight on the wagons depicted in the painting has arrived at Fort Benton, either by steamboat, or by freight from Cow Island, and is being freighted on to Helena. While the wagons are shown in the Fort Benton area, the same type of wagons were used to bring freight up the Cow Island trail from Cow Island landing to Fort Benton. After railroads supplanted the steamboat, Cow Island landing ceased to be used as a transhipment point for freight, and the traffic died away on the Cow Island Trail. Today the name Cow Island Trail is attached to a gravel/dirt road that covers part of the original freight route between Cow Island landing and Ft. Benton. The gravel road known as the Cow Island Trail goes east and west south of the Bear Paw Mountains; the western end is the Judith Landing Road, and the eastern end is at Cow Creek itself at a point about 15 miles upstream from the mouth of Cow Creek on the Missouri. This last 15 mile segment of the old trail down Cow Creek to the Missouri is unused today, although faint traces of the original route can be seen on the ground. On this stretch of the old Cow Island Trail the creek crossings have washed out and today this part of the original route is difficult if not impossible to traverse by vehicle. The Battle of Cow Island, and later events with the Nez Perce on Cow Creek Cow Island was the site of the Battle of Cow Island on September 23, 1877.Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The US Army and the Nee-Me-Poo Crises, Jerome A. Greene and Alvin M. Josephy, 2000, Montana Historical Society Press, , p. 234‚Äì243 The Nez Perce were fleeing from pursuing Army units toward Canada. They crossed the Missouri at the Cow Island ford on September 23. At the Cow Island landing a small detachment of soldiers were guarding government and private goods offloaded from steamboats and awaiting overland passage to Fort Benton. The Nez Perce crossed the Missouri in the area of the Cow Island Ford in an orderly and organized manner. The soldiers had retreated into shallow entrenchments around their camp. The Nez Perce numbered about 300; the soldiers had a dozen men, and four civilians. Although the Nez Perce vastly outnumbered the soldiers, they passed them by without incident, and camped further up Cow Creek. Later in the day, a delegation of the Nez Perce returned to the entrenched detachment and made a peaceful but urgent request, begging for food supplies from the sergeant in charge of the detachment. The sergeant only responded with a tiny parcel of food. The weaknesses of the army detachment were many. They had only a tiny handful of soldiers; their camp was poorly entrenched; their position in the river bottom could be fired on from the adjacent bluffs in the breaks, and (most importantly) their camp was separated by a significant distance from the tons of freight stacked against the bluffs, which they were supposed to guard. The Nez Perce took brilliant advantage of these weaknesses. As darkness fell, Nez Perce warriors fired on the entrenched soldiers from the bluffs. While the army unit was thus pinned down behind their shallow entrenchments, the Nez Perce broke into the freight storage area under cover of night and took what they wanted. The next day, the Nez Perce moved up Cow Creek, but on September 25, 1877, they again engaged in a rear guard action in what is sometimes referred to as the Battle of Cow Creek Canyon, repulsing a pursuing army unit under command of Major Igles. On the same day, they ransacked and then burned a freight wagon train they overtook on the Cow Creek trail. Further up Cow Creek the Nez Perce held a council. Thinking they had now outdistanced their pursuers, they made a fateful decision to stop to rest, which they did a few days later, when east of the Bear Paw mountains. This delay allowed Gen. Nelson A. Miles to catch up to the Nez Perce with fresh army units from Ft. Keogh, Montana. In the ensuing five-day Battle of Bear Paw (September 30 to October 5, 1877) the Nez Perce were surrounded and decimated leading to Chief Joseph's famous surrender speech to Generals Howard and Miles. Cow Island today The advance of technology has removed Cow Island's significance as a Missouri River ford. Cow Island is no longer on a route of travel. The buffalo herds and the foraging bands of nomadic people are long gone. Railroads spelled the end of steamboat traffic on the Missouri, and Cow Island ceased to be a transhipment point on a route of commerce. Modern travel routes go elsewhere to traverse the breaks; U.S. Route 191, the only highway through the breaks area, crosses the river some 20 miles downstream on the Fred Robinson Bridge. Cow Island is now included in the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument, which is under management of the Bureau of Land Management. The Cow Creek area of the Missouri Breaks is currently being evaluated for Prairie Wilderness status. U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Special Places in the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument Cow Island has reverted to just another distant spot in one of the more remote areas of Montana. Deserted homestead buildings on the bottoms of Cow Creek and adjacent Bull Creek attest to the difficulty of agricultural pursuits in this remote area. Access to Cow Island today is difficult. A BLM dirt road approaches from the east along ridge tops. It drops off the ridges to reach Bull Creek, and then the mouth of Cow Creek, which is just upstream from Cow Island. The latter part of this road is steep and not maintained. It is rutted and has washouts. This road is absolutely impassable in wet weather.

Facts James Buist, a farmer in Saskatchewan, borrowed money from the Innovation Credit Union in October 1991. In return, he provided the credit union with a security interest in all of his present and after-acquired personal property, which would be governed by the Personal Property Security Act (Saskatchewan). The interest was not entered into Saskatchewan's PPSA registry until June 2004. After this loan was provided, Buist also borrowed money from the Bank of Montreal, and several security agreements were executed between 1998 and January 2004. Buist did not disclose to the bank the loan from the credit union or its security interest, and, as it had not been registered, its existence did not appear in searches of the PPSA and Bank Act registries. The Bank's security interest was registered under the Bank Act, and the PPSA in Saskatchewan does not allow parallel registration of such interests in its registry. Buist ultimately became insolvent, and the Bank seized some of his property that was covered by its security in December 2004. The credit union applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan for a declaration that it had a priority claim over the proceeds of the disposition of that property. The issue Was a registered security interest under the Bank Act able to defeat an unregistered security interest that operated under provincial legislation? The judgments below The Court of Queen's Bench ruled that the Bank Act had priority by virtue of the Bank having perfected its security interest. As the judge (T.C. Zarzeczny J.) noted, This ruling was reversed on appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. In a unanimous decision (per Jackson, J.A.), the court stated, Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada The appellate decision was upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court. While it generally agreed with that decision, the court detailed what it felt to be the correct reasoning in arriving at the result. The Saskatchewan CA had relied on its previous decision in Royal Bank of Canada v. Agricultural Credit Corp. of Saskatchewan, which had laid down some basic rules for resolving priority issues: :# set aside the PPSA from the analysis and determine the priority as if the PPSA did not exist; :# determine the priority pursuant to [applicable provisions of the Bank Act] to the extent it is possible to do so; :# where appropriate, apply the first-in-time priority rule. The SCC stated that, while this approach did not lead the Court of Appeal into error in deciding this case, this formulation does not accurately reflect the applicable constitutional principles at play. Step 2 is correct, but Step 1 properly means that internal priority rules of the PPSA have no bearing on determining a priority dispute between Bank Act and PPSA security interests. However, the PPSA retains importance in resolving the priority dispute at issue: :* As the SCC held in Bank of Montreal v. Hall, the Bank Act security provisions are valid federal legislation which cannot be subject to the operation of provincially enacted priority provisions. :* Thus, where the Bank Act contains an express priority provision that is applicable to a particular priority dispute, that provision will govern. :* In determining what interest the debtor may have already conveyed to another creditor and, in such circumstances, what interest he or she had left to convey to the bank at the time of execution of the Bank Act security agreement, it becomes necessary to resort to the provincial property law, either at common law or under applicable provincial statutes. It is at this point that resorting to the PPSA becomes relevant. :* It is true that the internal priority rules of the PPSA cannot be invoked to resolve the dispute. However, it does not follow that the provincial security interest created under the PPSA does not exist outside these priority rules. Nor can the fundamental changes brought about by the PPSA be ignored in determining the nature of the prior competing interest. Far from being irrelevant under the Bank Act, provincial property law plays a complementary role in defining the rights granted under the Bank Act. :* A PPSA security interest, just as a Bank Act security interest, is a statutorily created interest and, as such, an interest recognized at law. :* Having a PPSA security interest in collateral does not give a creditor full right and title to the collateral. Rather, a PPSA security interest gives the secured creditor an interest in the property to the extent of the debtor's obligation. As noted by the Court: Significance This decision has reinforced requirements for banks to practice due diligence in lending to prospective borrowers. They will also need to consider in which cases PPSA registration will be preferable to that under the Bank Act. In response to this decision, the Parliament of Canada has amended the Bank Act to explicitly state that registry under its provisions will also take priority over unperfected security interests, except where a bank is already aware of their existence. Royal assent was given on 29 March 2012, and the relevant provisions came into force on 24 May 2012.

Early years Arnot was born in Glasgow, Scotland on 12 September 1858. His family lived in the town of Hamilton, southeast of Glasgow, for several years. There he became close to his neighbors, the family of the medical missionary David Livingstone. He looked up to Livingstone as a hero and determined to emulate him. He felt practical skills would be needed in his future missionary career. At fourteen he left school to become an apprentice joiner in the Glasgow shipyards. Arnot was brought up in the Church of Scotland, but became a member of the Plymouth Brethren. First expedition In July 1881, aged 22, Arnot embarked for Cape Town. He was not associated with a missionary board, although in his work he was always glad to cooperate with those who were. He aimed to find a region in the interior that would be healthy for Europeans. They could train the local Africans in the Christian religion, and these Africans could in turn act as missionaries in the less healthy regions. Arnot traveled by coastal steamer to Durban. In August 1881 he left for the interior, traveling slowly through the Transvaal to Shoshong in Botswana where he was welcomed by King Kama, who had been converted to Christianity. Arnot arrived in Shoshong on 11 March 1882. There he met the missionary J.D. Hepburn and observed him at work. He called Hepburn \\"a faithful man, who sought the conversion not only of the natives of the tribe but also of every man who passed through Shoshong white or black\\". Southern Central Africa around 1880, showing the main interior trade routes. Msiri's kingdom is in the center of the map. After a three-month stay Arnot continued northward across the Kalahari Desert to the Barotse kingdom, in what is now western Zambia. In December 1882 he reached Lealui, the capital. Arnot was present when the Lozi King Lewanika received a proposal from the Ndebele for an alliance to resist the white men. Arnot may have helped Lewanika to see the advantages of a British protectorate in terms of the greater wealth and security it would provide. Lewanika kept him here for the next eighteen months. Arnot left Bulozi in 1884 to seek medical attention and to escape a brewing rebellion against Lewanika. He had to travel westward rather than to the east as he had planned. His route took him over the height of land between the watersheds of the Zambezi and the Congo, where he found the source of the Zambezi. He identified Kalene Hill as a particularly suitable place for a mission. At the location was cool and relatively free of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Located in the British territory of Northern Rhodesia, from the summit one could see far into Angola and the Congo Free State. Arnot was assisted in reaching the Bi√© Plateau in Angola by the Portuguese trader and army officer Ant√≥nio da Silva Porto. Despite his illness, he refused to be carried in a hammock by African porters, insisting on riding an ox. The journey was arduous, through rough country and with constant exposure to accidents and unfamiliar disease. Arnot eventually reached Benguela on the Atlantic coast in Portuguese territory around the end of 1884. It had taken him four years to cross the continent from east to west. Msiri Arnot recovered his health while staying at Bailundu, inland from the coast in Ovimbundu territory, as the guest of some missionaries from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Messengers arrived there from the chief Msidi (Msiri), who ruled a large area in what is now Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with its capital at Bunkeya. Msiri invited the white men to visit his Garenganze kingdom. On 3 June 1885 Arnot set out with a caravan of forty bearers and supplies for two years, reaching Bunkeya on 14 February 1886. When Arnot arrived he had no food left, no trade goods and no white companions. He received a warm welcome, however, although Msiri discouraged his missionary work for fear it would make his subjects disloyal. Msiri's father had been in the business of buying copper ore in Katanga and transporting it to the east coast of Africa for resale. As a young man Msiri remained behind in the region as his father's agent. He became leader of a group of Bayeke people, and established a state that extended from the Luapula River south to the Congo-Zambezi watershed, and from Lake Mweru in the east to the Lualaba River in the west. Based on Bunkeya, the state controlled a huge central-African trading network, mostly dealing in slaves but also in ivory, salt, copper and iron ore. Traders came to Bunkeya from the Zambezi and Congo basins, from Angola, Uganda and Zanzibar. The Arabs from the east coast bought guns and ammunition, which Msiri used to maintain his position. Msiri's boma (compound) at Bunkeya. The objects on top of the four poles, below which some of Msiri's warriors are gathered, are heads of his enemies. More skulls are on the stakes forming the stockade. An unsympathetic report written in 1890 said: \\"There is the Garangange kingdom of M'sidi, where Mr. F.S. Arnot, 'the young Livingstone,' and his friends are trying to found a mission. This country is picturesque and salubrious, consisting of highlands to the west of Lake Bangweolo. M'sidi is, though a perfect savage, one of the most powerful monarchs of that part of Africa. He is a cruel despot, who governs by means of 2,000 fusileers, whom he has trained and armed, and whom he employs on marauding expeditions. His own palace is surrounded by human skulls ... The celebrated Katanga copper mines are in his dominions...\\" Msiri's rule was harsh but Arnot managed to establish a relationship of mutual respect. He said: \\"Msidi is a thorough gentleman. The other day he told one of his courtiers that he had one true friend and that was 'Monare,' for in his heart he did not find one single suspicion of me and I feel much the same toward Msidi. I have no suspicion of his friendship; he most carefully avoids asking anything of me\\". Arnot was allowed to build a mission with a church, school, clinic and orphanage and began to teach the children to read and write. He was the only European in Garanganze from January 1886 until December 1887. He was then joined by Charles Swan and William Henry Faulknor, two other missionaries. Arnot left the mission in their hands in February 1888 and reached England on 18 September 1888 after an absence of over seven years. Later career Arnot had become well-known from reports of his travels and work. In London he was invited to read a paper on the source of the Zambezi to the Royal Geographical Society, and he was made a fellow of this society. Arnot continued to organize missionaries, both male and female, over the next decade, establishing a string of missions from the Atlantic coast in Angola to Garenganze. Maintaining these posts involved delicate arrangements with the Belgian and Portuguese colonial authorities and with the local African traders and chiefs. Arnot's missionaries had high mortality. He wrote later that the route to the interior was marked by a chain of graves. It is probable that he felt these graves established a form of moral claim on the territory. Early in 1889 Arnot returned to Africa accompanied by thirteen recruits. These included his wife Harriet Jane Fisher, whom he had married in March of that year. Despite invitations from Msiri, Arnot's poor health meant he could not risk the grueling journey to Bunkeya. Instead, he and his wife remained in what is now eastern Angola. In 1892 Arnot went back to England, living for the next two years in the port of Liverpool where he oversaw the shipment of goods to the missions in Africa. He returned to Katanga in 1894, this time traveling from the east coast. His route took him up the lower Zambezi River, north through Lake Malawi and then west via lakes Tanganyika and Mweru. Recurring health problems forced Arnot to return from Katanga after only a few weeks. However, in later years he made further expeditions into what are now Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Many of the missions he established then are still active. Arnot became seriously ill on a trip in 1914 to what is now northwest Zambia, and was carried back to Johannesburg. He died there on 14 May 1914. In his time, Arnot was known as \\"the knight of Africa\\". Arnot's son Nigel and daughter Winifred also became missionaries, working at the Kalunda mission in Angola.

Through the text, the Council, noting with serious concern the lack of progress with regard to the implementation of the financial measures imposed by resolution 1532 (2004), demanded the Government of Liberia make all efforts necessary to fulfil its obligations. In requesting the panel‚Äôs reappointment, it tasked it with, among others, conducting two follow-up assessment missions to Liberia and neighbouring States to investigate and compile reports on the implementation, and any violations, of the arms ban and financing sources, such as from natural resources, for the illicit weapons trade; and assisting the sanctions committee in updating the publicly available reasons for listing entries on the travel ban and assets freeze lists. By a further provision, the Council reaffirmed the need for the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and the United Nations Operation in C√¥te d'Ivoire (UNOCI) to coordinate their strategies and operations in areas near the Liberian-C√¥te d'Ivoire border, in order to contribute to subregional security.Security Council Renews for 12 Months Arms, Travel Bans Concerning Liberia, Unanimously Adopting Resolution 2025 (2011)  See also  *List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2001 to 2100  References   External links  *Full text of UNSCR 2025 2011 United Nations Security Council resolutions United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Liberia 2011 in Liberia December 2011 events ","title":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 2025"},{"id":"34059804","text":"Ioannis Konstantinidis Ioannis Constantinidis (Greek: ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ), also known by the pen name Kostas Giannidis () (21 August 1903 ‚Äì 17 January 1984) was a Greek composer, pianist and conductor.Nina-Maria Jaklitsch Manolis Kalomiris (1883‚Äì1962), Nikos Skalkottas (1904‚Äì1949): Griechische Kunstmusik zwischen Nationalschule und Moderne, 2003, page 304: \\"...bildete Giannis Konstantinidis (ŒìŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ, 1903-1984), der mit Skalkottas schon seit dessen Berliner Jahren bekannt war, und der unter dem Pseudonym Kostas Giannidis in Athen Operetten, Revuen, Film- und Unterhaltung...\\" Constantinidis was born in Smyrna (today Izmir) in 1903.

It was directed by John Riggi, and written by series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey and Tracey Wigfield. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on January 12, 2012. Guest stars in this episode include John McEnroe, Tituss Burgess and the New York Liberty Timeless Torches dance team. In the episode, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) enjoys her new cultural relevance as a judge on a reality show; Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) struggles to reconcile the way the show ridicules children with his status as a father; Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) investigate why Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is in such an uncharacteristically good mood; and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) awaits the rapture while the others ridicule him. Before the airing, NBC moved the program to a new timeslot at 8:00 p.m., moving it from its 10:00 p.m. slot. This episode of 30 Rock received generally positive reviews from television critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 4.47 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 1.8 rating/5 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot NBC's new reality show, America's Kidz Got Singing, features small children participating in a singing contest. Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is delighted with her new infamy as the judge that humiliates all of the children after their performances. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is delighted with the show's high ratings, but as a new father feels guilty about mistreatment of the children. After a disastrous attempt to change Jenna's behavior on the show, Jack confers with his one-year-old daughter, and willfully misinterprets Liddy's first word, \\"mommy,\\" as \\"money,\\" an indication of her desire to continue with the show as-is. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is in an unusually good mood after the holiday break, showing good humor and refusing to overreact to the shenanigans of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan). This alarms all of her coworkers. Tracy investigates, and observes her picking up unspecified pills from a man on the street near Penn Station. He concludes that she is a \\"crack whore\\" and takes his evidence to Jack. Jack and Tracy discover that Liz is dancing for the Timeless Torches WNBA dance team. Jack confronts her after a performance and gloats over his complete knowledge of Liz. He then drops her off at a movie theater, and is shocked to secretly observe her meeting up with a man with whom she is evidently in a secret relationship. Finally, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) spends the day doing all the chores around the office that he had always fantasized about doing, after his pastor predicts that the Rapture is coming the next day. The TGS writers are highly amused and tease him mercilessly, even playing along and pretending to have seen signs of the rapture's approach. However, when the rapture doesn't occur, Kenneth is disappointed, so the writers take pity on him (at first unsuccessfully trying to convince him that the Rapture is actually happening) and take him to Coney Island to see the ocean, which he had admitted to never seeing before. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 4.47 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 1.8 rating/5 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.8 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was a decrease from the previous season premiere (5.85 million), but an increase from the previous episode, the fifth season finale (4.20 million). The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Nathan Rabin, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B+ grade and opined that \\"If the writers-razzing-Kenneth plot felt groaningly familiar it was refreshing to see how Jack‚Äôs new conscience as a father complicates his shark-like instincts and the sequence at the WNBA radiated a weird kind of nerdy, unabashed joy\\". Rabin complimented the direction for Liz and concluded \\"there‚Äôs a whole lot of life‚Äîor at least one more really solid season‚Äîleft in these characters after all.\\" Kevin Fitzpatrick of TV Over Mind also commented favourably, commenting \\"while its humor remains as sharp as ever, 30 Rock can acknowledge its aging formula, and even grow into new status quo organically\\" but wondered where the series would go hereafter.\\" James Poniewozik for Time commented favourably on the direction the writers had taken Liz in, noting that \\"it makes sense that a woman who‚Äôs had success in her career and has dated guys who look like Matt Damon and Jon Hamm would be able to move past neurotic self-flagellation and enjoy what objectively looks like a pretty sweet (if demanding) life\\", though he commented that he expected the storyline to be discarded shortly. Kaili Markley of The Game Effect opined that the episode had been \\"pulling all the stops. There was literally a hilarious line at least once every 30 seconds, and the episode had all of the classic elements that have always made 30 Rock work so well: sharp writing, hilarious jokes, Tracy and Jenna drama, the intricacies of the Jack-Liz dynamic, Liz Lemon weirdness, and Kenneth being Kenneth\\". She gave it an 8.7 out of 10.

Its clients are primarily broadcasters, multi-service operators, and digital publishers. Yospace is based in Staines outside London along with many other technology businesses in the so-called M4 corridor.  Company history   SmartPhone Emulator  Yospace was founded in 1999,. Its first product, the SmartPhone Emulator, released in April 2000, was a WAP handset emulator of the Nokia 7110. The product was unique at the time as it was the only solution available to developers that provided an accurate rendering of the handset display. The SmartPhone Emulator was released as a downloadable developer tool and an applet that could be embedded into a web page. The developer tool allowed simultaneous display of a variety of different handsets including those from Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola.  User-generated video communities  In 2005 Yospace launched a user-generated video community called SeeMeTV in partnership with the mobile operator 3 in the UK, which was launched shortly after as LookAtMe! on the O2 network in the UK. BeOnTV followed on T-Mobile in 2007. The services offered a means for subscribers to send in videos and pictures via MMS into a moderated gallery from which other community members could download and rate the entries. The service charged for video downloads and paid a percentage of the revenue back to the contributors via PayPal. By March 2006, the operator 3 claimed that over ¬£100,000 had been paid back to contributors. The company won numerous awards including being voted Number 1 in ‚ÄúReal Business' Top 50 Companies to Watch in Mobile‚Äô, and winning ‚ÄòMobile Innovation Award 2006‚Äô from the Mobile Entertainment Forum. The services since combined into a single community under the name EyeVibe. Yospace sold the service to Australian company Moko.mobi in 2010.

In March 2009, as part of Bauer Media's strategy review, it sold its interest in Yospace to private investors for ¬£1. During the period under Bauer ownership, Yospace launched yospaceCDS, a SaaS version of the video technology it had been developing for its own consumer services as a platform for digital publishers, media production houses and software developers alike to take video content out to mobile devices.

The total length of the creek is about and has an elevation of . Johnny Creek is part of the Ottawa River drainage basin, a large area covering much of eastern Ontario and western Quebec where water drains into the Ottawa River. After Johnny Creek flows into Net Lake, the water drains through Net Creek, entering Cassels Lake. It then enters Rabbit Lake, which is drained by the Matabitchuan River. The Matabitchuan River then flows into Lake Timiskaming where the water eventually enters the Ottawa River. Geology The floodplain of Johnny Creek is in a low lying trend associated with the Link Lake Deformation Zone. This zone of deformation is at least wide and over long, extending from Link Lake in the west to east of Highway 11. Several small shear zones paralleling the Johnny Creek floodplain are probably related to the Link Lake Deformation Zone. A diorite dike, thought to have been associated with volcanic activity, is crosscut by these minor shear zones. This indicates that the dike intruded into the surrounding country rock at least prior to the latest reactivation of the Link Lake Deformation Zone. However, the amount of displacement along the deformation zone is unknown.

It is the oldest surviving psalter used at Westminster Abbey, and is presumed to have left Westminster after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It joined the Old Royal Library as part of the collection of John Theyer, bought by Charles II of England in 1678. Both campaigns of decoration, both the illuminations of the original and the interpolated full-page drawings, are important examples of English manuscript painting from their respective periods. Description The manuscript has 224 medieval folios with a page size of 230 x 155 mm and a typical text area of 160 x 95. The binding is modern, from 1932. The contents begin with a calendar, illustrated with the signs of the Zodiac in small roundels (ff. 4r-10v), with Scorpio as a dragon. Then follow five full-page miniatures with gold grounds, showing: the Annunciation, Visitation, seated Virgin and Child, Christ in Majesty surrounded by the Evangelists' Symbols, and King David playing his harp (ff 12v-14v). David faces the large Beatus initial (f 15r) that begins the text of the Latin Book of Psalms, which includes three scenes from the life of David along the stem of the \\"B\\": David beheading Goliath, bringing his head to Saul, and harping, crowned as king. This occupies about two thirds of the page. The usual ten English sections into which the psalms are divided are marked by smaller decorated initials, some historiated with figures. These mark the start of Psalms 26 (f 38v), 38 (f 53r), 51 (f 66), 51 and 52 (f 66r and v), 68 with Jonah thrown off his ship, and riding on the whale (f 80v), 80 (f 98r), 97 (f 114r), 101 with Christ in the initial, and a kneeling monk below it with a scroll reading \\"Lord hear my prayer\\" (f 116), and 109 with the Trinity (f 132). The initials at the start of the other psalms are in coloured ink of red, green and blue, with decoration. Some of the decorative line-fillers have animal heads. The psalms are followed by the Litany, with the royal saint Edward the Confessor, who rebuilt Westminster Abbey, written in gold on f 182 (as he was in the calendar at f 5), and special prayers for Edward and Saint Peter, the abbey's dedicatee.Morgan, 49-50; BLC King David playing the harp at the beginning of the Psalms, f 14v In about 1250 five tinted full-page drawings were added on previously blank pages (ff 219v-221v). These show: a king and a kneeling knight on facing pages, Saint Christopher carrying the Christ-Child, an archbishop, and finally the head of Christ in a format associated with images of the Veil of Veronica, with a prayer below referring to that relic. There were later additions of prayers and antiphons up to the 15th century, including a late 14th or 15th century drawing of a naked man.BLC, Royal, 118 History The manuscript is presumed to have been commissioned for Westminster Abbey by the monk who is shown at folio 116 (see above), who was perhaps William Postard, abbot from 1191 to 1200, or Ralph de Arundel, abbot from 1200 until \\"he was deposed for high-handedness\\" in 1214. According to one scholar, the calendar reflects changes \\"upgrading\\" some feasts that were introduced by Ralph as abbot, in terms of the markings reflecting the number of lessons to be read and copes to be worn, though stylistically a date as early as the 1180s would be possible.Pfaff, 231 (quoted), who analyses the calendar; Royal, 118; Morgan, 50 The pattern of additions suggest it remained in use for services from its creation until the monastery was dissolved in 1540, and it appears in an inventory made in 1388 of the contents of the vestry, including 17 books used in services, as opposed to those in the library of the monastery,Pfaff, 229; Royal, 118 as well as another inventory of 1540.Morgan, 50 Like many monastic books, its history then becomes unclear for a period, before it reappears in the collection of the antiquarian bibliophile John Theyer (1597-1673), who made some notes in the book. After his death his collection was bought via the London bookseller Robert Scott for the Old Royal Library, which itself was given by George II to the newly founded British Museum in 1757.Morgan, 50; Royal, 81 Recent writers such as Nigel Morgan are confident that all the 13th century illustration was produced in London, although the earlier full-page miniatures are by an itinerant master, which is reflected in Deirdre Jackson's catalogue entry for the British Library's 2011/12 Royal Manuscripts exhibition. However Janet Backhouse, then Curator of Illuminated Manuscripts at the British Library, described the prefatory miniatures as \\"England, possibly St Albans or Winchester\\" in a book of 1997, and the BL website used a similar formula in late 2011, though assigning the tinted drawings to \\"Westminster\\". Since the prefatory full-page miniatures are in a separate gathering their production may not necessarily have coincided exactly with that of the initials as regards either time or place, and they were \\"almost certainly created independently before being bound into the book\\".Morgan, 50; Royal, 118 (quoted); Backhouse, 69; BLC; Thomson, 61 The clear and detailed depiction of the costumes of the figures in the tinted drawings has been discussed and copied in works on the history of costume since the late 18th century; in particular the sleeveless open-seam surcoat worn over chain mail of the kneeling knight is often used as an example of this innovation from the Islamic world.BLC bibliography; Snyder, 84 Style of the miniatures Christ in Majesty, with the Evangelists' Symbols, f 14r Nigel Morgan was the first to distinguish a total of five hands in the decoration, three in the original campaign around 1200, one around 1250 and the last (naked man) later. The first artist did the roundels in the calendar, the Beatus initial, and the other figured initials, except for that with the monk on f 116, which was done by another artist. Between them these two were presumably responsible for the other decorated initials and text embellishments. These may well have been monks at Westminster, whereas the full-page prefatory miniatures were done by an artist of higher quality, who may well have been an \\"itinerant lay professional\\", as his work is also found in the initials in a bible made at St Albans Abbey, now at Trinity College, Cambridge (MS B. 5.3). His style is influenced by the artists responsible for the later work on the Winchester Bible, who are also thought to be responsible for the wall paintings in the chapter-house at Sigena in northern Spain, and those in the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre in Winchester Cathedral.Royal, 118 (quoted); Morgan, 50, and no. 3, 51 for the Cambridge MS; Thomson, 61 on St Albans connections The miniatures are on the cusp of Romanesque and Gothic painting. Morgan says of his style: \\"The figure forms are very substantial, static and rounded with fairly natural fold patterns. The faces are of Byzantine type but with softer modelling in lighter shades of colour resulting in more gentle expressions\\", and says his \\"Winchester training seems beyond doubt\\".Morgan, 50 The five tinted drawings added around 1250 are in a style especially associated with England, and best known through the contemporary work of Matthew Paris at St Albans, although it had been an English speciality since Anglo-Saxon times. A pen drawing with a strong outline is coloured with light brushed washes (the archbishop is in fact purely in ink, perhaps unfinished). They may be connected with a now lost psalter, also at Westminster and recorded in the inventory of 1388, which was said to have been given by Henry III (r. 1216-1272), who was rebuilding Edward the Confessor's abbey and also his Palace of Westminster at just this time. There are a number of documentary references to paintings in connection with the works on both buildings, now almost all lost.Royal, 118; Alexander & Binski, 310-313 on Henry III's programme Like most English tinted drawings around this time, these were once attributed to Matthew Paris or his \\"St Albans school\\", but recent scholars see them as characteristic of a distinct London style: \\"The Westminster work has more detailed, refined faces, and contours and internal folds show more jagged effects of line. There is a sophisticated professionalism about the drawing which contrasts with Matthew's accomplished but somewhat na√Øve style\\".Alexander & Binski, 200 (entry by Nigel Morgan) Iconography The iconography of both campaigns of illustration has been related to the increasing assertion of royal power typical of the period. Meyer Schapiro pointed to very close similarities between some of the earlier miniatures and those in the slightly later Glazier Psalter, now Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (MS G. 25), in particular in their miniatures of Christ in Majesty.Schapiro, 348-351; the Glazier Psalter is no. 50 in Morgan He analysed in the Glazier miniatures a programme related to the controversies over the balance between the power of monarchies and the Church that were very intense at this period, though finding the Glazier Psalter probably on the Church's side of the argument.Schapiro, 340-348 The Westminster miniatures lack some of the features that are distinctive in the Glazier Psalter, but the representation of the \\"sacred dynasty\\" of David, Mary and Jesus may still be significant, but \\"the idea is less clear-cut, less systematic, than in the later book\\".Schapiro, 331, 347, both quoted in turn St Christopher carrying the Christ-Child, f 220v, perhaps the first such image in English art The grouping of the five tinted drawings is more unusual, since they combine the clearly devotional images of St Christopher and the Veronica face of Christ, with three figures from each of the Three Estates of contemporary society ‚Äî the archbishop does not appear to represent a saint, despite being opposite St Christopher. The Veronica image was popular at this time, and appears in a number of English manuscripts,Alexander & Binski, 200, though at Royal, 118, the drawings are described as comprising \\"Christ, various saints and a king\\" but St Christopher was a newly-popular saint in Northern Europe, and the Westminster drawing is \\"possibly his first isolated appearance in English art\\".Wilson, 113 The unusual drawing of the knight, with his horse and squire behind him, wearing crosses on his banner and surcoat, and kneeling to his king has been described as \\"a crucial representation not only of the relationship of mutual responsibility imposed by the feudal system, but also of the chivalric code of which the Christian king, especially in the Crusades, was the supreme exponent\\".Alexander & Binski, 196 (quoted), 200 In an analysis of the changing role of the \\"new knighthood\\" of the 13th century,Coss, 136 another scholar cites the drawing as one of a number of examples from art showing \\"exalted notions of knighthood and its high moral purpose\\", and speculates that the king may represent Edward the Confessor, and the drawing be linked to Henry III taking the cross.Coss, 137-138, which cites Alexander & Binsky (giving the wrong catalogue number) who do not mention these ideas, other than in the quotation earlier in this paragraph. Henry became a \\"crucesignatus\\", signed up for the Crusades, on three occasions during his long reign, though he never in fact followed this through in person. The second occasion in March 1250, at a time when the campaigning of Louis IX of France in Egypt in the Seventh Crusade seemed about to achieve great successes, has puzzled historians since Matthew Paris, with many suggesting that Henry's main motive may have been either to claim a share of the great rewards of a conquest of Egypt, or alternatively to take control of the widespread enthusiasm for crusading that had seized the English military classes, with complicated political and financial implications for the crown.Tyerman, 113-119 Henry's proposed expedition was accompanied by an artistic \\"propaganda\\" campaign, \\"apparently confined to 1251-52\\", which included the recorded painted decorations in the Antioch Chamber in Westminster Palace, showing the Siege of Antioch in 1098, the first great victory of the Crusades, and other works at Clarendon Palace and Winchester Castle. Of these the only surviving works, other than perhaps the drawing, are tiles from Chertsey Abbey, perhaps originally made for a royal palace, showing the combat of Richard the Lionheart and Saladin, among other scenes, and some at Westminster.Tyerman, 117 (quoted); Alexander and Binski, 181-182 and 204 (by John Cherry); the British Museum displays The Chertsey combat tiles In 1254 Henry suggested that the rededication of the new Westminster Abbey be held on St Edward's feast-day in October 1255, before his planned embarkation; in fact he was diverted to settling unrest in his possessions in Gascony and, whatever his original intentions had been, never went further.Tyerman, 118 Exhibitions The manuscript is now not normally on display (though it was for considerable periods when in the British Museum), but has been exhibited in the British Museum, English Art 1934 and English book illustration, 966-1846 1965; Metropolitan Museum of Art New York, The Year 1200 1970, Hayward Gallery, English Romanesque Art 1066-1200 1984; Royal Academy of Art, Age of Chivalry: Art in Plantagenet England 1200-1400 1987.

Its culture differs from that of Europe or the US. The term 'blogosphere' was first formed colloquially in 1999, and has since evolved to mean \\"the cultural or intellectual environment in which blogs are written and read.\\" In Canada, the 'blog' employs a vast array of social media technology. This includes traditional forms of individual blogging hosted through personal websites or blogging tools such as Blogger or Tumblr, and has also come to include micro-blogging platforms such as Twitter. In Canada, blogging has more recently been adopted by the mainstream media. By necessity, these traditional forms of news media aspire to retain a voice in an increasingly globalized public sphere. Presently, three of Ontario's major newspapers (The Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, and The National Post) retain a roster of bloggers, each providing commentary on current events. Political blogs A primary player in this new rapid-fire culture of information sharing is the 'political blog,' a term use to describe any blog that provides written commentary on current political news and events. Scholar Antoinette Pole views the political blog as a \\"prominent agent driving many rapid changes...[and] fundamentally transforming politics and civic engagement.\\" In the United States, a country of increasingly polarized mainstream ideologies, Pole acknowledges that blogging is a phenomenon that may only make these differences more problematic. However, in Canada, a country where political divides are often less clear-cut, the atmosphere surrounding political blogging is entirely different and lines are more blurred. The dominant demographics and ideologies of the Canadian political blogosphere are different enough from their Western counterparts to merit their own course of study. Variety of opinion The views purveyed throughout the Canadian political blogosphere are as varied as the nation from which they stem. Despite this, particular demographics and ideologies are, as they are in any geography (material or not), inevitably more dominant than others, and definitively indicative of a specific intellectual culture. This is evident in an investigation of the dominant demographics and ideologies of blogs that are political in nature. Various studies initiated in Canada have made it clear that the vast majority of those who blog from a political perspective tend to write from the right-of-centre on the political spectrum. The immense growth and popularity of the Canadian political blogosphere is the complex product of particular demographics and ideologies, as well as a natural response to what Marshall McLuhan described as the global village or, perhaps more poetically in his hallmark text \\"Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man\\", as technological \\"extensions of consciousness.\\"  The Demographics of the Canadian blogosphere   Age  Canadian political bloggers occupy an older age demographic than regular internet users, and the rest of the general blogosphere. In 2004, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology surveyed nearly 500 bloggers from forty different countries. The research found that one half of individuals who said they blogged regularly were between the ages of 21 and 30. Perhaps more surprisingly, one third of individuals surveyed indicated they were between the ages of 31 and 40. Some data also exists that aims to identify the dominant demographics of readers and writers of political blogs. In 2006 a survey was put forth by advertising company 'blogads' that obtained approximately 36,000 responses from bloggers and blog readers worldwide (including a small percentage of Canadians). 22 percent of respondents who described themselves as blog readers were between the ages of 31 and 40, while a 27 percent were between the ages of 41 and 50, and a startling 23 percent between the ages of 51 and 60. This data, in contrast to the MIT study above, suggests that political bloggers are on average older than the general blogosphere. The little available Canadian data on the subject is in accordance with the aforementioned international trends, with only 50 percent of Canadians who engage in blog-use being between the ages of 18 and 34.  Education  In Canada, 45 percent of readers and writers of blogs hold post-secondary degrees. Currently, the group that most commonly utilizes blog networks as news sources are students under the age of 25.  Background  Nearly 80 percent of Canadian bloggers are white.  Income  With the exception of students in the midst of pursuing higher education, readers and writers of blogs in Canada tend to be in middle to high income brackets. A 2005 Ipsos-Reid survey found blogging to be most popular among individuals with an annual income of $60,000 a year or more. This can be seen to exist in correlation with the above data on bloggers and education.  Gender imbalance  The gender imbalance amongst users of the Canadian blogosphere is striking. Nearly half of Canadian men report they regularly engage with the blogosphere as content-producers or as readers, while only 35 percent of women report the same. This gender discrepancy seen in the Canadian blogosphere mirrors the blogging demographics of other Western nations. Of the 500 respondents to the aforementioned international 2004 MIT study, only 36 percent of respondents identified as female. Puzzlingly, this data exists in contradiction to the gender demographics of Canadian users in forms of other social media. Ipsos-Reid's 2009 research titled \\"What? You Don't Have a Social Network Profile? You Are Now in the Minority\\" indicates that in Canadian spheres of social media such as Facebook and Myspace, genders are evenly matched with the percentage of female users at times exceeding their male counterparts. On an international level, 53 percent of micro-blogging tool Twitter's users are reported to be female. Furthermore, Statistics Canada's biannual data of Canadian internet usage reveals that comparable percentages of men and women report having regular internet access to the internet at home. The participatory imbalance between male and female Canadian bloggers could be the result of a multitude of factors. The most simple explanation results from an examination of the Canadian blogosphere's gender demographics in tandem with existing statistics on blogger education levels, and average age. Given that Canadian blog users are generally a) in older age brackets in comparison to those who access the internet for general purposes, and b) on average hold higher levels of education than casual internet users (see above), it might be that the progression of time will see a narrowing of the educational gap between men and women. With this closure, and as more women come to mirror the educational demographics of Canadian bloggers, it is possible that the gap between genders in the blogosphere will close also. Given that the gender gap is also evident from studies of the American and other international blogospheres, a study of female political bloggers internationally is pertinent. In \\"Blogging the Political\\" scholar Antoinette Pole notes that the gap between male and female political bloggers is quite pronounced. In offering explanations for this disparity, Pole indicates that 75 percent of women who blog politically say they regularly face challenges in the blogosphere specific to their gender. These challenges may explain the lack of female political bloggers in the Canadian blogosphere. When taken into account that conservative political blogging accounts for a high percentage of all political blogging in Canada (see section titled 'Dominant Ideologies' for more), some conclusions for the lack of female political bloggers in Canada can be drawn. Pole believes that female conservative political bloggers face more challenges than their female liberal counterparts, writing that in the conservative blogosphere many women find they have great difficulty being taken seriously \\"on intellectual merit alone.\\" Others reported backlash from readers in feminist communities. As conservative political blogging is more dominant in Canada, and since female conservative political bloggers face challenges specific to their ideologies, this may very well explain an element of the gender divide. Furthermore, regardless of ideological grouping, the same study finds that the overwhelming majority of women in the political blogosphere are regular targets of sexism. Its author found that \\"due to limitations on space and pressure to attract large readerships\\" the mainstream media has a tendency to overlook, and under-reference, blogs written by women in favour of blog material written by men. She suggests that one reason mainstream media outlets do this is to pander to a predominantly male audience. Given that the mainstream Canadian media functions in largely the same business model as other major international media conglomerates, it is likely that the challenges described by female bloggers in Pole's study are equally applicable to the Canadian political blogosphere. Many individuals in the field of Media Studies find this gender gap to be extremely troubling, and symptomatic of the continued institutionalized alienation of women from the political arena.  Dominant ideologies  Demographics indicate, along with a cursory study of the Canadian political blogosphere, that the dominant ideology is right of centre.Please see final section in article for reasons why in Canada making a definitive claim is problematic. A number of self- described conservative blog aggregates exist, the most dominant being the 'Blogging Tories' which includes more than 300 blogs from the political right. Most Canadian conservative blogging networks view themselves as an alternative voice to what they perceive to be the liberalism of the mainstream media. While the group believes that they have \\"helped to counter a media that is not very friendly to the party,\\" one blogger notes that the blogging circle remains widely unknown outside of its own ideological sphere. The idea that the political right dominates the Canadian political blogosphere can also be seen in the views of other members of the Blogging Tories such as the blog Small Dead Animals, which ascribes to the view that Canadian conservatives \\"have been forced to listen while media and politicians alike have told me 'what Canadians think'...'You don't speak for me.'\\" Some content created by the Blogging Tories and Small Dead Animals has been criticized as offensive by others in the larger political blogosphere. The success of right-wing Canadian blogging lies in the belief held by the political right that they are a marginalized group within broader public discourse. To the individuals who comprise this subgroup of the Canadian blogosphere, right-wing political blogging is a means of fighting perceived oppression. This may explain its dominance. While conservatism dominates political blogging in Canada, data analysis from Ryerson University's Infoscape Research Lab at the Centre for the Study of Social Media indicates that left of centre political blogs are gaining track. In a tool specifically created to visualize the activity levels of political bloggers by political party affiliation (NDP, Liberal, and Conservative) on a day-to-day basis, it is evident that the more left of centre partisan blogospheres remain equally, if not more, active in recent blogging activity. Though this data is at odds with that described in the previous paragraph, a few arguments can be made. It is possible that while conservative bloggers outnumber those who are ideologically left of centre, fewer conservative bloggers identify as partisan. Alternatively, perhaps more conservative blogs exist overall, but are accessed and posted to less frequently than the fewer left of centre political blogs. It may also be that Canada's political blogging trends are mirroring those in Australia where a long-standing conservative government has fueled the numbers of left of centre bloggers- the emergence of more centre-left blogging in Canada may be a reaction to Stephen Harper's continued governance. Popular left-leaning blog aggregates include Liblogs and the New Democrats Online (now defunct).  The new public sphere  In \\"The New Public Sphere: Global Civil Society, Communication Networks, and Global Governance,\\" sociologist Manuel Castells discusses the implications of the globalization of communication on the traditional Public Sphere. While the Public Sphere has traditionally been defined as \\"a network for communication information and points of views,\\" Castells argues that media has become an essential component. As a result of this, he says, \\"the networked society organizes itself on the basis of information networks.\\" This reorganization of the Public Sphere has resulted in what is now commonly called the New Public Sphere. The facets of communication that comprise the New Public Sphere are elements of Web 2.0, and primarily social networking tools such micro-blogging site Twitter and traditional blogs. The political blogosphere has become integral to the Public Sphere, and is argued to be a tool of public discussion dominating the political process from which \\"people make up their minds on the issues that affect their lives.\\" It is evident that as discussion integral to political engagement begins to rely on digital methods of communication, the blogosphere expands accordingly. The New Public Sphere necessitates an increased popularity in political blogging in order to bridge the growing gap between traditional forms of media and new media. In a Canadian context, the concept that political blogging has become a more essential part of the political process the more Canada as a nation has become enmeshed in digital culture can be seen in recent data from the Canadian Media Research Consortium. A 2004-2007 report found that \\"Canadians are not among the world's major weblog consumers or contributors, ranking in the middle of this group in percentage reading blogs and contributing to them. The countries in which weblogs are most popular appear to be those where other forms of public discourse are limited. Nevertheless, blogging and related forms of social networking and online self-expression are growing in Canada.\\" While the survey demonstrated that Canadians are not as frequent bloggers as individuals in other nations, it posits that there is a direct correlation between the amount of time that blogging is available as a technology and its level of absorption into Canadian culture. The same study notes that in Canada the \\"continued proliferation of [social networking and blogging] in the past three years\\" is indicative of its cultural appropriation.  The necessary growth of the Canadian blogosphere  In recent years, the mainstream media has to respond to the inevitability of the growing divide between those who use traditional new sources, such as newspapers and television, and those who now acquire news from a digital setting. Marshall McLuhan noted that one medium is not immediately replaced by another; print culture replaced manuscript culture over the course of more than a century. The same can be said of traditional news media. In the traditional Public Sphere, for example, news that stemmed from televisions and newspapers functioned to provide the material for public discourse that would take place in a physical setting. However, in the previously discussed shift to the New Public Sphere, public discourse becomes increasingly enmeshed in the digitization of communication. While traditional forms of media for the near future remain the same, these same news sources have had to scramble to accommodate the digitization of public discourse. The predominant 'coping mechanism' the mainstream media has taken has been the introduction of blogs, and bloggers, to their production. These blogs, while still rooted in the traditional medium from which they stem, provide a bridge between tradition and the digital. It can therefore be seen, in extension of this, that the changing nature of the Public Sphere necessitates the introduction and growth of blogs in Canada as an alternative method of public discourse, particularly where this discourse concerns the political. The section below will briefly outline how a staple of traditional news media in Canada, CBC's The National, has responded to the demands of the digital age through their entry into the Canadian blogosphere.  CBC's The National  The CBC has taken measures since the mid-nineties to secure its place in the digital age of communication. The CBC's hallmark news programme The National launched its first website in 1996, with the intention of creating a more interactive experience for its viewers. A 1996 television segment from the CBC's archives features an explanation of what a website is, and the suggestion that \\"the internet website [was] simply another way\\" to facilitate public discourse among the Canadian population. To accommodate discussion between viewers across Canada, a section of the website titled 'The National Feedback' was launched. This element was marketed as \\"a twenty-four hour interactive thread\\" that was continually being \\"improved and modified daily to serve you better.\\" Essentially, The National had created a proto-blog, though the term did not yet exist to describe it as such. Viewers were free to comment on, and discuss amongst themselves, the content of the news they were receiving in a digital setting. In October 2009 The National relaunched its website once more, this time incorporating a number of new interactive elements, including a blog. In the website's first ever blog post, the CBC's Bonnie Brown wrote \\"You've probably noticed already that our website looks different. We've launched a National blog, as well as a regular voting and comments feature...Our goal is to give our loyal viewers more choices of how, when and where they can watch The National's content, and we hope you take advantage of these new options.\\" The re-launch of the website came alongside the programme's re-branding as a faster-paced and more 'modern' news source. The reasoning behind its relaunch was to better integrated the CBC into the oncoming digital age. On the day of the launch in its blog, Peter Mansbridge wrote that :Our work was focused on one central finding in the research: news viewers want the real story. They want to know what really happened and what it really means. They want our coverage to be unbiased, engaging and worth watching. They want smart. That was great news, because that's what we've always wanted too. The challenge for us, then, was to develop a strategy built more sharply around that goal. From this, it can be ascertained that the remodeling of this long-running television programme was in response to market research that recognized the shift in the localization of the Public Sphere. It was no longer enough to stay relevant to public discourse as a traditional form of television news media, and so the CBC created a framework where they could remain participants in Canadian public discourse. In developing interactive forms of social media such as blogs and opening up communication in the digital realm, the CBC was able to become a more relevant element of the New Public Sphere. This example demonstrates how the shift of public discourse into the New Public Sphere necessitates and encourages the growth of public discourse in a Web 2.0 setting and, by extension, the expansion of the mainstream media into the political blogosphere. A dominant feature that bridges the divide between traditional news media (such as The National on television) and the impending digitization of communications (wherein people are accessing more news from a digital environment) has been in the form of blogging tools. It must, however, be considered that exactly how relevant the attempts by mainstream media sources (namely newspapers and broadcasters) are to the greater New Public Sphere is still a question to be answered. One scholar of media suggests that the \\"blogger employed by the major news organizations continue to operate under a different agenda from...political blogs.\\" This study suggests that as long as mainstream media sources use Web 2.0 to raise their profiles among consumers instead of their level of engagement, their attempts to reestablish themselves as vital contributors of news and discussion in the digital age will remain futile.  Theories of insular ideological groupings  A 2009 study of the larger global political blogosphere, with particular emphasis placed on Australia, revealed striking levels of insulation between political views at different measures of the political spectrum. It found evidence \\"for the gradual formation of polarized blog clusters around leading blogs on either side of the politics.\\" The research goes on to suggest that gradually over time the ideological polarization of blog discussion becomes more pronounced as discussion ceases to be oriented around specific news articles, and becomes more oriented on the blog posts that stem from them. A visualization of this study reveals two clusters of political blogs on either side of the diagram- one cluster represents left-leaning blogs and the other right-leaning. The vast majority of discussion is insulated, with discourse only occasionally moving between ideological spheres. A 2009 American study demonstrated similar findings when link analysis studies found profound partisan segmentation in the political blogosphere. The authors cite the 2004 American presidential election, where a two-month-long analysis of 1,000 casual and 40 hugely influential political blogs preceding the election demonstrated that \\"in assessing blogrolls links and page citation links...91 percent...remained within partisan communities.\\" A similar analysis of insulated partisan blogging in Canada does not yet exist. However, given that both the United States and Australia share these characteristics, it is likely that ideologies within the Canadian political blogosphere also share similar polarizations. In a nation such as Canada major limbs of the mainstream media tend to have obvious political leanings, it can be argued that the same trend would most likely apply. For example, a left-of- centre individual would not normally be exposed to, interact with, and share news articles that stem from the Toronto Sun. A cursory glance of conservative blog aggregate the Blogging Tories is also indicative of polarizing trends within the Canadian political blogosphere. While anyone can request to become an affiliate of the Blogging Tories, the primary site requires its affiliates to \\"add conservative-related flash video content to your blog which will entice visitors to return to your site.\\" This suggests that political blogging exists within an ideologically single-mind sphere of public discourse, and that little effort is made to initiate discussion with blogs that might not hold the same foundational beliefs. The polarizing communication that exists within political blogosphere also provides an explanation as to why it is so difficult to definitively, and quantitatively, ascertain which ideologies are more dominant than others: in the political blogosphere, studies demonstrate that readers primarily choose to engage only with blogs that share their own beliefs.

It occurred in Blodget's Hotel building, Washington on December 15, 1836. An initial investigation considered the possibility of arson due to suspected corruption in the Post Office, which shared the same building, but it was later ruled out. The cause was ultimately determined to be accidental. The fire is considered to be a unique point in the historical events of the Patent Office that caused policy changes. Local fire suppression efforts were incapable of preventing the damage due to lack of fire personnel and proper equipment. Many patent documents and models from the preceding three decades were irretrievably lost. As a result of the fire, Congress and the newly legally revamped Patent Office changed the way it handled its record keeping, assigning numbers to patents and requiring multiple copies of supporting documentation. History In 1810, Congress had authorized the purchase of the unfinished Blodgett's Hotel from its builder to house the Post and Patent offices. Congress was aware of the fire risk. During an event of the War of 1812, Superintendent Dr. William Thornton convinced members of the British expeditionary force to leave the Patent Office standing while they burned the rest of the city. Congress funded the covering of the building with a slate roof in 1820. They also purchased of a fire engine for protection of the building against fires. Because of those changes the volunteer fire department lost its sense of purpose and was disbanded. The complete firehouse equipped with the fire engine was just down the street. Although equipped with a forcing pump and with riveted leather hose 1,000 feet (300 m) long (all purchased 16 years earlier by Act of Congress), there were no firefighters available. The fire broke out at 3 a.m. on December 15, 1836. The Patent Office then was located in Blodget's Hotel, as was the fire department and the post office. Patent Office employees stored firewood in the basement of the hotel, near where postal employees disposed of the hot ashes from their fires. Sometime after midnight that morning the hot ashes ignited the firewood. The fire department's hose was old and defective and would not funnel water onto the fire, and running a bucket brigade to put out the building blaze turned out to be ineffective. All 9,957 patents and 7,000 related patent models were lost. John Ruggles, chairman of the Senate investigating committee, reported that the lost items included 168 folio volumes of records, 26 large portfolios of some nine thousand drawings, related descriptive patent documents, and miscellaneous paperwork. The 7,000 lost models included those of various textile manufacturing processes and several models of steam-powered machinery for propelling boats (including Robert Fulton's original bound folio of full-color patent drawings, done in his own hand). Ruggles said that the documents and models destroyed by the fire represented the history of American invention for fifty years. He also said that the Patent Office's own model-cases, presses and seals, desks, book- cases and office furniture were also destroyed. The entire library of books were lost except one that an employee just happened to have secretly taken home to read, which was Volume 6 of Repertory of Arts & Manufactures (1794). Aftermath U. S. Patent Office building constructed after the 1836 Great Fire The Patent Office, c. 1855 Congress investigated the fire immediately, suspecting arson. The Post Office Department at the time was already under investigation for allegedly awarding dishonest mail contracts. It was first thought that perhaps the fire was set to destroy evidence. However, it turned out that the Post Office Department had saved all their documents. Investigators concluded that someone had stored hot ashes in a box in the basement. The live embers then ignited the firewood; no one was identified as having caused the fire. The Patent Office was moved to the old City Hall, at the time the District Courthouse. The fire occurred when the Patent Act of 1836 was being put into place, which had required that patent applications be examined before being granted. An amendment to it the following year required submission of two copies of drawings‚Äîone for safekeeping in the patent office; the other attached to the patent grant transmitted to the applicant. The requirement ended in 1870 when the Office began printing complete copies of patents as issued. All patents from prior to the fire were listed later as X-Patents by the office. The March 3, 1837, Act made provisions to restore the models and drawings lost in the 1836 fire. An amount of $100,000 was appropriated as a budget. Around 9,957 patent records and some 7,000 invention models were lost. One method of restoration was by getting back a duplicate from the original inventor. By 1849 the restoration process was discontinued and it was determined that $88,237.32 had been spent from the budget allowed. Of the estimated 9,957, only 2,845 patent records were restored. Congress solicited for the restoration of the lost patents and appropriated monies for this purpose. It is difficult for modern researchers to find those patents because many of the related documents were burned. In the aftermath of the fire, the way patents were identified was changed. Previously the patent records were not numbered and could be researched only by the date of patent or inventor's name. After the fire, unique numbers were issued by the Patent Office for each new patent. The Patent Office through the Patent Act of 1836 became its own organization under the United States Department of State. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth became its first Commissioner in 1835. He immediately began construction of a new fire-proof building, which was not completed until 1864. A fire in 1877 destroyed the west and north wing of the new building and caused even more damage..

He served as Minister of Justice in the Weimar Republic from 30 November 1923 until 15 April 1924 under Chancellor Wilhelm Marx. Early life Erich Emminger was born on 25 June 1880 in Eichst√§tt, Bavaria. His parents were Johann Adolf Erich Emminger (1856-1909), a Gymnasialprofessor, and his wife Marie Therese (1854‚Äì99), n√©e M√ºller, daughter of an Augsburg notary. Emminger married Maria Sch√§rft in 1906. Their children included Otmar Emminger, future president of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Following his training as a lawyer at M√ºnster, Emminger practiced law at Augsburg (1906‚Äì08) and Nuremberg (1908‚Äì09). In 1909 he became a civil servant (state prosecutor and Amtsrichter). He participated in World War I first as a voluntary soldier and later as a Kriegsgerichtsrat (military judge). Political career Emminger was a member of the Catholic Center Party (Zentrum) and, from 1913-18 held a seat in the Reichstag for the constituency of Weilheim. In 1918, he joined the Bavarian People's Party (BVP) and represented it in the Reichstag 1920-33. Emminger was Minister of Justice in the first cabinet of chancellor Wilhelm Marx, which took office on 30 November 1923. His tenure was defined by the passage of three decrees of 22 December 1923, 4 January and 13 February 1924, which were based on the ' of 8 December 1923. These significantly changed civil and criminal law and the judiciary system with an eye towards speeding up proceedings. The reform of 4 January became known as the so-called Emminger Reform that among other things abolished the jury as trier of fact and replaced it with a mixed system of judges and lay judges in Germany's judiciary which still exists today. Schwurgerichte (formerly based on jurors) kept their name but were in fact replaced by lay judges. Since the reforms were successful, they were kept in place by later legislation once the enabling law had lapsed. Late 1923 was among the most tumultuous times of the Weimar Republic, bringing the peak of hyperinflation and the ongoing Occupation of the Ruhr. One of Emminger's main goals as a politician and lawyer became a revaluation of the currency to partially offset the adverse social consequences of hyperinflation. As a minister he prevented the planned Aufwertungsverbot from becoming law and continued to fight for revaluation as a Reichstag delegate. Emminger left office on 15 April 1924 and his Secretary of State, Curt Jo√´l, took over as acting Minister of Justice. He remained a member of the Rechtsausschuss of the Reichstag and 1927-31 served as chairman of the Zentralvorstand der deutsch- √∂sterreichischen Arbeitsgemeinschaft which worked towards a harmonisation of German and Austrian laws. He also contributed to a reform of the criminal law. Emminger was re-elected to the Reichstag in 1933 but the Nazi takeover ended his political activities. He worked as a judge at the Oberste Landesgericht of Bavaria in 1931-35 and then at the Oberlandesgericht. From 1946 until his retirement in July 1949, he was Senatspr√§sident there. Emminger died in Munich on 30 August 1951.

The C.I was a rare example of an aircraft flown by the Central Powers which had a pusher configuration. Design and development The German aeronautical engineer Gustav Otto designed the C.I as a reconnaissance aircraft for use by the Imperial German Flying Corps. It was an all wooden, fabric covered twin boom design with box- shaped booms.

They were delivered in two batches, each of six aircraft, ordered in August and November 1915 respectively, and served until at least April 1916. Initially considered \\"good for nothing\\" by the Bavarian airmen who first flew them, the aircraft gained a positive reputation during their short careers.Harris, 2007 p.169 They were favourably viewed for their stability and reliability yet were nimble with good handling characteristics both on the ground and in the air.Nedialkov, 2001 The aircraft saw limited export success, being sold to the Bulgarian Air Force in 1915.Flanagan, 1982, p.156 Thirteen were delivered to Bozhurishte in spring 1916, serving with 2 Aeroplane Otdelenie based at Udovo. The first batch was powered by the Benz engine, while the latter used the slightly more powerful Mercedes inline. These aircraft were used in the bombing and reconnaissance role.Harris, 2007 p.168 They served until 1917, when they were replaced by the more capable Albatros C.III.

Besides polonaises, variations, Rondos and potpourris for violin and orchestra, he composed two string quartets and the Adagio et Polonaise for clarinet and orchestra. Biography Franz Pech√°ƒçek was a very gifted student and already at a very early age performed as a soloist. He was trained by his father Franti≈°ek Martin Pech√°ƒçek and by Ignaz Schuppanzigh and Emanuel Aloys F√∂rster. When he was six he performed before the imperial court and in 1803 he went publicly with his father for the first time to Prague, where he was received with great success, thus gaining his reputation as a child prodigy. Other musical education he acquired in Vienna, where he studied composition with F√∂rster. From 1809 to 1822 he was a violinist at the Theater an der Wien, first as a concertmaster and later as a second conductor. In 1818 he was appointed first violinist of the Hanoverian court orchestra. Guest performance tours took him further to Dresden and Leipzig, and from 1824 to 1825 the cities of southern Germany. He also became concertmaster of the court orchestra in Stuttgart from 1822 until 1826, being appointed as concertmaster of the Grand Duke of Baden Karlsruhe court orchestra in 1827, where he worked until 15 September 1840. In 1832 he made a trip to Paris, but there the expected success did not come. Parisians saw in his play an imitation of Niccolo Paganini and, as a result of his strenuous concerts, he was only a disappointment. As a violinist and composer Pech√°ƒçek was very esteemed, writing works almost exclusively for solo violin with accompaniment. As a virtuoso, however, he never defined himself as such. He composed about 40 works. These are short pieces for violin and orchestra, dances and variations.

For each point in the shape, HKS defines its feature vector representing the point's local and global geometric properties. Applications include segmentation, classification, structure discovery, shape matching and shape retrieval. HKS was introduced in 2009 by Jian Sun, Maks Ovsjanikov and Leonidas Guibas. It is based on heat kernel, which is a fundamental solution to the heat equation. HKS is one of the many recently introduced shape descriptors which are based on the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator associated with the shape.  Overview  Shape analysis is the field of automatic digital analysis of shapes, e.g., 3D objects. For many shape analysis tasks (such as shape matching/retrieval), feature vectors for certain key points are used instead of using the complete 3D model of the shape. An important requirement of such feature descriptors is for them to be invariant under certain transformations. For rigid transformations, commonly used feature descriptors include shape context, spin images, integral volume descriptors and multiscale local features, among others. HKS allows isometric transformations which generalizes rigid transformations. HKS is based on the concept of heat diffusion over a surface. Given an initial heat distribution u_0(x) over the surface, the heat kernel h_t(x,y) relates the amount of heat transferred from x to y after time t. The heat kernel is invariant under isometric transformations and stable under small perturbations to the isometry. In addition, the heat kernel fully characterizes shapes up to an isometry and represents increasingly global properties of the shape with increasing time. Since h_t(x,y) is defined for a pair of points over a temporal domain, using heat kernels directly as features would lead to a high complexity. HKS instead restricts itself to just the temporal domain by considering only h_t(x,x). HKS inherits most of the properties of heat kernels under certain conditions.  Technical details  The heat diffusion equation over a compact Riemannian manifold M (possibly with a boundary) is given by, : \\\\left(\\\\Delta - \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right) u(x,t) = 0 where \\\\Delta is the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator and u(x,t) is the heat distribution at a point x at time t. The solution to this equation can be expressed as, : u(x,t) = \\\\int h_t(x,y)u_0(y)dy. The eigen decomposition of the heat kernel is expressed as, : h_t(x,y) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp(-\\\\lambda_i t) \\\\phi_i(x) \\\\phi_i(y) where \\\\lambda_i and \\\\phi_i are the i^{th} eigenvalue and eigenfunction of \\\\Delta. The heat kernel fully characterizes a surface up to an isometry: For any surjective map T:M\\\\rightarrow N between two Riemannian manifolds M and N, if h_t(x,y) = h_t(T(x),T(y)) then T is an isometry, and vice versa. For a concise feature descriptor, HKS restricts the heat kernel only to the temporal domain, : h_t(x,x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp(-\\\\lambda_i t) \\\\phi_i^2(x). HKS, similar to the heat kernel, characterizes surfaces under the condition that the eigenvalues of \\\\Delta for M and N are non-repeating. The terms \\\\exp(-\\\\lambda_i t) can be intuited as a bank of low-pass filters, with \\\\lambda_i determining the cutoff frequencies.  Practical considerations  Since h_t(x,x) is, in general, a non-parametric continuous function, HKS is in practice represented as a discrete sequence of \\\\\\\\{h_{t_1}(x,x),\\\\ldots,h_{t_n}(x,x)\\\\\\\\} values sampled at times t_1,\\\\ldots,t_n. In most applications, the underlying manifold for an object is not known. The HKS can be computed if a mesh representation of the manifold is available, by using a discrete approximation to \\\\Delta and using the discrete analogue of the heat equation. In the discrete case, the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator is a sparse matrix and can be written as, : L = A^{-1}W where A is a positive diagonal matrix with entries A(i,i) corresponding to the area of the triangles in the mesh sharing the vertex i, and W is a symmetric semi-definite weighting matrix. L can be decomposed into L = \\\\Phi \\\\Lambda \\\\Phi^T A, where \\\\Lambda is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of L arranged in the ascending order, and \\\\Phi is the matrix with the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors. The discrete heat kernel is the matrix given by, : K_t = \\\\Phi \\\\exp(-t\\\\Lambda) \\\\Phi^T. The elements k_t(i,j) represents the heat diffusion between vertices i and j after time t. The HKS is then given by the diagonal entries of this matrix, sampled at discrete time intervals. Similar to the continuous case, the discrete HKS is robust to noise.  Limitations   Non-repeating eigenvalues  The main property that characterizes surfaces using HKS up to an isometry holds only when the eigenvalues of the surfaces are non-repeating. There are certain surfaces (especially those with symmetry) where this condition is violated. A sphere is a simple example of such a surface.  Time parameter selection  The time parameter in the HKS is closely related to the scale of global information. However, there is no direct way to choose the time discretization. The existing method chooses time samples logarithmically which is a heuristic with no guarantees  Time complexity  The discrete heat kernel requires eigendecomposition of a matrix of size n \\\\times n, where n is the number of vertices in the mesh representation of the manifold. Computing the eigendecomposition is an expensive operation, especially as n increases. Note, however, that because of the inverse exponential dependence on the eigenvalue, typically only a small (less than 100) eigenvectors are sufficient to obtain a good approximation of the HKS.  Non-isometric transformations  The performance guarantees for HKS only hold for truly isometric transformations. However, deformations for real shapes are often not isometric. A simple example of such transformation is closing of the fist by a person, where the geodesic distances between two fingers changes.  Relation with other methods   Curvature  The (continuous) HKS at a point x, h_t(x,x) on the Riemannian manifold is related to the scalar curvature s(x) by, : h_t(x,x) = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi t} + \\\\frac{s(x)}{12\\\\pi} + O(t). Hence, HKS can as be interpreted as the curvature of x at scale t.  Wave kernel signature (WKS)  The WKS follows a similar idea to the HKS, replacing the heat equation with the Schr√∂dinger wave equation, : \\\\left( i\\\\Delta + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right) \\\\psi(x,t) = 0 where \\\\psi(x,t) is the complex wave function. The average probability of measuring the particle at a point x is given by, : p(x) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} f^2(\\\\lambda_i) \\\\phi_i^2(x) where f is the initial energy distribution. By fixing a family of these energy distributions f_i(x), the WKS can be obtained as a discrete sequence \\\\\\\\{ p_{f_1}(x),\\\\ldots,p_{f_n}(x)\\\\\\\\}. Unlike HKS, the WKS can be intuited as a set of band-pass filters leading to better feature localization. However, the WKS does not represent large-scale features well (as they are filtered out) yielding poor performance at shape matching applications.  Global point signature (GPS)  Similar to the HKS, the GPS is based on the Laplace- Beltrami operator. GPS at a point x is a vector of scaled eigenfunctions of the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator computed at x. The GPS is a global feature whereas the scale of the HKS can be varied by varying the time parameter for heat diffusion. Hence, the HKS can be used in partial shape matching applications whereas the GPS cannot.  Spectral graph wavelet signature (SGWS)  SGWS provides a general form for spectral descriptors, where one can obtain HKS by specifying the filter function. SGWS is a multiresolution local descriptor that is not only isometric invariant, but also compact, easy to compute and combines the advantages of both band-pass and low-pass filters.  Extensions   Scale invariance  Even though the HKS represents the shape at multiple scales, it is not inherently scale invariant. For example, the HKS for a shape and its scaled version are not the same without pre- normalization. A simple way to ensure scale invariance is by pre-scaling each shape to have the same surface area (e.g. 1). Using the notation above, this means: \\\\begin{align} s &= \\\\sum_j A_j \\\\\\\\\\\\ A &= A / s \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\lambda_i &= s \\\\lambda_i \\\\text{ for each } i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi_i &= \\\\sqrt{s} \\\\phi_i \\\\text{ for each } i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Alternatively, scale-invariant version of the HKS can also be constructed by generating a Scale space representation. In the scale-space, the HKS of a scaled shape corresponds to a translation up to a multiplicative factor. The Fourier transform of this HKS changes the time-translation into the complex plane, and the dependency on translation can be eliminated by considering the modulus of the transform. . An alternative scale invariant HKS can be established by working out its construction through a scale invariant metric, as defined in.  Volumetric HKS  The HKS is defined for a boundary surface of a 3D shape, represented as a 2D Riemannian manifold. Instead of considering only the boundary, the entire volume of the 3D shape can be considered to define the volumetric version of the HKS. The Volumetric HKS is defined analogous to the normal HKS by considering the heat equation over the entire volume (as a 3-submanifold) and defining a Neumann boundary condition over the 2-manifold boundary of the shape. Volumetric HKS characterizes transformations up to a volume isometry, which represent the transformation for real 3D objects more faithfully than boundary isometry.  Shape Search  The scale-invariant HKS features can be used in the bag-of- features model for shape retrieval applications. The features are used to construct geometric words by taking into account their spatial relations, from which shapes can be constructed (analogous to using features as words and shapes as sentences). Shapes themselves are represented using compact binary codes to form an indexed collection. Given a query shape, similar shapes in the index with possibly isometric transformations can be retrieved by using the Hamming distance of the code as the nearness-measure.

In 2005 he moved to Stanford University and is currently the director of the Brains in Silicon Lab.  Research  Boahen is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of neuromorphic engineering, a field founded by Carver Mead in the 1980s. In contrast to the field of artificial intelligence, which merely takes inspiration from the brain, neuromorphic engineers seek to develop a new computing paradigm based on the brain's organizing principles. The brain employs a computing paradigm that is fundamentally different from digital computers. Instead of using digital signals for computation as well as communication, the brain uses analog signals (i.e., graded dendritic potentials) for computation and digital signals (i.e., all-or-none axonal potentials) for communication. Having explored this unique hybrid of digital and analogue techniques over the past three decades, neuromorphic engineers are now beginning to understand and exploit its advantages. Potential applications of their work include brain-machine interfaces, autonomous robots, and machine intelligence. Boahen often speaks of the promise of efficient computing as an inspiration for his work, writing ‚ÄúA typical room- size supercomputer weighs approximately 1,000 times more, occupies 10,000 times more space and consumes a millionfold more power than does the cantaloupe-size lump of neural tissue that makes up the brain.‚ÄùK Boahen, Neuromorphic Microchips, Scientific American, vol 292, no 5, pp 56-63, May 2005.

Stuart Carlton, and John Cook. Surveys of scientists' views on climate change ‚Äì with a focus on human-caused or anthropogenic global warming (AGW) ‚Äì have been undertaken since the 1990s. A 2016 paper (which was co-authored by Naomi Oreskes, Peter Doran, William Anderegg, Bart Verheggen, Ed Maibach, J. Stuart Carlton and John Cook, and which was based on a half a dozen independent studies by the authors) concluded that \\"the finding of 97% consensus [that humans are causing recent global warming] in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.\\"048002 2010s  Verheggen et al., 2014  In 2014, Bart Verheggen of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency surveyed 1,868 climate scientists. They found that, consistent with other research, the level of agreement on anthropogenic causation correlated with expertise - 90% of those surveyed with more than 10 peer-reviewed papers related to climate (just under half of survey respondents) explicitly agreed that greenhouse gases was the main cause of global warming. They included researchers on mitigation and adaptation in their surveys in addition to physical climate scientists, leading to a slightly lower level of consensus compared to previous studies.  Powell, 2013  James L. Powell, a former member of the National Science Board and current executive director of the National Physical Science Consortium, analyzed published research on global warming and climate change between 1991 and 2012 and found that of the 13,950 articles in peer-reviewed journals, only 24 (<0.2%) rejected anthropogenic global warming. This was a follow-up to an analysis looking at 2,258 peer-reviewed articles published between November 2012 and December 2013 revealed that only one of the 9,136 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.The study in question was:  John Cook et al., 2013  Cook et al. examined 11,944 abstracts from the peer-reviewed scientific literature from 1991‚Äì2011 that matched the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. They found that, while 66.4% of them expressed no position on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), of those that did, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are contributing to global warming. They also invited authors to rate their own papers and found that, while 35.5% rated their paper as expressing no position on AGW, 97.2% of the rest endorsed the consensus. In both cases the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position was marginally increasing over time. They concluded that the number of papers actually rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research. In their discussion of the results, the authors said that the large proportion of abstracts that state no position on AGW is as expected in a consensus situation, as anticipated in a chapter published in 2007, adding that \\"the fundamental science of AGW is no longer controversial among the publishing science community and the remaining debate in the field has moved on to other topics.\\" A 2016 study entitled Learning from mistakes in climate research examined the quality of the 3% of peer-reviewed papers discovered by this work to reject the consensus view. They discovered that \\"replication reveals a number of methodological flaws, and a pattern of common mistakes emerges that is not visible when looking at single isolated cases\\".  Farnsworth and Lichter, 2011  In an October 2011 paper published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, researchers from George Mason University analyzed the results of a survey of 998 scientists working in academia, government, and industry. The scientists polled were members of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) or the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and listed in the 23rd edition of American Men and Women of Science, a biographical reference work on leading American scientists, and 489 returned completed questionnaires. Of those who replied, 97% agreed that global temperatures have risen over the past century. 84% agreed that \\"human-induced greenhouse warming is now occurring,\\" 5% disagreed, and 12% didn't know. Paywalled; full test online here, retrieved 30 November 2014. From Table I, \\"Q: In your opinion, is human- induced greenhouse warming now occurring?\\" Yes, 84%. No, 5%. Don't Know, 12% When asked what they regard as \\"the likely effects of global climate change in the next 50 to 100 years,\\" on a scale of 1 to 10, from Trivial to Catastrophic: 13% of respondents replied 1 to 3 (trivial/mild), 44% replied 4 to 7 (moderate), 41% replied 8 to 10 (severe/catastrophic), and 2% didn't know.  Anderegg, Prall, Harold, and Schneider, 2010  By Cook 2011 based on Doran 2009 and Anderegg 2010 studies. 97‚Äì98% of the most published climate researchers say humans are very likely causing most global warming. In another study 97.4% of publishing specialists in climate change say that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures. Anderegg et al., in a 2010 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), reviewed publication and citation data for 1,372 climate researchers, based on authorship of scientific assessment reports and membership on multisignatory statements about anthropogenic climate change. The number of climate-relevant publications authored or coauthored by each researcher was used to define their 'expertise', and the number of citations for each of the researcher's four highest-cited papers was used to define their 'prominence'. Removing researchers who had authored fewer than 20 climate publications reduced the database to 908 researchers but did not materially alter the results. The authors of the paper say that their database of researchers \\"is not comprehensive nor designed to be representative of the entire climate science community,\\" but say that since they drew the researchers from the most high- profile reports and public statements, it is likely that it represents the \\"strongest and most credentialed\\" researchers both 'convinced by the evidence' (CE) and 'unconvinced by the evidence' (UE) on the tenets of anthropogenic climate change.Scientists 'Convinced' of Climate Consensus More Prominent Than Opponents, Says Paper by Eli Kintisch, \\"Science Insider\\", Science, 21 June 2010 Anderegg et al. drew the following two conclusions: > (i) 97‚Äì98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field > surveyed here support the tenets of ACC (Anthropogenic Climate Change) > outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the > relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers > unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced > researchers.  2000s   Doran and Kendall Zimmerman, 2009  This paper is based on the Zimmerman 2008 MS thesis; the full methods are in the MS thesis. A web- based poll performed by Peter Doran and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman of the Earth and Environmental Sciences department, University of Illinois at Chicago. They received replies from 3,146 of the 10,257 polled Earth scientists. The survey was designed to take less than two minutes to complete. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures had generally risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. 76 out of the 79 respondents who \\"listed climate science as their area of expertise, and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change\\", thought that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Of those 79 scientists, 75 out of the 77 (97.4%) answered that human activity was a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures. The remaining two were not asked, because in question one they responded that temperatures had remained relatively constant. Economic geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent respectively thinking that human activity was a significant contributing factor. In summary, Doran and Zimmerman wrote:  Bray and von Storch, 2008  Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Research Centre in Germany, conducted an online survey in August 2008, of 2,059 climate scientists from 34 different countries, the third survey on this topic by these authors. A web link with a unique identifier was given to each respondent to eliminate multiple responses. A total of 375 responses were received giving an overall response rate of 18%. The climate change consensus results were published by Bray,, copy online at and another paper has also been published based on the survey. Copy available online at , retrieved 30 November 2014 The survey was composed of 76 questions split into a number of sections. There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public. Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from 'not at all' to 'very much'. In the section on climate change impacts, questions 20 and 21 were relevant to scientific opinion on climate change. Question 20, \\"How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?\\" Answers: 67.1% very much convinced (7), 26.7% to some large extent (5‚Äì6), 6.2% said to some small extent (2‚Äì4), none said not at all. Question 21, \\"How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?\\" Answers: 34.6% very much convinced (7), 48.9% being convinced to a large extent (5‚Äì6), 15.1% to a small extent (2‚Äì4), and 1.35% not convinced at all (1).  STATS, 2007  In 2007, Harris Interactive surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the American Meteorological Society or the American Geophysical Union for the Statistical Assessment Service (STATS) at George Mason University. The survey found 97% agreed that global temperatures have increased during the past 100 years; 84% say they personally believe human-induced warming is occurring, and 74% agree that \\"currently available scientific evidence\\" substantiates its occurrence. Only 5% believe that human activity does not contribute to greenhouse warming; 41% say they thought the effects of global warming would be near catastrophic over the next 50‚Äì100 years; 44% say said effects would be moderately dangerous; 13% saw relatively little danger; 56% say global climate change is a mature science; 39% say it is an emerging science.  Oreskes, 2004  A 2004 article by geologist and historian of science Naomi Oreskes summarized a study of the scientific literature on climate change. (see also for an exchange of letters to Science) The essay concluded that there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. The author analyzed 928 abstracts of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, listed with the keywords \\"global climate change\\". Oreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. 75% of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories, thus either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change; none of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be \\"remarkable\\". According to the report, \\"authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point.\\"  Bray and von Storch, 2003  In 2003, Bray and von Storch conducted a survey of the perspectives of climate scientists on global climate change. The survey received 530 responses from 27 different countries. The 2003 survey has been strongly criticized on the grounds that it was performed on the web with no means to verify that the respondents were climate scientists or to prevent multiple submissions. The survey required entry of a username and password, but the username and password were circulated to a climate change denial mailing list and elsewhere on the internet. Bray and von Storch defended their results and accused climate change deniers of interpreting the results with bias. Bray's submission to Science on 22 December 2004 was rejected. One of the questions asked in the survey was \\"To what extent do you agree or disagree that climate change is mostly the result of anthropogenic causes?\\", with a value of 1 indicating strongly agree and a value of 7 indicating strongly disagree.Climate scientists‚Äô views on climate change: a survey The results showed a mean of 3.62, with 50 responses (9.4%) indicating \\"strongly agree\\" and 54 responses (9.7%) indicating \\"strongly disagree\\". The same survey indicates a 72% to 20% endorsement of the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that \\"there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions.\\"  1990s  * In 1996, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch undertook a survey of climate scientists on attitudes towards global warming and related matters. The results were subsequently published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The paper addressed the views of climate scientists, with a response rate of 40% from a mail survey questionnaire to 1000 scientists in Germany, the United States and Canada. Most of the scientists accepted that global warming was occurring and appropriate policy action should be taken, but there was wide disagreement about the likely effects on society and almost all agreed that the predictive ability of currently existing models was limited. On a scale of 1 (highest confidence) to 7 (lowest confidence) regarding belief in the ability to make \\"reasonable predictions\\" the mean was 4.8 and 5.2 for 10- and 100-year predictions, respectively. On the question of whether global warming is occurring or will occur, the mean response was 3.3, and for future prospects of warming the mean was 2.6. * A Gallup poll of 400 members of the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society along with an analysis of reporting on global warming by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a report on which was issued in 1992.

The mine has been written about by local historians and various magazines. Many have searched for the lost placer mine of Jolly Jack. It is a local legend in the Boundary Country. Legend A prospector named Jack Thornton had been prospecting many creeks around the city of Greenwood, British Columbia. Jack Thornton was also known as \\"Jolly Jack\\" and had been in the US Navy at one time. Thornton lived in a cabin located near Boundary Creek. Thornton discovered a source of placer gold somewhere near Greenwood around 1900. The gold discovered was coarse and heavy with nuggets weighing an ounce. This gold was red and heavily oxidized like dark copper. Thornton never revealed the location of the source of his placer gold. In 1967, May Jones, one of Thornton's surviving daughters left an account at the Greenwood Museum. May states \\"My mother told me that my father really had found something very rich, but where it was he took to the great beyond with him. It was in the spring of the year. He left home in the morning and was back at night and he had a baking powder can full of nuggets when he came home. He was old and so was his horse so he could not have gone far. She said he told her that they had struck it rich at last, but he never told mother where it was, or anyone else. Many have looked for it but none have ever found the place yet.\\" Location Thornton lived on Boundary Creek and mined many creeks in the area. Local historian Bill Barlee speculates the lost mine could not have been Rock Creek or its tributaries such as Jolly, McKinney and Baker because that round trip would require two days travel from Jack's Cabin.N.L Barlee (1976). Historic treasures and Lost Mines of British Columbia. Canada West Publications. The Kettle River and Boundary Creek could not be the location because the gold was too fine and sparse when compared to Thornton's gold. Bill Barlee believes the area where Jack found his gold was Fourth of July Creek with its tributaries. A local prospector in Greenwood named Peter den Hartog claimed he found Jolly Jack's lost mine.Basque Garnet (2000) Lost Bonanzas of Western Canada. Heritage House. The gold Hartog found in Skeff Creek matched the characteristics of Jack's gold. Skeff Creek is a tributary of Fourth of July Creek and is the reputed location of Jolly Jack's lost mine. Skeptics Some skeptics claim Thornton did not have a lost source of placer gold. E. Jacobs wrote about Thornton following his death. The account was written in the May, 1903 issue of the Mining Record. The article does not indicate that Jack ever had any secret placer location or \\"lost mine\\". Thornton lived on a periodical pension allowance from the US government. Ms. Thornton took in daywork and washing to support the family. This account does not indicate someone who had an unlimited amount of gold at their disposal. Some local prospectors believe Jolly Jack had gold stashed from older claims he once worked. This cache was to keep prospectors from spying on his tunnel operations. In 1865 Jolly Jack wing-dammed a location where Salmon Creek emptied into the Pen d‚ÄôOreille near junction with Columbia at Fort Shephard. Jack recovered a lot of gold from this location and may have cached some it. On April 3, 1903 Jack Thornton died.

Raven was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium. He was born at Broughton Astley, Leicestershire. Raven made a single first- class appearance for Sussex against Surrey at The Oval in 1874. In this match, he bowled 18 wicketless overs in Surrey's first-innings as they compiled 348 all out, while in Sussex's first-innings he batted at number eleven and was dismissed for 10 runs by James Southerton, with Sussex being dismissed for 147.

Richard Wilmer was the only bishop to be consecrated by the Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America (PECCSA). Early and family life He was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the son of the rector of Christ Church, William Holland Wilmer and his wife Marion Hannah Cox, who died in childbirth when Richard was six. His father, a prominent priest in Maryland as well as Virginia and from a family of priests, briefly served as the eleventh president of the College of William & Mary before his death in Williamsburg, Virginia when Richard was only eleven. Raised in part by his stepmother (his eldest brother dying in Mississippi shortly after his father), Richard Wilmer worked as a teenager to support his family. He graduated from Yale University in 1836 and the Virginia Theological Seminary in 1839. Career William Meade, Bishop of Virginia, ordained him as a deacon on March 31, 1839 and as a priest on April 19, 1840. He served parishes in Goochland and Fluvanna counties in Virginia, and then served as rector of St. James Church in Wilmington, North Carolina. Upon returning to Virginia, Wilmer served parishes in Clarke, Loudoun, Fauquier and Bedford counties. In 1858, he started a mission church in Henrico County which became Emmanuel Church at Brook Hill. Episcopate Shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Virginia and other states seceded from the Union, a move Wilmer supported, as eventually did Meade. Nicholas H. Cobbs, Bishop of Alabama, a slaveholder who did not support secession, died in Montgomery, Alabama on January 11, 1861, the day his state's legislature voted to secede from the Union. Weeks later, Meade and other bishops of dioceses now in Confederate states met in Montgomery and decided to form the Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America (PECCSA). A diocesan convention in Alabama voted to join the PECCSA in August, and on November 21, 1861, another Alabama diocesan meeting elected Richard Wilmer his successor. Wilmer accordingly resigned his position at Emmanuel Church effective at the years end. However, Bishops James Otey of Tennessee and Thomas Atkinson of North Carolina refused to participate in the necessary consecration ceremony before the PECCA held a convention and established its form of government. Since three bishops are needed for consecrations, the elderly and ill Meade traveled to Richmond for the consecration, and he, his assistant bishop John Johns, and bishop Stephen Elliott of Georgia, consecrated Wilmer as Bishop of Alabama on March 6, 1862 at St. Paul's Church. Meade died at a friend's house in Richmond shortly after that consecration. pp. 140-142 After the Confederacy's defeat, Wilmer's consecration was ultimately accepted by a re-united Episcopal Church, although he remained an ardent Southern nationalist. He could not attend the first General Convention after the war because he was under house arrest for instructing his clergy to omit prayers for the President of the United States as a protest against military occupation. Nonetheless, the reunited church ratified his consecration.Robert Emmet Gribbin, Jr., Henry C. Lay: Pioneer in the Southwest, (New York: The National Council, 1962) (in the Pioneer Builders in the Church pamphlet series edited by Powel Mills Dawley), pp. 20-22. Wilmer founded an order of deaconesses to care for Confederate widows and orphans, and by the time of his death in 1900, was the longest-serving Episcopal bishop. Although another Virginia priest, Henry Melville Jackson, assisted Wilmer in his last years, the diocese elected Robert Woodward Barnwell, a native of Selma, Alabama, as his successor. Death and legacy He is buried in the cemetery of Emmanuel Church at Brook Hill in Henrico County, Virginia, the parish at which he served before being called to Alabama. Libraries which hold his papers include the Birmingham Public Library, University of North Carolina, and the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland. The community of Wilmer, Alabama is named in his honor.

It featured a musical shift from the primarily piano-based sound of Martin's first record into a more \\"retro-pop\\" sound, inspired heavily by the music and style of the 1960s. Blonde was well received by critics, and was nominated for Francophone Album of the Year at the 2012 Juno Awards and longlisted for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize. The album also reached number 1 in Quebec, number 5 in France, and number 2 in the French part of Belgium, and was certified gold in both Canada and Belgium. Background Blonde is Martin's second studio album and follows her 2008 self-titled debut, which launched her career and transformed her from \\"the invisible teenager to a bit of a star\\" in both Quebec and France. In September 2010, Martin was featured on \\"Brutal Hearts\\" on the Bedouin Soundclash album Light the Horizon, which was praised by Exclaim! as a \\"surprise standout\\" of the album. In February 2011, Martin and Bedouin Soundclash singer Jay Malinowski collaborated under the name Armistice to release a five-song self-titled EP. The album's \\"blaring horns, woozy strings and skipping rhythm\\" was described as \\"aural equivalent of [a] dusty desert\\", already reflecting a change in Martin's music. Production Martin co-produced Blonde with Montreal's Howard Bilerman, known for his previous work with Arcade Fire and Basia Bulat, and recorded all but one of the album's songs in his Montreal studio, Hotel2Tango.Leijon, Erik (November 3‚Äì9, 2011). http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/Mirror/mir_111103/2011110201/10.html \\"Blonde ambition\\". Montreal Mirror 27 (21): p. 10. She chose to work with Bilerman based on his experience with folk music, and though her album \\"didn't turn out that way\\" she praised him for \\"[seeing] things in my songs that other people don't see\\". In addition, Martin worked with Edmonton singer-songwriter Michael Rault in order to achieve a more \\"sixties sound\\". The album production was praised for \\"hold[ing] back\\" on arrangements and not going \\"over-the-top orchestral\\" on the tracks \\"Cap-Diamant\\" and \\"Place de la R√©publique\\". Music and lyrics Blonde displays a stylistic change from Martin's first album, which was characterized primarily by a piano-based sound. Stating that the instrument was previously \\"the skeleton to all of my songs\\", she wanted to show that she was \\"actually more of a singer-songwriter than just the girl and the piano\\", though she clarifies that the change was not an attempt to disassociate herself from her first album but rather an \\"evolution\\" of her sound. Many reviewers noted a contrast between the positive and cheerful tone of the music and the relatively \\"heavy subjects\\" and even negative subjects of the lyrics. As one critic expressed, \\"there's a melancholy that lingers just beneath the surface... even though sonically the album is arguably one of the happiest, swingy-iest, warmest kiss-offs yet\\". The album was inspired stylistically by the work of numerous artists, especially from the 1960s, which led one reviewer to describe Martin's music as \\"straddl[ing] a line between dated and timeless\\" The album draws inspiration from the genres surf rock and y√©-y√©, and specifically the music of France Gall, Serge Gainsbourg, The Zombies, Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood. Lyrically, the album focuses on what Martin describes as \\"all the seasons of a relationship, from when you meet someone to the break up and whatever happens after\\", including \\"loving from a distance\\". This is referenced directly in the title of the album, Blonde, a double entendre that refers not only to Martin's blonde hair but also to the slang word for \\"girlfriend\\" in Quebec French. Songs Tracks 1‚Äì6 The album opens with \\"L√®ve les voiles\\", which roughly translates to \\"Raise the Sails\\" or '\\"Set Sail\\", an a cappella song written in a traditional style. Though the words and melody were written by Martin, she does not sing on the track, which features instead singers from the boys' choir Les Petits Chanteurs de Laval (Young Singers of Laval) and the girls' choir Les Voix Bor√©ales (Boreal Voices), directed by Philippe Ostiguy. Martin's inspiration for the song came from her own years in elementary school where she \\"had to sing traditional songs that meant nothing\\". Though the unaccompanied choral sound of the song is described as somewhat \\"musically incongruous\\" with the rest of the album, its lyrics of freedom and \\"setting sail onto new ways\\" set a tone for the rest of the album. \\"Adieu\\" (\\"Farewell\\"), is a 1960s-inspired pop song, featuring a double bassline and \\"stomping\\" percussion in the vein of Bo Diddley. It was released as the album's first single on September 19 and topped CBC Radio 3's The R3-30 singles chart for two consecutive weeks in November. Lyrically, \\"Adieu\\" deals with what Martin describes as the phase of \\"the break-up where you really just want the other person to disappear... you want to stop thinking about them\\", though she also clarifies that \\"it's a general break-up song, it doesn't talk about one person in particular\\". A music video for the song, directed by J√©r√©mie Saindon, features Niels Schneider as Martin's boyfriend whose infidelity provokes her to enact revenge on his various partners, and eventually him as well. The concept was inspired by the 1960s sitcom Bewitched and styled with touches of both retro and modern. The third song on the album, \\"Danse et danse\\", features a \\"wonderfully groovy\\" melody with a \\"dramatic tango\\" feel, backed by strings and a \\"thumping\\" beat. Lyrically, it deals with what Martin describes her generation's tendency to \\"try to numb ourselves\\" and move on after a break-up by \\"sleeping with different people but not really caring about them\\", alluded to in the refrain with the phrase \\"Mais danse et danse sans que j'aie √† t'aimer / Je ne t'aurai plus quand ce sera demain\\" (\\"But dance and dance without me having to love you / I will no longer have you tomorrow\\"). \\"Loin d'ici\\", meaning \\"far from here\\", is a duet sung by Martin and Juno Award- winning singer-songwriter Sam Roberts. Featuring acoustic, electric, and slide guitar, it has a distinctly country feel that prompted one reviewer to compare it to the sound of Martin's side project Armistice. The contrast between Martin's \\"softness\\" and Robert's \\"rough, dusty gruffness\\" was praised as complementary and \\"subtle and distracting in the best way imaginable\\". Tracks 7‚Äì12 \\"Place de la R√©publique\\" is a slow, \\"melancholy\\" song with a similar sound to Martin's debut album, featuring her vocals with a piano and an \\"emotive\\" and \\"subdued chamber-pop string adornment\\". Its name comes from the public square of the same name in Paris. Written almost immediately after the release of her first album, Martin said that it \\"became a symbol for whatever I was feeling afterwards ... It was defining for me\\". After adding it to her regular performance repertoire, the song was well known by Martin's fans and became a catalyst for Blonde; as Martin stated during an interview on the radio show Q: > This album is only here today because I wanted to record 'Place de la > R√©publique' ... I just had to record it for the fans, if anything ... I > mean, I've got people that like my music now, so, I might as well do this, I > might as well release a record. Named for Cap Diamant (\\"Cape Diamond\\"), the promontory on which Quebec City is located, the song \\"Cap-Diamant\\" is a piano-driven track that features Martin's vocals. Co-written by Martin and Malinowski, \\"Saint-Laurent\\" is named for the boulevard of the same name, a major commercial street and heritage site in Montreal. Release The album's first single, \\"Adieu\\", was released on September 12, 2011, along with a music video. The album itself was released on November 14, 2011 with a launch concert at the Rialto Theatre in Montreal. The second single, \\"Golden Baby\\", was released on February 27, 2012 along with an accompanying music video released shortly after. Deluxe edition A deluxe edition of the album was released concurrent with the standard edition in a limited run of 5000 copies. The edition includes a small hardcover book of about 30 pages, the album CD with two bonus tracks (\\"H√¥tel Amour\\" and \\"Prince- Arthur\\"), and a collection of photographs and images. Designed by Catherine D'Amours with photography was by Clara Palardy, the package was awarded the 2012 Concours Grafika grand prix for best CD/DVD packaging design in Quebec. Reception Blonde was well received by music critics, who described it as \\"sophisticated\\", \\"enjoyable\\", \\"radiat[ing] with jubilance and youthful verve\\" and containing \\"beautiful songs and dreamy delivery\\". Martin was mostly praised for progressing beyond the simple, piano-centric sound of her first record. Allmusic called the album as \\"a brave leap forward from a hugely gifted songwriter\\" and \\"perhaps one of the most enchanting and authentic retro-pop efforts of the year\\", while Bernard Perusse at The Gazette wrote that she \\"continues to develop an enchanting artistic voice of her own\\" and \\"makes few false moves\\" with the album, concluding that \\"it would be a mistake to bet against her ultimately becoming a bona fide pop treasure\\". In his review of the album for PopMatters, critic Stuart Henderson made similar remarks, commenting: > Blonde is, overall, a very fun, very amusing record. It has a jumping- > around-singing-into-your-hairbrush kind of girlish abandon to it that is > utterly compelling... Yet, for all of this effervescence, a superior or more > tightly constructed series of pop tracks hasn't appeared this year, for my > money. However, one reviewer did express a desire for \\"more emphasis on [Martin's] extraordinary piano playing\\" and hoped that \\"on her third release she embraces that instrumental talent more and it isn't tossed aside for pure pop\\". Awards and year-end rankings Blonde was named the best francophone album of 2011 by the Canadian iTunes Store, voted the 22nd best album of the year by the music critics at Voir and ranked fourth by Now magazine music editor Michael Hollett on his list of the top ten discs of 2011. Blonde was nominated for the Francophone album of the year at the 2012 Juno Awards, and was also named as a longlisted nominee for the 2012 Polaris Music Prize on June 14, 2012.\\"Polaris Prize long list includes lots of Toronto bands\\". Toronto Star, June 14, 2012.

Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple national and international championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, Bonfire mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses ‚Äì until she found his replacement, Salinero, she did not think she would ever find a horse to match Bonfire's talent. A statue of Bonfire stands in Van Grunsven's home town of Erp. Early life The brown Oldenburg gelding was born March 21, 1983, bred by Karl Bernd Westerholt of Lemwerder, Germany. His sire was Welt As and his dam was Warine (his dam's sire was Praefectus xx). Van Grunsven first met Bonfire when he was two and a half years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later purchased by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older. Competitive career Anky van Grunsven in 2008 Bonfire competed with Van Grunsven at his first Olympic Games (her second Games) in 1992 at the Barcelona Games. There, the pair took 4th individually, while helping the Dutch team to a silver medal. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, they repeated the team performance, while improving to take an individual silver medal. In 2000, at the Sydney Games, the pair won their first (and only) individual gold, while helping the Dutch team to a third silver medal. After the Sydney Games, Van Grunsven replaced Bonfire with Salinero as her Olympic horse. Bonfire and Van Grunsven also competed in two World Equestrian Games. The first, the 1994 The Hague Games, resulted in two medals for the pair ‚Äì an individual gold and a team silver. At the second, the 1998 World Equestrian Games in Rome, the pair took home both the individual and team silver. However, Van Grunsven considered the judging at this Games so poor that she said \\"I thought I would quit dressage.\\" In 1991, Bonfire made his European Dressage Championship debut at Donaueschingen, Germany, where he and Van Grunsven took an individual 5th, while assisting the Dutch team to a bronze medal. At the 1995 Championships in Mondorf, Luxembourg, the pair took the silver medal both individually and with the Dutch team. At the 1999 Championships at Arnhem, the Netherlands Bonfire and Van Grunsven took the title ‚Äì gold in the individual ‚Äì as well as assisting the Dutch team to another silver medal. He was also a nine-time national dressage champion in the Netherlands. Later life and legacy Statue of Gestion Bonfire in Erp As he grew older, he retained his famed elasticity but show signed of age in other areas, especially at the walk, which was his weakest skill in the dressage ring. Bonfire was retired from competition after the 2000 Olympic Games. To celebrate his retirement, there was a ceremony in Van Grunsven's home town and a farewell ride at an international jumping competition in Maastricht, Netherlands. After Bonfire's retirement, Van Grunsven stated that she never thought she would find another horse as good as he was; however, his successor Salinero proved to be even more successful. In Van Grunsven's home town of Erp there is a statue of Bonfire. As of 2012, he lived on Van Grunsven's farm in the Netherlands. Bonfire was euthanized following adrenal disease and hoof inflammation on 28 October 2013, aged 30. omroepbrabant.nl References Dressage horses Individual warmbloods Horses in the Olympics 1983 animal births Wikipedia Did you know articles that are good articles Individual male horses 2013 animal deaths ","title":"Gestion Bonfire"},{"id":"34060756","text":"Wirts House is a historic home located at Straban Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania.

Ba'athists involved in the coup as well as the subsequent purge of the moderate faction led by Naif included Hardan al-Tikriti, Salih Mahdi Ammash, and Saddam Hussein, the future President of Iraq. The coup was primarily directed against Yahya, an outspoken Nasserist who exploited the political crisis created by the June 1967 Six-Day War to push Arif's moderate government to nationalize the British- and American-owned Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) in order to use Iraq's \\"oil as a weapon in the battle against Israel.\\" Full nationalization of the IPC did not occur until 1972, under the Ba'athist administration. In the aftermath of the coup, the new Iraqi government consolidated power by denouncing alleged American and Israeli machinations, publicly executing 14 people (including 9 Iraqi Jews) on fabricated espionage charges amidst a broader purge, and working to expand Iraq's traditionally close relations with the Soviet Union. The Ba'ath Party ruled from the 17 July Revolution until 2003, when it was removed from power by an invasion led by American and British forces. The 17 July Revolution is not to be confused with the 14 July Revolution, a coup on 14 July 1958, when King Faisal II was overthrown, ending the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq and establishing the Republic of Iraq, or the 8 February 1963 Ramadan Revolution that brought the Iraqi Ba'ath Party to power for the first time as part of a short-lived coalition government that held power for less than one year. Background Under the Presidency of Abdul Rahman Arif, who assumed power following the death of his brother Abdul Salam Arif in April 1966, the United States (U.S.) and Iraq developed closer ties than at any point since the 14 July Revolution of 1958. The Lyndon B. Johnson administration favorably perceived Salam Arif's proposal to partially reverse ousted Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim's nationalization of the United Kingdom (U.K.)-based Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC)'s concessionary holding in July 1965 (although the resignation of six Nasserist cabinet members and widespread disapproval among the Iraqi public forced him to abandon this plan), as well as pro-Western lawyer Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz's brief tenure as prime minister (which straddled the presidencies of both Arif brothers); Bazzaz attempted to implement a peace agreement with Iraqi Kurdish rebels following a decisive Kurdish victory at the Battle of Mount Handren in May 1966. (American firms owned 23.75% of the IPC.) Arif was considered \\"one of the few forces of moderation\\" in Iraq, having established a friendship with U.S. ambassador Robert C. Strong prior to assuming the presidency and making a number of friendly gestures to the U.S. between April 1966 and January 1967. At Arif's request, President Johnson met five Iraqi generals and Iraqi ambassador Nasir Hani in the White House on 25 January 1967, reiterating his \\"desire to build an ever closer relationship between [the] two governments.\\" According to Johnson's National Security Adviser, Walt Whitman Rostow, the NSC even contemplated welcoming Arif on a state visit to the U.S., although this proposal was ultimately rejected due to concerns about the stability of his government. Prior to the outbreak of the Six-Day War, Iraqi Foreign Minister Adnan Pachachi met with a number of U.S. officials to discuss the escalating Middle East crisis on 1 June, including U.S. ambassador to the United Nations (UN) Arthur Goldberg, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Eugene V. Rostow, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and President Johnson himself. The political atmosphere engendered by the costly Arab defeat prompted Iraq to break relations with the U.S. on 7 June, and ultimately ensured the collapse of Arif's relatively moderate government. In May 1968, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) produced a report titled \\"The Stagnant Revolution,\\" stating that radicals in the Iraqi military posed a threat to the Arif government, and while \\"the balance of forces is such that no group feels power enough to take decisive steps,\\" the ensuing gridlock had created \\"a situation in which many important political and economic matters are simply ignored.\\" In June 1968, Belgian officials relayed a message from the U.S. State Department to Iraqi officials, offering to resume normal relations if Iraq agreed to provide compensation for damage to the U.S. embassy and consulate incurred during an earlier protest and met other conditions, including an end to the Iraqi boycott of U.S. goods and services imposed after Israel's 1967 victory; although U.S. officials were hoping to prevent a coup, there is no indication of any Iraqi response to this overture. From at least mid-1965, the Shah's Iran, Israel, and the U.K.‚Äîmotivated largely by the desire to contain Egyptian influence in the Persian Gulf‚Äîhad sought to destabilize Iraq by supporting Kurdish rebels, which the U.S. refrained from doing at the time as the Kurdish war was considered unimportant to the broader Cold War with the Soviet Union. Senior Israeli official Uri Lubrani explained the strategy: \\"The Shah believed that his Israeli connection would provide a deterrent to Arab regimes [particularly Iraq] because it would create the impression that if an Arab state were to attack Iran, Israel would take advantage of this pretext to strike Iraq's western flank.\\" While Nasserist elements had attempted to overthrow Arif as far back as Arif Abd ar-Razzaq's failed coup attempt in June 1966 (itself Razzaq's second attempt to wrest power from the regime), the Six- Day War compounded existing dissatisfaction within the Iraqi military and, combined with the stand-off with the Kurds, \\"had a profound impact on Iraq's political stability.\\" Like his brother, Arif previously tried to balance radical and moderate elements in Iraq and turned against the Nasserists after the Razzaq plot was exposed, but this balancing act was upended by the war as Arif moved to placate the ascendant Iraqi nationalists, notably by reappointing Tahir Yahya to the position of prime minister. Yahya had announced his intention to create a national oil company during his first premiership in late 1963, laying the groundwork for the Iraq National Oil Company (INOC). During his second term as prime minister from July 1967 to July 1968, Yahya moved to revitalize the INOC and sought to work with France and the Soviet Union to develop the technical capacity to nationalize the IPC outright, pledging to use Iraq's \\"oil as a weapon in the battle against Israel.\\"  The coup  Planning for a coup against Arif and Yahya was underway at least from March 1968, when the topic was discussed at an \\"officer's convention\\" held at the home of prominent Ba'athist general Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. On 17 July 1968 the Iraqi Ba'ath Party‚Äîled by al-Bakr as president, Abd ar-Rahman al-Dawud as defense minister, and Abd ar-Razzaq an- Naif as prime minister‚Äîseized power in a bloodless coup, placing Arif on a plane to London. al-Bakr quickly ordered Naif and Dawud to be removed from their posts and exiled on 30 July, cementing the Ba'ath Party's control over Iraq until the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. al-Bakr was then named prime minister and commander-in-chief of the army. According to a semi-official biography, future Iraqi president Saddam Hussein personally led Naif at gunpoint to the plane that escorted him out of Iraq. The exact circumstances leading up to the coup are shrouded in mystery. The U.S. embassy in Beirut (which became the major American source for intelligence on Iraq after the U.S. embassy in Baghdad was closed) speculated that the non-Ba'athists Naif and Dawud‚Äîwho were, respectively, in charge of President Arif's military intelligence and personal security‚Äîinitiated the plot, and that Ba'athist conspirators including al-Bakr, Hardan al-Tikriti, and Salih Mahdi Ammash were only asked to participate in order to establish a broader coalition of support for a new government. However, Brandon Wolfe-Hunnicutt states: \\"Though executed by Nayef, the coup was organised by Bakr and his deputy Saddam Hussein.\\" Both the Naif and Bakr factions were motivated by rumors that Prime Minister Yahya, who was increasingly dominating Arif's \\"weak\\" government due to the political climate engendered by the Six-Day War, planned to formally usurp all power for himself. After his ouster, Arif was exiled to the U.K., and even Yahya was not executed (although he endured brutal torture in prison), possibly to avoid the negative international attention that had resulted from the bloodletting that accompanied other changes of government in Iraq's contemporaneous history. In the ensuing years, Wolfe-Hunnicutt states that Saddam \\"succeeded in consolidating a formidable political regime ... where so many others had failed,\\" including co-opting Yahya's intention to nationalize the IPC with the help of the Soviet Union. Aftermath On 2 August 1968, Iraqi Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Sheikhli stated that Iraq would seek close ties \\"with the socialist camp, particularly the Soviet Union and the Chinese People's Republic.\\" By late November, the U.S. embassy in Beirut reported that Iraq had released many leftist and communist dissidents, although \\"there [was] no indication ... [they had] been given any major role in the regime.\\" As the Arif government had recently signed a major oil deal with the Soviets, the Ba'ath Party's rapid attempts to improve relations with Moscow were not a shock to U.S. policymakers, but they \\"provided a glimpse at a strategic alliance that would soon emerge.\\" Behind the scenes, Tikriti (now Iraqi minister of defense) attempted to open a discrete line of communication with the U.S. government through a representative of the American oil company Mobil, but this overture was rebuffed by the Johnson administration as it had come to perceive the Ba'ath Party, in both Iraq and Syria, as too closely associated with the Soviet Union. In December, Iraqi troops based in Jordan \\"made international headlines\\" when they began shelling Israeli settlers in the Jordan Valley, which led to a strong response by the Israeli Air Force. al-Bakr claimed that a \\"fifth column of agents of Israel and the U.S. was striking from behind,\\" and, on 14 December, the Iraqi government alleged it had discovered \\"an Israeli spy network\\" plotting to \\"bring about a change in the Iraqi regime,\\" arresting dozens of individuals and eventually publicly executing 14 people (including 9 Iraqi Jews) on fabricated espionage charges in January 1969. Kanan Makiya credits the hangings with helping the Ba'athist government consolidate control of Iraq, stating: \\"The terror that, from a Ba'athist viewpoint, was premature and badly handled in 1963, worked and was skillfully deployed the second time around.\\" Makiya recounts how the Ba'athist purge quickly expanded far beyond Iraq's marginalized Jewish community: \\"In 1969 alone, official executions of convicted spies (or announcements of such executions) took place at least on the following days: February 20, April 14, April 30, May 15, August 21, August 25, September 8, and November 26. The victims now were Muslim or Christian Iraqis with the occasional Jew thrown in for good measure.\\" In total, an estimated 150 people were publicly executed in Liberation Square, Baghdad from 1969‚Äì1970. On 1 June 1972, Iraq announced the complete nationalization of the IPC. This followed the April 1972 signing of the 15-year Iraqi‚ÄìSoviet Treaty of Friendship and Co-Operation by al-Bakr and Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin. According to historian Charles R. H. Tripp, the Iraqi‚ÄìSoviet Treaty upset \\"the U.S.-sponsored security system established as part of the Cold War in the Middle East,\\" leading the U.S. to finance Mustafa Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) rebels during the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War. From October 1972 until the abrupt end of the Kurdish intervention after March 1975, the CIA \\"provided the Kurds with nearly $20 million in assistance,\\" including 1,250 tons of non-attributable weaponry. While most studies credit the nationalization measures pursued by Muammar Gaddafi's Libya after September 1969 with setting the precedent that other oil-producing states would subsequently follow, Iraq's nationalization of the IPC was the largest such expropriation attempted since Iran's 1951 nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), which the U.S. and U.K. successfully thwarted. The U.S. pursued a similarly reactionary policy towards Iraq's nationalization, believing that its Western allies would agree to embargo Iraqi oil to ensure that the nationalization failed and that its allies in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)‚Äînamely Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait‚Äîwould announce a commensurate increase in production. However, the U.S. position was an extreme outlier relative to international opinion and none of the U.S.'s traditional allies, including the U.K., were willing to countenance such measures. To the contrary, OPEC took decisive steps to ensure the success of Iraq's nationalization. The IPC consortium broke down and signed an agreement to resolve its outstanding disputes with Iraq on 1 March 1973, leading to celebrations in Baghdad.

The ranking SVM algorithm was published by Thorsten Joachims in 2002.Joachims, T. (2002), \\"Optimizing Search Engines using Clickthrough Data\\", Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining The original purpose of the algorithm was to improve the performance of an internet search engine.

The Ranking SVM function uses a mapping function to describe the match between a search query and the features of each of the possible results. This mapping function projects each data pair (such as a search query and clicked web-page, for example) onto a feature space. These features are combined with the corresponding click-through data (which can act as a proxy for how relevant a page is for a specific query) and can then be used as the training data for the Ranking SVM algorithm. Generally, Ranking SVM includes three steps in the training period: # It maps the similarities between queries and the clicked pages onto a certain feature space. # It calculates the distances between any two of the vectors obtained in step 1. # It forms an optimization problem which is similar to a standard SVM classification and solves this problem with the regular SVM solver. Background Ranking Method Suppose \\\\mathbb{C} is a data set containing C elements c_i. r is a ranking method applied to \\\\mathbb{C}. Then the r in \\\\mathbb{C} can be represented as a C by C asymmetric binary matrix. If the rank of c_i is higher than the rank of c_j, i.e. r\\\\ c_i < r\\\\ c_j, the corresponding position of this matrix is set to value of \\"1\\".

Tzeras,and G. Knorz. Air/x - a rule-based multistage indexing system for large subject fields. In RIAO,1991 is required to map each query and the element of database to a feature space. Then each point in the feature space is labelled with certain rank by ranking method. Optimization problem The points generated by the training data are in the feature space, which also carry the rank information (the labels). These labeled points can be used to find the boundary (classifier) that specifies the order of them. In the linear case, such boundary (classifier) is a vector. Suppose c_i and c_j are two elements in the database and denote (c_i,c_j) \\\\in r if the rank of c_i is higher than c_j in certain ranking method r. Let vector \\\\vec w be the linear classifier candidate in the feature space. Then the ranking problem can be translated to the following SVM classification problem. Note that one ranking method corresponds to one query. \\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\mathrm{minimize:\\\\ } V(\\\\vec w, \\\\vec \\\\xi) = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\vec w \\\\cdot \\\\vec w + C_{onstant} \\\\sum{\\\\xi_{i,j,k}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ s.t. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\forall \\\\xi_{i,j,k} \\\\geqq 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\forall (c_i, c_j)\\\\in r_k^*\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vec w (\\\\Phi(q_1,c_i)-\\\\Phi(q_1, c_j)) \\\\geqq 1- \\\\xi_{i,j,1};\\\\\\\\\\\\ ...\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vec w (\\\\Phi(q_n, c_i)-\\\\Phi(q_n, c_j)) \\\\geqq 1-\\\\xi_{i,j,n};\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{where\\\\ } \\\\ k \\\\in \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,...n \\\\right \\\\\\\\},\\\\ i,j \\\\in \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,... \\\\right \\\\\\\\}.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\end{array} The above optimization problem is identical to the classical SVM classification problem, which is the reason why this algorithm is called Ranking-SVM. W candidate Not a w candidate Retrieval Function The optimal vector \\\\vec w^* obtained by the training sample is \\\\vec w^*=\\\\sum{\\\\alpha_{k,l}^*\\\\Phi(q_k,c_i)} So the retrieval function could be formed based on such optimal classifier. For new query q, the retrieval function first projects all elements of the database to the feature space. Then it orders these feature points by the values of their inner products with the optimal vector. And the rank of each feature point is the rank of the corresponding element of database for the query q. Application of Ranking SVM Ranking SVM can be applied to rank the pages according to the query. The algorithm can be trained using click-through data, where consists of the following three parts: # Query. # Present ranking of search results # Search results clicked on by user The combination of 2 and 3 cannot provide full training data order which is needed to apply the full SVM algorithm. Instead, it provides a part of the ranking information of the training data. So the algorithm can be slightly revised as follows. \\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\mathrm{minimize:\\\\ } V(\\\\vec w, \\\\vec \\\\xi) = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\vec w \\\\cdot \\\\vec w + C_{ontant} \\\\sum{\\\\xi_{i,j,k}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ s.t. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\begin{array}{lcl} \\\\forall \\\\xi_{i,j,k} \\\\geqq 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\forall (c_i, c_j)\\\\in r_k^'\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vec w (\\\\Phi(q_1,c_i)-\\\\Phi(q_1,c_j)) \\\\geqq 1- \\\\xi_{i,j,1};\\\\\\\\\\\\ ...\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vec w (\\\\Phi(q_n,c_i)-\\\\Phi(q_n,c_j)) \\\\geqq 1- \\\\xi_{i,j,n};\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{where\\\\ }\\\\ k \\\\in \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,...n \\\\right \\\\\\\\},\\\\ i,j \\\\in \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ 1,2,... \\\\right \\\\\\\\}.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\end{array} The method r' does not provide ranking information of the whole dataset, it's a subset of the full ranking method. So the condition of optimization problem becomes more relax compared with the original Ranking- SVM.

The anchor stores are Boscov's, Gold's Gym, H&M;, and Marshalls. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once The Bon-Ton. Penn National Gaming is constructing a mini-casino, Hollywood Casino York, in the lower level of a former Sears at the mall's west end, with late 2020 as a target opening date. Restaurants The food court on the upper level contains counter service restaurants. These include McDonald's, Auntie Anne's, Taco Bell, Subway, Sbarro, a Chinese restaurant named Bamboo Express, and a Japanese teriyaki restaurant known as Tokyo II. The mall's only sit-down restaurant, Ruby Tuesday, closed in 2008. A Red Robin restaurant opened in the fall of 2014 in the mall's east-side parking lot and a Texas Roadhouse restaurant is also located near the east side of the mall. Tenancy changes New stores were added at the mall in 2014 including Francesca's and rue21. In March 2014, the mall's owner, Tennessee-based CBL & Associates Properties, listed the mall for sale at an undisclosed price. In January 2015, it was announced that JCPenney would be closing as part of a plan to close 39 under- performing stores nationwide. In December 2016, H&M; moved into space that had included part of the closed JCPenney store as well as the former Bath & Body Works location. Gold's Gym opened in mid-2017 in what had been the rest of JCPenney's lower level, and in late April 2018, Marshalls opened in part of the available space above the gym. On April 19, 2018, it was announced that The Bon-Ton would be closing, as the chain was going out of business. All Bon- Ton stores were to be closed \\"within a few months\\" after that April announcement. Bon-Ton at York Galleria was fully closed by the end of August. On April 26, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing its York Galleria store in August 2018. Sears' communications director said it involved an acceleration of their previously announced closings of unprofitable stores, related to \\"store space and productivity\\". Hollywood Casino York According to Springettsbury Township officials in February 2018, Penn National Gaming expressed interest in the York Galleria area as a potential location for a mini-casino. The casino operator won the right from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to build or renovate such a facility, with up to 750 slot machines and plans for 30 table games, in the south central part of the state ‚Äì specifically, within of Yoe. The township solicitor said Penn National Gaming is looking at the first floor of the Sears property. A public hearing was held in late July 2018 for feedback on proposed ordinance changes for a potential gambling facility. Many expressed disapproval of a local casino and no one spoke in favor of the casino during the hearing. A township supervisor said residents have separately informed him of support, and after the hearing, supervisors approved related changes to the ordinances. Penn National Gaming had a September 2018 deadline to apply to the control board to open a mini- casino in York County, and confirmed that month its selection of York Galleria's former Sears store as such a site, filing an application with the Gaming Control Board on September 12, 2018. A public hearing was held on November 1, with 14 speakers including four current and former township supervisors. One resident, who said 38 neighbors shared his opinion, expressed his opposition to the casino; all others who spoke were for it. As of February 2019, the proposal remained subject to a final closed-to-the-public board hearing, at which Penn National would make a presentation. As of June 2019, Penn National was still waiting for confirmation of a date for their presentation, with the delay being attributed to this first test of state gambling laws changed in 2017, as well as the prospective casino's being the first that would be placed in a mall. A control board spokesman said a license was expected by the end of the 2019, and a Penn National spokesman said construction would begin as soon as possible after such approval, with completion estimated 12 to 18 months thereafter. In August 2019, Springettsbury Township supervisors voted their approval of Penn National's redevelopment plans for Hollywood Casino York. In October 2019, a Penn National spokesman gave the fourth quarter of 2020 as a target opening date, and the mall owner began some work on the site in anticipation of control board approval. On December 18, 2019, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board granted Penn National Gaming a license for the casino.

Class Actress was originally conceived as a trio, consisting of Harper, Mark Richardson, and Scott Rosenthal. History Formation and early years Harper majored in drama in college and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as an actress, but she was unable to make it work and soon found herself disillusioned by it. After relocating to Brooklyn, she decided to pursue a career in music instead. She formed Elizabeth Harper & the Matinee, and in 2004, Harper's self-titled debut solo album was released by UK label Angular Recording Corporation. Harper later contacted Philadelphia-based producer Mark Richardson, who had remixed a song from her debut album. She preferred Richardson's version to the original, and the two began recording songs at her house, trading Harper's previous guitar-based sound for electronic music, which she had long been interested in exploring. Along with multi-instrumentalist and engineer Scott Rosenthal, Harper and Richardson formed Class Actress‚Äîthe name being a joke on Harper's original career choice. 2009‚Äì2012: Journal of Ardency and Rapprocher Class Actress released their debut extended play, Journal of Ardency, on February 9, 2010 on Terrible Records, which is run by Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor. The New York Times described it as \\"an alluringly precise recapturing of the winning chill of early '80s electro-pop\\". The EP also drew comparisons to New Order, The Human League, and Depeche Mode, while Harper's vocals were likened to those of Blondie's Debbie Harry and Saint Etienne's Sarah Cracknell. The trio's debut studio album, Rapprocher, was released on October 18, 2011 by Carpark Records. Harper stated that the title‚Äîwhich means \\"to come closer\\" in French‚Äîwas inspired by \\"a French lover who broke [her] heart\\". The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, obtaining a rating of 69 out of 100 based on 16 critics on review aggregate site Metacritic. AllMusic named it one of the best indie pop and rock albums of 2011. Rapprocher reached number 21 on Billboards Dance/Electronic Albums chart and number 27 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. The song \\"Keep You\\" was used in an episode of the fifth season of the teen drama television series Gossip Girl. 2013‚Äì2015: Movies As a solo artist under the moniker Class Actress, Harper signed to Casablanca Records in 2013. That same year, she moved into a bungalow at The Beverly Hills Hotel in order to write and record songs. Class Actress premiered the track \\"More Than You\\" on May 20, 2015, and on June 2, it was announced that her EP Movies would be released on June 23 via Casablanca and Republic Records. Taking inspiration from \\"the films of '80s excess, glamor and self-discovery\\", Harper wanted Movies to tell \\"a dark story of a woman who explores the glamorous fantasy life of a Hollywood party girl.\\" The EP was executive-produced by Giorgio Moroder and Evan Bogart, and features production by Harper herself, Moroder, Neon Indian, and Mess Kid. 2016‚Äìpresent: New music On June 30, 2016, Class Actress premiered a song titled \\"Glass Ceiling\\", along with an accompanying music video, through Terrible Records.

The book was published in May 2010 by Atlantic Books in the UK and June 2011 by Twelve, an imprint of Hachette Book Group USA, and was later nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award. The planned worldwide tour for the book was cut short later the same month during the American leg so that the author could begin treatment for newly diagnosed esophageal cancer.Peters, Jeremy. \\"Christopher Hitchens to Begin Cancer Treatment\\", The New York Times, 30 June 2010. Through the book's publisher and in the magazine for which he was a regular contributing editor, Vanity Fair, Hitchens announced: 'I regret having had to cancel so many engagements at such short notice.' Description Hitchens initially found the book hard to write: 'I found it fantastically difficult. Normally, when I'm writing, I'm making an argument, making a case. Also, when I'm writing, I'm trying to see how much I can pack into 5,000 words about a subject. But here's a subject I know too much about.' But he eventually produced a manuscript that was twice the length of the version finally published. Hitchens used his memoir to discuss several incidents that were later picked up by reviewers and the media as notable for their revelatory nature: as a contemporary at Oxford University of the then- student Bill Clinton (who later became the American President), he knew that Clinton's later avowal that 'I did not inhale' in regard to marijuana was based on Clinton's allergy to smoke; but Hitchens also states that Clinton's consumption was via 'cookies and brownies'; that during the writing of Martin Amis's novel, Money, Hitchens and Amis visited a New York brothel so that Amis could research the experience; that during an encounter at a party with the then British Leader of the Opposition, Margaret Thatcher, she proceeded to 'spank Hitchens directly on the buttocks' and call him a 'Naughty boy!' New foreword The paperback edition of the book, published in 2011, featured a new foreword by Hitchens which mentions his newly diagnosed cancer: \\"I suffer from Stage Four oesophageal cancer,\\" he writes. \\"There is no Stage Five.\\" And \\"I hope it will not seem presumptuous to assume that anybody likely to have got as far as acquiring this paperback edition of my memoir will know that it was written by someone who, without appreciating it at the time, had become seriously and perhaps mortally ill... When the book was published, I had just turned sixty-one. I am writing this at a moment when, according to my doctors, I cannot be certain of celebrating another birthday.\\" Critical reception Comments from critic Dwight Garner's article in The New York Times Book Review are quoted on the back cover. \\"Electric and electrifying... He has a mind like a Swiss Army knife, ready to carve up or unbolt an opponent's arguments with a flick of the wrist.\\" and \\"It is a fascinating, funny, sad, incisive, and serious narrative...' by Alexander Waugh of The Spectator. Hitchens died of esophageal cancer in 2011, aged 62. His autobiography received positive reviews, and some critics felt his prose was impressive and wit was incisive.

The traditional celebration began in 19th century or earlier, and ceased when it was banned by the Turkish authorities in 1943. However, beginning in 2010 there has been a revival initiative. Carnival For almost five centuries, the local Greek communities throughout Istanbul (former Constantinople) celebrated pre-Lent festivals with colorful events that included bawdy parades and parties held indoors and in the street. These lasted for weeks before the 40-day Lent period. Baklahorani, on Shrove Monday, the last day of the carnival season before Lent, became the culminating event in the mid-19th century. It started as a masked parade that proceeded through Istanbul's Greek neighborhoods, beginning with the elite area of Pera and gathering people along the way before proceeding finally to Tatavla (now Kurtulu≈ü) for festivities on the square at the Church of Saint Demetrius. The name of the event literally translates as 'I eat beans', a reference to Lenten dietary restrictions. Although the event was led by local Greeks, the celebrations were not limited among the Greek community of the city, but were open to everyone. It was also an opportunity to bring together people from various neighborhoods, while they gathered for the final celebrations in the Kurtulu≈ü, a neighbourhood in ≈ûi≈üli district that time known as Tataula and nicknamed Little Athens. The masked parade marched the route dancing tsamiko and Anatolian folk dances, accompanied by various traditional instruments, like drum, zurna, clarinet and mandolin. Residents from Bakƒ±rk√∂y, Samatya, Fener, Balat crossed the Golden Horn on the Galata and Unkapanƒ± Bridge, and then from Pera they reached dancing the large square opposite Saint Demetrius Church in Kurtulu≈ü. On the other hand, another group of people from neighborhoods at Bosphorus, ≈ûi≈üli, Kemerburgaz gathered in front of the Pangaltƒ± Catholic Cemetery and marched through the main street to the same square, where the celebrations culminated. Young Greek men often wore the traditional fustanella costume, put on fake beards or moustaches, and painted their faces with flour or coal powder. Women often dressed in low-cut garments. Maria Iordanidou described Bakalahorani in her 1963 novel Loxandra, which tells the story of a young Greek woman of Constantinople in the earliest years of the 20th century. According to her description, people \\"from all over Istanbul\\" gathered in Tatavla, singing folk songs along their route. She wrote that: \\"Groups of young girls sang songs and children swung on gondolier swings or ride merry- go-rounds decorated with bands and flags. The young men of Tatavla would give displays of their unique dances and games.\\" The carnival reached its peak of popularity after World War I, during the years of the Allied Occupation of the city (1918‚Äì1922). It continued after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey until World War II. Prohibition and revival Baklahorani was one of the most famous festivals by the Christians in Istanbul until its last celebration in 1941. After that, Greeks, along with the city's other non- Muslim communities, were subject to social and financial discrimination. A law banning people from wearing masks ended the original Baklahorani carnival in 1943. In 2010, nearly 70 years after the last celebration, the historical carnival was revived by a celebrating group of Greeks and Turks who sang, danced and paraded in costumes through the streets of ≈ûi≈üli district. Principal organizers of the festival's reincarnation were H√ºseyin Irmak, a researcher who was born in Kurtulu≈ü, and Haris Theodorelis Rigas, a Greek who now lives in Istanbul, where he plays music in taverns, specializing in a \\"near-extinct\\" style of music blending Greek and Turkish influences. Irmak and Rigas consider the reestablishment of the carnival to be an opportunity for people to rediscover Turkey's multicultural past, while adding \\"colour\\" to people's lives. Due to concerns about security, the 2010 celebration was conducted on a small scale without advance announcements, but the 2011 celebration was a \\"full-scale\\" public event.

She was raped by her cousin's husband in 2009 and became pregnant. She was then charged with adultery, a crime in Afghanistan. She was initially sentenced to two years in jail, which was later raised to twelve, and she gave birth to a daughter in jail. The American lawyer Kimberley Motley represented her and successfully submitted a pardon application to President Hamid Karzai. More than five thousand people signed the petition for Gulnaz's release. On December 2, 2011 President Karzai signed her pardon. Gulnaz complained to authorities that her cousin's husband had raped her only after she began vomiting - a sign of pregnancy - in order to avoid social stigma and family conflicts. The Afghan authorities sentenced her to 12 years in jail. This decision resulted in world-wide criticism for Afghanistan's abysmal human rights record. The entire world outside Afghanistan came to know her plight when the European Union blocked the broadcast of a documentary about her ordeal. This attracted international attention, shock, and criticism from human rights activists. Her case caused alarm. It highlighted the plight of many Afghan women serving similar sentences in prison - even after the overthrow of Taliban government. Reports then came out that she had agreed to marry her attacker to gain freedom and legitimize her daughter. The reports were confirmed false when President Karzai gave Gulnaz an unconditional pardon and she was not required to marry her attacker. Documentary film Gulnaz's story was included in a European Union documentary on Afghan women jailed for zina (moral crimes). However, the European Union blocked the release of the documentary because of concerns for the safety of the portrayed women. Human rights activists wanted to expose injustices meted out to Afghan women, in the name of moral crimes, by the Afghan judicial system. Amnesty International wanted the release of documentary to bring to light one of Afghanistan's most shameful judicial practices. Accountability for her plight Gulnaz's case not only attracted international attention, but also posed primitive questions about the veracity of governance in Afghanistan. Speaking to the BBC correspondent Caroline Wyatt, Gulnaz said, \\"I don't want to have anything to do with Afghanistan government again, because they put innocent people in prison. What kind of government is this? What kind of Afghanistan is this? My attacker committed a crime, and they arrested me!\\" Her future Speaking to BBC correspondent Caroline Wyatt, a local said, \\"If she went home, her brothers would kill her because of the shame she brought on her family.\\" However, she is willing to marry the rapist to preserve her family's honour. She said, \\"I'll marry him, if his family finds a wife for my brother and pays dowry to me. There is no other way, if the families can't agree each other, they will become enemies.\\" Speaking to CNN's correspondent Fareed Zakaria, President Hamid Karzai said her case appeared to be a \\"misjudgment\\" which he had resolved by pardoning her. He further added, it's her choice who she marries or who she doesn't marry. He claimed Islam gives her that right. Karzai also promised the West that he would make sure that there is no \\"miscarriage\\" of justice once the international forces withdraw. His aim is to make Judiciary distinguish rape and adultery. Kimberly Motley, Gulnaz's lawyer, said Afghanistan treats women as second-class citizens. Women are often mistreated by Afghanistan's Judicial system as illustrated with Gulnaz case. Only time will tell if Gulnaz's conservative family will accept her and her child, Masqa, and whether she will marry the rapist who is in prison at present or not. Criticism According to Heather Barr from Human Rights Watch, who is carrying out research among Afghan female prisoners said that many of the women prisoners were victims of abuse by husbands, relatives and also by those who are supposed to protect them, namely state apparatus including the police and judiciary. According to Vygaudas Usackas, the EU's Ambassador and Special Representative to Afghanistan], in spite of it having been 10 years since the overthrow of the Taliban regime, Afghan women continue \\"to suffer in unimaginable conditions, deprived of even the most basic human rights\\". Bilal Sarwary, from BBC in Kabul, says the recent cases of violence against women in the Afghan region are embarrassing for the government]. Afghan women's rights activists are also demanding an end to the culture of impunity. Muslim women critics are highlighting the negligence of Afghan officials in prosecuting rape cases and beatings suffered by women, in spite of new laws being brought in. They say that indictments were filed on just 155 occasions out of 2,299 incidents of violence against women. They also allege that despite reforms being brought in by President Karzai which are backed up by western countries after the overthrow of the Taliban government, the laws to eliminate violence against women are not enforced. When the CNN correspondent spoke to a spokesman of the prosecutor to comment on the case he replied that \\"there are hundreds of such cases pending\\".

Although their 2010 single \\"Hands\\" was originally reported not to appear on the album, the duo confirmed on Twitter that it would appear on the deluxe edition of the album. The band revealed that they scrapped an entire album after \\"stumbl[ing] on this new sound\\" during a visit to Spain. The band launched a contest called Show Us Yours, which gave artists and graphic designers the chance to create art and videos to show the band. One piece of art by artist Milan Abad showed both Katie White and Jules De Martino as skeletons, which caught the band's attention and ultimately became the album's artwork. White stated that other entries would be placed in the album insert. Sounds from Nowheresville debuted at number twenty-three on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 6,246 copies.

According to De Martino: \\"We had to find a new challenge and going to hide away in Berlin was the perfect place because our friends aren't there, our families aren't there and our record company isn't there, so no one really bothered us.

The duo were reportedly assisted by labelmate and Barbadian-R&B; star Rihanna, who contributed vocals to a track. The album featured a mix of styles, with the band aiming for a 'playlist' feel.

In an interview with Digital Spy, White said, \\"We were in Berlin where there is a great electro scene, and so we made songs like that, but quickly realised that everything on the radio was Euro-pop shite. We didn't want our record to be tarnished with that brush.\\" De Martino continued, \\"We scrapped six of the ten songs, which upset quite a few people. We put out 'Hands', which was meant to be an underground, white label-only release and it ended up being playlisted on Radio 1‚Äîwe were quite angry so erased over half the album.\\" They also insisted that they \\"found [their] feet\\" with their new album, adding, \\"No-one would give a shit if we'd made a shit Euro-pop song, even if it went top ten.\\" The album was recorded in Berlin, London, Murcia and Ibiza.

Hang it Up experience the most commercial success in Japan peaking at number eight failing to chart in other countries, ending as a commercial failure. A music video for the Bag Raiders remix of \\"Silence\\" was directed by Dan Gable and filmed at Salford Lads Club in Manchester in July 2011. The video premiered on 21 November 2011. The album's second official single, \\"Hit Me Down Sonny\\", was added to the BBC Radio 1 C List on 2 May 2012. A four-track EP for the single was released digitally on 25 May 2012.

On 13 January 2012, the duo reported via Twitter that they were filming a video for \\"Help\\" in Manchester. However, the video was never released. Critical reception Sounds from Nowheresville received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 52, based on 30 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Andy Gill of The Independent praised the album as \\"a masterclass in modern pop creation, pinballing from style to style without endangering their essential 'TingTingness'\\". The Daily Telegraphs Andrew Perry wrote that the album \\"sounds anything but laboured\\", concluding, \\"Whatever the style, White and de Martino [...] know how to knock a tune together and have delivered a pop party album thrillingly in tune with contemporary listening habits.\\" Rolling Stones Jody Rosen opined that on Sounds from Nowheresville, \\"the band again is at its best when White is proclaiming [...] and dissing [...] in a voice pitched somewhere between cheerleader, rapper and Tourette's sufferer.\\" Allmusic editor Heather Phares, however, felt that the \\"scrappy pop of their first album is largely [...] replaced by a glossy eclecticism that, for better or worse, feels labored over.\\" Phares continued, \\"Sounds from Nowheresville shows that the Ting Tings have more range than their debut suggested, but while it's more ambitious and crafted, it's just not as coherent as We Started Nothing.\\" The A.V. Clubs Dan Weiss commented the album is \\"a blast when it's on and imminently forgettable when it's not\\". In a review for the NME, Fraser McAlpine dubbed it a \\"lukewarm hotchpotch of an album\\", adding that \\"[t]he unfortunate irony is that Sounds From Nowheresville doesn't sound much like a grand rejection of pop music at all. It just sounds a little bereft of ideas, and way too short.\\" Stephen Foster of PopMatters characterised the album as \\"sluggish, self-conscious, and seemingly deliberately bad\\", while noting that \\"[t]he best Nowheresville has to offer is 'Hit Me Down Sonny', a band march of a song that offers up goofily incoherent lyrics but possess the energy and verve [...] of the best work from We Started Nothing.\\" Simon Jay Catling of Drowned in Sound expressed that \\"despite the fact that the production glitters with the high attention-seeking compression of pop music, any explorations haven't gone as far as finding any memorable hooks‚Äîand the ones which do stick in the mind do more so for their sheer irritable inanity\\", citing tracks like \\"Silence\\", \\"One by One\\" and \\"In Your Life\\" as \\"decent moments\\". The Guardians Alexis Petridis stated that Sounds from Nowheresville \\"keeps doing the things bands do when they don't really know what to do: concentrating on riffs instead of melodies, production dynamics instead of songs. The result is an album that sounds simultaneously hefty and vaporous.\\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine panned the album as \\"tuneless\\" and \\"inert\\", and found that its songs \\"aren't noteworthy in terms of content or construction, nor do they resolve into any kind of coherent aesthetic that would give context as to what it is the Ting Tings are really after.\\" Pitchfork Media's Hari Ashurst critiqued that \\"[t]he restless genre- hopping vibe makes this feel less like an album and more like a series of tracks written to briefs [...] The only common thread is how uniformly bad everything is.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits for the deluxe edition of Sounds from Nowheresville adapted from liner notes. * Katie White ‚Äì vocals, guitar * Jules De Martino ‚Äì drums, vocals, guitar, producer (all tracks); engineer (2, 6, 8); mixing (4, 5) * The Ting Tings ‚Äì design * James Abacus ‚Äì remix (14) * Bag Raiders ‚Äì remix, additional production, keyboards (11) * CKB ‚Äì remix (19) * Graeme Durham ‚Äì mastering (1‚Äì11, 13, 15, 17, 18) * David Eggar ‚Äì cello (10) * Calvin Harris ‚Äì mixing (15) * Andy Hayes ‚Äì design * Inertia ‚Äì remix (12) * Manny Marroquin ‚Äì mixing (9, 13) * Mike Marsh ‚Äì mastering (1‚Äì11, 13, 15, 17, 18) * Nilesh Patel ‚Äì mastering (1‚Äì11, 13, 15, 17, 18) * Shook ‚Äì remix, additional production, keyboards (17) * Chris Snow ‚Äì engineer (3‚Äì5); mixing (3, 4, 10); extra guitar (3) * Andy Taylor ‚Äì remix, additional production (16) * Marcos Tovar ‚Äì engineer (1, 7, 9, 10, 15) * Dave Turner ‚Äì mastering (12, 14, 16, 19) * Alex Vargas ‚Äì remix (14) * Jeremy Wheatley ‚Äì mixing (1, 2, 6‚Äì8) Charts { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2012) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"Australian Albums Chart 51 - !scope=\\"row\\"Austrian Albums Chart 30 - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgian Albums Chart (Flanders) 67 - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia) 46 - !scope=\\"row\\"Dutch Albums Chart 53 - !scope=\\"row\\"French Albums Chart 59 - !scope=\\"row\\"German Albums Chart 50 - !scope=\\"row\\"Irish Albums Chart 44 - !scope=\\"row\\"Japanese Albums Chart 49 - !scope=\\"row\\"Scottish Albums Chart 29 - !scope=\\"row\\"Spanish Albums Chart 100 - !scope=\\"row\\"Swiss Albums Chart 12 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Albums Chart 23 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard 200 87 } Release history { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Region !scope=\\"col\\"Date !scope=\\"col\\"Label - !scope=\\"row\\"Australia rowspan=\\"3\\"24 February 2012 rowspan=\\"2\\"Sony Music - !scope=\\"row\\"Germany - !scope=\\"row\\"Ireland rowspan=\\"2\\"Columbia Records - !scope=\\"row\\"United Kingdom 27 February 2012 - !scope=\\"row\\"Italy 6 March 2012 Sony Music - !scope=\\"row\\"United States 13 March 2012 Columbia Records - !scope=\\"row\\"Japan 28 March 2012 Sony Music } References 2012 albums Columbia Records albums The Ting Tings albums ","title":"Sounds from Nowheresville"},{"id":"34061266","text":"Georg Liebling in 1890s Georg Liebling (22 January 1865 - 7 February 1946) was a German pianist and composer.

Wiggins (September 19, 1928 ‚Äì October 13, 2001)Trudy Suggs, \\"Silent News founder Julius Wiggins dies at 73\\", November 1, 2001. was the founder of Silent News, the first newspaper for the deaf. Personal life He was born in North York, Ontario, Canada, and attended Belleville School for the Deaf in Belleville, Ontario. Later he transferred to a vocational school focusing on tailoring skills. Once he was at the trade school, his father who was in the fur business saw much potential in Julius. His father then took him under his wing and they began working alongside another. Later he met Harriet Berkowitz in New York City at a deaf event; he then asked for her hand in marriage. They married on March 23, 1952. Harriet and Julius worked hand in hand in the production of Silent News. They were married for 49 years and had three children. He loved to travel with his family. Throughout his life, they explored many different countries. He believed that high visibility was key to gathering information for the newspaper (Trudy). He was active in promoting organizations to the deaf community. The organizations he was a part of include \\"Temple Beth Or of the Deaf in Queens New York\\", the Philadelphia Hebrew Association of the Deaf, New York Hebrew Association of the Deaf, and Brooklyn Hebrew Society of the Deaf. He was not only active in the organizations listed above he was also a member of the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf. Career At 20 years of age, Wiggins moved to New York City to further his career in the fur business and worked at the Manhattan fur district. It was hard for him as a deaf man to have equal opportunities in the workplace. But with his dedication and determination, he worked his way to the top of his company. Once the fur market plummeted, he became unemployed. Later he found a job at a postal service. He found the job to be tedious and was ridiculed by his hearing co- workers. It was not until he took a family trip that his career path dramatically changed. On the family vacation, he saw a sign that said, \\"Who, What, Where, and Why.\\" That inspired him with ideas for the future of the deaf community. He was able to get 10 of his closest deaf friends together to organize and fund a paper company geared towards the deaf and hard of hearing community that would soon be known as Silent News. Each invested $250.00 into the company (Rachel). Soon after, Silent News was born in January 1969. Each issue was 15 cents. His family played a vital role in the production of the newspaper in the first year. The headquarters for the newspaper were in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. Wiggins held a huge role in connecting the deaf community and allowing them to be aware of upcoming events and news. The newspaper brought national and international news, latest technology, health and sports, and stories about successful and up in coming deaf people. Later he wrote an autobiography called No Sound, published in 1972, which recounted in depth about many hardships he encountered with hearing individuals and the oppression he felt throughout his life (Trudy). Silent News has left an everlasting footprint for the future of the deaf community. In the 1990s due to his failing health the newspaper was sold to Adele Wiggins. Soon after he died on October 13, 2001. Silent News Wiggins and his family moved from North York, Ontario to a home in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where they intended to start a newspaper for the deaf.Matsumoto, Lori. \\"No Sound speaks up for the world of silence\\", 'The Mirror, July 5, 1970.

He and his wife and three children lived on Acton Avenue in Downsview for 10 years before moving to Fair Lawn, New Jersey to begin publishing Silent News a year and a half ago.\\" The first issue of Silent News was launched on January 1, 1969, its focus being to bring awareness to events, news, sports, etc. for the deaf. The newspaper would have about 7,000 subscribers per month but in actuality more than 30,000 would be reading (Jamie). This was due to people passing around the paper. This hindered the newspaper greatly; it did not allow the newspaper he profit to succeed. Even though the newspaper struggled throughout the years it managed to survive and outlast its competition. With the technological advances, Silent News began to expand to the web. The subscribers decreased soon after and in return Silent News came to an end. Silent News changed the life of many deaf people throughout the years. It was an iconic media device. It was the first media outlet geared towards the deaf, opening the door to many other media outlets for the deaf.

Life and work Kadets was born in Kiev. In 1943, he was drafted into the army. After demobilisation in 1946, he studied at Kharkov University, graduating in 1950. After several years in Makeevka he returned to Kharkov in 1957, where he spent the remainder of his life working at various institutes. He defended his PhD in 1955 (under the supervision of Boris Levin), and his doctoral dissertation in 1963. He was awarded the State Prize of Ukraine in 2005. After reading the Ukrainian translation of Banach's monograph Th√©orie des op√©rations lin√©aires,The French original was translated as he became interested in the theory of Banach spaces.: In 1966, Kadets solved in the affirmative the Banach‚ÄìFr√©chet problem, asking whether every two separable infinite-dimensional Banach spaces are homeomorphic. He developed the method of equivalent norms, which has found numerous applications. For example, he showed that every separable Banach space admits an equivalent Fr√©chet differentiable norm if and only if the dual space is separable. Together with Aleksander Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski, he obtained important results on the topological structure of Lp spaces. Kadets also made several contributions to the theory of finite-dimensional normed spaces. Together with M. G. Snobar (1971), he showed that every n-dimensional subspace of a Banach space is the image of a projection of norm at most . Together with V. I. Gurarii and V. I. Matsaev, he found the exact order of magnitude of the Banach‚ÄìMazur distance between the n-dimensional spaces and .

Fisheries  The blackbelly rosefish is the most commercial scorpionfish species in the Mediterranean. Although there has been little commercial interest in this species, partially due to its low level of accessibility, it is currently growing as new resources need to be found by fishing fleets due to the depletion of traditional resources. This species is a common bycatch associated with many demersal fisheries, including the black spot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo).Hureau, J. C., Litvinenko, N. I. 1986. Scorpaenidae.

It is caught by artisanal longline and gillnet fisheries near the Strait of Gibraltar, and along the Portuguese continental coast and the Azores. In the western Mediterranean, blackbelly rosefish are mostly caught as bycatch in bottom trawl fisheries targeted at deep-sea crustaceans.Moranta, J., E. Massut√≠ & B. Morales-Nin, 2000.

In data processing, it is also known as data normalization and is generally performed during the data preprocessing step. Motivation Since the range of values of raw data varies widely, in some machine learning algorithms, objective functions will not work properly without normalization. For example, many classifiers calculate the distance between two points by the Euclidean distance. If one of the features has a broad range of values, the distance will be governed by this particular feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the final distance. Another reason why feature scaling is applied is that gradient descent converges much faster with feature scaling than without it. Methods Rescaling (min-max normalization) Also known as min-max scaling or min- max normalization, is the simplest method and consists in rescaling the range of features to scale the range in [0, 1] or [‚àí1, 1]. Selecting the target range depends on the nature of the data. The general formula for a min-max of [0, 1] is given as: x' = \\\\frac{x - \\\\text{min}(x)}{\\\\text{max}(x)-\\\\text{min}(x)} where x is an original value, x' is the normalized value. For example, suppose that we have the students' weight data, and the students' weights span [160 pounds, 200 pounds]. To rescale this data, we first subtract 160 from each student's weight and divide the result by 40 (the difference between the maximum and minimum weights). To rescale a range between an arbitrary set of values [a, b], the formula becomes: x' = a + \\\\frac{(x - \\\\text{min}(x))(b-a)}{\\\\text{max}(x)-\\\\text{min}(x)} where a,b are the min-max values. Mean normalization x' = \\\\frac{x - \\\\text{average}(x)}{\\\\text{max}(x)-\\\\text{min}(x)} where x is an original value, x' is the normalized value. There is another form of the means normalization which is when we divide by the standard deviation which is also called standardization. Standardization (Z-score Normalization) In machine learning, we can handle various types of data, e.g. audio signals and pixel values for image data, and this data can include multiple dimensions. Feature standardization makes the values of each feature in the data have zero-mean (when subtracting the mean in the numerator) and unit-variance. This method is widely used for normalization in many machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks). The general method of calculation is to determine the distribution mean and standard deviation for each feature. Next we subtract the mean from each feature. Then we divide the values (mean is already subtracted) of each feature by its standard deviation. x' = \\\\frac{x - \\\\bar{x}}{\\\\sigma} Where x is the original feature vector, \\\\bar{x}=\\\\text{average}(x) is the mean of that feature vector, and \\\\sigma is its standard deviation. Scaling to unit length Another option that is widely used in machine-learning is to scale the components of a feature vector such that the complete vector has length one. This usually means dividing each component by the Euclidean length of the vector: :x' = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\left\\\\{x}\\\\right\\\\} In some applications (e.g., histogram features) it can be more practical to use the L1 norm (i.e., taxicab geometry) of the feature vector. This is especially important if in the following learning steps the scalar metric is used as a distance measure.  Application  In stochastic gradient descent, feature scaling can sometimes improve the convergence speed of the algorithm . In support vector machines, it can reduce the time to find support vectors. Note that feature scaling changes the SVM result .

Geography The creek's source located at the confluence of Walnut Creek and Yeguas Creek in San Luis Obispo County, west of the Temblor Range and east of the Carrizo Plain in the San Andreas Fault rift zone. It flows northwest in the rift zone, then northeast through the Temblor Range and passing south of the Shale Hills, into Antelope Valley 4 miles southeast of Point of Rocks. History Arroyo de Matarano was a water stop on the 19th century El Camino Viejo in Alta California, between the stops of Aguaje Del Diablo to the south and Las Tinajas de Los Indios to the north, and east of Point of Rocks. This stream was named for Juan Matarano, a well known mid 19th century Mexican Californio meste√±ero or \\"mustang runner\\" of the west side of the southern San Joaquin Valley region. The Corral de Matarano was named after him,Frank Forrest Latta, Joaqu√≠n Murrieta And His Horse Gangs, Bear State Books, Santa Cruz, 1980, pp. 84, 454 and lay below the mouth of the Arroyo. It was in a sandstone formation that made a natural stone corral. Openings in the enclosure were blocked by man made low stone walls, and was used to corral horses, cattle and sheep. Water at the corral could usually only be found upstream 8 miles to the west at Ceder Canyon, a mile more distant than the water at Las Tinajas de Los Indios.Frank F. Latta, \\"EL CAMINO VIEJO √° LOS ANGELES\\" - The Oldest Road of the San Joaquin Valley; Bear State Books, Exeter, 2006, p.10 The name Arroyo de Matarano was officially changed to Bitterwater Creek, for the taste of its waters, in March 1909 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.

It is well known for its diverse echinoderm and trilobite fossil fauna.  Location  The Bromide Formation crops out in the Arbuckle and Wichita Mountains and in the Criner Hills of Southern Oklahoma. It appears at the surface in particular within Carter, Johnston, Murray and Pontotoc counties (34.0¬∞ N, 97.0¬∞ W).Amsden, T.W. Upper Bromide Formation and Viola Group (Middle and Upper Ordovician in Eastern Oklahoma). Part I ‚Äì Welling-Fite-Corbin-Ranch-Strata. Oklahoma Geological Survey. Bulletin 132 (1983)  Stratigraphy  The Bromide Formation is the uppermost part of the Simpson Group, and originates from the Upper Ordovician (early Sandbian). This mostly carbonate succession is divided into the Mountain Lake and overlying Pooleville members. Although it primarily consists of limestone, limestone interbedded with shale, and sandstone, also occur.Viola Limestone and Bromide Formation. Mineral Resources On-Line Spatial Data. U.S. Geological Survey The Bromide Formation is a shallow water marine sediment.Bauer, J.A. Conodonts from the Bromide Formation (Middle Ordovician), South-Central Oklahoma. Journal of Paleontology 68-2 (1994). Much of the Mountain Lake Member comprises meter-scale, deep ramp cycles that overlie a lowstand systems tract of sandstones and sandy crinoidal grainstones. Cycle tops are starved surfaces with irregular, mineralized hardgrounds. The Pooleville Member consists of an early highstand interval of shallow subtidal carbonates and late highstand peritidal carbonates (Corbin Ranch Submember). Down-ramp, the Pooleville is represented largely by centimeter-thick shales and interbedded lime mudstones.  Economic use  The Bromide Formation has been a source of oil and gas, with exploration slightly north of the area where the formation is exposed. 4√ó2¬Ω cm of fossil sea floor, from the Bromide Formation. The dark brownish thallus to the left is the green algae Ischadites iowensis, on top of it and to the top of the picture is the pygidium and back part of the thorax of the Corynexochid trilobite Nanillaenus punctatus, to the right is the cephalon of the Harpetid trilobite Dolichoharpes reticulata  Origin  The Bromide Formation was deposited in a shallow, storm-dominated epeiric sea that extended over part of the Laurentia continent, in what is today Southern Oklahoma. The sea spread into an area that sunk into a rift, that ultimately did not endure, a so-called aulacogen. Lying approximately at 30¬∞ Southern latitude, a low-land desert bordered much of the shallow sea from where well-rounded quartz sand blew in. This now represents the sandstone at the base of the Bromide Formation. Eventually, sea level rise caused by subsidence drowned the borderlands cutting off the supply of sand, and now the shales and limestones of the Middle Bromide (upper Mountain Lake Member) accumulated on a broad ramp. Gradually ‚Äì primarily echinoderm ‚Äì skeletons build up a carbonate shelf. Further eustatic sea level rise (transgression) cut off the supply of virtually all sediments from land, and remains of carbonate-producing organisms began filling the basin. This now forms the limestone of the upper Bromide (Pooleville Member). Finally, a drop in sea level (regression) exposed the entire platform, and became a broad, nearly featureless, hot, semi-arid sabkha.Longman, M.W. Deposition of the Bromide Formation, Arbuckle Mountains, Oklahoma: Ontogeny of an Ancient Carbonate Shelf. Oklahoma City Geological Society Volume, pp. 268-285 (1982).  Fossils  Fossils have been found in the Bromide Formation of green algae, sponges, corals, graptolites, lampshells, moss animals, trilobites, clam shrimps, molluscs, several groups of echinoderms, and teeth of jawless fish.

This cathedral is the fourth church and third cathedral to be located on this site over the centuries. Overview Kristiansand Cathedral is a Neo-Gothic church built of brick and cement, of cruciform plan with 1,750 seats. The church was designed by the architect Henrik Thrap-Meyer. Construction began in 1880 and was completed on 1 February 1885. The church was consecrated on 18 March 1885 by the provost Johan M. Brun who was serving as acting bishop. The cathedral is long and wide. The steeple is in height. Originally the cathedral had 2,029 seats and room for an additional 1,216 people to stand, but seating has now been reduced so the building can comfortably seat about 1,000. To re-use the walls of the previous cathedral, which burned down in 1880, the altar was positioned at the west end, rather than in the traditional position in the east. The cathedral received a carillon with 36 bells as a gift from Falconbridge Nikkelverk in 1990, created by Olsen Nauen Bell Foundry.Kristiansand Domkirke ‚Äì en kort historisk beskrivelse from the Official Website Kristiansand Cathedral received a new church organ, built by the German supplier Klais in 2013, comprising a 58-voice main organ at the eastern balcony and another of 9 voices at the northern balcony. History The previous Kristiansand Cathedral, built 1738, burned down 1880 (Image:Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage) The cathedral is in the same location as three previous buildings. The first, called (Trinity Church), a small wooden church, was built in 1645. When Kristiansand was appointed the seat of the diocese in 1682, construction began on the town's first cathedral, called (Our Saviour's Church). That first cathedral, built in stone, was consecrated in 1696, but burned down in 1734. The second cathedral, Vor Frues Kirke (Our Lady's Church), consecrated in 1738, was destroyed by a fire that affected the whole city, on 18 December 1880. This cathedral has been reconstructed and rebuilt in size 1:10. The model is on display at the Vest- Agder Museum Kristiansand. It was built by a group of enthusiastic model builders. The current cathedral, which is larger than its predecessors, was consecrated in 1885. When the 1940 Nazi attack on Kristiansand took place early in the morning of 9 April 1940, the -tall cathedral tower was hit by an artillery shell, which damaged the upper part.

It was devised in 2003 in New York City by Robert Arnold, with an unnamed collaborator.The napkin with the first scribbled notes In July 2010 at the Deaf Nation World Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada, it was presented and formally announced to the public. Soon after its release, si5s development split into two branches: the \\"official\\" si5s track monitored by Arnold and a new set of partners at ASLized, and the \\"open source\\" ASLwrite. In 2015, Arnold had a falling out with his ASLized partners,https://www.justanswer.com/computer/98hds-email-accounts-profit- organization-created.html took down the si5s.org website, and made his Twitter account private. ASLized has since removed any mention of si5s from their website. Arnold completed his Masters thesis, \\"A Proposal Of the Written System For ASL,\\" at Gallaudet University in 2007, looking at the need for a written form for ASL, and proposing the use of si5s. si5s stresses that the \\"written system is not to offer readers and scholars how sign language functions but how signers think and communicate in sign language.\\" Its objective is to provide transparency between ASL, as a written language, and other written languages, to allow for a literary study of sign language without glossing. Arnold is currently a faculty member of the Sign Language & Interpreting program at Mt. San Antonio College. Comparison of some ASL writing systems. SignWriting is at the far left, si5s to the right of it. Components si5s and ASLWrite are built from five primary components: the digibet, diacritics, movement marks, locatives and extramanual marks. Not every component is needed for every word, but ASL employs each consistently. At its core, any word written is built from the digibet bank and additional features are added. Words such as \\"I-LOVE-YOU\\" do not necessarily need anything more than its handshape, whereas others can employ each or nearly every component. Some words are in fact logographs such as \\"WHO\\" and \\"FOR- FOR.\\" To build a word, handshapes are bounded to locatives with diacritics and movement marks bounded to the handshape graphemes themselves. Extramanual marks are inserted above to the left or right of the word. As such, there is no set positioning or graphic orientation of the handshape or movement marks. Digibet The core of the writing system, the digibet, represents many handshapes of ASL. They are conditioned by left-/right-handedness, orientation and relative location. There are 67 handshapes within the digibet as of yet. Diacritics Diacritics mark movement of the hand itself such as a flutter in \\"FLIRT\\" or hinge in \\"YES\\" or \\"CAN.\\" The diacritics are: Hinge, Rotational, Rattle, Flutter, and Edge. Movement marks Movement marks indicate the movement of the word itself. Some movement marks are systematic, such as move outward, others are less so, such as \\"WALK-DRUNKENLY.\\" Locatives Locatives indicate when a word is bounded to the body (rather than produced in the signing space). They are subcategorised into two fields: frontal and profile. * Frontal: The frontal locatives are: forehead, chin, neck, shoulders, forearm and waist. * Profile: The profile locatives are: forehead, back of head, full face, nose, chin, torso and knee. Extramanual marks Extramanual features include facial configurations and body movements. si5s/ASLwrite extramanual marks are subcategorised into four: eyebrow marks, questioning marks, mouth morphemes and body movements. The eyebrow marks are: raise, knit, wan, slanted and squint; questioning marks: who, what, where, when, which, why, how and for-for; mouth morphemes: smile, frown, flat lips, pressed lips, tongue out, pursed lips, lips out, open mouth, barred teeth, cha, round mouth, puffed cheeks, puffed and round and pulled to the side; body movement: head nod, shoulder shift and nose crinkle. In total, there are 30 extramanual marks. See also *Stokoe notation *ASL-phabet *Hamburg Notation System (HamNoSys) *SignWriting Bibliography * ASL Writing - Blog.

First published by William Lyon Mackenzie on May 18, 1824, the journal frequently attacked the Upper Canada aristocracy known as the \\"Family Compact\\", which governed the province. Over its twelve years in publication, Mackenzie explicitly advocated constitutional change to resemble a more American government with the principles of responsible government, and working for the greater good of the people. The Colonial Advocate was used as a voice for constitutional reform, educating and inspiring citizens to take action against their government, making Mackenzie and his paper an important leader in the formation of the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837.  Origins of the Colonial Advocate  Coverpage of the Advocate published on September 27, 1824. The first edition of the Colonial Advocate was published on May 18, 1824 in Queenston, Canada. Within the year, Mackenzie relocated to York (what is now Toronto) and set up his offices there. The Colonial Advocate became the foundation for Mackenzie's political life. It would give people the information they needed to form opinions of their own. Mackenzie believed with relevant information and having opportunities for discussion, citizens would form conclusions of their own. He would blatantly state his views on members of government, using outward attacks including the names of specific people and established institutions. In a May 18, 1826 article, he attacked the Bank of Upper Canada as a \\"terrible engine in the hands of the provincial administration...entirely under the thumb of parson Strachan [an influential Anglican priest, mentor to many of the Colonial leaders and member of the Executive Council of Upper Canada] and his pupils.\\"MacKay, R. A. \\"The Political Ideas of William Lyon Mackenzie.\\" The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science 3.1 (1937): 1-22. Google Scholar. Web. October 11, 2011 He labelled the May 4, 1826 issue of the Colonial Advocate, the \\"latest and loudest blast of Colonial Advocate sounded in the ears of the people of Upper Canada,\\" writing, \\"during the whole of our brief editorial campaign we have exercised with boldness the valuable privilege of thinking for ourselves; it may be here remarked that this boldness does not always attend the public exhibition of our countrymen; who are justly formed over the whole world for the more valuable quality of discretion.\\" Attacks such as these made him disliked - even hated - among the wealthy merchant and professional class of Upper Canada. William Lyon Mackenzie He believed that the main revenue and profit from the newspaper would come from subscription, and mocked newspapers like the Hamilton Western Mercury which were profitable through government advertising. He claimed these papers were \\"openly in the pay of those who have sought for thirty years to keep the people in ignorance, squander the fruits of their industry ‚Ä¶ who had dared to stand up for the British constitution and the good of the country.\\"Kilbourn, William. Firebrand: William Lyon Mackenzie & the Rebellion in Upper Canada. Toronto, Ont.: Dundurn, 2008. Print. He called the publishers \\"sycophants\\" and resentfully said of them, \\"these man fellows will bow and scrape, and fetch and carry.\\" He was not afraid to make enemies, he wanted to provide the public with enough information so they could form their own opinions. For this he would hide nothing, not accept briberies, and publish his newspaper to expose any hidden interest by Upper Canada's elite. In the first edition, he stated \\"far be it from us to desire to bring into disrepute the government of this country, yet we will not fail to point out their errors. Ridicule shall not be spared: It may effect our purpose when grave argument would fail. We will carefully go over the principal matters connected with his [Lieutnenant Governor Sir Peregrine Matiland's] administration‚Ä¶ for the present we cannot remember anything he has done of a public nature worth recording.\\" The Colonial Advocate as a political voice  The reform movement began to gain strength in the early 1830s. After Mackenzie had received a large settlement from the Types Riot (see below), and had described the members of the Family Compact as driven solely by self- interest, the paper began to take a leading role in the Upper Canada Rebellion. As stated before, public availability of information was important to Mackenzie throughout his entire political life. In the first issue of the Colonial Advocate, he stated its purpose: \\"We have made our election; it is to have only one patron, and that patron is the People -- the people of the British Colonies\\". On September 22, 1831, he defined the purpose of publication as \\"to do the people's business and check and expose speculation and official knavery\\". Mackenzie's editorials spoke out on whatever he was feeling. The Colonial Advocate was widely read, and it was said \\"to read the Advocate would to be sure of finding remarks that had been better left unsaid.\\" Mackenzie was daring, he was forward, and unafraid to speak his mind. While the Colonial Advocate did publish more than politics, Mackenzie's interests shone through. He was \\"obsessed with the need for honest and efficient government, and for government that would respond immediately to the criticism and the wishes and the welfare of the people.\\" Through the Colonial Advocate, Mackenzie and other early newspapers made democracy possible \\"at the level where it matters most -- the exchange of ideas in the neighborhood, the serious but not necessarily solemn conversation among friends\\" For this, he would criticize the Family Compact, bringing to attention the imbalance of power the group held. From the beginning of its publication, the paper showed Mackenzie as a business man interested in practical improvements for the colony. It encouraged citizens to press for a representative form of government, and within his first year of publication began advocating for confederation of the British North American Colonies. He mocked the current government claiming that it had no respect for the person, and did not represent the interests of the average citizen and over well being of society but the interests of the upper class men.Wilson, W. R. \\"William Lyon Mackenzie Part 2.\\" Historical Narratives of Early Canada. 2010. Web. October 11, 2011. The economy of Upper Canada in the early 1820s was not prosperous for Canadians. For merchants, business was slow, little money was being invested, and when compared to the United States, the situation appeared much worse Kilbourn, William. Firebrand: William Lyon Mackenzie & the Rebellion in Upper Canada. Toronto, Ont.: Dundurn, 2008. Print Mackenzie believed that the Americans were developing because of the willingness of the government and private executives to spend money. Unlike in the US, wealthy British statesmen were not willing to invest in the economy, and at the time, investors were needed to jump start Canadian development. He especially admired the democratic system of the American government. As the reform movement accelerated in the 1830s, more Americans were immigrating north and were influencing this revolution. On May 18, 1826, he published an article praising the US in which he claims any political liberalism that has come to the province was, \\"owing chiefly to our neighborhood to the United States, and the independent principles brought into the colony with them by the settlers from thence‚Ä¶\\" MacKay, R.

University of Toronto Press. Web. October 11, 2011. He criticized the powers of the appointed justices, the granting of corporate privileges ultimately leading to the bitter relationship between Mackenzie and the group of officials named \\"The Family Compact.\\" At the beginning of his political career, Mackenzie called himself a \\"whig of 88\\" which represented the particular British constitutional idea of government known as Whiggery‚Äîwhich is largely what we have in Canada today. It is the idea that responsible government is an essential part of a constitutional monarchy. However his political views begin to change and began to admire the American political regime. In the first edition of the Colonial Advocate, he writes, \\"we would never wish to see British America an appendage of the American presidency; yet we would wish to see British American thrive and prosper as well does that presidency.\\" Rasporich, Anthony W.

Having lived there for a few years, Mackenzie got to experience first hand this sort of democracy.Lindsey, Charles. William Lyon Mackenzie. 2004. Google Books. On January 3, 1828, he published article titled \\"We The People\\" further discussing constitutional reform, \\"\\"the constitution of a country is not the act of its government, nor of any distant authority, but of the people constituting a government suited to their necessities -- a constitution contains the principles on which the government shall be established\\" Rasporich, Anthony W.

Print once again displaying his desire to have a government that supports the people. Public education As society was developing, there became a higher demand for education. Based on the principles of responsible government, education was a struggle.Mackenzie, William Lyon. 1837: Revolution in the Canadas. Ed. Greg Keilty. Toronto: NC, 1974. Print. This was for two main reasons. First, one of the main arguments arguing against responsible government was that there were not enough educated people who should be a part of government. On September 22, 1831, the Colonial Advocate published, \\"we have been informed that in the most populous country township in the home district there is not at this time of the year more than one school of ten scholars, altho' the number of persons between 6 and 16 is over 600!!!\\" Mackenzie then highlighted how this was part of the Family Compact's plan to stay in control, \\"this is the best practical commentary upon Dr. Strachan's system of education for keeping the great mass of people in ignorance and educating and instructing a few sons of pensioners and placement to hold them in the chains of mental bondage.\\" Second, keeping education under the rule of the Church of England sustained English rule in Canada. Strachan obtained permission from the Colonial Office to create a university, he saw it is as a place to \\"groom the ruling elite\\". However Mackenzie immediately sent a letter to the Governor General of Canada at the time, Lord Dalhousie, to get it revoked. He believed that education should be open to everyone, and as described in his is political pamphlet, \\"Catechisms of Education,\\" he claimed \\"political education consists in a right understanding of the science of government‚Ä¶ an agent employed in the forming the character of man...the strength of the whole depends on it\\". Mackenzie ensued the Colonial Advocate once again to attack Strachan and the Family Compact's ideals, and voiced these opinions through his papers and other publications. Listing of the Family Compact members in the government and their relations, by William Lyon Mackenzie, Sept. 19, 1833 in the Colonial Advocate  The Family Compact  On September 16, 1830, the Colonial Advocate wrote, \\"there is a natural aristocracy among men, founded on virtue and talents; and there is artificial aristocracy, founded on wealth and birth, without either virtue or talent\\". His disrespect for this aristocracy of which he speaks was never hidden. The family compact is a slanderous or disparaging name given to a group of aristocratic officials in Upper Canada during the 1820s to 1830s. It emerged after the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, immigrated to Canada and attempted to create an aristocracy by appointing his Loyalist friends to government posts and giving them land. The compact was coined with the term 'family' as the members were all linked by family, patronage, and shared political and social beliefs all to favor the mercantile upper class. They were members of executive and legislative councils, held senior bureaucratic positions, and were part of the judiciary of Upper Canada. It held conservative views, opposing Mackenzie and the Colonial Advocate. The Family Compact idealized British institutions such as a balanced constitution (powers divided between the Crown and executive and the elected assembly), a hierarchal society, and an established church. As the reform movement began to develop in the 1830s, the group began to see these reformers, influenced by the Colonial Advocate, as a threat to their power. The family compact held a great deal of influence and power in Upper Canada. At this time, the Canadian government was split into three parts, each of which the Family Compact members were a part of and held high positions. First was the legislative assembly, an elected body with a broad franchise that included essentially all men who owned property. Second, there was the legislative council, an appointed body that was similar to a house of lords. Members were appointed by the Lieutenant Governor Council, and were not directly responsible to the assembly (the decisions of the assembly on the other hand, needed ratification to become effective) and had the power to 'veto' anything they disapproved. This was a key feature in the imbalance of power of the legislative council; members used this power frequently, diminishing power of the elected assembly. Third was the Executive Council. Members were appointed by and were responsible to the Lieutenant Governor during their term, and the Governor and his advisors were in control of all decisions. The executive council is different from the modern cabinet in that its members were individually responsible to the governor general, rather than collectively responsible to the representatives of the people. They did not represent the majority of the population, nor did they need a majority support for their decisions, and they were almost never asked to resign. At this time, the legislative assembly was the most democratic (in the sense that members were elected) but with the power of the Councils to 'veto' anything they did not approve of, it also made the assembly the least powerful. This meant that the departments of civil service, not headed by members of council, were overlooked by the government. This was a complaint from Mackenzie as well as other members of legislature; that the civil society was underrepresented and the Family Compact had an unfair amount of power in legislature. The solution to this problem was the concept of responsible government, which eventually became the principle of the Canadian governing system. Mackenzie believed that this imbalance of power was further tainted by the Family Compact who held the key positions in government. According to Mackenzie, the Family Compact was \\"in control of decision making\\" in Upper Canada. John Strachan was a very influential member of the Family Compact. He was the leading voice of the Anglican Church and was a member of both the legislative and executive council. In the edition of November 3, 1831 of the Colonial Advocate, Mackenzie called Strachan and the rest of the Family Compact members, \\"profiteering through government office\\" and a \\"vindictive family function.\\" He stated, \\"the family connection [another name for Family Compact] rules Upper Canada, a dozen of nobodies and a few placement, pensioners and individuals of well known narrow and bigoted principles; the whole of the revenues of Upper Canada are in reality of their mercy; they are paymasters, receivers, auditors, kings, lords, and commons.\\" Mackenzie believed that even worse than patronage, the Family Compact enlisted themselves a sense of entitlement and aristocracy that made them believe they had the best decision- making abilities for the 'ordinary' people of Upper Canada. Mackenzie did not hesitate to express his views in his paper, a paper which reached a wide audience. In 1833, Mackenzie published the names of all thirty members of the Family Compact. In this publication, he included their names, the family linkages, the government positions, and their annual income. These members held the highest positions of Upper Canada; they were judges, sheriffs, and postmasters. The report listed members straight and to the point: \\"1. D'Arcy Boulton, Senior, a retired pensioner, ¬£500, Sterling .\\" Mackenzie wrote of the Family Compact: \\"the 'thirty tyrants' proceed in their systematic efforts to destroy good legislative measures; ‚Ä¶ besides the salaries of its officers fixed by law and the places and pensions and salaries and other things, your property, which its members unjustly enjoy, the legislative council demanded out the public chest last winker, for silk curtains, velvet for their throne...three out of every for of your salient representatives sanctioning the act of plunder, of robbery I might say, but I like to use mild expressions\\". Mackenzie spoke to the readers, directly addressing them to build his relationship with the readers.  The Types Riot  On June 8, 1826, a group of young men were seen breaking into the Colonial Advocate's office late at night while Mackenzie was out of town on business. Most of these men were law students, lawyers, and respected businessmen. The men terrorized Mackenzie's wife and son, and the employees; they wrecked the press and threw his type in the nearby bay.Wilton, Carol. \\"Lawless Law.\\" Law and History Review 13.1 (1995): 111-36. JSTOR. Web. October 11, 2011. Outside the building stood more than one magistrate witnessing the attacks without interfering. Attorney general John Beverly Robinson neither disciplined the lawyers or law students nor prosecuted them in any court. Nor did he attempt to make them pay compensation for any damages done to the Colonial Advocate's office. Mackenzie used this ruling to further display the unfair advantage the Family Compact has over the government, and encouraged Mackenzie to continue his attacks on the group. This incident became one of the many grievances that led to rebellion. Response to Types Riot Although more of an attack than a \\"riot,\\" the damages were plentiful. There were many witnesses, yet the eight men prosecuted went without criminal charges. This was believed to be due to their socioeconomic status. Mackenzie did not sit back and let this group of men go unpunished. He wrote a letter to the \\"Honourable Knights Citizens of Burgesses, representing the Commons of the United Kingdom and Britain and Ireland\\" describing the details of the riot, and the unfair results of the judiciary. After going back and suing the rioters, this time with more witnesses and with a legal team, he was able to succeed, earning Mackenzie enough money to repair the damage and more. This money re-established the Colonial Advocate. All this negative press was creating a bad image for the Family Compact members. Soon after, Samuel Jarvis, a member of the Family Compact and a convicted rioter, published \\"The Statement of Facts Relating to the Trespass on the Printing Press in the Possession of Mr. William Lyon Mackenzie\\" which addressed the public and particularly the subscribers of the Colonial Advocate. Afraid of the reputation he had gained from these riots, he felt it upon himself to try and excuse his actions. \\"I cannot, in justice to myself, or to those implicated through my indiscretion, remain longer silent, and quietly witness this second attempt at imposition, without an effort to counteract its wicked and mischievous tendency\\" and continues, \\"I had sufficient experience of the uncompromising baseness of Mr. Mackenzie's disposition, and could not doubt he would descend to the meanest and most contemptible artifices, and use the most strenuous exertions to paralyze the effect which a candid and indgenuous relation of facts was calculated to produce on the minds of a generous and impartial public.\\"Jarvis, Samuel Peters.

Members of the Family Compact feared its ability to influence readers and the general public, and for this they decided the need to attack it in attempts to scare it away. The end of the Colonial Advocate The Colonial Advocate began as Mackenzie's first political endeavor. It became a voice for him to display his own political agenda and thoughts, made him known throughout Upper Canada (although not necessarily well-liked among all groups), as well as allowed him to gain a support group for constitutional reform. The Colonial Advocate created new stream of thought for the citizens of Upper Canada, bringing to attention the government of the United States to highlight different ways of governance for the benefit of the people, as well as displaying the injustices and inequalities condoned by The Family Compact. The Colonial Advocate became a \\"vehicle for theoretical sovereignty\\" instigating resulting in activism in Upper Canada.

Despite its early multinational character the troop's original registration was with the London headquarters of The Boy Scouts Association as \\"British Scouts in Foreign Countries\\". This initial charter was due to there being no international Boy Scout office and the \\"nationality requirement\\" that was in effect at the time. In 1918 the troop's character changed considerably when the new Scoutmaster, Bro. Joseph Janning, received approval from Lord Baden-Powell to officially reorganized the troop as a mixed-nationality, or \\"international\\", troop. B-P subsequently brought the Troop's situation before the 3rd World Scout Conference where the newly formed Boy Scouts International Bureau (WOSM World Scout Bureau) received approval to directly register Troop 1 and, in the future, other such \\"international\\" groups. The troop was then directly registered by the Boy Scouts International Bureau and was issued the Boy Scout movement's first \\"mixed nationality\\" charter, dated October 30, 1925, signed by Baden-Powell as Chief Scout and Hubert S. Martin as Director of the new International Bureau. Within a few years the nationality requirement was abolished and, even though the Bureau maintained the direct registration of Troop 1 and other groups already registered, new groups were requested to join the national organization of the country in which they were located and no new groups were chartered. Over the years the directly chartered groups one-by-one and for varied reasons slowly disbanded and by 1955 only Troop 1 remained. The troop has been continuously active, including war years, since its first meeting held in Yokohama, Japan on October 16, 1911 and currently consists of coed sections of Beaver Scouts, Cub Scouts, Scouts, Senior Scouts, and Veteran Scouts. Background In Japan, as early as 1908, Scouting came to the notice of a number of influential educators, some of whom adapted Scout ideas to their educational work. However, the first Boy Scout Troop to be established in Japan was begun in Yokohama by Clarence Griffin in 1911.Boy Scout Kanagawa Renmei \\"50th Anniversary Publication,\\" Á•ûÂ•àÂ∑ùÈÄ£ÁõüÈÄ£ÂãïÂè≤ (Kanagawa Renmei Rendoushi), Boy Scouts Kanagawa Renmei, 2000, p.911 As an adult, Griffin was very active in the foreign community in Yokohama and decided to begin a Boy Scout troop in the fall of the 1911.

This is the troop that greeted Baden-Powell on his visit to Japan on April 2, 1912.The Japan Gazette, April 2, 1922, \\"A Distinguished Visitor to Japan\\", Yokohama, p.5 B-P had not heard of any Scouting in Japan prior to his arrivalYajima, Iwao, Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆ„Çπ„Ç´„Ç¶„ÉàÈÅ∫Áî£ÁôæÈÅ∏ (nihon no sukauto isen hyakusen), Vistaworld, 2010, pp.22 and expressed surprise at being welcomed by a local Scout Troop. Baden-Powell himself presented Griffin with a warrant as ScoutmasterThe Japan Times, Nov 17, 1962, Howard Van Zandt, \\"1st Boy Scout Troop Activities in Japan\\", Yokohama and the troop was subsequently registered with the Boy Scouts Association in London as the \\"First Yokohama\\", a \\"British troop abroad\\", and by that registration its membership was restricted to youngsters of British nationality. It does not seem that this limitation was strictly adhered to, but the troop generally marched behind the Union Jack and the Scout flag, and was frequently referred to as the \\"British Troop.\\" This troop, the First Yokohama, dropped its British charter in September 1918 and under the leadership of Bro. Joseph Janning, SM as the Scoutmaster changed its name to the International Boy Scouts, Troop 1. History Early years The transition by the Scouts of the First Yokohama to the \\"international\\" troop began with Marianist Bro. Joseph Janning's arrival on assignment to St. Joseph College. Bro. Janning had become acquainted with Scouting in the United States; and shortly after his arrival in Yokohama in December 1917, he became convinced that it would be an ideal addition to the program for all boys of St. Joseph College, regardless of nationality and not primarily limited to the British students of the school. In 1918, Bro. Janning proposed an \\"international\\" troop, open to all nationalities, to Bro. Jean-Baptist Gaschy, director of the college, and to the school council. After hearing his explanation of the Scout movement and his idea of an \\"international\\" troop, the council enthusiastically accepted Bro. Janning's proposal.International Boy Scouts, Troop 1, 50 Years of Scouting, IBS and St. Joseph College, Yokohama, September 1968, p.7 The first meeting of the new international group, consisting of the 36 boys of the 1st Yokohama and a few of their classmates, was held on September 16, 1918 on the grounds of the school. By the end of September there were over 70 Scouts and by the end of 1918 the troop had grown to more than 150 Scouts. In 1920, Richard Shin Suzuki, the son of a Japanese father and British mother, and a patrol leader in the International Troop, was returning to England for study when he was met on board ship by Toyomatsu Shimoda and Hiroshi Koshiba. Shimoda and Koshiba were traveling on private business to England, but were also to attend the 1st World Scout Jamboree. When they met Richard and learned that he was a Scout, they asked him to join them in attending the Jamboree. Being the only Scout- age participant, Richard carried the Japanese placard in the \\"Procession of the Nations\\" during the opening ceremonies. In January 1922, the troop was part of an honor guard welcoming Marshal Joseph Joffre to Japan. Later in 1922 they greeted Edward, Prince of Wales at the Port of Yokohama and took part in the Prince's dedication of a memorial arch to Allied soldiers fallen in World War I. The Great Kant≈ç earthquake of September 1, 1923, devastated Yokohama. Clarence Griffin was found barely breathing by shocked Scouts as they helped with rescue work in the aftermath of the destruction. Relocating to Kobe he recovered from his injuries; however, being financially ruined by the quake, he soon left Japan. At the same time, both St. Joseph College and the troop was temporarily relocated to Kobe where Scouting activities were continued without interruptionSJC Forward, St. Joseph International School, Dec. 1923, pp. 8 under the leadership of Bro. Janning. The college and the troop waited while Yokohama was being rebuilt after the devastation. The school, and with it, the Scout Troop returned to Yokohama in 1925. At the 3rd World Scout Conference in 1924, prompted by an earlier letter from Bro. Janning to B-P, the issue of the \\"International\\" troop was raised and the newly formed Boy Scouts International Bureau was authorized to directly register mixed nationality Scout groups. The IBS, Troop 1 Charter, dated October 30, 1925, was the first Charter issued by the International Bureau under the new authorization. Lord Baden-Powell and Hubert S. Martin, the first Director of the newly formed Boy Scouts International Bureau, signed the Charter. In 1929, Bro. Janning left Yokohama for the United States, and the troop leadership passed to Bro. William V. (Abromitis) Ambrose. With the gradual strengthening of the military and a more nationalistic sentiment in general, Scouting, and especially foreign Scouts, were increasingly viewed with suspicion by the Japanese authorities. The Troop was often followed by Japanese military police while on outings and the leaders decided it was inadvisable to openly wear uniforms or display flags or insignia. Outdoor hikes and camps continued but became limited in number. This situation caused a sharp decline in the enthusiasm for Scouting, and numbers in the troop declined.International Boy Scouts, Troop 1, 50 Years of Scouting, IBS and St. Joseph College, Yokohama, September 1968, p.8 Bro. Francis Tribull, a new arrival in Yokohama, joined the Troop in 1937 as both Cubmaster and Assistant Scoutmaster and the leaders decided to risk the re-establishment of the full Scout program, including a Drum and Bugle Corps. New flags were made and uniforms purchased. The renewed look rejuvenated the Troop. It grew to such an extent that it became necessary to establish \\"junior\\" and \\"senior\\" divisions. The group formed by the older Scouts, students from the high school section of the school, would eventually be called the IBS Senior Scout Unit 1. In 1939, Bro. Ambrose was named the director of St. Joseph College and, as such, Director of the IBS Committee, while Bro. Gerald Gutsmiedl took over the role as Scoutmaster. Bro. Tribull transferred to Kobe, and his place in Scouting at was taken by Bro. Brandmaier. Alfred X. Agajan, himself a Scout in the troop as a boy, became Assistant Scoutmaster. World War II and aftermath Such was the political situation that, on January 1, 1941, resulted in the Japanese Department of Education calling for the abolition of all Japanese youth organizations. On January 16, 1941, the Boy Scouts of Japan, which had been formed in 1922, ceased to exist.Hillcourt, William, November 1969 \\"Scouting in Japan\\", Boys' Life, Boy Scouts of America, p. 48 The international troop was not bound to discontinue its activities, but on December 8, 1941, Troop 1 Scoutmaster, Bro. Gutsmiedl, along with Assistant Scoutmaster Brandmaier and former Scoutmaster Ambrose, were the first arrested as enemy aliens and interned at the Negishi Internment Camp. On the same day, Bro. Tribull was also arrested in Kobe. This left Alfred Agajan alone with responsibility for the troop. In 1942, Bro. Leo Kraft joined Alfred Agajan in leading the troop. With the large number of foreign residents either voluntarily or forcibly leaving Yokohama, both the school and the troop, although continuing, suffered a loss of membership and many restrictions through World War II. With reduced numbers and the loss of jobs, funding was tight and, due to the war, outdoor activities were limited. In September 1943, the school was ordered to vacate its Yokohama buildings and was moved to very inadequate quarters in the Hakone mountains at Gora. The long abandoned property, next to a park near the station, consisted of old wooden buildings that had once served as a small hotel. The school was able to continue holding classes for a small number of students in all grades from 1 through 12. Bro. Kraft, Scoutmaster, went with the troop and school to Gora and Alfred Agajan was interned in Karuizawa. Indoor Scouting activities were continued by Bro. Kraft, practicing knot tying, first aid, and other Scouting skills while sitting on the stairways of the temporary school building. In 1945, when the war ended, Bro. Haegeli, Director of the school, negotiated the return of the school's property in Yokohama, and St. Joseph College was able to return to its pre-war campus in time to prepare for the start of the new school year. Alfred Agajan relocated to the United States and did not return to the troop. Bro. Francis Tribull, who had been an Assistant Scoutmaster before the war, was appointed Scoutmaster on his return to St. Joseph College, with Bro. Leo Kraft remaining as an Assistant Scoutmaster. The Troop joined with Japanese and American Scouts on September 24‚Äì25, 1949 in Tokyo for the first postwar All-Japan camp held by the Boy Scouts of Japan to celebrate the reorganization of the Japanese Scout association. The camporee was organized with the cooperation of the American occupation forces, who had formed their own Scout troops. It was held at Doolittle Field, now called Hibiya Koen, in Tokyo. The Boy Scouts of Japan were readmitted as a full member of the WOSM on June 30, 1950. In July the IBS joined the Kanagawa Scouts for a camporee to celebrate the Japanese Scout association's readmission to the world Scout organization. John Mittwer, a founding member of the IBS as a boy, and an active IBS Scouter, was also serving on both the Board of the Kanagawa Council of the Boy Scouts of Japan and as a District Commissioner for the Boy Scouts of America's Far East Council. Helping to revive postwar Scouting, he was a key organizer of the event that again brought groups from the IBS, the BSJ, and the BSA Far East Council together for an \\"international\\" camp held in Yokohama at Sankeien, the private garden of Mr. Hara. Soon after the Kanagawa Camp the IBS Scouts participated in the second All-Japan Camporee held from August 18‚Äì20, 1950 in Tokyo at Shinjuku Gyoen. The third All-Japan Camporee was held from August 4‚Äì6, 1951 and again the IBS and BSA joined the Japanese Scouts for the Camporee. In 1953, John Mittwer was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation by the National Office of the Boy Scouts of Japan.Ê®™Êµú„Åø„Å™„Å®Âú∞Âå∫ÂçîË≠∞‰ºö, November 1978 \\"„ÇÇ„ÅÜ„Å≤„Å®„Çä„ÅÆ„Çà„Åì„ÅØ„Åæ John Mittwer\\", Á¨¨ÔºîÂõû BPÈöõ, Boy Scouts Kanagawa Renmei, p. 9 The IBS participated in the first Nippon Jamboree (fourth All-Japan Camporee) held at Karuizawa in 1956. Beginning with this Camporee, the name of this national gathering of Scouts was changed to \\"Nippon Jamboree\\" and the BSJ announced that the event would be held regularly on a four-year basis, between the World Scout Jamborees. In the years since 1925 the World Scout Bureau had directly registered a number of \\"mixed nationality groups\\" throughout the world. The number of these groups, however, gradually decreased as troops disbanded for various reasons. Until 1955 there was also a directly registered \\"mixed nationality\\" Scout troop at the RAF Union School in Habbaniya, Iraq. The Troop was associated with the Union School which had a student body consisting primarily of Assyrian students, with an Armenian minority and a few Indian students. The school was under the authority of RAF Habbaniya and when RAF Habbaniya was turned over to the Iraqi government in 1955 the Troop was forced to disband.Mikhael K. Pius, HUSA Newsletter, \\"A Sketch of Habbaniya and Union School\\", HUSA, 2002, pp. 10 The Boy Scouts International Bureau (BSIB) had also dropped the \\"nationality\\" requirement and had stopped direct registration, instead referring new groups to a national organization such as the Scout Association or the Boy Scouts of America. This development left Troop 1 of Yokohama as the only remaining active troop of the original groups directly registered by the World Scout Bureau. Modern period IBS Emblems 1918, 1952, 1955 showing evolution of the IBS Emblem Prior to 1951 the IBS used an emblem of a simple fleur-de-lis with the letters I, B, and S at the points. In 1952 the emblem was redesigned with a globe at the center, originally showing the continents similar to the Boy Scouts of the United Nations emblem. After review of the new post-war constitution, badges, and program by the World Scout Bureau the globe was simplified to include only grid lines to create a more distinctive emblem. This emblem, shown on the IBS Scouter Badge, is still used by the IBS. The revised IBS Constitution went into effect after review and correction by the World Scout Bureau in 1956 and the first Scouts were awarded \\"Globe Scout\\", IBS's highest rank under the new constitution.I.B.S., Troop 1, Scout Handbook, International Boy Scouts, St. Joseph College, Yokohama 1961, p.19 Between 1956 and 1958, the IBS Committee and Leaders, under direction from the World Scout Bureau and with the cooperation of the Senior Scouts, prepared a new Scout Handbook, which includes the IBS Constitution, designs of the Scout uniforms, Troop 1's distinctive Scout badges and program. The IBS Scout Handbook was first published in book form in 1961; but the newly designed uniforms and badges were worn by the IBS contingent to the 1959 Nippon Jamboree. The 3rd and 4th Nippon Jamborees were held in 1962 and 1966 respectively, and the IBS continued its participation at the Jamborees with both Scouts and Scouters attending the events. In 1963, IBS Scouter Bro. Germain Vonderscher participated as a staff member at the 11th World Scout Jamboree in Greece, serving as a translator for visiting contingents. In 1966, IBS Scouter John Mittwer was awarded the Silver Cuckoo Distinguished Service Award by the Boy Scouts of Japan. Mittwer's work had taken him to Incheon, Korea where he was instrumental in helping revive post-war Scouting in the area. Following awards of Certificates of Commendation by the Korea Scout Association in 1962, 1963 and 1965 he was awarded the first of the Korea Scout Association's distinguished service awards, also called the Silver Cuckoo, in 1966. Mittwer participated as a staff member at the 12th World Scout Jamboree in 1967 in Idaho, U.S.A. and, at the conclusion of the Jamboree and in connection with the 21st World Scout Conference held in Seattle, Washington, he was presented a Scout Friendship Certificate by the WOSM in recognition of his contribution to international Scouting. He initiated an exchange program between the Incheon District of the Korea Scout Association and the Kanagawa Council of the Boy Scouts of Japan and, in 1970, was made an Honorary Citizen of Incheon in recognition of his contribution to Scouting in that area. On the occasion of the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the \\"International\\" Troop in 1968, the Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of Japan, Dr. Hidesaburo Kurushima, presented a Medal of Appreciation to IBS founder Bro. Joseph Janning for his role in Scouting.The Mainichi Daily, Nov 1, 1969, \\"Boy Scout Troop Founder Honored\\", Yokohama In connection with the 50th anniversary, the IBS also received greetings and a blessing from Pope Paul VI in the form of the Apostolic Benediction. 13th WSJ Jamboree Brochure produced by BSN with BSN & IBS Scouts The 13th World Scout Jamboree was scheduled to be hosted by the Boy Scouts of Japan in 1971 and preparations for the event were well under way by 1970. The IBS cooperated with the Japanese Scout association in the production of pre- Jamboree promotional items, including brochures, postcards and posters. The items featured IBS Scouts wearing the Scout uniforms of various countries to help promote the \\"international\\" image of the event under the theme \\"For Understanding\\". That 13th World Scout Jamboree was set to be held near Gotemba, Shizuoka Prefecture at Asagiri Kogen and, in preparation for that world event, the 5th Nippon Jamboree was held at this location in August 1970. A large contingent of IBS Scouts and Scouters participated in both Jamborees at Asagiri, as well as the subsequent 6th Nippon Jamboree of 1974 and the 7th Nippon Jamboree held in 1978. At the 6th Nippon Jamboree John Mittwer served as the overall head of the Jamboree's Postal Service Division. Being conveniently located in Japan, the IBS able to send a large contingent to the 1971 World Scout Jamboree under the leadership of Scoutmaster Joseph Schieble, Senior Scout Advisor James Masur and IBS Committee member John Mittwer. At the conclusion of the Jamboree Bro. James Masur, who had joined the IBS as a Scouter in 1952 and was a driving force behind the revised constitution and new look of the IBS, was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation by the Boy Scouts of Japan. From Dec 28, 1973 through Jan 4, 1974, IBS Scouts under the leadership of Scoutmaster James Masur traveled to the Philippines to participate in the 1st Asia-Pacific Jamboree. This Jamboree also celebrated the Golden Jubilee of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. In 1976 John Mittwer who, in 1972, had been awarded the Silver Hawk by the Korea Scout Association, was awarded the Japanese Scout association's second highest Distinguished Service Medal, also called the Silver Hawk. In 1977, in recognition of his outstanding service to Scouting he was decorated with the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Fifth Class by the Japanese Government. Bro. Joseph Scheible transferred to St. Joseph College on assignment in 1958 and, having experience as a Scouter in the United States, was soon signed on as Cubmaster of the Troop. Over the next 35 years he took responsibility for leadership positions in nearly every division of the IBS, serving as Scoutmaster for over 20 years. During the decades of the 1980s and 1990s the IBS continued its unbroken record of participation in the Nippon Jamborees. Between 1982 and 1998 IBS Scouts and Scouters participated in the 8th through the 12th Nippon Jamborees. This period also saw the participation of IBS Scouts at three World Scout Jamborees. In 1983 an IBS contingent under Scoutmaster Edward Bracha traveled to Calgary for the 15th World Scout Jamboree. The Troop's representation at the 15th WSJ in Australia, which was held over the 1987-88 New Year period was, due to the timing and distance, limited to a few Scouts who joined host Troops for the Jamboree. The 1991 Jamboree, however, provided a better opportunity for the IBS contingent and under the leadership of Scoutmaster Joseph Scheible a larger group of IBS Scouts were able to participate in the 17th World Scout Jamboree held in Korea. In 1995 it was announced that the Marianists planned to close St. Joseph College, now called St. Joseph International School, and in 1997 Bro. Joseph Scheible transferred back to the United States. Upon arriving at his new assignment he soon assumed the duties of Scoutmaster for a local Troop and continued in Scouting until his retirement in 2010, having been a Scouter for over 50 years. In May 2000 St. Joseph International School held commencement exercises for the final graduating class of the school. The school had been the home of the international Troop since 1918. Under direction of the IBS Committee, the IBS started the new decade by relocating to nearby facilities on the Bluff and in 2002 IBS Scouts and Scouters again marched in the opening ceremonies of the Nippon Jamboree. Through the decade, the IBS continued its unbroken participation in the Nippon Jamborees, taking part in the 13th through the 16th events which were held in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2013. In 2003 the IBS established an Amateur radio station, JQ1YRX, at the new IBS Headquarters and participated for the first time in the Jamboree on the Air (JOTA) from their own station. The IBS was also represented at the World Scout Jamborees held in 2007 and 2011. IBS Scouter Utz Reiff, himself a Globe Scout, Scouter, and IBS Executive Committee member, represented the IBS and participated on the staff at the 21st \\"Centennial\\" World Scout Jamboree of 2007. The 90th anniversary of the \\"international\\" Troop was celebrated in 2008 and in connection with the celebrations the IBS amateur radio station aired the commemorative callsign 8J1IBS, including an activation of the HF station by IBS Scouts from the summit of Mount Fuji in August 2008. In 2010 the APEC conference was held in Yokohama and from September 28 through October 3 the IBS participated, together with the Japanese Girl and Boy Scout associations, in exhibitions at the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse to commemorate the opening of the conference.Yokohama Keizai Shimbun, September 28, 2010, \\"Ëµ§„É¨„É≥„Ç¨„ÅßAPECÊ®™ÊµúÈñãÂÇ¨Ë®òÂøµ„Ç§„Éô„É≥„Éà\\" October 2011 marked the 100th Anniversary of the \\"British Troop\\", the \\"1st Yokohama\\", and April 2012 was the 100th Anniversary of B-P's visit to Japan and his surprise greeting by Scoutmaster Griffin and the Scouts from St. Joseph College that formed that original Troop. IBS Scouts and Scouters participated in the 23rd World Scout Jamboree hosted in 2015 by the Scout Association of Japan. Program sections The IBS program sections are: * Beaver Scouts, age 5 to 7 * Cub Scouts, age 8 to 10 * Boy Scouts, age 11 to 14 * Senior Scouts, age 14 to 20 * Veteran Scouts, age 18 up The first IBS Beaver Colony began as a boys only group in 2002. In 2008 IBS began a gradual transition to a coed program and both boys and girls were allowed as members of the Beaver section. The membership of remaining sections successively converted to coed membership between 2010 and 2014 with all sections currently being coed. There is some flexibility in age ranges based on the grade the Scout is in school. Nationalities of IBS Scouts and Scouters Since being chartered directly by the World Scout Bureau as a \\"mixed nationality\\", or \\"international\\", group the Scout members of the IBS have come from over 40 countries. The IBS lists Scouts of 43 nationalities, including those Scouts that were registered as Stateless due to their political status, as having been IBS Scouts over the years. Scouts of 10 nationalities have earned Globe Scout, the highest rank of the IBS, since it was established in 1957. The \\"international\\" nature of the IBS is not limited to the varied nationalities of the Scouts. The Scouters of IBS, with varied cultural backgrounds and Scouting experience brought from various countries around the world, also contributed to the uniqueness of the IBS. Although a comprehensive list of all adult leaders from over the years is not published by the IBS, Scouters that were Warranted directly by the World Scout Bureau as a Scoutmaster, Cubmaster, Senior Scout Advisor, or their main assistant, brought their Scouting experience and culture from 15 different countries. Amateur radio station The IBS operates a ham radio station, under the callsign JQ1YRX.

Early history  Founding member Mark Marczyk met bartender and musician Michael Louis Johnson in 2009 after returning to Toronto from Kyiv, Ukraine. Johnson then introduced Marczyk to the Gypsy-Punk band Worldly Savages. Marczyk joined them on fiddle. It was at afterparties for the Savages' shows that eventual members of the band, such as Tangi Ropars and Os Kar, joined in on late night jam sessions. Eventually, the concept for the band was solidified during a conversation between founding members Mark Marczyk and Tangi Ropars in a Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. Other members began to join the band over the next few years, usually after seeing the group live. Many of these meetings were by chance or accident. By 2013, the group had swelled to 17 members. The group were also involved in a collective known as Fedora Upside Down, a collection of bands, artists and theatre acts in the genres of singer-songwriters, improvised party brass, forr√≥, flamenco, Brazilian percussion, ragtime jazz and others founded by Marczyk, Tangi Ropars and Dre Flak of Freeman Dre and the Kitchen Party. Lia Grainger in 2012 described Fedora Upside Down as a \\"motley assortment of cultural ambassadors.\\" In 2011, the band recorded an EP titled Cheeky at CBC. The song Tomu Kosa was released as promotional single. In November 2011, the group performed at a TSoundcheck event held by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

While in Romania, the band opened for Taraf de Ha√Ødouks. On their way back to Canada, the band once again performed aboard a delayed Air Canada flight in Germany, and then in Toronto Pearson International Airport upon arrival. In 2012, Toronto filmmaker Justin Friesen made a short documentary on the band titled Let's Make Lemonade.

His son Franz Pech√°ƒçek became known as a virtuoso violinist and composer. The collections of the Municipal Museum in Usti nad Orlici contain two of his compositions, a piece for violin and orchestra entitled Rondeau brilliant and a concert duo for two violins, Polonaise. Early life Franti≈°ek Pech√°ƒçek was born in the back of a low category restaurant in √öst√≠ nad Orlic√≠ (Wildenschwert), later known as hotel Friml Orliƒçan (today a marketplace in the suburbs). He received his first grammar and music lessons in Usti, and then went to Litomy≈°l where he studied under the guidance of choir director and pianist P. Lambert. Later he went to study philosophy and also acquire further musical training as a violinist from Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf in Wei√üwasser, then part of Austrian Silesia. Musical career Pech√°ƒçek moved to Vienna when he was twenty years old, where in 1790 he began acting as conductor of the Landstra√üer Theaters and the Theater am K√§rntnertor. Pech√°ƒçek composed two large and ten small comic operas, twelve symphonies, thirty ballets, several masses and various piano and church music works, totaling over 100 opuses.

The main focus of his compositional activity consisted in the creation of dance music, such as laendler, waltzes, and minuets. In this field he gained such popularity, later only enjoyed by Joseph Lanner and Johann Strauss, of whom he is considered a forerunner.

Irving Limited. MNRY operates over tracks that were originally built for the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad but were most recently owned and operated by the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway . Approximately of MNRY's route is owned by the government of the state of Maine while the remaining is owned by MNRY outright, including the tracks in Canada. MNRY has two sister companies, the New Brunswick Southern Railway and Eastern Maine Railway which operate a continuous main line connecting Saint John, New Brunswick with Brownville Junction, Maine in addition to another of branch lines owned and operated by NBSR in Canada. History In early February 2010, the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway filed a \\"notice of intent\\" with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) that it intended to abandon of track in northern Maine, between Madawaska and Millinocket, part of the original Bangor & Aroostook Railroad's mainline, which had been bought by the MMA in 2003. Affected lines were located in Penobscot and Aroostook counties and included track serving Houlton, Presque Isle, Caribou and Fort Kent. MMA lines between Millinocket and Brownville Junction, Brownville Junction and St-Jean-sur- Richelieu, Brownville Junction and Searsport, and Madawaska to Van Buren were not included in this application. According to the MMA, losses from operating the lines between Millinocket and Madawaska had reached the point where they were threatening the financial health of the entire railroad. The STB subsequently postponed action on the request in late April, after the railroad and officials with the state of Maine agreed to negotiate to prevent the lines from being abandoned, which the state said could negatively affect the economy of the area. State legislators proposed that the state buy the lines and contract out freight rail service, similar to lines in Vermont and southern Maine. On October 20, 2010, the railroad reached an agreement to sell of track in the northern part of Maine to the state government for $20.1 million. The state would then contract operations on the lines to bidders when the deal was closed. The US government also issued $10.5 million in funds to upgrade and maintain the line. Part of this agreement saw the state of Maine being granted trackage rights over the MMA's remaining tracks between Brownville Junction, Maine and the state-owned tracks beginning near Millinocket, Maine which would be used by any successful contracting rail operator. On 17 December 2010, it was announced that the state was accepting bids for the operation of trackage the state was due to purchase, with the deadline for proposals being 19 January 2011. On 28 December 2010, the STB announced it had approved the abandonment of the tracks in question, allowing the state to purchase them. Here is actual lease between MDOT and Irving https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw0jCpuVRzgEODlEelFJWDRzdFE/edit?usp=sharing On 5 April 2011, it was announced that \\"Irving Transportation Services\\", a subsidiary of Canadian-based industrial conglomerate J.D. Irving Ltd. had been awarded the contract to operate the lines in question. \\"Irving Transportation Services\\" formed the MNRY on May 24, 2011 in Delaware and began operations June 15, 2011.Maine Dept of the Secretary of State, Bureau of Corporations, Elections and Commissions - Corporate Name Search In addition to interchanging with MMA at Millinocket, MNRY makes use of the state of Maine's trackage rights between Millinocket and Brownville Junction where it is able to connect with sister company Eastern Maine Railway and thus to Pan Am Railways at Mattawamkeag, Maine. In December 2011, the MMA and \\"Irving Transportation Services\\" reached an agreement for the MMA to sell the remaining of track between Madawaska, Maine and Van Buren, Maine, MMA's last track in northern Maine, thus ensuring continuous service by the MNRY from Millinocket to Van Buren. At Van Buren, the MNRY owns a railway bridge over the Saint John River that allows MRNY to interchange directly with Canadian National Railway in St. Leonard, New Brunswick. This bridge and associated interchange trackage in New Brunswick had long been a Bangor and Aroostook Railroad and later MMA subsidiary known as Van Buren Bridge Company. Route MNRY operates the following railway lines owned by the state of Maine: * A portion of the Madawaska Subdivision, consisting of approximately of line between milepost 109 near Millinocket, Maine in Penobscot County and milepost 260 near Madawaska, Maine in Aroostook County. * The Presque Isle Subdivision, consisting of approximately of line between milepost 0.0 near Squa Pan, Maine and milepost 25.3 near Presque Isle, Maine in Aroostook County. * The Fort Fairfield Subdivision, consisting of approximately of line between milepost 0.0 near Presque Isle, Maine and milepost 10.0 near Easton, Maine in Aroostook County. * The Limestone Subdivision, consisting of approximately of line between milepost 0.0 near Presque Isle, Maine and milepost 29.85 near Limestone, Maine in Aroostook County. * The Houlton Subdivision, consisting of approximately of line between milepost 0.0 near Oakfield, Maine and milepost 17.27 near Houlton, Maine in Aroostook County, including the B Spur. MRNY owns and operates the following railway lines: * The Van Buren Subdivision, consisting of approximately of line running between Madawaska, Maine and Van Buren, Maine in Aroostook County, including the Van Buren - St. Leonard Railway Bridge and associated trackage in St. Leonard, New Brunswick. Interchange points The MNRY interchanges at two locations: * In the north, it interchanges with CN at St. Leonard, New Brunswick using an unnamed railway bridge over the Saint John River from Van Buren, Maine. * In the south, it interchanges directly with Central Maine & Qu√©bec Railway at Millinocket, Maine and via trackage rights at Brownville Junction, Maine with CMQ and MNRY's sister company, the Eastern Maine Railway. * Also in the south, it interchanges indirectly with Pan Am Railways at Mattawamkeag, Maine via EMRY.

It combines the computational efficiency of the Binary Relevance method while still being able to take the label dependencies into account for classification.  Problem transformation  Several problem transformation methods exist. One of them is Binary Relevance method (BR). Given a set of labels \\\\mathit{L}\\\\, and a data set with instances of the form \\\\mathit{(x, Y)}\\\\, where \\\\mathit{x}\\\\, is a feature vector and Y \\\\subseteq L is a set of labels assigned to the instance. BR transforms the data set into \\\\left \\\\vert L \\\\right \\\\vert data sets and learns \\\\left \\\\vert L \\\\right \\\\vert binary classifiers H: X \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{l, eg l\\\\\\\\} for each label l \\\\in L. During this process the information about dependencies between labels is not preserved. This can lead to a situation where a set of labels is assigned to an instance although these labels never co-occur together in the data set. Thus, information about label co-occurrence can help to assign correct label combinations. Loss of this information can in some cases lead to decrease of the classification performance. Other approach, which takes into account label correlations is Label Powerset method (LP). Each different combination of labels in a data set is considered to be a single label. After transformation a single-label classifier H: X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{P}(L) is trained where \\\\mathcal{P}(L) is the power set of all labels in \\\\mathit{L}\\\\,. The main drawback of this approach is that the number of label combinations grows exponentionally with the number of labels. For example, a multi-label data set with 10 labels can have up to 2^{10} = 1024 label combinations. This increases the run-time of classification. Classifier Chains method is based on the BR method and it is efficient even on a big number of labels. Furthermore, it considers dependencies between labels.  Method description  For a given a set of labels \\\\mathit{L}\\\\, Classifier Chain model (CC) learns \\\\left \\\\vert L \\\\right \\\\vert classifiers as in Binary Relevance method. All classifiers are linked in a chain through feature space. Given a data set where i-th instance has the form \\\\mathit{(x_{i}, Y_{i})}\\\\, where \\\\mathit{Y_{i}}\\\\, is a subset of labels, \\\\mathit{x_{i}}\\\\, is a set of features. The data set is transformed in \\\\left \\\\vert L \\\\right \\\\vert data sets where instances of the j-th data set has the form ((x_{i}, l_{1}, ..., l_{j-1}), l_{j}), l_{j} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}. If the j-th label was assigned to the instance then \\\\mathit{l_{j}}\\\\, is 1, otherwise it is 0. Thus, classifiers build a chain where each of them learns binary classification of a single label. The features given to each classifier are extended with binary values that indicate which of previous labels were assigned to the instance. By classifying new instances the labels are again predicted by building a chain of classifiers. The classification begins with first classifier \\\\mathit{C_{1}}\\\\, and proceeds to the last one \\\\mathit{C_{L}}\\\\, by passing label information between classifiers through the feature space. Hence, the inter-label dependency is preserved. However, the result can vary for different order of chains. For example, if a label often co-occur with some other label only instances of one of the labels, which comes later in the label order, will have information about other one in its feature vector. In order to solve this problem and increase accuracy it is possible to use ensemble of classifiers. In Ensemble of Classifier Chains (ECC) several CC classifiers can be trained with random order of chains (i.e. random order of labels) on a random subset of data set. Labels of a new instance are predicted by each classifier separately. After that, the total number of predictions or \\"votes\\" is counted for each label. The label is accepted if it was predicted by a percentage of classifiers that is bigger than some threshold value.

Club career Early career Born in Macerata, Marche, Scuffia started his career at hometown club Maceratese. Scuffia made his senior debut in 2008‚Äì09 Serie D. Scuffia left the club in January 2009, 6 months before the club was expelled from the inter-regional league due to financial difficulties. Fiorentina In mid of 2008‚Äì09 season he was signed by Serie A club Fiorentina. He was immediately named in the squad for 2009 Torneo di Viareggio as the backup of Andrea Seculin. He wore no.31 shirt in the first team in 2009‚Äì10 season as the fourth keeper, behind S√©bastien Frey, Vlada Avramov and Seculin. However Scuffia was not eligible to 2009‚Äì10 UEFA Champions League List B (along with Marcos Miranda), and La Viola named Simone David as fourth keeper as David was eligible. Scuffia was in the pre-season camp of the first team in July 2009. Since April 2010 Miranda became the fourth keeper, and received numbers of call-up. In the reserve Seculin was the first choice, Scuffia played 7 times and Andrea Tozzo 5 times. With the signing of Artur Boruc in mid-2010 to replace the injured Frey, Scuffia's shirt number was stripped as well as Marcos Miranda became the fourth (the fifth if counting Frey). Scuffia also excluded from the first team squad for the pre-season camp in July 2010. Scuffia re-acquired a shirt number in October (No. 34). He also received first team call-up again since the injury of Avramov, ahead Miranda in early January 2011. However his fourth choice role was short-lived. On 10 January 2011 he left for Serie D (fifth tier at that time) club Rimini, few days after the signing of Neto. Melfi In July 2011 he joined Lega Pro Seconda Divisione club Melfi on a reported free transfer. Scuffia succeeded Andrea Pozzato as first choice. That season Melfi hired the entire squad with young players ranged from born 1989 to 1993. Catanzaro On 3 July 2013 Scuffia was signed by Catanzaro in a 2+1-year contract. On 22 January 2015 Scuffia and Gianluca Di Chiara were signed by fellow Lega Pro club U.S. Lecce in temporary deals, with an option to purchase. Ancona On 31 August 2016 Scuffia was signed by U.S. Ancona 1905 as a free agent. International career Scuffia received call-up from Marche regional Allievi representative team in December 2006.4\\\\. ATTIVITA‚Äô DI RAPPRESENTATIVA, He made his national team debut for the under-19 team against Romania in December 2008, the first match of U-19 born 1991 team. As a Serie D player, he replaced Simone Colombi at half-time. He played the next match in January 2009 against Denmark U18 for Italy U-18 team, de facto the same team with U-19 born 1991 team that season (second half of 2008‚Äì09 season). Both team were coached by Massimo Piscedda. However, since leaving for la Viola, Scuffia did not receive any call-up due to lack of play time. Scuffia received his first call-up in November 2008 from Antonio Rocca, for a goalkeeper training camp. He received a call-up from A.Rocca again in 2009.

The ad first appeared on Saturday September 24, 2011 and started to build controversy which reached a pinnacle on September 29, 2011. It was supported by the Canada Christian College, which houses ICV, and its President, Evangelical minister Charles McVety.National Post apologizes for running transphobic ad xtra.ca. September 29, 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-28. The advertisement spoke out against the teaching of certain sexual education topics in the Ontario school curriculum and discriminated against transsexual, transgender, and intersex persons. The National Post ran an apology for the ad on September 30, 2011 but revised it later on that same day when it alluded to sexuality as a choice, bringing further controversy onto itself. Two days after the Post‚Äôs apology, the Toronto Sun, another major newspaper, published an abridged version of the ad.Despite National Post apology, Toronto Sun runs transphobic ICV ad. Toronto.openfile.ca. October 03, 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-28. Though the Sun has since ceased running the ad, its refusal to apologize has courted further controversy. This series of events has sparked debates about serious issues concerning freedom of speech and freedom of religion, including the way these are negotiated within the public sphere. These events have also led to discussions about the role of newspapers within a society, especially regarding their duties to the public and the liberties they can reasonably take with their content and agendas. The National Post Initial advertisement The National Post, owned by Postmedia Network Inc., is a major newspaper in Canada and one of the core four papers serving the city of Toronto and therefore reaches a relatively broad audience. It aligns itself with the views of the Conservative Party of Canada.\\"World Newspapers and Magazines: Canada\\". Worldpress.org. 2007. Retrieved 2011-11-28 It is perhaps for that reason that an advertisement speaking out against teaching children about certain aspects of sexuality in school was overlooked by them and allowed to run. The ad first appeared on Saturday, September 24, 2011 and continued to run until September 30, 2011 and has been called anti- gay and transphobic. It was paid for by the Institute for Canadian Values, an organization branding itself as \\"a national think-tank dedicated to advancing knowledge of public policy issues from Judeo-Christian intellectual and moral perspectives\\". The full-page advertisement depicts a sad-looking little girl captioned with the words \\"I‚Äôm a girl.

October 05, 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-28. Retraction and apology On September 30, 2011 the National Post retracted the ICV advertisement and issued an apology for it, stating that the ad will not run in the paper again. The paper would not specify how the advertisement got past the censors but did say that procedures to qualify ads were not followed in this case. In the apology, the Post asserted its right to post such an ad, saying that it \\"believe[s] unpopular points of view should not be censored simply because some readers may find them disturbing, or even offensive\\". It also defended the contents of the ad itself, explaining that it was \\"attempting to make the case that the Ontario curriculum was teaching very young children about issues that, at that age, should be the domain of parents\\". The National Post does, however, agree that the advertisement \\"exceeded the bounds of civil discourse‚Ä¶ in its tone and manipulative use of a picture of a young girl\\". The paper also admits that allowing the ad to be published was a mistake on its part and it will be donating the money received from ICV to an LGBTQ-associated organization that has not been named. Revision of apology Very soon after the National Post issued the initial apology, it had to revise the wording after public backlash over the problematic message that it sent. The first version of the apology made allusion to ICV‚Äôs discrimination against \\"people who have made choices about their sexuality\\", further angering the LGTBQ community in Toronto. It is yet another example of a Christian group propagating the belief that sexual orientation is a choice, something which is considered very ignorant and offensive, and is never well-received by the LGBTQ community. The Post then replaced the offending phrase with objections to ICV‚Äôs \\"singling out groups of people with whose sexuality the group disagrees\\". Though both the ad and original wording of the apology are consistent with strict conservative values, the National Post‚Äôs retraction of the ad and re-wording of the apology seem to be attempts to balance their conservative agenda with a more tolerant public image. The paper is aware that the Institute for Canadian Values‚Äô stance is unpopular and therefore wants to distance themselves without taking a liberal approach, hence their defence of the ad‚Äôs intent but not the method ICV chose to communicate their point of view. The Post makes it clear they feel like ICV did not meet \\"a standard of tone and respect that is consistent with furthering constructive dialogue about important public policy issues\\". The Toronto Sun Despite the highly publicized debate and public backlash following the National Post‚Äôs decision to run ICV‚Äôs advertisement, Sun Media decided to run a slightly modified version of the ad on page 27 of the Toronto Sun‚Äôs October 2, 2011 edition despite awareness of the controversy that it had already caused.Toronto Sun will not apologize for transphobic ad. extra.ca.

Furthermore, the Sun has refused to apologize for running the advertisement though its publisher, Mike Power, did say that the Sun has chosen not to run the ad again. There are also reports that the Sun has referred to the decision to put the ad through a \\"principled defence of Charles McVety‚Äôs [and therefore ICV‚Äôs] freedom of speech\\".Hate Speech on Trial in Canada. dentedbluemercedes.wordpress.com. October 14, 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-28. Though the Sun‚Äôs actions are not illegal and its stance is in accord with the Post‚Äôs belief in the principles of free speech, the paper‚Äôs decision comes across as a deliberately provocative act. As of October 14, 2011 the ad was also on regular rotation on SunTV, another outlet of Sun Media. Backlash, controversy, and debate The LGBTQ community in Canada has long faced opposition and outward hatred from other communities, especially religious groups. Christian groups have been particularly vocal about their faith-based disapproval of what they perceive as lifestyle choices on the part of LGBTQ people. The late September and early October 2011 events concerning the National Post and the Toronto Sun are an example of the problematic dialogues which take place between these groups and can undermine one or both groups‚Äô constitutional freedoms. The LGBTQ community feels strongly that ICV‚Äôs ad is an offensive and deliberate attack towards transsexual and transgender people. Part of the backlash has been an open letter signed by many prominent LGBTQ associations in Canada such as the Lesbian Gay Bi Trans Youth Line, Rainbow Health Ontario, Ontario Aids Network, and Fife House. Combined, all of these events have sparked serious discussions, analyses, and debates about constitutional Canadian rights. Freedom of speech in Canada The main issue that has arisen from this early fall controversy is the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Canada‚Äôs constitution. Many have questioned, given these events, the extent to which Freedom of Speech should allow one group or individual to make controversial remarks to another. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees Canadians the fundamental freedoms of \\"freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication\\",Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. laws.justice.gc.ca. March 29, 1982. Retrieved 2011-11-28. covering both private and public expression. These delineations are very broad and therefore leave a lot of room for some to abuse this law. It is evident from public response and the Post‚Äôs decision to retract and apologize for running the ICV‚Äôs advertisement that they feel the contents of the ad is a form of hate speech. Canada‚Äôs definition of freedom of speech and expression being so broad, it is difficult to find legal justification for censoring ICV and McVety‚Äôs comments. They do not make any threats and none of the text is outwardly homophobic, though it is intolerant. However, the advertisement did not earn such heated responses simply because the opinions it expresses are unpopular; ICV is actively discriminating against LGBTQ ‚Äì and especially transgender and transsexual ‚Äì people and using a nationally distributed media platform. It is also part of a larger and more vicious attack which has been proceeding against this demographic. The ad seems to have encouraged both members of the public and Ontario PC‚Äôs to speak out in support of it and against the proposed Ontario school curriculum the ad targets, specifically with a misleading flyer. The flyer leads readers to believe that the new curriculum proposes activities like \\"cross-dressing for six-year-olds and‚Ä¶ a kissing booth\\" Hudak defends Ontario campaign flyer described as homophobic. theglobeandmail.com. October 03, 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-28. when the page cited in the flyer actually refers to a list of well-known gay persons and the kissing booth is a distortion of \\"an idea to give chocolates to students who complete a ‚Äòschool climate‚Äô survey\\". Though these individuals and groups are guaranteed the freedom of speech and expression, the statements made in these flyers about the curriculum are lies, as are the statements in ICV‚Äôs Post and Sun advertisement, that distort the purpose of the Ontario and Toronto District School Board‚Äôs sexual education curriculum. As The Varsity points out, the lessons contained in the curriculum seem to be about creating a safe environment for all children and are \\"clearly aimed at preventing bullying. [They] are not designed to convince a young girl to consider becoming a boy, or vice-versa\\".Transphobia in Toronto. Blatant transphobia appears in full- page ads in the National Post and Toronto Sun. thevarsity.ca. October 14, 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-28. There has been no formal ruling or consent on whether censoring the ICV would violate their freedom of speech and expression or whether it would be justified in order to protect the rights of LGBTQ people against being discriminated. It is evident, however, that the breadth of the definitions of freedoms outlined in Canada‚Äôs Charter of Rights and Freedoms has the potential to harm certain groups of people as such vague guidelines lead to the problematic actions and discourses demonstrated by the parties and events described above. Freedom of religion and its role Another pertinent issue raised by the aforementioned events is the freedom of religion allowed in Canada and the extent to which it protects such offensive statements. The Institute for Canadian Values has clearly defined itself as an organization with a Judeo-Christian set of values and a corresponding agenda. Their discrimination against the LGBTQ community is based on the religious beliefs outlined by their faith‚Äôs doctrine. Does religion justify discrimination? This ties in strongly into the question of religion‚Äôs role and place within the public sphere. Philosopher Jurgen Habermas sees freedom of religion as \\"the appropriate political answer to the challenges of religious pluralism\\".Habermas, Jurgen. \\"Religion in the Public Sphere.\\" European Journal of Philosophy 14.1 (2006): 1-25. Print. Pg 5 He also says, however, that \\"it is not enough to rely on the mere benevolence of a secularized authority that now tolerates minorities heretofore discriminated against\\"; freedom of religion has allowed diverse religious groups to practice and vocalize their beliefs without fear of discrimination, yet ICV seems to be taking advantage of that protection in order to discriminate against another group and interfere in political issues. Habermas emphasizes the importance of the separation between church and state and the importance of need for political institutions to \\"formulate and justify laws, court rulings, decrees and measures only in language which is equally accessible to all citizens\\". Though the ICV did not include overt religious language in their ad, their religious motivations are transparent in the target they have chosen and the mission statement on their website as are their attempts to influence politicians and political decisions, something which conflicts with the role that religion should have in a fair and equal public discourse. Though ICV as an organization and its individual members have freedom of religion, as well as freedom of speech and expression, their use of it, while still legal, openly discriminates against other people in a way which borderlines on basic human rights violation. Role of newspapers Freedom of speech and freedom of religion have been at the center of debates concerning the events of the scandal described in this article but it must be kept in mind that the forums for the scandal and subsequent discussion have been newspapers. The actions of the National Post and the Toronto Sun beg the question: what role do we, as a society, expect newspapers to fulfill, and how well are they fulfilling it? Newspapers are first and foremost sources of information; they must be aware of the events that are occurring in our immediate surroundings as well as in the rest of the world and filter that information in order to relay the most relevant information to the public. They have great power in their prerogative to choose what to relay and what to withhold; they can capture specific audiences with what they select to publish. Newspapers have evolved from merely being sources of information or even entertainment to being a reflection of their readers. The National Post, for example, has taken a conservative position; in a vicious cycle, conservative readers know that they can expect the Post‚Äôs point of view to match their own and the Post will continue to take a conservative stance to keep up with their readers‚Äô expectations. The ad sponsored by ICV was technically in keeping with their position ‚Äì strictly in terms of its political stance ‚Äì and is well within the Post‚Äôs freedom of expression rights. Their retraction seems therefore to be driven by something more than tolerance; the Post recognizes that their role as a newspaper, in addition to reporting news and catering to their audience‚Äôs political views, is to provide a platform for safe discussion and the advertisement violated that safety. We live in a time in which newspapers have shifted to the online world; the internet is part of the public sphere and has the power to foster discussion on any number of topics. The role of a newspaper on its website is therefore to encourage balanced and informed discussion and to let readers form their own opinions without overwhelming bias from third-party sources.

In 1950 he ran successfully on the Democratic Party ticket for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives, representing Union County. He served two sessions until 1952. He was elected again in 1956 and re-elected in 1960, serving until 1965. Other activities Roberts became president of the Imperial Ranch and Tung Corporation in 1952. He was appointed to Florida Forestry Board in 1952 by Governor Fuller Warren, serving until 1956, when he assumed the board presidency. He was also active in many community associations, including the Chamber of Commerce, Masons, Rotary Club, and American Turpentine Farmers Association Board. Personal He married Gertrude Ann Wynn in August 1928. They had two daughters and a son. After her death in 1961, he remarried to Marjorie Mizelle Lascola (d. 2010), who survived him. They had one son, named Avery. Roberts died at Gainesville, Florida in 1973 and was interred at Dekle Cemetery in Lake Butler alongside his first wife, Gertrude.

The Charter also permits the government to enforce \\"reasonable\\" limits. Hate speech, obscenity, and defamation are common categories of restricted speech in Canada. During the 1970 October Crisis, the War Measures Act was used to limit speech from the militant political opposition. Legislation Section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establishes the right to freedom of expression, and the Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted this right in a very broad fashion. However, section 1 of the Charter establishes that reasonable limits can be placed on the right if those limits are prescribed by law and can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. Reasonable limits Freedom of expression in Canada is not absolute; Section 1 of the Charter allows the government to pass laws that limit free expression so long as the limits are \\"reasonable and can be justified in a free and democratic society\\".\\"Freedom of Expression\\", Centre for Constitutional Studies, University of Alberta. Retrieved 14 May 2020. This can often be the subject of controversy as some feel the conditions for reasonable justification are vague, granting the government an unreasonable amount of control over freedom of expression. Others feel that such restrictions are necessary in order to balance the fundamental freedoms of one party against those of another, and to otherwise limit political violence and tyranny of the majority. Hate speech (which refers to the advocacy and incitement of genocide or violence against a particular defined racial, ethnic, gender, sexual, religious or other identifiable group), and obscenity (a broad term referring to literature that is unreasonable, dangerous or intensely inappropriate to society at large, such as child pornography or fraudulent medication intended to promote sexual virility), are two examples that gain significant attention from the media and in public discourse. Canadian libel and defamation law Libel involves publication in some permanent form such as writing in a book or newspaper.Flaherty, Gerald A. Defamation Law in Canada. Ottawa, Ont.: Canadian Bar Foundation, 1984. Defamation is a tort that gives a person the right to recover damages for injury due to publication of words that were intended to lower a person's character.Richard, John D., and Stuart M. Robertson. The Charter and the Media. Ottawa, Ontario: Canadian Bar Foundation, 1985. The law encourages the media to publish with caution, to avoid any forms of libel and to respect a person's freedom of expression. \\"Defamatory libel\\" is a criminal offence under the Criminal Code. Subsection 298(1) defines defamatory libel as \\"a matter published, without lawful justification or excuse, that is likely to injure the reputation of any person by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or that is designed to insult the person of or concerning whom it is published.\\" Section 300 prohibits the publication of defamatory libels that the publisher \\"knows is false.\\" Section 301 prohibits the publication of any defamatory libel, but this section has been found unconstitutional as it could criminalize the publication of matters that are true. For example, James Keegstra, an antisemite who taught Holocaust denial to schoolchildren in Alberta, was convicted and prosecuted for hate speech.MacKinnon, Catharine A. Only Words. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1993. Censorship of media In the 1970s, the Canadian national security apparatus abused its surveillance powers to illegally suppress left-leaning press outlets through arson, breaking and entering, and theft. Censorship redefines the idea of freedom of speech as a public right rather than a private one. Senator Keith Davey supported this view in 1981, writing in The Globe and Mail: \\"Too many publishers harbor the absurd notion that freedom of the press is something they own...of course the exact opposite is the case. Press freedom is the right of the people.\\"Senator D. Keith Davey, \\"How Misreading Jolted the Press\\", The Globe and Mail, September 16, 1981. The emergence of the internet as a major site of media distribution opened up a new avenue for state censorship; especially as Canadians are heavy users of the internet. In 2007, the Associate Deputy Minister of National Defence under Prime Minister Stephen Harper asserted in Parliament that the Canadian government was working with the American National Security Agency (NSA) and other such agencies to \\"master the internet\\". In such an effort, Canada's government has participated in the securitization of the internet. \\"Securitization\\" is a phenomenon wherein threats to state power are characterized as threats to \\"the people\\", legitimating otherwise impermissible acts in the name of protecting the security of the nation. Internet censorship may also be undertaken by the corporations that control access - Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In 2005, a major Canadian ISP, Telus, blocked access to a website set up to publicize the views of a labour union in conflict with the company. The Canadian Telecommunications Act prohibits carriers controlling the content they carry for the public; however Telus argued that it acted within the law, citing its contractual power to block certain sites. The block incidentally affected hundreds of unrelated websites and was removed after attracting public criticism. Compared to the United States, Canada's regulatory environment is markedly protective of net neutrality. This is credited to the country's regulatory structure, existing laws, bipartisan agreement on the issue, and the uncompetitive nature of the Canadian telecom market, which necessitates tight regulation to avoid abuses. Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec crisis After the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ) crisis, many attacks were made against the press, suggesting that the media were irresponsible in the way they elaborated rumours during a time of crisis.Cohen-Almagor, Raphael. The Scope of Tolerance : Studies on the Costs of Free Expression and Freedom of the Press. London: Routledge, 2006. Criticism reached highs to the point that after Pierre Laporte‚Äôs death on October 17, 1970, the Liberal Party whip, Louise-Philippe Lacroix accused the journalists of being responsible for the death. Secretary of State Pelletier and the Chairman of the Canadian Radio-Television Commission (CRTC) discussed ways of achieving restraint regulations but concluded it would lead to accusations of censorship. The War Measures Act was invoked and CBC news reports in Ottawa received instructions that they were to broadcast only stories that were attributed to an identifiable source, retrain comments from the opposition parties, and to not allow their names to be identified with political statements. It was decided that the Secretary of State should see that private and public sectors of the media were accepting the government decisions. Program Secretary to the Prime Minister, J. Davey, thought the government should concentrate on four areas‚Äîone being for the Strategic Operations Centre to continue monitoring the media from week to week.Minutes of the Cabinet Committee on Security and Intelligence (6 November 1970) (classified \\"Secret\\"). Associations and controls Communications control institutions are governmental agencies that regulate, may change the media, regulations, and new regulatory bodies. In 1982, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said: \\"When the media do not discipline themselves, the state steps in\\".Singer, Benjamin D. Communications in Canadian Society. Don Mills, Ontario: Addison-Wesley, 1983. There are some inter-media control institutions that regulate themselves to avoid being regulated by the government such as: The Canadian Association of Broadcasters, the Ontario Press Council, publishers associations, and advertising groups. National Media associations, many newspapers, magazines, and major retail chains have supported the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards. The Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunication Commission (CRTC), must approve all scripts for broadcasting advertisements of food, drugs, and cosmetic products over Canadian stations. In Ontario, the Liquor License Board, under the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations, publishes a book listing what can and cannot be published in print and what can be broadcast in advertising for wine, beer, and cider products. All commercials that are intended for children under 12 years of age must follow the Broadcast Code for Advertising to Children and is managed by the Children's Committee of the Advertising Standards Council. Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta regulate the use of the title \\"engineer\\" and impose penalties of up to $10,000 for a first offence and $25,000 thereafter on the use of the title or related language or seals by those not accredited by the relevant provincial engineering society, regardless of qualification.\\"Section 40.(1): Offence, practice of professional engineering\\", Professional Engineers Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter P.28., Ontario e-Laws. Retrieved 23 July 2014. Books What can and cannot be published in books raises questions of free speech and tolerance. In 1962, D.H Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover faced a court decision questioning if it should be banned. The case challenged the federal government's obscenity laws under the criminal code. The book frequently used the word ‚Äòfuck‚Äô and used detailed descriptions of adultery which insulted some readers.Warburton, Nigel. Free Speech: a Very Short Introduction. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009. The argument was made that the book was obscene, faced issues with obscenity and would corrupt and degrade readers. The rules on censorship by the federal government were not clear and in 1962, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the book could continue to be published and found Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover not obscene. Mark Steyn‚Äôs 2006 book about the Muslim Diaspora in the West, America Alone, was the subject of a complaint from Mohamed Elmasry, head of the Canadian Islamic Congress, stating that the article \\"discriminates against Muslims on the basis of their religion. It exposes Muslims to hatred and contempt due to their religion\\". The complaint against Steyn and Maclean's magazine, which excerpted the book when it was published in 2006, was heard before three human rights commissions: Ontario's, which declared it lacked jurisdiction;\\"Commission statement concerning issues raised by complaints against Maclean's Magazine, Ontario Human rights Commission, 9 April 2008. British Columbia's, which dismissed the complaint;Macdonald, Neil. \\"Free Speech, Eh? Why Is Canada Prosecuting Mark Steyn?\\".

Television By the early 1990s, Canada was the second largest exporter of audiovisual products after the United States. The Canadian Statute of 1968 added to the obligations of broadcasters that Canadian broadcasting should promote national unity, and that broadcasters must obey the laws respecting libel, obscenity, etc. Some suggest that Canada is advanced of multiculturalism but some challenge this with issues of ethnic and religious minorities. In 2004, broadcast carriers were to monitor foreign stations at all times and delete any content that may go against the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Restrictions were placed on the broadcasting license for Al-Jazeera, an Arabic-language news network, by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).Beaty, Bart, Derek Briton, Gloria Filax, and Rebecca Sullivan, eds. How Canadians Communicate III: Contexts of Canadian Popular Culture. Edmonton: AU, 2010. On January 11, 1982, the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) began airing television programs across the Northwest Territories and Northern Quebec. For almost a decade, Inuit communities received mostly English-language programming which raised a concern because many people in the North did not understand English. Therefore, Inuit did not share the same cultural orientation and could not identify freely with their traditions or of southern Canada. Inuit Tapirisat began a three-year Anik B Project name Inukshuk. The Inukshuk Project linked six communities in three Arctic regions by satellite through one-way video and two-way audio. Inukshuk aired teleconferencing, live and pre-taped programs and initiated the concept of an Inuktitut television network. The Inuit Broadcasting Corporation assures more Inuktitut programming on television and Inuit have increasing access to information. Inuit today are familiar with the role of communications on history and the process of contemporary development‚Äîcultural stability was strengthened because new electronic media allowed Inuit adaptation of their own institutions and participation was brought to the North. Internet The Internet has become the gates of communication whether it is through interacting with each other or providing a wide selection of information to the public. Free speech and the use of the Internet ties with the capability of governments restricting free expression and the use of the Internet. Although the Internet seems an innovative and sure form of media, it is potentially associated with irresponsible speech and dangers with it. A 2008 study by the National Research Council of Canada broadly elaborated on user-generated video and the prevalence of the internet as potentially meaningful for civil society and the development of free expression through digital means in Atlantic Canada. Richard Posner, an American jurist and legal theorist, identifies four means of publication: # Anonymity: The Internet permits users and creators of communications to remain hidden. This makes it far easier to produce, create and consume false, illegal, and dangerous material such as child pornography or hate speech. # Lack of quality control: Almost anyone can post almost anything on the Internet. On the Internet unsubstantiated assertions are as easily published as well-researched articles. # Huge potential audience: The Internet provides access to millions of potential readers and viewers across the world. This can magnify any harm caused by speech. # Antisocial people find their soul mates: People with odd, eccentric, subversive, and dangerous views can find each other very easily on the Internet. Such people become emboldened not only to express their ideas, but also to act upon them, their self-confidence bolstered by membership in a community of believers. This can bring dangers of people such as pedophiles. The Internet has brought concerns about the limits of free speech that copyright law imposes. This can become a restriction on freedom of speech if a person wishes to use work without proper permission. Copyright protects the words and images used to portray the ideas but it does not protect the ideas themselves. When it comes to any restrictions on free speech there needs to be a valid justification for it, but the case of copyright seems to override the idea that it is against free speech‚Äîrather a solution to the protection of people's words and images. Internet providers have laws against hate messages and if sites violate these terms they become shut down. Bernard Klatt was the owner of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) named Fairview Technology Centre Ltd in Oliver, British Columbia. In 1998, Klatt was identified as a host of multiple websites associated with hate speech, neo-Nazi organizations, the Toronto-based Heritage Front, the World Wide Church of the Creator, and the French Charlemagne Hammerhead Skinheads. Local businesses, schools, students and government agencies had easy access to the racist sites because Fairview Technology was their service provider. The Hate Crimes Unit established by the government in British Columbia examined the complaints against Fairview, and required Fairview to accept full legal liability for the material on the sites; Klatt then sold the Internet service to another company. The case of R v Elliott is believed to be the first instance of a Canadian being prosecuted for speech via Twitter, an online digital forum, with potential implications for online freedom of speech in Canada. The Ontario Court of Justice later dismissed the charges due to a lack of evidence and criminal intent, finding that Gregory Alan Elliot engaged in limited legitimate and free debate, although potentially vulgar and obscene. In addition, it was asserted that those who create hashtags on Twitter, do not ultimately control the tweets utilizing said hashtags, and that the prosecution's claims partly rested on those impersonating Elliot. Elliot could not be found guilty for actions not committed by himself. Pornography Canadian pro-pornography feminist Wendy McElroy argues for the toleration of pornography. In her book, XXX: A Woman‚Äôs Right to Pornography (1995), she believes that women (and men) are free to make up their own minds about their use of pornography and should not be forbidden access to it. If this is true, then pornography should be of some importance since it allows its users to learn about themselves and is part of the principle of free speech. Some believe that the law should protect values and that anything that may corrupt or undermine these values should be banned by the law. However, those in favor of defending free speech believe that any restriction must strongly be based on more than just a reaction of disgust and hatred. The approach by the Supreme Court on free expression has been that in deciding whether a restriction on freedom of expression is justified, the harms done by the particular form of expression must be weighed against the harm that would be done by the restriction itself.Sumner, L. W. The Hateful and the Obscene: Studies in the Limits of Free Expression. Toronto: University of Toronto, 2004. This makes the justification of limits of free expression difficult to determine. Those who are against pornography argue that pornography is basically treated as defamation rather than as discrimination. As Catharine MacKinnon, a feminist and activist based in the United States, says: \\"It is conceived in terms of what it says, which is imagined more or less effective or harmful as someone then acts on it, rather than in terms of what it does. Fundamentally, in this view, a form of communication cannot, as such, do anything bad except offend\\". Pornography also raises issues concerning rape, violation of women and child pornography. Free speech in times of crisis Communication has an importance in times of crisis to warn communities of disasters and help follow the impact of it. The terms of Canada's renewed Official Secrets Act causes fears in Canadian media in which they may not be free to report on abuses in the national security sphere because they could be prosecuted. The Canadian attitude to criminalizing speech associated with terrorism has so far been somewhat careful. Canada amended its 2001 Anti- terrorism Bill to provide that \\"for a greater certainty, the expression of a political, religious, or ideological thought, belief or opinion\\"Criminal Code of Canada, s.83.01 (1.1). will not constitute a terrorist activity unless the expression satisfies the other definition of terrorist activities. Canada did increase the ability to seize and remove hate propaganda from the Internet and new penalties for damage to religious property in connection to terrorism and hate speech.Manson, Allan, and James Turk. Free Speech in Fearful Times: after 9/11 in Canada, the U.S., Australia & Europe. Toronto: Lorimer, 2007. Despite the War Measures Act, the federal cabinet has power to censor the media by declaring a war emergency or an international emergency. The Emergencies Act does require that the acknowledgment of an emergency be presented before Parliament within seven days where the Parliament can have a chance to revoke it. Julian Sher, president of the 1000-member Canadian Association of Journalists, predicted that the media would launch a court challenge if the Charter of Rights was violated. However, cases in the past have seen courts approving military censorship. For example, during the Canadian army's confrontation with Mohawk warriors at Oka, Quebec, there were restrictions on the media including the cutoff of cellular telephones. In 1970, during the October crisis in Quebec, the War Measures Act was imposed and the media were not allowed to publish the manifestos of the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec and even some journalists were jailed.\\"War and the media Cabinet can invoke full- scale censorship\\".

She married at the age of 13 or 14 in London, she was unhappily brought to the American colonies by her first husband, John Hicks, where they settled in Weymouth. The couple had two known children, and moved to the Rhode Island Colony, but she soon separated from her husband, and looking for maintenance, settled in Newport with George Gardiner, with whom she lived for about 20 years as his common-law wife. In 1658 she and a friend made a difficult journey to Massachusetts to present their Quaker message, and they were brought before the Governor, then whipped and imprisoned. A few years later, in 1665, Herodias left Gardiner, and went to live with prominent and wealthy John Porter in the Narragansett country west of the Narragansett Bay. She left behind many court records documenting her marital turmoils. She had nine known children with her first two husbands, and has many descendants.  Life   First marriage: John Hicks  William Coddington's 1644 account of the separation of Herodias from John Hicks Herodias Long was born in England about 1623, but her place of nativity is not known. She may be the Odias Longe who was left a legacy of five pounds in early 1639 by John Ayshford, who owned land in 'Little Ockenbury' and in the Barbadoes.Moriarty, 1945, p. 200, spellings corrected from cited source: Will of John Ayshford, 1639, The National Archives, PROB 11/179/449. According to her testimony in court many years later, she was sent to London following the death of her father, and here, unknown to her friends, she married John Hicks. She was 13 or 14 years old when they were married at Saint Faith's Church (\\"under Saint Paul's\\"), and their marriage licence was dated 14 March 1636/7. Shortly after their marriage, to her \\"great grief,\\" they immigrated to New England, and settled in Weymouth in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Here they lived until about 1640, when they moved to Aquidneck Island, probably settling in the town of Newport. They had two children together, but soon after moving to Rhode Island differences arose between them, and Herodias separated from Hicks, and consummated a relationship with George Gardiner, with whom she lived for the next 20 years as his common law wife. Hicks went off to live with the Dutch, and was in the process of obtaining a divorce from her in Rhode Island in December 1643, when he sent a letter from Flushing, New Netherland to Rhode Island magistrate John Coggeshall. Hicks also eventually obtained a divorce from her in New Netherland, charging her with adultery. It appears that Herodias had been in an abusive relationship, based on a 7 March 1644 court case where John Hicks of Newport was \\"bound to the Peace by the Governor [sic], Mr. Easton, in a bond, for beating his wife Harwood Hicks...\\" (Easton was actually an Assistant, not the Governor.) In her later testimony, Herodias states \\"...that the authority that was then under grace, saw cause to part us, and ordered that I should have the estate which was sent me by my mother, delivered to me by the said John Hickes; but I never had it, but the said John Hickes went away to the Dutch, and carried away with him the most of my estate; by which means I was put to great hardship and straight.\\" In his letter to Coggeshall, dated 12 December 1644, John Hicks wrote, \\"...the Knott of affection on her part have been untied long since, and her whoredome have freed my conscience on the other part, so I leave myself to yor advice if there may be such a way used for the finall parting for us.\\"  Second marriage: George Gardiner  Soon after her break with Hicks, Herodias lived with George Gardiner and spent the next 20 years with him raising a family of seven children, the oldest five of whom were boys, and the two youngest girls. During this time, Herodias became an avid Quaker convert, and she once again stepped into public view in May 1658. She, \\"with her babe at her breast\\" (her daughter Rebecca), and her friend Mary Stanton made a difficult journey through 60 miles of wilderness from Newport to her former hometown of Weymouth to deliver her religious testimony. For this, she was taken before Governor John Endecott in Boston, and she and her companion were sentenced to be whipped with ten lashes. Following the whipping, with a three fold knotted whip of cords, Herodias was jailed for 14 days. Herodias once again appeared in the public record in 1665 when she appeared in court, asking for a separation from Gardiner, relating that she had earlier \\"joined up with George Gardiner for her maintenance but was never properly married to him.\\" However, testimony of George Gardiner's friend, Robert Stanton, declared that one night at his house both George and Herodias did say before him and his wife that they took one another as man and wife. Herodias now desired of the Assembly that the estate and labor that Gardiner \\"had of mine, he may allow it me, and house upon my land I may enjoy without molestation, and that he may allow me my child to bring up, with maintenance for her, and that he be restrained from troubling me more.\\"  Third marriage: John Porter  1724 map of the 1657 Pettaquamscutt Purchase. John Porter gave much of his Pettaquamscutt land to the Gardiner children of Herodias. While the reasons that Herodias chose to leave Gardiner were not made apparent in her testimony, a major part of the reason was playing out in court across the Narragansett Bay. In May 1665, at the same time that George Gardiner appeared before the Assembly in Newport to answer the petition of Herodias, an \\"ancient woman\\" named Margaret Porter complained to the Assembly in Kings Town that her husband, John Porter, had left her, leaving her in such a necessitous state that she had become dependent on her children for her daily support, \\"to her very great grief of heart.\\" Porter was a very prominent and wealthy citizen of Portsmouth, who was one of the five original purchasers of Pettaquamscutt from the Indian sachems, a huge tract of land that would later become South Kingstown, Rhode Island. Porter's estate, both real and personal, was secured by the Assembly until he made adequate compensation to his wife, which he did the following month, apparently to her satisfaction, and he was thus released from the restraint. Soon, Herodias was living with Porter, initially under the pretense of being his house servant. In October 1667 an indictment was made \\"against Mr. John Porter of Narragansett in the King's Province and Harrud Long alias Gardiner for that they are suspected to cohabit and so to live in way of incontinency.\\" The following May, Porter appeared in court and was acquitted, and the next October Herodias was similarly charged, and acquitted as well. According to most writers on the subject, Porter eventually married Herodias, and she co- signed several deeds with him in 1671. In the early 1670s Porter made large conveyances of his Pettaquamscutt lands to the Gardiner children of Herodias, and also made a conveyance to Herodias' son Thomas Hicks of Flushing, New York. The death date for Herodias is not known. Miller and Stanton say that she survived John Porter, but Porter's death date is also unknown. He was still alive on 25 April 1674 when he was involved in a land deed, but was called deceased many years later, on 8 April 1692, when the children of Herodias appeared at a meeting of the Pettaquamscutt purchasers as \\"the assigns of John Porter, deceased.\\"  Family  Herodias had two known children with her first husband, John Hicks: Hannah and Thomas Hicks, and seven more children with her second husband, George Gardiner: Benoni, Henry, George, William, Nicholas, Dorcas and Rebecca Gardiner.

Nazism rejected the concept of the universal equality of individuals.Diemut Majer, Peter Thomas Hill, Edward Vance Humphrey. \\"Non-Germans\\" Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe, with Special Regard to Occupied. Washington, DC, USA: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2003. Only those who qualified as Aryans were allowed full legal rights, including equality before the law. This type of equality was not an equality of people as individuals but an equality of people as members of a master race, and thus individuals' interests were subordinate to the collective interest of the Volksgemeinschaft. The Nazis were opposed to the conventional universal conception of equality. They claimed to support V√∂lkisch equality, but at the same time Nazism was committed to intensifying human inequality as a whole to allow the German people to become the \\"new master class\\" of the world. People outside of German blood were automatically considered unequal and inferior and thus denied the rights of those of German blood. The Nazis advocated a welfare state for German citizens (able Germans of Aryan racial descent) as a means to provide social justice and eliminate social barriers between the German people.Gotz Aly, Jefferson Chase. Hitler's Beneficiaries: Plunder, Racial War, and the Nazi Welfare State. New York, New York, USA: Macmillan, 2008, p. 13. The Nazis provided equal access to education for talented children of workers and peasants.MacGregor Knox. Common destiny: dictatorship, foreign policy, and war in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 208. Hitler claimed that equality of opportunity for all racially sound German males was the meaning of the \\"socialism\\" of National Socialism. The Nazis sought to dismantle what they deemed to be an unnatural hierarchy of the middle class and nobility who had allegedly jealously kept their wealth and titles while failing to justify their hierarchical position through their actions in World War I. Even nationalists among them were deemed by the Nazis to have not upheld an appropriate share of contribution to the war effort. Thus the Nazis claimed that only the primordial brutality and willpower of the lower orders could save Germany, and thus justified equality of opportunity as a means to create new capable leaders for German society, and to build a new, \\"natural\\" hierarchy based on merit.

Overview  In the late 16th century, the Spanish developed a political system that depended heavily on the social status and prestige of the individual. Natives who were not nobility were expected to pay taxes, perform public labor, and personal service for the Spanish. Because of this pressure Incan natives began to manipulate both the legal system and their traditional mythology to prove their noble lineage. In 1569, Rodrigo Sutiq Callapi√±a successfully claimed his nobility by linking his bloodline to Manqo Qhapaq and Qoya Qori Kuka. Manqo Qhapaq was the mythic ancient Inka ancestor, known as the first Inka, and Qoya Qori Kuka was a great female warrior who defended Cuzco and was later imbued into a stone as a spiritual protector.Gary Urton, The History of a Myth: Pacariqtambo and the Origin of the Inkas. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 47.  The Callapi√±a Document  The main document used to assess Rodrigo Sutiq Callapi√±a is called the Callapi√±a Document, which he gave to the Spanish to prove his noble lineage. The document mostly details testimony that was given in Cuzco in 1569. The original Callapi√±a document was later used by Rodrigo‚Äôs two grandsons, who also petitioned for noble status and had a copy of their grandfather's investigation as the main evidence for their petition. Callapi√±a had a total of eight witnesses testify to affirm his lineage. The witnesses ranged from 85 to 132 years old, and were already recognized as descendants of the Inka nobility in Cuzco.Gary Urton, The History of a Myth: Pacariqtambo and the Origin of the Inkas. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 49. The Callapi√±a Document is a document that reveals the connections between elite families in Cuzco and the sixteenth-century ‚Äúreconstructions‚Äù of the mytho- historical tradition of the origin of Manqo Qhapaq. Rodrigo combined, in his ancestral claim (from his paternal ancestors), descent from both Tampu T‚Äôoqo and Sutiq T‚Äôoqo. Tampu T‚Äôoqo connected him to the Inka nobility in Cuzco, and Sutiq T‚Äôoqo linked him with an ayllu of the Maskas, a division of the Tambos ethnic group from the Pacarigtambo area.Gary Urton, The History of a Myth: Pacariqtambo and the Origin of the Inkas. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 51. When trying to deconstruct the methodology used to claim nobility, it seems that the Inka origin myth was being manipulated among high-class individuals in Cuzco wishing to exploit the benefits that came with being represented by the Spanish colonial administrative system.  Andean Peoples and the Spanish Administration  Rodrigo is an example of the way Andean people tactfully manipulated their traditional histories to take action through colonial procedures. By doing this, they were able to slightly shape the administrative system that was being forced upon them.Gary Urton, The History of a Myth: Pacariqtambo and the Origin of the Inkas. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 52. This example runs counter to the myth that Andean natives being colonized were simply overtaken by the system. Rodrigo Callapi√±a instead demonstrates that Andean natives sought to weave themselves into the fabric of the newly imposed administration by finding and exploiting loopholes, and also creatively manipulating their own histories to better their own social standing.

Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/10765 (accessed 24 December 2011). was a French composer and trouv√®re poet of the 13th century. Grove states that while details of his life are lacking, some documents of the time mention a Gautier d'Espinal active between 1232 and 1272, but it is uncertain if this is the trouv√®re, as some of the songs attributed to him suggest an earlier date. Most likely Gautier was one of the seigneurs of the city of Epinal. However, Robert Lug's more recent (2007) study of the Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s chansonnier (Trouv√®re MS U) shows that Gautier is not the person in the mentions cited by Grove, but was in fact a cleric, a nephew of the bishop of Metz. As Gautier's songs are contained in the oldest part of Trouv√®re MS U, they must have been composed before 1231‚Äì32.The reference to Lug's Der Chansonnier de Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s.

However, it cannot be verified; Lug's own website notes this work as still in preparation; see publication list here His work was popular and widely distributed, with some of his compositions appearing in over a dozen separate source documents. Grove lists fourteen songs with reliable attribution to Gautier, eleven of them with extant melodies. The list below relies instead on Spanke's revision of Raynaud's catalogue, and gives greater detail than Grove.

The procedure was most commonly carried out by inserting/rubbing powdered smallpox scabs or fluid from pustules into superficial scratches made in the skin. The patient would develop pustules identical to those caused by naturally occurring smallpox, usually producing a less severe disease than naturally acquired smallpox. Eventually, after about two to four weeks, these symptoms would subside, indicating successful recovery and immunity. The method was first used in China, India and the Middle East before it was introduced into England and North America in the 1720s in the face of some opposition. The method is no longer used today. It was replaced by smallpox vaccine, a safer alternative. This in turn led to the development of the many vaccines now available against other diseases. Terminology The terminology used to describe the prevention of smallpox can cause confusion. In 18th- century medical terminology, inoculation refers to smallpox inoculation. Confusion is caused by writers who interchange variolation and vaccination through either mistranslation or misinterpretation. The term variolation refers solely to inoculation with smallpox virus and is not interchangeable with vaccination. The latter term was first used in 1800 soon after Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine derived from cowpox, an animal disease distinct from smallpox. The term variolation was then used from the 19th century to avoid confusion with vaccination. Most modern writers tend to refer to smallpox inoculation as variolation throughout without regard for chronology, as is used here. Further confusion was caused when, in 1891, Louis Pasteur honoured Jenner by widening the terms vaccine/vaccination to refer to the artificial induction of immunity against any infectious disease. Inoculation is used synonymously with injection in connection with the use of vaccines or other biopharmaceuticals, but has other meanings in e.g. laboratory work. Origins China The Chinese practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, dating back to the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of \\"nasal insufflation\\" administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China. According to such documentation, mild smallpox cases were selected as donors in order to prevent serious attack. The technique used scabs that had been left to dry out for some time. Fresh scabs were more likely to lead to a full-blown infection. Three or four scabs were ground into powder or mixed with a grain of musk and bound in cotton. Infected material was then packed into a pipe and puffed up the patient's nostril. The practice of variolation is believed to have been ritualized by the Chinese. The blowpipe used during the procedure was made of silver. The right nostril was used for boys and the left for girls. Variolated cases were treated as if they were as infectious as those who had acquired the disease naturally. These patients were subsequently kept apart from others until the rash had cleared. Two reports on the Chinese practice were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China, and another by the physician Clopton Havers. But no action was taken. India India has been suggested as another possible origin for the spread of variolation into Europe, particularly the Ottoman Empire and Wales. There are two accounts from the 18th century of inoculations being performed by itinerant Brahmins: Oliver Coult in 1731 wrote that it had been \\"first performed by Dununtary a physician of Champanagar\\" about 150 years before that time (Dhanvantari being the name of the Hindu God of medicine, and a common name among physicians), and John Zephaniah Holwell in 1768 wrote of its being practiced for many hundreds of years. Aspects of these accounts have been called into question, but at any rate, by 1768 inoculation was being practiced in Bengal. The doctors who performed this procedure were known as Tikadars. The term 'tika' is still in use now to mean vaccination in many Indian languages. Sudan Similar methods were seen through the Middle East and Africa. Two similar methods were described in Sudan during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Both had been long established and stemmed from Arabic practices. Tishteree el Jidderi (\\"buying the smallpox\\") was a practice seen within the women of Sennar in Central Sudan. A mother of an unprotected child would visit the house of a newly infected child and tie a cotton cloth around the ailing child's arm. She would then haggle with the child's mother over the cost of each pustule. When a bargain was struck, the woman would return home and tie the cloth around her own child's arm. Variations of this practice included bringing gifts to the donor. The second method was known as Dak el Jedri (\\"hitting the smallpox\\"), a method similar to that used in the Ottoman Empire and eventually transported into England. Fluid was collected from a smallpox pustule and rubbed into a cut made into the patient's skin. This practice spread more widely through Africa. It may have also traveled with merchants and pilgrims along the middle-eastern caravan routes into Turkey and Greece. Spread into Western Europe Introduction Although variolation had become common practice in China and much of Africa by the seventeenth century, Western European medicine still saw the practice as being nothing more than folklore. For instance, letters from physicians in Wales published in 1722 indicated its local use from as early as 1600 near the Welsh port of Haverfordwest. Another reference to variolation is by Thomas Bartholin in 1675. It would not be until Italian physician Dr. Emmanuel Timoni of Constantinople promoted the practice that variolation began its spread through Western Europe. After coming across the practice in Istanbul, Timoni wrote a letter describing the method in detail which was later published in the Philosophical Transactions in early 1714. His account would become the first medical account of variolation to appear in Europe. Although the article did not gain widespread notoriety, it caught the attention of two important figures in the variolation movement, Bostonian preacher Cotton Mather and the wife of the British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu No stranger to smallpox, Lady Mary had lost her brother to the devastating disease. Soon afterwards, she also contracted smallpox. Although she survived, she was left with severe facial scarring. While in Turkey she came across the process of variolation as it was introduced and published in Istanbul by two doctors, Emmanuel Timoni and Iacob Pylarino. . She first mentioned variolation in the famous letter to her friend, Sarah Chiswell, in April 1717. in which she enthusiastically recounted the process, which in Istanbul was most commonly administered by experienced elderly women. In 1718, she had the procedure conducted on her five-year-old son, Edward Montagu. The procedure was supervised by the embassy doctor Charles Maitland. On her return to England, she had her four-year-old daughter variolated in the presence of physicians of the Royal Court in 1721. Both variolations proved successful. Later on that year Maitland conducted an experimental variolation of six prisoners in Newgate Prison in London. In the experiment, six condemned prisoners were variolated and later exposed to smallpox with the promise of freedom if they survived. The experiment was a success, and soon variolation was drawing attention from the royal family, who helped promote the procedure throughout England. However, variolation caused the death of Prince Octavius of Great Britain, eighth son and thirteenth child of King George III in 1783. Portrait of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu Despite opposition, variolation established itself as a mainstream medical treatment in England. Part of its success was founded on statistical observation, which confirmed that variolation was a safer alternative to contracting smallpox naturally, strengthened by the assumption that it protected against the disease for life. The major faults of variolation lay in its simplicity. Doctors sought to monopolize the simple treatment by convincing the public that the procedure could only be done by a trained professional. The procedure was now preceded by a severe bloodletting, in which the patient was bled, often to faintness, in order to 'purify' the blood and prevent fever. Doctors also began to favour deep incisions, which also discouraged amateurs. The Suttonian Method The main proponents of the English variolation movement were the Suttons, a family of physicians who would revolutionize the practice. The patriarch, Robert Sutton, was a surgeon from Suffolk. In 1757 the procedure failed on one of his sons. He sought a new method in which the procedure would become as mild as possible. By 1762 he began advertising \\"A New Method of Inoculating for Small-Pox.\\" Sutton kept his method a secret and shared it only with his three sons. The mystique and effectiveness behind this new method helped to promote their business, which soon became very successful. They established a network of variolation houses and clinics and offered franchises to other variolators for a share of the profits, on condition that the secret would not be revealed. By 1770, the Suttons had treated over 300,000 satisfied customers. Daniel, the eldest of the Sutton sons, eventually revealed the family secret in his book The Inoculator, published in 1796. The success of their method lay in a shallow scratch, careful selection of only mildly affected donors, and no bleeding or extreme purging. Although the renown of the Suttons gradually faded after this revelation, the family's lasting impression would remain for generations. Thomas Nettleton (1683‚Äì1748) was a precursor of the Suttons around 1722. Other prominent English variolators included Thomas Dimsdale, who published accounts of his method in 1769 and 1781; William Woodville, appointed Director of the London Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital in 1791, who published a history of variolation in 1796; and John Haygarth, who published an ambitious plan to exterminate smallpox in 1783. Johnnie Notions John Williamson, more commonly known by the nickname Johnnie Notions, was a self-taught physician from Shetland, Scotland, who independently developed and successfully administered a variolation for smallpox to thousands of patients in Shetland during the late 18th century. Despite having only an elementary education and no formal medical background, the effectiveness of the treatment he devised yielded an extremely high success rate, resulting in the immunisation of approximately 3,000 people and the saving of many lives, which had a significant effect on the demographics of the Shetland population at the time. He is reputed to have not lost a single patient. Notions would first collect small pox pus. He would then dry it using peat smoke (which was believed to lessen the virus's virulence), and bury it in the ground with camphor (which has anti-bacterial properties, preventing the matter from decomposing). Oral history indicates the matter was spread between sheets of glass before burial. It would be kept in this state for up to 7 or 8 years to reduce its virulence before being administered to a patient. By using a knife (which Notions made himself) he would incise into the patient's arm intradermally (without drawing blood), insert a small amount of the matter, and immediately cover the incision with the patient's skin, before using a cabbage leaf as a plaster. In contrast to contemporaneous quack doctors, Notions would not stipulate any particular resting conditions (such as \\"hot-treatment\\" ‚Äì heating the ill patient in front of a fire, covering them with blankets and allowing them no fresh-air), nor would he administer any other medicines during the period of infection and recovery. Notions' variolation bears a strong similarity to the Suttonian method. How Notions became aware of this method of variolation is unclear ‚Äì it may have been through written account, or through discussion with someone else aware of the technique, such as another physician or a member of the clergy. Widespread recognition In 1738, variolation was added to the second edition of Chambers' Cyclop√¶dia, which in its time was an authority of knowledge for the literary class. Later in 1754, variolation received the sanction of the Royal College of Physicians. All of this made England the international center of variolation, attracting visitors from all over the world to explore this \\"new\\" method of prevention. The nation also acted as a magnet for those who sought to introduce the benefits of variolation to their own countries. A remarkable example of this is the introduction of variolation into Russia. Thomas Dimsdale, a prominent banker, politician, and physician, was invited to visit St Petersburg to variolate Catherine the Great. In 1769, he variolated Catherine, her 14-year-old son Grand Duke Paul, and over 140 prominent members of the Court. The results were successful. Dimsdale was created a baron of the Russian Empire, awarded ¬£10,000, with ¬£2000 for expenses and an annuity of ¬£500. His son, who accompanied him, was also rewarded. In case Dimsdale's variolations had ended badly, Catherine had arranged a relay of horses to carry them safely out of the country. France was the last European country to embrace variolation. It was not until an outbreak of smallpox in Paris in 1752 nearly killed the heir to the French throne that the public embraced the practice after seeing the prince variolated. Similarly in Japan, Chinese merchant Li Jen-Shan proposed the method of traditional Chinese intranasal variolation after a severe smallpox outbreak in Nagasaki in 1744. This led Japanese physician to variolate children using a human smallpox vaccination method during an outbreak in Chikuzen Province from 1789 to 1790. There were no deaths among the children, and they all appeared to be protected. By the end of the eighteenth century, variolation had gained widespread global respect and was thought to be one of the greatest medical successes of its time. It had become the subject of serious medical study, leading physicians like John Haygarth from Chester, England, to explore its application on a larger scale. In 1793 he published A Sketch of a Plan to Exterminate the Small-Pox from Great Britain. This relied on rules summarised by Donald Hopkins; > Systematic inoculation throughout the country, isolation of patients, > decontamination of potentially contaminated fomites, supervised inspectors > responsible for specific districts, rewards for observation of rules for > isolation by poor persons, fines for transgression of those rules, > inspection of vessels at ports, and prayers every Sunday. Its implementation at the time was impractical for logistical reasons and the risk that variolation would spread smallpox. However, with suitable modifications, such as the substitution of vaccination for variolation, it was remarkably similar to the strategy adopted during the World Health Organization's smallpox eradication campaign. Spread into America Documentation of variolation in the Americas may be traced back to 1706 in Boston, where Puritan minister Cotton Mather learned of the technique from his West African slave Onesimus. Further research into the matter revealed to Mather that several other slaves had too been variolated. In 1714, he came across Timoni's article in Philosophical Transactions, in which he described methods of variolation found in Turkey. Mather was able to implement this new method in 1721 when Boston suffered a smallpox outbreak, although others such as William Douglass strongly opposed the idea. The main arguments against variolation were on religious grounds. Because religion was never far from any aspect of life in eighteenth-century Boston, several wondered how this new method would coincide with religious teachings. The simplest debate argued that variolation was ungodly because it was not mentioned specifically in the Bible. Inoculation was also viewed by some as a direct affront to God's innate right to determine who was to die, and how and when death would occur. Several believed smallpox outbreaks were well-merited punishments for the sins of those who contracted the disease. Those who were empirically minded saw the notion of using the products of such a deadly disease to prevent said disease as being an insult to logic. Despite these persistent arguments, Mather also gained several supporters. Among this group of followers was surgeon Zabdiel Boylston, who urged Mather to further promote the procedure. With the support of Mather, Boylston went on to successfully variolate 300 patients, with only six of them dying. By contrast, 1,000 of the 6,000 people who acquired smallpox naturally died during the same period. Boylston traveled to London in 1724. There he published his results and was elected to the Royal Society in 1726. From Boston, the practice spread throughout the colonies. In 1775, George Washington ordered that the Continental Army be variolated. By the end of the American Revolutionary War, variolation had gained widespread acceptance in the larger cities and towns of the United States. Transition into vaccination The success of variolation led many, including medical professionals, to overlook its drawbacks. Variolation was practiced on the basis that it protected against smallpox for life, and was far less likely to kill than natural infection. In some cases however, natural smallpox or variolation failed to protect from a second attack. These cases were a result of a lapse of immune \\"memory\\", while others may have been misdiagnosed (experts often confused smallpox with chickenpox). Variolation also required a level of skill and attention to detail which some physicians lacked. Many physicians failed to take note of local redness and discharge to assure the variolation had taken, resulting in inadequate treatment. However, it was its great risk to others that led to the end of the practice. The collateral smallpox cases spread by variolated subjects shortly after variolation began to outweigh the benefits of the procedure. From the 1760s, a number of individuals, including John Fewster, Peter Plett, Benjamin Jesty, and particularly Edward Jenner, were interested in the use of material from cowpox, an animal infection, to protect against smallpox. In 1796, Jenner vaccinated James Phipps, did more vaccinations in 1798, and was the first to publish evidence that cowpox protected against smallpox, was safer than variolation, and that his vaccine could be maintained by arm-to-arm transfer. The use of variolation soon began to decline as the smallpox vaccine became widely used and its benefits appreciated. Various countries made variolation illegal, starting with Russia in 1805. Variolation served as a natural precursor to the discovery of vaccination. The major differences between the two were that in vaccination, material from cowpox, an animal disease, was used, but particularly that it was safe to those vaccinated and was not transmitted to their contacts. Vaccination offered the public a less-harmful method of preventing smallpox. Vaccination would revolutionize the control of smallpox, leading to its eventual eradication. The extension of the principle of vaccination by Pasteur and his successors would lead to the development of vaccines for diseases such as diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza, and make the eradication of infectious diseases, particularly poliomyelitis, a realistic prospect. Decline Although variolation eventually declined or was banned in some countries, it was still practiced in others. \\"Buying the smallpox\\" was still practiced in Sudan until the late nineteenth century. However, variolation survived longer elsewhere. During the World Health Organization's Smallpox Eradication Campaign, vaccination teams came across variolators in remote areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan and their samples were confiscated. In the early stages of the campaign, live virus was detected in some, but as the campaign progressed variolators could not replenish their stocks, and although virus particles were detected in some samples, very few contained live virus. Our knowledge about the survival of smallpox virus suggests that passage of time makes it extremely unlikely that any infectious samples have survived. Other diseases Although variolation has ceased, it has influenced the concept of other traditional practices, such as \\"pox parties\\", in which children are intentionally exposed to diseases like chickenpox, measles and rubella, in an attempt to gain immunity. Although strongly discouraged by public health officials, the practice persists. While intentional exposure has been rejected as a strategy to combat COVID-19 because of the risks involved, there is also a hypothesis that widespread to universal use of face coverings, which tend to be less than perfect, is associated with a higher proportion of asymptomatic or relatively mild infections because of the decreased dose of viral particles expelled or received by the wearer, as a welcome addition to their primary purpose of significantly reducing transmission by asymptomatic wearers.

There are various studies that indicate varying degrees of connections between Sri Lankan Tamils, Sinhalese and Indian ethnic groups. Study by Dr. Gautam K. Kshatriya According to a genetic admixture study by Dr. Gautam K. Kshatriya in 1995, the Sri Lankan Tamil are closely related to the Sinhalese who are closely related to Indian Tamils. Kshatriya found the Sri Lankan Tamils to have a greater contribution from the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka (55.20% +/- 9.47) while the Sinhalese had the greatest contribution from South Indian Tamils (69.86% +/- 0.61), followed by Bengalis from the East India (25.41% +/- 0.51). With both the Sri Lankan Tamils and Sinhalese in the island sharing a common gene pool of 55%. They are farthest from the indigenous Veddahs. This close relationship between the Sri Lankan Tamils and Sinhalese makes sense, as the two populations have been close to each other historically, linguistically, and culturally for over 2000 years. This is also supported by a genetic distance study, which showed low differences in genetic distance between Tamils and the Sinhalese. Tamils and the Sinhalese also share similar cultures in terms of kinship classification, cousin marriage, dress and housing. However, these studies do not consider various diverse Veddah groups: Veddahs have a higher diversity between groups than Sinhalese and Tamils do. Later studies have established some connections and links between certain Veddah groups towards North and Sri Lankan Tamils. The observation that the Sinhalese has highest contribution from South Indian Tamils is challenged by new studies. See Genetic studies on Sinhalese. It is shown that 72% of genetic admixture comes from Bengali rather than South Indian Tamil. Other studies Furthermore, a study looking at genetic variation of the FUT2 gene in the Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhalese population, found similar genetic backgrounds for both ethnic groups, with little genetic flow from other neighbouring Asian population groups. Studies have also found no significant difference with regards to blood group, blood genetic markers and single-nucleotide polymorphism between the Sri Lankan Tamils and other ethnic groups in Sri Lanka.

The widely acclaimed Russian director Sergei Eisenstein was hired to film an adaption, with Dreiser's enthusiastic support. When Eisenstein was unable to get studio approval for his \\"deterministic treatment\\", reflecting a Marxist perspective, he abandoned the project. Paramount, with $500,000 already invested in the film, enlisted Josef von Sternberg to develop and direct his own film version of the novel. Dreiser was guaranteed by contract the right to review the script before production, and complained bitterly that the Sternberg- Hoffenstein interpretation of his novel's themes \\"outraged the book.\\" When the movie was completed, it was clear that the Sternberg screenplay had rejected any interpretation attributing protagonist Clyde Griffiths' anti-social behavior to a capitalist society and a strict religious upbringing, but rather, located the problem in \\"the sexual hypocrisy of the [petty-bourgeois] social class.\\" As Sternberg acknowledged in his memoirs: \\"I eliminated the sociological elements, which, in my opinion, were far from being responsible for the dramatic accident with which Dreiser concerned himself.\\" Dreiser sued Paramount Pictures to suppress the film, and lost. Critical response Film historian John Baxter reports that An American Tragedy \\"met with mixed critical success. The New York Times called it 'emphatically stirring,\\" the New York Daily News wrote it is 'intensely dramatic, moving, superbly acted', but many other papers, recalling Dreiser's protest, found the film less intense that the original novel, which is undoubtedly the case\\". Marxist film critic Harry Alan Potamkin commented on \\"Sternberg's failure to understand Dreiser's larger thematic purpose: Before the story opens [Sternberg presents] repeated shots of water disturbed by a thrown object. And throughout the picture the captions are composed upon a background of rippling water. Sternberg saw the major idea of the matter [theme] in the drowning. How lamentable!\\" The film fared poorly at American theatres, but was well-received among European moviegoers. By 1932, Sternberg's career was at its zenith, with Vanity Fair equating his talents with those of famed Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein, and Berlin's journal of film Der Querschnitt ranking him as among America's creative elite.

They provide a novel framework for solving the credit assignment problem. The framework introduces a novel approach to solving Markov decision processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning problems, using multiscale spectral and manifold learning methods. Proto-value functions are generated by spectral analysis of a graph, using the graph Laplacian. Proto-value functions were first introduced in the context of reinforcement learning by Sridhar Mahadevan in his paper, Proto-Value Functions: Developmental Reinforcement Learning at ICML 2005.Mahadevan, S. Proto-Value Functions: Developmental Reinforcement Learning. Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning ICML 2005  Motivation  Value function approximation is a critical component to solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) defined over a continuous state space. A good function approximator allows a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to accurately represent the value of any state it has experienced, without explicitly storing its value. Linear function approximation using basis functions is a common way of constructing a value function approximation, like radial basis functions, polynomial state encodings, and CMACs. However, parameters associated with these basis functions often require significant domain-specific hand-engineering.Johns, J. and Mahadevan, S., Constructing Basis Functions from Directed Graphs for Value Function Approximation, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2007 Proto-value functions attempts to solve this required hand-engineering by accounting for the underlying manifold structure of the problem domain.  Overview  Proto- value functions are task-independent global basis functions that collectively span the entire space of possible value functions for a given state space. They incorporate geometric constraints intrinsic to the environment. For example, states close in Euclidean distance (such as states on opposite sides of a wall) may be far apart in manifold space. Previous approaches to this nonlinearity problem lacked a broad theoretical framework, and consequently have only been explored in the context of discrete MDPs. Proto-value functions arise from reformulating the problem of value function approximation as real- valued function approximation on a graph or manifold. This results in broader applicability of the learned bases and enables a new class of learning algorithms, which learn representations and policies at the same time.Mahadevan, S. and Maggiono, M., Proto-Value Functions: A Laplacian Framework for Learning Representation and Control in Markov Decision Processes, University of Massachusetts, Department of Computer Science Technical Report TR-2006-35, 2006  Basis functions from graph Laplacian  In this approach, we will construct the basis functions by spectral analysis of the graph Laplacian, a self-adjoint (or symmetric) operator on the space of functions on the graph, closely related to the random walk operator. For the sake of simplicity, assume that the underlying state space can be represented as an undirected unweighted graph G=(V,E) The combinatorial Laplacian L is defined as the operator L = D - A , where D is a diagonal matrix called the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix. The spectral analysis of the Laplace operator on a graph consists of finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions which solve the equation : L\\\\varphi_\\\\lambda = \\\\lambda\\\\varphi_\\\\lambda, where L is the combinatorial Laplacian, \\\\varphi_\\\\lambda is an eigenfunction associated with the eigenvalue \\\\lambda. Here the term \\"eigenfunction\\" is used to denote what is traditionally referred to as eigenvector in linear algebra, because the Laplacian eigenvectors can naturally be viewed as functions that map each vertex to a real number. The combinatorial Laplacian is not the only operator on graphs to select from. Other possible graph operators include: *Normalized Laplacian L_\\\\text{normalized} = I - D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2} Mahadevan, S. and Maggiono, M., ICML 2006 tutorial. *Random Walk P = D^{-1}A  Graph construction on discrete state space  For a finite state space the graph G mentioned above can be simply constructed by examining the connections between states. Let S_i and S_j be any two states. Then : G_{i,j}=\\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } S_i\\\\leftrightarrow S_j \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} It is important to note that this can only be done when the state space is finite and of reasonable size.  Graph construction on continuous or large state space  For a continuous state space or simply a very large discrete state space, it is necessary to sample from the manifold in state space. Then constructing the Graph G based on the samples. There are a few issues to consider here: * How to sample the manifold ** Random walk or guided exploration * How to determine if two sample should be connected  Application  Once the PVFs are generated, they can be plugged into a traditional function approximation framework. One such method is least-squares approximation.  Least-squares approximation using proto-value functions  Let \\\\Phi_G=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ V_1^G,\\\\dots,V_k^G\\\\right\\\\\\\\} be the basis set of PVFs, where each V_i^G is the eigenfunction defined over all states in the graph G. Let \\\\widehat{V}^\\\\pi be the target value function that is only known for a subset of states S_M^G =\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ s_1,\\\\dots,s_m\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Define the gram matrix : K_G =\\\\left(\\\\Phi_m^G \\\\right)^T \\\\Phi_m^G. here S_m^G is the component wise projection of the PVFs onto the states in S_G^m. Hence, each entry of the gram matrix is :K_G(i,j) = \\\\sum_k V_i^G(k) V_j^G (k) Now the we can solve for the coefficients that minimize the least squares error with the equation : \\\\alpha=K_G^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\Phi_M^G \\\\right)^T \\\\widehat{V}^\\\\pi. A nonlinear least- squares approach is possible by using the k PVFs with the largest absolute coefficients to compute the approximation.

It has an innovative structure which acts as a prodrug, breaking down in the body to release both the PDE5 inhibitor aildenafil as well as free nitric oxide, which have powerfully synergistic effects. This dual mechanism of action has never been exploited by conventional pharmaceutical companies because of the risks involved; usually combining PDE5 inhibitors with nitric oxide releasers like amyl nitrite is contraindicated as it can cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure that can potentially result in death. Nitrosamines are also generally avoided in drug development as they can often be hepatotoxic, so while the combined mechanisms of action are likely to be effective, this drug also has severe risks of toxicity. Shortly after Venhuis et al. published the suggested structure for nitrosoprodenafil, it was contested by Demizu et al. who suggested the structure was an azathioprine/aildenafil hybrid. This newly suggested structure was dubbed 'mutaprodenafil' because of the structural similarity with the mutagenic azathioprine. The final confirmation of the azathioprine/aildenafil hybrid was provided by Sakamoto et al. who prepared crystals for X-ray analysis.

Comedic journalism has been applied to print media in the past but has experienced a resurgence through the medium of television with shows such as The Daily Show, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, and The Rick Mercer Report. Conversely, there has been much criticism about defining these media outlets as ‚Äújournalism‚Äù, since some scholars believe there should be a distinction kept between comedy and journalism. History in Canada An early example of comedic journalism in Canada is Frank magazine, founded in Nova Scotia in 1987. According to their website, Frank is a source of news, satire, opinion, comment and humour. They were inspired by the UK magazine Private Eye, which also uses satire and comedy when reporting on current affairs. Frank not only focuses on current affairs, but also existing stories long after they have disappeared from mainstream news media. Many consider the magazine to be a ‚Äúscandal sheet‚Äù, a news source that should not be taken seriously. However, Frank magazine's counter-argument is that the only thing ‚Äúwicked‚Äù about them is how they expose the sins of others.Frank Magazine. 2008. Web. 17 Oct. 2011. In 1989, Frank magazine also started circulating in Ottawa. This version of the magazine was not as popular as the original and stopped circulation both in print and online in 2008. Publisher Michael Bates believed that the downfall of the magazine was the rise in popularity of the satirical form of journalism in the twenty-first century. He explained that they had the field of satirical journalism to themselves in the 1990s, but more publications started to pick up this form of journalism and the Ottawa magazine could no longer compete. He also mentioned the rise of the internet as a cause for the new popularity of this form of media.Wagner, Vit. \\"Frank Magazine Folds.\\" The Star. 28 Oct. 2008. Web. 18 Nov. 2011. . Cultural effects  Carey's transmission theory James W. Carey did not believe that journalists could be defined as conveyors of information. Instead, he presented two alternate viewpoints of communication: the transmission view of communication and the ritual view of communication. The transmission view of communication highlights the importance of information being sent out over large distances in order to convey knowledge and ideas to a mass audience. This viewpoint is more commonly seen in industrial communities where focus is put on the extension of the message. Alternatively, the ritual viewpoint of communication focuses more on the sharing of information amongst a large group of people. Therefore, the focus is not on the extension of the message, but towards the maintenance of society over time. Carey argued that this viewpoint is not as prevalent in American society because the concept of culture is weak in American social thought.Carey, James W. \\"Chapter One: A Cultural Approach to Communication.\\" Communication as Culture: Essays on Media and Society. New York: Routledge, 2009. 11‚Äì28. Carey's transmission viewpoint of communication is evident in traditional forms of journalism because the main purpose is to report the news in an objective manner in order to transmit information to a mass audience without any external viewpoints being included. This form of journalism is very informational and acts as an instrument for disseminating news and information in a packaged format across large distances. An example of this would be daily newspapers because they are packaged and send out bits of information, their sole purpose being to transmit the news to a mass audience. Alternatively, comedic journalism employs a ritualistic viewpoint of communication in the way it presents the news. Their main focus is not just to transmit information, but to place that information in a cultural context. This form of journalism reports news in a subjective manner in order to portray the information in a particular way. Therefore, comedic journalists are able to integrate different cultural viewpoints in their reporting of the news, which creates an element of community amongst their audience. Community Journalist Katerina Cizek describes the importance of the relationship between journalism and community in her article ‚ÄúWhen Community and Journalism Converge‚Äù. Cizek claims that she encountered journalism only when she had come to an understanding of community. In the summer of 1990, Cizek was assigned as a photojournalist on the Oka Crisis in Ottawa. This involved a confrontation between the Canadian government and armed forces against a Mohawk community. Experiencing the event first-hand and later watching the events through news media, Cizek realized the troubling disconnect between what she was watching and what had actually occurred. The news reports did not accurately represent the views of the Mohawk community that she had witnessed. Those who did report on the community's interests were ridiculed and accused of Stockholm syndrome. Therefore, traditional news media would only accept the viewpoints of those in power and ignored the importance of the community's viewpoint.Cizek, Katerina. \\"When community and journalism converge: '...

Mayer proposes a new element that needs to be integrated in today's journalism which is the obligation to make a connection with those they are reporting to. This stems from her issue with the separation between journalists and community. She blames this distancing on the notion of objectivity that is prevalent in traditional forms of news media. This is because journalists are forced to make a disconnection in order to report the news in a fair manner.Mayer, Joy. \\"Engaging communities: content and conversation: 'editors ought to require that story pitches and budget lines include an engagement component, reflecting community conversation, collaboration and outreach.'\\" Nieman Reports 65.2 (2011): 12+.

Effect of cynicism and sensationalism Comedic journalism has attracted a large following, and one cause is the increasing cynicism found in and inspired by traditional news sources. Since the income of a news source is tied to their number of viewers, many news sources will do whatever it takes to gain the public's attention. This includes reporting on the information journalists and media elite genuinely think the public should know, however, this also includes alternative attention-drawing tactics such as ‚Äúattack journalism,‚Äù portraying politics as ‚Äúendlessly adversarial,‚Äù and contributing to a ‚Äúfeeding frenzy,‚Äù or excessive press coverage of an embarrassing or scandalous subject.Barbour, Christine, Gerald C. Wright, Matthew J. Streb, and Michael R. Wolf. Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics. Washington, DC: CQ, 2006. Print. Scandals and drama are effective in drawing viewers, but facing negative topics or the sensational reporting style again and again can frustrate viewers. The comedic, satirical portrayal of happenings in comedy news sources can offer an alternative method of receiving news, one that is frequently received in a positive light due to its entertaining qualities. This in turn has enabled comedic journalism to not just survive in the competitive world of news coverage, but to thrive in drawing significant audiences. With the range of their voice, the influential capability of comedic journalism grows. As satire Joe Hale Cutbirth in his article ‚ÄúSatire as Journalism: The Daily Show and American Politics at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century‚Äù explains the recent popularity of satirical journalism and relates this to the sense of community that viewers feel through this form of journalism. In comparison to traditional forms of news media, which are objective and authoritative, current forms of news media have evolved with popularity due to an independent and personal voice that is reporting the news to viewers with tools such as comedy and satire. Cutbirth uses the example of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where news events are reported in a satirical manner by comedian Jon Stewart. Through his form of news reporting, audiences are able to make a connection to the news he is reporting on and feel as though their concerns and values are being incorporated in the news. Stewart is using comedy as a form of communication which provides the audience with a sense of emotion that they do not get with traditional news media. Cutbirth also raises Carey's argument on the significance of journalism for the public sphere. He argues that if news sources only reflect the interests of few (usually the elites in society), people will not involve themselves in public life. Therefore, by Stewart's integration of different viewpoints and emotions on news events, his viewers feel they can relate to Stewart and others who are also following his show, creating a sense of community and integration into public life.Cutbirth, J. H. (2011). Satire as journalism: \\"The Daily Show\\" and American Politics at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century. (Communications). . Examples The following three television shows can be viewed as modern examples of comedic journalism. The hosts of these shows report on current news events, using a comedic tone to highlight the issues that the audience should take away from the reports. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart The Daily Show with Jon Stewart started in January 1999, when Jon Stewart took over the hosting position from Craig Kilborn. The show was presented as a comedy show where news was reported in a satirical manner, mocking the way it was originally presented and reported in traditional forms of news media. Stewart has long denied considering himself a journalist and claims that his show reports on ‚Äúfake news‚Äù. However, studies have shown that many young adults rely on his show for political information. In one survey, Stewart was voted the most trusted news source in the United States. The satirical nature of his show has exposed flaws in the objective news reporting of traditional media. As a result, audiences have turned to Stewart for a more intellectual and emotional account of news, which was lacking in their experience with traditional news media. Geoffrey Baym also argues that The Daily Show is not ‚Äúfake news‚Äù, but a new form of journalism that draws on the genres of news, comedy, and television talk shows in order to report in a critical and democratic manner. In Season 15, Episode 161, Stewart invites four 9/11 first responders onto the show, all of whom were dying as a result of their involvement during 9/11. Stewart speaks to the men about the Bill that was being passed to add health related funds for people involved in 9/11. Before their appearance on this show, the Republicans were still deciding if the law should be passed. Although Stewart reported this news in a humorous manner, this form of journalism had such an impact that the Republicans felt ‚Äúembarrassed‚Äù by what was shown on his show and passed the law. In a New York Times article written about this episode, Stewart is compared to Edward R. Murrow, a famous journalist in the past, legitimizing him as a journalist.Carter, Bill, and Brian Stelter. \\"In ‚ÄòDaily Show‚Äô Role on 9/11 Bill, Echoes of Murrow.\\" New York Times, 26 Dec. 2010. Web. 14 Oct. 2011. . The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ended in 2015 and replaced with The Daily Show with Trevor Noah. The Colbert Report The Colbert Report started in October 2005 with Stephen Colbert as the host, writer and executive producer of the show. Like Stewart, Colbert reports the news in a satirical manner, focusing on political news.\\"About The Show.\\" Colbert Nation  The Colbert Report  Comedy Central. Web. 17 Nov. 2011.. He uses different segments in his episodes such as, ‚ÄúTip of the Hat, Wag of the Finger‚Äù and ‚ÄúBears and Balls‚Äù. During these segments, Colbert discusses current news events and does not hold back from sharing his opinion on the stories. As he puts it in one episode, he not only gives his audience his two cents worth, but a whole bag of quarters.Colbert, Stephen. \\"Season 7 Episode 83 - Michael Moore.\\" The Colbert Report. Comedy Central. New York, 28 Mar. 2011. The cheers of the audience as he reports these segments illuminates the feelings of a community because the viewer knows there is a group of people who are laughing at Colbert along with themselves. Also, his high strung attitude in his reports creates a feeling of passion with the stories he is reporting on, causing the audience to have a deeper emotional connection with the news events that he reports on. In season five of The Colbert Report, Colbert launched his series of ‚ÄúOperation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando‚Äù where he taped his shows in Iraq and became the first TV show in US history to produce shows in a combat zone. Although the title of the series is comedic, Colbert pushes the limit of journalism and gives his viewers a closer look at one of the most prevalent current affairs in the United States. He was bothered by the fact that the economic crisis in the United States had become the prevalent issue in the news. Not only did he start reporting on the War in Iraq more frequently, but actually reported on- scene in order to give his audience a deeper connection to the issue at hand.CBC News. \\"Colbert Baghdad-bound for 'Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando' - Arts & Entertainment - CBC News.\\" CBC.ca - Canadian News Sports Entertainment Kids Docs Radio TV. Web. 17 Nov. 2011. . Colbert Report ended on December 18, 2014 when Stephen Colbert became the host of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The Rick Mercer Report Like Stewart and Colbert, Mercer reports current events in Canada in a satirical manner on The Rick Mercer Report. The show takes the connection of comedic journalism and community a step further by incorporating forms of investigative journalism. Mercer frequently travels around Canada and uses techniques of investigative journalism to report on a wide range of topics. Mercer details his travels in his book, Rick Mercer Report: The Book, and also discusses certain political current events that were occurring at the time of each episode. For example, Mercer travelled with the different political parties during their election campaigns in order to gain a personal account of the event.Mercer, Rick. Rick Mercer Report: The Book, [Toronto]: Doubleday Canada, 2007. Print. Although Mercer focuses on political events, he also covers many other issues that Canadians can relate to, such as environmental and economic issues. During the 2011 federal elections, Mercer urged youth to become politically active and give themselves a voice by voting. After his show aired, students from the University of Guelph created a ‚Äúvote mob‚Äù, advocating for issues they believed affected their age group, such as harsh drug laws and lowering tuition fees. The vote mob was also created to encourage students at other universities to do the same. The low number of young voters has continued to be a problem in elections over the years, regardless of the number of reports that have previously been done. However, with Rick Mercer's form of comedic journalism, he was successful in making a connection with these young voters and pushing them to make a change.Galloway, Gloria. \\"Campus Vote Mob Heeds Rick Mercer‚Äôs Call to Arms - The Globe and Mail.\\" The Globe and Mail. 1 Apr. 2011. Web. 17 Nov. 2011. . Last Week Tonight with John Oliver John Oliver was a long- time correspondent on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. During the summer of 2013 he hosted the Daily Show while Jon Stewart was filming Rosewater. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver started in April 2014. The debate on comedic journalism: can it be defined as journalism? There are critiques of comedic journalism, as some scholars and journalists argue that comedy cannot be seen as a valid form of journalism. They stress the importance of traditional news media and its objective nature in reporting the news. Ed Fouhy, a retired producer and network executive, claims that comedic journalism cannot be viewed as a serious source of information. Robert Thompson, director of a popular culture program at Syracuse University, adds that journalists should be more concerned with providing correct information than appealing to a younger audience and trying to be more ‚Äúhip‚Äù.Smolkin, Rachel. \\"What the Mainstream Media Can Learn From Jon Stewart  American Journalism Review.\\" American Journalism Review. Web. 18 Nov. 2011. . However, comedic journalists use these traditional news forms to gather their information and report it in a more subjective manner. The news stories they report on are the same stories reported by mainstream news media; however, comedic journalism reports them in a different way. Having the same news reported with a different tone is something many people are starting to prefer; as Cutbirth mentions in his article, many people would rather turn to these new forms of media because of the personal and subjective viewpoints they give. This is demonstrated by a study in which American citizens voted Jon Stewart their most trusted news source. Viewers seem more trusting of their sources when they feel an emotional connection to the news reports. One article in the American Journalism Review suggests that mainstream media can actually learn from the journalistic form of Jon Stewart. Professor Brown, chair of the communications department at Syracuse University and an associate professor of broadcast journalism, was once a skeptic of Stewart's form of comedy journalism, which he referred to as, ‚Äúsilly riffing‚Äù. However, at the start of the war in Iraq, Brown felt as though the traditional form of journalism in the mainstream media was not providing a fair account of the event. He claims that they were, ‚Äúswallowing the administration‚Äôs spin rather than challenging it‚Äù. Stewart, on the other hand, was successful in covering the stories with various viewpoints in mind and therefore, steered closer to the truth than the mainstream journalists. Phil Rosenthal, a media columnist for the Chicago Tribune, draws on the fact that a big part of the news nowadays is the managing of the news. Comedic journalists such as Stewart and Colbert not only expose the subjects in the news stories, but also how the stories were delivered in the mainstream media. They often show clips of reporters conveying the news stories and mock the information that was provided. This highlights the tension between traditional journalism and this new form that has captured such a large audience. However, bearing in mind that the news from these comedic reports are derived from traditional news sources, Fouhy and others make a valid points that people need the resources for serious news and that people also need comedic journalism to help them sort out truths. Therefore, although comedic journalism is a newer form of journalism, it can work side-by-side with traditional forms for viewers to receive a more complete account of the news.

These properties are love of peace, trust, honesty, justice, love for our fellow man, health, responsibility, and integrity. The symbol has been changed four times since the school's founding. While Toyama Shogyo has no official school mascot, it does have a mascot for the school's biggest event of the year, Tomishop. During Tomishop, the students are given practical experience in stocking, sales, customer support, and advertising by converting the school into a marketplace for one weekend. A round-faced cat named ‚ÄúTominyan‚Äù is the mascot of Tomishop, and is often featured prominently on advertisements, flyers, and posters around the school both during Tomishop and in the weeks preceding it. Tominyan has a female counterpart, which is a character nearly identical in appearance to Tominyan himself, except for a bow she wears near her ear and the absence of Tominyan's three black stripes on top of his head. Uniform The boys‚Äô uniform consists of a blue blazer with the school emblem on the left breast, sweater-vest, also with the school emblem, a white dress-shirt, gray slacks, and a blue necktie, also carrying the school emblem. The uniform is worn slightly differently according to the season. During the summer and warmer months, the blazer and sweater-vest are not worn, while during the fall the sweater-vest is worn without the jacket. In addition to the uniform, students have certain other regulations regarding their appearances. Male students wear sneakers or loafers, with black, white, or gray socks. They must wear a black or brown belt, which must be worn at the waist, not sagging or pulled down onto the hips. They must also wear a crew cut or buzz cut. The upper part of the girls‚Äô uniform is very similar to the boys‚Äô uniform. Girls also wear a blue blazer and/or sweater with the school emblem, a white dress-shirt, and a blue necktie with the school emblem. However, the girls who attend Toyama Shogyo are recognizable by their almost floor-length gray skirts, which are required to extend at least 5 cm below the knee. Female students are instructed to wear simple gloves and scarves on their way to school during the cold months. They must wear athletic shoes or loafers with white socks. During the winter, they may wear black stockings instead of white socks if they so desire. Their hair must either be cut short, or tied back so that it does not fall over the eyes. Both male and female students at Toyama Shogyo use school bags of approximately the same navy blue color as their blazers bearing the school emblem, as well as the word ‚ÄúTomisho,‚Äù written in English.Tomisho Student Handbook Sports Toyama Shogyo High School's sports teams are regular contenders at regional and national events. The clubs include swimming, sumo, cheerleading, Japanese archery, soccer, volleyball, soft tennis, softball, basketball, gymnastics, judo, badminton, baseball, rubber baseball, track and field, tennis, and table tennis.

Mechanism Due to the complex malarial syndrome, there are many pathogenic interactions leading to acute renal failure, such as hypovolemia, intravascular hemolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Malarial acute renal failure prevents the kidneys from efficiently removing excess fluid, electrolytes and waste material from the blood.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kidney-failure/DS00280 The accumulation of these fluids and material will cause adverse consequences for the patient including, electrolyte abnormality and increased urinary protein excretion. Treatment Untreated patients often face a large number of physical complications, but early diagnosis and effective treatment can reduce the high risk of mortality in patients. A three-pronged approach against infection is regularly needed for successful treatment. antimalarial drug therapy (e.g., artemisinin derivatives), fluid replacement (e.g., oral rehydration therapy), and if needed, renal replacement therapy.

Since September 2011, the Occupy movement has spread to over 80 countries and 2,700 towns and cities, including in over 90 cities in the United States alone. The movement has generated reactions from the media, the general public, the United States government, and from international governments. International politicians ' On 15 October 2011, President Dilma Rousseff said, \\"We agree with some of the expressions that some movements have used around the world [in] demonstrations like the ones we see in the US and other countries.\\"Indignados en Brasil: manifestaciones son pac√≠ficas y cuentan con el apoyo de presidenta, La Tercera, October 15, 2011; accessed October 20, 2011. ' On 15 October 2011, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty expressed sympathy with the protests, stating \\"There's growing worry about a lack of opportunities for the younger generation ‚Äî particularly in the United States ‚Äî and it's up to governments to ensure youth are able to capitalize on their education and find good jobs.\\" He later commented, \\"I can understand some legitimate frustration arising out of that.\\"Occupy Wall Street Protests hit Canada . ' In its 2012, May 25 \\"Human Rights Record of the United States in 2011, China consider the Occupy movement's repression as a sign of US abuse on its population, and denial of freedom of speech. ' Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou supported the protests, saying \\"\\"We fight for changing the global economic system, like many anti-Wall Street citizens who rightly protest against the inequalities and injustices of the system.\\" ' On 19 October 2011, Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, described the protests as \\"a warning for all those who are in charge of the processes of governance\\".Occupy Wall Street protests a warning: PM. ' On 12 October 2011, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei voiced his support for the Occupy Movement saying, \\"Ultimately, it will grow so that it will bring down the capitalist system and the West.\\" ' On 21 October 2011, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the protests were about fairness. \\"There are voices in the middle who say, 'Look, we can build a better financial system that is more sustainable, that is based on a better and proportionate sense of what's just and fair and where people don't take reckless risks or, if they do, they're penalized for doing so.' \\"Ex-British Chief Gorden Brown States Protests Seek Fairness. On 6 November 2011, Opposition leader Ed Miliband: \\"The challenge is that they reflect a crisis of concern for millions of people about the biggest issue of our time: the gap between their values and the way our country is run.\\" He mentioned that he is \\"determined that mainstream politics, and the Labour Party in particular, speaks to that crisis and rises to the challenge\\".Ed Miliband warns of St Paul's protest 'danger signals'. On Saturday 26 November 2011, Edinburgh City Council set a worldwide precedent by voting in favour of the motion to support the aims and sentiments of Occupy Edinburgh and the Occupy Movement as a whole. This motion was presented by the Scottish Green Party, was seconded by the Scottish Labour Party and was slightly amended by the SNP and LibDems. The only party not to back the motion was the Conservatives. \\"We regard this as a fantastic step forward in the opening of dialogue with the Scottish government.\\", stated Occupy Edinburgh.Occupy Edinburgh ecstatic with official recognition ' On 16 October 2011, President Barack Obama spoke in support of the movement, but also asked protesters not to \\"demonize\\" finance workers. Local authorities in the United States have collaborated to develop strategies to respond to the Occupy movement and its encampments, and political leaders in eighteen United States cities consulted on cracking down on the Occupy movement, according to Oakland Mayor Jean Quan, who participated in a conference call.AlterNet, 2011 Nov. 15, \\"Oakland Mayor Jean Quan Admits 18 Cities Were Consulting on #Occupy Crackdowns\\" Within a span of less than 24 hours, municipal authorities in Denver, Salt Lake City, Portland, Oakland and New York City sent in police to crack down on the encampments of the Occupy movement.The Takeaway, 2011 Nov. 15, \\"After Ouster, Occupy Oakland Protesters Return,\\" In February 2012, former President Jimmy Carter described the movement as \\"relatively successful\\" due to the way it had raised the profile of economic inequality. ' Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez condemned the \\"horrible repression\\" of the activists and expressed solidarity with the movement. Media An article in the centre-left Labour Party-affiliated British magazine Progress published on 25 November criticised the Occupy protesters as representing \\"an unpalatable smorgasbord of religious, political and cultural ideas.\\" The Korean Central News Agency of North Korea (the state press) has described the Occupy movement as being \\"in protest against exploitation and oppression by capital, shaking all fabrics of society.\\" Xinhua, China's state news agency, said the protests had exposed \\"fundamental problems\\" with the US economic and political systems, and that it showed \\"a clear need for Washington, which habitually rushes to demand other governments to change when there are popular protests in their countries, to put its own house in order.\\" Commentator Keith Olbermann criticized major news outlets for not covering the Occupy movement more in-depth. In November, Jeffery Sachs argued that the Occupy movement marks the start of a new progressive age. On 16th Jan 2012, Kevin Powell argued the Occupy best embodied the spirit of Marin Luther King's campaigning against inequality. Also in January, Financial Times commentator Philip Stephens suggested that the global Occupy movement, with its many strands, still does not present a coherent plan for political change. Public opinion In the US, public support for the Occupy movement appeared to decline slightly from October to December 2011. The approval and disapproval rate hovered around the 50 percent mark, according to national polls. A Public Policy Polling poll in November revealed that around 50 percent of participants supported the movement with 45 percent disapproving of it. However, in a November 2011 a USA Today/Gallup poll reveals that 6 in 10 Americans have no opinion or don't know enough on the Occupy movement's goals. In October 2011, a joint CBS/New York Times poll indicated that around 40 percent of people approved of the Occupy Wall Street movement, while 27 percent disagreed with the movement. A global survey of 23 countries published by Ipsos on 20 January 2012 found that only about 40% of the worlds citizens were familiar with the movement. Over twice as many reported a favourable response to the movement compared to those who dislike it. Support for the movement varied markedly among countries, with South Korea(67%), Indonesia(65%) and India(64%) reporting the highest sympathy - while Australia (41%), Japan (41%) and Poland (37%) reporting the lowest. However, a recent poll in January 2012 by CBS-owned KPIX-TV of San Francisco showed that support for Occupy protests in the San Francisco Bay Area is on the decline. The poll showed that 26% of residents who initially supported the movement now changed their mind. The poll includes Occupy Oakland, Occupy San Francisco, and Occupy San Jose. Other Egyptian protesters from Tahrir Square have lent their support of the movement. A message of solidarity issued by a collective of Cairo-based protesters declared: \\"As the interests of government increasingly cater to the interests and comforts of private, transnational capital, our cities and homes have become progressively more abstract and violent places, subject to the casual ravages of the next economic development or urban renewal scheme. An entire generation across the globe has grown up realizing, rationally and emotionally, that we have no future in the current order of things.\\" In early December 2011, business magnate Richard Branson said the movement is a \\"good start\\",that they have been protesting for valid reasons and that if the business community takes some of their concerns on board they will have made a difference. On 15 December, Jesse Jackson said that Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. were all occupiers, and that: \\"Occupy is a global spirit, which is now sweeping the nation and the world, fighting for justice for all of God's children\\". In February 2012, investment magnate Jeremy Grantham wrote in support of Occupy for the Financial Times, suggesting that the central message of the movement ought to be \\"more sensible assistance for the poor, more taxes for the rich\\". In March 2012 America magazine's Gary Dorrien questions the movement's potential societal influence.Occupy The Future: Can a protest movement find a path to economic democracy?

Under the brand name Choletec it is available from Bracco Diagnostic. Supplied as a sterile kit of mebrofenin and dehydrated stannous fluoride. The vial is reconstituted with 1 to 5 mL up to of sodium pertechnetate solution to form the final radio labeled 99mTc mebrofenin. Upon intravenous administration, 99mTc mebrofenin bound to plasma proteins is cleared from systemic circulation in approximately 5 minutes by hepatocytes, while maximal liver uptake occurs within 11 minutes. Mechanism of mebrofenin entering the gallbladder is thought to occur with a mechanism similar to bilirubin clearance. Normal adult patient (70 kg) dose with normal serum bilirubin levels of less than 1.5 mg/dL is 2 to 5 mCi. Increased serum bilirubin increases renal clearance, decreases hepatic uptake and increases visualization time, thus a higher dose of 3 to 10 mCi is recommended. Doses higher than 10 mCi are seldom used. Obese patients require increased dose of 2 to 3 mCi compared with the normal adult patient dose to obtain proper visualization. Structure Mebrofenin is a chelate composed of two molecules of a lidocaine analogue, attached to a technetium-99m ion. All of the hepatobiliary visualization agents previous to mebrofenin have the same structural composition with changes only of the substituants on the phenyl ring of the lidocaine analogue molecules. Mebrofenin's fast hepatic excretion (t¬Ω=17 minutes) and high hepatic uptake (98.1%) can be attributed to the 3-bromo-2,4,6-trimethylphenyl moiety. To be a good hepatobiliary imaging agent, the chemical structure of mebrofenin has to meet certain requirements: # an organic ion with molecular weight between 300 and 1000 # at least two aromatic rings in the molecule # ability to bind to albumin In normal individuals, uptake of 99mTc mebrofenin by hepatocytes is 100%. Decreased liver uptake is indicative of hepatocyte disease. Once in the hepatocytes, 99mTc mebrofenin is secreted into the canaliculi and finally excreted by the bile ducts. Use Liver The two useful parameters gathered from hepatic uptake of 99mTc mebrofenin, to aid in determining severity of liver disease, is the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) and excretion half-life. HEF is calculated by initial hepatocyte uptake divided by peak vascular uptake. HEF is 100% in normal individuals, in most patients remains close to 100% with partial common bile duct obstruction and in patients with sclerosing cholangitis, but is severely decreased in patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis. Excretion half-life directly correlates with the degree of liver abnormality and can be a predictor of cirrhotic stage. Gallbladder Gallbladder visualization happens once all 99mTc mebrofenin has cleared the liver and enters the gall bladder, the common bile duct and finally the small intestines. Patients fasting for the normal requirement of 4 hours and have normal gallbladder function, the gallbladder is usually visualized within 60 minutes. If the gallbladder is not visualized in 60 minutes, the study can continue for up to 4 hours. To shorten the study, morphine sulfate (MS) can be injected into the patient to increase uptake of 99mTc mebrofenin into the gallbladder. If after 30 minutes of MS administration, the gallbladder is still not visualized, acute cholecystitis can be assumed with greater than 93% specificity. To aid gall bladder emptying, a synthetic cholecystokinin (trade name Kinavec) can be administered. Situations when gall bladder emptying is indicated: # If a patient is suspected to have acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis requires full visualization of the gall bladder, its associated duct work and the surrounding areas. Because a full gallbladder concentrates radioactive tracers, emptying the gallbladder will increase the probability of correctly identifying the cause of the problem. # If gall bladder ejection fraction (GBEF) is to be obtained because patient is suspected to have chronic cholecystitis without gall stones. Decreased GBEF may be indicative of asymptomatic cholelithiasis, which is usually without gallbladder pain. Only pain during gallbladder contraction/emptying and low GBEF can be associated with chronic cholecystitis. Precautions * False positives can be due to administration of MS or meperidine prior to the study, patient in sepsis or if fasting requirements are ignored. * The substance is excreted into the human milk. * The prepared kit must be used within 18 hours of addition of 99mTc.

His great uncles were Johannes Karl von und zu FranckensteinProfile from catholic- hierarchy.org, Article on German Wikipedia (Prince-Bishop of Worms), Johann Martin von Eyb (Prince Bishop of Eichst√§tt) und Marquard Sebastian Schenk von Stauffenberg (Prince-Bishop of Bamberg). Philipp Anton grew up in Franconia, studied canon and civil law at the Pontificium Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum de Urbe in Rome, followed by extensive educational journeys and was appointed canon of Bamberg, shortly after also lord of the cathedral in W√ºrzburg and Mainz. Ecclesiastical career Starting his studies in 1711, Philipp Anton was appointed canon in Bamberg in 1719. Shortly after his nomination he was also accepted as canon by the cathedral chapter of W√ºrzburg and Mainz. On 22 September 1736 Johann Philipp Anton was ordained priest by his predecessor Prince-bishop Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn. He celebrated his primacy on 30 October the same year in Ullstadt. As canon of Mainz he participated in a Dalmatian play at the coronation of Emperor Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor in the Frankfurt Cathedral in 1742, wearing the cross of the crowning archbishop. From 1743 Franckenstein served as Vicar general in the Electorate of Mainz. When Prince-Bishop Friedrich Karl Graf von Sch√∂nborn died on 26 July 1746 in W√ºrzburg, Franckenstein was elected bishop of Bamberg and became his successor with Pope Benedict XIV confirming the appointment on 19 December 1746.

Philipp Anton Franckenstein's arms Seehof Palace Politics and patronage After his election, which was also supported by Empress Maria Theresa (she thanked him for his patriotic sentiments), he quickly reached a settlement with his cathedral chapter as prince-bishop and was able to settle centuries- old disputes. In 1748, Johann Philipp Anton von Frankenstein appointed the artist Ferdinand Dietz, whom he held in high esteem, as his court sculptor. He also brought the painter Giuseppe Appiani to Bamberg and commissioned him to produce a magnificent large ceiling fresco in the White Hall of Seehof Castle. He also promoted the composer Johann Jakob Schnell, who dedicated one of his better known works to him. Philipp Anton was benevolent and popular as prince- bishop, he loved Italian arts and architecture and had the residence and Seehof castle considerably enlarged and renewed. His artistic sense, which was characterized by the Late Baroque, is especially praised. He employed well- known artists for the execution of his plans at great cost. As head shepherd of his diocese he took special care of the training of priests, as head of state, he stood on the side of Habsburg and tried to alleviate the turmoil and horrors of the War of the Austrian Succession. He died on 3 June 1753 in Bamberg and was buried in Bamberg Cathedral. His funeral monument is in Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg.

Robbins founded two influential record labels. The first, Profile Records (in business from 1981 to 1996; Robbins left in 1994), grew to become a large independent label that proved key in the rise of hip-hop as a commercially viable genre, most notably in breaking hip-hop's first multiplatinum act, Run-D.M.C. The second, Robbins Entertainment (founded in 1996), has been a pioneer charting dance music's course into the 21st century. Robbins is currently the owner and president of Robbins Entertainment, which is based in New York City's Tribeca neighborhood. __TOC__  Early life  Robbins was born to Warren and Paula Robbins in Brooklyn, NY. His family spent the first part of his life in Hollis, Queens ‚Äî the same neighborhood where the members of his future artists Run-D.M.C. grew up. Robbins father was a \\"closeout specialist\\" of wholesale clothing and ran a small chain of clothing stores in suburban New York and New Jersey called the Sample Nook. The Robbins family relocated to Rockland County, north of the city, in 1964.  Baskin Robbins rumor  Contrary to some accounts, Cory Robbins was not the heir to any \\"Baskin Robbins\\" fortune. Irvine \\"Irv\\" Robbins, the co-founder of Baskin Robbins, was born in Canada and lived on the West Coast. Cory Robbins' father Warren was in the retail clothing business.  Career  Cory Robbins, circa early 1980s  Midland International  Robbins formed a band in high school called The Centrifugal Force, and wrote songs with the hope of pitching them to publishers, record companies, and artists. In 1974, a 16-year-old Cory Robbins was shopping his songwriting demos in New York City when he met Bob Reno, the head of Midland International Records, which had success with disco tracks like Silver Convention's \\"Fly, Robin, Fly,\\" signed by Midland's A&R; man Eddie O'Loughlin. Reno passed on Robbins' demos, but he eventually offered Robbins a summer job. During Robbins' freshman year in college, Reno coaxed Robbins to drop out and come work for Midland's publishing arm, picking and pitching songs. Robbins left Midland to pursue a career as a DJ and record producer. He sold his first production, \\"Keep It Up\\" by Nightfall, to RCA in 1977 for $4,000. Robbins also produced \\"Doin' The Best That I Can\\" by Bettye LaVette for West End Records in 1978.  Panorama  On a recommendation from Eddie O'Loughlin, in 1977 Cory Robbins landed a job working for MCA Music Publishing, where Robbins signed songwriter/producer Patrick Adams. The deal spawned several disco hits including the classic, \\"(Push Push) In The Bush.\\" Robbins' success led to his being asked, at the age of 21, to run MCA Music Publishing's new record label, Panorama (distributed by RCA Records). At Panorama, Robbins signed groups like Frank Hooker & Positive People and The Fantastic Aleems. And in late 1979, during the novel success of \\"Rapper's Delight\\" by the Sugar Hill Gang, he attempted, unsuccessfully, to sign the first \\"rapping\\" Christmas song. \\"Christmas Rapping\\" by Kurtis Blow ended up on Mercury Records. Earlier that same year, Robbins also signed and produced a Top 5 Billboard disco song called \\"Love Insurance,\\" (co-produced and arranged by Rick Tell) released under the name of Front Page. The songwriter, Steve Plotnicki, became friendly with Robbins, and they began to discuss opening their own record company to release 12-inch singles.  Profile Records  = Founding Profile = Cory Robbins and Steve Plotnicki opened Profile Records in May 1981 with $34,000 in loans from their parents. The first releases on Profile were not successful. Down to their last $2,000, Plotnicki suggested that they spend part of that money recording a rap version of \\"Genius of Love\\" by the Tom Tom Club. Robbins enlisted two rappers, Alonzo Brown and Andre Harrell ‚Äî who called themselves Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde - to perform the song they called \\"Genius Rap,\\" which eventually sold over 150,000 copies and, in effect, saved the company. Robbins and Plotnicki decided to concentrate more of their efforts on rap music, and increased their signings in that area. Profile had another rap hit with the Disco Four (\\"Whip Rap\\"), and its first notable success in R&B; with Sharon Brown's \\"I Specialize In Love.\\" Robbins handled the A&R; and promotion end of the company's affairs, and Plotnicki focused on sales and finance. = Run-D.M.C. = In early 1983, Kurtis Blow's manager, Russell Simmons, brought by an unconventional demo tape from a rap group he called \\"Runde-MC\\" (Simmons' brother Joe as \\"DJ Run\\" and Joe's friend Daryll McDaniels as \\"D.M.C.\\"). Cory Robbins listened to the tape overnight and the next morning made Simmons a $2,000 offer for the group's first single. Run-DMC's first single \\"It's Like That/Sucker M.C.s,\\" was an almost instant smash in the streets of New York City, and ended up a hit on national Black radio, rising to #15 on the Billboard R&B; charts in the Spring of 1983. A string of other successful singles led Profile in 1984 to invest in the company's first rap album, \\"Run-D.M.C.,\\" which became the first- ever rap album to be certified Gold by the RIAA, selling over 500,000 copies. Profile also produced the first-ever video by a rap group to make it onto MTV, Run-D.M.C.'s \\"Rock Box.\\" Run-DMC followed with their second album, \\"King Of Rock,\\" in 1985 (which eventually went Platinum with more than 1,000,000 copies sold) ‚Äî and then \\"Raising Hell\\" in 1986 (the first rap album to be certified Triple-Platinum). Run-D.M.C. became rap's most successful act in the mid 1980s, and buoyed the fortunes of Profile Records and its owners, enabling them to expand their roster and have successes not only in rap ‚Äî with acts like Dana Dane ‚Äî but also in other types of music. = Other genres = Even though most of Profile's creative and financial success stemmed from rap records, Cory Robbins always strove to establish Profile Records as a label with a diverse roster. Profile Records released the instrumental Hip- Hop/breakdance classic \\"Rainforest\\" by Paul Hardcastle, a British electro- and synth-funk artist. Profile Records also signed a pop group called Boys Don't Cry and released their single, \\"I Wanna Be A Cowboy,\\" at an opportune time: the short-lived 1986 major-label boycott of the independent promoters who virtually controlled the programming at much of American pop radio. Robbins took advantage by enlisting the services of those promoters during that lull in corporate business. The result was that \\"I Wanna Be A Cowboy\\" rose to #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, an almost impossible feat for a small, independent label like Profile. Profile Records also had respected artists in the genres of freestyle (Judy Torres), Heavy Metal (Murphy's Law), and eventually Dancehall (Barrington Levy). = The Golden Era = The so-called Golden Era of hip-hop was in some ways was made possible by Profile Records and the success of its main signing, Run-D.M.C. That period of time, from the late 1980s into the early 1990s, was also Profile's greatest period of creative and commercial success. Cory Robbins signed or oversaw the signings of the following artists: Dana Dane, Rob Base & D.J. EZ Rock, Special Ed, Poor Righteous Teachers, DJ Quik, King Sun, 2nd II None, and N2Deep, among others. = Landmark = In the late 1980s, following Profile Records' Gold and Platinum successes with Run-D.M.C., Dana Dane, Rob Base and others, Cory Robbins and Steve Plotnicki entertained distribution and purchase offers from major record conglomerates. Robbins and Plotnicki vowed not to sell off their best assets to major labels ‚Äî as other independents had done ‚Äî and rejected distribution offers. Instead, Profile made a bid to become a \\"mini-major\\" by buying up and/or starting a number of regional record distributors across the country and uniting them into a network, thus giving them national coverage similar to the major labels. The distribution company, Landmark, was an important player in the indie record landscape in the 1990s, also selling records from labels like Tommy Boy and Select. = Endgame = Landmark became a point of tension between Cory Robbins and his partner. Landmark required a certain flow of product from Profile and its other client labels in order to remain profitable. Plotnicki is reported to have urged Robbins to increase the number of annual releases from Profile, a tactic which Robbins resisted, ostensibly for the health and reputation of the mother label. The rift between Robbins and Plotnicki grew throughout 1993 as they fielded yet another purchase offer, this one from Tom Silverman's Tommy Boy Records and its owner, Time Warner. The argument between Robbins and Plotnicki scuttled the Time Warner deal, and in early 1994, Robbins negotiated his departure from Profile Records.  Robbins Entertainment  = Early years = In late 1994, Cory Robbins began talks with major labels to form a new record company. Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of BMG, made Robbins an offer, and after negotiations throughout 1995, Robbins Entertainment launched in early 1996 as a joint venture with BMG. In its first months, Robbins Entertainment scored hits. Its second single, \\"Jellyhead\\" by Crush, spent over 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. Freestyle artist Rockell debuted with \\"I Fell In Love,\\" which was a top 10 dance single and spent 18 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. At first, Robbins followed the tried-and-true model he had created at Profile Records, focusing on singles from a variety of genres, and compilation albums of licensed material. In 1996, Robbins launched the \\"Strip Jointz\\" series ‚Äî compilation albums of songs favored in \\"gentlemen's clubs.\\" The first Strip Jointz album sold over 100,000 copies. That series was followed by the Super Rare Disco and Dance Party and Trance Party compilations, which sold millions of albums for the label. = Focusing on dance = Non-dance artists did not prove to be profitable for Robbins Entertainment. Notably, rock artists H2SO4 and Meg Hentges were well-played on radio, but sales were anemic. After these disappointments, Cory Robbins decided in the year 2000 to focus exclusively on dance music. The following years were the most successful for the label. Robbins launched its Best of Trance and Best of House compilations, and in 2002, scored its first Billboard Top 10 pop hit with a remake of Bryan Adams' \\"Heaven\\" by DJ Sammy & Yanou featuring Do. Robbins' successes enabled him to buy back BMG's share of the label, and in 2002 took complete ownership of the company, retaining the distribution deal with BMG. =Robbins in the Digital Age= The ascent of digital music in the 21st Century was both bane and boon to Robbins Entertainment. On one hand, the implosion of record retailers virtually wiped out Robbins' compilation album business. On the other, dance music always thrived on singles sales, and never more so than in the digital age. Digital download services meant that Robbins' dance singles would never go out of print, and Robbins Entertainment's perennial favorites ‚Äî like sports anthem \\"Sandstorm\\" by Darude ‚Äî continued to sell by the thousands every week, for years after their initial release. Robbins spelled out his digital music philosophy in a 2002 interview with Radio & Records: > \\"The business as a whole should figure out a way to give the people what > they want. If people want to be able to download and make their own CDs of > any music they want, you have to do that. That's the only way it's going to > work. Otherwise, they‚Äôre going to continue to find a way to get it for free. > The position that we want people to buy CDs is wrong. Sure, I‚Äôd like people > to buy CDs, but if that's not what they want to buy, we have to figure out > how to give them what they want.\\" Robbins Entertainment continues to have pop and dance successes, as well as steady income from sync licensing. Among their latest hits are \\"Evacuate the Dancefloor\\" by Cascada (2009) and \\"Take Over Control\\" by Afrojack (2011).

The book, which was written in a screenplay form, is divided into three parts. In a recent interview with The Philippine Star, Ong explained that the book is \\"basically all about the ills of mass media that you wish would change. It‚Äôs mainly about, but not limited to, Pinoy movies. It‚Äôs the insanity and absurdity of our lives, our concept of entertainment, misplaced values, commercialism, and thoughtless existence as reflected through our abuse of art. It is laughable, but more deplorable\\". Synopsis The book is divided into three \\"short films\\", each one pokes fun to a particular genre. Bala Sa Bala, Kamao Sa Kamao, Satsat Sa Satsat The first film in the trilogy centers around Diego, an action star who wants to take revenge against a group of bad guys, also known as \\"Bandidos\\" (bandits), after they killed his parents, his wife, Ashley, and everyone who attended their wedding, just a few moments right after they get married at the beginning of the film. As the story unfolds, Diego, being an action star, gets into misadventures and finds himself in trouble-after-trouble. Unfortunately, Divina Tuazon, a famous actress and Diego's new found leading lady, was kidnapped by the Bandidos. Finally, in an abandoned warehouse (a setting where most of Pinoy action films' final scenes takes place), Diego tries to save Divina from the evil hands of Bandido's merciless and heartless leader named \\"Bos\\". The plot generally follows themes from classic Filipino action movies, as well as comedy films from early 1980s to 1990s. For example, Diego's sidekicks, Dodoy and Momoy uses slapstick from time to time, a type of comedy which was very popular in the country for the past decades. Shake, Shaker, Shakest A middle-class family was forced to enter and stay in a white haunted house for several days after being stranded in an unfamiliar place. The title is play on the Shake, Rattle & Roll film series and the plot is a ludicrous horror film. Asawa ni Marie A rags- to-riches story about Marie, a poor girl who has a confusing status in life and love. The plot is similar to Philippine dramas and soap operas, particularly Marimar.

The pantheon's burials have included Portuguese monarchs, Brazilian monarchs, a Romanian monarch, queen consorts of Portugal, and notable Infantes of Portugal, among others. History The pantheon in the early 20th century, before the Lisbon Regicide. The Pantheon was created under orders from Ferdinand II of Portugal, transforming the old refectory of the monastery into the burial place it is today. The majority of the tombs are located on the sides of the pantheon, and are simple marble boxes with spaces of four tombs. If the tomb is of a monarch, it has a crown engraved in gold on the side of the tomb and a crown placed on top of the entire set of tombs. The tombs in the center aisle of the pantheon are those belonging to Carlos I of Portugal, Lu√≠s Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal, Manuel II of Portugal and Queen Am√©lie of Orl√©ans; the two martyrs of the Lisbon Regicide, the last King of Portugal and the last Queen consort of Portugal.

She died in 1816, while the Royal Court was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and was initially laid to rest at the Ajuda Convent in Rio de Janeiro, but her remains were brought to Lisbon after the return of the Royal Family to Portugal. However, she was never buried in the Braganza Pantheon, and instead the Estrela Basilica was chosen as her resting place. *King Pedro IV, also known as Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, was initially buried in the Pantheon, but his remains were offered to Brazil in 1972 (to mark the 150th anniversary of the Brazilian Proclamation of Independence) and they were then laid to rest at the Imperial Crypt and Chapel within the Monument to the Independence of Brazil in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. His heart is interred in the Church of Our Lady of Lapa, in Porto, Portugal. * Queen Consort Maria Leopoldina of Austria, who was Queen Consort of Portugal during the brief reign of Pedro IV, is interred next to the body of her husband at the Monument to the Independence of Brazil in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. She never set foot in Portugal, but became a Portuguese Princess by marriage when she wed the then Prince Pedro, Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in 1817, while the Portuguese Royal Court was in Rio de Janeiro. She subsequently remained in Brazil with her husband, and became Empress Consort of Brazil when Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil and was acclaimed as Emperor Pedro I. When Pedro briefly held the Portuguese Crown as King Pedro IV from March to May, 1826, Empress Maria Leopoldina became Queen Consort of Portugal. She died in December 1826, and, before her remains were transferred to the Imperial Crypt and Chapel at the Monument to the Independence of Brazil in 1972, she was initially buried at the Imperial Mausoleum of St. Anthony's Convent in Rio de Janeiro. *Queen Consort Maria Pia, consort of King Lu√≠s I of Portugal, is buried in the Pantheon of the House of Savoy in the Basilica of Superga in Turin, Italy. *Princess Augusta Victoria of Hohenzollern, consort of King Manuel II of Portugal (the couple wed after his deposition and the abolition of the Monarchy), is buried at Langenstein Castle, owned by the family of her second husband (Count Robert Douglas). Former burials *Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, a member of the House of Braganza and son of King Pedro IV, was buried in the Pantheon in 1891 and remained there until 1921 when his body was repatriated to Brazil and reburied at the Imperial Crypt of the Cathedral of St. Peter of Alcantara in Petr√≥polis. After the military coup d'√©tat that proclaimed Brazil a Republic on 15 November 1889 the Brazilian Imperial Family was sent into exile, and were received and given protection by their Braganza cousins who still reigned in Portugal. After the death of his wife, Empress Teresa Cristina, on 28 December 1889, Pedro II decided to move to France, and settled in Paris, where he died on 5 December 1891. After a State Funeral hosted by the French authorities at the Church of St. Mary Magdalen, his body was moved by train to Portugal, and was solemnly buried at the Braganza Pantheon. After the 1920 revocation of the decree that banished the Imperial Family from Brazil, an Imperial Crypt was built at Petr√≥polis Cathedral, and a Brazilian State Funeral for the former Emperor was finally held in 1921, on the occasion of the reburial of his remains there. * Empress Teresa Cristina of Brazil, wife of the deposed Brazilian Emperor Pedro II and therefore a member of the House of Braganza by marriage, was laid to rest in the Pantheon from her death in December 1889 (shortly after the coup d'√©tat that proclaimed Brazil a Republic and sent the Imperial Family into exile), until 1921, when her remains were returned to Brazil together with those of her husband, and were laid to rest at the Imperial Crypt in the Cathedral of St. Peter of Alcantara in Petr√≥polis. * Empress Am√©lia of Brazil, another member of the House of Braganza by marriage, second wife of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil (Pedro had reigned as King Pedro IV of Portugal but the couple wed after his abdication of the Portuguese Crown) and Duchess of Braganza (as wife and later as widow of the Duke of Braganza, the title that her husband assumed after his abdication of the Brazilian Crown), remained in Portugal during her widowhood and was buried in the Pantheon from her death in 1873 until 1982, when her remains were ceded to Brazil and transferred to the Imperial Crypt and Chapel at the Monument to the Independence of Brazil in S√£o Paulo. *Princess Maria Am√©lia of Brazil, also a member of the House of Braganza, King Pedro IV's only child from his second marriage, conceived after his abdication of the Portuguese Crown, and born in Europe after his abdication of the Brazilian Crown, was buried in the Pantheon from her moving from Madeira a few months after her death in 1853 until 1982, when her remains were ceded to Brazil and transferred to the Imperial Mausoleum at St. Anthony's Convent in Rio de Janeiro, where they are buried alongside the remains of several other princes and princesses descended from the Emperors of Brazil. *King Carol II of Romania, who died in Portugal while in exile, and his wife Magda Lupescu (the couple were married after his abdication of the Romanian Crown) were buried in the pantheon before the return of their bodies to Romania in 2003. They are now buried in the Orthodox Cathedral of Curtea de Arge»ô, alongside other Romanian royals.

He was the Florida State Treasurer from 1928 to 1941. Born in Terrell County, Georgia, he moved to Florida by wagon in 1881. When he arrived, he helped establish citrus groves with his family along with establishing a phosphate mine and working in local government with his brother, Charles. He married Luella Pugh in 1895 and moved to Tallahassee, Florida, in 1897, taking up the position of the first \\"financial agent\\" of the state government. His title was later, in 1901, changed to \\"State Auditor\\". He was appointed as state treasurer for the first time in 1903 and to comptroller in 1912 when the incumbent, A. C. Croom, died. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1916, defeated by Sidney Johnston Catts and returned to farming and business until he was appointed director of a local hospital in 1921. He was appointed to his former position as auditor general in 1927 but, in the following year, John Christian Luning, the incumbent state treasurer, died and Knott was re- appointed to that position, serving until his retirement at age 78 in 1941. He is the longest served state treasurer in the state's history, serving under 11 governors. He died at the age of 101 after collapsing at his home in 1965 and his body lay in state at the Florida State Capitol to allow the public to pay their respects.

Abdur-Razzaq (December 20, 1931 ‚Äì November 21, 2014) was an African-American activist and Muslim known for being one of Malcolm X's most trusted associates. Born James Monroe King Warden, he was known as James 67X when he belonged to the Nation of Islam and James Shabazz in the years after he left the organization. Early life James Monroe King Warden was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in the impoverished Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. He attended the Bronx High School of Science, from which he graduated with honors. He enrolled in the City College of New York but transferred to Lincoln University in Chester County, Pennsylvania, after a year. He soon left that school as well to join the Army. Following his discharge, he returned to Lincoln and graduated with honors in English in 1958. He received a master's degree from Columbia University. His work In 1958, Warden joined the Nation of Islam at Mosque No. 7, on 102 West 116th Street in New York City, under Minister Malcolm X. As was the custom among Nation of Islam members, he abandoned the surname of Warden as a vestige of chattel slavery and became the 67th James in Mosque No. 7. By 1960, he had been promoted to lieutenant in the Fruit of Islam, subordinate to Captain Joseph X. Gravitt (later known as Yusuf Shah). Subsequently, he was appointed circulation manager for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut of Muhammad Speaks, and answered directly to Malcolm X. After the split between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X formed Muslim Mosque, Inc. and appointed James, then still known as James 67X, secretary of the organization, as well as captain of the men. Based on Malcolm X's instruction, he took the name James Shabazz. Brother James, as he was sometimes referred, was also responsible for the formation of the Organization of Afro-American Unity, a secular organization that Malcolm X had also formed, patterned after Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's Organisation of African Unity, and through which Malcolm X intended to charge the United States with violating the human rights of its chattel slave descendants. Shabazz was a constant and willing aide to Malcolm X, in his capacity as head of Muslim Mosque, Inc. and as head of the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He remained with, and vigorously assisted Malcolm X until the leader's murder on February 21, 1965. Post-Malcolm X days Abdur-Razzaq spent the years following Malcolm X's murder raising a family and co-founding Al-Karim School (which would later become Brooklyn's famed Cush Campus Schools) with Ora Abdur-Razzaq. He later moved to Guyana, where he worked as a farmer. Returning to the U.S. in 1988, he earned a nursing degree, and he worked in as a nurse until his retirement in 2004. In his later years, Abdur-Razzaq's work as staff consultant for the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture was invaluable in cataloging rare photographs, letters and accounts of Malcolm X's life and times. Furthermore, his expertise was widely solicited by journalists, authors, film makers and educators. In addition to his contributions to a wide array of published works, such as Bruce Perry's Malcolm X: The Last Speeches, Abdur-Razzaq was featured in several television interviews and films, including Malcolm X: Make It Plain and Gil Noble's Like It Is. The DVD version of Jack Baxter's documentary Brother Minister: The Assassination of Malcolm X includes an \\"Exclusive Interview with Abdullah Abdur-Razzaq, Malcolm X's closest associate\\". Final years and death In April 2013, Abdur-Razzaq returned to Lincoln University to speak about his memories and experiences working with Malcolm X. Battling leukemia, Abdur-Razzaq was admitted to Harlem Hospital in late 2014. After several weeks, he was transferred to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he died on November 21, 2014, at the age of 82. He is survived by children, grandchildren, and a large extended family.

Hackett is a Canadian university professor and researcher. He has been a professor and researcher at the School of Communication in Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada since 1984. His main areas of research include media activism, political communication and news analysis. Since 1993, he has co-directed NewsWatch Canada , a news media monitoring project based at Simon Fraser University. He is also on the editorial board of several journals. He has conducted numerous media interviews and public talks, written policy briefs, and has helped to found several community-based media action and education initiatives, including Vancouver's annual Media Democracy Days. His work has been translated into Chinese, Serbian and Ukrainian. Research contributions and interests Hackett's research in journalism studies, news objectivity and normative paradigms centers around critiquing the existing structures of journalism objectivity with a focus on its political and ideological implications in a globalized and networked digital age. The research contributes to the analysis of emerging paradigms that challenge what he and his co-author coined as \\"the regime of objectivity\\" in North American journalism. His work in media democratization, media activism, social movement theory, communication rights and democratic communication models focuses more on citizen efforts to make media institutions more accountable and diverse, in alliance with social movements that aim to redistribute social, economic and political power and capital. In particular, Hackett has been concerned with media democratization as a rising social movement, the subject of his internationally circulated book with William K. Carroll, Remaking Media. In conjunction with WACC and OpenMedia.ca, he has also researched Canadian activists‚Äô views of communication policy in the Canadian context. He has also contributed to news analysis in peace and war; peace journalism; media frames; content and textual analysis and news determinants. With Donald Gutstein, and at the invitation of the Canadian Association of Journalists, Hackett initiated NewsWatch Canada in 1993; initially a Canadian version of Project Censored, which identifies top stories missed each year by the corporate media in the US, NewsWatch has evolved into an occasional survey of Canadian news media coverage of selected issues. His research on media frames and the influences on news content took an international turn with his work on peace journalism and international news reporting of and in relation to conflict. http://www.toda.org/publications/journals.html Peace journalism : the state of the art / Dov Shinar & Wilhelm Kempf (eds.)

After a ten-year transition period starting 1879, usage of legacy units were outlawed by the beginning of 1889. History On Andr√© Oscar Wallenberg suggested to the Swedish parliament that the metric system should be implemented in Sweden. After the suggestion was approved in the Swedish Parliament , work started to draft a law for metrication. After about one year of drafts, debates and amendments, the law was approved . The first part of the law stated that the meter was the basis for measurement of length and the kilogram the basis for measurement of weight. It also stated the prefixes and decimal relation to be used. During the debates, the length of the transition period, first planned until 1883, and the fact that Sweden already had changed to a decimal based measurement system in 1855 were discussed. The law also defined the ny mil as exactly meter, from the former meter Swedish mile. The law stated that the introduction should take place progressively from 1879 to 1888, and that the metric system should be used exclusively from the beginning of 1889. Late adoptions *Lumber are sold in metric units, with their width and thickness given in millimetres. Sawn timber are normally available by width and thickness in multiples of 25 millimeter, for example 50 √ó 100 mm. This is inherited from the former practice of using the inch. Planned timber are normally sold in multiples of 25 mm minus 5 mm for planing, for example 45 √ó 95 mm. Giving the measurements in inches was still common in the late 20th century, about 100 years after the metric system was implemented, but have since become less common. Current exceptions *In everyday language, television sets and displays of any kind are often referred to in their diagonal measured in inches. In formal specifications the metric size is always given. *Pipes are sold in metric length, but their diameter are measured in both inches (defined as 25 mm) and in millimetres. *Textile is normally sold in metres but the thread count is in threads per square inch. *The price of gold, is quoted in US dollars per ounce. *McDonald's sells its Quarter Pounder with cheese as Quarter Pounder Cheese or QP Cheese *The number of teeth on a saw is measured in teeth per inch (TPI) *Hammers are measured in millimetres but weighed in ounces. *Watering hoses' length are measured in metres, but the diameter is measured in inches. *Sailing yachts are measured in feet. *Distances larger than 10 to 20 kilometres are usually given in mil, a metric successor of the slightly longer Swedish mile, redefined in 1876 as 10 kilometres. However, on road signs kilometre is used. *Traditionally, fuel consumption of cars was usually given in litres per mil. Since joining the European Union, the measure litres per 100 kilometre is legally required and more common in official material and advertising. In everyday use, litres per mil is still common. In some contexts, such as calculating cost of ownership of a vehicle (\\"milkostnad\\", i.e. cost per mil) and reimbursement for using a privately owned vehicle instead of a company car (\\"milers√§ttning\\"), the mil is even still used in legal texts, in spite of officially not being a legal unit of length. *World oil price is quoted in US dollars per Barrels. *The metric yardstick is commonly called tumstock (tum is the Swedish word for inch), instead of meterstock or m√•ttstock. It was during the 20th century usually graded in (English) inches and centimetres, but increasingly only in centimetres. *The power of fuel powered engines is given in horsepower instead of watts, but the power of electrical engines is given in watts.

History The Gurudwara Dukh Nivaran Sahib is situated in what used to be the village of Lehal, now Patiala city. According to local tradition, supported by an old handwritten document preserved in the Gurudwara, Bhag Ram, a Jhivar of Lehal, waited upon Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji during his sojourn at Saifabad (now Bahadurgarh) and made a request that he might be pleased to visit and bless his village so that its in inhabitants could be rid of a serious and mysterious sickness which had seen their bane for a long time. The Guru visited Lehal on Magh Sudi 5, Samat 1728 Bikrami being 24 January 1672 and stayed under a banyan tree of a pond. The sickness in the village subsided. The side where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as Dukh Nivaran, literally meaning eradicator of suffering. The Gurudwara when completed passed under the administrative control of the Patiala state government. But it eventually transferred to the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee. Geography Patiala is one of the twenty districts of Punjab, India. Patiala District lies between 29 49‚Äô and 30 47‚Äô north latitude, 75 58‚Äô and 76 54' east longitude, in the southeast part of the state. It is located in Payal Tehsil of Ludhiana district in Punjab, India, about 18 kilometres away from sub-district headquarter of Payal and 38 kilometres from the district headquarter of Ludhiana.
