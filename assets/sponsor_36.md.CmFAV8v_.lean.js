For most of their career, the group consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and nine EPs over the course of their decade- long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour, and will perform two 30th anniversary shows in 2021. Though only briefly brushing the mainstream with the single \\"Cut Your Hair\\" in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major label as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to independent labels throughout their career and have often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the '90s. Some prominent music critics, such as Robert Christgau and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, called them the best band of the 1990s. In their career, they also achieved a significant cult following.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas; Phares, Heather. [ \\"Pavement biography\\"], AllMusic. Retrieved on March 26, 2009.From The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (Simon & Schuster, 2001) History = Slanted and Enchanted: 1989‚Äì1992 = Pavement formed in Stockton, California in 1989 as a studio project of guitarists and vocalists Stephen Malkmus & Scott Kannberg, known originally only as \\"S.M.\\" and \\"Spiral Stairs\\". Their debut EPs were extremely lo-fi releases titled Slay Tracks: 1933‚Äì1969, Demolition Plot J-7, and Perfect Sound Forever. They were recorded at Louder Than You Think, the home studio of Stockton local and former hippie Gary Young who also played drums on the recordings. Upon first hearing the duo's songs, Young was quoted as saying, \\"this Malkmus idiot is a complete songwriting genius.\\"Sullivan, James. \\"Pavement Gear Up\\". Synthesis.net. February 27, 1997. Retrieved on March 26, 2009. During this time the band was often compared to English rock band The Fall, however Kannberg stated in a 1992 interview that he preferred Minneapolis rock band The Replacements. The Fall's Mark E. Smith claimed that Pavement were a \\"rip-off\\" of his bandPerry, Andrew. \\"Alright?\\". Select. May 1993. and that they didn't \\"have an original idea in their heads\\",Herrington, Tony. \\"Mark E. Smith: Interview\\". The Wire. September 1996. although other members of The Fall have been more positive about the band.Atwal, Sandy. \\"Fall in a Hole\\". Imprint. September 30, 1994. After the release of Slay Tracks, a new drummer, Jason Turner, was drafted to replace Young both live and in the studio. However, after just one tour and a handful of recording sessions, when it became apparent that the percussionist and Malkmus did not get along well, Turner was ousted and Young reinstated.Jovanovic (2004), p.78‚Äì82. Malkmus later described Turner as \\"this depressed guy who might assassinate me one day... He's very competitive.\\"Tape Op: The Book About Creative Music Recording, edited by Larry Crane. Interviews with Stephen Malkmus and Gary Young, pp. 68‚Äì78 Around the same time, Bob Nastanovich was incorporated into the live Pavement band as an auxiliary percussionist. Malkmus had been roommates with Nastanovich in New York City, and had told him, \\"You could be our drummer if we ever played.\\" Around 1992 Pavement became a full-time band, with the addition of bassist Mark Ibold, who had been one of the band's earliest fans, with Malkmus, Kannberg, Young and Nastanovich rounding out the lineup. Their debut album, Slanted and Enchanted, was released commercially in 1992 after copies had been circulated on cassette tape for nearly a year. Though the percussive influence of The Fall was still pervasive, as was that of English post-punk band Swell Maps, many of the songs also exhibited a strong sense of melody. Since its release Slanted and Enchanted has appeared on many critics' best-of lists and is frequently cited as being among the most influential indie rock albums of the 1990s. It is listed on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Later the same year, the band released the EP Watery, Domestic. =Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: 1993‚Äì1994= During the Slanted & Enchanted tour, Gary Young's eccentric behavior increased, and he would stage incidents such as handing out cabbage and mashed potatoes to fans at the door of the venue, doing handstands, drunkenly falling off his drum stool, and running around the venue while the rest of the band was playing. The band only understood how severe Young's drinking problem was after Pavement's first few tours. Malkmus later told Tape Op, \\"We knew that he was like a hippie and kinda flaky, but we didn't know he had such a bad drinking problem. We found out on that tour, because he really got sick from being nervous... That's why I let Bob be in the band...'Keep the beat going if Gary passes out.'\\" In 1993, Malkmus attempted to record some new songs at Young's studio with unsuccessful results. The singer later said, \\"We kind of wanted to not record with him anymore, but we were too nice to fire people or even really talk about it... We tried to record there, but it wasn't sounding good and he didn't have his studio ready and he was also in a drinking funk.\\" At the conclusion of a 1993 tour of Australia, Japan, and Europe, the group held a meeting in a hotel room in Copenhagen during which Malkmus, Kannberg and Ibold remained silent while Nastanovich (Young's best friend at the time) argued with the drummer and informed him that his antics were unnecessary. Young ultimately agreed to leave the band. He was replaced by Steve West, who had been a fellow museum security guard at the Whitney Museum of American Art along with Malkmus and David Berman.Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain: LA's Desert Origin's CD. Liner notes by Spiral Stairs West's debut performance was in 1993 at a Drag City festival in Chicago. Also that same year, the band contributed to the AIDS-Benefit Album No Alternative produced by the Red Hot Organization with their song \\"Unseen Power of the Picket Fence\\". Pavement's second album Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain was released in 1994. The record was more indebted to the classic rock tradition than their debut. The single \\"Cut Your Hair\\" was the band's closest brush with the mainstream, and briefly enjoyed airplay on alternative rock radio and MTV. Pavement performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The video also aired on \\"Career Day\\", a season five episode of Beavis and Butt-head, who termed it \\"buttwipe music\\" and also wanted the band to \\"try harder.\\" The lyrics from another single from the album, \\"Range Life\\", criticized alternative rock stars The Smashing Pumpkins and the Stone Temple Pilots. Malkmus has insisted over the years that the line is meant to be light-hearted and is sung from the point of view of the aging hippie character in the song. Later live versions of the track had the singer substituting \\"The Spice Girls\\", \\"Counting Crows\\", or others for \\"Stone Temple Pilots\\". In response Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan threatened to drop his band from their slot headlining the 1994 Lollapalooza Festival if Pavement was allowed to play. Corgan and Malkmus would trade barbs through the press for several years afterwards.\\"Rivalries great fodder for entertainment in music industry\\". Daily Bruin, April 27, 2003. Like its predecessor, the album received widespread acclaim, including being listed on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time =Wowee Zowee and Brighten the Corners: 1995‚Äì1997= The next album, Wowee Zowee, recorded in Memphis and released April 11, 1995, covered a wide range of styles including punk, country and balladry across its 18 tracks, which often avoided conventional song structures. On the Slow Century DVD, Malkmus attributed his odd choice of singles to his marijuana smoking, stating that \\"I was smoking a lot of grass back then but to me they sounded like hits.\\" Although Malkmus has said in recent interviews that the album is the last \\"classic Pavement record,\\" Kannberg has voiced regrets about Wowee Zowee. \\"We made some mistakes on that record... we were kind of pressured into putting out a record a little faster than we were ready to. I mean, I'm totally into the record. It's just if we had another six months to think about it, it would've been much different.\\" During the tour for the album, Nastanovich stated on the Slow Century DVD, the band would often not work out a setlist before shows, opting for drug and alcohol fueled jams over hit singles. Some of these shows were held during the 1995 Lollapallooza festival, where the incoherent performances received a hostile reaction from many audiences. Footage from Slow Century shows the band being pelted with mud and rocks. The band then left the stage immediately and dubbed themselves \\"The Band That Ruined Lollapallooza.\\" Wowee Zowee was followed up by the EP Pacific Trim, which was recorded with only Malkmus and drummers Nastanovich and Steve West. Their studio time was originally reserved for a Silver Jews recording, but frontman David Berman walked out in frustration and the trio decided not to waste prepaid recording time. Brighten the Corners was released in 1997; produced by Mitch Easter it is a shorter, more conventional record than the previous album. Malkmus said on the Slow Century DVD that the album was an attempt to show audiences that Pavement had more mainstream and classic rock influences than it had previously portrayed. The album contained two of the band's best known singles in \\"Stereo\\" and \\"Shady Lane\\". It was the only Pavement album to include a lyric sheet except Slanted and Enchanted and sold better than its predecessors. Despite increased success, the band continued to fragment, with its members focusing more on other musical projects or on raising families. =Terror Twilight and breakup: 1999‚Äì2000= In 1999, the band began work on its final album, Terror Twilight. Bob Nastanovich came up with the title, and has revealed the meaning of it in several interviews: \\"Twilight Terror is the short span between sunset and dusk; this is considered the most dangerous time in traffic, because half of the people switch on the headlights, and the other half doesn't. It's when most accidents happen.\\" During an interview on the Slow Century documentary DVD, he said that the band was having trouble coming up with names for the record until he put forth Terror Twilight. One of the final contenders was Farewell Horizontal (also the name of a 1989 science fiction novel by K. W. Jeter), and Nastanovich said, \\"There was no way I was going to be on the Farewell Horizontal tour for the next year.\\" The band originally planned to self-produce Terror Twilight, renting out Jackpot! Studios in Portland, Oregon. The group stalled though, with Malkmus, Ibold, Nastanovich and Jackpot! employee and future Jicks bassist Joanna Bolme usually opting to play Scrabble over getting any sort of work accomplished.Jovanovic (2004), p.177. Kannberg was especially frustrated over the sessions, particularly at Malkmus' refusal to include any of Kannberg's songs on the album. Fan favorite \\"For Sale: The Preston School of Industry\\" and one other song penned by the guitarist were briefly worked on during the sessions, but eventually abandoned. At the end of the initial two-week session, very little had been accomplished and it was decided that a producer should be brought in to assist them. Nigel Godrich, best known for his work with Radiohead and Beck, was hired to produce the album.\\"PAVEMENT: THE CRACKS OF THEIR ASPHALT\\". Chart Attack, June 22, 1999. Interview By Stuart Berman The group first attempted to record in Sonic Youth's lower Manhattan studio, which Godrich took a dislike to as it was within ear-shot of several practice spaces, and also set up more like a home studio.Jovanovic (2004), p.179-180. Godrich eventually convinced the band to move to a more \\"proper\\" 24-track studio, where he had previously worked on albums by the Beastie Boys and R.E.M. Though the producer took an immediate shine to Malkmus, Kannberg and Nastanovich were wary of him. Nastanovich believes that though Godrich \\"took on a pretty substantial challenge and did a good job,\\" that he \\"focused his attention on Stephen\\" and produced them \\"in a way that just sort of had more disregard for the rest of us.\\"Jovanovic (2004), p.181. Nastanovich also later recalled an awkward incident where it became apparent that the producer didn't know the auxiliary percussionist's name. Kannberg, still disillusioned over his songs being rejected by Malkmus, said of Terror Twilight: \\"It was not fun to do that record from the very beginning. It was the hardest record to make.\\" Malkmus wrote the entirety of the record, and the recording of the music only featured minor contributions from the rest of the band. The group released one last EP, titled Major Leagues. It features three Malkmus songs, two original Spiral Stairs songs and two covers, \\"The Killing Moon\\" by Echo & the Bunnymen and \\"The Classical\\" by The Fall. Pavement embarked on a six-month world tour in support of the album, during which time relationships within the group frayed, especially between Malkmus and the other members of the band. Steve West later recalled times on the tour bus where Malkmus would put his coat over his head, refuse to speak to anyone, and call himself \\"The Little Bitch\\". Critics noted that their setlist had started to include a number of their early songs, much like a band playing their greatest hits on a farewell tour. Malkmus's attitude continued to deteriorate as the tour wore on, finally coming to a head during their slot at the 1999 Coachella Festival. During the concert, Malkmus refused (or possibly was unable, due to illness) to sing, effectively turning their set into a mostly instrumental one. Nastanovich called a band meeting after the show, and Malkmus finally confided to his bandmates: \\"I just don't want to do this anymore.\\"Jovanovic (2004), p.187. The group's final concert together was at Brixton Academy in London on November 20, 1999.\\"Cracks in the Pavement ‚Äì Reports elsewhere claimed that we were making it all up\\". NME. December 1, 1999. Retrieved on March 27, 2009. During the concert, Malkmus had a pair of handcuffs attached to his microphone stand, and at one point told that audience, \\"These symbolize what it's like being in a band all these years.\\"\\"Cracks in the Pavement ‚Äì Malkmus and co look like they'll go separate ways\\". NME. December 1, 1999. Retrieved on March 27, 2009. After the concert, he confirmed to people at the after-party that Pavement was now done \\"for the foreseeable future.\\" About two weeks later, a spokesperson for Domino records told NME: \\"Pavement are retiring for the foreseeable future to: 1. Start families 2. Sail around the world 3. Get into the computer industry 4. Dance 5. Get some attention.\\" In the summer of 2000, Malkmus called Kannberg and told him, \\"You need to change the website to say we aren't a band anymore. People keep asking me if we're breaking up and you know we're not a band anymore, right?\\"Jovanovic (2004), p.194. Kannberg told Malkmus that he needed to call the other members of the band to inform them that the band was finally breaking up, but Malkmus refused and Kannberg was left with the task of informing them. Steve West later admitted that he never received any official call about the breakup from anyone in the band, and discovered that Pavement had dissolved via the internet. Nastanovich later commented that \\"There was too much exhaustion for heavy emotion.\\" =Reunion: 2010= Stephen Malkmus in concert with Pavement in 2010. On September 15, 2009, Brooklyn Vegan reported that Pavement were scheduled to perform multiple benefit show dates in New York City's Central Park from September 21, 2010.BV. (September 15, 2009). \\"the Pavement reunion is on ‚Äì multiple nights @ Central Park Summerstage in 2010 + a tour? + Coachella? + ATP?\\". Brooklyn Vegan. Official statements by the band, label, venue and promoter were released on September 17, 2009 confirming the reunion. The announcement included one concert in Central Park and the promise of a tour, but said that the reunion may only be a one-off event. It said, \\"Please be advised this tour is not a prelude to additional jaunts and/or a permanent reunion.\\" Tickets for the first Central Park concert sold out in two minutes,\\"Pavement Add Reunion Shows\\". Pitchfork Media. September 18, 2009. leading to the announcement of three more shows at the same venue. The band since confirmed a world-wide tour which started in Auckland, New Zealand on March 1 at the Auckland Town Hall, before heading on to Australia then heading to the UK, including the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Minehead, Somerset (May 14 ‚Äì 16) and several European shows. They also performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2010, the Sasquatch! and Primavera Sound Festivals in May, the Toronto Island Concert in June with Broken Social Scene, Band Of Horses, and others, Open'er Festival, Roskilde Festival and Les Ardentes and Pitchfork Music Festival in July. The band released a \\"best-of\\" compilation album in March 2010, entitled Quarantine the Past: The Best of Pavement. On June 24, 2010, Pavement performed at the Bob Hope Theatre in Stockton, their first-ever hometown show. Original drummer Gary Young joined the band for an encore, playing three songs from Slanted and Enchanted. Young also joined the band during six songs the next night at The Greek Theater in Berkeley. In September 2010, Pavement appeared on The Colbert Report and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. After concluding their proper US tour at the Hollywood Bowl on September 30, the band played the following night in Las Vegas at the Palms Casino as a part of the Matador At 21 festival.NME article: \\"Pavement drop hint about their future during Las Vegas gig\\". During their set, Scott Kannberg kicked his monitor and smashed his guitar into his amp in frustration of not being able to hear himself while performing. NME noted the band had an \\"icy atmosphere onstage\\". The band honored a further two South American show commitments in November 2010. =Second reunion: 2021= Scott Kannberg joined Stephen Malkmus and The Jicks onstage at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles on March 28, 2014, for an encore performance of the Pavement song \\"Stereo.\\" On October 1 and 2, 2016 Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks performed at Spiral Stairs' 50th birthday celebration at The Chapel in San Francisco. On the first night Kannberg joined Malkmus and The Jicks onstage for four songs. The following night Kannberg played three more songs with the group, joined by Gary Young on the final two. On June 1, 2019, Pavement announced that they would be reuniting to perform two 30th anniversary shows at the 2020 Primavera Sound festivals in Barcelona and Porto, and were scheduled to be the band's only performances that year. Due to logistical issues resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival was cancelled, and their performances were rescheduled and announced as part of Primavera Sound's June 2021 lineup.  Musical style  Pavement is considered to be one of the bands to have invented the modern \\"indie\\" sound and was a large presence in \\"slacker culture,\\" a subculture most prevalent during the 1990s. The band was also noted for Malkmus' humorous and often cryptic lyrical themes which was a key factor in gaining their cult following. Malkmus rarely wrote ballads or love songs and only a small portion of their discography contained personal reflections or similar lyrical themes, most satirical or laced with sarcasm. Pavement was also noted for having no designated rhythm and lead guitar player. Malkmus and Kannberg switched roles frequently although Malkmus played lead for the majority of their career. The band was also noted for their use of a foil, or a 'hype-man' usually present in hip hop groups. Bob Nastanovich filled the role although he has detested the term himself. Nastanovich also served as a second drummer during their live performances and served as lead vocalist on select songs that required screaming to prevent strain on Malkmus' voice. Other media In 2002, Slow Century, a documentary by Lance Bangs coupled with all of the band's music videos, was released as a 2 DVD set. Included was extensive footage, both professionally shot and taped by fans on camcorders, from the band's earliest shows in 1989 forward. The three final songs from the band's final concert (\\"Stop Breathin'\\", \\"Conduit for Sale\\" and \\"Here\\") are presented at the end of the documentary. Also on the DVD is a hidden easter egg clip from the same show, wherein Malkmus talks about how the handcuffs attached to his microphone stand \\"represent what it's like being in a band all these years.\\" A bonus disc with a complete concert in Seattle, Washington, from the early part of the Terror Twilight tour was included on the second disc, as well as several songs from their penultimate show. 2004 saw the publication of Perfect Sound Forever: The Story of Pavement, a biography on the band written by Rob Jovanovic. Reviews for the book were mixed, with some saying that it contained much of the same information as the Slow Century DVD and expanded very little on it, while others called it a \\"fond retrospection\\". Appearances The band appeared in a 1997 episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast, titled \\"Pavement\\", where they were mistaken for The Beatles and played two songs done exclusively for the show. These songs were later included on the deluxe re-issue of Brighten the Corners.

In this respect, it differed from the epicyclic and eccentric models with multiple centers, which were used by Ptolemy and other mathematical astronomers until the time of Copernicus. Origins of the concept of concentric spheres Eudoxus of Cnidus was the first astronomer to develop the concept of concentric spheres. He was originally a student at Plato's academy and is believed to have been influenced by the cosmological speculations of Plato and Pythagoras.\\"Eudoxus of Cnidus.\\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. Vol. 4. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008. 465‚Äì467. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 2 June 2014. He came up with the idea of homocentric spheres in order to explain the perceived inconsistent motions of the planets and to develop a uniform model for accurately calculating the movement of celestial objects. None of his books have survived to the modern day and everything we know about his cosmological theories comes from the works of Aristotle and Simplicius. According to these works, Eudoxus‚Äô model had twenty-seven homocentric spheres with each sphere explaining a type of observable motion for each celestial object. Eudoxus assigns one sphere for the fixed stars which is supposed to explain their daily movement. He assigns three spheres to both the sun and the moon with the first sphere moving in the same manner as the sphere of the fixed stars. The second sphere explains the movement of the sun and the moon on the ecliptic plane. The third sphere was supposed to move on a ‚Äúlatitudinally inclined‚Äù circle and explain the latitudinal motion of the sun and the moon in the cosmos. Four spheres were assigned to Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn which were the only known planets at that time. The first and second spheres of the planets moved exactly like the first two spheres of the sun and the moon. According to Simplicius, the third and fourth sphere of the planets were supposed to move in a way that created a curve known as a hippopede. The hippopede was a way to try and explain the retrograde motions of planets. Many historians of science, such as Michael J. Crowe, have argued that Eudoxus did not consider his system of concentric spheres to be a real representation of the universe but thought it was merely a mathematical model for calculating planetary motion. Later additions to Eudoxus' model Callippus, a contemporary of Eudoxus, attempted to improve his system by increasing the total number of homocentric spheres. He added two additional spheres for the sun and the moon as well as one additional sphere for Mars, Mercury, and Venus. These additional spheres were supposed to fix some of the calculation problems in Eudoxus‚Äô original system. Callippus‚Äô system was able to better predict the motions of certain celestial objects but his system still had many problems and was not able to account for many astronomical observations. Aristotle developed his own system of concentric spheres in Metaphysics and De Caelo (On the Heavens). He thought that both Eudoxus and Callippus had too few spheres within their models and added more spheres onto Callippus‚Äô system. He added three spheres to Jupiter and Mars as well as four spheres to Venus, Mercury, the sun, and the moon for a total of fifty-five spheres. He later doubted the accuracy of his results and stated that he believed there were either forty seven or forty nine concentric spheres. Historians are unsure about how many spheres Aristotle thought there were in the cosmos with theories ranging from 43 to 55. Unlike Eudoxus, Aristotle believed that his system represented an actual model of the cosmos.

M. Rader, \\"Discrete Fourier transforms when the number of data samples is prime,\\" Proc. IEEE 56, 1107‚Äì1108 (1968). named for Charles M. Rader of MIT Lincoln Laboratory, is a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of prime sizes by re-expressing the DFT as a cyclic convolution (the other algorithm for FFTs of prime sizes, Bluestein's algorithm, also works by rewriting the DFT as a convolution). Since Rader's algorithm only depends upon the periodicity of the DFT kernel, it is directly applicable to any other transform (of prime order) with a similar property, such as a number-theoretic transform or the discrete Hartley transform. The algorithm can be modified to gain a factor of two savings for the case of DFTs of real data, using a slightly modified re- indexing/permutation to obtain two half-size cyclic convolutions of real data;S. Chu and C. Burrus, \\"A prime factor FTT [sic] algorithm using distributed arithmetic,\\" IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 30 (2), 217-227 (1982). an alternative adaptation for DFTs of real data uses the discrete Hartley transform.Matteo Frigo and Steven G.

Winograd, \\"On Computing the Discrete Fourier Transform\\", Proc. National Academy of Sciences USA, 73(4), 1005-1006 (1976).S. Winograd, \\"On Computing the Discrete Fourier Transform\\", Mathematics of Computation, 32(141), 175-199 (1978). and today Rader's algorithm is sometimes described as a special case of Winograd's FFT algorithm, also called the multiplicative Fourier transform algorithm (Tolimieri et al., 1997),R. Tolimieri, M. An, and C.Lu, Algorithms for Discrete Fourier Transform and Convolution, Springer- Verlag, 2nd ed., 1997. which applies to an even larger class of sizes. However, for composite sizes such as prime powers, the Cooley‚ÄìTukey FFT algorithm is much simpler and more practical to implement, so Rader's algorithm is typically only used for large-prime base cases of Cooley‚ÄìTukey's recursive decomposition of the DFT. Algorithm Visual representation of DFT matrix in Rader's FFT algorithm, The array consists of colored clocks represent DFT matrix of size 11. By permuting rows and columns using a sequence generated by the primitive root of 11 (which is 2) except the 1st row and column, the original DFT matrix becomes a circulant matrix. Multiplying a circulant matrix to a data sequence is equivalent to the cyclic convolution. This relation is an example of the fact that multiplicative group is cyclic: (\\\\mathbb Z/p\\\\mathbb Z)^\\\\times \\\\cong C_{p-1}. : X_k = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N} nk } \\\\qquad k = 0,\\\\dots,N-1. If N is a prime number, then the set of non-zero indices n = 1,...,N-1 forms a group under multiplication modulo N. One consequence of the number theory of such groups is that there exists a generator of the group (sometimes called a primitive root, which can be found quickly by exhaustive search or slightly better algorithmsDonald E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, vol. 2: Seminumerical Algorithms, 3rd edition, section 4.5.4, p. 391 (Addison‚ÄìWesley, 1998).), an integer g such that n = gq (mod N) for any non-zero index n and for a unique q in 0,...,N-2 (forming a bijection from q to non-zero n). Similarly k = g-p (mod N) for any non-zero index k and for a unique p in 0,...,N-2, where the negative exponent denotes the multiplicative inverse of gp modulo N. That means that we can rewrite the DFT using these new indices p and q as: : X_0 = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n, : X_{g^{-p}} = x_0 + \\\\sum_{q=0}^{N-2} x_{g^q} e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N} g^{-(p-q)} } \\\\qquad p = 0,\\\\dots,N-2. (Recall that xn and Xk are implicitly periodic in N, and also that e2œÄi=1. Thus, all indices and exponents are taken modulo N as required by the group arithmetic.) The final summation, above, is precisely a cyclic convolution of the two sequences aq and bq of length N-1 (q = 0,...,N-2) defined by: :a_q = x_{g^q} :b_q = e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N} g^{-q} }. =Evaluating the convolution= Since N-1 is composite, this convolution can be performed directly via the convolution theorem and more conventional FFT algorithms. However, that may not be efficient if N-1 itself has large prime factors, requiring recursive use of Rader's algorithm. Instead, one can compute a length-(N-1) cyclic convolution exactly by zero-padding it to a length of at least 2(N-1)-1, say to a power of two, which can then be evaluated in O(N log N) time without the recursive application of Rader's algorithm. This algorithm, then, requires O(N) additions plus O(N log N) time for the convolution. In practice, the O(N) additions can often be performed by absorbing the additions into the convolution: if the convolution is performed by a pair of FFTs, then the sum of xn is given by the DC (0th) output of the FFT of aq plus x0, and x0 can be added to all the outputs by adding it to the DC term of the convolution prior to the inverse FFT. Still, this algorithm requires intrinsically more operations than FFTs of nearby composite sizes, and typically takes 3-10 times as long in practice. If Rader's algorithm is performed by using FFTs of size N-1 to compute the convolution, rather than by zero padding as mentioned above, the efficiency depends strongly upon N and the number of times that Rader's algorithm must be applied recursively. The worst case would be if N-1 were 2N2 where N2 is prime, with N2-1 = 2N3 where N3 is prime, and so on. In such cases, supposing that the chain of primes extended all the way down to some bounded value, the recursive application of Rader's algorithm would actually require O(N2) time. Such Nj are called Sophie Germain primes, and such a sequence of them is called a Cunningham chain of the first kind. The lengths of Cunningham chains, however, are observed to grow more slowly than log2(N), so Rader's algorithm applied in this way is probably not O(N2), though it is possibly worse than O(N log N) for the worst cases. Fortunately, a guarantee of O(N log N) complexity can be achieved by zero padding.

It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. The term astroturfing is derived from AstroTurf, a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word \\"grassroots\\". The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a \\"true\\" or \\"natural\\" grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a \\"fake\\" or \\"artificial\\" appearance of support. Definition In political science, it is defined as the process of seeking electoral victory or legislative relief for grievances by helping political actors find and mobilize a sympathetic public, and is designed to create the image of public consensus where there is none. Astroturfing is the use of fake grassroots efforts that primarily focus on influencing public opinion and typically are funded by corporations and governmental entities to form opinions. On the Internet, astroturfers use software to mask their identity. Sometimes one individual operates through many personas to give the impression of widespread support for their client's agenda. Some studies suggest astroturfing can alter public viewpoints and create enough doubt to inhibit action. In the first systematic study of astroturfing in the United States, Oxford Professor Philip N. Howard argued that the internet was making it much easier for powerful lobbyists and political movements to activate small groups of aggrieved citizens to have an exaggerated importance in public policy debates. Policies and enforcement Many countries have laws that prohibit more overt astroturfing practices. In the United States the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may send cease-and-desist orders or require a fine of $16,000 per day for those that violate its \\"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.\\" The FTC's guides were updated in 2009 to address social media and word-of-mouth marketing. According to an article in the Journal of Consumer Policy, the FTC's guides holds advertisers responsible for ensuring bloggers or product endorsers comply with the guides, and any product endorsers with a material connection are required to provide honest reviews. In the European Union, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive requires that paid-for editorial content in the media provide a clear disclosure that the content is a sponsored advertisement. Additionally, it prohibits those with a material connection from misleading readers into thinking they are a regular consumer. The United Kingdom has the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations, which prohibits \\"Falsely representing oneself as a consumer.\\" They allow for up to two years in prison and unlimited fines for breaches. Additionally, the advertising industry in the UK has adopted many voluntary policies, such as the Code of Non-Broadcast Advertising, Sale, Promotion and Direct Marketing. A trade association, the Advertising Standards Authority, investigates complaints of breaches. The policy requires that marketing professionals not mislead their audience, including by omitting a disclosure of their material connection. In Australia astroturfing is regulated by Section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law, which broadly prohibits \\"misleading and deceptive conduct.\\" According to the Journal of Consumer Policy, Australia's laws, which were introduced in 1975, are more vague. In most cases, they are enforced through lawsuits from competitors, rather than the regulatory body, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. There is also an International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN). Legal regulations are primarily targeted towards testimonials, endorsements and statements as to the performance or quality of a product. Employees of an organization may be considered acting as customers if their actions are not guided by authority within the company. In October 2018, after denying that they had paid for people to show up in support of a controversial power plant development project in New Orleans, Entergy was fined five million dollars for using astroturf firm The Hawthorn Group to provide actors to prevent real community members' voices from being counted at city council meetings and show false grassroots support.Mazza, Juliana (October 30, 2018). \\"Report: Entergy Knew It Was Paying for Actors at Not 1, but 2 Meetings.\\" WDSU News. Retrieved from WDSU.com, February 3, 2019. Debate =Effectiveness= In the book Grassroots for Hire: Public Affairs Consultants in American Democracy, Edward Walker defines \\"astroturfing\\" as public participation that is perceived as heavily incentivized, as fraudulent (claims are attributed to those who did not make such statements), or as an elite campaign masquerading as a mass movement. Although not all campaigns by professional grassroots lobbying consultants meet this definition, the book finds that the elite-sponsored grassroots campaigns often fail when they are not transparent about their sources of sponsorship and/or fail to develop partnerships with constituencies that have an independent interest in the issue. Walker highlights the case of Working Families for Wal-Mart, in which the campaign's lack of transparency led to its demise. A study published in the Journal of Business Ethics examined the effects of websites operated by front groups on students. It found that astroturfing was effective at creating uncertainty and lowering trust about claims, thereby changing perceptions that tend to favor the business interests behind the astroturfing effort. The New York Times reported that \\"consumer\\" reviews are more effective, because \\"they purport to be testimonials of real people, even though some are bought and sold just like everything else on the commercial Internet.\\" Some organizations feel that their business is threatened by negative comments, so they may engage in astroturfing to drown them out. Online comments from astroturfing employees can also sway the discussion through the influence of groupthink. =Justification= Some astroturfing operatives defend their practice. Regarding \\"movements that have organized aggressively to exaggerate their sway,\\" author Ryan Sager said that this \\"isn't cheating. Doing everything in your power to get your people to show up is basic politics.\\" According to a Porter/Novelli executive, \\"There will be times when the position you advocate, no matter how well framed and supported, will not be accepted by the public simply because you are who you are.\\" =Impact on society= Data mining expert Bing Liu (University of Illinois) estimated that one-third of all consumer reviews on the Internet are fake. According to The New York Times, this has made it hard to tell the difference between \\"popular sentiment\\" and \\"manufactured public opinion\\". According to an article in the Journal of Business Ethics, astroturfing threatens the legitimacy of genuine grassroots movements. The authors argued that astroturfing that is \\"purposefully designed to fulfill corporate agendas, manipulate public opinion and harm scientific research represents a serious lapse in ethical conduct.\\" A 2011 report found that often paid posters from competing companies are attacking each other in forums and overwhelming regular participants in the process. George Monbiot said that persona-management software supporting astroturfing \\"could destroy the Internet as a forum for constructive debate\\". An article in the Journal of Consumer Policy said that regulators and policy makers needed to be more aggressive about astroturfing. The author said that it undermines the public's ability to inform potential customers of sub-standard products or inappropriate business practices, but also noted that fake reviews were difficult to detect. Techniques Use of one or more front groups is one astroturfing technique. These groups typically present themselves as serving the public interest, while actually working on behalf of a corporate or political sponsor. Front groups may resist legislation and scientific consensus that is damaging to the sponsor's business by emphasizing minority viewpoints, instilling doubt and publishing counterclaims by corporate- sponsored experts. Fake blogs can also be created that appear to be written by consumers, while actually being operated by a commercial or political interest. Some political movements have provided incentives for members of the public to send a letter to the editor at their local paper, often using a copy and paste form letter that is published in dozens of newspapers verbatim. Another technique is the use of sockpuppets, where a single person creates multiple identities online to give the appearance of grassroots support. Sockpuppets may post positive reviews about a product, attack participants that criticize the organization, or post negative reviews and comments about competitors, under fake identities.\\"Company Settles With State Attorney General Over Fake Online Customer Reviews.\\" Computer & Internet Lawyer 26.10 (2009): 32. Computers & Applied Sciences Complete. Web. 11 Nov. 2012. Astroturfing businesses may pay staff based on the number of posts they make that are not flagged by moderators. Persona management software may be used so that each paid poster can manage five to seventy convincing online personas without getting them confused. Pharmaceutical companies may sponsor patient support groups and simultaneously push them to help market their products. Bloggers who receive free products, paid travel or other accommodations may also be considered astroturfing if those gifts are not disclosed to the reader. Analysts could be considered astroturfing, since they often cover their own clients without disclosing their financial connection. To avoid astroturfing, many organizations and press have policies about gifts, accommodations and disclosures. =Detection= Persona management software can age accounts and simulate the activity of attending a conference automatically to make it more convincing that they are genuine. At HBGary, employees are given separate thumb drives that contain online accounts for individual identities and visual cues to remind the employee which identity they are using at the time. Mass letters may be printed on personalized stationery using different typefaces, colors and words to make them appear personal. According to an article in The New York Times, the Federal Trade Commission rarely enforces its astroturfing laws. However, astroturfing operations are frequently detected if their profile images are recognized or if they are identified through the usage patterns of their accounts. Filippo Menczer's group at Indiana University developed software in 2010 that detects astroturfing on Twitter by recognizing behavioral patterns. Business and adoption According to an article in the Journal of Consumer Policy, academics disagree on how prolific astroturfing is. According to Nancy Clark from Precision Communications, grass-roots specialists charge $25 to $75 for each constituent they convince to send a letter to a politician. Paid online commentators in China are purportedly paid 50 cents for each online post that is not removed by moderators, leading to the nickname of the \\"50-cent party.\\" The New York Times reported that a business selling fake online book reviews charged $999 for 50 reviews and made $28,000 a month shortly after opening. According to the Financial Times, astroturfing is \\"commonplace\\" in American politics, but was \\"revolutionary\\" in Europe when it was exposed that the European Privacy Association, an anti-privacy \\"think-tank\\", was actually sponsored by technology companies. History of incidents =Origins= Although the term \\"astroturfing\\" was not yet developed, an early example of the practice was in Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar. In the play, Cassius writes fake letters from \\"the public\\" to convince Brutus to assassinate Caesar. The term \\"astroturfing\\" was first coined in 1985 by Texas Democratic Party senator Lloyd Bentsen when he said, \\"a fellow from Texas can tell the difference between grass roots and AstroTurf... this is generated mail.\\"Kolivos, Eugenia, and Anna Kuperman. \\"Web Of Lies ‚Äì Legal Implications Of Astroturfing.\\" Keeping Good Companies (14447614) 64.1 (2012): 38-41. Business Source Complete. Web. 10 Nov. 2012. Bentsen was describing a \\"mountain of cards and letters\\" sent to his office to promote insurance industry interests. =Tobacco= In response to the passage of tobacco control legislation in the US, Philip Morris, Burson-Marsteller and other tobacco interests created the National Smokers Alliance (NSA) in 1993. The NSA and other tobacco interests initiated an aggressive public relations campaign from 1994 to 1999 in an effort to exaggerate the appearance of grassroots support for smoker's rights. According to an article in the Journal of Health Communication, the NSA had mixed success at defeating bills that were damaging revenues of tobacco interests. =Internet= Email, automated phone calls, form letters, and the Internet made astroturfing more economical and prolific in the late 1990s. In 2001, as Microsoft was defending itself against an antitrust lawsuit, Americans for Technology Leadership (ATL), a group heavily funded by Microsoft, initiated a letter-writing campaign. ATL contacted constituents under the guise of conducting a poll and sent pro-Microsoft consumers form and sample letters to send to involved lawmakers. The effort was designed to make it appear as though there was public support for a sympathetic ruling in the antitrust lawsuit. In January 2018, YouTube user Isaac Protiva uploaded a video alleging that internet service provider Fidelity Communications was behind an initiative called \\"Stop City-Funded Internet,\\" based on how some images on the Stop City-Funded Internet website had \\"Fidelity\\" in their file names. The campaign appeared to be in response to the city of West Plains expanding their broadband network, and advocated for the end of municipal broadband on the basis that it was too risky. Days later, Fidelity released a letter admitting to sponsoring the campaign. =Politics= In 2009‚Äì2010, an Indiana University research study developed a software system to detect astroturfing on Twitter due to the sensitivity of the topic in the run up to the 2010 U.S. midterm elections and account suspensions on the social media platform. The study cited a limited number of examples, all promoting conservative policies and candidates. In 2003, GOPTeamLeader.com offered the site's users \\"points\\" that could be redeemed for products if they signed a form letter promoting George Bush and got a local paper to publish it as a letter to the editor. More than 100 newspapers published an identical letter to the editor from the site with different signatures on it. Similar campaigns were used by GeorgeWBush.com, and by MoveOn.org to promote Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's \\"Fix the Debt\\" campaign advocated to reduce government debt without disclosing that its members were lobbyists or high- ranking employees at corporations that aim to reduce federal spending. It also sent op-eds to various students that were published as-is. Some organizations in the Tea Party movement have been accused of being astroturfed. In 2018 Jeff Ballabon, a Republican operative in his mid-50s, set up a website called \\"Jexodus\\" claiming to be by \\"proud Jewish Millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics\\", but has been denounced as \\"likely a clumsy astroturf effort rather than an actual grassroots movement\\". The website was registered November 5, 2018, before the congressional election, and before those representatives accused of anti-Semitism had even been voted in. This website was later cited by Donald Trump as though it were an authentic movement. =Environment= The Koch brothers are known to have started a public advocacy group to prevent the development of wind turbines offshore in Massachusetts. The Kennedy family was also involved. Corporate efforts to mobilize the public against environmental regulation accelerated in the US following the election of president Barack Obama. In 2014, the Toronto Sun conservative media organization has published an article accusing Russia of using astroturf tactics to drum up anti-fracking sentiment across Europe and the West, supposedly in order to maintain dominance in oil exports through Ukraine. In Canada, a coalition of oil and gas company executives grouped under the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) also initiated a series of Canadian actions to advocate for the oil and gas industry in Canada through mainstream and social media, and using online campaigning to generate public support for fossil fuel energy projects. =Commercial= In 2006, two Edelman employees created a blog called \\"Wal-Marting Across America\\" about two people traveling to Wal-Marts across the country. The blog gave the appearance of being operated by spontaneous consumers, but was actually operated on behalf of Working Families for Walmart, a group funded by Wal-Mart.Stoff, Rick. \\"Astroturf-Roots Campaign.\\" St. Louis Journalism Review 36)2 (2006): 12-21. Communication & Mass Media Complete. Web. 11 Nov. 2012. In 2007, Ask.com deployed an anti-Google advertising campaign portraying Google as an \\"information monopoly\\" that was damaging the Internet. The ad was designed to give the appearance of a popular movement and did not disclose it was funded by a competitor. In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission settled a complaint with Reverb Communications, who was using interns to post favorable product reviews in Apple's iTunes store for clients. In September 2012, one of the first major identified case of astroturfing in Finland involved criticisms about the cost of a ‚Ç¨1.8 billion patient information system, which was defended by fake online identities operated by involved vendors. In September 2013, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman announced a settlement with 19 companies to prevent astroturfing. \\"'Astroturfing' is the 21st century's version of false advertising, and prosecutors have many tools at their disposal to put an end to it,\\" said Scheiderman. The companies paid $350,000 to settle the matter, but the settlement opened the way for private suits as well. \\"Every state has some version of the statutes New York used,\\" according to lawyer Kelly H. Kolb. \\"What the New York attorney general has done is, perhaps, to have given private lawyers a road map to file suit.\\" =State-sponsored= An Al Jazeera four part mini-series documented Israel's attempt to promote more friendly, pro-Israel rhetoric to influence the attitudes of British youth, namely through influencing already established political bodies, such as the National Union of Students and the Labour Party, or through the creation of other bodies not directly affiliated with the Israeli administration. In 2008, an expert on Chinese affairs, Rebecca MacKinnon, estimated the country employed 280,000 in a government-sponsored astroturfing operation to post pro-China propaganda and drown out voices of dissent. In June 2010, the United States Air Force solicited for \\"persona management\\" software that would \\"enable an operator to exercise a number of different online persons from the same workstation and without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries. Personas must be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world and can interact through conventional online services and social media platforms...\\" The $2.6 million contract was awarded to Ntrepid Corporation for astroturfing software the military would use to spread pro-American propaganda in the Middle East, and disrupt extremist propaganda and recruitment. The contract is thought to have been awarded as part of a program called Operation Earnest Voice, which was first developed as a psychological warfare weapon against the online presence of groups ranged against coalition forces.

Though no longer maintained, it is still available as a free download. History OmniWeb was originally developed by Omni Group for the NeXTSTEP platform, and was released by Lighthouse Design on March 17, 1995 after only one month's development time. As NeXTSTEP evolved into OpenStep and then Mac OS X, OmniWeb was updated to run on these platforms. These early versions of OmniWeb also run on Microsoft Windows through the Yellow Box or the OpenStep frameworks. After Lighthouse Design was bought by Sun Microsystems, the Omni Group released the product themselves, from version 2.5 onwards. From version 4.0 onwards, OmniWeb was developed solely for the OS X platform. OmniWeb was developed using the Cocoa API which allow it to take full advantage of OS X features. It uses Quartz to render images and smooth text. It makes use of multiple processors if available, and features an interface that made use of Aqua UI features such as drawers, sheets, and customizable toolbars. The Omni Group originally employed its own proprietary HTML layout engine that use standard API NSText components. However, this engine was very slow, particularly when scrolling, and was not fully compatible with the most recent web standards, such as Cascading Style Sheets. In OmniWeb version 4.5, the Omni Group adopted Apple's KHTML-based WebCore rendering engine, which was created by Apple for its Safari browser. On August 11, 2004, the Omni Group released version 5.0 of OmniWeb which added a number of new features. The most notable addition was an unusual implementation of tabbed browsing, in which the tabs are displayed vertically in a drawer on the side of the window (including optional thumbnail pictures of the pages.) Despite a certain amount of controversy over the merits of a tab drawer over a tab toolbar, the feature persists through the final version. On September 7, 2006, version 5.5 was released. Major new features include the use of a custom version of WebKit instead of WebCore, universal binary support, saving to web archive, support for user-defined style sheets, a \\"Select Next Link\\" feature, FTP folder display, ad-blocking improvements, updated localizations, and many other small changes and bug fixes. OmniWeb was Omni Group's flagship app but as OS X web browsers improved --Apple eventually bundled Safari into OS X-- and Omni successfully introduced other products such as OmniGraffle and OmniOutliner, OmniWeb's importance diminished. OmniWeb's price was successively lowered, first to $39.95, then on February 24, 2009, Omni Group announced that OmniWeb would be made available for free, a change from its previous price of $14.95. The Omni Group official website now states that the browser is no longer under active development. Features * Separate window form editing: Click the square in the upper right corner of multi line form fields to open it in a separate window. This helped when adding much text to a small area and wanting to see all of it at once. This feature also allowed you to enter tab characters. * Workspaces: groups of web browser windows and tabs in them. A user can have multiple workspaces for different web research topics and quickly switch between them with a key shortcut or menu choice * View Links: By clicking on this button in the toolbar, one can quickly view all the links contained in the page. * Ad blocking: OmniWeb uses a powerful pattern match ad blocking feature to stop images from loading from servers matching the pattern. It is also possible to block images that didn't originate from the current server and to block images that match common advertisement sizes. * Shortcuts: allows one to type a key word or phrase to open a certain web site or begin a specific web search. * Site-specific preferences: OmniWeb allows you to specify preferences that apply to specific websites. For example, if you adjust the font size on a given web page, the adjusted font size is used on all other pages of the same site. Preferences are saved automatically and retained between browsing sessions.  Reception  OmniWeb was popular in the early 2000s when the OmniGroup's experience developing for OpenStep (which became the foundation for Mac OS X) gave them an edge over other developers. Until Apple's Safari, the Omni Group had the best support for Mac OS X technologies among its competition (chiefly Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer for Mac). John Siracusa, a technology journalist and critic writing for Ars Technica, said, \\"Finding [this level of functionality] in a proper Mac OS X application from a respected developer with a proven track record is like finding a perfect 1/10,000th scale replica of the Eiffel Tower in a box of crackerjacks.

After the war, Tank spent two decades designing aircraft abroad, working first in Argentina and then in India, before returning to Germany in the late 1960s to work as a consultant for Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB). Early life Tank was born in Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), Province of Posen. His grandfather was a cavalry sergeant in the Uhlans and his father, Willi Tank, was a grenadier sergeant in the 3rd Division. When World War I broke out Tank wished to join the Deutsches Heer's then-named Fliegertruppe air service, but his father insisted he instead follow the family tradition and enlist in the cavalry. He ended the war as a captain, with many decorations for bravery. Career After the war, Tank graduated from the Technical University of Berlin in 1923. A mentor from the university secured him his first job, in the design department of Rohrbach Metallflugzeug GmbH, where he worked on flying boats and assisted in the design of the passenger aircraft, the Ro VIII Roland. Tank moved to the firm Albatros Flugzeugwerke, where he worked as a test pilot. The Albatros company went bankrupt in 1929 and in 1931, under government pressure, was merged with Focke-Wulf. Tank then started work on the design of the Fw 44 Stieglitz (Goldfinch), a two-seat civilian biplane. It was Focke-Wulf's first commercially successful design, launched in 1932.Munson, K. Fighters Between the Wars 1919-39 1977 p.129 In 1934 Tank's Fw 56 advanced trainer began production.Munson, K. Fighters Between the Wars 1919-39 1977 p.144 This led to burgeoning growth for the company as Hitler began to prepare the country for war. Ludwig Roselius, chairman and 46% majority shareholder of Focke-Wulf via Kaffee HAG, and Barbara Goette - his closest confidante, met with Kurt Tank in the Marcus-Allee, Bremen on many occasions. Barbara declared Focke- Wulf to be a \\"war-determining\\" enterprise.Leidig, Ludwig. Bombshell. sbpra, 2013; p21,22. In 1936 Tank designed the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor to a Deutsche Luft Hansa specification. The first flight was in July 1937 after just under one year of development with Tank at the controls. The Condor made a famous non-stop flight from Berlin to New York City in 1938, proving the concept of transatlantic air travel. The Condor would later be used as a maritime patrol bomber aircraft of some repute during the war. =World War II= Major G√ºnther Specht (left) and Kurt Tank (right) The Fw 190 W√ºrger (Shrike), first flying in 1939 and produced from 1941 to 1945, was a mainstay Luftwaffe single-seat fighter during World War II, and Tank's most-produced (over 20,000) and famous design. In January 1943, he was named honorary professor with a chair at the Technical University of Braunschweig, in recognition of his work developing aircraft. In 1944, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (German Air Ministry) decided that new fighter aircraft designations must include the chief designer's name. Kurt Tank's new designs were therefore given the prefix Ta. His most notable late-war design was the Ta 152, a continuation of the Fw 190 design. =Postwar= After the war, Tank negotiated with the United Kingdom, the Nationalist government of China, and representatives of the Soviet Union; when the negotiations proved unsuccessful, he accepted an offer from Argentina to work at its aerotechnical institute, the Instituto Aerot√©cnico in C√≥rdoba under the name of Pedro Matthies. The British government decided not to offer him a contract on the grounds that they could not see how he could be integrated into a research project or design group. He moved to C√≥rdoba in late 1946, with many of his Focke-Wulf co-workers. One of these was Ronald Richter, who intended to power airplanes with nuclear energy, to be developed in the Huemul Project, which was later proven to be a fraud according to some. The Instituto Aerot√©cnico later became Argentina's military aeroplane factory, the F√°brica Militar de Aviones. There, he designed the IAe Pulqui II based on the Focke-Wulf Ta 183 design that had reached mock-up stage by the end of the war. It was a state- of-the-art design for its day, but the project was cancelled after the fall of Peron in 1955. When President Juan Per√≥n fell from power, the ex-Focke-Wulf team dispersed, with many, including Tank, moving to India. First he worked as Director of the Madras Institute of Technology, where one of his students was Abdul Kalam (later President of India). He designed an indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and worked for the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme). Tank later joined Hindustan Aeronautics, where he designed the Hindustan Marut fighter-bomber, the first military aircraft constructed in India. The first prototype flew in 1961, and the Marurt was retired from active service in 1985. Tank left Hindustan Aeronautics in 1967 and by the 1970s had returned to live in Berlin, basing himself in Germany for the rest of his life. He worked as a consultant for MBB.. He died in Munich in 1983.

The term pyromania comes from the Greek word œÄ·ø¶œÅ (pyr, fire). Pyromania is distinct from arson, the deliberate setting of fires for personal, monetary or political gain. Pyromaniacs start fires to induce euphoria, and often fixate on institutions of fire control like fire houses and firemen. Pyromania is a type of impulse control disorder, along with kleptomania, intermittent explosive disorder and others. Signs and symptoms There are specific symptoms that separate pyromaniacs from those who start fires for criminal purposes or due to emotional motivations not specifically related to fire. Someone suffering from this disorder deliberately and purposely sets fires on more than one occasion, and before the act of lighting the fire the person usually experiences tension and an emotional buildup. When around fires, a person suffering from pyromania gains intense interest or fascination and may also experience pleasure, gratification or relief . Another long term contributor often linked with pyromania is the buildup of stress. When studying the lifestyle of someone with pyromania, a buildup of stress and emotion is often evident and this is seen in teens' attitudes towards friends and family . At times it is difficult to distinguish the difference between pyromania and experimentation in childhood because both involve pleasure from the fire. Causes Most studied cases of pyromania occur in children and teenagers . There is a range of causes, but an understanding of the different motives and actions of fire setters can provide a platform for prevention. Common causes of pyromania can be broken down into two main groups: individual and environmental. This includes the complex understanding of factors such as individual temperament, parental psychopathology, and possible neurochemical predispositions. Many studies have shown that patients with pyromania were in households without a father figure present. = Environmental = Environmental factors that may lead to pyromania include an event that the patient has experienced in the environment they live in. Environmental factors include neglect from parents and physical or emotional abuse in earlier life. Other causes include early experiences of watching adults or teenagers using fire inappropriately and lighting fires as a stress reliever . Treatment and prognosis The appropriate treatment for pyromania varies with the age of the patient and the seriousness of the condition. For children and adolescents treatment usually is cognitive behavioral therapy sessions in which the patient's situation is diagnosed to find out what may have caused this impulsive behavior. Once the situation is diagnosed, repeated therapy sessions usually help continue to a recovery . Other important steps must be taken as well with the interventions and the cause of the impulse behavior. Some other treatments measures include parenting training, over-correction/satiation/negative practice with corrective consequences, behavior contracting/token reinforcement, special problem-solving skills training, relaxation training, covert sensitization, fire safety and prevention education, individual and family therapy, and medication. The prognosis for recovery in adolescents and children who suffer from pyromania depends on the environmental or individual factors in play, but is generally positive. Pyromania is generally harder to treat in adults, often due to lack of cooperation by the patient. Treatment usually consists of more medication to prevent stress or emotional outbursts in addition to long-term psychotherapy . In adults, however, the recovery rate is generally poor and if an adult does recover it usually takes a longer period of time . History Pyromania was thought in the 1800s to be a concept involved with moral insanity and moral treatment, but had not been categorized under impulse control disorders. Pyromania is one of the four recognized types of arson, alongside burning for profit, to cover up an act of crime and for revenge. Pyromania is the second most common type of arson. Common synonyms for pyromaniacs in colloquial English include firebug (US) and fire raiser (UK), but these also refer to arsonists. Pyromania is a rare disorder with an incidence of less than one percent in most studies; also, pyromaniacs hold a very small proportion of psychiatric hospital admissions . Pyromania can occur in children as young as age three, though such cases are rare. Only a small percentage of children and teenagers arrested for arson are child pyromaniacs. A preponderance of the individuals are male;Barker AF (1994) Arson: A Review of the Psychiatric Literature. Oxford: Oxford University Press. one source states that ninety percent of those diagnosed with pyromania are male. Based on a survey of 9,282 Americans using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, impulse-control problems such as gambling, pyromania and compulsive shopping collectively affect 9% of the population . A 1979 study by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration found that only 14% of fires were started by pyromaniacs and others with mental illness . A 1951 study by Lewis and Yarnell, one of the largest epidemiological studies conducted, found that 39% of those who had intentionally set fires had been diagnosed with pyromania.Robert E.

It pitted the Continental Army, commanded by General George Washington, against the British Army in North America, commanded by General Sir Henry Clinton. It was the last battle of the Philadelphia campaign, begun the previous year, during which the British had inflicted two major defeats on Washington and occupied Philadelphia. Washington had spent the winter at Valley Forge rebuilding his army and defending his position against political enemies who favored his replacement as commander-in-chief. In February 1778, the France-American alliance tilted the strategic balance in favor of the Americans, forcing the British to abandon hopes of a military victory and adopt a defensive strategy. Clinton was ordered to evacuate Philadelphia and consolidate his army. The Continental Army shadowed the British as they marched across New Jersey to Sandy Hook, from where the Royal Navy would ferry them to New York. Washington's senior officers urged varying degrees of caution, but it was politically important for him not to allow the British to withdraw unscathed. Washington detached around a third of his army and sent it ahead under the command of Major General Charles Lee, hoping to land a heavy blow on the British without becoming embroiled in a major engagement. The battle began badly for the Americans when Lee botched an attack on the British rearguard at Monmouth Court House. A counter-attack by the main British column forced Lee to retreat until Washington arrived with the main body. Clinton disengaged when he found Washington in an unassailable defensive position and resumed the march to Sandy Hook. Clinton had divided his army into two divisions for the march from Philadelphia; most of the combat troops were concentrated in the first division, while the second comprised most of the heavy transport of a 1,500-wagon baggage train. The British were harassed by increasingly strong American forces as they traversed New Jersey, and by June 27, Lee's vanguard was within striking distance. When the British left Monmouth Court House the next day, Lee attempted to isolate and defeat their rearguard. The attack was poorly coordinated, and the Americans were quickly outnumbered when the British first division returned. Some of Lee's units began to withdraw, leading to a breakdown in command and control and forcing Lee to order a general retreat. A fiercely fought rearguard action by the vanguard gave Washington enough time to deploy the main body in a strong defensive position, against which British efforts to press the vanguard foundered. The infantry battle gave way to a two-hour artillery duel, during which Clinton began to disengage. The duel ended when a Continental brigade established artillery on a hill overlooking the British lines, forcing Clinton to withdraw his guns. Washington launched two small-unit attacks on Clinton's infantry as they withdrew, inflicting heavy casualties on the British during the second. An attempt by Washington to probe the British flanks was halted by sunset, and the two armies settled down within of each other. The British slipped away unnoticed during the night to link up with the baggage train. The rest of the march to Sandy Hook was completed without further incident, and Clinton's army was ferried to New York in early July. The battle was tactically inconclusive and strategically irrelevant; neither side landed the blow they hoped to on the other, Washington's army remained an effective force in the field and the British redeployed successfully to New York. The Continental Army inflicted more casualties than it suffered, and it was one of the rare occasions on which it retained possession of a battlefield. It had proven itself to be much improved after the training it underwent over the winter, and the professional conduct of the American troops during the battle was widely noted by the British. Washington was able to present the battle as a triumph, and he was voted a formal thanks by Congress to honor \\"the important victory of Monmouth over the British grand army.\\" His position as commander-in-chief became unassailable. He was lauded for the first time as the Father of his Country, and his detractors were silenced. Lee was vilified for his failure to press home the attack on the British rearguard. Because of his tactless efforts to argue his case in the days after the battle, Washington had him arrested and court-martialed on charges of disobeying orders, conducting an \\"unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat\\" and disrespect towards the commander-in- chief. Lee made the fatal mistake of turning the proceedings into a contest between himself and Washington. He was found guilty on all counts, although his culpability on the first two charges was debatable. Today, the site of the battle is a New Jersey State Park which preserves the land for the public, called Monmouth Battlefield State Park. Background alt=Contemporary painting In 1777, some two years into the American Revolutionary War, the British commander-in-chief General Sir William Howe launched the Philadelphia campaign to capture the rebels' capital and persuade them to sue for peace. In the fall of that year, Howe inflicted two significant defeats on General George Washington and his Continental Army, at Brandywine and Germantown, and occupied Philadelphia, forcing the Second Continental Congress to hurriedly decamp to York, Pennsylvania.Ferling 2009 pp. 130‚Äì135, 140Martin 1993 p. 12 Washington avoided battle for the rest of the year, and in December he withdrew to winter quarters at Valley Forge, despite the desire of Congress that he continue campaigning.Ferling 2009 pp. 147‚Äì148, 151‚Äì152Ellis 2004 p. 109Lender & Stone 2016 p. 24 In comparison, his subordinate General Horatio Gates had won major victories in September and October at the Battles of Saratoga.Ferling 2009 pp. 126‚Äì128, 137 Washington was criticized in some quarters within the army and Congress for relying on a Fabian strategy to wear the British down in a long war of attrition instead of defeating it decisively in a pitched battle.Ferling 2009 pp. 141, 148 In November, Washington was hearing rumors of a \\"Strong Faction\\" within Congress that favored replacing him with Gates as commander-in-chief.Ferling 2009 p. 139 The congressional appointments of the known critic General Thomas Conway as Inspector General of the Army and of Gates to the Board of War and Ordnance in December convinced Washington there was a conspiracy to take command of the army from him.Ferling 2009 pp. 152‚Äì153 Over a winter in which supplies were scarce and deaths from disease accounted for 15 per cent of his force, he battled to keep both the army from dissolution and his position as its commander-in-chief.Ferling 2009 pp. 157‚Äì165 He successfully waged a \\"clever campaign of political infighting\\"Ferling 2009 p. 171 in which he presented a public image of disinterest, a man without guile or ambition, while working through his allies in Congress and the army to silence his critics.Ferling 2009 pp. 161‚Äì164Lender & Stone 2016 p. 42 Nevertheless, the doubts about his leadership remained, and he needed success on the battefield if he was to be sure of his position. The British, meanwhile, had failed to eliminate the Continental Army and force a decisive end to the American rebellion, despite investing significant resources in North America to the detriment of defenses elsewhere in the empire.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 7, 12, 14 In Europe, France was maneuvering to exploit the opportunity to weaken a long-term rival. Following the Franco- American alliance of February 1778, French forces were sent to North America to support the revolutionaries. This led to the Anglo-French War (1778‚Äì1783), which Spain would join on the French side in 1779. With the rest of Europe moving towards a hostile neutrality, Great Britain would come under further pressure in 1780 when the Dutch allied with France, leading to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Faced with military escalation, increasing diplomatic isolation and limited resources, the British were forced to prioritize the defense of the homeland and more valuable colonial possessions in the Caribbean and India above their North American colonies. They abandoned their efforts to win a decisive military victory, repealed the Intolerable Acts which had precipitated the rebellion and, in April 1778, sent the Carlisle Peace Commission in an attempt to reach a negotiated settlement. In Philadelphia, the newly installed commander-in-chief General Sir Henry Clinton was ordered to redeploy 8,000 troops, a third of his army, to the West Indies and Florida, consolidate the rest of his army in New York and adopt a defensive posture.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 12‚Äì15Chernow 2010 p. 442Ferling 2009 p. 175 =Continental Army= alt=Contemporary painting Washington's preference for a professional standing army rather than a militia had been another source of criticism.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 28 He had seen his army dissolve in the fall of 1775 as short-term enlistments expired, and blamed his defeat in the Battle of Long Island in August 1776 in part on a poorly performing militia.Ferling 2009 p. 118 At his urging, Congress passed legislation between September and December 1776 to create an army in which troops would enlist for the duration. Recruitment failed to raise sufficient numbers, and the harsh discipline implemented by Washington, the long periods away from home and the defeats of 1777 further weakened the army through desertions and frequent officer resignations. Although the army that went into Valley Forge contained the kernel of regimental organization and a core of experienced officers and men, no-one was under any illusion that it was a match for the tactical skill of the British Army.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 60‚Äì64, 66 The situation improved measurably with the arrival in March 1778 of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, to whom Washington gave the responsibility for training the army. With the commander-in-chief's enthusiastic support, Steuben implemented a uniform standard of drill where none had previously existed and worked the army hard, transforming it into a more professional force that might compete on equal terms with the British Army.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 65‚Äì66, 68Ellis 2004 pp. 116‚Äì117 On May 21, Major General Charles Lee rejoined the Continental Army. Lee was a former British Army officer who had retired to Virginia before the revolution and had been touted as a potential commander of the army alongside Washington when war broke out. He had been captured in December 1776 following Washington's defeat at New York, and had been released in April in a prisoner exchange. He had been critical of Washington's indecisiveness at New York and insubordinate during the retreat from the city. But Washington had regarded him as his most trusted adviser and the best officer in the Continental Army, and he eagerly welcomed Lee back as his second-in-command.Ferling 2009 pp. 84, 105, 175Chernow 2010 p. 443Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 110, 112, 117 Sixteen months in captivity had not mellowed Lee. He remained respectful to Washington's face but continued to be critical about the commander-in-chief's abilities to others, and it is likely that Washington's friends reported this back to Washington.Ferling 2009 pp. 178‚Äì179Chernow 2010 p. 444 Lee was dismissive of the Continental Army, denigrated Steuben's efforts to improve it and went over Washington's head to submit to Congress a plan to reorganize it on a militia basis, prompting Washington to reprove him.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 114‚Äì120 Nevertheless, Lee was respected by many of Washington's officers and held in high esteem by Congress, and Washington gave him command of the division that would soon lead the Continental Army out of Valley Forge.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 105, 118 =Prelude= alt=Contemporary painting In April, before news of the French alliance reached him, Washington issued a memorandum to his generals seeking their opinions on three possible alternatives for the upcoming campaign: attack the British in Philadelphia, shift operations to New York or remain on the defensive at Valley Forge and continue to build up the army. Of the twelve responses, all agreed it was vital that, whatever course was chosen, the army had to perform well if public support for the revolution was to be maintained after the disappointments of the previous year. Most generals supported one or other of the offensive options, but Washington sided with the minority, among them Steuben, who argued the Continental Army still needed improvement at Valley Forge before it was ready to take on the British. After news of the Franco-American alliance arrived and as British activity in and around Philadelphia increased, Washington met with ten of his generals on May 8 to further discuss plans. This time they unanimously favored the defensive option and waiting until the British intentions became clearer.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 76‚Äì82 In May, it became evident that the British were preparing to evacuate Philadelphia, but Washington still had no detailed knowledge of Clinton's intentions and was concerned that the British would slip away overland through New Jersey. The 2nd New Jersey Regiment, which had been conducting operations against British foragers and sympathizers in New Jersey since March, was a valuable source of intelligence, and by the end of the month a British evacuation by land looked increasingly likely. Washington reinforced the regiment with the rest of the New Jersey Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General William Maxwell, with orders to obstruct and harry British activities.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 85‚Äì86, 88‚Äì90 The Continentals were to co- operate with the experienced New Jersey militia, commanded by Major General Philemon Dickinson, one of the most capable militia commanders of the war and Washington's single best source of intelligence on British activities.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 92‚Äì94 On May 18, Washington sent the inexperienced, 20-year-old Major General Lafayette with 2,200 men to establish an observation post at Barren Hill, from Philadelphia. The Frenchman's first significant independent command almost ended in disaster for him two days later in the Battle of Barren Hill, and only the discipline of his men prevented his entrapment by the British.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 91 March from Philadelphia alt=map On June 15, the British began to withdraw from Philadelphia, crossing the River Delaware into New Jersey. The last troops crossed three days later, and the army consolidated around Haddonfield. Clinton, who had not yet decided on the exact route to New York approximately away, divided his army into two divisions and set out for Allentown, some to the northeast. He accompanied the first division, which comprised some 10,000 troops under the command of Lieutenant General Charles Lord Cornwallis. The second division, commanded by Lieutenant General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, comprised just over 9,000 personnel, of which over 7,500 were combatants. This division contained the bulk of the slow-moving heavy transport of the 1,500-wagon baggage train.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 97‚Äì98, 123‚Äì124, 126‚Äì127 The march was conducted in short segments during a heat wave in which temperatures frequently exceeded , which further slowed progress and caused casualties from heat exhaustion. The slow progress did not concern Clinton. He was confident his troops were more than a match for Washington's forces and felt that a major battle would compensate for the humiliation of having to abandon Philadelphia and might even deal a serious blow to the rebellion.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 141‚Äì143Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 122 Wherever possible, the two divisions followed parallel routes which allowed them to be mutually supporting. Light troops and pioneers screened the route ahead of the main force and cleared obstacles, combat units were embedded with the baggage train and battalion-sized units provided flank guards.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 127, 131‚Äì132 The frequent sniping and skirmishing of Maxwell's Continentals and Dickinson's militia, and their attempts to obstruct and hinder the British by blocking roads, destroying bridges and spoiling wells, did not materially impede progress.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 127‚Äì141Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 121 On June 24, the first division arrived at Allentown while the second reached Imlaystown, to the east.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 140 Clinton decided to head for Sandy Hook, from where the Royal Navy could ferry his army to New York. When the march resumed at 04:00 the next day, the road network made it impossible for the two divisions to follow separate routes and still remain within supporting distance of each other. Knyphausen's second division led the column on the road towards Monmouth Court House (modern-day Freehold). Cornwallis followed, Guards and Grenadiers at the rear, putting his combat-heavy division between the baggage train and the likely direction of attack. At the end of the day, Knyphausen camped at Freehold Township, some from Monmouth Court House, while Clinton established his headquarters at Robin's Rising Sun Tavern, from Knyphausen.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 150‚Äì154Martin 1993 p. 204 The next day, June 26, the British suffered almost forty casualties in near-constant skirmishing in which one unit came close to being overrun. Knyphausen reached Monmouth Court House early that morning, and by 10:00 the entire column had concentrated there. It was clear to Clinton that Washington's forces were gathering in numbers, and the British were exhausted after their march from Philadelphia. Monmouth Court House offered a good defensive position, and it is possible that Clinton saw an opportunity for the battle he desired. He deployed his army to cover all approaches and decided to rest his troops for the next two nights. The bulk of his force, the first division, was deployed on the Allentown road, covering the second division in the village.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 156‚Äì158 The revolution had precipitated a vicious civil war in Monmouth County that did credit to neither side and which would continue after the armies had departed.Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 47‚Äì48 It was fought between Patriots, who sided with the rebellion, and Loyalists, who remained loyal to Great Britain and even formed units, such as the Queen's American Rangers, which fought alongside the British Army.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xviii, 212 The two sides also fought each other in the civil arena, and it is estimated that fifty per cent of Monmouth County families suffered significant harm to person or property during the war.Adelberg 2010 pp. 32‚Äì33 By spring 1778, the formerly loyalist Monmouth Court House had come under patriot control.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 211, 213 When the British arrived, they found themselves in an enemy settlement that had been largely deserted by its inhabitants. Clinton's orders against pillaging were ignored by the rank and file and went unenforced by the officers. British and Hessian soldiers acting out of frustration and anger, and Loyalists acting out of rage and vengeance, committed numerous acts of vandalism, looting and arson. By the time Clinton resumed the march on June 28, thirteen of the village's near two dozen buildings had been destroyed, all of them Patriot owned.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 201, 214‚Äì216 =Pursuit= Washington learned the British were evacuating Philadelphia on June 17. He immediately convened a war council, at which all but two of seventeen generals believed the Continental Army still could not win a pitched battle against the British, Lee arguing it would be criminal to attempt one. Unsure of Clinton's exact intentions and with his officers urging caution, Washington determined to pursue the British and move to within striking distance. Lee's brigades led the Continental Army out of Valley Forge on the afternoon of June 18, and four days later the last troops crossed the Delaware into New Jersey at Coryell's Ferry.Ferling 2009 pp. 175‚Äì176Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 99‚Äì104, 173 Washington divided his army into two wings commanded by Lee and Major General Lord Stirling and a reserve commanded by Lafayette. Traveling light, Washington reached Hopewell on June 23, less than north of the British at Allentown. While the army set up camp, Colonel Daniel Morgan was ordered south with 600 light infantry to reinforce Maxwell and Dickinson.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 161‚Äì167 On June 24, Dickinson informed Washington the efforts he and Maxwell were making to slow Clinton were having little impact, and that he believed Clinton was deliberately lingering in New Jersey to provoke a battle.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 172 Washington convened another war council in which the twelve officers who attended all recommended varying degrees of caution. Lee argued that a victory would be of little benefit while a defeat would do irrevocable damage to the revolutionary cause. He preferred not to risk the Continental Army against a professional, well-trained enemy until French intervention swayed the odds in the Americans' favor and proposed that Clinton should be allowed to proceed to New York unmolested. Four other generals agreed. Even the most aggressive of the remainder wanted to avoid a major engagement; Brigadier General Anthony Wayne suggested the dispatch of 2,500‚Äì3,000 additional troops to reinforce Maxwell and Dickinson that would enable them, with a third of the army, to make \\"an Impression in force.\\" In the end, a compromise was agreed in which 1,500 picked men would reinforce the vanguard to \\"act as occasion may serve.\\" To Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton, who attended as an aide, the council \\"would have done honor to the most honorab[le] society of midwives, and to them only.\\" A disappointed Washington sent the token force under the command of Brigadier General Charles Scott.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 172‚Äì174 Soon after the council adjourned, Wayne ‚Äì who had refused to put his name to the compromise ‚Äì Lafayette and Major General Nathanael Greene contacted Washington individually with the same plea for a stronger vanguard action supported by the main body, while still avoiding a major battle. Lafayette assured Washington that Steuben and Brigadier General Louis Duportail agreed, and told Washington it \\"would be disgraceful for the leaders and humiliating for the troops to allow the enemy to cross the Jerseys with impunity.\\" Greene emphasized the political aspect, advising Washington the public expected him to attack and that even if a limited attack did lead to a major battle, he thought their chances of success were good. It was all Washington, keen to erase the defeats of the previous year and prove his critics wrong, needed to hear. By the early hours of June 25 he had ordered Wayne to follow Scott with another 1,000 picked men. He wanted to do more than simply harass Clinton and, while still avoiding the risk of a major battle, hoped to inflict a heavy blow on the British, one that would surpass his success at the Battle of Trenton in 1776.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 175‚Äì177Ferling 2009 pp. 176‚Äì177 =Reining in Lafayette= alt=Contemporary painting Washington offered Lee command of the vanguard, but Lee declined, stating the force was too small for a man of his rank and position. Washington appointed Lafayette instead, with orders to attack \\"with the whole force of your command\\" if the opportunity presented itself. Lafayette failed to establish full control of the disparate forces under his command, and in his haste to catch the British, he pushed his troops to breaking point and outran his supplies. Washington grew increasingly concerned, and on the morning of June 26 he warned Lafayette not to \\"distress your men by an over hasty march.\\" By that afternoon, Lafayette was at Robin's Tavern, where Clinton had stayed the previous night. He was within three miles of the British, too far away from the main army for it to support him, and his men were exhausted and hungry. He remained eager to fight and discussed with his officers a night march with the intention of striking Clinton the next morning.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 177‚Äì180 That evening, Washington ordered Lafayette to leave Morgan and the militia behind as a screen and move to Englishtown, where he would be back in range of both supplies and the main army.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 181‚Äì182 By this time Lee, having realized Lafayette's force was more significant than he first thought, had changed his mind and requested command of it. Washington ordered Lee to take Scott's former brigade and the brigade of Brigadier General James Varnum, link up with Lafayette in Englishtown and take command of all advance forces. Greene took over command of Lee's wing of the main body.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 186‚Äì189 By June 27, Lafayette was safely back in the fold with what was now Lee's vanguard of some 4,500 troops at Englishtown, from the British at Monmouth Court House. Washington was with the main body of just over 7,800 troops and the bulk of the artillery at Manalapan Bridge, behind Lee.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 188, 190, 234 Morgan's light infantry, now increased to 800 men by the addition of a militia detachment, was at Richmond Mills, a little over to the south of Monmouth Court House.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 168, 185, 234 Dickinson's 1,200 or more militia were on Clinton's flanks, with a significant concentration about west of Monmouth Court House.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 234 Battle alt=map On the afternoon of June 27, Washington conferred with the vanguard's senior officers at Englishtown but did not offer a battle plan. Lee believed he had full discretion on whether and how to attack and called his own war council after Washington left. He intended to advance as soon as he knew Clinton was on the move, in the hope of catching the British rearguard when it was most vulnerable. In the absence of any intelligence about Clinton's intentions or the terrain, Lee believed it would be useless to form a precise plan of his own; he told his commanders only to be ready for action at short notice and follow his orders.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 191‚Äì193 In response to a written order received from Washington in the early hours of June 28, Lee ordered Colonel William Grayson to take 700 men forward. They were to watch for any British move and, if one did occur, try and slow them to give the vanguard time to close the distance.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 194 Grayson did not depart Englishtown until 06:00, an hour after news arrived that Clinton was on the move.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 198 Both vanguard and main body broke camp immediately, and both were slow to move; the vanguard was delayed when brigades formed up in the wrong march order and the main body was slowed by its artillery train.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 236‚Äì237 At 07:00, Lee rode ahead to scout the situation for himself. Following some confusion when a militia rider erroneously reported the British were not withdrawing but preparing to attack, Lee learned that the British had begun moving at 02:00 and only a small party of infantry and cavalry remained in the area.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 238‚Äì240 Clinton's first move had been to deploy the Queen's Rangers northwest of Monmouth Court House to cover the departure of the second division, scheduled for an hour later but delayed until 04:00. By 05:00, the first division had begun moving, and the last British troops left Monmouth Court House by 09:15, heading northeast on the road to Middletown. Trailing the column was the rearguard, comprising a battalion of light infantry and a regiment of dragoons which, with the Rangers, totaled 1,550‚Äì2,000 troops.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 249, 468Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 190 =Advance to contact= alt=map The first shots were exchanged around 08:00 in an entirely American skirmish between a small detachment of Rangers and Dickinson's militia. Grayson arrived just in time to deploy his troops in support of the militia near a bridge over a ravine and watch the Rangers withdraw.Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 240‚Äì248 The bridge was on the Englishtown‚ÄìMonmouth Court House road and spanned the Spotswood Middle Brook, one of three ravines bordered by marshy wetlands or 'morasses' that cut through what would soon become a battlefield. Other than by bridge, the ravines were negotiable with difficulty by infantry and not at all by artillery; any unit cut off on the wrong side or pinned up against them would find itself in grave danger. When Lee caught up with Grayson shortly after the skirmish, Dickinson, who still believed the British occupied Monmouth Court House in force, strongly urged him not to venture across the brook. With intelligence about British activity still contradictory, Lee lost an hour at the bridge. He did not advance until Lafayette arrived with the rest of the vanguard.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 250‚Äì253Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 188‚Äì189 Once the vanguard was concentrated at the bridge, Lee replaced Grayson with Wayne to command the approximately 550-man lead element, which comprised detachments led by Colonel Richard Butler, Colonel Henry Jackson and Grayson (returned to the command of his original composite battalion of Virginians), supported by four artillery.Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 186, 195Lender & Stone 2016 p. 253 The vanguard advanced along the Englishtown road towards Monmouth Court House until it reached the junction with the road north to Foreman's Mill at around 09:30. Lee went forward with Wayne to reconnoiter Monmouth Court House, where they discovered the British rearguard. Estimating the British strength at some 2,000 men, Lee decided on a plan to hook round to their rear. He left Wayne with orders to fix the rearguard in place and returned to the rest of the vanguard to lead it on a left flanking maneuver. Lee's confidence crept into reports back to Washington that implied \\"the certainty of success.\\"Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 253‚Äì255, 261 After Lee departed, Butler's detachment exchanged fire with mounted troops screening the rearguard, prompting the British to begin withdrawing to the northeast, towards the main column. In the subsequent pursuit, Wayne repulsed a charge by British dragoons and launched a feint against the British infantry, prompting the rearguard to halt and form up on a hill at the junction of the Middletown and Shrewsbury roads.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 255, 256, 258‚Äì260 Meanwhile, because Lee was leading the rest of the vanguard himself, he neglected to provide Scott and Maxwell with a detailed plan.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 256 After a march, he emerged from some woods at around 10:30, in time to witness Wayne's troops in action to his left.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 261‚Äì263 When it became evident the British were present in considerably larger numbers than he had anticipated, Lee operated with Lafayette to secure what he considered to be a vulnerable right flank. On the left flank, the appearance of another British force 2,000‚Äì3,000 strong prompted Jackson to pull his regiment back from its isolated position on the banks of Spotswood North Brook.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 262‚Äì264 In the vanguard center, Scott and Maxwell, who was to Scott's left, were not in communication with Lee and not privy to his plan. They felt increasingly isolated watching Lee push out the right flank, and with British troops marching towards Monmouth Court House to their south, they became apprehensive about being cut off. They agreed between themselves to adjust their positions; Scott fell back a short distance southwest across the Spotswood Middle Brook to a more defensible position while Maxwell pulled back with the intention of circling round and coming up on Scott's right flank.Lender & Stone 2016 pp.265‚Äì266Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 199 Lee was dumbfounded when the two staff officers he had sent with orders for Scott returned with the news that he was nowhere to be found and disconcerted by their reports of the British returning in force. When he observed part of Lafayette's force retreating after a failed attempt to silence some British artillery, it appeared to Lee that the right flank too was pulling back without orders. It had become clear that he was losing control of the vanguard, and with his immediate command now only 2,500 strong, he realized his plan to envelop the British rearguard was finished. His priority now was the safety of his command in the face of superior numbers.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 266‚Äì269 =Counter-attack and retreat= alt=map As soon as he received news that his rearguard was being probed, Clinton ordered Cornwallis to march the first division back towards Monmouth Court House. He believed Washington's main body was not close enough to come up in support and that the terrain would make it difficult for Lee to maneuver. He intended to do more than simply defend his baggage train; he thought the vanguard was vulnerable, and saw an opportunity to turn its right flank, just as Lee had feared, and destroy it.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 264‚Äì265, 273 After pausing at Monmouth Court House, Clinton began to push westwards. He formed his best troops into two columns, Guards on the right, Grenadiers on the left and the guns of the Royal Artillery between them, while a regiment of dragoons ranged about them. The infantry of the 3rd and 4th Brigades followed in line, while the 5th Brigade remained in reserve at Monmouth Court House. The Queen's Rangers and the infantry of the rearguard operated on the British right flank. To the rear, a brigade of Hessian grenadiers remained in a defensive line to which Clinton could fall back if things went badly.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 273‚Äì274, 275 In total, his force comprised some 10,000 troops.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 265 Lee ordered a general retreat to a line about to the west of Monmouth Court House that ran from Craig's House, north of Spotswood Middle Brook, to Ker's House, south of the brook. He had significant difficulties communicating with his subordinates and exhausted his aides attempting to do so. Although he arrived in the vicinity of Ker's house with a sizeable force by noon, he was unable to exercise command and control of it as a unified organization. As disorganized as the retreat was for Lee, at unit level it was generally conducted with a discipline that did credit to Steuben's training. The Americans suffered only some one dozen casualties as they fell back, an indication of how little major fighting there was; there were no organized volleys by infantry muskets, and only the artillery engaged in any significant action.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 268‚Äì272 Lee believed he had conducted a model \\"retrograde manoeuver in the face and under fire of an enemy\\" and claimed his troops moved with \\"order and precision.\\" He had remained calm during the retreat but began to unravel at Ker's house. When two of Washington's aides informed Lee that the main body was still some away and asked him what to report back, Lee replied \\"that he really did not know what to say.\\"Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 270‚Äì271 Crucially, he failed to keep Washington informed of the retreat.Ferling 2009 p. 178 Lee realized that a knoll in front of his lines would give the British, now deployed from column into line formation, command of the ground and render his position untenable. With no knowledge of the main body's whereabouts and believing he had little choice, Lee decided to fall back farther, across the Spotswood Middle Brook bridge. He believed he would be able to hold the British there from Perrine's Hill until the main body came up in support. With his aides out of action, Lee pressed whomever he could find into service as messengers to organize the withdrawal. It was during this period that he sent the army auditor, Major John Clark, to Washington with news of the retreat. But Washington was by now aware, having learned from Lee's troops who had already crossed the ravine.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 278‚Äì281, 284Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 203 =Washington's arrival= The main body had reached Englishtown at 10:00, and by noon it was still some from Monmouth Court House. Without any recent news from Lee, Washington had no reason to be concerned. At Tennent's Meeting House, some east of Englishtown, he ordered Greene to take Brigadier General William Woodford's brigade of some 550 men and 4 artillery pieces south then east to cover the right flank. The rest of the main body continued east along the Englishtown‚ÄìMonmouth Court House road. In the space of some ten minutes, Washington's confidence gave way to alarm as he encountered a straggler bearing the first news of Lee's retreat and then whole units in retreat. None of the officers Washington met could tell him where they were supposed to be going or what they were supposed to be doing. As the commander-in-chief rode on ahead, over the bridge and towards the front line, he saw the vanguard in full retreat but no sign of the British. At around 12:45, Washington found Lee marshalling the last of his command across the middle morass, marshy ground southeast of the bridge.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 281‚Äì286 Expecting praise for a retreat he believed had been generally conducted in good order, Lee was uncharacteristically lost for words when Washington asked without pleasantries, \\"I desire to know, sir, what is the reason ‚Äì whence arises this disorder and confusion?\\"Lender & Stone 2016 p. 289 When he regained his composure, Lee attempted to explain his actions. He blamed faulty intelligence and his officers, especially Scott, for pulling back without orders, leaving him no choice but to retreat in the face of a superior force, and reminded Washington that he had opposed the attack in the first place.Chernow 2010 p. 448 Washington was not convinced; \\"All this may be very true, sir,\\" he replied, \\"but you ought not to have undertaken it unless you intended to go through with it.\\" Washington made it clear he was disappointed with Lee and rode off to organize the battle he felt his subordinate should have given. Lee followed at a distance, bewildered and believing he had been relieved of command.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 289‚Äì290 With the main body still arriving and the British no more than away, Washington began to rally the vanguard to set up the very defenses Lee had been attempting to organize. The commander-in- chief directed Wayne to take three battalions and form a rearguard in the Point of Woods, south of the Spotswood Middle Brook, that could delay the British. He issued orders for the 2nd New Jersey Regiment and two smaller Pennsylvanian regiments to deploy on the slopes of Perrine's Hill, north of the brook overlooking the bridge; they would be the rallying point for the rest of the vanguard and the position on which the main body would form. Washington offered Lee a choice: remain and command the rearguard, or fall back to and organize the main body. Lee opted for the former and, as Washington departed to take care of the latter, promised he would \\"be the last one to leave the field.\\"Ferling 2009 p. 179Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 291‚Äì295 =American rearguard action= alt=map Lee positioned himself with four guns supported by two infantry battalions on the crest of a hill to the right of Wayne. As the British advanced ‚Äì Guards on the right, Grenadiers on the left ‚Äì they passed the Point of Woods, oblivious to the Continentals concealed in them. Wayne's troops inflicted up to forty casualties. The Guards reacted as they were trained and with the support of the dragoons and some of the Grenadiers, crashed into the Americans at the charge. Within ten minutes, Wayne's three battalions were being chased back to the bridge. The rest of the Grenadiers, meanwhile, continued to advance on Lee's position, pushing the Continental artillery back to a hedgerow to which the two infantry battalions had already withdrawn. Another short, sharp fight ensued until Lee, seeing both flanks being turned, ordered his men to follow Wayne back across the bridge.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 298‚Äì310Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 208‚Äì209 As Lee and Wayne fought south of the Spotswood Middle Brook, Washington was deploying the main body on Perrine's Hill, northwest of the bridge across the brook. Stirling's wing had just taken up positions on the American left flank when its artillery started to engage troops of the British 3rd Brigade. Clinton had earlier ordered the brigade to move right, cross the brook and cut the vanguard's line of retreat at the bridge. After the infantry of the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot crossed the brook, they ran into three battalions of Scott's detachment retreating westwards. Under pressure from the Highlanders, the Continentals continued through an orchard to the safety of Stirling's line while Stirling's artillery forced the Highlanders back to the orchard. A second battalion of Highlanders and the 44th Regiment of Foot that had swung right and crossed the Spotswood North Brook were also persuaded by the artillery to retreat. Even farther to the right, an attempt to outflank Stirling's position by the Queen's Rangers and the light infantry of the rearguard lacked the strength to carry it through, and they too fell back to join the 3rd Brigade.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 274‚Äì276, 318 At 13:30, Lee was one of the last American officers to withdraw across Spotswood Middle Brook. The rearguard action had lasted no more than thirty minutes, enough time for Washington to complete the deployment of the main body. When a battalion of Grenadiers led by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Monckton chased Lee's troops over the bridge, the British found themselves facing Wayne's detachment reforming some away. As the Grenadiers advanced to engage Wayne they came under heavy fire from Stirling's artillery, another behind Wayne. Monckton became the highest-ranking British casualty of the day, and in the face of an unexpectedly strong enemy, the Grenadiers retreated back across the bridge to the hedgerow from which they had expelled Lee earlier.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 310‚Äì314 Washington had acted decisively to form a strong defensive position anchored on the right above the bridge on the Englishtown road and extending in a gentle curve up the slope of Perrine's Hill. When Lee joined it, Washington sent him with two battalions of Maxwell's New Jersey Brigade, around half of Scott's detachment and some other units of the former vanguard to form a reserve at Englishtown. The rest of the vanguard, which included the other half of Scott's detachment and most of Wayne's, remained with Washington.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 296‚Äì297, 315‚Äì316 The infantry battle gave way to a two-hour artillery duel across the of no-man's land on either side of the brook, in which both sides suffered more casualties due to heat exhaustion than they did from enemy cannon.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 318, 320, 322‚Äì324 =British withdrawal= alt=map Clinton had lost the initiative. He saw no prospect of success assaulting a strong enemy position in the brutal heat, and decided to break off the engagement.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 315, 331‚Äì332 His first task was to bring in his isolated right flank ‚Äì the 3rd Brigade, Rangers and light infantry still sheltering in the orchard north of Spotswood Middle Brook. While the Highlanders of the 42nd Regiment remained in place to cover the withdrawal, the remainder fell back across the brook to join the Grenadiers at the hedgerow. Around 15:45, while the withdrawal was in progress, Greene arrived with Woodford's brigade at Combs Hill overlooking the British left flank and opened fire with his artillery. Clinton was forced to withdraw his own artillery, bringing the cannonade with Washington's guns on Perrine's Hill to an end, and move the Grenadiers to sheltered ground at the north end of the hedgerow.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 333‚Äì335 At 16:30, Washington learned of 3rd Brigade's withdrawal and launched the first American offensive action in six hours. He ordered two battalions of picked men \\"to go and see what [you] could do with the enemy's right wing.\\"Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 336‚Äì337 Only one battalion some 350 strong led by Colonel Joseph Cilley actually made it into action. Cilley made good use of cover along the Spotswood North Brook to close with and engage the 275‚Äì325 troops of the 42nd Regiment in the orchard. The Highlanders found themselves in a disadvantageous position and, with the rest of British right flank already departed, they had no reason to stay. They conducted a fighting retreat in good order with minimal casualties. To the British, the rebels were \\"unsuccessful in endeavouring to annoy.\\" To the Americans, it was a significant psychological victory over one of the British Army's most feared regiments.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 335‚Äì340 As his right flank pulled back, Clinton issued orders for what he intended to be a phased general withdrawal back towards Monmouth Court House.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 340 His subordinates misunderstood. Instead of waiting until the 3rd Brigade had rejoined before pulling back, all but the 1st Grenadier Battalion withdrew immediately, leaving it and the 3rd Brigade dangerously exposed. Washington was buoyed by what he saw of Cilley's attack, and although he lacked specific intelligence about what the British were doing, the fact that their artillery had gone quiet suggested they might be vulnerable. He ordered Wayne to conduct an opportunistic advance with a detachment of Pennsylvanians.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 340‚Äì341 Wayne's request for three brigades, some 1,300 men, was denied, and at 16:45 he crossed the bridge over Spotswood Middle Brook with just 400 troops of the Third Pennsylvania Brigade. The Pennsylvanians caught the 650‚Äì700 men of the lone Grenadier battalion in the process of withdrawing, giving the British scant time to form up and receive the attack. The Grenadiers were \\"losing men very fast\\", Clinton wrote later, before the 33rd Regiment of Foot arrived with 300‚Äì350 men to support them. The British pushed back, and the Pennsylvanian Brigade began to disintegrate as it retreated to Parsonage farm. The longest infantry battle of the day ended when the Continental artillery on Combs Hill stopped the British counter-attack in its tracks and forced the Grenadiers and infantry to withdraw.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 341‚Äì347 Washington planned to resume the battle the next day, and at 18:00 he ordered four brigades he had previously sent back to the reserve at Englishtown to return. When they arrived, they took over Stirling's positions on Perrine's Hill, allowing Stirling to advance across the Spotswood Middle Brook and take up new positions near the hedgerow. An hour later, Washington ordered a reinforced brigade commanded by Brigadier General Enoch Poor to probe Clinton's right flank while Woodford's brigade was to drop down from Combs Hill and probe Clinton's left flank. Their cautious advance was halted by sunset before making contact with the British, and the two armies settled down for the night within of each other, the closest British troops at Ker's House.Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 347‚Äì349 While the battle was raging, Knyphausen had led the baggage train to safety. His second division endured only light harassment from militia along the way, and eventually set up camp some from Middletown. With the baggage train secure, Clinton had no intention of resuming the battle. At 23:00, he began withdrawing his troops. The first division slipped away unnoticed by Washington's forward troops and, after an overnight march, linked back up with Knyphausen's second division between 08:00 and 09:00 the next morning.Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 349‚Äì352 Aftermath alt=Scan of engraving On June 29, Washington withdrew his army to Englishtown, where they rested the next day. The British were in a strong position near Middletown, and their route to Sandy Hook was secure. They completed the march largely untroubled by a militia that considered the threat to have passed and had melted away to tend to crops. The last British troops embarked on naval transports on July 6, and the Royal Navy carried Clinton's army to New York. The timing was fortuitous for the British; on July 11, a superior French fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing anchored off Sandy Hook.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 354‚Äì355, 372‚Äì373, 378‚Äì379 The battle was tactically inconclusive and strategically irrelevant; neither side dealt a heavy blow to the other, and the Continental Army remained in the field while the British Army redeployed to New York, just as both would have if the battle had never been fought.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xiii, 382 Clinton reported 358 total casualties after the battle ‚Äì 65 killed, 59 died of fatigue, 170 wounded and 64 missing. Washington counted some 250 British dead, a figure later revised to a little over 300. Using a typical 18th-century wounded-to-killed ratio of no more than four to one and assuming no more than 160 British dead caused by enemy fire, Lender and Stone calculate the number of wounded could have been up to 640. A Monmouth County Historical Association study estimates total British casualties at 1,134 ‚Äì comprising 304 dead, 770 wounded and 60 prisoners. Washington reported his own casualties to be 370 ‚Äì comprising 69 dead, 161 wounded and 140 missing. Using the same wounded-to-killed ratio and assuming a proportion of the missing were fatalities, Lender and Stone estimate Washington's casualties could have exceeded 500.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 366‚Äì369Martin 1993 pp. 232‚Äì233 =Claims of victory= In his post-battle report to Lord George Germain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Clinton claimed he had conducted a successful operation to redeploy his army in the face of a superior force. The counter-attack was, he reported, a diversion intended to protect the baggage train and was ended on his own terms, though in private correspondence he conceded that he had also hoped to inflict a decisive defeat on Washington.Bilby & Jenkins 2010 p. 232 Having marched his army through the heart of enemy territory without the loss of a single wagon, he congratulated his officers on the \\"long and difficult retreat in the face of a greatly superior army without being tarnished by the smallest affront.\\" While some of his officers showed a grudging respect for the Continental Army, their doubts were rooted not in the battlefield but in the realisation that the entry of France into the conflict had swung the strategic balance against Great Britain.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xii, 375‚Äì378 For Washington, the battle was fought at a time of serious misgivings about his effectiveness as commander-in-chief, and it was politically important for him to present it as a victory.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. xiii‚Äìxiv, 382‚Äì383 On July 1, in his first significant communication to Congress from the front since the disappointments of the previous year, he wrote a full report of the battle. The contents were measured but unambiguous in claiming a significant win, a rare occasion on which the British had left the battlefield and their wounded to the Americans. Congress received it enthusiastically and voted a formal thanks to Washington and the army to honor \\"the important victory of Monmouth over the British grand army.\\"Lander & Stone 2016 pp. 349, 353, 383‚Äì384 In their accounts of the battle, Washington's officers invariably wrote of a major victory, and some took the opportunity to finally put an end to criticism of Washington; Hamilton and Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens, another of Washington's aides, wrote to influential friends ‚Äì in the case of Laurens, his father Henry, President of the Continental Congress ‚Äì praising Washington's leadership. The American press portrayed the battle as a triumph with Washington at its center. Governor William Livingston of New Jersey, who never came any nearer to Monmouth Court House during the campaign than Trenton, almost away, published an anonymous 'eyewitness' account in the New Jersey Gazette only days after the battle, in which he credited the victory to Washington. Articles were still being published in a similar vein in August.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 309, 384‚Äì389 Congressional delegates who were not Washington partisans, such as Samuel Adams and James Lovell, were reluctant to credit Washington but obliged to recognize the importance of the battle and keep to themselves any questions they might have had about the British success in reaching New York. The Washington loyalist Elias Boudinot wrote that \\"none dare to acknowledge themselves his Enemies.\\"Lender & Stone 2016 p. 386 Washington's supporters were emboldened in defending his reputation; in July, Major General John Cadwalader challenged Conway, the officer at the center of what Washington had perceived to be a conspiracy to remove him as commander- in-chief, to a duel in Philadelphia in which Conway was wounded in the mouth. Thomas McKean, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, was perhaps the only congressional delegate to register his disapproval of the affair, but did not think it wise to bring Cadwalader up before the court to answer for it.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 387‚Äì388Chernow 2010 p. 423 Faith in Washington had been restored, Congress became almost deferential to him, public criticism of him all but ceased and for the first time he was hailed as the Father of his Country. The epithet became commonplace by the end of the year, by which time the careers of most of his chief critics had been eclipsed or were in ruins.Lander & Stone 2016 p. 390Ferling 2009 pp. 173, 182Longmore 1988 p. 208 =Lee's court martial= alt=Late 19th century drawing Even before the day was out, Lee was cast in the role of villain, and his vilification became an integral part of the narrative Washington's lieutenants constructed when they wrote in praise of their commander-in-chief.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 391‚Äì392 Lee continued in his post as second-in-command immediately after the battle, and it is likely that the issue would have simply subsided if he had let it go. But on June 30, after protesting his innocence to all who would listen, Lee wrote an insolent letter to Washington in which he blamed \\"dirty earwigs\\" for turning Washington against him, claimed his decision to retreat had saved the day and pronounced Washington to be \\"guilty of an act of cruel injustice\\" towards him. Instead of the apology Lee was tactlessly seeking, Washington replied that the tone of Lee's letter was \\"highly improper\\" and that he would initiate an official inquiry into Lee's conduct. Lee's response demanding a court-martial was again insolent; Washington ordered his arrest and set about obliging him.Ferling 2009 p. 180Chernow 2010 p. 452Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 392‚Äì393 The court convened on July 4, and three charges were laid before Lee: disobeying orders in not attacking on the morning of the battle, contrary to \\"repeated instructions\\"; conducting an \\"unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat\\"; and disrespect towards the commander-in-chief. The trial concluded on August 12, but the accusations and counter-accusations continued until the verdict was confirmed by Congress on December 5.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 395‚Äì396, 400 Lee's defense was articulate but fatally flawed by his efforts to turn it into a personal contest between himself and Washington. He denigrated the commander-in-chief's role in the battle, calling Washington's official account \\"from beginning to end a most abominable damn'd lie\\", and disingenuously cast his own decision to retreat as a \\"masterful manoeuvre\\" designed to lure the British onto the main body.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 396, 397, 399 Washington remained aloof from the controversy, but his allies portrayed Lee as a traitor who had allowed the British to escape and linked him to the previous winter's alleged conspiracy against Washington.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 397‚Äì399 Although the first two charges proved to be dubious, Lee was undeniably guilty of disrespect, and Washington was too powerful to cross.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 396 As the historian John Shy noted, \\"Under the circumstances, an acquittal on the first two charges would have been a vote of no-confidence in Washington.\\"Shy 1973, cited in Lender & Stone 2016, p. 396 Lee was found guilty on all three counts, though the court deleted \\"shameful\\" from the second and noted the retreat was \\"disorderly\\" only \\"in some few instances.\\" Lee was suspended from the army for a year, a sentence so lenient that some interpreted it as a vindication of all but the charge of disrespect.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 396‚Äì397 Lee's fall from grace removed Washington's last significant critic from the army and the last realistic alternative to Washington as commander-in-chief, and silenced the last voice to speak in favor of a militia army. Washington's position as the \\"indispensable man\\" was now unassailable.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 403 =Assessing the Continental Army= Joseph Bilby and Katherine Jenkins consider the battle to have marked the \\"coming of age\\" of a Continental Army that had previously achieved success only in small actions at Trenton and Princeton.Bilby & Jenkins 2010 pp. 233, 237 Their view is reflected by Joseph Ellis, who writes of Washington's belief that \\"the Continental Army was now a match for British professionals and could hold its own in a conventional, open-field engagement.\\"Ellis 2004 p. 120 Mark Lender and Garry Stone point out that while the Continental Army was unquestionably improved under Steuben's tutelage, the battle did not test its ability to meet a professional European army in European-style warfare in which brigades and divisions maneuvered against each other. The only army to mount any major offensive operation on the day was British; the Continental Army fought a largely defensive battle from cover, and a significant portion of it remained out of the fray on Perrine's Hill. The few American attacks, such as Cilley's, were small-unit actions.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 405‚Äì406 Steuben's influence was apparent in the way the rank and file conducted themselves. Half of the troops who marched onto the battlefield at Monmouth in June were new to the army, having been recruited only since January. The significant majority of Lee's vanguard comprised ad hoc battalions filled with men picked from numerous regiments. Without any inherent unit cohesion, their effectiveness depended on officers and men who had never before served together using and following the drills they had been taught. That they did so competently was demonstrated throughout the battle, in the advance to contact, Wayne's repulse of the dragoons, the orderly retreat in the face of a strong counter-attack and Cilley's attack on the Highlanders. The army was well served too by the artillery, which earned high praise from Washington.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 407‚Äì408 The professional conduct of the American troops gained widespread recognition even among the British; Clinton's secretary wrote, \\"the Rebels stood much better than ever they did\\", and Brigadier General Sir William Erskine, who as commander of the light infantry had traded blows with the Continentals, characterized the battle as a \\"handsome flogging\\" for the British, adding, \\"We had not receiv'd such an one in America.\\"Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 375, 405 Legacy A tall monument to the battle in front of the Monmouth County Courthouse in Freehold In keeping with a battle that was more politically than militarily significant, the first reenactment in 1828 was staged to support the presidential candidacy of Andrew Jackson. In another attempt to reenact the battle in 1854, the weather added an authentic touch to the proceedings and the reenactment was called off due to the excessive heat. As the battle receded into history so too did its brutality, to be replaced by a sanitized romanticism. The public memory of the fighting was populated with dramatic images of heroism and glory, as epitomized by Emanuel Leutze's Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth. The transformation was aided by the inventiveness of 19th-century historians, none more creative than Washington's step-grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, whose account of the battle was as artistic as Leutze's painting. Custis was inevitably derogatory towards Lee, and Lee's calumny achieved an orthodoxy in such works as Washington Irving's Life of George Washington (1855‚Äì1859) and George Bancroft's History of the United States of America, from the Discovery of the American Continent (1854‚Äì1878). The role Lee had unsuccessfully advanced for the militia in the revolution was finally established in the poetic 19th-century popular narrative, in which the Continental Army was excised from the battle and replaced with patriotic citizen-soldiers.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 429‚Äì436 The battlefield remained largely undisturbed until 1853, when the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad opened a line that cut through the Point of Woods, across the Spotswood Middle Brook and through the Perrine estate. The area became popular with tourists, and the Parsonage, the site of Wayne's desperate battle with the Grenadiers and the 33rd Regiment, was a favorite attraction until it was demolished in 1860.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 432‚Äì433 During the 19th century, forests were cleared and marshes drained, and by the early 20th century traditional agriculture had been replaced by orchards and truck farms. In 1884, the Monmouth Battle Monument was dedicated outside the modern-day county courthouse in Freehold, near where Wayne's troops first brushed with the British rearguard.Lender & Stone 2016 p. 437 In the mid 20th century, two battlefield farms were sold to builders, but before the land could be developed, lobbying by state officials, Monmouth County citizens, the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Monmouth County Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution succeeded in initiating a program of preservation. In 1963, the first tract of battlefield land came under state ownership with the purchase of a 200-acre farm. The Monmouth Battlefield State Park was dedicated on the bicentennial of the battle in 1978 and a new visitor center was opened in 2013. By 2015, the park encompassed over 1,800 acres, incorporating most of the land on which the afternoon battle was fought. The state park helped restore a more realistic interpretation of the history of the battle to the public memory, and the Continental Army takes its rightful place in the annual reenactments staged every June.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 438‚Äì439 =Legend of Molly Pitcher= Five days after the battle, a surgeon treating the wounded reported a patient's story of a woman who had taken her husband's place working a gun after he was incapacitated. Two accounts attributed to veterans of the battle that surfaced decades later also speak of the actions of a woman during the battle; in one she supplied ammunition to the guns, in the other she brought water to the crews. The story gained prominence during the 19th century and became embellished as the legend of Molly Pitcher. The woman behind Molly Pitcher is most often identified as Mary Ludwig Hays, whose husband William served with the Pennsylvania State Artillery, but it is likely that the legend is an amalgam of more than one woman seen on the battlefield that day; it was not unusual for camp followers to assist in 18th-century battles, though more plausibly in carrying ammunition and water than crewing the guns. Late 20th-century research identified a site near Stirling's artillery line as the location of a well from which the legendary Molly drew water, and a historic marker was placed there in 1992.Lender & Stone 2016 pp. 326‚Äì330Martin 1993 pp. 228‚Äì229 See also *List of American Revolutionary War battles *New Jersey in the American Revolution Footnotes References Bibliography    * Further reading External links *Monmouth Battlefield: Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings *Monmouth County Historical Association: Coll. 72 Battle of Monmouth Collection 1778 in New Jersey 1778 in the United States Conflicts in 1778 Freehold Borough, New Jersey Monmouth Monmouth Monmouth ","title":"Battle of Monmouth"},{"id":"241431","text":"The chirp Z-transform (CZT) is a generalization of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). While the DFT samples the Z plane at uniformly-spaced points along the unit circle, the chirp Z-transform samples along spiral arcs in the Z-plane, corresponding to straight lines in the S plane.A study of the Chirp Z-transform and its applications - Shilling, Steve Alan The DFT, real DFT, and zoom DFT can be calculated as special cases of the CZT. Specifically, the chirp Z transform calculates the Z transform at a finite number of points zk along a logarithmic spiral contour, defined as: :X_k = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) z_{k}^{-n} :z_k = A\\\\cdot W^{-k}, k=0,1,\\\\dots,M-1 where A is the complex starting point, W is the complex ratio between points, and M is the number of points to calculate. Like the DFT, the chirp Z-transform can be computed in O(n log n) operations where n = \\\\max(M, N). An O(N log N) algorithm for the inverse chirp Z-transform (ICZT) was described in 2003, and in 2019.Engineers Solve 50-Year-Old Puzzle in Signal Processing ‚Äì Inverse Chirp Z-Transform, By IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY OCTOBER 10, 2019 Bluestein's algorithm Bluestein's algorithm expresses the CZT as a convolution and implements it efficiently using FFT/IFFT. As the DFT is a special case of the CZT, this allows the efficient calculation of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of arbitrary sizes, including prime sizes. (The other algorithm for FFTs of prime sizes, Rader's algorithm, also works by rewriting the DFT as a convolution.) It was conceived in 1968 by Leo Bluestein. Bluestein's algorithm can be used to compute more general transforms than the DFT, based on the (unilateral) z-transform (Rabiner et al., 1969). Recall that the DFT is defined by the formula : X_k = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N} nk } \\\\qquad k = 0,\\\\dots,N-1. If we replace the product nk in the exponent by the identity :n k = \\\\frac{-(k-n)^2}{2} + \\\\frac{n^2}{2} + \\\\frac{k^2}{2} we thus obtain: : X_k = e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{N} k^2 } \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\\\left( x_n e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{N} n^2 } \\\\right) e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{N} (k-n)^2 } \\\\qquad k = 0,\\\\dots,N-1. This summation is precisely a convolution of the two sequences an and bn defined by: :a_n = x_n e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{N} n^2 } :b_n = e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{N} n^2 }, with the output of the convolution multiplied by N phase factors bk*. That is: :X_k = b_k^* \\\\left(\\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_n b_{k-n}\\\\right) \\\\qquad k = 0,\\\\dots,N-1. This convolution, in turn, can be performed with a pair of FFTs (plus the pre- computed FFT of complex chirp bn) via the convolution theorem. The key point is that these FFTs are not of the same length N: such a convolution can be computed exactly from FFTs only by zero-padding it to a length greater than or equal to 2N-1\\\\. In particular, one can pad to a power of two or some other highly composite size, for which the FFT can be efficiently performed by e.g. the Cooley‚ÄìTukey algorithm in O(N log N) time. Thus, Bluestein's algorithm provides an O(N log N) way to compute prime-size DFTs, albeit several times slower than the Cooley‚ÄìTukey algorithm for composite sizes. The use of zero- padding for the convolution in Bluestein's algorithm deserves some additional comment. Suppose we zero-pad to a length M ‚â• 2N-1\\\\. This means that an is extended to an array An of length M, where An = an for 0 ‚â§ n < N and An = 0 otherwise--the usual meaning of \\"zero-padding\\". However, because of the bk-n term in the convolution, both positive and negative values of n are required for bn (noting that b-n = bn). The periodic boundaries implied by the DFT of the zero-padded array mean that -n is equivalent to M-n. Thus, bn is extended to an array Bn of length M, where B0 = b0, Bn = BM-n = bn for 0 < n < N, and Bn = 0 otherwise. A and B are then FFTed, multiplied pointwise, and inverse FFTed to obtain the convolution of a and b, according to the usual convolution theorem. Let us also be more precise about what type of convolution is required in Bluestein's algorithm for the DFT. If the sequence bn were periodic in n with period N, then it would be a cyclic convolution of length N, and the zero-padding would be for computational convenience only. However, this is not generally the case: :b_{n+N} = e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{N} (n+N)^2 } = b_n \\\\left[ e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{N} (2Nn+N^2) } \\\\right] = (-1)^N b_n . Therefore, for N even the convolution is cyclic, but in this case N is composite and one would normally use a more efficient FFT algorithm such as Cooley‚ÄìTukey. For N odd, however, then bn is antiperiodic and we technically have a negacyclic convolution of length N. Such distinctions disappear when one zero-pads an to a length of at least 2N‚àí1 as described above, however. It is perhaps easiest, therefore, to think of it as a subset of the outputs of a simple linear convolution (i.e. no conceptual \\"extensions\\" of the data, periodic or otherwise).  z-transforms  Bluestein's algorithm can also be used to compute a more general transform based on the (unilateral) z-transform (Rabiner et al., 1969). In particular, it can compute any transform of the form: : X_k = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n z^{nk} \\\\qquad k = 0,\\\\dots,M-1, for an arbitrary complex number z and for differing numbers N and M of inputs and outputs. Given Bluestein's algorithm, such a transform can be used, for example, to obtain a more finely spaced interpolation of some portion of the spectrum (although the frequency resolution is still limited by the total sampling time, similar to a Zoom FFT), enhance arbitrary poles in transfer- function analyses, etc. The algorithm was dubbed the chirp z-transform algorithm because, for the Fourier-transform case (z = 1), the sequence bn from above is a complex sinusoid of linearly increasing frequency, which is called a (linear) chirp in radar systems.

Jones, born Richard Marigny Jones (sometimes written Richard Mariney Jones), (13 June 1892 ‚Äì 8 December 1945) was a jazz pianist, composer, band leader, and record producer. Numerous songs bear his name as author, including \\"Trouble in Mind\\". Jones grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana. Jones suffered from a stiff leg and walked with a limp; fellow musicians gave him the nickname \\"Richard My Knee Jones\\" as a pun on his middle name. In his youth he played alto horn in brass bands. His main instrument, however, became the piano. By 1908 he was playing in Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans. A few years later, he often led a small band which sometimes included Joe Oliver. Jones also worked in the bands of John Robichaux, Armand J. Piron, and Papa Celestin. In 1918 Jones moved to Chicago. He worked as Chicago manager for publisher and pianist Clarence Williams. Jones began recording in 1923, making gramophone records as a piano soloist, accompanist to vocalists, and with his bands The Jazz Wizards and The Chicago Cosmopolitans. He recorded for Gennett, OKeh, Victor, and Paramount Records in the 1920s. He also worked for OKeh Records as Chicago supervisor of the company's \\"Race\\" (African- American) Records for most of the decade. During this period he was the producer of the very influential Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings led by cornetist (later trumpeter) Louis Armstrong, the most important soloist in early jazz.

It was directed by Alfred Sole and featured an ensemble cast including Eileen Brennan, Phil Hartman, Tab Hunter, Carol Kane, David Lander, Eve Arden, Paul Reubens, and Tom Smothers. The film went into production under the working title of Thursday the 12th. It was the last feature in which Arden appeared and also the last feature film Sole directed in his career. Plot In the fictional town of It Had To Be, Indiana, fullback Blue Grange scores the winning touchdown for It Had To Be University in the 1963 National Championship game. Afterwards, a shunned cheerleader named Bambi is seen fawning over Grange's locker before the on- field celebration pours into the locker room. As a group of cheerleaders are cleaning up the field after the game, all five are skewered with a javelin thrown by an unknown assailant. The bizarre murder makes headlines, as does a subsequent murder involving exploding pompons. As a result, the college's summer cheerleading camp is closed down. In 1982, the camp reopens with Bambi as the instructor. After arriving on campus, she meets Pepe the maintenance man and his mother Salt. Both warn her against reopening the camp as they believe it to be cursed with death, but Bambi is undeterred. At a bus station, a young woman named Candy (labeled Victim #1) prepares to board a bus to the cheerleading camp but her religious fanatic mother tries to dissuade her. As they quarrel, red beams of light suddenly streak from Candy's eyes and levitate her mother into the air. As she hangs suspended, Candy tells her that she just wants to be normal and marches away to catch the bus. In another part of town, a male cheerleader named Glenn Dandy (Victim #2) says goodbye to his unconventional family before leaving for camp. Next, Mandy (Victim #3) is introduced by her father in a beauty pageant-style interview, revealing her obsession with dental hygiene. Sandy (Victim #4) asks for directions to the camp at a food truck and decides to hitchhike, but insists on getting references from every driver she passes (eventually accepting a ride with then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan). Andy and Randy (Victims #5 and #6 respectively), two lecherous cheerleaders, are shown smoking marijuana while driving to the camp. The cheerleaders assemble at the camp and are greeted by Bambi. Meanwhile, a Mountie named Sgt. Reginald Cooper makes a phone call to Warden June to express his concerns about the new cheerleading camp. He also learns of an escaped convict named Jarrett who murdered his entire family with a hand drill and turned them into bookshelves. Cooper then leaves the station in the care of his ill-tempered assistant Johnson to visit the Indiana State Asylum, where he inquires about another recent escapee named Fletcher, with whom Jarrett ends up hitching a ride to the college. The cheerleaders begin training, unaware that they are being stalked by a mysterious figure on campus. Cooper then arrives to meet the cheerleaders and quickly falls in love with Candy, singing a duet with her. Inspired, Glenn dresses in a tuxedo and attempts to woo Mandy, but fails to catch her during a routine practice drill and she injures her ankle. Bambi calls off practice for the day, but while the others go out to eat, a guilty Glenn stays in the gym to continue practicing and is killed when the mysterious figure rigs the trampoline with dynamite. While recovering in her dorm room, Mandy is brushing her teeth with copious amounts of toothpaste when the mystery man bursts through her medicine cabinet and kills her with a hand drill. Back at the police station, Cooper receives a call from Warden June who tells him that Jarrett has been spotted at a cemetery and museum called Lover's Lane. He and Johnson leave to investigate and find the wrecked car Fletcher was driving, and meet Dr. Fuller from the asylum who is looking for Fletcher. Alerted by a scream inside the museum, Cooper and Johnson interrupt Jarrett before he can murder Fletcher. They are shocked to discover that Jarrett and Dr. Fuller are working together in a scheme to create and sell furniture made from their victims' bodies, but both deny harming any cheerleaders. Suddenly, Fletcher rises up and drives a butcher knife into Jarrett's mechanical arm, electrocuting all three men. Nevertheless, the slayings continue on campus. Bambi is enjoying a bath of milk and cookies when the killer reappears and drowns her. After a game of strip poker, Randy, Andy, and Sandy are killed in succession, and a panicked Candy discovers all the bodies before being stalked by the killer herself. She flees into the locker room where the killer reveals himself as Blue Grange, who secretly wanted to be a cheerleader instead of a football star and began murdering cheerleaders out of angst. Candy escapes onto the football field and uses her eye beams to run down Grange with a giant statue of himself, killing him. Cooper arrives to sweep Candy onto his horse named Bob and they happily ride off the field together.

Rogers and written by Adam Herz and David H. Steinberg from a story by Herz. A sequel to the 1999 comedy film American Pie, it is the second film in the American Pie series and stars Jason Biggs, Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Seann William Scott, Mena Suvari, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Eugene Levy. The film follows the sexual exploits of five friends‚ÄîJim, Kevin, Stifler, Oz, and Finch‚Äîand their attempts to have the greatest summer party ever, at a summer beach house in Grand Haven, Michigan. American Pie 2 was released in the United States on August 10, 2001, and grossed over $145 million in the US and $142 million overseas on a budget of $30 million, making it highest-grossing film in the franchise at just under $288 million worldwide. The film was followed by American Wedding. Plot After their freshman year at college, the four friends regroup for a party held by Stifler, their overtly sex-crazed class clown and good friend. His party is shut down in part to the neighbors calling the police. Kevin is inspired by his brother to make his summer with his friends count by renting a beach home. He, Jim, Oz, and Finch plan to take off to a beach house together, where they intend to spend the summer. Kevin realizes a problem and worked out that they can only afford the house if they have a fifth member to work along with them. Stifler takes charge of much of the organizing, often ending up leading the group in their misadventures. Oz is miserable, being away from his girlfriend Heather, who is in Spain. During the stay at the beach house, they proceed to start having phone sex to vent some of their loneliness, which ends up being interrupted by Stifler. Heather later shows up early to the party, ending the short storyline that Oz is involved in. After arriving in Grand Harbor they settle in, they manage to find work painting a house (based on the Tuition Painters franchise) in the area together, mistaking the owners for lesbians. Jim, Stifler and Finch end up performing \\"like for like\\" sexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls doing the same thing. Oz and Kevin take turns watching up a ladder and listening on the walkie-talkie also in the room. The conversation is accidentally picked up and heard by many other people in the neighborhood. Finally at the end of the last party, Stifler manages to have a wild threesome with the owners of the house. After this, many concurrent stories run at the same time, some interacting with each other, others staying mainly separate. Nadia is coming to visit Jim in August. When she arrives early, Jim asks for help from band geek Michelle, humiliating himself in front of the audience when he pretends to be Petey, a mentally challenged boy who plays the trombone. They pretend to be in a relationship so that Nadia will not expect Jim to have sex (Jim is involved in an incident involving a tube of super glue he mistook for lube; he accidentally glued his hand to his penis while watching a porno film and injured himself, leaving him wounded and unable to perform). Jim and Michelle break the mock relationship off once he is ready to have sex with Nadia, but by then Michelle has really fallen in love with Jim, and soon Jim realizes that he has found his soul-mate in Michelle. Nadia also realizes this and tells him, \\"Go, get your band geek, and I will find mine\\". Jim goes and plays the trombone once more whilst Michelle is playing the flute at a major recital in order to show her that she is the one he wants to be with. Finch has become involved in the sexual art of Tantra, and claims that through Tantra he can \\"make an orgasm last for days\\". He is waiting for Stifler's Mom, who he had sex with in the first film, hoping she will show up and be willing to do it again. He thinks she arrives when a vehicle turns up after Stifler is talking on the phone, but it turns out to be his younger brother. He spends the night talking with a few girls, but he doesn't sleep with any of them. The geeky Sherman gives up on getting anyone after he is turned down by the experienced and sharp-tongued Jessica, but the rejected Nadia, who wanted Jim because he was a geek, is turned on by his \\"Sherminator\\" gimmick, and they end up in bed together. Kevin doesn't end up \\"getting off\\" with anyone, but he does seem to succeed in getting over Vicky after making advances on her throughout the film. The next morning, after the party, a Mercedes-Benz coupe with darkened windows turns up, Finch approaches and it turns out Stifler's Mom has come after all. He jumps at the chance and they drive off together, Stifler not realizing until after the car has driven off that it was Finch and his mother. After being asked, she reveals her name is Jeanine, but also instructs Finch to resume calling her \\"Stifler's mom\\" as per usual.

It is the third (originally intended final) installment in the American Pie theatrical series. It was written by Adam Herz and directed by Jesse Dylan. Another sequel, American Reunion, was released nine years later. This stands as the last film in the series to be written by Herz, who conceptualized the franchise, and also the only film in the series that does not star Chris Klein, who plays Oz. The film's main plot focuses on the wedding ceremony of Jim Levenstein and Michelle Flaherty, and a subplot centers on Steve Stifler, and his outrageous antics including his attempt to organize a bachelor party, teaching Jim to dance for the wedding, and competing with Finch to win the heart of Michelle's sister, Cadence. Plot While on a date in a fancy restaurant with Michelle Flaherty, Jim Levenstein is ready to propose to her. Jim's dad calls to inform him that he has the ring. Michelle misinterprets when Jim stalls the question. Jim's dad arrives as Jim is receiving fellatio, and a mishap grasps the restaurant's attention. Jim proposes and Michelle accepts. Jim wants to exclude Steve Stifler from the wedding, having concerns that Stifler's behavior is not socially acceptable. When Jim is worried about learning to dance, Stifler agrees to teach him. Jim also asks Stifler to tone down his obnoxious personality, in exchange that he be allowed to attend the wedding and host a bachelor party. The boys go on a road trip when they discover there is only one designer who makes the dress that Michelle wants. They go to Chicago looking for \\"Leslie Summers\\"; Stifler unwittingly walks into a gay bar, and his raucous behavior gets him into a dispute with several patrons. Stifler challenges one of these patrons, Bear, to a dance-off. Stifler wins, and Bear offers to provide strippers for the bachelor party. Leslie reveals himself and agrees to make the dress for Michelle and hits on Kevin Myers, who is uncomfortable with the unrequited attention. Michelle's parents, who were initially skeptical of Jim, agree to have a preliminary dinner with him. Michelle's younger sister, Cadence, flies in for the wedding. Both Paul Finch and Stifler are attracted to her, and in an effort to win her over, they each adopt the other's personality and mannerisms. Stifler arranges the bachelor party, including strippers, for everyone at Jim's house except Jim, who unknowingly has arranged dinner with Michelle's parents there. The party is abruptly halted by the unexpected return of the three. With assistance from Bear, who poses as a butler named \\"Mr. Belvedere\\", Jim nearly succeeds in keeping the activities a secret, until Michelle's mother opens a closet door and is shocked to find Kevin inside, stripped to his boxers and tied to a chair. The boys explain that it was an attempt to make Jim seem like a hero that went wrong, and Michelle's parents accept this and tell him that if he puts that much effort into the upcoming marriage, they can give their blessing. Michelle is concerned that Jim's paternal grandmother may dislike her for not being Jewish. She is also concerned about Stifler having been invited to the wedding. On the night before the wedding, Stifler inadvertently disrupts the walk-in refrigerator's power supply while retrieving a bottle of champagne in an attempt to seduce Cadence. Previously, Stifler‚Äîunaware of Cadence's presence‚Äîhad revealed his true rude and obnoxious personality. When Stifler later returns, the flowers are dead. Jim asks him to leave, and all the others, including Cadence, support Jim's decision. Feeling guilty for his thoughtless behavior, Stifler convinces the florist to put together a new batch of flowers, and he enlists the help of his football players and Bear. As a gesture of remorse, he also gives a rose to Cadence, much to the amazement of Jim and Michelle. Moved by his actions, Cadence agrees to have sex with him in a supply closet before the ceremony, but Stifler's presence is delayed by a brief thank-you meeting Jim calls among his groomsmen, citing how he is grateful to have friends like them to back him up. Quickly returning to the hotel, Stifler hears someone in the supply closet and steps inside, unaware that Cadence was interrupted by wedding preparations and that the ushers, the MILF guys from high school, placed Jim's grandmother in that closet to sustain her hostility about the wedding; Stifler only realizes this upon walk-in by Finch and Kevin. She becomes pleasant, particularly towards Stifler, making Michelle and Jim's dad unknowingly happy. Despite the chaotic events leading up to it, Michelle and Jim get married. At the reception, the couple dances while Stifler dances with Cadence. Finch is sitting by himself when Stifler's mom arrives. Although agreeing they are over each other, Stifler's mom mentions having a double suite and invites Finch to join her. The film ends with the MILF guys spying on Stifler's mom and Finch in her suite's couple-size bathtub, having oral sex. Cast Soundtrack The film's soundtrack includes songs by Van Morrison, Blue October, The Working Title, Foo Fighters, Feeder, Avril Lavigne, American Hi-Fi, Sum 41, the All-American Rejects, Joseph Arthur, New Found Glory, and Hot Action Cop. Badly Drawn Boy and The Libertines also have songs in the feature. Note that most songs used were already singles. And, this is the first film to feature the song \\"Laid\\" (Matt Nathanson covering the band James) in both the trailers and the opening sequence. Notably, it is also the only film in the series to not play the song \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" in a scene where Finch has sex with Stifler's mother. It is also the first of the American Pie films not to feature a blink-182 song. The song \\"Into the Mystic\\", played at the end of the film when Jim and Michelle take to the dance floor at the reception, begins as Van Morrison's recording, but midway through it changes to The Wallflowers' cover version due to licensing reasons. The band's lead singer Jakob Dylan is the brother of the film's director Jesse Dylan. The film's soundtrack peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200 chart. Songs that appear during Stifler's dance in the gay bar: * \\"Beat It\\" - Michael Jackson (only few seconds) * \\"Maniac\\" - Michael Sembello * \\"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\\" - Belinda Carlisle * \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\" - Eurythmics * \\"Venus\\" - Bananarama * \\"The Reflex\\" - Duran Duran Songs that appear during the bachelor party: *\\"Summertime Girls\\" - Y&T; *\\"Freakin you baby\\" - \\"Jungle Brothers\\" Release American Wedding was released in the United States on August 1, 2003 and opened at #1 with $33,369,440 before dropping 53.7% the next weekend, landing at #3 behind the new releases of S.W.A.T. and Freaky Friday.

Despite being a huge box office success, it is the lowest-grossing film in the series, making roughly $3 million less than American Reunion would in 2012. American Wedding grossed $15.85 million on DVD and was the number seven DVD rental in 2004. Reception American Wedding received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, assigns the film a rating of 54%, based on 155 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.

Robert Koeler of Variety compared it to the works of John Waters and called it a \\"strong finish\\" for the franchise. Roger Ebert rated it 3/4 stars and wrote that the film \\"is proof of the hypothesis that no genre is beyond redemption.\\" Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"struggles so hard to be tasteless that it's almost quaint.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle rated it 2/5 stars and called it strained and desperate to find jokes. =Awards= ;Wins * 2004 - MTV Movie Award for Best Dance Sequence (Seann William Scott) * 2004 - Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Villain (Seann William Scott) and Choice Movie Your Parents Didn't Want You To See ;Nominations * 2004 - Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie ‚Äì Comedy, Choice Movie Actor ‚Äì Comedy (Seann William Scott), Choice Movie Actress ‚Äì Comedy (Alyson Hannigan), Choice Movie Blush (Seann William Scott), Choice Movie Hissy Fit (Jason Biggs), & Choice Movie Liplock (Jason Biggs & Alyson Hannigan) References External links  American Pie (film series) 2003 films 2003 comedy films 2003 romantic comedy films 2000s sex comedy films American films American romantic comedy films American sequel films American sex comedy films English-language films Films scored by Christophe Beck Films directed by Jesse Dylan Films set in Michigan Films shot in California Films shot in Chicago Films set in 2003 Films about weddings American interfaith romance films Films with screenplays by Adam Herz Universal Pictures films ","title":"American Wedding"},{"id":"241483","text":"Sidereal, meaning \\"of the stars\\", may refer to: * Sidereal time * Sidereal day * Sidereal month * Sidereal year * Sidereal period of an object orbiting a star * Sidereal and tropical astrology ","title":"Sidereal"},{"id":"241484","text":"Flaccus was a cognomen of the ancient Roman plebeian family Fulvius, considered one of the most illustrious gentes of the city.

Cianci was the longest-serving mayor of Providence and one of the longest-serving mayors in United States history, having held office for over 21 years. Cianci was twice elected Mayor of Providence. Earlier in his career he served as a state prosecutor in the Rhode Island Department of Attorney General. Cianci was forced to resign from office during both mayoral tenures due to felony convictions. His first administration ended in 1984 when he pleaded nolo contendere to charges brought against him involving kidnapping and torturing a man Cianci believed was romantically involved with his ex-wife. His second stint as mayor ended when he was forced to resign following his conviction for one count of racketeering conspiracy, and he served four years in federal prison. Cianci was first elected mayor as the candidate of the Republican Party. While in office, he declared himself an independent and, , he said that he had no party affiliation. On his radio show in June 2014, Cianci announced that he would run for mayor again. He was defeated by Democratic candidate Jorge Elorza in the 2014 election. Family and personal life Cianci was born on April 30, 1941, in Providence, Rhode Island. His family lived in the Laurel Hill section of nearby Cranston, Rhode Island. Cianci was the younger child of Dr. Vincent Albert Cianci and Esther Cianci, n√©e Capobianco (whose great-grandfather served as mayor of Benevento, Italy) who married in 1937. His only marriage, in 1973, was to Sheila Bentley McKenna; the couple divorced in 1983. They had one daughter, Nicole, who died in 2012. Shortly before dying in early 2016, the 74-year-old Cianci announced his engagement to model and actress Tara Marie Haywood, then in her 30s. =Education and military service= At the age of seven, Cianci began appearing regularly on WJAR's Kiddie Revue Sunday radio broadcast from the Outlet Department Store on Weybosset Street, downtown Providence. After briefly attending public school, Cianci enrolled in Moses Brown School, a private school on the east-side of Providence. There he became the roommate of Adrian Hendricks, the first black student to attend the prestigious school. Later, Cianci would earn a bachelor's degree in government at Fairfield University. Later, Cianci earned a master's degree in Political Science at Villanova University and a Juris Doctor at Marquette University Law School in 1966. Cianci also held honorary doctorates awarded by Fairfield University (his alma mater), Johnson & Wales University, Roger Williams University, and, most recently, from the Southern New England School of Law. Cianci enlisted in the United States Army on November 29, 1966. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Military Police Corps on April 24, 1967. He served on active duty until 1969 and then in the Army Reserve as a civil affairs officer through 1972.Army Register, 1969. Vol. 2. Early legal career After being admitted to the Rhode Island Bar Association in 1967, Cianci was hired by Rhode Island Attorney General Herbert F. DeSimone as a special assistant attorney general in 1969. The position was part-time but prestigious. In 1972, Cianci backed up lead prosecutor Irving Brodsky in the trial of mob boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca. Patriarca was found not guilty, but Cianci won praise as an Italian-American fighting \\"The Mob\\", when the film The Godfather painted an unflattering image of Italian-Americans. In 1973, he became the prosecutor of the Rhode Island Attorney General's Anti-Corruption Strike Force, a position he held until his first election as mayor in 1974. As part of this task force, Cianci was involved in an investigation of Providence Mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr. Cianci was gaining a reputation as an anti- corruption crusader. During this time, Cianci gained political experience working on Attorney General Herbert DeSimone's unsuccessful campaigns for governor in 1970 and 1972. Mayor of Providence, 1974‚Äì1984 1974 campaign poster In the fall of 1974, Cianci narrowly beat incumbent Mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr. on an anti-corruption campaign. Cianci was helped by a revolt of Democrats upset with Doorley's administration. Cianci presented himself as a visionary reformer, outlining plans to revive an economically troubled downtown, rebuild the waterfront, restore blighted neighborhoods, create parks, and improve schools. Positioning himself as \\"the Anti-Corruption candidate,\\" an Italian-American candidate taking on the Irish-American Democratic machine, Cianci won his first election by 709 votes. Cianci became the city's first Italian-American Republican mayor, ending a 150-year \\"power monopoly\\" held by Irish and Italian Democrats. At the age of 33 years, 10 months and seven days, he was then the city's youngest mayor and the first Republican to lead that heavily Democratic city since 1939. Cianci was well known to be a charismatic and media-savvy politician. Cianci's propensity to attend parades, weddings, public events, and backyard neighborhood barbecues prompted a common joke that Cianci would jump to \\"attend the opening of an envelope\\". Cianci was revered by many residents of Providence, credited with the revitalizing of the city's economy and image. In the mid to late 1970s, Cianci became a rising star in the national Republican Party. After being introduced by Bob Dole, Cianci made an address at the 1976 Republican convention. There was talk of him being the first Italian-American vice president. Cianci was also seriously considered for a federal Cabinet seat in the second Gerald Ford administration, had Ford been elected in 1976. After Ford's loss to Jimmy Carter, Cianci promoted himself as a candidate for one of Rhode Island's U.S. Senate seats, aiming to expand the Republican Party's ethnic votership. Cianci clashed behind the scenes with John Chafee over Rhode Island's Republican nomination for the Senate seat. Chafee was elected to the Senate in 1976 and Cianci was re-elected as Mayor of Providence as a Republican in 1978. Cianci ran for governor in 1980, losing out to incumbent J. Joseph Garrahy. After this loss, Cianci drifted away from the Republican Party after he was not given an appointment in the Reagan administration despite his support of Ronald Reagan and intimations by Reagan's campaign manager, John Sears. In 1982 he was re-elected as Mayor of Providence as an independent. During his first tenure in office, Buddy Cianci often clashed with the Providence City Council over issues such as the municipal budget. Cianci was supported by political allies in the Providence City Council's Republican minority =First resignation= During Cianci's first administration, the Providence City Council tried to create an ordinance for residents of the city to be able to vote their public officials out of office. Cianci was forced by law to resign from office for the first time in 1984 after pleading nolo contendere or \\"no contest\\" ‚Äì neither admitting nor disputing ‚Äì on an assault charge alleging an altercation with Bristol, Rhode Island contractor, Raymond DeLeo. Cianci claimed that the man had been romantically involved with his wife, from whom Cianci was separated at the time. Both DeLeo and Cianci's estranged wife disputed the relationship. Providence municipal regulations prohibit a convicted felon from holding public office. Ironically, Cianci had promulgated that rule a few years earlier. After Cianci's resignation, a special election was held to name a replacement. Cianci attempted to run in the election under the rubric that he had been convicted of a felony, but received a five-year suspended sentence rather than being sent to prison. After a few weeks it was decided by the Rhode Island Supreme Court that Cianci could not run in the special election, because the legislative intent was that the convicted incumbent could not succeed himself in office. The special election was won by City Council Chairman, Acting Mayor, and future ambassador to Malta Joseph R. Paolino Jr.. Talk show host, 1984‚Äì1991 Cianci spent the next few years as a radio talk show host on Providence AM station 920 WHJJ and as a television commentator. In 1990 he successfully mounted a re-election campaign with the slogan, \\"He never stopped caring about Providence.\\" In the early 2000s, Cianci also made several guest appearances as himself on the television show Providence. Mayor of Providence, 1991‚Äì2002 Official portrait in Providence City Hall It was during Cianci's second run as mayor, beginning in 1991, that the city of Providence entered its \\"Renaissance phase.\\" During his tenure, Providence became visibly cleaner and more tourist-friendly. Cianci brought the Providence Bruins hockey team to Rhode Island from Maine, and pushed to further several projects in the city, including new hotels, the Providence Place shopping mall and the Fleet Skating Center.Mike Stanton, \\"Zorba the mayor\\", The Providence Journal, December 13, 2002. Accessed January 15, 2008. He also helped to orchestrate the establishment of the summer weekend festivals known as WaterFire in downtown Providence, which continues to bring up to 100,000 people to the downtown area alone on the summer nights it takes place. =Arts-friendly city= In 1996, Cianci pushed to create an Arts and Entertainment District in downtown Providence by offering income and sales tax breaks to attract artists to downtown. Cianci said the tax breaks were part of an arts-centered economic development strategy. The idea was to develop an image of Providence as an \\"artist-friendly\\" city; this would attract not only artists, but well-educated workers, high-technology firms, economic development, and tourism. The strategy was copied as a model by Baltimore and other cities. In 1998 Cianci ran again for re-election, unopposed on the ballot. The popular Cianci had never lost a mayoral election, until losing to Jorge Elorza in November 2014. =Operation Plunder Dome= Cianci was indicted in April 2001 on federal criminal charges of racketeering, conspiracy, extortion, witness tampering, and mail fraud. Several other Providence city officials were also indicted. Judge Ronald R. Lagueux said of the case: \\"Clearly, there is a feeling in city government in Providence that corruption is tolerated. In this mayor's two administrations, there has been more corruption in the City of Providence than in the history of this state.\\"Dan Barry, \\"Buddy for Life\\", The New York Times, December 31, 2000. Accessed January 15, 2008. Much of the trial was focused around a video tape showing top Cianci aide Director of Administration Frank A. Corrente taking a bribe. NBC reporter Jim Taricani aired the tape on local television station WJAR, and he was sentenced to six months of house arrest for refusing to reveal his sources to the court. Cianci did not maintain a low profile after the indictment but poked fun at the investigation, code-named \\"Operation Plunder Dome\\". Nine people (including Cianci) were convicted in the trials, which were presided over by Judge Ernest C. Torres. Cianci was acquitted of 26 out of 27 charges, including bribery, extortion, and mail fraud, but he was found guilty of racketeering conspiracy, running a corrupt criminal enterprise. In September 2002, Cianci was sentenced to serve five years in federal prison by Judge Torres, who opted for a higher sentence than the minimum required by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Cianci was forced by law to resign immediately following the sentencing. Between his sentencing and the start of his jail term, Cianci resumed his radio career hosting a midday show with former Providence radio host (and former director of communications to Governor Don Carcieri) Steve Kass on AM talk station WPRO. After some legal wrangling, Cianci's lawyers managed to have him sent to prison closer to Rhode Island, and Cianci served his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix, in Burlington County, New Jersey. Cianci appealed the conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,U.S. v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71 (2004) but was unsuccessful. In August 2005, Cianci made a request for early release, but was denied. Later life Cianci was released from prison on May 30, 2007, to a halfway house near Northeastern UniversityMichelle R. Smith, \\"Cianci arrives at Boston halfway house after release from prison\\", Boston.com, May 30, 2007. Accessed January 15, 2008. in Boston. Upon his initial release from federal prison, he had already secured a job in marketing and sales for the XV Beacon, a luxury hotel in Boston. However, he ultimately chose to return to Rhode Island and began work at the 903 Residences in Providence.Raja Mishra, \\"Cianci snubs Boston for job in R.I.\\", The Boston Globe, June 9, 2007. Accessed January 15, 2008. =Political commentator= On September 20, 2007, Cianci returned to the airwaves on local Providence AM radio station WPRO, hosting a weekday talk show. He said that he had no plans to run for political office again, although he had not entirely ruled it out when pressed on the issue. On October 24, 2007, Cianci appeared on WLNE-TV ABC6 to announce that in addition to his radio show, he was joining the television station as chief political analyst and contributing editor. The work included moderating a weekly political segment called Your Attention Please, which was renamed Buddy TV. The timeslot became a daily segment in July 2008, and was renamed The World According to Buddy as of May 2011. His position at WLNE began on November 1, 2007. Cianci also hosted the station's weekend public affairs program On the Record with Buddy Cianci. He began in October 2008 as co-host of the program with WLNE weeknight anchor John DeLuca and became solo host in May 2011. =2014 campaign for Mayor of Providence= Cianci became eligible to run for mayor again in the year 2012, three years after his probation ended (due to the provisions of the 1986 Rhode Island constitutional amendment, aptly named \\"the Buddy amendment\\").Joe Vileno, \\"Buddy Cianci\\" , The Phoenix, September 24, 2007. Accessed January 15, 2008. The next election in which Cianci would have been eligible to run was the November 2014. In 2010, Cianci was quoted as saying that he was \\"taking a good look\\" at running for the U.S. House seat to be vacated by Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy. He did not declare his candidacy. In May 2014, Cianci, after being successfully treated for cancer, was cleared by his doctors to run for mayor in the 2014 November election.\\"Doctors Clear Buddy Cianci to Run for Mayor if He Wants\\", ABC 6, May 6, 2014. Accessed May 8, 2014. On June 25, Cianci declared his candidacy for Mayor of Providence as an independent. In August he named former Cianci staffer Cyd McKenna as his campaign manager and Dee Dee Witman as his finance chair, alongside other former staffers Charles Mansolillo and Beryl Kenyon. His campaign was unsuccessful and he lost to Democrat Jorge Elorza, conceding the election on November 4. =Illness and death= In January 2014, Cianci was diagnosed with colon cancer. Cianci died on January 28, 2016, at the age of 74. He had been taken to the hospital the previous day after experiencing abdominal pain while filming his television show, On the Record with Buddy Cianci, at the WLNE-TV studio. Thousands of people viewed Cianci's open casket as his body lay in state for two days in Providence City Hall, the first mayor to be so honored since Thomas Doyle in 1886. A horse-drawn carriage carried his casket through the city during a snowstorm on February 8, as it made its way to the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul where Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Joseph Tobin presided over a funeral mass. The funeral procession then passed through Olneyville and Silver Lake, where Cianci grew up, ending at St. Ann's Cemetery in Cranston for a private burial next to his parents and daughter, Nicole.

However, an August 2014 Associated Press report found that \\"in recent years, no money from the sauce's sales has been donated to Cianci's charity scholarship fund, The Associated Press has learned. From 2009 to 2012, the sauce made a total of $3 in income, longtime Cianci adviser Charles Mansolillo told the AP. In 2009, they lost $2,200 on the sauce, Mansolillo said. The following year, they made $2,974, while in 2011, they lost $2,969. In 2012, they made $2,198 profit, he said.

These smaller transforms of size N1 and N2 can then be evaluated by applying PFA recursively or by using some other FFT algorithm. PFA should not be confused with the mixed-radix generalization of the popular Cooley‚ÄìTukey algorithm, which also subdivides a DFT of size N = N1N2 into smaller transforms of size N1 and N2. The latter algorithm can use any factors (not necessarily relatively prime), but it has the disadvantage that it also requires extra multiplications by roots of unity called twiddle factors, in addition to the smaller transforms. On the other hand, PFA has the disadvantages that it only works for relatively prime factors (e.g. it is useless for power-of-two sizes) and that it requires a more complicated re-indexing of the data based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Note, however, that PFA can be combined with mixed-radix Cooley‚ÄìTukey, with the former factorizing N into relatively prime components and the latter handling repeated factors. PFA is also closely related to the nested Winograd FFT algorithm, where the latter performs the decomposed N1 by N2 transform via more sophisticated two-dimensional convolution techniques. Some older papers therefore also call Winograd's algorithm a PFA FFT. (Although the PFA is distinct from the Cooley‚ÄìTukey algorithm, Good's 1958 work on the PFA was cited as inspiration by Cooley and Tukey in their 1965 paper, and there was initially some confusion about whether the two algorithms were different. In fact, it was the only prior FFT work cited by them, as they were not then aware of the earlier research by Gauss and others.) Algorithm Recall that the DFT is defined by the formula: :X_k = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N} nk} \\\\quad k = 0,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, N - 1. The PFA involves a re-indexing of the input and output arrays, which when substituted into the DFT formula transforms it into two nested DFTs (a two- dimensional DFT). =Re-indexing= Suppose that N = N1N2, where N1 and N2 are relatively prime. In this case, we can define a bijective re-indexing of the input n and output k by: :\\\\begin{align} n &= n_1 N_2 + n_2 N_1 \\\\mod N, \\\\\\\\\\\\ k &= k_1 N_2^{-1} N_2 + k_2 N_1^{-1} N_1 \\\\mod N, \\\\end{align} where N1‚àí1 denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of N1 modulo N2 and vice versa for N2‚àí1; the indices ka and na run from 0, ‚Ä¶, Na ‚àí 1 (for a = 1, 2). These inverses only exist for relatively prime N1 and N2, and that condition is also required for the first mapping to be bijective. This re-indexing of n is called the Ruritanian mapping (also Good's mapping), while this re-indexing of k is called the CRT mapping. The latter refers to the fact that k is the solution to the Chinese remainder problem k = k1 mod N1 and k = k2 mod N2. (One could instead use the Ruritanian mapping for the output k and the CRT mapping for the input n, or various intermediate choices.) A great deal of research has been devoted to schemes for evaluating this re-indexing efficiently, ideally in-place, while minimizing the number of costly modulo (remainder) operations (Chan, 1991, and references). =DFT re-expression= The above re-indexing is then substituted into the formula for the DFT, and in particular into the product nk in the exponent. Because e2œÄi = 1, this exponent is evaluated modulo N: any N1N2 = N cross term in the nk product can be set to zero. (Similarly, Xk and xn are implicitly periodic in N, so their subscripts are evaluated modulo N.) The remaining terms give: : X_{k_1 N_2^{-1} N_2 + k_2 N_1^{-1} N_1} = \\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1} \\\\left( \\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} x_{n_1 N_2 + n_2 N_1} e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N_2} n_2 k_2} \\\\right) e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N_1} n_1 k_1}. The inner and outer sums are simply DFTs of size N2 and N1, respectively. (Here, we have used the fact that N1‚àí1N1 is unity when evaluated modulo N2 in the inner sum's exponent, and vice versa for the outer sum's exponent.)

(1968) Terry-Thomas (born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens; 10 July 19118 January 1990) was an English comedian and character actor who became known to a worldwide audience through his films during the 1950s and 1960s. He often portrayed disreputable members of the upper classes, especially cads, toffs and bounders, using his distinctive voice; his costume and props tended to include a monocle, waistcoat and cigarette holder. His striking dress sense was set off by a gap between his two upper front teeth. Born in London, Terry-Thomas made his film debut, uncredited, in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). He spent several years appearing in smaller roles, before wartime service with Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) and Stars in Battledress. The experience helped sharpen his cabaret and revue act, increased his public profile and proved instrumental in the development of his successful comic stage routine. Upon his demobilisation, he starred in Piccadilly Hayride on the London stage and was the star of the first comedy series on British television, How Do You View? (1949). He appeared on various BBC Radio shows, and made a successful transition into British films. His most creative period was the 1950s when he appeared in Private's Progress (1956), The Green Man (1956), Blue Murder at St Trinian's (1957), I'm All Right Jack (1959) and Carlton-Browne of the F.O. (1959). Beginning the 1960s by starring in School for Scoundrels, Terry-Thomas then began appearing in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in films such as Bachelor Flat (1962), It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) and How to Murder Your Wife (1965). From the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande Vadrouille. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He spent much of his fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, existing on charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home. Biography =Early life: 1911‚Äì1933= Ardingly College, where Terry-Thomas engaged in amateur dramatics Terry-Thomas was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens at 53 Lichfield Grove, Finchley, North London. He was the fourth of five children born to Ernest Frederick Stevens, managing director of a butcher's business at Smithfield Market and part-time amateur actor, and his wife Ellen Elizabeth Stevens (n√©e Hoar). As a child, Terry- Thomas was often referred to as Tom, the diminutive used by his family. He led a generally happy childhood, but believed his parents secretly desired a daughter in his place. By the time he reached adolescence, his parents' marriage had failed and both became alcoholics. In an attempt to bring them together, Terry-Thomas often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines, reciting jokes and singing and dancing around the family home. The performances seldom worked, and his father became increasingly removed from his family. In 1921 Terry-Thomas began to nurture his distinctive, well-spoken voice, reasoning that \\"using good speech automatically suggested that you were well-educated and made people look up to you\\". He used the speech of the actor Owen Nares as a basis for his own delivery. Terry-Thomas became fascinated by the stage, and regularly attended the Golders Green Hippodrome to see the latest shows. It was there that he developed an interest in fashion, and adopted the debonair dress-sense of his hero Douglas Fairbanks. Terry-Thomas attended Fernbank School in Hendon Lane, Finchley, which was a welcome escape from the stresses of his parents' break- up. When he was 13, he transferred to Ardingly College, a public school in Sussex. He excelled in Latin and geography, and briefly took up drama. The latter subject later led to his expulsion from the school, after his frequent and inappropriate use of ad lib during lessons. He also took up a position in the school jazz band, first playing the ukulele and then percussion and additionally he often performed comedy dancing routines to the band's music. Erich von Stroheim, on whom Terry-Thomas based his early look Terry-Thomas enjoyed his time at Ardingly, and relished his association with upper middle class school friends. His academic abilities were modest, and he came to the notice of staff only through his frequent tomfoolery. Although he initially felt intimidated by his school surroundings, his confidence grew as he put on \\"a bold, undiluted and sustained show of chutzpah\\", according to his biographer, Graham McCann. On his return home to Finchley in 1927, his more mature manner impressed the family's housekeeper Kate Dixon, who seduced him at the family home. He stayed at Ardingly for one more term and returned home to London, but made no plans to further his education or start long-term work. Instead, he accepted a temporary position at Smithfield Market, where he earned 15 shillings a week as a junior transport clerk for the Union Cold Storage Company. By his own admission, he never stopped \\"farting around\\" and often kept his colleagues entertained with impersonations of the Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Erich von Stroheim. He invented various characters, including Colonel Featherstonehaugh-Bumleigh and Cora Chessington-Crabbe, and frequently recited comic stories involving them to his colleagues. His characterisations soon came to the notice of the company's management who prompted him to enrol in the company's amateur drama club. He made his d√©but with the drama company as Lord Trench in The Dover Road which was staged at the Fortune Theatre, London. The production was popular with audiences, and he subsequently became a regular performer in many amateur productions. Terry-Thomas made his professional stage d√©but on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric Railwayman's Dining Club in South Kensington. He was billed as Thos Stevens, but only appeared as a minor turn. His performance brought heckles from the drunken audience, but earned him a commission of 30 shillings. After this, he played a few minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions by the Edgware Operatic Society at the Scala Theatre. In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became travelling salesman of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing in order to make his pitch. In his spare time, he began playing the ukulele with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs. He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of Jessie Matthews. The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues, and they earned well from it. News soon travelled of the couple's talent, and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in Cricklewood. He found the dance-style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment. =Early performances: 1933‚Äì1939= \\"Everyone was talking about the gap between my teeth, my monocle, the fancy waistcoats I wore and the seven-inch cigarette holders I used.\\" ‚ÄîTerry-Thomas on his unique look By 1933 Terry-Thomas had moved out of Finchley and into a friend's flat; the friend was a film extra who introduced him to the idea of working in the industry. Terry-Thomas made his uncredited film debut in the 1933 film, The Private Life of Henry VIII, which starred Charles Laughton in the title role. Between 1933 and 1941 Terry-Thomas appeared in 16 films, as an uncredited extra in all but one; he later said that \\"this work suited me down to the ground. It wasn't really like work to me. I got an enormous kick out of it\\". His first speaking role came in the 1935 Buddy Rogers comedy Once in a Million where he shouted \\"A thousand!\\" during an auction. During the 1936 musical comedy This'll Make You Whistle, starring Jack Buchanan, he permanently damaged his hearing as a result of jumping into a water tank. In between his film work, he developed his cabaret act and was employed as a dance teacher at the Aida Foster School of Dancing in Golders Green. During this period, he billed himself as Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised the name to its backward spelling of Mot Snevets; the name did not last long and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was \\"not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't mean much apart; together they made a trade name\\": the hyphen was also \\"to match the gap in his front teeth\\". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased \\"the most irresistible holder in Dunhill's. It was slightly outr√© because it was made of lacquered, black whangee ... with a gold band twisting neatly round it\\". Adding to his look were a \\"monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation\\". He later wrote that \\"sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who would have loved to have been a genuine eccentric\\". In 1937 Terry-Thomas met the South African dancer and choreographer Ida Florence Patlansky, who went by the stage-name Pat Patlanski, while she was auditioning in London for a partner for her flamenco dancing act. Patlanski was keen to employ Terry-Thomas as a comedian rather than a dancer, and they established a cabaret double-act billed as \\"Terri and Patlanski\\", which was immediately popular with audiences. The couple became romantically involved and married on 3 February 1938 at Marylebone Register Office, afterwards moving to 29 Bronwen Court in St John's Wood. Despite the success of Terri and Patlanski, the act lasted only three months and they took on small engagements on the cabaret circuit. On 6 June 1938 Terry-Thomas made his first radio broadcast on the BBC London Regional dance programme Friends to Tea. He later recounted that \\"I didn't give a very good performance ... I was a dismal failure\\". At the end of the summer of 1938 they were hired by the bandleader Don Rico, who incorporated them into his orchestra, with Patlanski playing the piano and Terry-Thomas acting as the comp√®re. =Second World War= The Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) was formed in 1938 in order to provide entertainment to the British Armed Forces; Terry-Thomas and Patlanski signed up in 1939 and during the Phoney War were posted to France, where they appeared in a variety show. From early in their marriage, Patlanski had started having affairs, a move which prompted Terry-Thomas to reciprocate; he made sure he was sent on tour to France where a girlfriend was due to perform, although Patlanski accompanied him on the trip. During the tour, Terry-Thomas ensured Patlanski was sent back to the UK to enable him to continue his affair. On his return to Britain, he continued with his solo variety act, while also acting as the head of the cabaret section of ENSA at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he clashed regularly with his counterparts running the drama sections, Sir Seymour Hicks and Lilian Braithwaite. Terry-Thomas aimed to produce \\"good shows, sophisticated, impeccable and highly polished\\", which included the violinist Eugene Pini playing light classical music, and the Gainsborough Girls chorus line. In April 1942 Terry-Thomas received his call-up papers; he later wrote that \\"it would have seemed rather rude and ungrateful to refuse\\"; as a result, he left ENSA and reported to the Royal Corps of Signals training depot in Ossett, West Riding of Yorkshire. Within two weeks of his arrival he hired Ossett Town Hall and staged a concert, which included a freshly written sketch about his feet, which had been suffering in his army boots. After basic training he was promoted to the rank of corporal and he applied for a commission. He was turned down because training had caused a duodenal ulcer, and his hearing was still problematic; as a result he was downgraded from A1 to B1 fitness at the start of 1943. Terry-Thomas continued to appear in cabaret and variety shows while in the army, including at the Astoria Cinema in York, where he was seen by George Black. Black established the entertainment troupe, Stars in Battledress, which was composed of entertainers who were serving in the forces, and he invited Terry-Thomas to join. In February 1943 he appeared in his first Stars in Battledress show at London's Olympia, where he introduced the sketch \\"Technical Hitch\\". This involved him portraying a harassed BBC announcer introducing records that are missing. In order to cover up for the absent records he would use his vocal range of four and a half octaves to mimic the singers; he included \\"impersonations of Britain's clipped crooner No√´l Coward, the African-American bass-baritone Paul Robeson, the Peruvian songbird Yma Sumac, the Austrian tenor Richard Tauber and ... the entire Luton Girls Choir\\". The show went on a national tour, with the stand-up comedian Charlie Chester as compere, during which Terry-Thomas refined and polished his act and finished as \\"one of the most prominent and influential members of Stars in Battledress\\". Terry-Thomas, along with his Stars in Battledress unit, travelled through Britain and Europe on a tour that lasted several months. After the tour, and with his demobilisation approaching, he took compassionate leave in order to have free time while still receiving army pay. During his absence he went on a tour of the UK organised by George Black, accompanied on the piano by a former colonel, Harry Sutcliffe. Terry-Thomas finished the war as a sergeant, and was finally demobbed on 1 April 1946. =Early post-war work: 1946‚Äì1955= The ENSA and Stars in Battledress tours of Britain and Europe had raised Terry-Thomas's profile and, by October 1946, he was appearing alongside Sid Field in Piccadilly Hayride at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London. The show was described by Graham McCann as \\"the West End's biggest money-spinner for years\\". Terry-Thomas compered the show as well as appearing in some of the sketches, including his own \\"Technical Hitch\\" routine. In 1959 he described the effect of Piccadilly Hayride on his career, saying \\"This show made me overnight. I'd arrived\\". Ivor Brown, writing in The Observer, remarked on the \\"glorious rag of BBC modes, moods and intonations by Mr. Terry Thomas, a grand discovery\\". Within three weeks of starting his run, Terry-Thomas was invited to appear at the Royal Command Performance on 4 November 1946 at the London Palladium. Piccadilly Hayride ran for 778 performances and ended on 17 January 1948. The show was seen by over a million people and earned ¬£350,000 at the box office. In conjunction with Piccadilly Hayride, Terry-Thomas undertook a number of other additional one-off appearances in cabaret and private functions. He also appeared in editions of Variety Bandbox and Workers' Playtime on BBC Radio. His ever-evolving act consisted of imitations, including that of his friend, the musician Leslie Hutchinson (known as \\"Hutch\\"); sketches, including \\"Technical Hitch\\"; urbane monologues, and \\"languid shaggy dog stories\\". At the end of his run with Piccadilly Hayride, Terry-Thomas took a three-week break to recover from nervous exhaustion and a recurrence of his peptic ulcer. He went back to cabaret and acted as a compere at the London Palladium before making his radio breakthrough on 12 October 1948 with his own series on the BBC Home Service. Consisting of a \\"mixture of sketches, solo routines, musical interludes and a range of popular and topical star guests\\", To Town with Terry was broadcast weekly and ran for 24 episodes until 28 March 1949. He was disappointed with the series, saying \\"I was never totally satisfied with [it] ... The perfectionist in me always made me aware of anything that was less than first class\\". He also appeared in his first post-war film, A Date with a Dream, in 1949, alongside his wife. On 26 October 1949 Terry-Thomas wrote and starred in a new series on the BBC Television Service, How Do You View?, noted for being the first comedy series on British television. The programme was based around an on-screen persona of Terry- Thomas as \\"a glamorous, mischievous and discreetly cash-strapped man-about- town\\", introducing a series of sketches in which he appeared alongside Peter Butterworth as his chauffeur; Janet Brown (Butterworth's real-life wife); Avril Angers; H.C. Walton as the family retainer, Moulting; and Diana Dors. The programme was broadcast live and often included Terry-Thomas walking through control rooms and corridors of the BBC's Lime Grove and Alexandra Palace studios. The author and historian Mark Lewisohn described the series as being \\"inventive ... truly televisual and not just a radio programme in costume\\". The series ran until 21 December 1949; a second series followed between April and May 1950, with Sid Colin taking over the scripting duties and Terry-Thomas providing additional material. By the third series, which was broadcast between November 1950 and February 1951, the audience reached four million viewers. In total there were five series of How Do You View?; the final episode was broadcast on 11 June 1952. Writing about Terry-Thomas on television, Wilfred Greatorex observed that \\"he has ... physical attributes that make him a gift to visual entertainment: a large, rather gaunt face, pre- fabricated for close-ups; the notorious space of one-third of an inch between his two most prominent top teeth; a mouth that is full of expression. Add to these pictoral advantages his eight-inch cigarette holder and Eddie Cantor eyes\\". Terry-Thomas in May 1951 In between filming How Do You View?, Terry- Thomas continued performing on radio as well as in cabaret, in Britain and increasingly the US. In October and November 1949 he appeared at the Palmer House Night Club, Chicago; in June 1951 he appeared at The Wedgwood Room, Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York, and between 22 December 1951 and 29 February 1952 he returned to the London Palladium for 109 performances in Humpty Dumpty. In September 1952 he travelled to the Federation of Malaya to entertain British troops in a series of concert parties, before returning to the UK to appear in the Royal Variety Performance in November. He finished the year in South Africa, as Honourable Idle Jack in Dick Whittington, which finished in January 1953; he considered the pantomime to be \\"so tatty and unrehearsed it was pathetic\\". In June 1953 Terry-Thomas broadcast the pilot episode of the radio show, Top of the Town; the show was successful and the BBC commissioned a series of 16 episodes, which ran between November 1953 and February 1954. In between recording sessions, he appeared at the London Palladium in the revue Fun and the Fair, with George Formby and the Billy Cotton band, from October 1953. Fun and the Fair was unsuccessful at the box office and closed on 19 December 1953, after 138 performances. Terry-Thomas then reprised his role of Idle Jack for a run of performances in the Granada theatres of Sutton and Woolwich, and the Finsbury Park Empire, which ran to the end of January 1954. That year, he separated from Patlanski following an increase in domestic tension and the plethora of affairs in which they had both indulged. Patlanski moved out of the shared home, and the couple lived separate lives; the press did not report the separation until 1957. Terry- Thomas spent the 1954 summer season performing at the Winter Gardens Pavilion, Blackpool before starring in a second series of Top of the Town, which ran from October 1954 to February 1955. At the end of the series he appeared as Hubert Crone in the play Room for Two, which had a UK tour prior to a run at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London. The last stop on the UK tour was at the Brighton Hippodrome, where Terry-Thomas broke his arm on stage; he returned to the show five days later when the tour reached London. He later joked that \\"the audience roared with laughter when I fell and made horrible faces, so much so that I considered breaking the other arm for an encore\\". The London run was not a success and the show closed after 48 performances. =British film years: 1956‚Äì1961= Terry-Thomas in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, 1963 In February 1956 Terry-Thomas appeared on Desert Island Discs, and chose two songs from his \\"Technical Hitch\\" routine as part of his selection. Later that year he appeared in his first major film roles: Charles Boughtflower in The Green Man, and Major Hitchcock, \\"a charlatan military officer on the take\\", in Private's Progress, directed by the Boulting brothers. Terry-Thomas appeared in the latter film only briefly, with a total screen time of about ten minutes, but his biographer Graham McCann thought the actor \\"came close to stealing the show from the central character\\", Windrush played by Ian Carmichael. Terry-Thomas's depiction of the character was not how he wished to play it: his desired choice was that of a \\"silly-ass\\" sergeant major, but the role was written as a strict, alcohol and prescription drug-dependent Army officer. He was initially disappointed with the role, and turned it down but, after being persuaded to accept it by his agent, he embraced its possibilities. One of his lines, delivered in his clipped upper class voice, was \\"You're an absolute shower\\", which became a catchphrase for him. The Boulting brothers were so impressed with Terry-Thomas's performance that they signed him up to a five-film deal. The first of the five films was Brothers in Law, in which Terry-Thomas played the spiv Alfred Green, a performance which was based on Sid Field's characterisation in Piccadilly Hayride. Roy Boulting later recounted that one short scene with Terry-Thomas, Richard Attenborough and Ian Carmichael took 107 takes because of Terry-Thomas's unfamiliarity with filming techniques; he initially struggled to hit his marks, or give his line and move on, while still acting. Filming the scene took two days and Boulting described it as a \\"unique experience for him, and had a wonderful after- effect\\". Following Brothers in Law he was cast as Romney Carlton-Ricketts in Blue Murder at St Trinian's by producers Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, before again appearing for the Boulting brothers in the cameo role of a local policeman in Happy Is the Bride. Terry-Thomas starred in two further films in 1957. The first was as Bertrand Welch in Lucky Jim, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Kingsley Amis. Although Amis thought Terry-Thomas has been \\"totally miscast as Bertrand, the posturing painter and leading shit\\" of the book, the critic for The Manchester Guardian considered Terry-Thomas as being \\"the nearest to a complete success\\" in the film, in a portrayal that \\"suggests possibilities for more serious roles\\". His final part of 1957 was Lord Henry Mayley in The Naked Truth; this brought him together with Peter Sellers for the first time, and the two of them appeared frequently together over the next few years in scenes in which, Graham McCann considered that each actor's performance \\"highlight[ed] what was special about the other\\". During one scene Terry-Thomas was dumped in a near-freezing lake, and his health was affected for some time afterwards. Peter Sellers, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in four films between 1957 and 1959 In 1958 Terry-Thomas received the first of his two film award nominations, the BAFTA Award for the \\"Best British Actor in 1959\\" for the part of Ivan in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film tom thumb. He later described the film as his second favourite; he appeared opposite Sellers for much of his screen time, and later said that \\"my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it\\". Terry-Thomas was still suffering with poor health following the filming of The Naked Truth when he suffered an attack of lumbago; filming went on for 85 days during 1957‚Äì58, and he took painkillers to enable him to continue. The role was physically demanding, and required him to ride a horse, run long distances and fight in a duel. He said he fought and ran \\"just as [he] had seen Douglas Fairbanks Snr do in The Mark of Zorro\\". Towards the end of filming, Terry- Thomas went to a Christmas party at the Trocadero, where he drank champagne, as well as taking codeine tablets, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. He considered the arresting policemen to have been rude, and \\"their attitude made me extremely angry and when I get angry ... I just go completely off my nut\\". The case came to court on 14 March 1958 and his legal team from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer provided a medical report which showed Terry-Thomas had been on a course of prescription painkillers due to a gruelling filming schedule; along with inconsistencies in the arresting policemen's notes, the case proved inconclusive and was dismissed. For much of the rest of 1958, Terry-Thomas appeared on stage at the London Palladium in Large as Life, alongside Harry Secombe, Eric Sykes and Hattie Jacques. He played one of the Three Musketeers in one sketch and had another turn called \\"Filling the Gap\\"; the show ran for a total of 380 performances between May and December 1958. He also released his first record, Strictly T-T, a collection of comic songs and sketches. In 1959 Terry-Thomas published his first autobiography, Filling the Gap, named after his spot in Large as Life; he explained that \\"everything that has been printed about me is lies. I'm not suggesting the writers were lying, I was\\". During the year he also appeared in two further instalments of the Boultings brothers' series of institutional satires, having appeared in the previous three. The first, in which he was joined again by Sellers, was Carlton-Browne of the F.O., in which he played Cadogan de Vere Carlton-Browne, a character he described as being \\"rubble from the nostrils up\\", \\"a certain type of Englishman, the Englishman who reads The Times and no other newspaper. A brolly carrier. A squash player. A bowler hat wearer. White collar, stiff, of course\\". Film writer Andrew Spicer thought Terry-Thomas's role \\"was the quintessential upper-class 'silly-ass', a sad relic of a vanished world\\". The film was initially chosen as Britain's entry for the 1959 Moscow International Film Festival until the Foreign Office petitioned the British Film Producers' Association for it to be withdrawn on the basis that the Russians might consider the film to accurately portray British diplomatic behaviour. Terry-Thomas in How to Murder Your Wife, 1965‚Äîhis favourite film to make Terry-Thomas's final film with the Boulting brothers was I'm All Right Jack, a post-war follow-up to Private's Progress with Terry-Thomas reprising the role of Major Hitchcock to an industrial setting, as the \\"tetchily incompetent\\" personnel manager. Many of the other cast from Private's Progress also returned, including Attenborough, Carmichael and Dennis Price; they were joined by Peter Sellers, who took most of the plaudits from the critics, although Stanley Kauffman, writing in The New Republic also delighted in Terry-Thomas's \\"finesse\\" and \\"extraordinary skill\\". The Los Angeles Times retrospectively considered I'm All Right Jack and Carlton-Browne of the F.O. to have been Terry-Thomas's best works. His final film of 1959 was as William Delany Gordon in Too Many Crooks. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times thought Terry-Thomas provided \\"some of the fieriest conniptions to be seen on the contemporary screen\\", going on to say the actor's \\"skill is exercised in demonstrating how magnificently and completely a mad-cap comedian can completely blow his top. His eyes flash, his lips curl, his sibilants whistle and he glares like a maniac\\". Filming took place during the daytime; in the evenings he appeared at the London Palladium, something he found trying on his nervous system. In 1960 Terry-Thomas appeared as Raymond Delauney in School for Scoundrels, a film his biographer, Robert Ross, called \\"the definitive screen presentation of his frightfully well-mannered, well- read and well-educated lounge lizard: T-T the man as T-T the film star\\". He again appeared opposite Ian Carmichael, and they were joined by Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. Michael Brooke, writing for the British Film Institute, thought Terry-Thomas was \\"outstanding as a classic British bounder\\". CNN would list the performance among the top 10 British villains, stating, \\"generally found twirling his cigarette holder while charming the ladies ‚Äî at least, when not swindling, cheating or behaving like an absolute rotter.\\"\\"The Screening Room's Top 10 British Villains\\" , CNN. Retrieved 7 October 2020. Later the same year he appeared in Make Mine Mink as Major Albert Rayne, a veteran of the Second World War who forms a gang of mink coat thieves with his female co- lodgers. When he made an appearance at a screening of the film in Dalston, north-east London, he was presented with a white mink waistcoat by a local furrier. In 1961 Terry-Thomas played Archibald Bannister in A Matter of WHO, which he described as \\"my first (fairly) serious role\\". He was joined in the film by his cousin's son Richard Briers,Obituary: Richard Briers, The Daily Telegraph, 18 February 2013. Retrieved 26 May 2019 with Terry-Thomas noting that he provided \\"no nepotic help\\" in getting Briers the part. The film was not well received by the critics; an internal BBC memo described that in the UK the film was \\"murdered by the critics\\", although it was \\"something of a success\\" in America. By this time Terry-Thomas had decided to stop being a stand-up comedian and compere and instead concentrate solely on making films. He stopped appearing on television and radio shows of his own, declaring \\"it was the cinema for me and me for the cinema!\\" Having accumulated considerable experience by appearing in British films, he decided to try Hollywood, and moved to America. =Breaking into Hollywood: 1961‚Äì1965= Terry-Thomas spent part of 1961 in America, filming the role of Professor Bruce Patterson in Bachelor Flat‚Äîhis first Hollywood role‚Äîbefore flying to Gibraltar to film Operation Snatch, in which he teamed up with Lionel Jeffries. By the end of 1961 Terry-Thomas was appearing on radio, such as the December broadcast of The Bing Crosby Show and in guest spots on American television shows; he was frequently the subject of US newspaper interviews. In 1962 Bachelor Flat and Operation Snatch were both released, and were followed by two more films: a large-budget biopic from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer called The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, in which Terry-Thomas shared his scenes with the American comedian Buddy Hackett, and Kill or Cure, in which he appeared with Sykes, a friend since they worked together in Large as Life. On 1 February 1962 Terry- Thomas and Pat Patlanski divorced, having spent the previous eight years estranged. He had by then split from his mistress of the previous few years, Lorrae Desmond, who returned to Australia shortly afterwards and married a surgeon; Terry-Thomas resumed his bachelor life-style. The break-up with Desmond caused him great upset, and he sought solace with Belinda Cunningham, a 21-year-old whom he had met on holiday in Majorca two years previously. The couple began a romance, and married in August 1963 at Halstead Registry Office near Colchester, Essex. The following year she gave birth to their first son‚ÄîTimothy Hoar‚Äîat the Princess Beatrice Hospital in London. Publicity shot of Terry-Thomas for The Bing Crosby Show, 1961 In 1962 Terry-Thomas was offered the role of Lt-Colonel J. Algernon Hawthorne in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, and turned down the opportunity before leaving for the UK. By the time his flight arrived in London he had changed his mind, so he telephoned producer Stanley Kramer from the airport to signal his acceptance, and \\"popped back on a plane to be fitted for the part\\" the same day. He was not comfortable with many of the other actors on set, later commenting that \\"I was the only non-American, and I found it exhausting and embarrassing because they never relaxed. They were always 'on'.\\" One of the American stars was Spencer Tracy, whom Terry-Thomas considered \\"an extra-special man\\"; Tracy and Buster Keaton‚Äîwho also appeared in the film‚Äîwere described by Terry-Thomas as \\"the only two people who ever produced in me this awe of greatness\\". Later in 1963 he picked up his second film nomination, the Golden Globe for Best Comedy Actor for his portrayal of Spender in The Mouse on the Moon. He also tried his hand at production, with three 15-minute travelogues: Terry-Thomas in Tuscany, Terry-Thomas in the South of France and Terry-Thomas in Northern Ireland. He did not enjoy the producer's role, complaining that \\"for some extraordinary reason that I could never understand, everybody was always out to do the producer of any film whoever he was. I had to be on the watch the whole time\\". He worked consistently during 1963, appearing in television programmes on both sides of the Atlantic; these included Terry-Thomas, a one-off variety show on BBC Television in July that included Donald Sutherland. In 1964 Terry-Thomas started filming the role of Charles Furbank in How to Murder Your Wife, a part which brought him ¬£100,000, his largest fee up to that point. He said it was his favourite to make, \\"because I felt that I did a very good job\\". He enjoyed working with Jack Lemmon, the film's star, partly because Lemmon would play jazz and sing while the scenes were being lit: the two became friends and Terry-Thomas was invited to Lemmon's wedding. Throughout the rest of the year Terry-Thomas continued to appear on US television, again in Burke's Law, but also on What's My Line? and An Hour with Robert Goulet, both on CBS; he also released another record, Terry-Thomas Discovers America, a collection of songs and sketches, described by Billboard as \\"a funny, funny comedy masterpiece\\". His earlier record Strictly T-T was also released in the US. Alongside How to Murder Your Wife, there were two further releases for Terry-Thomas in 1965: Strange Bedfellows, in which he played the part of a mortician, and Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. In the latter, he played Sir Percy Ware-Armitage, a character the film historian Andrew Spicer calls \\"a cartoon version\\" of his usual persona in a \\"bloated mid-Atlantic comed[y]\\". In the film, Terry-Thomas appeared again with Sykes, an experience Sykes later described as magical. The roles of Ware-Armitage and his sidekick were written especially for Terry-Thomas and Sykes at the behest of the director Ken Annakin. =European cinema: 1966‚Äì1970= By the mid-1960s Terry-Thomas was tiring of the Hollywood lifestyle, and, during the latter half of the 1960s, he worked with European filmmakers, returning occasionally to the US when he was filming there. In one of his French-produced films, La Grande Vadrouille, he played Sir Reginald, a stranded Royal Air Force pilot travelling through occupied France with characters played by Bourvil and Louis de Fun√®s. The film, released in 1966, held the record for highest box-office takings in France until 2004, and it remains \\"one of the most popular films with television audiences in France\\". Terry-Thomas undertook a number of roles with the Italian cinema industry. For one of the Italian-produced films, the 1967 farce Arabella, he played four parts and used \\"the help of wigs, moustaches and lashings of Max Factor\\" to help achieve the different characterisations, which were all with the Italian actress Virna Lisi. Although the European films allowed him to travel and gave him a constant source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he \\"knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless\\". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying \\"I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked\\". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that \\"I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her\\". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry- Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would \\"listen ... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place\\"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called \\"limp\\", and Christopher Young described as \\"such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy\\". Terry-Thomas and Doris Day in Where Were You When the Lights Went Out? (1968) In 1967 Terry-Thomas met his long-time friend Denholm Elliott in Bel Air and the pair talked about Elliott's new villa in Santa Eul√†ria des Riu on the Spanish island of Ibiza. Terry-Thomas was intrigued by the possibility of a Mediterranean retreat and visited the island on the way to sing in the television special Monte Carlo: C'est La Rose (1968), a musical tour of Monte Carlo hosted by Princess Grace of Monaco. Although he initially struggled to find the right plot of ground for the right price, he eventually settled on an appropriate location; declaring he was \\"allergic to architects\\", he designed the house himself. His former wife Pat moved to the nearby island of Majorca, and Terry-Thomas's relationship with her became warm and friendly; Patlanski also had a firm friendship with Terry-Thomas's wife. In between films Terry-Thomas appeared on television on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US in March‚ÄìApril 1967 he was in \\"The Five Daughters Affair\\", a two-part story in the TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and on 22 May he appeared on The Red Skelton Hour. On British television, in an episode of the Comedy Playhouse called \\"The Old Campaigner\\", he played James Franklin-Jones, a salesman for a plastics company who was continually searching for love affairs while travelling on business. This character was \\"yet another variation on his rakish cad persona\\", according to Mark Lewisohn. The episode was well-received, and a six-part series was commissioned that ran over December 1968 and January 1969. Although the series performed well in the ratings, a second series was not commissioned. In between the pilot and the series of The Old Campaigner, in April 1968, Terry- Thomas appeared on the British ITV network in a one-off variety special, The Big Show, which combined musical numbers and his urbane monologues. Robert Ross commented that Terry-Thomas \\"seemed to delight in resurrecting his vintage sophisticated patter after years in movies ... the top raconteur was back where he belonged\\". In 1969 he again teamed up with Eric Sykes and director Ken Annakin for a joint Italian, French and British production Monte Carlo or Bust!. The film was \\"the only copper-bottomed sequel to ... Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines\\", according to Richard Ross. Terry- Thomas played Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage, the \\"thoroughly bad egg son of flying ace Sir Percy Ware-Armitage\\", his role in Those Magnificent Men. Terry- Thomas secured four other roles in minor films that year, including Arthur? Arthur! (which he joked had \\"never been shown anywhere‚Äîas far as I know!\\"), as well as on television in the UK, US and Australia. The 1970s began well for Terry-Thomas; television appearances in the UK and US were augmented by filming for The Abominable Dr. Phibes, which became what author Bruce Hallenbeck called a \\"camp classic\\", despite being described by Time Out critic David Pirie, as \\"the worst horror film made in England since 1945\\"; the film was released in 1971. On 1 August 1970 Terry-Thomas made his second appearance on Desert Island Discs; his luxury item was a case of brandy, chosen because it lasted longer than champagne. =Dealing with Parkinson's: 1971‚Äì1983= Terry-Thomas (right) and Red Skelton in The Red Skelton Show (1968) While appearing in Don't Just Lie There, Say Something! at the Metro Theatre, Sydney in 1971, Terry-Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor, who noticed his patient's left hand was shaking slightly. The doctor suggested he visit a specialist on his return to the UK, who diagnosed the actor with Parkinson's disease. Fearing the condition would affect offers of work, Terry-Thomas did not make the news public, but as the symptoms began to manifest themselves in tremors, a shuffling gait, stooped posture and affected speech, he made the news known‚Äîpartly to stop rumours of on-set drunkenness. He continued to work as much as possible, although‚Äîas the film historian Geoff Mayer pointed out‚Äîthe situation \\"reduced his film career to supporting roles and cameos\\". The lucrative voice-over role of Sir Hiss in the 1973 Walt Disney film Robin Hood was one notable part, while others were less well-known, such as The Vault of Horror, a film described by Richard Ross as a \\"cornball terror\\", in which he starred with Curd J√ºrgens, Tom Baker and Denholm Elliott. He also continued to appear on television shows in both the US and UK, as well as advertisements, including appearing with June Whitfield for Birds Eye fish fingers, a series of vermouth advertisements filmed in Italy, and an award- winning series for Benson & Hedges along with Eric Sykes. During the 1970s he starred in a series of low-budget British films, including two in 1975, Spanish Fly‚Äîcalled a \\"gruesome smutfest\\" by the writer Christopher Fowler‚Äîand The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones, described by the Film Review Digest as a \\"cheap, crude, sexed-up rehash\\" of the other film adaptations of Henry Fielding's source novel. In 1977 he starred in The Last Remake of Beau Geste and The Hound of the Baskervilles, the latter starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as Holmes and Watson; Terry-Thomas thought \\"it was the most outrageous film I ever appeared in ... there was no magic ... it was bad!\\" By then he had exhibited a decrease in bodily movement, a sign of how serious his condition had become. His distinctive voice had developed a softer tone and his posture was contorted. Between 1978 and 1980, he spent much time with medical consultants. Despite this he was offered a few engagements and had been voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured Laurence Olivier, Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White. As a result, he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the Ford Motor Company. Derek Jarman offered Terry-Thomas a role in his 1979 film The Tempest, but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health. Terry-Thomas undertook his final film role in 1980 in Febbre a 40!, a German‚ÄìItalian co- production that was \\"nondescript and barely screened\\", according to Robert Ross, and did not even have a theatrical release in its two domestic markets. He continued his involvement in the film industry, where he funded three films during the early 1980s (noted by Ross to be \\"destined from the outset for B-picture status or straight-to-video exposure\\"); he commented that \\"I have made a loss of one hundred per cent\\". In 1982, with his condition worsening, Terry-Thomas featured in two episodes of the BBC series The Human Brain, which examined his condition; his frank interview brought much public awareness of the disease and raised ¬£32,000 for the Parkinson's Disease Society. Privately, he was becoming more depressed; his London flat had been sold to provide badly needed funds, and his work offers were decreasing. =Final years and death: 1983‚Äì1990= By 1983, with his medical bills at ¬£40,000 a year, Terry-Thomas's financial resources were dwindling. He and his wife sold their dream house and moved into the small cottage once owned by his former wife Pat Patlanski, which she left to him in her will on her death in June that year. Shortly afterwards he worked with ghostwriter Terry Daum on an autobiography, Terry- Thomas Tells Tales. Although the first draft was completed by late summer 1984, Terry-Thomas refused to release the manuscript and continued to make alterations, but never completed his copyediting: the book was finally published after his death. By 1984 Terry-Thomas was increasingly depressed by his condition and when he was interviewed that year, he admitted that \\"one doctor said I've got about four more years to live. God forbid! I shall probably blow my brains out first\\". In 1987 the couple could no longer afford to live in Spain, so they moved back to London. They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three-room, unfurnished charity flat, where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Richard Briers was one of his first visitors at the flat, and was shocked by the change he saw: \\"Sitting there, motionless, he was just a mere shadow. A crippled, crushed, shadow. It was really bloody awful.\\" On 9 April 1989 the actor Jack Douglas and Richard Hope-Hawkins organised a benefit concert for Terry-Thomas, after discovering he was living in virtual obscurity, poverty and ill health. The gala, held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ran for five hours, and featured 120 artists with Phil Collins topping the bill and Michael Caine as the gala chairman. The show raised over ¬£75,000 for Terry-Thomas and Parkinson's UK. The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry-Thomas to move out of his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in Godalming, Surrey. He died there on 8 January 1990, at the age of 78. The funeral service was held at St. John the Baptist Church, Busbridge, where the theme from Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines was played; he was cremated at Guildford Crematorium. Screen persona and technique Although there were exceptions, Terry-Thomas's screen characters were generally similar; Geoff Mayer wrote that \\"although there would be variations, he would remain the 'rotter', a pretentious, elitist, seedy, sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and the easy life\\". Eric Sykes, with whom Terry- Thomas shared a number of screen moments, said it was \\"always the same character and always funny\\". Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute, called him \\"the definitive postwar cad or rotter\\". Terry-Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented, writing in the 1980s that \\"T-T with his permanent air of caddish disdain ... bounder ... aristocratic rogue ... upper-class English twit ... genuine English eccentric ... one of the last real gentlemen ... wet, genteel Englishman ... high-bred idiot ... cheeky blighter ... camel-haired cad ... amiable buffoon ... pompous Englishman ... twentieth-century dandy ... stinker ... king of the cads ... All those descriptions added up to my image as Terry-Thomas\\". Terry-Thomas identified himself as a comedy actor, but regarded himself \\"first and foremost, as a comedian with a built-in ability to inject humour into situations\\". He worked hard at the humour element, especially during his days in cabaret and revue; he wrote that he \\"spent an enormous amount of time studying how to write humour and reading books on the philosophical approach to it, but it didn't get me very far. I decided that humour was like a good watch. It would go well if left to do its job but the moment one started poking around, it went wonky\\". While working on his television series How do you View?, he would change lines around to ensure the scene worked well, even if he gave the best lines to others; it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others, including Jack Lemmon, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in How to Murder Your Wife. Lemmon commented that \\"like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors. He worked with you, not at you\\". Before starting filming or making an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: \\"my own technique to get myself going was ... to jump in the air and execute a few dance steps\\". His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in Private's Progress, a close-up was needed showing his character \\"registering shock, fury, indignation and anything else I could stuff in\\"; he \\"just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank. It's a trick I've used often since. In this way, the audience does the work\\". Terry-Thomas said \\"I like to do my own stunts\\", which he did for films such as A Matter of WHO and Bachelor Flat. This included some dangerous work; for example, during Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, he ran along the roof of a moving train. Legacy and reputation dental diastema which later provided the basis for naming a widening of the scapholunate space (\\"Terry Thomas sign\\") in a traumatic wrist injury. Following Terry-Thomas's death, Lionel Jeffries called him \\"the last of the great gentlemen of the cinema\\", while the director Michael Winner commented that \\"no matter what your position was in relation to his, as the star he was always terribly nice. He was the kindest man and he enjoyed life so much\\". Reviewing his career in The Guardian, Adrian Turner considered that \\"we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain\\"; he also said Terry-Thomas was \\"a national treasure\\". Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that \\"for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder\\"; Adair wrote that \\"the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness\\". Terry-Thomas's friend Jack Lemmon called him \\"a consummate professional ... he was a gentleman, a delight to be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much‚Äîhe made it look simple\\". Terry- Thomas's image of an English cad was used by others. The personification started in the 1960s when the voice actor Ivan Owen, who had worked alongside Terry-Thomas in \\"Stars in Battledress\\", based the voice for Basil Brush on that of Terry-Thomas, in a characterisation which also copied Terry-Thomas's \\"penchant for bad, self-satisfied, golf-club-bore jokes\\". The 1960s also witnessed the fictional cartoon character Dick Dastardly in two Hanna-Barbera cartoon series (Wacky Races and Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines), who was inspired by Terry-Thomas. Other actors have also used Terry-Thomas's persona as an inspiration for their characters: Dustin Hoffman acknowledged that he based his interpretation of the character Captain Hook in Hook on Terry-Thomas; Rupert Everett disclosed that when he provided the voice for Prince Charming in Shrek 2 Terry-Thomas \\"was vocally my role model while I was doing it\\"; and Paul Whitehouse's character, the 13th Duke of Wybourne, from The Fast Show was also modelled on Terry-Thomas's on-screen persona. Terry-Thomas's popularity continued after his death. In February 1999 the National Film Theatre ran a season of his films; an NFT spokesman described how attendees turned up \\"in evening dress, with false moustaches and carrying cigarettes in long holders ... everyone has been trying to steal the cardboard cutouts of Terry ... We've never had a response like it. To be honest, we are rather unprepared. Nobody expected Terry-Thomas Fever\\". Some of the innovations Terry-Thomas brought into his earlier television programmes were later copied by others; How Do You View? later provided the \\"prologue\\" format of Up Pompeii!, and was the first to use regular BBC announcers as foils in comic sketches‚Äîa practice continued later, particularly with the shows of Morecambe and Wise. Terry-Thomas's anecdotes, stringing several stories together, later inspired Ronnie Corbett in his monologue spot in his series The Two Ronnies. In 2014, BBC Radio 4 broadcast Memories of a Cad, a comedy drama by Roy Smiles about the relationship between Terry-Thomas and Richard Briers, played by Martin Jarvis and Alistair McGowan respectively.

In contrast to beta movement, seen at lower frequencies, the stimuli themselves do not appear to move. Instead, a diffuse, amorphous shadowlike something seems to jump in front of the stimuli and occlude them temporarily. This shadow seems to have nearly the color of the background. Max Wertheimer first described this form of apparent movement in his habilitation thesis, published 1912, marking the birth of Gestalt psychology. In a broader sense, particularly if the plural form phi phenomena is used, it applies also to all apparent movements that can be seen if two nearby optical stimuli are presented in alternation. This includes especially beta movement, which is important for the illusion of motion in cinema and animation. Actually, Wertheimer applied the term \\"œÜ-phenomenon\\" to all apparent movements described in his thesis when he introduced the term in 1912, the objectless movement he called \\"pure œÜ\\". Nevertheless, some commentators assert that he reserved the Greek letter œÜ for pure, objectless movement.  Experimental demonstration  \\"Magni-phi\\" variant of the classical experimental arrangement with more than two elements. Wertheimer's classic experiments used two light lines or curves repeatedly presented one after the other using a tachistoscope. If certain, relatively short, intervals between stimuli were used, and the distance between the stimuli was suitable, then his subjects (who happened to be his colleagues Wolfgang K√∂hler and Kurt Koffka) reported seeing pure \\"objectless\\" motion. However, it turns out to be difficult to demonstrate phi stably and convincingly. To facilitate demonstrating the phenomenon, 21st-century psychologists designed a more vivid experimental arrangement using more than two stimuli. In this demonstration, called \\"Magni-phi,\\" identical disks are arranged in a circle and, in a rapid sequence, one of the disks is hidden in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. This makes it easier to observe the kind of shadow-like movement Wertheimer discovered. The Magni-phi demonstration is robust to changes of parameters such as timing, size, intensity, number of disks, and viewing distance. Furthermore, the phenomenon may be observed more reliably even with only two elements if a negative interstimulus interval (ISI) is used (that is, if the periods during which the two elements are visible overlap slightly). In that case, the viewer may see the two objects as stationary and suppose unconsciously that the reappearance of the stimulus on one side means that the object previously displayed in that position has reappeared and not, as observed with beta movement, that the object from the opposite side has just moved to a new position. The crucial factor for this perception is the shortness of discontinuity of the stimulus on each side. This is supported by the observation that two parameters have to be chosen properly to produce the pure phi phenomenon: first the absolute duration of the gap on each side must not exceed about 150 ms., and second, the duration of the gap must not exceed 40% of the stimulus period.  History of research  In his 1912 thesis, Wertheimer introduced the symbol œÜ (phi) in the following way: Besides the \\"optimal movement\\" (later called beta movement) and partial movements of both objects, Wertheimer described a phenomenon he called \\"pure movement.\\" Concerning this, he summarized the descriptions of his test subjects as follows: Wertheimer attributed much importance to these observations because, in his opinion, they proved that movement could be perceived directly and was not necessarily deduced from the separate sensation of two optical stimuli in slightly different places at slightly different times. This aspect of his thesis was an important trigger in launching Gestalt psychology. Starting in the mid-20th century, confusion arose in the scientific literature as to exactly what the phi phenomenon was. One reason could be that the anglophone scientists had difficulties understanding Wertheimer's thesis, which was published in German. Wertheimer's writing style is also idiosyncratic. Furthermore, Wertheimer's thesis does not specify precisely under which parameters \\"pure movement\\" was observed. Moreover, it is difficult to reproduce the phenomenon. Edwin Boring's influential history of the psychology of sensation and perception, first published in 1942, contributed to this confusion. Boring listed the phenomena Wertheimer had observed and sorted them by the length of the interstimulus interval. However, Boring placed the phi phenomenon in the wrong position, namely as having a relatively long inter stimulus interval. In fact, with such long intervals, subjects do not perceive movement at all; they only observe two objects appearing successively. This confusion has probably contributed to the \\"rediscovery\\" of the phi phenomenon under other names, for example, as \\"omega motion,\\" \\"afterimage motion,\\" and \\"shadow motion.\\"  Reverse phi illusion  As apparent phi movement is perceived by human‚Äôs visual system with two stationary and similar optical stimuli presented next to each other exposing successively with high frequency, there is also a reversed version of this motion, which is reversed phi illusion. Reverse phi illusion is the kind of phi phenomenon that fades or dissolves from its positive direction to the displaced negative, so that the apparent motion human perceive is opposite to the actual physical displacement. Reverse phi illusion is often followed by black and white patterns. It is believed that reverse phi illusion is indeed brightness effects, that it occurs when brightness-reversing picture moving across our retina. It can be explained by mechanisms of visual receptive field model, where visual stimuli are summated spatially (a process that is reverse to spatial differentiation). This spacial summation blurs the contour to a small extent, and thus changes the brightness perceived. Four predictions are confirmed from this receptive field model. First, foveal reverse-phi should be broken down when the displacement is greater than the width of foveal receptive fields. Second, reverse phi illusion exists in the peripheral retina for greater displacements than in the fovea, for receptive fields are greater in the peripheral retina. Third, the spacial summation by the receptive fields could be increased by the visual blurring of the reversed phi illusion projected on a screen with defocus lens. Fourth, the amount of reversed phi illusion should be increasing with the decrease of displacement between positive and negative pictures. Indeed, our visual system processes forward and reversed phi phenomenon in the same way. Our visual system perceives phi phenomenon between individual points of corresponding brightness in successive frames, and phi movement is determined on a local, point-for-point basis mediated by brightness instead of on a global basis. = Neural mechanism underlying sensitivity to reversed phi phenomenon = * T4 and T5 motion detectors cells are necessary and sufficient for reversed phi behavior, and there is no other pathways to produce turning responses for reversed phi motion * Tangential cells show partial voltage response with the stimulation of reversed phi motion * Hassenstein-Reichardt detector model * There is substantial responses for reversed-phi in T4 dendrites, and marginal responses in T5 dendrites  Phi phenomenon and beta movement  Example of beta movement Phi phenomenon has long been confused with beta movement; however, the founder of Gestalt School of Psychology, Max Wertheimer, has distinguished the difference between them in 1912. While Phi phenomenon and Beta movement can be considered in the same category in a broader sense, they are quite distinct indeed. Firstly, the difference is on neuroanatomical level. Visual information is processed in two pathways, one processes position and motion, and the other one processes form and color. If an object is moving or changing position, it would be likely to stimulate both pathways and result in a percept of beta movement. Whereas if the object changes position too rapidly, it might result in a percept of pure movement such as phi phenomenon. Secondly, phi phenomenon and beta movement are also different perceptually. For phi phenomenon, two stimuli A and B are presented successively, what you perceive is some motion passing over A and B; while for beta movement, still with two stimuli A and B presented in succession, what you perceive would be an object actually passing from position A to position B. The difference also lies on cognitive level, about how our visual system interprets movement, which is based on the assumption that visual system solves an inverse problem of perceptual interpretation. For neighboring stimuli produced by an object, the visual system has to infer the object since the neighboring stimuli do not give the complete picture of the reality. There are more than one way for our visual system to interpret. Therefore, our visual system needs to put constraints to multiple interpretations in order to acquire the unique and authentic one. Principles employed by our visual system to set the constraints are often relevant to simplicity and likelihood.  Hassenstein‚ÄìReichardt detector model  Hassenstein‚ÄìReichardt detection model The Hassenstein‚ÄìReichardt detector model is considered to be the first mathematical model to propose that our visual system estimates motion by detecting a temporal cross-correlation of light intensities from two neighboring points, in short a theoretical neural circuit for how our visual system track motion. This model can explain and predict phi phenomenon and its reversed version. This model consists two locations and two visual inputs, that if one input at one location is detected, the signal would be sent to the other location. Two visual inputs would be asymmetrically filtered in time, then the visual contrast at one location is multiplied with the time-delayed contrast from the other location. Finally, the multiplication result would be subtracted to obtain an output. Therefore, two positive or two negative signals would generate a positive output; but if the inputs are one positive and one negative, the output would be negative. This corresponds to the multiplication rule mathematically. For phi phenomenon, motion detector would develop to detect a change in light intensities at one point on the retina, then our visual system would compute a correlation of that change with a change in light intensities of a neighboring point on the retina, with a short delay. = Reichardt model = The Reichardt model is a more complex form of the simplest Hassenstein‚ÄìReichardt detector model, which is considered to be a pairwise model with a common quadratic nonlinearity. As Fourier method is considered to be linear method, Reichardt Model introduces multiplicative nonlinearity when our visual responses to luminance changes at different element locations are combined. In this model, one photoreceptor input would be delayed by a filter to be compared by the multiplication with the other input from a neighboring location. The input would be filtered two times in a mirror-symmetrical manner, one before the multiplication and one after the multiplication, which gives a second-order motion estimation. This generalized Reichardt model allows arbitrary filters before the multiplicative nonlinearity as well as filters post-nonlinearity.

It was the winner of the 2016 Phoenix Award, which is granted by the Children's Literature Association to the best English-language children's book that did not win a major award when it was published twenty years earlier. Frindle was Clements's first novel; all of his previous works had been picture books. According to Clements, the book originated from the thought, \\"What would happen if a kid started using a new word, and other kids really liked it, but his teacher didn't?\\" Plot Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Allen is a class clown who has been formulating creative schemes throughout grade school. At the start of fifth grade in 1987, he is unhappy because his English teacher is the no- nonsense Mrs. Granger. One day, in an attempt to forestall homework, Nick decides to question Granger on where each word in the dictionary comes from. This backfires, as Mrs. Granger assigns him an essay about it. From this experience, Nick learns that individuals get to determine what words mean, and when he comes across a gold pen in the street, he decides to give a \\"pen\\" a new name: frindle. Nick's classmates really like the idea and soon, every child in the fifth grade starts using the word frindle. Mrs. Granger opposes herself to the new word, stating that the word frindle is not respectful to the word pen, which has a long history. She makes any students who are caught saying frindle stay after school and write lines, but this proves to be a problem, as this causes almost every student to stay after school. The school principal decides to visit Nick's house to end the use of frindle, but the situation is beyond Nick's personal control, and the word's usage cannot be curtailed. Frindle starts to gain national attention, and a family friend purchases the merchandising rights to the word. The word frindle spreads across the nation, and Nick thinks through the trouble that this one scheme has caused. In the epilogue, Nick is a young adult. Mrs. Granger sends him a new copy of the dictionary, recently updated to include new words, including the word frindle. She includes a letter, in which she explains that she intentionally stood against the word in order to make it more popular. Nick sends back a present ‚Äì the pen that started it all, engraved with the words, \\"This object belongs to Mrs. Lorelei Granger, and she may call it any name she chooses.\\" Awards and honors The U.S. National Education Association named Frindle one of \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\" based on a 2007 online poll. In 2012, it was ranked number 38 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with a primarily U.S. audience.

According to legend, Caligula planned to make him a consul. Legend According to Suetonius, in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars (121 AD), Caligula planned to make Incitatus a consul, Suetonius. De vita Caesarum, Caligula, 55: \\"consulatum quoque traditur destinasse\\" eng.: \\"it is also said that he planned to make him consul\\". and that the horse would \\"invite\\" dignitaries to dine with him in a house outfitted with servants there to entertain such events. He also wrote that he had a stable of marble, with an ivory manger, purple blankets, and a collar of precious stones. Cassius Dio (155-235 AD) indicated that the horse was attended by servants and was fed oats mixed with gold flake,Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.14. and that Caligula made the horse a priest.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.28. Historical accuracy The accuracy of the received history is generally questioned. Historians such as Anthony A. Barrett suggest that later Roman chroniclers such as Suetonius and Dio Cassius were influenced by the political situation of their own times, when it may have been useful to the current emperors to discredit the earlier Julio- Claudian emperors. Also, the lurid nature of the story added spice to their narratives, winning them additional readers. One suggestion is that the treatment of Incitatus by Caligula was an elaborate prank, intended to ridicule and provoke the senate, rather than a sign of insanity, or perhaps a form of satire, with the implication that a horse could perform a senator's duties.Did Caligula really make his horse a consul?, Elizabeth Nix, History Channel, June 21, 2016 Barrett notes that \\"Many stories were spread about Incitatus, originating most likely from Caligula's own humorous quips.\\" \\"Possibly out of perverted sense of humor Caligula would pour libations to Incitatus' salus [health and well-being], and claimed that he intended to co- opt him as his priest.\\" Ancient sources are clear that the horse was never made a consul.Mythbusting Ancient Rome ‚Äì Caligula‚Äôs Horse, Shushma Malik and Caillan Davenport, The Conversation, May 4, 2017 In art and metaphor * Incitatus has for centuries been an allegorical figure when referencing examples of political ineptitude, going back at least to 1742. * Act III of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard (1904) Pishchik says that his family is \\"descended from that very nag Caligula inducted into the Senate.\\" * Aleister Crowley's Liber VII Chapter 4, v. 28-30, suggest Incitatus had a deeper significance, reading, \\"Who wast Thou, O Caesar, that Thou knewest God in an horse?

For the TV series Gummidge had a set of interchangeable turnip, mangelwurzel and swede heads, each of which suited a particular occasion or endowed him with a specific skill. Outline Worzel Gummidge is a scarecrow that can come to life on Scatterbrook Farm. Worzel stands in a ten acre field. He befriended John and Susan who came to stay during the school holidays on the Braithwaite's farm. Worzel normally lands John and Susan in trouble when he is being mischievous, as he goes into a sulk and becomes a normal lifeless scarecrow. This leads others to blame the two children for the trouble he causes. The Worzel Gummidge books differ from the television adaption, one difference being that in the books Worzel is married to Earthy Mangold. In the first book, Aunt Sally (his femme fatale in the TV series) is only mentioned in one chapter and the character is an antagonistic bully to Worzel. For the television adaptation, Worzel has a collection of interchangeable heads. In the books, the maker of Worzel Gummidge and other scarecrows is not named the Crowman, but is described as a mysterious figure.

The first section is characterized by the Eighty Years' War, which ended in 1648. The Golden Age continued in peacetime during the Dutch Republic until the end of the century. The transition by the Netherlands to becoming the foremost maritime and economic power in the world has been called the \\"Dutch Miracle\\" by historian K. W. Swart.  Causes of the Golden Age  Rembrandt The Night Watch (1642) In 1568, the Seven Provinces that later signed the Union of Utrecht () started a rebellion against Philip II of Spain that led to the Eighty Years' War. Before the Low Countries could be completely reconquered, a war between England and Spain, the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585-1604, broke out, forcing Spanish troops to halt their advances and leaving them in control of the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent, but without control of Antwerp, which was then arguably the most important port in the world. Antwerp fell on 17 August 1585, after a siege, and the division between the Northern and Southern Netherlands (the latter mostly modern Belgium) was established. The United Provinces (roughly today's Netherlands) fought on until the Twelve Years' Truce, which did not end the hostilities. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Eighty Years' War between the Dutch Republic and Spain and the Thirty Years' War between other European superpowers, brought the Dutch Republic formal recognition and independence from the Spanish crown. =Migration of skilled workers to the Dutch Republic= Fishing for Souls (Zielenvisserij), 1614, a satirical allegory of Protestant-Catholic struggles for souls during the Dutch Revolt (Rijksmuseum) Under the terms of the surrender of Antwerp in 1585, the Protestant population (if unwilling to reconvert) were given four years to settle their affairs before leaving the city and Habsburg territory. Similar arrangements were made in other places. Protestants were especially well-represented among the skilled craftsmen and rich merchants of the port cities of Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp. More moved to the north between 1585 and 1630 than Catholics moved in the other direction, although there were also many of these. Many of those moving north settled in Amsterdam, transforming what was a small port into one of the most important ports and commercial centres in the world by 1630. In addition to the mass migration of Protestant natives from the southern Netherlands to the northern Netherlands, there were also influxes of non-native refugees who had previously fled from religious persecution, particularly Sephardi Jews from Portugal and Spain, and later Protestants from France. The Pilgrim Fathers also spent time there before their voyage to the New World. =Protestant work ethic= Economists Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O'Rourke attribute part of the Dutch ascendancy to its Protestant work ethic based on Calvinism, which promoted thrift and education. This contributed to \\"the lowest interest rates and the highest literacy rates in Europe. The abundance of capital made it possible to maintain an impressive stock of wealth, embodied not only in the large fleet but in the plentiful stocks of an array of commodities that were used to stabilize prices and take advantage of profit opportunities.\\" =Cheap energy sources= A river landscape with fishermen in rowing boats, windmills beyond, 1679 Several other factors also contributed to the flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the sciences in the Netherlands during this time. A necessary condition was a supply of cheap energy from windmills and from peat, easily transported by canal to the cities. The inventionSaag Molens were invented in Uitgeest, according to the \\"Haarlemmermeer Boeck\\" by Jan Adriaanszoon Leeghwater of the wind powered sawmill enabled the construction of a massive fleet of ships for worldwide trading and for military defense of the republic's economic interests. =Birth and wealth of corporate finance= Syndics of the Drapers' Guild by Rembrandt, depicting wealthy Amsterdam burghers. In the 17th century the Dutch ‚Äì traditionally able seafarers and keen mapmakers ‚Äì began to trade with the Far East, and as the century wore on, they gained an increasingly dominant position in world trade, a position previously occupied by the Portuguese and Spanish.The maps used by Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba to attack Dutch cities were made by Dutch mapmakers. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was founded. It was the first-ever multinational corporation, financed by shares that established the first modern stock exchange. The Company received a Dutch monopoly on Asian trade, which it would keep for two centuries, and it became the world's largest commercial enterprise of the 17th century. Spices were imported in bulk and brought huge profits due to the efforts and risks involved and demand. This is remembered to this day in the Dutch word peperduur, meaning something is very expensive, reflecting the prices of spices at the time. To finance the growing trade within the region, the Bank of Amsterdam was established in 1609, the precursor to, if not the first true central bank. Although the trade with the Far East was the more famous of the VOC's exploits, the main source of wealth for the Republic was in fact its trade with the Baltic states and Poland. Called the \\"Mothertrade\\" (), the Dutch imported enormous amounts of bulk resources like grain and wood, stockpiling them in Amsterdam so Holland would never lack for basic goods, as well as being able to sell them on for profit. This meant that unlike their main rivals the Republic would not face the dire repercussions of a bad harvest and the starvation it accompanied, instead profiting when this happened in other states (bad harvests were commonplace in France and England in the 17th century, which also contributed to the Republic's success in that time). = Geography = According to Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O'Rourke, geography favored the Dutch Republic, contributing to its wealth. They write, \\"The foundations were laid by taking advantage of location, midway between the Bay of Biscay and the Baltic. Seville and Lisbon and the Baltic ports were too far apart for direct trade between the two terminal points, enabling the Dutch to provide profitable intermediation, carrying salt, wine, cloth and later silver, spices, and colonial products eastward while bringing Baltic grains, fish, and naval stores to the west. The Dutch share of European shipping tonnage was enormous, well over half during most of the period of their ascendancy.\\" Monopoly on trade with Japan The Dutch had the largest merchant fleet in Europe in the 17th century Amsterdam's dominant position as a trade center was strengthened in 1640 with a monopoly for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) for trade with Japan through its trading post on Dejima, an island in the bay of Nagasaki. From here the Dutch traded between China and Japan and paid tribute to the sh≈çgun. Until 1854, the Dutch were Japan's sole window to the western world.Sinnappah Arasaratnam, \\"Monopoly and Free Trade in Dutch-Asian Commercial Policy: Debate and Controversy within the VOC.\\" Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 4.1 (1973): 1-15. The collection of scientific learning introduced from Europe became known in Japan as Rangaku or Dutch Learning.Marius B. Jansen, \\"Rangaku and Westernization.\\" Modern Asian Studies 18.4 (1984): 541-553. The Dutch were instrumental in transmitting to Japan some knowledge of the industrial and scientific revolution then occurring in Europe. The Japanese purchased and translated numerous scientific books from the Dutch, obtained from them Western curiosities and manufactures (such as clocks) and received demonstrations of various Western innovations (such as electric phenomena, and the flight of a hot air balloon in the early 19th century). In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch were arguably the most economically wealthy and scientifically advanced of all European nations, which put them in a privileged position to transfer Western knowledge to Japan.Grant K. Goodman, Japan and the Dutch 1600-1853 (Routledge, 2013). European Great Power The Trip brothers, arms traders, built the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam, currently the seat of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, which is a typical example of 17th-century architecture. The Dutch also dominated trade between European countries. The Low Countries were favorably positioned at a crossing of east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth trade routes and connected to a large German hinterland through the Rhine river. Dutch traders shipped wine from France and Portugal to the Baltic lands and returned with grain for countries around the Mediterranean Sea. By the 1680s, an average of nearly 1000 Dutch ships entered the Baltic Sea each year, to trade with markets of the fading Hanseatic League. The Dutch were able to gain control of much of the trade with the nascent English colonies in North America; and after the end of the war with Spain in 1648, Dutch trade with that country also flourished. Other industries National industries expanded as well. Shipyards and sugar refineries are prime examples. As more and more land was utilized, partially through transforming lakes into polders such as the Beemster, Schermer and Purmer, local grain production and dairy farming soared. National consciousness The outcome of the revolt against Spain, better known as the Eighty Years' War, fought over religious freedom and economic and political independence, ended in total independence of the reformist northern provinces (see also Dutch Republic), almost certainly would have boosted national morale. Already in 1609 much of this was accomplished, when a temporary truce was signed with Spain, which would last for 12 years.  Social structure  Canal in Leiden In the Netherlands in the 17th century, social status was largely determined by income. The landed nobility had relatively little importance, since they mostly lived in the more underdeveloped inland provinces, and it was the urban merchant class that dominated Dutch society. The clergy did not have much worldly influence either: the Catholic Church had been more or less suppressed since the onset of the Eighty Years' War with Spain. The new Protestant movement was divided, although exercising social control in many areas to an even greater extent than under the Catholic Church.Derek L. Phillips, Well-being in Amsterdam's Golden Age (Amsterdam University Press, 2008). That is not to say that aristocrats were without social status. On the contrary, wealthy merchants bought themselves into the nobility by becoming landowners and acquiring a coat of arms and a seal. Aristocrats also mixed with other classes for financial reasons: they married their daughters to wealthy merchants, became traders themselves or took up public or military office. Merchants also started to value public office as a means to greater economic power and prestige. Universities became career pathways to public office. Rich merchants and aristocrats sent their sons on a so-called Grand Tour through Europe. Often accompanied by a private tutor, preferably a scientist himself, these young people visited universities in several European countries. This intermixing of patricians and aristocrats was most prominent in the second half of the century.Klaske, Muizelaar, and Derek L. Phillips, Picturing Men and Women in the Dutch Golden Age: Paintings and People in Historical Perspective (Yale UP, 2003). After aristocrats and patricians came the affluent middle class, consisting of Protestant ministers, lawyers, physicians, small merchants, industrialists and clerks of large state institutions. Lower status was attributed to farmers, craft and tradesmen, shopkeepers, and government bureaucrats. Below that stood skilled laborers, maids, servants, sailors, and other persons employed in the service industry. At the bottom of the pyramid were \\"paupers\\": impoverished peasants, many of whom tried their luck in a city as a beggar or day laborer. Workers and laborers were generally paid better than in most of Europe, and enjoyed relatively high living standards, although they also paid higher than normal taxes. Farmers prospered from mainly cash crops needed to support the urban and seafaring population. =Women's roles= A family portrait, second half of the 17th century The central role of women in the 17th-century Dutch household revolved around the home and domestic tasks. In Dutch culture, the home was regarded as a safe-haven from the lack of Christian virtue and immorality of the outside world. Additionally, the home represented a microcosm of the Dutch Republic, in that the smooth running of an ideal household reflected the relative stability and prosperity of the government. The home was an integral part of public life in Dutch society. Public passersby could clearly view the entrance halls of Dutch homes decorated to show off a particular family's wealth and social standing. The home was also a place for neighbors, friends, and extended family to interact, further cementing its importance in the social lives of 17th-century Dutch burghers. The physical space of the Dutch home was constructed along gender lines. In the front of the house, the men had control over a small space where they could do their work or conduct business, known as the Voorhuis, while women controlled most every other space in the house, such as the kitchens and private family rooms. Although there was a clear separation in spheres of power between husband and wife (the husband had authority in the public realm, the wife in the domestic and private), women in 17th-century Dutch society still enjoyed a wide range of freedoms within their own sphere of control. Unmarried young women were known to enjoy various freedoms with their lovers and suitors, while married women enjoyed the right to publicly shame their husbands who patronized brothels. Moreover, married women could legally reject the sexual desires of their husbands if there were proof or reason to believe that a sexual encounter would result in the transmission of syphilis or other venereal diseases. Dutch women were also allowed to take communion alongside men, and widows were able to inherit property and maintain control over their finances and husband's wills. However, a woman's sphere of authority still primarily lay in household duties, despite historical evidence showing certain cases of wives maintaining considerable control in family businesses. Manuals written by men instructing women and wives in various aspects of domestic duties proliferated, the most popular being Jacob Cats' Houwelyck. As evidenced by numerous 17th-century Dutch genre paintings, the most important domestic tasks performed by women included supervising maids, cooking, cleaning, needlework, and spinning.Vegard Skirbekk, \\"Fertility trends by social status.\\" Demographic research 18.5 (2008): 145-180.  Unmarried women  The Dancing Couple, by Jan Steen, 1663 As seen in art and literature at the time, unmarried young women were valued for maintaining their modesty and diligence as this time in a woman's life was regarded to be the most uncertain. From a young age, burgher women were taught various household related duties by their mothers, including reading, so as to prepare them for their lives as housewives. Dutch art at this time shows the idealized situation in which an unmarried young girl ought to conduct herself in situations such as courtship, which commonly included themes relating to gardens or nature, music lessons or parties, needlework, and reading and receiving love letters. However, ideals of the young women espoused by genre painting and Petrarchian poetry did not reflect the reality. Accounts from travelers described the various freedoms young women were provided in the realm of courtship. The prevalence of Calvinist sermons regarding the consequences of leaving young women unsupervised also spoke to a general trend of a lack of parental oversight in the matters of young love.  Married women and mothers  Dutch writers, such as Jacob Cats, held the prevailing public opinion concerning marriage. He and other cultural authorities were influenced by Calvinist ideals that stressed an equality between man and wife, considered companionship a primary reason for marriage, and regarded procreation as a mere consequence of that companionship. However, non- egalitarian ideas still existed regarding women as the weaker sex, and the image of the turtle was commonly used to express the separate spheres and strengths of both genders. In addition to supervising maids, cooking, cleaning, and prating needlework, women were also encouraged to maintain some financial control over domestic affairs, such as going to market and buying their own food. Maternity and motherhood were highly valued in Dutch culture. Mothers were encouraged to breastfeed their children, as using a wet nurse would prevent a bond from forming between mother and child. The Dutch believed that a mother's milk came from the blood originally in her womb and that feeding the infant such substances would also reap physiological and health related benefits. Seventeenth-century Dutch society dictated that children should first begin to learn religion at home. Therefore, along with their husbands, women used family meal times to discuss religious topics and to focus on prayer.  Old women and widows  Seventeenth-century Dutch culture maintained contradictory attitudes regarding the elderly, in particular, elderly women. Some Dutch writers idealized old age as a poetic transition from life to death. Others regarded aging as an illness in which one is gradually deteriorating until they reach their final destination, while some lauded the elderly as wise and people who deserve the highest forms of respect. However, treatises on behavior for elderly women and widows stressed not necessarily their inherent wisdom, but that they should maintain piety, practice moderation, and live a relatively secluded life. Unlike other European artistic traditions, Dutch art rarely depicts elderly women as disgusting or grotesque creatures, but rather they are idolized as figures of piety and purity whom the younger generations of women can look up to.  Religion  Laurenskerk in Rotterdam, c. 1664 Calvinism was the state religion in the Dutch Republic, though this does not mean that unity existed. Although the Netherlands was a tolerant nation compared to neighboring states, wealth and social status belonged almost exclusively to Protestants. The cities with a predominantly Catholic background, such as Utrecht and Gouda, did not enjoy the benefits of the Golden Age. As for the Protestant towns, unity of belief was also far from standard. At the beginning of the century bitter controversies between strict Calvinists and more permissive Protestants, known as Remonstrants, split the country. The Remonstrants denied predestination and championed freedom of conscience, while their more dogmatic adversaries (known as Contra-Remonstrants) gained a major victory at the Synod of Dort (1618‚Äì19). The variety of sects may well have worked to make religious intolerance impractical. Renaissance Humanism, of which Desiderius Erasmus (c. 1466‚Äì1536) was an important advocate, had also gained a firm foothold and was partially responsible for a climate of tolerance. Tolerance towards Catholics was not so easy to uphold, as religion had played an important part in the Eighty Years' War of independence against Spain (with political and economic freedom being other important motives). Intolerant inclinations, however, could be overcome by money. Thus Catholics could buy the privilege of holding ceremonies in a conventicle (a house doubling inconspicuously as a church), but public offices were out of the question. Catholics tended to keep to themselves in their own section of each town, even though they were one of the largest single denominations: for example, the Catholic painter Johannes Vermeer lived in the \\"Papist corner\\" of the town of Delft. The same applied to Anabaptists and Jews. Overall, the country was tolerant enough to attract religious refugees from other countries, notably Jewish merchants from Portugal who brought much wealth with them. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France in 1685 resulted in the immigration of many French Huguenots, many of whom were shopkeepers or scientists. However, some figures, such as the philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632‚Äì1677), experienced social stigma.  Science  Astronomer, by Gerrit Dou, c. 1650 Due to its climate of intellectual tolerance, the Dutch Republic attracted scientists and other thinkers from all over Europe. In particular, the renowned University of Leiden (established in 1575 by the Dutch stadtholder Willem van Oranje as a token of gratitude for Leiden's fierce resistance against Spain during the Eighty Years' War) became a gathering place for intellectuals. Jan Amos Comenius, the Czech educator and writer, was known for his theories of education, but also as a pioneer of Czech Protestantism during the 17th century. To escape the Counter-Reformation, he migrated to the Dutch Republic and is buried in Naarden, North Holland. Comenius accepted the invitation of Laurens de Geer to visit Amsterdam, where he lived the last 14 years of his life (1656‚Äì1670). He published his most important works there: 43 volumes in all, about half of his total output. French philosopher and mathematician Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650) lived in Holland from 1628 until 1649. He also had his most important works published in Amsterdam and Leiden. Another French-born philosopher, Pierre Bayle, left France in 1681 for the Dutch Republic, where he became a professor of history and philosophy at the Illustrious School of Rotterdam. He lived in Rotterdam until his death in 1706. As Bertrand Russell noted in his A History of Western Philosophy (1945), \\"He [Descartes] lived in Holland for twenty years (1629‚Äì49), except for a few brief visits to France and one to England, all on business. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Holland in the 17th century, as the one country where there was freedom of speculation. Hobbes had to have his books printed there; Locke took refuge there during the five worst years of reaction in England before 1688; Bayle (of the Dictionary) found it necessary to live there; and Spinoza would hardly have been allowed to do his work in any other country.\\" Dutch lawyers were famous for their knowledge of international law of the sea and commercial law. Hugo Grotius (1583‚Äì1645) played a leading part in the foundation of international law. He invented the concept of the \\"Free seas\\" or Mare liberum, which was fiercely contested by England, the Netherlands' main rival for domination of world trade. He also formulated laws on conflicts between nations in his book De lure Belli ac pacis (\\"On the law of war and peace\\"). Portrait of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek by Jan Verkolje. Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì1695) was a famous astronomer, physicist and mathematician. He invented the pendulum clock, which was a major step forward towards exact timekeeping. Among his contributions to astronomy was his explanation of Saturn's planetary rings. Extract of page 186 He also contributed to the field of optics. The most famous Dutch scientist in the area of optics is Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who was the first to methodically study microscopic life‚Äîhe was the first person to describe bacteria‚Äîthus laying the foundations for the field of microbiology. Extract of page 186 The \\"microscopes\\" were simple magnifiers, not compound microscopes. His skill in grinding lenses (some as small as 1mm in diameter) resulted in a magnification as high as 245x. Famous Dutch hydraulic engineer Jan Leeghwater (1575‚Äì1650) gained important victories in the Netherlands' eternal battle against the sea. Leeghwater added a considerable amount of land to the republic by converting several large lakes into polders, pumping the water out with windmills. Again due to the Dutch climate of tolerance, book publishers flourished. Many books on religion, philosophy, and science that might have been deemed controversial abroad were printed in the Netherlands and secretly exported to other countries. Thus during the 17th century, the Dutch Republic became more and more Europe's publishing house.  Culture  Osias Beert the Elder, Dishes with Oysters, Fruit, Candy and Wine, c. 1620/1625 Cultural development in the Low Countries stood out from neighboring countries. With some exceptions (notably Dutch playwright Joost van den Vondel) the Baroque movement did not gain much influence. Its exuberance did not fit the austerity of the largely Calvinistic population. The major force behind new developments was the citizenry, notably in the western provinces: first and foremost in Holland, to a lesser extent Zeeland and Utrecht. Where rich aristocrats often became patrons of art in other countries, because of their comparative absence in the Netherlands this role was played by wealthy merchants and other patricians. Centres of cultural activity were town militia (Dutch: schutterij) and chambers of rhetoric (rederijkerskamer). The former were created for town defence and policing, but also served as a meeting-place for the well-to-do, who were proud to play a prominent part and paid well to see this preserved for posterity by means of a group portrait. The latter were associations at a city level that fostered literary activities, like poetry, drama and discussions, often through contests. Cities took pride in their associations and promoted them. In the Dutch Golden Age, the meals of the middle class consisted of a rich variety of dishes. During the 15th century haute cuisine began to emerge, largely limited to the aristocracy, but from the 17th century onward dishes of this kind became available to the wealthy citizens as well. The Dutch Empire enabled spices, sugar, and exotic fruits to be imported to the country. By the late 17th century, tea and coffee consumption were increasing and becoming part of everyday life. Tea was served with sweets, candy or marzipan and cookies. A rich Dutch mealtime of the time contained many extravagant dishes and drinks. = Painting = Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring Dutch Golden Age painting followed many of the tendencies that dominated Baroque art in other parts of Europe, such as Caravaggesque and naturalism, but was the leader in developing the subjects of still life, landscape, and genre painting. Portraiture was also popular, but history painting ‚Äì traditionally the most- elevated genre ‚Äì struggled to find buyers. Church art was virtually non- existent, and little sculpture of any kind was produced. While art collecting and painting for the open market was also common elsewhere, art historians point to the growing number of wealthy Dutch middle-class and successful mercantile patrons as driving forces in the popularity of certain pictorial subjects.Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, Gardner's Art Through the Ages, Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, (2005): 718‚Äì19. This trend, along with the lack of Counter-Reformation church patronage that dominated the arts in Catholic Europe, resulted in the great number of \\"scenes of everyday life\\" or genre paintings, and other secular subjects. Landscapes and seascapes, for example, reflect the land reclaimed from the sea and the sources of trade and naval power that mark the Republic's Golden Age. One subject that is quite characteristic of Dutch Baroque painting is the large group portrait, especially of civic and militia guilds, such as Rembrandt van Rijn's Night Watch. A special genre of still life was the so-called pronkstilleven (Dutch for 'ostentatious still life'). This style of ornate still-life painting was developed in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as Frans Snyders, Osias Beert, Adriaen van Utrecht and a whole generation of Dutch Golden Age painters. They painted still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals. The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: Pronkstilleven Today, the best-known painters of the Dutch Golden Age are the period's most dominant figure Rembrandt, the Delft master of genre Johannes Vermeer, the innovative landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael, and Frans Hals, who infused new life into portraiture. Some notable artistic styles and trends include Haarlem Mannerism, Utrecht Caravaggism, the School of Delft, the Leiden fijnschilders, and Dutch classicism. = Architecture = The Kaaswaag (Cheese Weigh House) in Gouda, finished in 1667, was designed by architect Pieter Post (1608‚Äì1669), as was the Waag in Leiden. Dutch architecture was taken to a new height in the Golden Age. Cities expanded greatly as the economy thrived. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants who had made their fortune ordered a new house along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defense and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented fa√ßade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built; but most of them have not survived. Early in the 17th century late Gothic elements still prevailed, combined with Renaissance motives. After a few decades French classicism gained prominence: vertical elements were stressed, less ornamentation was used, and natural stone was preferred above bricks. In the last decades of the century this trend towards sobriety intensified. From around 1670 the most prominent feature of a house front was its entrance, with pillars on each side and possibly a balcony above it, but no further decoration. Starting at 1595, Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today. The most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were Jacob van Campen, Pieter Post, Philips Vingboons, Lieven de Key, and Hendrick de Keyser. = Sculpture = Dutch achievements in sculpture in the 17th century are less prominent than in painting and architecture, and fewer examples were created than in neighbouring countries, partly because of their absence in the interiors of Protestant churches, as objections to the Roman Catholic veneration of statues had been one of the contentious points of the Reformation. Another reason was the comparatively small class of nobles. Sculptures were commissioned for government buildings, private buildings (often adorning house fronts) and the exteriors of churches. There was also a market for grave monuments and portrait busts. Hendrick de Keyser, who was active at the dawn of the Golden Age, is one of the few prominent home-grown sculptors. In the 1650s and 1660s, the Flemish sculptor Artus I Quellinus, along with his family and followers like Rombout Verhulst, were responsible for the classicizing decorations for the Amsterdam city hall (now the Royal Palace, Amsterdam). This remains the major monument of Dutch Golden Age sculpture. = Literature = The Golden Age was also an important time for developments in literature. Some of the major figures of this period were Gerbrand Bredero, Jacob Cats, Pieter Hooft, and Joost van den Vondel. During this time, a climate of tolerance developed in comparison to other European states with strict censorship restrictions paving the way for the Dutch to become a powerhouse in the book trade. This transformation is described by modern historians as the 'Dutch miracle.' Additionally, the Dutch enjoyed high literacy rates, and Dutch entrepreneurs took advantage of this. As a result, seventeenth century Holland became a great centre for the production of news, Bibles, political pamphlets. Louis Elzevir and his descendants created what is considered one of the most eminent dynasties of the book trade. The House of Elzevir produced pocket editions of classical Latin texts which were scholarly, reliable, and reasonably priced. The Elzevir dynasty died out in 1712 and the 'Dutch miracle' waned as international competition caught up to the Dutch book trade.Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J.

The Guardian, 15 April 2011. Retrieved 29 September 2018 Bronowski's family moved to Germany and then to England while he was a child. In England, he won a scholarship to study mathematics at the University of Cambridge. His interests have been described as ranging \\"widely, from biology to poetry and from chess to Humanism\\".\\"Jacob Bronowski\\" (obituary). humanistheritage.org.uk. Retrieved 29 September 2018 He taught mathematics at the University College Hull between 1934 and 1942. During World War II he led the field of operations research and worked to increase the effectiveness of Allied bombing. After the war he headed the projects division of UNESCO. Bronowski wrote poetry and had a deep affinity with William Blake. From 1950 to 1963 he worked for the National Coal Board in England. From 1963 he was a resident fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, until his death in 1974 in East Hampton, New York, just a year after the airing of his Ascent of Man. Early life and education Jacob Bronowski was born to a Polish-Jewish family in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Congress Poland, in 1908. His family moved to Germany during the First World War, and to Britain in 1920, Bronowski's parents having been married in Britain in the London house of his maternal grandfather in 1907. Although, according to Bronowski, he knew only two English words on arriving in Great Britain, he gained admission to the Central Foundation Boys' School in London and went on to study at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated as Senior Wrangler.New Scientist profile 23 November 1961 p 483 As a mathematics student at Jesus College, Cambridge, Bronowski co-edited‚Äîwith William Empson‚Äîthe literary periodical Experiment, which first appeared in 1928. Bronowski would pursue this sort of dual activity, in both the mathematical and literary worlds, throughout his professional life. He was also a strong chess player, earning a half-blue while at Cambridge and composing numerous chess problems for the British Chess Magazine between 1926 and 1970. He received a Ph.D. in mathematics at Cambridge in 1935, writing a dissertation in algebraic geometry. For a time in the 1930s he lived near Laura Riding and Robert Graves in Majorca. From 1934 to 1942, he taught mathematics at the University College of Hull. Beginning in this period, the British secret service MI5 placed him under surveillance believing he was a security risk, which may have restricted his access to senior posts in the UK. Wartime work in military analysis Jacob Bronowski During the Second World War, Bronowski worked in operations research for the UK's Ministry of Home Security, where he developed mathematical approaches to bombing strategy for RAF Bomber Command. At the end of the war, Bronowski was part of a British team of scientists and civil engineers that visited Japan to document the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the purpose of studying the effects of the atomic bomb and its implications for future UK civil defence. Bronowski, in conjunction with Professor W. N. Thomas of the University of Cardiff, subsequently produced the secret \\"Report of the British Mission to Japan on an Investigation of the Effects of the Atomic Bombs Dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki\\" which was passed to various government departments and consulted in the design of future UK public buildings. Post-war biological analysis Following his experiences of the after-effects of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings, he discontinued his work for British military research and turned to biology, as did his friend Le√≥ Szil√°rd, and many other physicists of that time, to better understand the nature of violence. Subsequently, he became Director of Research for the National Coal Board in the UK, and an associate director of the Salk Institute from 1964. In 1950, Bronowski was given the Taung child's fossilised skull and asked to try, using his statistical skills, to combine a measure of the size of the skull's teeth with their shape in order to discriminate them from the teeth of apes. Work on this turned his interests towards the biology of humanity's intellectual products. Public science education In 1967 Bronowski delivered the six Silliman Memorial Lectures at Yale University and chose as his subject the role of imagination and symbolic language in the progress of scientific knowledge. Transcripts of the lectures were published posthumously in 1978 as The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination and remain in print. He first became familiar to the British public through appearances on the BBC television version of The Brains Trust in the late 1950s. His ability to answer questions on many varied subjects led to an offhand reference in an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus where one character states that \\"He knows everything.\\" Bronowski is best remembered for his thirteen part series The Ascent of Man (1973), a BBC television documentary about the history of human life and scientific endeavour. This project was intended to parallel art historian Kenneth Clark's earlier \\"personal view\\" series Civilisation (1969) which had covered cultural history. During the making of The Ascent of Man, Bronowski was interviewed on the British chat show Parkinson. Host Michael Parkinson later recounted that Bronowski's description of a visit to Auschwitz, where he had lost many of his family during the Holocaust, was one of Parkinson's most memorable interviews. Personal life Bronowski married Rita Coblentz in 1941.Lisa Jardine Obituary: Rita Bronowski [Coblentz], The Guardian, 22 September 2010 The couple had four children, all daughters, the eldest being the British academic Lisa Jardine and another being the filmmaker Judith Bronowski.

The company was launched as Southern Television Limited and the title Southern Television was consistently used on-air throughout its life. However, in 1966 during the application process for contracts running from 1968 the company renamed itself Southern Independent Television Limited, a title which was used until 1980, when the company reverted to its original corporate name. Southern Television ceased broadcasting on the morning of 1 January 1982 at 12.43am, after a review during the 1980 franchise round gave the contract to Television South. Launch When the Independent Television Authority (ITA) advertised for applicants to run the south of England station in 1958, Southern Television beat eight other applicants for the contract. Its initial shareholders were Associated Newspapers, the Rank Organisation and the Amalgamated Press, each holding one third of the company. Associated Newspapers was allowed to remain a shareholder in Southern only on the condition that it sold its remaining 10% stake in Associated-Rediffusion to avoid owning parts of two ITV companies. The Amalgamated Press dropped out of the consortium before the station went on air. This led to Associated Newspapers and Rank increasing their stakes to 37.5% each, and D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd taking the remaining 25%. Southern Television was the ninth ITA franchise to launch, beginning transmissions on Saturday, 30 August 1958 at 5.30 pm with the first playing of Southern Rhapsody, the station theme which was used to begin each day's transmission until 31 December 1981, written by composer Richard Addinsell and performed by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra with Addinsell conducting. The first presenter on air was continuity announcer Meryl O'Keefe (later to become a BBC announcer); her first on-air announcement was followed by an outside broadcast link-up fronted by Julian Pettifer (later a war correspondent) and a regional news bulletin read by Martin Muncaster. Other opening night programmes included a Filmed Playhouse drama entitled The Last Reunion, a preview programme called Coming Shortly, an episode of the American crime drama Highway Patrol and a networked opening night programme entitled Southern Rhapsody, starring Gracie Fields and the Lionel Blair Dancers, televised from the station's studios in a converted cinema in the Northam area of Southampton and the ocean liner Caronia, which was berthed in Southampton docks. Programming Programmes produced by Southern Television also included the regional news magazine Day by Day, presented by Cliff Michelmore, Christopher Peacock, Barry Westwood, Peter Clark, and long-serving weatherman Trevor Baker; Out of Town, a countryside programme introduced by Jack Hargreaves, who would later join Southern Television's board of directors; How, a children's science programme also featuring Hargreaves along with Fred Dinenage, Bunty James (later replaced by Marian Davies) and Jon Miller; Freewheelers, a children's spy series; Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years and Worzel Gummidge, starring Jon Pertwee as the eponymous walking scarecrow. Southern Television also produced a programme aimed at the farming community, presented by Mark Jenner, Farm Progress was broadcast at around 10:30 on Sunday mornings. A late-night epilogue was introduced by Roger Royle. Alongside 'Trevor the Weather', weather forecasts were also presented by Cyril Ockenden. Generally, the company produced more networked children's programmes than adult programmes, scoring a particularly strong seller internationally with an adaptation of Enid Blyton's The Famous Five. Also worth noting was the children's programme The Saturday Banana, hosted by Bill Oddie (then one of The Goodies) which saw the placing of a fibreglass banana outside the studios, supported by its peeled 'skin'; they also produced the children's game show Runaround which was hosted by Mike Reid. The broadcaster was known for its enlightened classical music broadcasting, including studio concerts by the local Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in Music in Camera.Burton H. Obituary for Dave Heather. The Independent. London, 21 April 2005. From 1972, Southern Television broadcast up to two operas from Glyndebourne each season, some of which have since been issued on DVD.Glyndebourne Festival 1979, programme book. It has been long rumoured, in particular among the amateur Archive community, that the Southern Television archive may have ended up as part of the, presumably unrelated similarly named, Australian company Southern Star, which in turn by 2018 could at least in part, have become part of the Endemol Shine Group's intellectual property and archive. However it was later clarified that the Southern Television archive had actually been sold by Southern Star on to Renown Pictures. Renown Pictures now use parts of this archive within their own channel Talking Pictures TV, showing old Southern Television programming, amongst other old film libraries that Renown now own. In its last three years on the air Southern showed many non-Anglosphere films in its Friday Late, Late Show, including as many as eight by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and others by Werner Herzog, Andrzej Wajda, Wim Wenders, Federico Fellini and many more. These were particularly valuable in the more rural parts of its region where these films were rarely shown in cinemas and home video barely existed. Studios =Southampton= The station's original studios were in a converted cinema, the Plaza, in Northam, Southampton. With the advent of colour in 1969, the company moved to purpose-built new studios next door to the existing site, built on land reclaimed from the River Itchen. The studios at Northam were sold on to TVS in 1981, and sold again by TVS to Meridian Broadcasting in 1992. Meridian relocated to a much smaller office building in Whiteley in 2004, and the site at Northam was sold to developers. The studio complex was demolished in 2010. Blocks of flats have now been erected on the site. =Dover= The company also ran production offices and a studio in Dover, to serve the eastern part of its region. The studios were opened in 1961, after the ITA's VHF Dover television transmitter went into operation the year before. The studios on Russell Street were mainly used for regional news production although some non-news programmes including the long- running rural affairs series Farm Progress, feature series and documentaries such as Elusive Butterflies and Dougalling and the nightly Epilogue (known for years as Guideline) were also produced from Dover. During Southern's tenure as the ITV franchise broadcaster, the company strived to produce dedicated opt outs for the East of the region ‚Äì the first British television service of its kind. Southern's South East news team in Dover produced separate bulletins for the area as an opt-out into the Day by Day programme each weeknight. A dedicated South East bulletin was also broadcast after News at Ten. More well known to South East viewers was Scene South East, a weekly magazine programme introduced on 9 October 1964 as Friday on Ten, which replaced Day by Day on Friday nights. Its popularity led to the introduction of a shorter Scene Midweek programme on Wednesdays from 1977 onwards. Local commercials specific to the region were also broadcast to the Dover transmitter only, via the presentation control area at the Southampton studios. Dover-based presenters and reporters included Mike Field, Jeff Thomas, Malcolm Mitchell, Tim Brinton, Simon Theobalds, Arnie Wilson, Jill Cochrane, Derek Williamson, Pat Sloman, David Haigh (editor of Scene South East), Donald Dougall and Mike Fuller. The Dover studio directors were David Pick and Maurice Harper. The floor manager was John Heather and the production secretaries were Gwenneth Hughes and Denise Hood. After Southern lost its franchise to TVS, the studios were used to produce the successor's regional news programmes for the South East ‚Äî Coast to Coast and TVS News. Once TVS's studios in Maidstone were opened, the Dover studios were closed in 1983 and demolished a year later. The site is now a car park. =Other facilities= Unique in ITV and reflecting the area's maritime history the company converted a Second World War motor torpedo boat into a floating outside broadcasting unit named Southerner. There were regional offices in Maidstone, Dorchester, Brighton and Reading. There were also sales offices at Stag Place, London and Oxford Street, Manchester. Identity Southern Television's logo is sometimes said to be a compass (with the directional station name and the fact that the bottom point on the logo is longest suggesting a compass pointing south in the direction of Southern Television's service area), however, the general consensus is that it is a star, named after the Southern Star and because Southern Television's final transmission showed the logo zooming off into the night sky. For the purposes of this article, the logo will be referred to as a star, to reflect what it is most popularly called. Southern Television's first identity featured an art deco style star which zoomed into screen before the bottom point extended downwards with varying tones. This was replaced in the early 1960s with a white rotating star against a black background against a drumroll jingle. This was again altered in the mid-1960s to the familiar star shape against a black background and accompanied by a jingle featuring a cacophony of noises. This shape formed from a circle, with the diagonal lines moving out and joining the circle and the horizontal and vertical lines being drawn last, with the name added last. This ident remained with the station until the end of its existence with some modifications, firstly the jingle was altered to nine notes on a guitar a few years later, and then the background was revealed to be blue in 1969 with the introduction of colour (blue was the background colour of the ident as used in black and white, being shot with black background and white star would have given too much contrast and overexposed the camera). This ident with blue background colour was maintained after the introduction of colour transmissions because this still provided a good contrast on black and white TV sets. This ident, occasionally supplemented by a subsequent caption stating 'The Station that serves the South', lasted until the company ceased transmission in 1982. In addition to these idents, a clock was used featuring a blue background and Southern legend, and for introducing links between programmes, in-vision continuity was utilised often. Continuity announcers included: *Brian Nissen (transferred to TVS in 1982) *Christopher Robbie (transferred to TVS in 1982) *Keith Martin *Gill Hewitt *Verity Martindill 1980 franchise round The 1980 franchise round required Southern Television to re-apply to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to continue to serve the South East from 1982. Competition was stiff, and in the end, Southern Television lost its franchise to Television South (TVS), a new consortium with fresh ideas and bold plans that were quite different from Southern Television's proposals. Southern's failure was met with anger and disbelief by its board of directors. Although the IBA gave its standard reason for such decisions‚Äîthat the competitor offered greater investment and a better mix of programmes‚Äîit was believed the station's non-local ownership may have swayed the balance against it. Another factor may have been the company's conservative nature and that, with a new decade just dawned, the south of England would be a radically different area; it was felt that Southern Television's application was more of the same tried and tested formula, which in time would not have reflected the possibilities for the area. Yet another possible factor was the incumbent's complacency: its original application was a mere 16 pages long. Tactfully the IBA invited Southern Television to re- submit, this time asking the company to go into more depth with its plans. TVS spent months trying to persuade Southern to sell its studios until it finally succeeded. TVS was forced to use portable office buildings (known as Portakabins) in Southern's car park (something repeated later by the winner of the 1991 franchise, applicant Meridian Broadcasting, now known as ITV Meridian, while it waited to take over from TVS). Southern finally agreed to lease its studios for the production of TVS programmes and sell them to TVS outright at the end of 1981. The handover was tinged with acrimony on behalf of Southern Television, which appeared to take its anger at the decision out on TVS rather than the IBA, which had made the actual choice. In Southern Television's final productions, Day by Yesterday (a Day by Day special) and And It's Goodbye From Us, a song was featured, composed and performed by Richard Stilgoe, deriding the incoming TVS as \\"Portakabin TV\\" and mocking TVS for choosing Maidstone as a production base in the newly enlarged dual region‚Äîdespite the fact that Southern Television itself had already purchased a site at Vinters Park in Maidstone for a planned studio complex, which it would have built had it retained its franchise. Southern Television sold the land on to TVS at a considerable profit. Closure of Southern Television Southern Television's final programme And It's Goodbye From Us ended at 12.43 am on New Year's Day 1982. The programme closed with a medley of songs \\"to suit the occasion\\" sung by Lilian Watson and performed by the Bournemouth Sinfonietta under conductor Owain Arwel Hughes. The show's presenter, long- serving continuity announcer Christopher Robbie, signed off from Southern Television with the words: Afterwards, the camera panned to show many of the on-air talent and company executives standing (rather solemnly) as their names were displayed on-screen and the \\"Southern Fantasia\\" (composed especially for the show by Jonathan Burton, and performed earlier on in the programme) played in Southern Television's final two minutes. When the piece came to a climactic end, the illuminated logo signs and lights on the set were gradually turned off, fading to the Southern Television Colour Production slide (being shown for the final time), which dissolved into the station's logo, spinning away into an animated starry sky. The acoustic guitar jingle played for what would be the final time with a deep extended echo, and the screen slowly and silently faded to black, remaining that way for close to a minute. There were no closing or shut-down announcements, no suggestions for viewers to switch off their television sets, nor even the customary playing of God Save the Queen. At 12.45 am the transmitters were simply, and abruptly, shut down, putting a permanent end to Southern's broadcasts after 24 years. Exactly 8 hours and 40 minutes later, Television South began broadcasting in Southern's former region. Southern Television's programme archive was sold to Southern Star Group, then Renown Pictures; the names \\"Southern Television Ltd\\", \\"Southern Independent Television\\" and \\"Southern Television\\", and the star device idents used between 1958 and 1981, all transferred to Art Attack and Finger Tips producer Nic Ayling in 2004. Southern Television now trades as an independent production company. In August 2008, ITV Meridian commemorated the 50th anniversary of Southern Television's first transmission with special reports on Thames Valley Tonight and Meridian Tonight (South and South East editions) alongside a half-hour programme presented by Fred Dinenage.

The Iguvine Tablets, also known as the Eugubian Tablets or Eugubine Tables, are a series of seven bronze tablets from ancient Iguvium (modern Gubbio), Italy. The earliest tablets, written in the native Umbrian alphabet, were probably produced in the 3rd century BC, and the latest, written in the Latin alphabet, from the 1st century BC. The tablets contain religious inscriptions that memorialize the acts and rites of the Atiedian Brethren, a group of 12 priests of Jupiter with important municipal functions at Iguvium. The religious structure present in the tablets resembles that of the early stage of Roman religion, reflecting the Roman archaic triad and the group of gods more strictly related to Jupiter. Discovered in a farmer's field in the year 1444, they are currently housed in the Civic Museum of the Palazzo dei Consoli in Gubbio. The tablets are written in the Umbrian language, and are by far the longest and most important document of any of the Osco-Umbrian group of languages, which are closely related to Latin. The tablets shed light on the grammar of this ancient dead language, and also on the religious practices of the ancient peoples of Italy, including the archaic religion of the Romans. Parts of tablets VI and VII appear to be written in an accentual metre, similar to the Saturnian metre that is encountered in the earliest Latin poetry. The complete text, together with a translation into Latin, was published in London in 1863 by Francis Newman and 1931 in a book by Albrecht von Blumenthal. They were translated into English and published by James W. Poultney in 1959. Although the general meaning of the tablets is clear, there are still many obscure and debated points and issues. The main difficulty in understanding the text is the insufficient knowledge of the Umbrian vocabulary. These are the only documents of the ancient religions of Europe and the Mediterranean which have come down to us in an almost complete state. Moreover, their content deals with the rituals (sacrifices and prayers) addressed to the highest gods of the local community and to some extent may reflect the common religious beliefs and practices of the Italic peoples. Consequently, a great number of scholars have devoted their efforts to reading and deciphering them since their discovery. As historical linguist Giacomo Devoto once described it, only Asia has documents of equal value.  Discovery  A farmer found the tablets in a field in 1444 and sold them to the city for two years' worth of farming rights. The content of the tablets concerns the religions and ceremonies that were celebrated at Iguvium, the town's religious organization and its boundaries. The first attempt at deciphering their meaning was made by Bernardino Baldi in the beginning of the 17th century, and he was followed by Adriaan van Schrieck who believed he had got possession of the oldest monument of the Low German language, and interpreted accordingly. Olivieri recognized the name of Eugubium in one frequently recurring word. Louis Bourget pointed out that one of the tablets written in the Etruscan letters corresponded in the main with two written in Roman letters. Karl Otfried M√ºller, in his great work Die Etrusker, showed that in spite of the use of Etruscan letters the language of the inscriptions was totally different from the Etruscan language. Lepsius added greatly to the epigraphical criticism of the tablets, and Lassen and Grotefend made several successful attempts at interpretation. And finally Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, summing up the labors of their predecessors, and working according to strict scientific method, brought the interpretation of the tables to a degree of perfection that could hardly have been hoped for. Epigraphic note The tablets are engraved on bronze. Analysis of the external appearance of the supporting material has led scholars to conclude that only tablets V, VI and VII were meant to be exposed in public. The other ones were cast as an archive document.On the holes bored on the last three tablets, Prosdocimi (p. 161) remarks they testify that the documents were meant for public exhibition. As this seems odd for ritual prescriptions it can be interpreted as a political operation of the Augustan period. They are inscribed in Italic alphabet derived from Etruscan (T. I to Vb 8) and in Latin alphabet (T. Vb 9 onwards, VI, VII). Date The study of the ductus (writing style), conducted by comparing the tablets with other inscriptions from the area of Central Italy, has allowed scholars to conclude that they date from no later than the end of the 3rd century for T. III and IV to the first half of the 1st century for the latest T. VI and VII.Adriano Maggiani in Aldo L. Prosdocimi Le Tavole Iguvine Firenze 1984. This may though be considered only a terminus post quem since a style of ductus may last in peripheral areas well after its inception and even well after its demise in culturally dominant areas has occurred. Prosdocimi above p. 153. Content Tablets I to V present their topic in a concise, matter of fact manner. Tablets VI and VII repeat the same subject of Tablet I in a much more detailed and diluted way, with apparent literary and encomiastic intentions and overtones. The content of the tablets is given below, in their relative order of antiquity as established by Newman on the authority of Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, which is identical to that recently indicated by A. Maggiani.In Aldo Luigi Prosdocimi Le Tavole Iguvine I Firenze Olschki 1984. =Tablets III and IV= Sacrifice to Puemonos Popricos and Vesuna. General prescriptions concerning the holding of the sacrifice, sacrifice of the ovis (lamb) to Puemonos and Vesuna near a sacred grove. Containing details on the choice of the ohtur (auctor, head, perhaps augur) of the ceremony, the dispositions of the ritual instruments, the ritual invocations for the safety of the city to Iove Patre and Puemonos, the distribution of the sacrificial meat and the libations. =Tablet II= Side a (b of Lepsius) (Lacuna at the beginning of the text). Sacrifice of an ox to Iove Patre, of a ram to Iovio? (Iuno according to Newman), of a lamb to Iovio (Iuno) and of a boar to Marte. The Hondia. Making of the arfertur. Preparations: readying of the victim(s), grains, strues, fertum;Strucla, ficla would be equivalent to the Latin terms denoting the sweetmeats always accompanying religious ceremonies in ancient Roman religion. Cf. Festus s.v. strufertarii. Literally ficla, ficula made into a shape. incense or meal, wine; salt, mola; mandraculum (white linen used to wrap the officiant's hand), vases; pure water; ignition of the fire at the ara. Petronian Feast to Hontos Iovios: sacrifice to Hontos Iovios of puppies, offers of wine, libation, partition of the meats and their exposition on a board. Holding and turning of the ara with the hands and offer of wine. Division of the wine, the strues and ferctum, the meats among the participants. Burning (or inhumation) of the puppies at the ara. Side b (a of Lepsius) Sacrifice and feast of the Attidian Brotherhood: Sacrifice of a pig and a ram to Iove at the time of the decuriae of month Semonius by the ten sets of families of each of the 12 regions. Sacred Epulum (feast) in honour of Iove Patre, started in town and profanated at the various fana with libations using the mandraculum. Vocian (Buck: Lucian) Feast to Iupater: Sacrifice of a calf to Iove Patre for the Vocian (Lucian?) gens of the Attidians. The sacrifice is conducted with the urfeta in one hand at the offering and the crencatro (augural implement comparable to the lituum but crossed (Newman), or toga wore slanted across the right shoulder (Buck)) in the right hand at the time of the slaughtering. =Tablet I= Side a Six triplet sacrifices to the Grabovian triad and the minor triad: After observing the birds on the before and the behind three oxen are sacrificed to Iove Grabovius before (without) the Trebulana Gate. Behind (within) it three sows are sacrificed to Trebus Iovio. Before the Tesenaca Gate three oxen are sacrificed to Marte Grabovie. Behind it three pigs are sacrificed to Fisus Sancius. A libation ensues. Before the Vehiia Gate three white fronted oxen are sacrificed to Vofione Grabovie. Behind the Gate three ewe lambs are sacrificed to Tefre Iovie. After the profanation of the lambs, the rump is offered in expiation and a libation for the tota, local community, ensues, on the two sides separately starting with the right side. After the profanation of the rumps is over the backs shall be profanated. Side b Two more triplet sacrifices to Marte Hodie and Hondos √áerfios in atonement for the citadel: At the Jovian grove after the shearing of sheep three male calves shall be sacrificed to Marte Hodie for the Iguvine people and tota. At the Coreties (Quiritius or Curiatius) grove three male calves shall be sacrificed to Hontos √áerfios. Henceforth the citadel will be expiated. If any anything vicious happened in the discharge of the rite the birds shall be observed, the rite shall be reinstated once again after returning to the Trebulana Gate. Review of the city militia and expulsion (exterminatio) of the traditional enemies of Iguvium (Tadinates, Etruscans, Nahartes, Iapuzcoi) by the arfertur and the two prinovatus (augures or their attendants): * Tadinates (ta≈ôinate(m)), refers to the Umbrians from Gualdo Tadino; Elena Isayev, Italy before the Romans\\" (2008) in J√∂rg R√ºpke (editor) A Companion to Roman Religion.Olivier de Cazanove (2008). Religion in Preroman Italy, in J√∂rg R√ºpke (editor) A Companion to Roman Religion. * Tusci (tursku(m)) refers to the Etruscans, with the possible meaning in Umbrian of boundary; * Nahartes (Naharku(m)), refers to the Umbrians from around the Nera valley in southeastern Umbria, from Nahar the ancient name of the river Nera. According to another interpretation, it refers to the Sabines east of Nahar/Nera river. * Iapuzcoi (Iapuzku(m), a tribe of unclear origin, on which there are various hypotheses: a people of the Adriatic side near Piceni at the borders with the Umbrians, Iapygians of southeastern Italy, or the Iapydes of Illyria. The first hypothesis is the most plausible. Four more triplet sacrifices: Near the small fontains three red boars shall be sacrificed to √áerfos Martios. On the Rubinian ager three she boars shall be sacrificed to Prestata √áerfia of √áerfos Martios. The sacred jugs, black and white, shall there be ordered and turned. Beyond the Sahata (Sahata is probably the area considered within the pomerium, possibly marked by a stream) three she calves shall be sacrificed to Tursa √áerfia of √áerfios Martios. The assignation of the place where to carry out the slaughter of the boars shall be decided according to the site upon which the officiant is watching, whether either behind on the Rubina or beyond on the Sahata. Three days later the people shall be assembled and three heifers sacrificed below the Forum of Sehemania (Semonia) to Tursa Iovia at Acedonia. One of the heifers shall be consecrated by the arfertur and two by the prinovatus. =Tablet V= Side a Duties of the arfertur: The arfertur must provide whatever is essential for the ceremony and select the victims. Fees to be levied for the performance of the rites. Whenever the banquet of the brotherhood takes place, the fratreks or the cvestor must put to votes whether the banquet was properly arranged. If the majority of those present think it was not, a further vote must be taken to fix the penalty for the arfertur. Side b Contributions to be made by two gentes to the brethren, and portions of flesh to be awarded them by the brethren on the decurial festival. =Tablet VI and VII= These two tablets repeat the content of tablet I while expanding it to include and expound the minutest details of the rituals. VI Side a Lustration of the arx Introductory auspices: as in I the sacrifice is to be preceded by the taking of the auspices. Formulae passed between the augur and the arfertur (legum dictio); warning against noises, interruptions, meddling; boundaries of the augural templum; formulae of announcement of the auspices (conspectio, nuntiatio); prescriptions applying to the ensuing sacrifice concerning the military rod (pirsca arsmatia), the disposition of the pots and the fire. 1\\\\. Sacrifice of three oxen to Iove Grabovios before the Trebulan gate. An opening prayer is followed by three long prayers in identical words for each of the three offerings to the three Grabovian gods and these by a general prayer in conclusion. Then follow prayers especially devoted to the rites connected with the sacrifice. 2\\\\. Sacrifice of three pregnant sows to Trebos Iovios behind the Trebulan gate: the prayers used in the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Side b 3\\\\. Sacrifice of three oxen to Marte Grabovios before the Tesenaca gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated . 4\\\\. Sacrifice of three suckling pigs to Fisus Sancius behind the Tesenaca gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Then an offering of cakes accompanied by specific prayers and ceremonies ensues (involving the use of the mandraculum, white linen cloth wrapping the right hand of the officiant): special attention is given to Fisus Sancius, patron of the citadel (ocre Fisia). 5\\\\. Sacrifice of three oxen with a white forehead (calersuf) to Vofionos Grabovios before the Vehia gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. 6\\\\. Sacrifice of three she lambs to Tefer Iovios behind the Vehia gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Then supplementary offerings follow, thereafter prayers and accompanying rites with vases on both sides of a trench. 7\\\\. Sacrifice of three bull calves to Marte Horse at the Iovian grove. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. 8\\\\. Sacrifice of other three bull calves to Hondos √áerfios at the Coredian grove. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Rites for the lustration of the poplo (people, i. e. city militia) and execration of the enemies: The auspices are to be taken in the same way as for the lustration of the arx. Holding the perca arsmatia (ritual staff) and the cringatro the arsfertur lights the fire then with the two assistants (prinovatus), who hold rods of pomegranate wood, marches with the victims along the Augural Way to the district of Acedonia. Proclamation is made expelling the alien enemies. The Iguvines are ordered to form in companies. The arsfertur and the assistants march about them thrice with the victims and the fire. At the end a prayer is made invoking misfortune upon the aliens and blessings upon the Iguvinians. VII Side a Sacrifice of three boars to √áerfios Martios at the Fontuli, accompanied by the prayers used at the Trebulan gate. Sacrifice of three sows to Praestita √áerfia at Rubinia, with the prayers used at the Trebulan gate. Ceremonies with the black vessels and the white vessels, the former meant to bring misfortune to the aliens, the latter to avert it from the Iguvinians. Offering to Fisovius Sancius with the prayersw used behind the Tesenaca gate. Sacrifice of three female calves beyond the Sahata to Tursa √áerfia of the √áerfios of Marte. The prayers used at the Trebulan gate are to be repeated. The profanation of the offerings must take place where the nuntiatio happened: either in Rubinia or beyond the Sahata. After three days the holder of the perca arsmatia and the two assistants pray silently for the execration of the enemies and the safety of Iguvium from the shrine of Tursa. Then heifers are set free below the Forum of Sehemenia: the first person who has caught any of the first three shall sacrifice them to Tursa Iovia at Aceronia for Iguvium. The prayers and rituals (offer of cereals, strues, fertum, persea) used at the Trebulan gate are to be repeated. Side b Obligations of the fratrexs and entity of the fine he must pay in case of omissions (300 asses). The religion of the Umbrians as reflected in the Iguvine Tablets =The triad of the Grabovii= The triad of the Grabovii is the highest group of deities of the Iguvian pantheon and looks to be strictly aligned with the archaic triad of Roman religion.Dum√©zil, Georges. (1954) Remarques sur les dieux Grabovio- d‚Äô Iguvium, Revue de Philologie 28 pp. 226-234Rosenzweig, Irene (1937). Ritual and Cults of pre- Roman Iguvium. London. The epithet Grabovius seems to be related to Etruscan crapis, ceremonial litter, which might derive from a word meaning oakwood.from Illyrian for oak or beech: cf. Russian grab beech; Macedonian Œ≥œÅŒ¨Œ≤ŒπŒøŒΩ wood of the oak. P. Kretschmer. Festschrift Bezzenberger, p. 89 ff., cited in Buck, above, p. 371. The triad is composed by Iove or Iove Patre, Marte and Vofionos. The identity of the last has been understood as corresponding to Roman gods Quirinus or Liber, the former from an IE root *leudh- meaning people,Vittore Pisani \\"Mytho-Etymologica\\" Revue des √©tudes Indo-europeennes (Bucarest) 1, 1938Benveniste, √âmil. (1945). Symbolisme social dans les cultes gr√©co-italique, p.7-9. Revue de l' histoire des religions, 129. as cited by Dum√©zil, Georges. (1977). ARR It. tr. La religione romana arcaica, p. 144\\\\. Milan.Olivier de Cazanove (2008). Religion in Preroman Italy, in J√∂rg R√ºpke (editor) A Companion to Roman Religion. the latter either directly from the Italic theonym Loifer or through the intermediary of the Italic or Etruscan interpretation of Greek god (Dionysos) Eleutheros, recorded also in the Etruscan theonym Tin Luth (=Iuppiter Liber) of the Piacenza Liver. The gods of the triad of the Grabovii receive in sacrifice three oxen (buf) outside the three town gates (Preveres Treblanes, Tesenaces, Vehiies before the Trebulan, Tesenacan, Vehiian Gate). Those to be offered to Vofionos are qualified as calersu, probably correspondent in meaning to Latin callidus, with a white forehead.Isidore Origines, cited by Newman above. =The minor triad= The gods of this triad receive sacrifices in correspondence with those of the major one but these gods are honoured within the town gates. Trebos Iovios corresponds to Iove Grabovios, Fisus Sancius to Marte Grabovios and Tefer Iovios to Vofionos Grabovios. They received sacrifices of three pregnant sows, three suckling pigs and three ewe lambs respectively. Only the identity of the second one is known with any degree of certainty from attestations of his existence in Rome and elsewhere in Italy. In Rome he is known as Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. It is odd that he is here associated with Mars while his association with Jupiter would seem more well grounded theologically . The topic has been the object of a study by Dominique Briquel: he opines the reason should lie in the repressive and henceforth military connotation of the notion of divine sanction of the law.D. Briquel \\"Sur les aspects militaires du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius\\" in Melanges de l'Ecole Francais de Rome Antiquite' 1979 pp.135-137. This aspect is particularly relevant as to the divine sanction of the town wall,Gaius Institutiones II 8. fact which is of primary concern in the content of the Tablets. Trebos in Trebos Iovios is usually understood as corresponding in meaning to Latin trabs, ridge of the roof. Tefer of Tefer Iovios is often explained as burner, from the IE root *tep haet. This interpretation though is very debated.The same root of Tefer is also found in names of rivers such as Tiber, Tifernus, placenames such as Tibur, Tifernum Tiberinum and proper names as Etruscan Tefaries or Latin Tiberinus, Tiberius and Tiburtus. The most likely etymology of these names is from Mediterranean word teba meaning hill. Hubschmid 1954, Alessio 1949. Both Benveniste and Dum√©zil have argued that the Iguvine triads are just another testimony of their three functional hypothesis of IE religion. In particular the sacrificial offerings roughly correspond to those of Rome in their three functional significance and the sixfold invocations of VIa 30 and 39, VIb 13 and 32 (nerf, arsmo; veiro, peiquo; castruo, fri: princes, priests; men, cattle; fields, land produce) show a direct connection to the sovereign, military and productive activities.Rolf Noyer PDF by University of Pennsylvania: Linguistics Courses 051 (online at: linguistics upenn.edu). =Other deities= Hondos Iovios Many scholars, from B√ºcheler to Prosdocimi, opine this deity is an underworld god of agricultural fertility and plenty on the grounds of the sacrifice of puppies he receives at his festival. Prosdocimi calls it the intermestruae cereales: the declaration of the dog is set at the climax of the feriae .TI II a 15-44. Aldo Luigi Prodocimi \\"L'Umbro.\\" in Lingue e dialetti dell' Italia antica (= Popoli e civilt√° 1. Italia antica VI) Roma e Padova 1978 a cura di A. L. Prosdocimi p. 713-717; 761-762. Hondra in Umbrian means under(neath), below. J√∂rg R√ºpke remarks the association of Hondos with Juppiter is one among the numerous in the tablets, in which a complex multilevel and hierarchic structure of relationship among theonyms is envisaged. This phenomenon would put the god into a sort of host‚Äìguest relationship with the one given in the attributive. In the case of Hondos this feature is apparent also in the fact that his cults at the Hondia festival take place in the Jovian Grove but those at the lustration of the citadel (when the god bears the epithet of √áerfios) in the Coredian Grove. √áerfos Martios, Praesta(o)ta √áerfia, Tursa √áerfia, Tursa Iovia These deities are invoked and receive sacrifices aimed at obtaining their favour for the protection of the arx itself, of the community and of the fields in connexion to the lustration rites of the Iguvian citadel at different locations of augural relevance. The rites concerning the Praestota and the two Tursae involve a complex of libations aimed at obtaining a twofold action: the safety for the Iguvine community and the offsetting and expulsion of its traditional enemies. The debated points are few as far as the Praestota and Tursa are concerned. The two theonyms correspond to the Latin Iuppiter Praestes, Iuppiter Praestitus, Iuppiter Praestabilis and the Lares Praestites. Tursa corresponds to god Terminus, being the deity that represents the boundaries of the city at different locations of augural relevance: these are without and within the city for Tursa √áerfia and Tursa Iovia respectively (TI I b; VII a). Such a meaning is connected to the Umbrian word for border, tuder: Tursa is written Tuda in the Etruscan tablets, the intervocalic d being pronounced as a weak rs (i.e.: ·∏ç). Dum√©zil on the other hand, on the grounds of the function of Tursa, a deity whose action is to scare, inspire terror into the enemies, opines the theonym derives from a verbal root equivalent to Latin terreo, I scare (interpreting accordingly tursitu, tremitu in VIb 60).G. Dum√©zil La religione romana arcaica Milan 1977 p. 222-223. There is no agreement among scholars on the meaning of the epithet √áerfios and as to whether this is also a theonym, i. e. √áerfos Martios is a god different from Mars or not. An inscription from Corfinium reads: √áerfom sacaracicer Semunes sua[d, \\"priest of the √áerfi and the Semones\\", placing side by side the two categories of entities, the √ßerfi and the semunes. √áerfos is most times associated to IE root *ker(s) and Latin theonyms Ceres and Cerus. This view though might create interpretative problems concerning the theology of Mars and of the two deities who in Rome are associated with the sphere of law and defence, i. e. gods Jupiter and Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. Georg Wissowa and Dum√©zil both underline that the derivation from root *ker(s) is not certain: Umbrian group -rf could have a different origin than -rs.G. Wissowa Religion und Kultus der R√∂mer Munich 1912 p. 192 n. 9; Dum√©zil Archaic Roman Religion It. tr. Milan 1977 p. 222-223. Derivation from IE root *kerr (horn) would seem to suit the functions of these gods. Marte Hodie; Hondos √áerfios Marte and Hondos appear also under these epithets. Here too the only certain indication is from Roman Heres (or Here) Martea, connected with heres, he who inherits and also dominus, the position of master of the house.Gellius XIII 23, 1 and 18; Festus s. v. p. 89 L; Ennius Annales 104 \\"...Nerienem Mavortis et Herem...\\" . Hendrik Wagenvoort Pietas.Selected Essays on Roman Religion Leiden 1980 p. 175. Some scholars though connect the epithet to Latin adjective fodius, he who destroys. The two gods both receive sacrifices of male calves in the rites for the lustration of the citadel at the Iovian and Coredian groves respectively; theirs are the last in the series of sacrifices after the two triads and before the execration of the enemies. God Hondos receives the epithet Iovios in II and that of √áerfios in VI. This fact raises the question of whether these epithets were used alternatively in connexion with local or temporal constraints. Another similar instance is that of Tursa √áerfia and Tursa Iovia, who are found without and within the pomerium respectively. Puemonos Pupricos and Vesuna of Puemonos Pupricos This divine couple appears only in tablets III and IV, the most ancient ones. Puemonos's name seems to be related with Roman goddess Pomona; moreover both the name itself and the epithet Popricos (Publicus) hint towards a universal fertility god, similar to Latin god Liber. Vesuna is also found on a coin from Marsian territory.Newman p. 4 citing Mommsen.According to toponomastic studies, Vesuna is a potamonym. i.e. a river-name in the hydronymy of Central Italy. =General remarks on Iguvinian theonyms= O. de Cazanove observes Iguvinian theonyms appear to be compound formations of two, three and four terms:Olivier de Cazanove in J√∂rg R√ºpke (Editor) A Companion to Roman Religion London Wiley 2007 part I chapter 4 p. 50 f. they may consist of a substantive plus an epithet (e. g. Hondos Iovios, Tursa Iovia, Puemonos Podpricos), of a substantive plus a possessive phrase plus epithet (e. g. Vesuna of Puemonos Podpricos) and of a substantive plus epithet plus possessive phrase plus epithet (e. g. Prestota √áerfia of √áerfios Martios, Tursa √áerfia of √áerfios Martios). In his view this situation is comparable to that of Rome where are recorded purely functional deities in the pontifical books. These divinities were invoked in the prayers according to the Roman rite as mentioned by Gellius:Aulus Gellius Noctes Atticae XIII 23, 2. \\"Lua Saturni, Salacia Neptuni, Hora Quirini, Virites Quirini, Maia Vulcani, Heries Iunonis, Moles Martis, Nerio Martis\\". These entities would be a concrete representation of the powers of their respective god. At Iguvium though the situation looks more complex and less fixed as Tursa and Hondos are alternatively √áerfian and Martian and √áerfian and Iovian respectively. Other theonyms Some other deities are known just because they are mentioned occasionally in specifying the limits of augural observation (included those of the town). These theonyms are for the most part known in Roman religion. They are Tursa and (possibly) Hulos in IV 17 and 19 respectively, Vestisios (Libasius) apparently god of libations, Hoios (cf. Latin Holus, Helus, Roman grove of Helernus in Ovid's Fasti II 67-68) god of vegetationHe may have a cave if carso Hoii is interpreted as cave of Hoios (Ancellotti & Cerri), but the most likely meaning of carso is ditch (Newman after A.& K.). and Padella (cf. Roman goddess Patella), goddess of opening sheaves in VIa 14. Possibly adjective deueia of Asa Deueia (VIa 9, 10) implies a cult of the sky under the name Dius, Dia, similar to that of Dea Dia outside Rome (Ancellotti & Cerri). =Priesthoods= The Attidian brethren had an arsfertur (literally the Umbrian equivalent of Latin adfertor, i. e. \\"he who carries something to somewhere\\", clearly referring to a role in the ceremonies, holder of the pirca arsmatia, ceremonial rod). Other mentioned offices include the fratrecs interpreted as curator arcae,Prosdocimi above p. 713 f. the cvestor and the prinovatus, probably agrimensors, attendants of the person who takes the auspices. An ohtor (auctor) is mentioned in T. III and IV: the term denotes the person responsible for the ceremony.Francis W. Newman The Iguvine Tablets London 1863 p. 1 and 24 citing Aufrecht and Kirchhof. =Rites= The tablets record different sets of rites held on different festive occasions: the main and recorded in greatest detail one is the annual lustration of the citadel (ocre, Latin arx) of Iguvium (Tablets I, VI and VII). This rite includes sacrifices to the Grabovian (major) triad and the minor one near the gates of the town, sacrifices to Marte Hodie and Hondos √áerfios at the two sacred groves of Iove and Coredios (interpreted as Quiritius or Curiatius) respectively, the lustral review of the people of Iguvium in arms, i. e. the city militia, the execration and ritual expulsion (exterminatio) of the traditional enemies of Iguvium and final sacrifices to √áerfios Marti(os), the Praestita √áerfia and the two Tursae, √áerfia and Iovia, at various locations without and within the pomerium. Tablets VI and VII relate the ritual actions such as circumambulations, libations, kneelings and dance in minute detail recording all the prayers and the other augural formulae. The older tablet I gives a more concise record. The ritual triple (three time) circumambulation with fire and the victims about the city militia looks parallel to the Roman ritual performed by king Tullius as described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.Carl D. Buck A Grammar of Oscan and Umbrian Boston 1928 p. 308 citing Dionysius Halicarn. IV 22. The most complex ceremonies are those concerning Tefer Iovios and Fisus Sancius. A summary is appended below. Tefer Iovios: Sacrifice of the ewe lambs with the usual prayers used for each god of the two triads. Offering of the persondro sorsom (suine) at the right foot of the gate with accompanying libation. Offering of the libations. Prayer to Tefer Iovios. Offering of the persondro staflare (bovine or ovine) at the left foot of the gate. Tripodium. Prayer repeated. Assigning of the prosecta (cuts of sacrificial meat). Assigning of the libation accompanying the persondro sorsale at the right foot where the sorso was offered to the god (profanated). Assigning of the libation accompanying the persondro staflare at the left foot as above. Burning or inhumation of the persondro sorsale. Burning or inhumation of the persondro staflare. Throwing away of the vessels used for the persondro during the prayer on the incense (or cereal meal). Fisus Sancius (here appealed to also as Fisovius = Fiducius): Sacrifice of three suckling piglets with the usual prayers, consecration with incense (or meal) and grains as at the Trebulan gate. Wearing of the mandraculum (white cloth) around the right hand by the officiant. Adding of the ficla and strucla to the prosecta. Placing of the sopo (offa) at the back. The officiant while kneeling offers the libation, the mefa and the spefa spilling them from the vessels. Prayer for the arx and the community. During the prayer libation and tripodium. Offering of the libation. Distribution of the prosecta and of the libation while kneeling. Crushing and spilling over the fire of the mefa, libation, sopa (possibly lower entrails). Milling while sitting, prayer over the milled incense or meal. The two profane and the two sacred jugs are disposed in rows.After Newman, Buck, Ancellotti & Cerri. Tablet II records various sacrifices to Iove, Iovio (or Iovia? Newman: Iuno) and Marte to be held in atonement of possible unknown ritual faults; the Hondia festivals on which occasion dogs were offered in sacrifice to Hondos Iovios; the feast to Hondos Iovios held by the gens Petronia (these last two festivals might in fact be one); the sacrifice and feast of the sodalitas of the Fratres Atiedii on which rams and pigs were sacrificed to Iove by the ten sets of families of the twelfth pomperias, districts of Iguvium; finally the sacrifice of a calf at the feast of Iove Patre held by the gens Vocia (Lucia). The tablet might be fragmentary, i. e. record only the final part of a ritual at its beginning. Here is the summary of the ceremonies at the festival of Hondos: Hondia (IIa 15-44): the sum of money for the kid(s) is to be raised among the dining tables at the published price the arfertur is to be made after observing the birds the kid(s), grains, strues, fertum; incense, wine, salt, mola; mandraculum, vases (consecrated and not or wet and dry), water (or ointment) are to be prepared the fire is lit on the ara the incense is consecrated offer of the kid(s) to Hondos Iovios, declaration of its purity the sopas of the kid are taken and the prosiciae (cutlets) divided upon the breadcrusts empty baskets are placed behind and the cereals before at the foot (of the ara) offer of the incense libation and tripodium tripodium near the vessels of wine chanting in turn nine times: \\"I honour Thee with incense and wine\\" bringing of the crusts with the entrails libation two cuts of the kid(s) are divided into three pieces or three times addition of strues and fertum offering of the dog prayer over the uncut flesh addition of strues and fertum to the flesh cuts offering of the kid(s); prayer in front of it prayer on the flesh, both uncut and roasted offer of the suppa on the plates prayer on the dedicatory jugs libation, tripodium, moving and placing down of the offerings suppas are placed behind, the flesh is taken by hand the incense is placed in two jars on the bracket breadcrusts, fried placentas, pots both containing water (ointment) and empty are brought over libation to Hondos Iovios from the jugs for the gens Petronia of the Attidian Brethren beyond the bracket prayer on the pure breadcrusts same wise prayer on the placentae, the pure jugs filled with water and the empty ones on the bracket libation and tripodium the bracket is moved aside; prayer on the pure water (ointment) hands are washed from the ara (or the ara is turned in the hands) back to the ara, near it silent prayer on the pure wine bringing and distribution of whatever the participants wish: wine, incense grinding of the strues, fertum; spilling of the incense or meal on the jar prayer on the whole and the ground grains the rite is proclaimed over the sacred rite is profanated the kid(s) is burnt near the ara.After Newman and Buck. Sacrifices of dogs were not common among ancient Italic people. Instances in Rome include the Lupercalia and a parallel may be found in the Augurium CanariumPliny Naturalis Historia XVIII 14. and the Robigalia, both held in late Spring for the propitiation of a good harvest and for the preservation of the grains from mildew respectively. According to the explanation given in Ovid by the flamen QuirinalisOvid Fasti IV 939-942. the dog was sacrificed because at the time in which the grains in the ears are in danger for the heat and draught the sun enters the constellation of the Dog: this explanation is erroneous. Another ritual aimed at protecting corn in danger from fires concerned foxes which were set afire in the Circus Maximus on the last day of the Cerialia (Cerealia).Ovid Fasti IV 691-712. Finally dogs were crucified on the Capitol at the beginning of August, time of the canicula to avert the rabies contagion or lessen their barking which disturbed sick people.Plutarch Roman Questions. Tablet III and IV record in minute detail the rituals of the festival of Puemonos Popricos and Vesuna at a sacred grove outside the town. Recently Michael Weiss has advanced the view that this was a new year ritual on the grounds of comparative material. =Treatment of the offerings= Latin sources concerning the cooking of the viscera underline the difference between the Etruscan and Roman customs distinguishing the exta aulicocta boiled in the olla extaris before the offering to the god, from the Tuscan exta roasted in veru and partly eaten during the sacrificial rite. At Iguvium the description of some sacrificial rites documents both the use of spits for the viscera and the presence of prosiciae displayed on the table of the offerings beside the fire and perhaps consecrated and burnt to the gods.Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae Paul Getty Foundation \\"Sacrifices\\" in \\"Processions, Sacrifices, Libations, Fumigations\\" p. 182. Augury Augural practices are presented in the tablets, most notably in the last two ones. They include the praeire verba, i.e. the uttering of the words to be repeated by the arfertur, the legum dictio, the rules for the taking of the auspices such as silence (silentium) and the avoidance of other incidents, the definition of the boundaries of the augural templum, the nuntiatio, announcement of the appearance of the expected signs from birds, the circumambulation of the army with fire. Tablet VI begins with an augural song. Here below is the text (VI 1-5): :Este persclo aveis asseriater eneto :parfa curnace dersua :peiqu peica merstu. :Poei angla asseriato eest :esso tremnu serse :arsferture ehuelto stiplo: :\\"Asseriaia parfa dersua, curnaco dersua, :peico mersto peica mersta :mersta auei mersta angla :esona\\". :Arfertur eso anstiplatu: :\\"Ef asserio parfa dersua curnaco dersua, :peico mersto peica mersta :mersta aueif merstaf anglaf :esona mehe :tote Ijoveine esmei stahmei :stahmeitei\\". Rules for the observation of bird signs are given in VI 15-18: below a certain boundary line (hondra esto tudero VIa 15) defined previously the augur must see and hear the verse of a parfa (parrha) and a crow; above that line (supu) he must see and hear a woodpecker peiqu and a magpie peica. =Augural terminology= Aveis asseriates Ia 1; aves asseriates VIa 1: avibus observatis, having observed the birds. persnaies, pusnaies Ia 1: antici, postici, (in the part) before and behind. dersua VIa 1: dextera, right hand, prosperous. The right hand was apparently seen as auspicious in Umbria as in Greece. Newman (Appendix II) cites the position of the augur in the inauguration of Numa, in which he faced east while Numa faced south. Right and left have both an auspicious and inauspicious meaning in Latin.Cicero De Divinatione II 39, cited by Newman p. 53. merstu VIa 1: iustissimus, rightest, most correct, propitious, superlative of mersos. Adjective mersos, from me·∏ços (literally medius),Adjective derived from PIE medh-ios middle, cf. Latin medius middle, central: M. de Vaan Etymological Dictionary of Latin and Other Italic Languages Leiden 2008 sv. means iustus (cf. Oscan meddix: supreme magistrate, iudex). Both words in Latin and Osco-Umbrian have a broader meaning than just, lawful: they may mean augurally correct, favourable, in agreement with the divine forces.G. Dum√©zil ARR It. tr. p. 91 n. 7 on the authority of Plautus. anglaf VIa 1: oscines, giving signs through their voice. stiplo, anstiplatu VIa 2, 3: stipulare, leges dicere, stipulate. mersta auei, mersta angla, esona VIa 3: most propitious birds (auspices), most propitious singing, divine. stahmei stahmeitei VIa 5: statio statuta, templum designatum, augural templum, the designed space of augural observation. neip mugatu VIa 6: ne mugito, muttito, that nobody shall make utterances, murmur. Silence is essential in augural practises,Festus sv. silentio surgere. nep arsir andersistu VIa 6: ne divis intersistito, that nobody shall come in between, barge in, between the divine (signs) and the augur. disleralinsust VIa 7: alteravit (e·πõali, erali=alter) render irritual, impair the auspice; attero VII a 11, 27: bad, unlucky.Festus s.v. alterum: \\" Alterum et pro non bono ponitur, ut in auguriis altera cum appellatur avis quae utique prospera non est...pro adverso dicitur et malo\\". \\"Other is understood as meaning not good, as in the auguria when a bird is named other i. e. not propitious... it is said for adverse and evil\\". Ehlich Zu indogermanische Sprachengeschichte p. 78 as cited by Buck p. 308. verfale VIa 8: formula of the templum. According to a new etymology de Vaan connects this noun to Latin cognate urbs, both having the meaning of defined space for augural observation, from a PIE root *u(o)rb(h) plus /d(h)-h(2) enclosure, enclosed area.M. de Vaan Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the Other Italic Languages Leiden/Boston 2008 sv. urbs citing Driessen 2001 and Meiser 1998. Cf. Hittite uarpa- enclosure. stahmito VIa 8: statutum, designed. tuderato VIa 8: finitum, defined, provided with boundaries. From noun tuder boundary, Etruscan tular. vapersus auiehcleir VIa 9: lapididibus auguralibus (ablative), (near) at the augural stones, rocks. tuder VIa 9: boundary, limit. anclar VIa 16: oscines. combifiatu VIa 17: conspectum capito, nuntiato, (the augur) shall announce the appearance of the auspices. Literally confidato. popler anferener VIa 19: populi recensendi, lustrandi, review of the levied army. Buck cites the parallel instance of the ritual circumbulation holding a lit torch performed by king Tullus Hostilius in Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities IV 22. perca arsmatia VIa 19: virga ritualis, ritual (and/or military) rod. perne postne sepse sarsite uouse auie esone VIb 11: antice postice septe sarcte voce (et) ave (i. e. auspicio) divina, from before and behind, clear and cut (fully, wholly) voice and bird sacred.Festus s. v. sarte p. 429 L: \\"Sarcte in auguralibus pro integre ponitur.

Lampropeltis elapsoides, the scarlet kingsnake, was formerly classified as the subspecies L. t. elapsoides, but is now recognized as a distinct species. The subspecies have strikingly different appearances, and many of them have their own common names. Some authorities suggest that this species could be split into several separate species. They are not venomous to humans. Geographic range They are distributed from southeastern Canada through most of the continental United States to Central America, south to western Ecuador and northern Venezuela in northern South America. Description Milk snakes commonly exceed in total length (including tail), with very large specimens known to reach total lengths of .Fischer, L. (2002).

They appear to be one of the smaller species of the kingsnake genus, as adults in the wild apparently average from in North America and most typically do not exceed a total length of . However, unusually large milk snakes can become rather bulkier than average-sized adults and potentially weigh up to , though high weights as such are generally reported from captivity.Hamilton, B. T., Hart, R., & Sites, J. W. (2012). Feeding ecology of the Milksnake (Lampropeltis triangulum, Colubridae) in the western United States. Journal of Herpetology, 46(4), 515-523.Fitch, H. S. (1982).

Captive reproduction in the Mexican milksnake Lampropeltis triangulum annulata. Litteratura Serpentium, 15(5), 128-132. Males typically are larger than females in maturity, although females can be bulkier than males similar in length, as well.Shine, R. (1994). Sexual size dimorphism in snakes revisited. Copeia, 326-346. Generally more tropical populations, from Mexico and further south, reach larger adult sizes than milk snakes living in the temperate zones.Williams, K. L. (1994). Lampropeltis triangulum. Catalogue of American Amphibians and Reptiles (CAAR). They have smooth and shiny scales and their typical color pattern is alternating bands of red-black-yellow or white-black- red. However, red blotches instead of bands are seen in some populations. Some milk snakes have a striking resemblance to coral snakes, in Batesian mimicry, which likely scares away potential predators. Both milk snakes and coral snakes possess transverse bands of red, black, and yellow. Experts now recognize that common mnemonics that people use to distinguish between the deadly coral snake and the harmless milk snake are not 100% reliable. Some coral snakes do not have the typical banding colors or patterns. Examples of unreliable mnemonics commonly used: :*\\"Red on yellow kill a fellow. Red on black venom lack\\" or \\"Red touches black, it's a friend of Jack. Red touches yellow, it's bad for a fellow.\\" Medical-Surgical Nursing: Patient-Centered Collaborative Care by Donna D. Ignatavicius, M. Linda Workman (page 125s) A juvenile eastern milk snake (L. t. triangulum) A young milk snake found in central Tennessee that has just eaten a lizard Due to the many colors of the eastern milk snake (L. t. triangulum), it can resemble the coral snake, corn snake, fox snake, scarlet snake, and most importantly, the venomous snake genera Agkistrodon and Sistrurus. Milk, fox, and scarlet snakes are killed because of a resemblance to the venomous pygmy rattlers. Juvenile milk snakes, which are more reddish than adults, are often killed because they are mistaken for copperheads. Enough distinction exists among the five to make the eastern milk snake fairly easy to identify. The eastern milk snakes also have a light- colored, V-shaped or Y-shaped patch on their necks. One subspecies is melanistic (almost all black). Habitat Across the wide range of this species, habitat varies. Typically, milk snakes live in forested regions; however, in some regions, they can be located in open prairies. In various parts across their distribution, milk snakes often live on rocky slopes. In some situations, milk snakes also migrate seasonally, during the winter they move to higher and drier habitats for hibernation and moister habitats for the summer. Milk snakes enter hibernation from late October or November to mid- April. Behavior Milk snakes are mostly nocturnal especially during summer months. They are primarily terrestrial and attempt to blend in with ground litter. They tend to be secretive and remain hidden. When threatened, a milk snake will usually first try to escape. If cornered or harassed, it may vibrate its tail and strike energetically, though of course they are non- venomous, have only tiny teeth and their tails lack a rattle. Unless frightened, milk snakes move slowly. They are able to climb and swim. Diet Young milk snakes typically eat slugs, insects, crickets, and earthworms. Adults' diet frequently includes lizards (especially skinks), and small mammals. Juveniles in the western United States generally feed on small lizards. They are also known to eat birds and their eggs, frogs, fish, and other snakes. Milk snakes are much more opportunistic eaters than the fox snake or corn snake. They have been known to consume a variety of animals, including rodents, eggs, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. Nevertheless, the diet of an adult milk snake still primarily consists of rodents. They are nocturnal eaters and are often found during the day in old barns and under wood. An early myth about milk snakes is that they suck cow udders to get the milk. The myth is entirely false, and is discredited by the fact that the milk snake does not have the physical capabilities to suck milk out of a cow. Milk snakes are, however, frequently found in and around barns, making use of their cool and dark environments, and for the easily accessed populations of rodents to feed on. This proximity to barns, and therefore cows, probably gave rise to the myth. Reproduction Milk snakes are oviparous, laying an average of about 10 eggs per clutch, although that number may vary by region. The milk snake mates from early May to late June. In June and July, the female lays three to 24 eggs beneath logs, boards, rocks, and rotting vegetation. The eggs are oval in shape, and white in color. Eggs range from 2.5 cm to 4.2 cm (1 to 1.7 in) in length. The eggs incubate for about two months, and hatch around August or September. Milk snakes typically live around 12 years, or up to 21 years in captivity. They reach their maturity within three or four years. The average hatchling in Virginia measures in total length and weighs .Linzey, D. W., & Clifford, M. J. (2002). Snakes of Virginia. University of Virginia Press. Conservation status The milk snake is listed as of least concern by the IUCN (a wildlife conservation union), but in some areas, they may face significant pressure due to pet-trade collection. Because of this species' attractiveness in the pet trade, many subspecies are now being bred in captivity for sale.

While it has been influential in research circles (influencing the designs of languages such as Java, C#, and Python) it has not been adopted widely in industry. It was designed by Luca Cardelli, James Donahue, Lucille Glassman, Mick Jordan (before at the Olivetti Software Technology Laboratory), Bill Kalsow and Greg Nelson at the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Systems Research Center (SRC) and the Olivetti Research Center (ORC) in the late 1980s. Modula-3's main features are simplicity and safety while preserving the power of a systems-programming language. Modula-3 aimed to continue the Pascal tradition of type safety, while introducing new constructs for practical real-world programming. In particular Modula-3 added support for generic programming (similar to templates), multithreading, exception handling, garbage collection, object- oriented programming, partial revelation, and explicit marking of unsafe code. The design goal of Modula-3 was a language that implements the most important features of modern imperative programming languages in quite basic forms. Thus allegedly dangerous and complicating features such as multiple inheritance and operator overloading were omitted. Historical development The Modula-3 project started in November 1986 when Maurice Wilkes wrote to Niklaus Wirth with some ideas for a new version of Modula. Wilkes had been working at DEC just prior to this point, and had returned to England and joined Olivetti's Research Strategy Board. Wirth had already moved on to Oberon, but had no problems with Wilkes's team continuing development under the Modula name. The language definition was completed in August 1988, and an updated version in January 1989. Compilers from DEC and Olivetti soon followed, and 3rd party implementations after that. Its design was heavily influenced by work on the Modula-2+ language in use at SRC and at the Acorn Computers Research Center (ARC, later ORC when Olivetti acquired Acorn) at the time, which was the language in which the operating system for the DEC Firefly multiprocessor VAX workstation was written and in which the Acorn Compiler for Acorn C and Modula Execution Library (CAMEL) at ARC for the ARX operating system project of ARM based Acorn Archimedes range of computers was written. As the revised Modula-3 Report states, the language was influenced by other languages such as Mesa, Cedar, Object Pascal, Oberon and Euclid.Modula-3 report (revised) Luca Cardelli, James Donahue, Lucille Glassman, Mick Jordan, Bill Kalsow, Greg Nelson. DEC Systems Research Center (SRC) Research Report 52 (November 1989) During the 1990s, Modula-3 gained considerable currency as a teaching language, but it was never widely adopted for industrial use. Contributing to this may have been the demise of DEC, a key Modula-3 supporter (especially when it ceased to maintain it effectively before DEC was sold to Compaq in 1998). In any case, in spite of Modula-3's simplicity and power, it appears that there was little demand for a procedural compiled language with restricted implementation of object-oriented programming. For a time, a commercial compiler named CM3 maintained by one of the chief implementors prior at DEC SRC who was hired before DEC being sold to Compaq, an integrated development environment (IDE) named Reactor and an extensible Java virtual machine (licensed in binary code and source code formats and buildable with Reactor) were offered by Critical Mass, Inc., but that company ceased active operations in 2000 and gave some of the source code of its products to Software Solutions GmbH. Modula-3 is now taught in universities mostly in comparative programming language courses, and its textbooks are out of print. Essentially the only corporate supporter of Modula-3 is , which inherited the sources from Critical Mass and has since made several releases of the CM3 system in source and binary code. The Reactor IDE has been open source released after several years it had not, with the new name CM3-IDE. In March 2002, also took over the repository of another active Modula-3 distribution, PM3, until then maintained at the √âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al but which later continued by the work on HM3 improved over the years later until it was obsoleted. Syntax A common example of a language's syntax is the \\"Hello, World!\\" program. MODULE Main; IMPORT IO; BEGIN IO.Put(\\"Hello World \\") END Main. All programs in Modula-3 have at least a module file, while most also include an interface file that is used by clients to access data from the module. As in other languages, a Modula-3 program must export a Main module, which can either be a file named Main.m3, or a file can call \`EXPORT\` to export the Main module. MODULE Foo EXPORTS Main Module file names are advised to be the same as the name in source code. If they differ, the compiler only emits a warning. Other conventions in the syntax include naming the exported type of an interface \`T\`, since types are usually qualified by their full names, so a type \`T\` inside a module named Foo will be named \`Foo.T\`. This aids in readability. Another similar convention is naming a public object \`Public\` as in the OOP examples above. Language features =Modularity= First and foremost, all compiled units are either \`INTERFACE\` or implementation \`MODULE\`s, of one flavor or another. An interface compiled unit, starting with the keyword \`INTERFACE\`, defines constants, types, variables, exceptions, and procedures. The implementation module, starting with the keyword \`MODULE\`, provides the code, and any further constants, types, or variables needed to implement the interface. By default, an implementation module will implement the interface of the same name, but a module may explicitly \`EXPORT\` to a module not of the same name. For example, the main program exports an implementation module for the Main interface. MODULE HelloWorld EXPORTS Main; IMPORT IO; BEGIN IO.Put(\\"Hello World \\") END HelloWorld. Any compiled unit may \`IMPORT\` other interfaces, although circular imports are forbidden. This may be resolved by doing the import from the implementation MODULE. The entities within the imported module may be imported, instead of only the module name, using the \`FROM Module IMPORT Item [, Item]*\` syntax: MODULE HelloWorld EXPORTS Main; FROM IO IMPORT Put; BEGIN Put(\\"Hello World \\") END HelloWorld. Typically, one only imports the interface, and uses the 'dot' notation to access the items within the interface (similar to accessing the fields within a record). A typical use is to define one data structure (record or object) per interface along with any support procedures. Here the main type will get the name 'T', and one uses as in \`MyModule.T\`. In the event of a name collision between an imported module and other entity within the module, the reserved word \`AS\` can be used as in \`IMPORT CollidingModule AS X;\` =Safe vs unsafe= Some ability is deemed unsafe, where the compiler can no longer guarantee that results will be consistent; for example, when interfacing to the C language. The keyword \`UNSAFE\` prefixed in front of \`INTERFACE\` or \`MODULE\`, may be used to tell the compiler to enable certain low level features of the language. For example, an unsafe operation is bypassing the type system using \`LOOPHOLE\` to copy the bits of an integer into a floating point \`REAL\` number. An interface that imports an unsafe module must also be unsafe. A safe interface may be exported by an unsafe implementation module. This is the typical use when interfacing to external libraries, where two interfaces are built: one unsafe, the other safe. =Generics= A generic interface and its corresponding generic module, prefix the \`INTERFACE\` or \`MODULE\` keyword with \`GENERIC\`, and take as formal arguments other interfaces. Thus (like C++ templates) one can easily define and use abstract data types, but unlike C++, the granularity is at the module level. An interface is passed to the generic interface and implementation modules as arguments, and the compiler will generate concrete modules. For example, one could define a GenericStack, then instantiate it with interfaces such as \`IntegerElem\`, or \`RealElem\`, or even interfaces to Objects, as long as each of those interfaces defines the properties needed by the generic modules. The bare types \`INTEGER\`, or \`REAL\` can't be used, because they are not modules, and the system of generics is based on using modules as arguments. By comparison, in a C++ template, a bare type would be used. FILE: IntegerElem.i3 INTERFACE IntegerElem; CONST Name = \\"Integer\\"; TYPE T = INTEGER; PROCEDURE Format(x: T): TEXT; PROCEDURE Scan(txt: TEXT; VAR x: T): BOOLEAN; END IntegerElem. FILE: GenericStack.ig GENERIC INTERFACE GenericStack(Element); (* Here Element.T is the type to be stored in the generic stack. *) TYPE T = Public OBJECT; Public = OBJECT METHODS init(): TStack; format(): TEXT; isEmpty(): BOOLEAN; count(): INTEGER; push(elm: Element.T); pop(VAR elem: Element.T): BOOLEAN; END; END GenericStack. FILE: GenericStack.mg GENERIC MODULE GenericStack(Element); < ... generic implementation details... > PROCEDURE Format(self: T): TEXT = VAR str: TEXT; BEGIN str := Element.Name & \\"Stack{\\"; FOR k := 0 TO self.n -1 DO IF k > 0 THEN str := str & \\", \\"; END; str := str & Element.Format(self.arr[k]); END; str := str & \\"};\\"; RETURN str; END Format; < ... more generic implementation details... > END GenericStack. FILE: IntegerStack.i3 INTERFACE IntegerStack = GenericStack(IntegerElem) END IntegerStack. FILE: IntegerStack.m3 MODULE IntegerStack = GenericStack(IntegerElem) END IntegerStack. =Traceability= Any identifier can be traced back to where it originated, unlike the 'include' feature of other languages. A compiled unit must import identifiers from other compiled units, using an \`IMPORT\` statement. Even enumerations make use of the same 'dot' notation as used when accessing a field of a record. INTERFACE A; TYPE Color = {Black, Brown, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Gray, White}; END A; MODULE B; IMPORT A; FROM A IMPORT Color; VAR aColor: A.Color; (* Uses the module name as a prefix *) theColor: Color; (* Does not have the module name as a prefix *) anotherColor: A.Color; BEGIN aColor := A.Color.Brown; theColor := Color.Red; anotherColor := Color.Orange; (* Can't simply use Orange *) END B. =Dynamic allocation= Modula-3 supports the allocation of data at runtime. There are two kinds of memory that can be allocated, \`TRACED\` and \`UNTRACED\`, the difference being whether the garbage collector can see it or not. \`NEW()\` is used to allocate data of either of these classes of memory. In an \`UNSAFE\` module, \`DISPOSE\` is available to free untraced memory. =Object-oriented= Object-oriented programming techniques may be used in Modula-3, but their use is not needed. Many of the other features provided in Modula-3 (modules, generics) can usually take the place of object-orientation. Object support is intentionally kept to its simplest terms. An object type (termed a \\"class\\" in other object-oriented languages) is introduced with the \`OBJECT\` declaration, which has essentially the same syntax as a \`RECORD\` declaration, although an object type is a reference type, whereas RECORDs in Modula-3 are not (similar to structs in C). Exported types are usually named T by convention, and create a separate \\"Public\\" type to expose the methods and data. For example: INTERFACE Person; TYPE T <: Public; Public = OBJECT METHODS getAge(): INTEGER; init(name: TEXT; age: INTEGER): T; END; END Person. This defines an interface \`Person\` with two types, \`T\`, and \`Public\`, which is defined as an object with two methods, \`getAge()\` and \`init()\`. \`T\` is defined as a subtype of \`Public\` by the use of the \`<:\` operator. To create a new \`Person.T\` object, use the built in procedure \`NEW\` with the method \`init()\` as VAR jim := NEW(Person.T).init(\\"Jim\\", 25); Modula-3's \`REVEAL\` construct provides a conceptually simple and clean yet very powerful mechanism for hiding implementation details from clients, with arbitrarily many levels of friendliness. Use \`REVEAL\` to show the full implementation of the \`Person\` interface from above. MODULE Person; REVEAL T = Public BRANDED OBJECT name: TEXT; (* These two variables *) age: INTEGER; (* are private. *) OVERRIDES getAge := Age; init := Init; END; PROCEDURE Age(self: T): INTEGER = BEGIN RETURN self.age; END Age; PROCEDURE Init(self: T; name: TEXT; age: INTEGER): T = BEGIN self.name := name; self.age := age; RETURN self; END Init; BEGIN END Person. Note the use of the \`BRANDED\` keyword, which \\"brands\\" objects to make them unique as to avoid structural equivalence. \`BRANDED\` can also take a string as an argument, but when omitted, a unique string is generated for you. Modula-3 is one of a few programming languages which requires external references from a module to be strictly qualified. That is, a reference in module \`A\` to the object \`x\` exported from module \`B\` must take the form \`B.x\`. In Modula-3, it is impossible to import all exported names from a module. Because of the language's requirements on name qualification and method overriding, it is impossible to break a working program simply by adding new declarations to an interface (any interface). This makes it possible for large programs to be edited concurrently by many programmers with no worries about naming conflicts; and it also makes it possible to edit core language libraries with the firm knowledge that no extant program will be broken in the process. =Exceptions= Exception handling is based on a \`TRY\`...\`EXCEPT\` block system, which has since become common. One feature that has not been adopted in other languages, with the notable exceptions of Delphi, Python, Scala and Visual Basic.NET, is that the \`EXCEPT\` construct defined a form of switch statement with each possible exception as a case in its own EXCEPT clause. Modula-3 also supports a \`LOOP\`...\`EXIT\`...\`END\` construct that loops until an \`EXIT\` occurs, a structure equivalent to a simple loop inside a \`TRY\`...\`EXCEPT\` clause. =Multi-threaded= The language supports the use of multi-threading, and synchronization between threads. There is a standard module within the runtime library (m3core) named Thread, which supports the use of multi-threaded applications. The Modula-3 runtime may make use of a separate thread for internal tasks such as garbage collection. A built-in data structure \`MUTEX\` is used to synchronize multiple threads and protect data structures from simultaneous access with possible corruption or race conditions. The \`LOCK\` statement introduces a block in which the mutex is locked. Unlocking a \`MUTEX\` is implicit by the code execution locus's leaving the block. The \`MUTEX\` is an object, and as such, other objects may be derived from it. For example, in the input/output (I/O) section of the library libm3, readers and writers (Rd.T, and Wr.T) are derived from MUTEX, and they lock themselves before accessing or modifying any internal data such as buffers. =Summary= In summary, the language features: *Modules and interfaces *Explicit marking of unsafe code *Generics *Automatic garbage collection *Strong typing, structural equivalence of types *Objects *Exceptions *Threads Modula-3 is one of the rare languages whose evolution of features is documented. In Systems Programming with Modula-3, four essential points of the language design are intensively discussed. These topics are: structural vs. name equivalence, subtyping rules, generic modules, and parameter modes like \`READONLY\`. Standard library features Continuing a trend started with the C language, many of the features needed to write real programs were left out of the language definition and instead provided via a standard library set. Most of the interfaces below are described in detail inSome Useful Modula-3 Interfaces Jim Horning, Bill Kalsow, Paul McJones, Greg Nelson. DEC Systems Research Center (SRC) Research Report 113 (December 1993) Standard libraries providing the following features. These are called standard interfaces and are required (must be provided) in the language. * Text: Operations on immutable string references, called \`TEXT\`s * Thread: Operations relating to threading, including \`MUTEX\`, condition variable, and thread pausing. The threading library provides pre-emptive threads switching * Word: Bitwise operations on unsigned integers (or machine words). Normally implemented directly by the compiler * Floating-point interfaces Some recommended interfaces implemented in the available implementations but are not required * Lex: For parsing number and other data * Fmt: Formatting various datatypes for printing * Pkl (or Pickle): Object serialization of any reference types reachable by the garbage collector * Table: Generic modules for maps As in C, I/O is also provided via libraries, in Modula-3 called \`Rd\` and \`Wr\`. The object-oriented design of the Rd (readers) and Wr (writers) libraries is covered in detail in the book by Greg Nelson. An interesting aspect of Modula-3 is that it is one of few programming languages which standard libraries have been formally verified not to contain various types of bugs, including locking bugs. This was done under the auspices of the Larch/Modula-3 (see Larch family)LM3 Kevin D. Jones.

It has been used to build distributed applications, computer animations, and web programming applications in the form of scripting extension to Modula-3. Influences on other programming languages Although Modula-3 did not gain mainstream status, several parts of the DEC-SRC M3 distribution did. Probably the most influential part was the Network Objects library, which formed the basis for Java's first Remote Method Invocation (RMI) implementation, including the network protocol. Only when Sun moved from the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard to the IIOP based protocol was it dropped. The Java documentation on garbage collection of remote objects still refer to the pioneering work done for Modula-3 Network Objects.Garbage Collection of Remote Objects, Java Remote Method Invocation Documentation for Java SE 8. Python's implementation of classes was also inspired by the class mechanism found in C++ and Modula-3.Classes, Official Python Documentation.

Preparation Full-service restaurants, ice cream shops, soda fountains, and diners usually prepare the shake in a specialized mixer known as a milkshake machine. At home, a blender is more commonly used. Milkshakes may be made from any flavor of ice cream; additional flavorings, such as chocolate syrup, malt syrup, or malted milk powder, are often added prior to mixing. Many fast food outlets do not make shakes from the individual ingredients; rather, they use automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a pre-made milkshake mixture consisting of milk, a sweetened flavoring agent, and a thickening agent. These are similar to soft-serve ice cream machines, but keep the shake at a drinkable consistency. Terminology Terminology around the distinction between a milkshake that uses ice cream and other forms of flavored milk varies regionally. An ice cream-based milkshake may be called a thick shake to distinguish it. In parts of New England and eastern Canada, the name frappe ( ) is used.milk shake.

Before the widespread availability of electric blenders, milkshake-type drinks were more like eggnog, or they were a hand- shaken mixture of crushed ice and milk, sugar, and flavorings.Vanilla Milk Shake Recipe from the \\"Second Edition of The Neighborhood Cookbook\\" published by the Council of Jewish Women, Portland, in 1914.

In 1922, Steven Poplawski invented the bottom-motor blender, which is sometimes used for making milkshakes.Poplawski, Stephen J. US Patent US1480914 ‚Äì Beverage mixer, Issued February 18, 1922 With the invention of the blender, milkshakes began to take their modern, whipped, aerated, and frothy form. The use of malted milk powder in milkshakes was popularized in the US by the Chicago drugstore chain Walgreens. Malted milk powder ‚Äî a mixture of evaporated milk, malted barley, and wheat flour ‚Äì had been invented by William Horlick in 1897 for use as an easily digested restorative health drink for disabled people and children, and as an infant's food. However, healthy people soon began drinking beverages made with malted milk simply for the taste, and malted milk beverages containing milk, chocolate syrup, and malt powder became a standard offering at soda fountains. In 1922, Walgreens employee Ivar \\"Pop\\" Coulson made a milkshake by adding two scoops of vanilla ice cream to the standard malted milk drink recipe. This item, under the name \\"Horlick's Malted Milk\\", was featured by the Walgreen drugstore chain as part of a chocolate milk shake, which itself became known as a \\"malted\\" or \\"malt\\" and became one of the most popular soda-fountain drinks.The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink, John F. Mariani [Lebhar- Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 196‚Äì197) The automation of milkshakes developed in the 1930s, after the invention of freon-cooled refrigerators provided a safe, reliable way of automatically making and dispensing ice cream. In 1936, inventor Earl Prince used the basic concept behind the freon-cooled automated ice cream machine to develop the Multimixer, a \\"five-spindled mixer that could produce five milkshakes at once, all automatically, and dispense them at the pull of a lever into awaiting paper cups.\\" In the late 1930s, several newspaper articles show that the term \\"frosted\\" was used to refer to milkshakes made with ice cream. In 1937, the Denton Journal in Maryland stated that \\"For a 'frosted' shake, add a dash of your favorite ice cream.\\" In 1939, the Mansfield News in Ohio stated that \\"A frosted beverage, in the vernacular, is something good to which ice cream has been added.

In Australia, milk bars had grown popular and milkshakes were normally served lightly whipped and often in the aluminium or stainless steel cups in which they were prepared. In addition to more conventional flavors, spearmint and lime flavored milkshakes became popular in Australia. =2000s‚Äìpresent= This milkshake was made using liquid nitrogen. Vapor can still be seen forming at the top. In 2006, the U.S. Agricultural Research Service developed reduced-sugar, low-fat milk shakes for lunch programs. The shakes have half the sugar and only 10% of the fat of commercial fast-food shakes. Schools need a milk shake machine or soft-serve ice cream machine to serve the milkshakes. The milkshakes also have added fiber and other nutrients, and they have much less lactose, which makes the shakes appropriate for some lactose-intolerant people.Konstance, Richard P.

By Bruce Horovitz, USA TODAY Muller stated that milkshakes are an \\"enormously profitable\\" item for restaurants, since the drinks contain so much air. The market research firm Technomic states that about 75% of the average-priced $3.38 restaurant shake in 2006 was profit. An executive from Sonic Drive-In, a U.S. chain of 1950s-style diner restaurants, calls shakes \\"one of our highest- volume, revenue-producing areas\\". A 2016 article stated that chefs are trying out innovative ideas with milkshakes to keep customers interested in the drinks. The article noted that coffee-flavored shakes are popular \\"because it complements both sweet and savory\\" dishes. Another trend is using different types of milk, such as almond milk, coconut milk, or hemp milk. Use in protests In May 2019, during the build-up to the EU parliament elections in the United Kingdom, the throwing of milkshakes emerged as a protest tactic, usually targeting right-wing politicians. The movement originated with the \\"milkshaking\\" of Tommy Robinson, with a second thrown later that month. The UK police requested that an Edinburgh McDonald's refrain from selling milkshakes on May 17 during a visit by Nigel Farage. This prompted Burger King to tweet in response: \\"We're selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun.\\" Burger King's tweet was later banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, because they felt that it \\"condoned the previous anti-social behaviour and encouraged further instances\\", and that it was therefore an \\"irresponsible\\" advertisement. At a separate visit in Newcastle on May 20, Farage had a Five Guys milkshake thrown at him. Carl Benjamin had a total of four milkshakes thrown at him that week. The act of milkshaking is similar to that of egging as a form of protest against political figures. In popular culture Milkshakes in the movies have been described a \\"shorthand for sweetness and goodness\\". In All About Eve, by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Bette Davis‚Äô character is unhappy to see a man she likes chatting up her young female assistant, so Davis' character orders an alcoholic Martini, and \\"then mockingly suggests [that] Eve [the young assistant] will have a milkshake\\", thereby \\"asserting womanhood over girlhood through milkshake's associations with virginity.\\" Similarly, the socially awkward and nerdy character Steve Buscemi plays in Ghost World is made fun of by a teenage girl because he orders a \\"virginal vanilla milkshake\\"; in Manhattan, by director Woody Allen, the director draws attention to the difference in age between his 42-year-old character (he also acts in the lead role) and his teenage girlfriend by having her drink a milkshake. In the film Lolita in 1997, a teenage girl drinks a milkshake while she is with the middle-aged man (her mother's new boyfriend) who is attracted to her. Pulp Fiction has a scene in a retro-50s diner where two characters on a first date discuss the merits of a \\"Five Dollar Milkshake\\" (\\"Martin and Lewis\\" for vanilla, \\"Amos 'n' Andy\\" for chocolate). The characters from Archie Comics are often depicted drinking milkshakes. The TV series Riverdale, inspired by the comics, depicts the characters in a 1950s-inspired local diner, Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe; to promote the show, the cast shared a milkshake during an appearance on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon. Master Shake, one of the main characters from the American animated series Aqua Teen Hunger Force (also known by various alternative titles), is a life-sized anthropomorphic milkshake. The term \\"milkshake duck\\" refers to the social media trend where \\"the internet rushes en masse to embrace something or someone as cute, worthy, fun or funny\\" (such as a duck that drinks milkshakes), but \\"then just as quickly drops it, when it‚Äôs revealed to somehow be unpleasantly complicated\\"; the paper called the term \\"useful shorthand\\" for when a \\"favourite [concept] is revealed to be problematic\\".

Introduced in 1912, Oreo is the best selling cookie brand in the United States. As of 2018, the version sold in the U.S. is made by the Nabisco division of Mondelez International. Oreo cookies are available in over one hundred countries. Many varieties of Oreo cookies have been produced, and limited-edition runs have become popular in the 21st century.  Etymology  The origin of the name \\"Oreo\\" is unknown, but there are many hypotheses, including derivations from the French word or, meaning 'gold', or from an Ancient Greek root meaning 'mountain'. Others believe that the cookie was named Oreo simply because the name was short and easy to pronounce. Another theory, proposed by food writer Stella Parks, is that the name derives from the Latin Oreodaphne, a genus of the laurel family. She observes that the original design of the Oreo includes a laurel wreath; and the names of several of Nabisco's cookies at the time of the original Oreo had botanical derivations, including Avena, Lotus, and Helicon (from Heliconia).  History  Representation of the trademarked pattern embossed onto the face of an Oreo cookie = Twentieth century = The \\"Oreo Biscuit\\" was first developed and produced by the National Biscuit Company (today known as Nabisco) in 1912 at its Chelsea, New York City factory in the current-day Chelsea Market complex, located on Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. Today, this same block of Ninth Avenue is known as \\"Oreo Way\\". The name Oreo was trademarked on March 14, 1912. It was launched as an imitation of the Hydrox cookie manufactured by Sunshine company, which was introduced in 1908. The original design on the face of the Oreo featured a wreath around the edge of the cookie and the name \\"OREO\\" in the center. In the United States, they were sold for 25 cents a pound (454 g) in novelty metal canisters with clear glass tops. The first Oreo was sold on March 6, 1912, to a grocer in Hoboken, New Jersey. The Oreo Biscuit was renamed in 1921 to \\"Oreo Sandwich\\"; in 1948, the name was changed to \\"Oreo Cr√®me Sandwich\\"; and in 1974 it became the \\"Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookie\\", the name that has remained to this day. A new design for the face of the cookie was launched in 1924; the modern-day Oreo design was developed in 1952 by William A. Turnier, incorporating the Nabisco logo. In 1920, a second lemon cr√®me-filled variety of the Oreo was introduced, as an alternative to the white cr√®me-filled variety, but this was discontinued in 1924 and the original flavor was the only version available for the next several decades. The modern Oreo cookie filling was developed by Nabisco's principal food scientist, Sam Porcello, who retired from Nabisco in 1993. Porcello held five patents directly related to his work on the Oreo; he also created a range of Oreo cookies that were covered in dark chocolate and white chocolate. In the early 1990s, health concerns prompted Nabisco to replace the lard in the cr√®me filling with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Oreo cookies are popular with people that have certain dietary restrictions, such as vegans, as the cr√®me filling does not use any animal products. However, there is still a risk of cross-contamination from other dairy-containing products made in the same production areas. = Twenty-first century = In January 2006, Nabisco replaced the trans fat in the Oreo cookie with non- hydrogenated vegetable oil. Nabisco began a marketing campaign in 2008, advertising the use of Oreo cookies in an online game called DSRL (which stands for \\"Double Stuf Racing League\\"), introduced the week before Super Bowl XLII. DSRL had been endorsed by football brothers Peyton Manning and Eli Manning; the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, also joined, challenging the Mannings to a race that was aired in an advertisement on January 18, 2009. Another campaign was launched for Golden Double Stuf Oreo cookies, in which the Manning brothers were challenged by Donald Trump and a character called \\"Double Trump\\", played by Darrell Hammond; this competition aired on January 24, 2010. The Mannings won both races. Another advertisement featured a \\"Hooded Menace\\" threatening to take over the DSRL, with Eli Manning and Stufy (the DSRL mascot) needing some help, which aired on September 14, 2010. Six days later, it was announced that Shaquille O'Neal and Apolo Ohno had joined Oreo's DSRL veterans Eli Manning and Venus Williams. The 2012 rainbow Oreo advertisement supporting Pride month In April 2011, Oreo announced its special edition Oreo cookies with blue cr√®me to promote the 2011 3D computer-animated movie Rio. The promotion included stickers inside each package of cookies. Two contests were also announced: by completing an album of stickers, consumers could win three movie passes and medium snack bar combos; and prize stickers could be found in winning packages, including a trip to Rio de Janeiro, backpacks, cinema passes for a year, and 3D glasses. The promotion was available in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia, and ended on May 30, 2011. In June 2012, Oreo posted an advertisement displaying an Oreo cookie with rainbow colored cr√®me to celebrate LGBT Pride month; the cookie itself was fictional and was not being manufactured or made available for sale. The advertisement prompted some negative comments, but Kraft stood by their promotion, stating that \\"Kraft Foods has a proud history of celebrating diversity and inclusiveness. We feel the Oreo ad is a fun reflection of our values.\\" This was followed during 2012 by a series of adverts commemorating other holidays and events, including a blue, white, and red cr√®me Oreo to honor Bastille Day, a stream of cookie crumbs marking the appearance of the Delta Aquariids meteor shower, and a cookie with a jagged bite taken out of it to promote Shark Week on The Discovery Channel.  International distribution  Oreo cookies are distributed worldwide through a variety of sales and marketing channels. As their popularity continues to grow, so too does the amount of distribution that comes with it. According to the Kraft Foods company, the Oreo is the \\"World's Best Selling Cookie\\". In March 2012, Time magazine reported that Oreo cookies were available in more than 100 different countries. Overall, it is estimated that since the Oreo cookie's inception in 1912, over 450 billion Oreos have been produced worldwide. Oreo biscuits (as they are known in the United Kingdom) were first introduced into Britain through the supermarket chain Sainsbury's. For several years, this was the only store in the UK to stock the Oreo ‚Äì until May 2008, when Kraft decided to fully launch the Oreo across the whole of the UK. It was repackaged in the more familiar British tube design, accompanied by a ¬£4.5M television advertising campaign based around the \\"twist, lick, dunk\\" catchphrase. In the UK, Kraft partnered with McDonald's to introduce the Oreo McFlurry (which was already on sale in several other countries) into a number of McDonald's locations during its annual Great Tastes of America promotions; in October 2015, the Oreo McFlurry became a permanent menu item at McDonald's in the UK. An Oreo flavored \\"Krushem\\" drink was also on sale in KFC stores across Britain. The ingredients of the British Oreo biscuit (as listed on the UK Oreo website) are slightly different from those of the US Oreo cookie. Unlike the US version, the British Oreo originally contained whey powder, which was not suitable for people with lactose intolerance. Additionally, as the whey powder was sourced from cheese made with calf rennet, the British version was also unsuitable for vegetarians. On December 6, 2011, Kraft announced that production of Oreo biscuits was to start in the UK ‚Äì their Cadbury factory in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was selected to manufacture Oreo biscuits in Britain for the first time and production began there in May 2013. Oreo cookies were introduced onto the Indian market by Cadbury India in 2011. The biscuit industry in India is estimated to be worth around 1.8 billion dollars. In Pakistan, Oreo is manufactured and sold by Lef√®vre-Utile, also known as LU.  Production  According to a statement from Kim McMiller, an Associate Director of Consumer Relations, a two-stage process is used to produce Oreo cookies. The base cake dough is formed into the familiar round cookies by a rotary mold at the entrance of a oven. Most of the Oreo production was once carried out at the Hershey's factory in Hershey, Pennsylvania. By 2017, more than 40 billion Oreo cookies were being produced annually in 18 different countries around the world. Oreo cookies for the Asian markets are manufactured in India, Indonesia, and China, with the exception of the Japanese market where they are manufactured locally under the brand \\"Yamazaki-Nabisco\\". Oreo cookies for the European market are made in Spain; they are made in Russia (Mondelƒìz Rus) for consumers in several CIS countries; and those sold in Australia are manufactured in Indonesia (previously China) or Spain, depending on the flavor. The version produced in Canada (sold under the Christie's brand) includes coconut oil and is sold exclusively in that region. Manufacture of Oreo biscuits began in Pakistan in early 2014, in collaboration with Mondelƒìz International of the United States and Continental Biscuits Limited (CBL) of Pakistan, at the CBL production plant in Sukkur. = Oreo boycott = In 2015, Mondelƒìz announced its decision to close some of its American factories and move production to Mexico, prompting the Oreo boycott. In 2016, after production had started in Mexico, the AFL-CIO encouraged the boycott and published consumer guidance to help identify which Mondelƒìz products were made in Mexico. In July 2016, Oreo cookies ceased production in Chicago.  Ingredients  The ingredients of Oreo cookies have remained largely unchanged from the original, although numerous alternative varieties and flavors have emerged over time. The classic Oreo cookie is made using eleven main ingredients: # Sugar # Unbleached enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamine mono-nitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid) # High oleic canola oil or palm oil # Cocoa (treated with alkali) # High- fructose corn syrup # Leavening agent (baking soda or monocalcium phosphate) # Corn starch # Salt # Soy lecithin # Vanillin # Chocolate = Nutrition = One six-pack of Oreos contains 270 calories, hence there are 45 calories in one cookie. Of these 45 calories, 27 come from carbohydrates, 16.5 come from fat, and 1.5 calories are provided by protein. Different Oreo flavors have varying amounts of carbohydrate: the chocolate fudge Oreo contains 13g of total carbohydrates (4% of the recommended daily intake) and 9g of sugars per serving of 3 cookies, while mint Oreos contain 25g of total carbohydrates and 18g of sugars per serving. Oreos contain small amounts of proteins and minerals (iron and sodium are present) but they do not contain any vitamins.  Varieties  Double Stuf Oreos In addition to their traditional design of two chocolate wafers separated by a cr√®me filling, Oreo cookies have been produced in a multitude of different varieties since they were first introduced. This list is only a guide to some of the more notable and popular types; not all are available in every country. The main varieties in the United States are: * Double Stuf Oreo ‚Äì Introduced in 1974, this variety has about double the normal amount of cr√®me filling as the original. After testing whether Double Stuf Oreos really had double the amount of cream, a math teacher found that Doubled Stuf Oreos only had 1.86 times the amount of cream of normal Oreos. Available with various different flavors of cr√®me filling: original, chocolate, peanut butter, cool mint, and birthday cake. In the UK these are called Double Creme Oreos and are only available in original flavor. The Golden Double Stuf Oreo, featuring golden Oreo wafers with a double portion of original vanilla flavored cr√®me, was introduced in 2009. * Football Oreo ‚Äì (American/Canadian) football-shaped Oreo cookies, introduced in 1976. * Big Stuf Oreo ‚Äì A short-lived variety of the Oreo cookie, introduced in 1987 but discontinued in 1991, these were several times the size of a normal Oreo. Sold individually, each Big Stuf contained and 13 grams of fat. * Golden Oreo ‚Äì First released in 2004, this has \\"golden\\" vanilla flavored wafers on the outside of the cookie, as an alternative to the original chocolate flavored wafers. Available with various flavors of cr√®me filling including original, chocolate, lemon and birthday cake. The chocolate cr√®me variety, being the reverse of the original cookie, was known as the Uh-Oh Oreo until 2007. Oreo Minis *Oreo Mini ‚Äì First introduced in 1991, these are miniature bite-sized versions of the original Oreo cookie. After being discontinued in the late 1990s, they were re-released in 2000 along with the redesigned 2001 Dodge Caravan minivan as part of a promotional tie-in with Daimler AG. Their packaging in the 1990s consisted of a \\"miniaturized\\" version of the full-sized cardboard tray and box used in Oreo packaging at the time. Their revised packaging consists of an aluminum foil bag. Oreo Minis are available with various flavors of cr√®me filling including original, chocolate, strawberry, and the new mint flavor which debuted in 2015. As well as the bagged version, they are also sold in Nabisco To-Go Cups, lidded plastic cups which fit into car cup-holders (in line with other Nabisco snacks that come in miniature form, such as Nutter Butters). A Golden Oreo Mini was also made available after the Golden Oreo was released in 2004. According to the Oreo website, the slogan of the Oreo Mini is \\"Grab 'em. Pop 'em. Love 'em.\\" * Mega Stuf Oreo ‚Äì Released in February 2013, the Mega Stuf variety is similar to Double Stuf, but with even more white cr√®me filling. They come in both chocolate and golden wafer varieties. * Oreo Thins ‚Äì Introduced in July 2015, this is a thin version of the original Oreo cookie. Thins come in both chocolate and golden wafer varieties, with various cr√®me filling flavors including chocolate, mint, lemon and tiramisu. Each cookie contains only 40 calories; they are 66% thinner than the original version. * Chocolate Oreo ‚Äì Simply an Oreo cookie with chocolate cr√®me filling instead of the original vanilla flavored white cr√®me filling. * Mint Oreo ‚Äì A variety of Oreo with two chocolate wafers separated by a mint flavored cr√®me filling. * The Most Stuf ‚Äì Introduced in January 2019, a limited edition Oreo with approximately four times the amount of cr√®me filling of a standard Oreo. Special edition Double Stuf Oreo cookies are produced during springtime, and around Halloween and Christmas. These have colored frosting reflecting the current holiday: blue or yellow for springtime; orange for Halloween; and red or green for the Christmas holiday. One side of each seasonal cookie is stamped with an appropriate design; the spring cookies feature flowers, butterflies, etc., while the Halloween editions feature a jack o'lantern, ghost, cat, flock of bats, and broom-riding witch. The 2017 Halloween Oreo broke with this tradition, having orange- colored cr√®me filling (albeit with classic vanilla flavor) but carrying no seasonal designs. In some countries, Oreos come in a variety of flavors that are not familiar to the U.S. market. For example, Green Tea Oreos are only available in China and Japan, while Lemon Ice Oreos were only ever introduced in Japan. Additionally, there are alfajor Oreo cookies available in Argentina, composed of three Oreo cookies with vanilla filling between each, and covered in chocolate. = Limited editions = Close-up view of a golden Oreo cookie wafer Beginning in the early 2010s, Nabisco began releasing limited edition runs of cookies with more exotic flavors. These \\"limited editions\\" typically appear in stores for a short period and are then discontinued, although some varieties have since resurfaced, for example: Reese's Oreos returned for a second limited run after they were first introduced for a limited period in 2014; and Birthday Cake Oreos, originally introduced in 2012, have since become permanently available. Some limited editions are only made available at certain retailers. Limited edition runs usually feature a cr√®me filling that has been flavored to replicate the taste of a specific fruit or dessert, from familiar flavors such as lemon or mint, to the more specific and unusual flavors of blueberry pie or red velvet cake. They may also incorporate different varieties of cookie wafer, for example Cinnamon-Bun Oreos featured cinnamon flavored cookies and \\"frosting flavored cr√®me\\". In recent years, some limited editions have paired Oreos with other recognizable confectionery brands, including Reese's, Swedish Fish, and Peeps. Some examples of limited edition Oreos are: * Birthday Cake Oreo ‚Äì A limited edition, available from February to July 2012, to celebrate Oreo's 100th birthday. Made up of two chocolate Oreo cookies with a birthday cake flavored cr√®me filling and sprinkles inside. On one of the two cookies, the traditional design was replaced with a birthday candle and the words \\"OREO 100\\". The birthday cake flavor has since been reintroduced, with a \\"double stuf\\" amount of cr√®me filling, in both chocolate and golden Oreo varieties, except that the cookies no longer display the \\"OREO 100\\" print. * Lemon Twist Oreo ‚Äì First released in 2012 as a limited edition, reintroduced in 2013, made up of two golden Oreo cookies with a lemon flavored cr√®me filling. * Neapolitan Oreo ‚Äì Released for a limited time in 2012, consisting of three golden Oreo cookies with a double sandwich of chocolate and strawberry cr√®me fillings.

This version was designed to emulate the popular red velvet cake. * Key Lime Pie Oreo ‚Äì A limited edition released in July 2015, made of two graham flavored Oreo cookies filled with key lime flavored cr√®me filling. * Cinnamon Bun Oreo ‚Äì Released in January 2016 as a limited edition, made up of two cinnamon flavored cookies filled with frosting flavored cr√®me filling. This version was designed to emulate the cinnamon bun. * S'mores Oreo ‚Äì Inspired by the traditional campfire snack and released as a limited edition in summer 2016, this version was made with graham flavored cookies and a double layer of cr√®me filling, one layer chocolate flavored and one layer marshmallow flavored. * Fruity Crisp Oreo ‚Äì A limited edition released in June 2016, consisting of two golden Oreo cookies with a fruity and colorful rice crisp cr√®me filling, similar to Fruity Pebbles. * Blueberry Pie Oreo ‚Äì Also released in June 2016 as a limited edition, and then reintroduced in 2017, made with graham flavored cookie wafers and a blueberry flavored cr√®me filling. * Swedish Fish Oreo ‚Äì Released as a limited edition in August 2016, made up of two chocolate Oreo cookies with a red cr√®me filling, flavored to resemble the red-colored Swedish Fish candy.

Naming controversy Oreo cookies, due to their almost-black cookies and white filling, have often been used in popular culture as a metaphor for relations between people of color and white people. In the 1976 movie A Star Is Born, Barbra Streisand's character Esther Hoffman is the white central member of The Oreos, a three-girl singing group, between black actresses Venetta Fields and Clydie King. The term \\"Oreo\\" has also been used as a disparaging and offensive racial slur to a person of mixed-race or African American heritage who are accused of trying to act white. The insult may be levied as an accusation that the person perpetuates the \\"un-level playing field for blacks\\", and is based on the implication that the person is like the cookie, \\"black on the outside and white on the inside\\". The 1974 novel Oreo, for example, was about a protagonist nicknamed Oreo due to her mixed Jewish- American and African-American heritage. Political pundits and television personalities such as John McLaughlin and Rush Limbaugh have also compared former American president Barack Obama to an Oreo due to his bi-racial heritage.

Obsolescence frequently occurs because a replacement has become available that has, in sum, more advantages compared to the disadvantages incurred by maintaining or repairing the original. Obsolete also refers to something that is already disused or discarded, or antiquated.Fowler HW and Fowler FG (1st ed.), Thompson Delia (ed.) (1995). The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, 9th Ed., Clarendon Press, Oxford. . Typically, obsolescence is preceded by a gradual decline in popularity. Consequences Driven by rapid technological changes, new components are developed and launched on the market with increasing speed. The result is a dramatic change in production methods of all components and their market availability. A growing industry sector is facing issues where life cycles of products no longer fit together with life cycles of required components. This issue is known as obsolescence, the status given to a part when it is no longer available from its original manufacturer. The problem of obsolescence is most prevalent for electronics technology, wherein the procurement lifetimes for microelectronic parts are often significantly shorter than the manufacturing and support life cycles for the products that use the parts. However, obsolescence extends beyond electronic components to other items, such as materials, textiles, and mechanical parts. In addition, obsolescence has been shown to appear for software, specifications, standards, processes, and soft resources, such as human skills. It is highly important to implement and operate an active management of obsolescence to mitigate and avoid extreme costs.Bjoern Bartels, Ulrich Ermel, Peter Sandborn and Michael G. Pecht (2012). Strategies to the Prediction, Mitigation and Management of Product Obsolescence, 1st. Ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey. . Types =Technical obsolescence= Technical obsolescence usually occurs when a new product or technology supersedes the old one, and it is preferred to use the new technology instead. Historical examples of new technologies superseding old ones include bronze replacing flint in hand-tools, DVDs replacing videocassettes, and the telephone replacing the telegraph. On a smaller scale, a particular product may become obsolete when a newer version replaces it. Many products in the computer industry become obsolete in this manner. For example, central processing units (CPUs) frequently become obsolete in favor of newer, faster units. Singularly, rapid obsolescence of data formats along with their supporting hardware and software can lead to loss of critical information, a process known as digital obsolescence. In many cases, a new technology does not totally replace the old technology because the old technology is still useful in certain applications. For example, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in TV and radio receivers in the 1960s, but vacuum tubes were still used for powerful transmitters because transistors for these power levels were not available. Even today, one has to use multiple transistors for a purpose that used to require just one tube. Products may also become obsolete when supporting technologies are no longer available to produce or even repair a product. For example, many integrated circuits, including CPUs, memory and even some relatively simple logic chips may no longer be produced because the technology has been superseded, their original developer has gone out of business or a competitor has bought them out and effectively killed off their products to remove competition. It is rarely worth redeveloping a product to get around these issues since its overall functionality and price/performance ratio has usually been superseded by that time as well. Some products become technologically obsolete due to changes in complementary products which results in the function of the first product being made unnecessary. For example, buggy whips became obsolete when people started to travel in cars rather than in horse-drawn buggies. = Functional obsolescence = Items become functionally obsolete when they can no longer adequately perform the function for which they were created. For example, while one could theoretically adapt an Avro Lancaster to deploy modern JDAM bombs, the situations in which it could actually succeed at doing so against modern air defenses would be so few that it would be essentially useless. Manufacturers and repair companies will typically cease support for products once they become obsolete as keeping production lines in place and parts in storage for a shrinking user base becomes unprofitable. This causes scarcity of spare parts and skilled technicians for repairs and thus escalates maintenance costs for obsolete products. This ultimately leads to prohibitive expense in keeping old technology functioning. = Architectural obsolescence = The term \\"obsolescence\\" was first applied to the built environment in 1910 in an attempt to explain American skyscrapers' sudden loss of value. New York engineer Reginald P. Bolton attributed this phenomenon to \\"something new and better out-competing the old\\" and calculated the average architectural lifespan of varying building types in order to formulate a rough estimate for their impending obsolescence. For example, he suggested that hotel's obsolescence will occur faster than banks due to their ever-changing functions and tastes. =Planned obsolescence= Sometimes marketers deliberately introduce obsolescence into their product strategy, with the objective of generating long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases. One example might be producing an appliance which is deliberately designed to wear out within five years of its purchase, pushing consumers to replace it within five years. =Style obsolescence= Jimi Hendrix's bell- bottoms When a product is no longer desirable because it has gone out of the popular fashion, its style is obsolete. One example is flared leg jeans; although this article of clothing may still be perfectly functional, it is no longer desirable because style trends have moved away from the flared leg cut. Because of the \\"fashion cycle\\", stylistically obsolete products may eventually regain popularity and cease to be obsolete. An example is \\"acid-wash\\" jeans, which were popular in the 1980s, became stylistically obsolete in the mid to late 1990s, and returned to popularity in the 2000s. =Obsolescence management= Obsolescence management, also referred to as \\"Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages\\" (DMSMS), is defined as to the activities that are undertaken to mitigate the effects of obsolescence.

It is an extremely sensitive contact explosive: small quantities explode with a loud, sharp snap when touched even lightly, releasing a purple cloud of iodine vapor; it can even be detonated by alpha radiation. NI3 has a complex structural chemistry that is difficult to study because of the instability of the derivatives. Structure of NI3 and its derivatives Nitrogen triiodide was first characterized by Raman spectroscopy in 1990 when it was prepared by an ammonia-free route. Boron nitride reacts with iodine monofluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at ‚àí30 ¬∞C to produce pure NI3 in low yield: :BN + 3 IF ‚Üí NI3 \\\\+ BF3 NI3 is pyramidal (C3v molecular symmetry), as are the other nitrogen trihalides and ammonia. The material that is usually called \\"nitrogen triiodide\\" is prepared by the reaction of iodine with ammonia. When this reaction is conducted at low temperatures in anhydrous ammonia, the initial product is NI3 ¬∑ (NH3)5, but this material loses some ammonia upon warming to give the 1:1 adduct NI3 ¬∑ NH3. This adduct was first reported by Bernard Courtois in 1812, and its formula was finally determined in 1905 by Oswald Silberrad. Its solid state structure consists of chains of -NI2-I-NI2-I-NI2-I-... Ammonia molecules are situated between the chains. When kept cold in the dark and damp with ammonia, NI3 ¬∑ NH3 is stable. Decomposition and explosiveness Detonation of 15g of nitrogen triiodide The instability of NI3 and NI3 ¬∑ NH3 can be attributed to the large steric strain caused by the three large iodine atoms being held in proximity to each other around the relatively tiny nitrogen atom. This results in a very low activation energy for its decomposition, a reaction made even more favorable due to the great stability of N2. Nitrogen triiodide has no practical commercial value due to its extreme shock sensitivity, making it impossible to store, transport, and utilize for controlled explosions. Whereas pure nitroglycerin is also greatly shock-sensitive (although not nearly as much so as nitrogen triiodide, which can be set off with the touch of a feather) and powerful, it was only due to phlegmatizers that its shock sensitivity was reduced and it became safer to handle and transport in the form of dynamite. The decomposition of NI3 proceeds as follows to give nitrogen gas and iodine: :2 NI3 (s) ‚Üí N2 (g) + 3 I2 (g) (‚àí290 kJ/mol) However, the dry material is a contact explosive, decomposing approximately as follows: : 8 NI3 ¬∑ NH3 ‚Üí 5 N2 \\\\+ 6 NH4I + 9 I2 Consistent with this equation, these explosions leave orange- to-purple stains of iodine, which can be removed with sodium thiosulfate solution. An alternate method of stain removal is to simply allow the iodine time to sublime. Small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesized as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of \\"chemical magic\\". To highlight the sensitivity of the compound, it is usually detonated by touching it with a feather but even the slightest air current, laser light, or other movement can cause detonation. Nitrogen triiodide is also notable for being the only known chemical explosive that detonates when exposed to alpha particles and nuclear fission products.

The CBC indicates the amounts of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, the concentration of hemoglobin, and the hematocrit (the volume percentage of red blood cells). The red blood cell indices, which indicate the average size and hemoglobin content of red blood cells, are also reported, and a white blood cell differential, which counts the different types of white blood cells, may be included. The CBC is often carried out as part of a medical assessment, and can be used to monitor health or diagnose diseases. The results are interpreted by comparing them to reference ranges, which vary with gender and age. Conditions like anemia and thrombocytopenia are defined by abnormal complete blood count results. The red blood cell indices can provide information about the cause of a person's anemia such as iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency, and the results of the white blood cell differential can help to diagnose viral, bacterial and parasitic infections and blood disorders like leukemia. Not all results falling outside of the reference range require medical intervention. The CBC is performed using basic laboratory equipment or an automated hematology analyzer, which counts red and white blood cells and platelets and collects information on their size and structure. The concentration of hemoglobin is measured, and the red blood cell indices are calculated from measurements of red blood cells and hemoglobin. Manual tests can be used to independently confirm abnormal results. Approximately 10‚Äì25% of samples require a manual blood smear review, in which the blood is stained and viewed under a microscope to verify that the analyzer results are consistent with the appearance of the cells and to look for abnormalities. The hematocrit can be determined manually by centrifuging the sample and measuring the proportion of red blood cells, and in laboratories without access to automated instruments, blood cells are counted under the microscope using a hemocytometer. In 1852, Karl Vierordt published the first procedure for performing a blood count, which involved spreading a known volume of blood on a microscope slide and counting every cell. The invention of the hemocytometer in 1874 by Louis-Charles Malassez simplified the microscopic analysis of blood cells, and in the late 19th century, Paul Ehrlich and Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky developed techniques for staining white and red blood cells that are still used to examine blood smears. Automated methods for measuring hemoglobin were developed in the 1920s, and Maxwell Wintrobe introduced the Wintrobe hematocrit method in 1929, which in turn allowed him to define the red blood cell indices. A landmark in the automation of blood cell counts was the Coulter principle, which was patented by Wallace H. Coulter in 1953. The principle involves using electrical impedance measurements to count blood cells and measure their sizes, a technology that remains in use in many automated analyzers. Further research in the 1970s involved the use of optical measurements to count and identify cells, which enabled the automation of the white blood cell differential. Purpose cells and platelets in human blood. The red blood cells, which carry oxygen are predominant and give rise to the colour of blood. The white blood cells are part of the immune system. The platelets are needed to form clots, which prevent excessive bleeding.alt=See caption. Blood is composed of a fluid portion, called plasma, and a cellular portion that contains red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.Harmening, DM (2009). pp. 2‚Äì3. The complete blood count evaluates these three cellular components of blood. Some medical conditions, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, are defined by marked increases or decreases in blood cell counts. Changes in many organ systems may affect the blood, so CBC results are useful for investigating a wide range of conditions. Because of the amount of information it provides, the complete blood count is one of the most commonly performed medical laboratory tests.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 244.Marshall, WJ et al. (2014). p. 497. The CBC is often used to screen for diseases as part of a medical assessment.Van Leeuwen, AM; Bladh, ML (2019). p. 377. It is also called for when a healthcare provider suspects a person has a disease that affects blood cells, such as an infection, a bleeding disorder, or some cancers. People who have been diagnosed with disorders that may cause abnormal CBC results or who are receiving treatments that can affect blood cell counts may have a regular CBC performed to monitor their health, and the test is often performed each day on people who are hospitalized.Lewandrowski, K et al. (2016). p. 96. The results may indicate a need for a blood or platelet transfusion. The complete blood count has specific applications in many medical specialties. It is often performed before a person undergoes surgery to detect anemia, ensure that platelet levels are sufficient, and screen for infection,Hartman, CJ; Kavoussi, LR (2017). pp. 4‚Äì5. as well as after surgery, so that blood loss can be monitored. In emergency medicine, the CBC is used to investigate numerous symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath,Walls, R et al. (2017). p. 130.Walls, R et al. (2017). p. 219.Walls, R et al. (2017). p. 199. and to assess bleeding and trauma.Walls, R et al. (2017). p. 1464.Moore, EE et al. (2017). p. 162. Blood counts are closely monitored in people undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer, because these treatments suppress the production of blood cells in the bone marrow and can produce severely low levels of white blood cells, platelets and hemoglobin.Lewis, SL et al. (2015). p. 280. Regular CBCs are necessary for people taking some psychiatric drugs, such as clozapine and carbamazepine, which in rare cases can cause a life-threatening drop in the number of white blood cells (agranulocytosis).Fatemi, SH; Clayton, PJ. (2016). p. 666. Because anemia during pregnancy can result in poorer outcomes for the mother and her baby, the complete blood count is a routine part of prenatal care;Dooley, EK; Ringler, RL. (2012). pp. 20‚Äì1. and in newborn babies, a CBC may be needed to investigate jaundice or to count the number of immature cells in the white blood cell differential, which can be an indicator of sepsis.Keohane, E et al. (2015). pp. 834‚Äì5.Schafermeyer, RW et al. (2018). pp. 467‚Äì8. The complete blood count is an essential tool of hematology, which is the study of the cause, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to blood.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Introduction\\". The results of the CBC and smear examination reflect the functioning of the hematopoietic system‚Äîthe organs and tissues involved in the production and development of blood cells, particularly the bone marrow.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 244.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 11. For example, a low count of all three cell types (pancytopenia) can indicate that blood cell production is being affected by a marrow disorder, and a bone marrow examination can further investigate the cause.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 43. Abnormal cells on the blood smear might indicate acute leukemia or lymphoma, while an abnormally high count of neutrophils or lymphocytes, in combination with a person's symptoms and blood smear findings, may raise suspicion for a myeloproliferative disorder or lymphoproliferative disorder. Examination of the CBC results and the blood smear can help to distinguish between causes of anemia, such as nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow disorders, acquired hemolytic anemias and inherited conditions like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). pp. 42‚Äì4.McPherson, RA; Pincus, MR (2017). p. 574. The reference ranges for the complete blood count represent the range of results found in 95% of apparently healthy people. By definition, 5% of results will always fall outside this range, so some abnormal results may reflect natural variation rather than signifying a medical issue.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 213. This is particularly likely if such results are only slightly outside the reference range, if they are consistent with the person's previous results, or if there are no other related abnormalities on the CBC.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 245. When the test is performed on a relatively healthy population, the number of clinically insignificant abnormalities may exceed the number of results that represent disease.Lewandrowski, K et al. (2016). pp. 96‚Äì7. For this reason, professional organizations in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada recommend against pre-operative CBC testing for low-risk surgeries in individuals without relevant medical conditions.Lewandrowski, K et al. (2016). p. 97.Kirkham, KR et al. (2016). p. 805. Repeated blood draws for hematology testing in hospitalized patients can contribute to hospital-acquired anemia and may result in unnecessary transfusions.  Procedure  CBC performed by the fingerstick method, using an Abbott Cell-Dyn 1700 automated analyzer The sample is collected by drawing blood into a tube containing an anticoagulant‚Äîtypically EDTA‚Äîto stop its natural clotting.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Specimen collection\\". The blood is usually taken from a vein, but when this is difficult it may be collected from capillaries by a fingerstick, or by a heelprick in babies.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 28.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). p. 1. Testing is typically performed on an automated analyzer, but manual techniques such as a blood smear examination or manual hematocrit test can be used to investigate abnormal results.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Cell counts\\", \\"Volume of packed red cells (hematocrit)\\", \\"Leukocyte differentials\\". Cell counts and hemoglobin measurements are performed manually in laboratories lacking access to automated instruments.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 551‚Äì5. =Automated= On board the analyzer, the sample is agitated to evenly distribute the cells, then diluted and partitioned into at least two channels, one of which is used to count red blood cells and platelets, the other to count white blood cells and determine the hemoglobin concentration. Some instruments measure hemoglobin in a separate channel, and additional channels may be used for differential white blood cell counts, reticulocyte counts and specialized measurements of platelets.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 29.Dasgupta, A; Sepulveda, JL (2013). p. 305. The cells are suspended in a fluid stream and their properties are measured as they flow past sensors in a technique known as flow cytometry.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 12. Hydrodynamic focusing may be used to isolate individual cells so that more accurate results can be obtained: the diluted sample is injected into a stream of low-pressure fluid, which causes the cells in the sample to line up in single file through laminar flow.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 32‚Äì3.McPherson, RA; Pincus, MR (2017). p. 44. alt=CBC samples in a rack, waiting to be run on a bench-top analyzer alt=Schematic of the Coulter principle. A particle suspended in a conductive medium passes through an aperture, causing an increase in impedance To measure the hemoglobin concentration, a reagent chemical is added to the sample to destroy (lyse) the red cells in a channel separate from that used for red blood cell counts. On analyzers that perform white blood cell counts in the same channel as hemoglobin measurement, this permits white blood cells to be counted more easily.Bain, BJ (2015). pp. 29‚Äì30. Hematology analyzers measure hemoglobin using spectrophotometry and are based on the linear relationship between the absorbance of light and the amount of hemoglobin present. Chemicals are used to convert different forms of hemoglobin, such as oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin, to one stable form, usually cyanmethemoglobin, and to create a permanent colour change. The absorbance of the resulting colour, when measured at a specific wavelength‚Äîusually 540 nanometres‚Äîcorresponds with the concentration of hemoglobin.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Hemoglobin concentration\\". Sensors count and identify the cells in the sample using two main principles: electrical impedance and light scattering.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 208. Impedance-based cell counting operates on the Coulter principle: cells are suspended in a fluid carrying an electric current, and as they pass through an aperture, they cause decreases in current because of their poor electrical conductivity. The amplitude of the voltage pulse generated as a cell crosses the aperture correlates with the amount of fluid displaced by the cell, and thus the cell's volume,Bain, BJ (2015). pp. 30‚Äì1. while the total number of pulses correlates with the number of cells in the sample. The distribution of cell volumes is plotted on a histogram, and by setting volume thresholds based on the typical sizes of each type of cell, the different cell populations can be identified and counted.Keohane, E et al. (2015). pp. 208‚Äì9. In light scattering techniques, light from a laser or a tungsten-halogen lamp is directed at the stream of cells to collect information about their size and structure. Cells scatter light at different angles as they pass through the beam, which is detected using photometers. Forward scatter, which refers to the amount of light scattered along the beam's axis, is mainly caused by diffraction of light and correlates with cellular size, while side scatter (light scattered at a 90-degree angle) is caused by reflection and refraction and provides information about cellular complexity.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). p. 32.Keohane, E et al. (2015). pp. 210‚Äì1. Radiofrequency-based methods can be used in combination with impedance. These techniques work on the same principle of measuring the interruption in current as cells pass through an aperture, but since the high-frequency RF current penetrates into the cells, the amplitude of the resulting pulse relates to factors like the relative size of the nucleus, the nucleus's structure, and the amount of granules in the cytoplasm.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 210.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). p. 27. Small red cells and cellular debris, which are similar in size to platelets, may interfere with the platelet count, and large platelets may not be counted accurately, so some analyzers use additional techniques to measure platelets, such as fluorescent staining, multi-angle light scatter and monoclonal antibody tagging. Most analyzers directly measure the average size of red blood cells, which is called the mean cell volume (MCV), and calculate the hematocrit by multiplying the red blood cell count by the MCV. Some measure the hematocrit by comparing the total volume of red blood cells to the volume of blood sampled, and derive the MCV from the hematocrit and red blood cell count. The hemoglobin concentration, the red blood cell count and the hematocrit are used to calculate the average amount of hemoglobin within each red blood cell, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH); and its concentration, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Mean corpuscular volume\\"; \\"Mean corpuscular hemoglobin\\"; \\"Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration\\"; \\"Red cell distribution width\\". Another calculation, the red blood cell distribution width (RDW), is derived from the standard deviation of the mean cell volume and reflects variation in cellular size.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 2. alt=A scatter plot displaying many differently coloured clusters, labelled with the type of white blood cell they correspond to. After being treated with reagents, white blood cells form three distinct peaks when their volumes are plotted on a histogram. These peaks correspond to populations of granulocytes, mononuclear cells and lymphocytes, allowing a three-part differential to be performed based on cell volume alone.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 209.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). p. 37. More advanced analyzers use additional techniques to provide a five- to seven-part differential, such as light scattering or radiofrequency analysis, or using dyes to stain specific chemicals inside cells‚Äîfor example, nucleic acids, which are found in higher concentrations in immature cellsArneth, BM; Menschikowki, M. (2015). p. 3. or myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found in cells of the myeloid lineage.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Leukocyte differentials\\".Naeim, F et al. (2009). p. 210. Basophils may be counted in a separate channel where a reagent destroys other white cells and leaves basophils intact. The data collected from these measurements is analyzed and plotted on a scattergram, where it forms clusters that correlate with each white blood cell type. Another approach to automating the differential count is the use of digital microscopy software,Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 318. which uses artificial intelligence to classify white blood cells from photomicrographs of the blood smear. The cell images are displayed to a human operator, who can manually re-classify the cells if necessary.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). p. 39. Most analyzers take less than a minute to run all the tests in the complete blood count. Because analyzers sample and count many individual cells, the results are very precise.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Introduction\\"; \\"Cell counts\\". However, some abnormal cells may not be identified correctly, requiring manual review of the instrument's results and identification by other means of abnormal cells the instrument could not categorize.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Advantages and sources of error with automated hematology\\". Point-of-care testing Point-of-care testing refers to tests conducted outside of the laboratory setting, such as at a person's bedside or in a clinic. This method of testing is faster and uses less blood than conventional methods, and does not require specially trained personnel, so it is useful in emergency situations and in areas with limited access to resources. Commonly used devices for point-of-care hematology testing include the HemoCue, a portable analyzer that uses spectrophotometry to measure the hemoglobin concentration of the sample, and the i-STAT, which derives a hemoglobin reading by estimating the concentration of red blood cells from the conductivity of the blood. Hemoglobin and hematocrit can be measured on point-of-care devices designed for blood gas testing, but these measurements sometimes correlate poorly with those obtained through standard methods. There are simplified versions of hematology analyzers designed for use in clinics that can provide a complete blood count and differential.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). p. 43. =Manual= alt=Diagram of the manual hematocrit test showing the fraction of red blood cells measured as 0.46. The tests can be performed manually when automated equipment is not available or when the analyzer results indicate that further investigation is needed. Automated results are flagged for manual blood smear review in 10‚Äì25% of cases, which may be due to abnormal cell populations that the analyzer cannot properly count, internal flags generated by the analyzer that suggest the results could be inaccurate,Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 225. or numerical results that fall outside set thresholds. To investigate these issues, blood is spread on a microscope slide, stained with a Romanowsky stain, and examined under a microscope.Bain, BJ. (2015). pp. 9‚Äì11. The appearance of the red and white blood cells and platelets is assessed, and qualitative abnormalities are reported if present.Palmer, L et al. (2015). pp. 288‚Äì9. Changes in the appearance of red blood cells can have considerable diagnostic significance‚Äîfor example, the presence of sickle cells is indicative of sickle cell disease, and a high number of fragmented red blood cells (schistocytes) requires urgent investigation as it can suggest a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.Turgeon, ML (2016). pp. 325‚Äì6. In some inflammatory conditions and in paraprotein disorders like multiple myeloma, high levels of protein in the blood may cause red blood cells to appear stacked together on the smear, which is termed rouleaux.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 98. Some parasitic diseases, such as malaria and babesiosis, can be detected by finding the causative organisms on the blood smear,Bain, BJ (2015). p. 154. and the platelet count can be estimated from the blood smear, which is useful if the automated platelet results are inaccurate. To perform a manual white blood cell differential, the microscopist counts 100 cells on the blood smear and classifies them based on their appearance; sometimes 200 cells are counted.Wang, SA; Hasserjian, RP (2018). p. 10. This gives the percentage of each type of white blood cell, and by multiplying these percentages by the total number of white blood cells, the absolute number of each type of white cell can be obtained.Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 329. Manual counting is subject to sampling error because so few cells are counted compared with automated analysis, but it can identify abnormal cells that analyzers cannot, such as the blast cells seen in acute leukemia. Clinically significant features like toxic granulation and vacuolation can also be ascertained from microscopic examination of white blood cells.Palmer, L et al. (2015). pp. 296‚Äì7. The hematocrit can performed manually by filling a capillary tube with blood, centrifuging it, and measuring the percentage of the blood that consists of red blood cells. This is useful in some conditions that can cause automated hematocrit results to be incorrect, such as polycythemia (a highly elevated red blood cell count)Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Volume of packed red cells (hematocrit)\\". or severe leukocytosis (a highly elevated white blood cell count, which interferes with red blood cell measurements by causing white blood cells to be counted as red cells). Red and white blood cells and platelets can be counted using a hemocytometer, a microscope slide containing a chamber that holds a specified volume of diluted blood. The hemocytometer's chamber is etched with a calibrated grid to aid in cell counting, and the cells seen in the grid are counted and divided by the volume of blood examined, which is determined from the number of squares counted on the grid, to obtain the concentration of cells in the sample.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Cell counts\\". Manual cell counts are labour-intensive and inaccurate compared to automated methods, so they are rarely used except in laboratories that do not have access to automated analyzers. To count white blood cells, the sample is diluted using a fluid containing a compound that lyses red blood cells, such as ammonium oxalate, acetic acid, or hydrochloric acid.Keohane, E et al. (2017) p. 189. Sometimes a stain is added to the diluent that highlights the nuclei of white blood cells, making them easier to identify. Manual platelet counts are performed in a similar manner, although some methods leave the red blood cells intact. Using a phase-contrast microscope, rather than a light microscope, can make platelets easier to identify.Bain, BJ (2015). pp. 22‚Äì3. The manual red blood cell count is rarely performed, as it is inaccurate and other methods such as hemoglobinometry and the manual hematocrit are available for assessing red blood cells; but if it is necessary to do so, red blood cells can be counted in blood that has been diluted with saline.Keohane, E et al. (2017). pp. 190‚Äì1. Hemoglobin can be measured manually using a spectrophotometer or colorimeter. To measure hemoglobin manually, the sample is diluted using reagents that destroy red blood cells to release the hemoglobin. Other chemicals are used to convert different types of hemoglobin to one form, allowing it to be easily measured. The solution is then placed in a measuring cuvette and the absorbance is measured at a specific wavelength, which depends on the type of reagent used. A reference standard containing a known amount of hemoglobin is used to determine the relationship between the absorbance and the hemoglobin concentration, allowing the hemoglobin level of the sample to be measured.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 19‚Äì22. In rural and economically disadvantaged areas, available testing is limited by access to equipment and personnel. At primary care facilities in these regions, testing may be limited to examination of red cell morphology and manual measurement of hemoglobin, while more complex techniques like manual cell counts and differentials, and sometimes automated cell counts, are performed at district laboratories. Regional and provincial hospitals and academic centres typically have access to automated analyzers. Where laboratory facilities are not available, an estimate of hemoglobin concentration can be obtained by placing a drop of blood on a standardized type of absorbent paper and comparing it to a colour scale.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 548‚Äì52. =Quality control= Automated analyzers have to be regularly calibrated. Most manufacturers provide preserved blood with defined parameters and the analyzers are adjusted if the results are outside defined thresholds.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 46. To ensure that results continue to be accurate, quality control samples, which are typically provided by the instrument manufacturer, are tested at least once per day. The samples are formulated to provide specific results, and laboratories compare their results against the known values to ensure the instrument is functioning properly.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). pp. 697‚Äì8. For laboratories without access to commercial quality control material, an Indian regulatory organization recommends running patient samples in duplicate and comparing the results. A moving average measurement, in which the average results for patient samples are measured at intervals, can be used as an additional quality control technique. Assuming that the characteristics of the patient population remain roughly the same over time, the average should remain constant; large shifts in the average value can indicate instrument problems. The MCHC values are particularly useful in this regard.Greer, JP (2008). p. 4. In addition to analyzing internal quality control samples with known results, laboratories may receive external quality assessment samples from regulatory organizations. While the purpose of internal quality control is to ensure that analyzer results are reproducible within a given laboratory, external quality assessment verifies that results from different laboratories are consistent with each other and with the target values.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). p. 438. The expected results for external quality assessment samples are not disclosed to the laboratory.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 539‚Äì40. External quality assessment programs have been widely adopted in North America and western Europe, and laboratories are often required to participate in these programs to maintain accreditation. Logistical issues may make it difficult for laboratories in under-resourced areas to implement external quality assessment schemes.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). p. 551. Included tests The tests in the CBC measure the amounts of platelets and red and white blood cells, along with the hemoglobin and hematocrit values. Red blood cell indices‚ÄîMCV, MCH and MCHC‚Äîwhich describe the size of red blood cells and their hemoglobin content, are reported along with the red blood cell distribution width (RDW), which measures the amount of variation in the sizes of red blood cells. A white blood cell differential, which enumerates the different types of white blood cells, may be performed, and a count of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) is sometimes included.Keohane, E et al. (2015). pp. 4‚Äì5. =Red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit= { style=\\"text-align:left; width:100%; font-size:85%; border: 1px solid grey\\" + Complete blood count - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Analyte ! scope=\\"col\\"  Result ! scope=\\"col\\"  Normal range - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Red cell count  5.5 x 1012/L  4.5‚Äì5.7 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  White cell count  9.8 x 109/L  4.0‚Äì10.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hemoglobin   133‚Äì167 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hematocrit  0.42  0.35‚Äì0.53 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  MCV   77‚Äì98 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  MCH   26‚Äì33 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  MCHC   330‚Äì370 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  RDW  14.5%  10.3‚Äì15.3 } An example of CBC results showing a low hemoglobin, mean red cell volume (MCV), mean red cell hemoglobin (MCH) and mean red blood cell hemoglobin content (MCHC).

Red blood cells deliver oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and on their return carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs where it is exhaled. These functions are mediated by the cells' hemoglobin.Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 293. The analyzer counts red blood cells, reporting the result in units of 106 cells per microlitre of blood (√ó 106/ŒºL) or 1012 cells per litre (√ó 1012/L), and measures their average size, which is called the mean cell volume and expressed in femtolitres or cubic micrometres. By multiplying the mean cell volume by the red blood cell count, the hematocrit (HCT) or packed cell volume (PCV), a measurement of the percentage of blood that is made up of red blood cells, can be derived; and when the hematocrit is performed directly, the mean cell volume may be calculated from the hematocrit and red blood cell count.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 33‚Äì4.Turgeon, ML (2016). pp. 319‚Äì20. Hemoglobin, measured after the red blood cells are lysed, is reported in units of grams per litre (g/L) or grams per decilitre (g/dL). Assuming that the red blood cells are normal, there is a constant relationship between hemoglobin and hematocrit: the hematocrit percentage is approximately three times greater than the hemoglobin value in g/dL, plus or minus three. This relationship, called the rule of three, can be used to confirm that CBC results are correct.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 195. Two other measurements are calculated from the red blood cell count, the hemoglobin concentration, and the hematocrit: the mean corpuscular hemoglobin and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 22.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 196. These parameters describe the hemoglobin content of each red blood cell. The MCH and MCHC can be confusing; in essence the MCH is a measure of the average amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell. The MCHC gives the average proportion of the cell that is hemoglobin. The MCH does not take into account the size of the red blood cells whereas the MCHC does.Schmaier, AH; Lazarus, HM (2012). p. 25. Collectively, the MCV, MCH, and MCHC are referred to as the red blood cell indices. Changes in these indices are visible on the blood smear: red blood cells that are abnormally large or small can be identified by comparison to the sizes of white blood cells, and cells with a low hemoglobin concentration appear pale.Bain, BJ (2015). pp. 73‚Äì5. Another parameter is calculated from the initial measurements of red blood cells: the red blood cell distribution width or RDW, which reflects the degree of variation in the cells' size. alt=See caption. An abnormally low hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count indicates anemia.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 285. Anemia is not a diagnosis on its own, but it points to an underlying condition affecting the person's red blood cells.Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 329. General causes of anemia include blood loss, production of defective red blood cells (ineffective erythropoeisis), decreased production of red blood cells (insufficient erythropoeisis), and increased destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia).Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 286. Anemia reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen, causing symptoms like tiredness and shortness of breath.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 503. If the hemoglobin level falls below thresholds based on the person's clinical condition, a blood transfusion may be necessary.Vieth, JT; Lane, DR (2014). pp. 11‚Äì2. An increased number of red blood cells, which usually leads to an increase in the hemoglobin and hematocrit, is called polycythemia.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 232. Dehydration or use of diuretics can cause polycythemia by decreasing the amount of plasma compared to red cells. Polycythemia can also occur when the body produces more red blood cells to compensate for chronically low oxygen levels in conditions like lung or heart disease, or when a person has abnormally high levels of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells. In polycythemia vera, the bone marrow produces red cells and other blood cells at an excessively high rate.McPherson, RA; Pincus, MR (2017). pp. 600‚Äì1. Evaluation of red blood cell indices is helpful in determining the cause of anemia. If the MCV is low, the anemia is termed microcytic, while anemia with a high MCV is called macrocytic anemia. Anemia with a low MCHC is called hypochromic anemia. If anemia is present but the red blood cell indices are normal, the anemia is considered normochromic and normocytic. The term hyperchromia, referring to a high MCHC, is generally not used. Elevation of the MCHC above the upper reference value is rare, mainly occurring in conditions such as spherocytosis, sickle cell disease and hemoglobin C disease.Smock, KJ. Chapter 1 in Greer, JP et al, ed. (2018), sec. \\"Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration\\". An elevated MCHC can also be a false result from conditions like red blood cell agglutination (which causes a false decrease in the red blood cell count, elevating the MCHC)Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 197.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). p. 88. or highly elevated amounts of lipids in the blood (which causes a false increase in the hemoglobin result).Bain, BJ (2015). p. 193. Microcytic anemia is typically associated with iron deficiency, thalassemia, and anemia of chronic disease, while macrocytic anemia is associated with alcoholism, folate and B12 deficiency, use of some drugs, and some bone marrow diseases. Acute blood loss, hemolytic anemia, bone marrow disorders, and various chronic diseases can result in anemia with a normocytic blood picture.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 501‚Äì2. The MCV serves an additional purpose in laboratory quality control. It is relatively stable over time compared to other CBC parameters, so a large change in MCV may indicate that the sample was drawn from the wrong patient.Ciesla, B (2018). p. 26. A low RDW has no clinical significance, but an elevated RDW represents increased variation in red blood cell size, a condition known as anisocytosis. Anisocytosis is common in nutritional anemias such as iron deficiency anemia and anemia due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, while people with thalassemia may have a normal RDW. Based on the CBC results, further steps can be taken to investigate anemia, such as a ferritin test to confirm the presence of iron deficiency, or hemoglobin electrophoresis to diagnose a hemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia or sickle cell disease.Powell, DJ; Achebe, MO. (2016). pp. 530; 537‚Äì9. =White blood cells= { style=\\"border: 1px solid grey;\\" role=\\"presentation\\" + Sample CBC in chronic myeloid leukemia - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  { style=\\"text- align:left; width:12em; font-size:85%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Analyte ! scope=\\"col\\"  Result - ! scope=\\"row\\"  White cell count  x 109/L - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hemoglobin  116 g/L - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hematocrit  0.349 L/L - ! scope=\\"row\\"  MCV  89.0 fL - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Platelet count  x 109/L }  { style=\\"text-align:left; width:14em; font-size:85%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Analyte ! scope=\\"col\\"  Result - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Neutrophils  48% - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Lymphocytes  3% - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Monocytes  4% - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Eosinophils  3% - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Basophils  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Band neutrophils  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Metamyelocytes  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Myelocytes  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Blast cells  } } The white blood cell and platelet counts are markedly increased, and anemia is present. The differential count shows basophilia and the presence of band neutrophils, and immature granulocytes and blast cells.Harmening, DM (2009). p. 380. White blood cells defend against infections and are involved in the inflammatory response.Pagana, TJ et al. (2014). p. 992. A high white blood cell count, which is called leukocytosis, often occurs in infections, inflammation, and states of physiologic stress. It can also be caused by diseases that involve abnormal production of blood cells, such as myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders.Walls, R et al. (2017). p. 1480‚Äì1. A decreased white blood cell count, termed leukopenia, can lead to an increased risk of acquiring infections, and occurs in treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy and many conditions that inhibit the production of blood cells.Pagana, TJ et al. (2014). p. 991. Sepsis is associated with both leukocytosis and leukopenia.McCulloh, RJ; Opal, SM. Chapter 42 in Oropello, JM et al, ed. (2016), sec. \\"White blood cell count and differential\\". The total white blood cell count is usually reported in cells per microlitre of blood (/ŒºL) or 109 cells per litre (√ó 109/L). In the white blood cell differential, the different types of white blood cells are identified and counted. The results are reported as a percentage and as an absolute number per unit volume. Five types of white blood cells‚Äîneutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils‚Äîare typically measured. Some instruments report the number of immature granulocytes, which is a classification consisting of precursors of neutrophils; specifically, promyelocytes, myelocytes and metamyelocytes.Chabot-Richards, DS; George, TI (2015). p. 10. Other cell types are reported if they are identified in the manual differential.Palmer, L et al. (2015). p. 294. Differential results are useful in diagnosing and monitoring many medical conditions. For example, an elevated neutrophil count (neutrophilia) is associated with bacterial infection, inflammation, and myeloproliferative disorders,Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 306. while a decreased count (neutropenia) may occur in individuals who are undergoing chemotherapy or taking certain drugs, or who have diseases affecting the bone marrow.Hoffman, EJ et al. (2013). p. 644.Porwit, A et al. (2011). pp. 247‚Äì52. Neutropenia can also be caused by some congenital disorders and may occur transiently after viral or bacterial infections in children.Walls, R et al. (2017). p. 1483. People with severe neutropenia and clinical signs of infection are treated with antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening disease.Walls, R et al. (2017). pp. 1497‚Äì8. Blood film from a person with chronic myeloid leukemia: many immature and abnormal white blood cells are visible. An increased number of band neutrophils‚Äîyoung neutrophils that lack segmented nuclei‚Äîor immature granulocytes is termed left shift and occurs in sepsis and some blood disorders, but is normal in pregnancy.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 99.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). p. 85. An elevated lymphocyte count (lymphocytosis) is associated with viral infectionTurgeon, ML (2016). p. 309. and lymphoproliferative disorders like chronic lymphocytic leukemia;Bain, BJ et al. (2017). p. 498. elevated monocyte counts (monocytosis) are associated with chronic inflammatory states;Bain, BJ (2015). p. 243. and the eosinophil count is often increased (eosinophilia) in parasitic infections and allergic conditions.Porwit, A et al. (2011). p. 256. An increased number of basophils, termed basophilia, can occur in myeloproliferative disorders like chronic myeloid leukemia and polycythemia vera.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 44. The presence of some types of abnormal cells, such as blast cells or lymphocytes with neoplastic features, is suggestive of a hematologic malignancy.d'Onofrio, G; Zini, G. (2014). p. 289.Palmer, L et al. (2015). p. 298. =Platelets= Blood film of essential thrombocythemia. Platelets are visible as small purple structures. Platelets play an essential role in clotting. When the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, platelets adhere to the exposed surface at the site of injury and plug the gap. Simultaneous activation of the coagulation cascade results in the formation of fibrin, which reinforces the platelet plug to create a stable clot.Turgeon, ML (2016). pp. 358‚Äì60. A low platelet count, known as thrombocytopenia, may cause bleeding if severe.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 1993. It can occur in individuals who are undergoing treatments that suppress the bone marrow, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or taking certain drugs, such as heparin, that can induce the immune system to destroy platelets. Thrombocytopenia is a feature of many blood disorders, like acute leukemia and aplastic anemia, as well as some autoimmune diseases.Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 315.Walls, R et al. (2017). pp. 1486‚Äì8. If the platelet count is extremely low, a platelet transfusion may be performed. Thrombocytosis, meaning a high platelet count, may occur in states of inflammation or trauma,Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 4. as well as in iron deficiency,Walls, R et al. (2017). p. 1489. and the platelet count may reach exceptionally high levels in people with essential thrombocythemia, a rare blood disease. The platelet count can be reported in units of cells per microlitre of blood (/ŒºL), 103 cells per microlitre , or 109 cells per litre The mean platelet volume (MPV) measures the average size of platelets in femtolitres. It can aid in determining the cause of thrombocytopenia; an elevated MPV may occur when young platelets are released into the bloodstream to compensate for increased destruction of platelets, while decreased production of platelets due to dysfunction of the bone marrow can result in a low MPV. The MPV is also useful for differentiating between congenital diseases that cause thrombocytopenia.Wang, SA; Hasserjian, RP (2018). p. 7. The immature platelet fraction (IPF) or reticulated platelet count is reported by some analyzers and provides information about the rate of platelet production by measuring the number of immature platelets in the blood.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). pp. 18‚Äì9. =Other tests = Reticulocyte count Blood cells stained with new methylene blue: the cells containing dark blue structures are reticulocytes. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells, which, unlike the mature cells, contain RNA. A reticulocyte count is sometimes performed as part of a complete blood count, usually to investigate the cause of a person's anemia or evaluate their response to treatment. Anemia with a high reticulocyte count can indicate that the bone marrow is producing red blood cells at a higher rate to compensate for blood loss or hemolysis, while anemia with a low reticulocyte count may suggest that the person has a condition that reduces the body's ability to produce red blood cells.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 14. When people with nutritional anemia are given nutrient supplementation, an increase in the reticulocyte count indicates that their body is responding to the treatment by producing more red blood cells.Turgeon, ML (2016). pp. 318‚Äì9 Hematology analyzers perform reticulocyte counts by staining red blood cells with a dye that binds to RNA and measuring the number of reticulocytes through light scattering or fluorescence analysis. The test can be performed manually by staining the blood with new methylene blue, which binds to RNA, and counting the percentage of red blood cells containing RNA under the microscope. The reticulocyte count is expressed as an absolute number or as a percentage of red blood cells.Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 319. Some instruments measure the average amount of hemoglobin in each reticulocyte; a parameter that has been studied as an indicator of iron deficiency in people who have conditions that interfere with standard tests.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 16. The immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) is another measurement produced by some analyzers which quantifies the maturity of reticulocytes: cells that are less mature contain more RNA and thus produce a stronger fluorescent signal. This information can be useful in diagnosing anemias and evaluating red blood cell production following anemia treatment or bone marrow transplantation.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 42‚Äì3. Nucleated red blood cells During their formation in bone marrow, and in the liver and spleen in fetuses,Harmening, DM (2009). pp. 8‚Äì10. red blood cells contain a cell nucleus, which is usually absent in the mature cells that circulate in the bloodstream. When detected, the presence of nucleated red cells, particularly in children and adults, indicates an increased demand for red blood cells, which can be caused by bleeding, some cancers and anemia. Most analyzers can detect these cells as part of the differential cell count. High numbers of nucleated red cells can cause a falsely high white cell count, which will require adjusting.Zandecki, M et al. (2007). pp. 24‚Äì5. Other parameters Advanced hematology analyzers generate novel measurements of blood cells which have shown diagnostic significance in research studies but have not yet found widespread clinical use. For example, some types of analyzers produce coordinate readings indicating the size and position of each white blood cell cluster. These parameters (termed cell population data) have been studied as potential markers for blood disorders, bacterial infections and malaria. Analyzers that use myeloperoxidase staining to produce differential counts can quantify white blood cells' expression of the enzyme, which is altered in various disorders. Some instruments can report the percentage of red blood cells that are hypochromic in addition to reporting the average MCHC value, or provide a count of fragmented red cells (schistocytes), which occur in some types of hemolytic anemia.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 90. Because these parameters are often specific to particular brands of analyzers, it is difficult for laboratories to interpret and compare results.

(2017). p. 10. Based on a statistical normal distribution, the tested samples' ranges vary with gender and age. On average, adult females have lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count values than males; although the difference lessens, but is still present, after menopause.Bain, BJ (2015). pp. 211‚Äì3. The blood of newborn babies is very different from that of older children, which is different again from the blood of adults. Newborns' hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count are extremely high to compensate for low oxygen levels in the womb, and a high proportion of fetal hemoglobin, which is less effective at delivering oxygen to tissues than mature forms of hemoglobin, inside their red blood cells.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 143.Lanzkowsky, P et al. (2016). p. 197. The MCV is also increased, and the white blood cell count is elevated with a preponderance of neutrophils.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 99. The red blood cell count and related values begin to decline shortly after birth, reaching their lowest point at about two months of age and increasing thereafter.Kaushansky, K et al. (2015). p. 103.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 220. The red blood cells of older infants and children are smaller, with a lower MCH, than those of adults. In the pediatric white blood cell differential, lymphocytes often outnumber neutrophils, while in adults neutrophils predominate. Other differences between populations may affect the reference ranges: for example, people living at higher altitudes have higher hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC results, and people of African heritage have lower white blood cell counts on average.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 214. The type of analyzer used to run the CBC affects the reference ranges as well. Reference ranges are therefore established by individual laboratories based on their own patient populations and equipment.Bain, BJ et al. (2017). pp. 8‚Äì10.Palmer, L et al. (2015). p. 296. Limitations Some medical conditions or problems with the blood sample may produce inaccurate results. If the sample is visibly clotted, which can be caused by poor phlebotomy technique, it is unsuitable for testing, because the platelet count will be falsely decreased and other results may be abnormal.Bain, BJ (2015). p. 195.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). p. 67. Samples stored at room temperature for several hours may give falsely high readings for MCV,Bain, BJ (2015). p. 194. because red blood cells swell as they absorb water from the plasma; and platelet and white blood cell differential results may be inaccurate in aged specimens, as the cells degrade over time.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 226. Red blood cell agglutination: clumps of red blood cells are visible on the blood smear Samples drawn from individuals with very high levels of bilirubin or lipids in their plasma (referred to as an icteric sample or a lipemic sample, respectively)Turgeon, ML (2016). p. 91. may show falsely high readings for hemoglobin, because these substances change the colour and opacity of the sample, which interferes with hemoglobin measurement.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012) pp. 80; 86‚Äì7. This can be avoided by replacing the plasma with saline. Some individuals produce an antibody that clumps their platelets when their blood is drawn into tubes containing EDTA, the anticoagulant typically used to collect complete blood count samples. Platelet clumps may be counted as single platelets by automated analyzers, leading to a falsely decreased platelet count. This can be avoided by using an alternative anticoagulant such as sodium citrate or heparin. Partial clotting of the sample due to a difficult blood draw is another cause of platelet clumping.Bain, BJ (2015). pp. 196‚Äì7. Another antibody-mediated condition that can affect complete blood count results is red blood cell agglutination. This phenomenon causes red blood cells to clump together because of antibodies bound to the cell surface.Rodak, BF; Carr, JH. (2013). p. 109. Red blood cell aggregates are counted as single cells by the analyzer, leading to a markedly decreased red blood cell count and hematocrit, and markedly elevated MCV and MCHC. Often, these antibodies are only active at room temperature (in which case they are called cold agglutinins), and the agglutination can be reversed by heating the sample to . Samples from people with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia may exhibit red cell agglutination that does not resolve on warming. While blast and lymphoma cells can be identified in the manual differential, microscopic examination cannot reliably determine the cells' lineage, which is often necessary for diagnosing blood cancers. After abnormal cells are identified, additional techniques such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry can be used to identify markers that provide additional information about the cells.Wang, SA; Hasserjian, RP (2018). p. 9.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). pp. 19‚Äì20. History An early hemoglobinometer: blood samples were compared to a colour chart of reference standards to determine the hemoglobin level. Before automated cell counters were introduced, complete blood count tests were performed manually: white and red blood cells, and platelets were counted using microscopes.Keohane, E et al. (2015). pp. 1‚Äì4. The first person to publish microscopic observations of blood cells was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,Kottke- Marchant, K; Davis, B. (2012). p. 1. who reported on the appearance of red cells in a 1674 letter to the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London;Wintrobe, MM. (1985). p. 10. Jan Swammerdam had described red blood cells some years earlier, but had not published his findings at the time. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, improvements in microscope technology such as achromatic lenses allowed white blood cells and platelets to be counted in unstained samples.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B. (2012). pp. 3‚Äì4. The physiologist Karl Vierordt is credited with performing the first blood count. His technique, published in 1852, involved aspirating a carefully measured volume of blood into a capillary tube and spreading it onto a microscope slide coated with egg white. After the blood dried, he counted every cell on the slide; this process could take more than three hours to complete.Davis, JD (1995). p. 167. The hemocytometer, introduced in 1874 by Louis-Charles Malassez, simplified the microscopic counting of blood cells.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). p. 4. Malassez's hemocytometer consisted of a microscope slide containing a flattened capillary tube. Diluted blood was introduced to the capillary chamber by means of a rubber tube attached to one end, and an eyepiece with a scaled grid was attached to the microscope, permitting the microscopist to count the number of cells per volume of blood. In 1877, William Gowers invented a hemocytometer with a built-in counting grid, eliminating the need to produce specially calibrated eyepieces for each microscope.Davis, JD (1995). pp. 168‚Äì71. Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky invented Romanowsky staining. In the 1870s, Paul Ehrlich developed a staining technique using a combination of an acidic and basic dye that could distinguish different types of white blood cells and allow red blood cell morphology to be examined. Dmitri Leonidovich Romanowsky improved on this technique in the 1890s, using a mixture of eosin and aged methylene blue to produce a wide range of hues not present when either of the stains was used alone. This became the basis for Romanowsky staining, a technique still used to stain blood smears for manual review. The first techniques for measuring hemoglobin were devised in the late 19th century, and involved visual comparisons of the colour of diluted blood against a known standard. Attempts to automate this process using spectrophotometry and colorimetry were limited by the fact that hemoglobin is present in the blood in many different forms, meaning that it could not be measured at a single wavelength. In 1920, a method to convert the different forms of hemoglobin to one stable form (cyanmethemoglobin or hemiglobincyanide) was introduced, allowing hemoglobin levels to be measured automatically. The cyanmethemoglobin method remains the reference method for hemoglobin measurement and is still used in many automated hematology analyzers.Keohane, E et al. (2015). p. 134.Kottke- Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). p. 5. Maxwell Wintrobe is credited with the invention of the hematocrit test. In 1929, he undertook a PhD project at the University of Tulane to determine normal ranges for red blood cell parameters, and invented a method known as the Wintrobe hematocrit. Hematocrit measurements had previously been described in the literature, but Wintrobe's method differed in that it used a large tube that could be mass-produced to precise specifications, with a built-in scale. The fraction of red blood cells in the tube was measured after centrifugation to determine the hematocrit. The invention of a reproducible method for determining hematocrit values allowed Wintrobe to define the red blood cell indices. alt=A complex tube and flask apparatus attached to a measurement station Research into automated cell counting began in the early 20th century. A method developed in 1928 used the amount of light transmitted through a diluted blood sample, as measured by photometry, to estimate the red blood cell count, but this proved inaccurate for samples with abnormal red blood cells. Other attempts, in the 1930s and 1940s, involved photoelectric detectors attached to microscopes, which would count cells as they were scanned; these methods were unsuccessful. In the late 1940s, Wallace H. Coulter, motivated by a need for better red blood cell counting methods following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, attempted to improve on photoelectric cell counting techniques. His research was aided by his brother, Joseph R. Coulter, in a basement laboratory in Chicago. Their results using photoelectric methods were disappointing, and in 1948, after reading a paper relating the conductivity of blood to its red blood cell concentration, Wallace devised the Coulter principle‚Äîthe theory that a cell suspended in a conductive medium generates a drop in current proportional to its size as it passes through an aperture. That October, Wallace built a counter to demonstrate the principle. Owing to financial constraints, the aperture was made by burning a hole through a piece of cellophane from a cigarette package. Wallace filed a patent for the technique in 1949, and in 1951 applied to the Office of Naval Research to fund the development of the Coulter counter. Wallace's patent application was granted in 1953, and after improvements to the aperture and the introduction of a mercury manometer to provide precise control over sample size, the brothers founded Coulter Electronics Inc. in 1958 to market their counters. The device was initially designed for counting red blood cells, but with later modifications it proved effective for counting white blood cells. Coulter counters were widely adopted by medical laboratories. The first analyzer able to produce multiple cell counts simultaneously was the Technicon , released in 1965. It achieved this by partitioning blood samples into two channels: one for counting red and white blood cells and one for measuring hemoglobin. However, the instrument was unreliable and difficult to maintain. In 1968, the Coulter Model S analyzer was released and gained widespread use. Similarly to the Technicon instrument, it used two different reaction chambers, one of which was used for the red cell count, and one of which was used for the white blood cell count and hemoglobin determination. The Model S also determined the mean cell volume using impedance measurements, which allowed the red blood cell indices and hematocrit to be derived. Automated platelet counts were introduced in 1970 with Technicon's Hemalog-8 instrument and were adopted by Coulter's S Plus series analyzers in 1980.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). p. 6. After basic cell counting had been automated, the white blood cell differential remained a challenge. Throughout the 1970s, researchers explored two methods for automating the differential count: digital image processing and flow cytometry. Using technology developed in the 1950s and 60s to automate the reading of Pap smears, several models of image processing analyzers were produced.Groner, W (1995). pp. 12‚Äì4. These instruments would scan a stained blood smear to find cell nuclei, then take a higher resolution snapshot of the cell to analyze it through densitometry. They were expensive, slow, and did little to reduce workload in the laboratory because they still required blood smears to be prepared and stained, so flow cytometry-based systems became more popular,Da Costa, L (2015). p. 5.Groner, W (1995). pp. 12‚Äì5. and by 1990, no digital image analyzers were commercially available in the United States or western Europe. These techniques enjoyed a resurgence in the 2000s with the introduction of more advanced image analysis platforms using artificial neural networks.Da Costa, L (2015). pp. 5‚Äì6.McCann, SR (2016). p. 193. Early flow cytometry devices shot beams of light at cells in specific wavelengths and measured the resulting absorbance, fluorescence or light scatter, collecting information about the cells' features and allowing cellular contents such as DNA to be quantified.Melamed, M (2001). pp. 5‚Äì6. One such instrument‚Äîthe Rapid Cell Spectrophotometer, developed by Louis Kamentsky in 1965 to automate cervical cytology‚Äîcould generate blood cell scattergrams using cytochemical staining techniques. Leonard Ornstein, who had helped to develop the staining system on the Rapid Cell Spectrophotometer, and his colleagues later created the first commercial flow cytometric white blood cell differential analyzer, the Hemalog D.Shapiro, HM (2003). pp. 84‚Äì5.Melamed, M. (2001). p. 8. Introduced in 1974,Picot, J et al. (2012). p. 110. this analyzer used light scattering, absorbance and cell staining to identify the five normal white blood cell types in addition to \\"large unidentified cells\\", a classification that usually consisted of atypical lymphocytes or blast cells. The Hemalog D could count 10,000 cells in one run, a marked improvement over the manual differential.Pierre, RV (2002). p. 281. In 1981, Technicon combined the Hemalog D with the Hemalog-8 analyzer to produce the Technicon H6000, the first combined complete blood count and differential analyzer. This analyzer was unpopular with hematology laboratories because it was labour-intensive to operate, but in the late 1980s to early 1990s similar systems were widely produced by other manufacturers such as Sysmex, Abbott, Roche and Beckman Coulter.Kottke-Marchant, K; Davis, B (2012). pp. 8‚Äì9.

The station is an interchange between the Bakerloo, Central and Victoria lines. As of , it is the station on the London Underground. On the Central line it is between Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road, on the Bakerloo line it is between Regent's Park and Piccadilly Circus, and on the Victoria line it is between Green Park and Warren Street. The station is in Travelcard Zone 1. The Central line station opened on 30 July 1900, and the Bakerloo line station on 10 March 1906. Both are Grade II listed. The station was rebuilt in 1912 to relieve congestion. Further congestion led to another reconstruction in 1923. Numerous improvements were made as part of the New Works Programme and as a flood protection measure. To accommodate additional passengers on the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was built. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969, including cross- platform interchange with the Bakerloo line. History =Central line= Route diagram showing the original route between Shepherd's Bush and Cornhill (Bank). In the 1890s, the Central London Railway (CLR) published a notice of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the 1890 parliamentary session. The bill planned an underground route between Shepherd's Bush and Cornhill (now Bank station). These plans were accepted by both Houses of Parliament on 5 August 1891. The CLR employed the engineers James Henry Greathead, Sir John Fowler, and Sir Benjamin Baker to design the railway. Tunnelling was completed by the end of 1898 and the official opening of the CLR (now the Central line) by the Prince of Wales took place on 27 June 1900; it was opened to the public on 30 July. Oxford Circus station opened as part of the first section of the line, between Shepherd's Bush and Bank. As part of the 1935‚Äî40 New Works Programme, the misaligned tunnels of the central section on the Central line that slowed running speeds were corrected and the platforms lengthened to accommodate longer trains. =Bakerloo line= Bakerloo line platform, 1906 In November 1891, notice was given of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the construction of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR;, now the Bakerloo line). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant & Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo. The route was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church. The works were carried out by Perry & Company of Tregedar Works, Bow. Oxford Circus was altered below ground following a Board of Trade inspection; at the end of 1905, the first test trains began running. The official opening of the BS&WR; by Sir Edwin Cornwall took place on 10 March 1906. The first section of the BS&WR; was between Baker Street and Lambeth North, then known as Kennington Road. =Victoria line= A proposal for a new underground railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an East Croydon to Finsbury Park line. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. Construction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section, where cross-platform interchange were to be provided at Oxford Circus. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969. The station opened as part of a second extension from Warren Street to Victoria. Cross-platform interchange between the Bakerloo and Victoria lines was provided by constructing the Victoria line platforms parallel to the Bakerloo ones. =Incidents and accidents= *On 13 February 1976, a bomb left in a case at the station by the Provisional IRA was discovered and safely defused. The station, at the height of the afternoon rush hour, was evacuated. *On 23 November 1984, during renovation works, the station suffered a severe fire which burned out the northbound Victoria line platform. It is believed that the fire was caused by smoking materials being pushed through a ventilation grille into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. This incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in July 1984. *On 3 March 1997, a train derailment caused the northbound Bakerloo line service between Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus to be suspended for 12 days. *On 11 August 2017, a fire occurred on a Bakerloo Line train, which was evacuated at Oxford Circus. Services were suspended between Elephant and Castle and Paddington. *On 24 November 2017, a fight between passengers on the westbound Central line platform caused a mass panic and stampede that led to 16 injuries. Station building =Bakerloo and Central lines= The CLR and BSWR had separate surface buildings and lift shafts. The station buildings, which remain today as exits from the station, were built on very confined plots on either side of Argyll Street on the south side of Oxford Street, just east of the circus itself. The stations as originally built were entirely separate, but connecting passages were soon provided at platform level. The surviving Central London Railway building to the east of Argyll Street is the best surviving example of stations designed by Harry Bell Measures, and the Bakerloo line building to the west is a classic Leslie Green structure. Both are Grade II listed since 20 July 2011. The busy Central line platform, as seen in December 2004, showing its narrow width. Almost from the outset, overcrowding has been a constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with this. After much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built in the basement of the Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR lifts still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an exit route from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building. The station was closed between 31 August and 20 November 1939 to facilitate flood protection works for the preparation of The Second World War. Although street access was closed, trains still called, and interchange between the Bakerloo and Central lines was still possible within the station. =Victoria line= Station reconstruction to accommodate the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, with the existing structure to be used as exits with the lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for five and a half years (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the \\"umbrella\\" covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical diameter concrete foundations, sunk from deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. Service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A pre-stressed concrete raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson's third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel. The interchange passageway between the Central line and the Bakerloo line in the area of the former junction with the Bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel. From there, a pilot tunnel Ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in the former Bakerloo line lift shaft. A new substation for the Bakerloo line was built at the bottom of the shaft. With the additional escalators in place, the one-way circulation scheme was introduced and the remaining lifts were removed. The station today In 2007 the station underwent a major modernisation, removing the murals installed on the Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style similar to those used when the station opened in 1900. The wall tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Leslie Green. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans Unger on the Victoria line platforms were restored, which were originally installed in 1969. These motifs symbolise the circle of the Oxford Circus junction, with the criss-crossed lines as the Bakerloo, Central and Victoria lines. Oxford Circus station has 14 escalators. Major escalator refurbishment took place in 2010‚Äì11. Platform humps were also installed at the station to provide step-free access from the platforms onto the trains. The Victoria line humps resemble in form the Harrington Hump. =Station architecture= The exit at Oxford Circus station, designed by Harry Bell Measures. On 20 July 2011, the separate station buildings were given Grade II status by the Tourism and Heritage Minister on the advice of English Heritage. Part of the reason was the consistency of the design shown by architect Leslie Green on several stations. The station building on the northeast corner of Argyll Street and Oxford Street was designed by Harry Bell Measures. The upper storey offices designed by Delissa Joseph were later added in 1908. The building as a whole was described as a \\"vigorous and well-detailed composition\\" and the best preserved. This design of the station resembles the traditional design of a Central London Railway (CLR) station. The materials used are of pinkish-buff terracotta and red brick with slate roof. The detailed description of the facade is quoted below: > \\"Wholly terracotta-clad with Mannerist detailing: pilasters flanking the > entrances have capitals broken by masks and scroll brackets, supporting a > cornice and frieze with moulded swags and cornucopias. Short elevation to > Oxford Street contains main entrance (now exit), a broad segmental archway, > originally glazed with timber mullions and now containing an openwork > transom panel with diamond bracing. Large cartouche above rising into a > gable, its cherub finial now lost. Long elevation to Argyll Street has two > smaller segment-headed entrances, that to left cut down from an original > window, and between them two similar openings containing shops. In centre, > narrower doorway with glazed overlight gives access to upper floors. Curved > corner section contains a metal-framed kiosk with bowed side sections > bearing monograms, added before 1927 and now blocked.\\" Opposite the Measures's building, the original two-storey Bakerloo line entrance was designed by Leslie Green which resembles the original architecture of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR;) stations. It is the only station to have the original tiled signage and a cartouche bearing the Underground Electric Railways (UERL) company insignia retained. Like other original BS&WR; station designs, it features ox-blood red terracotta and a brick-clad steel frame. The terracotta was manufactured by Leeds Fireclay Co. Ltd. Unlike the other building, the offices above are not Grade II listed. The station name is carved with raised gilded lettering on the lower frieze to Argyll Street and Oxford Street. Services and connections =Services= A Bakerloo line train arrives at the northbound platform, looking south. Bakerloo line On this line, the station is between Regent's Park and Piccadilly Circus stations. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) operating during off-peak hours weekdays and all day Saturday is as follows: * 11tph northbound to Queen's Park * 3tph northbound to Stonebridge Park (via Queen's Park) * 6tph northbound to Harrow & Wealdstone (via Queen's Park and Stonebridge Park) * 20tph southbound to Elephant & Castle Central line On this line, the station is between Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road stations. Trains generally run between West Ruislip and Epping, and between Ealing Broadway and Hainault (via Newbury Park), with some trains on the latter route continuing to Woodford via Grange Hill. The general frequency between trains is 3‚Äì10 minutes. Night Tube services on Friday and Saturday nights generally operate 6tph in each direction. The typical night tube service as of 2018 is: *3tph eastbound to Hainault via Newbury Park *3tph eastbound to Loughton *3tph westbound to Ealing Broadway *3tph westbound to White City Victoria line On this line, the station is located between Warren Street and Green Park. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is 27 trains per hour in each direction to Walthamstow Central and Brixton, with reduced frequencies of six trains per hour during Night Tube operations. =Connections= London Bus routes 7, 12, 22, 55, 73, 88, 94, 98, 113, 139, 159, 390, 453 and C2, and night routes N3, N7, N8, N15, N18, N22, N55, N73, N98, N109, N113, N136, N137 and N207 serve the station.

History Pearson & Sons Bakery opened in Massachusetts in 1792, and they made a biscuit called pilot bread for consumption on long sea voyages. In 1889, William Moore acquired Pearson & Sons Bakery, Josiah Bent Bakery, and six other bakeries to start the New York Biscuit Company. Adolphus Green (1843‚Äì1917) started the American Biscuit and Manufacturing Company in 1890 after acquiring 40 different bakeries. Then Moore, Green, and John G. Zeller (Richmond Steam Bakery) all merged in 1898 to form the National Biscuit Company, and Green was named president. Zeller was president of National Biscuit Company from 1923‚Äì1931. Nabisco celebrated its golden anniversary in 1948, and Nabisco had become the corporate name by 1971. In 1981, Nabisco merged with Standard Brands to form Nabisco Brands, which merged with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1985 to form RJR Nabisco. Kraft General Foods acquired the Nabisco cold cereals from RJR Nabisco in 1993, and the cereal brands are now owned by Post Holdings. In 1999, Nabisco acquired Favorite Brands International. In 2000, Philip Morris Companies Inc. acquired Nabisco and merged it with Kraft Foods in one of the largest mergers in the food industry. In 2011, Kraft Foods announced that it was splitting into a grocery company and a snack food company. Nabisco became part of the snack- food business, which took the name Mondelƒìz International. National Biscuit Company and Quincy Biscuit wagon advertising \\"Uneeda Biscuit\\" in Boston, Massachusetts in 1899 The first use of the name Nabisco was in a cracker brand produced by National Biscuit Company in 1901.

P. 555. and Famous Chocolate Wafers (1924). In 1924, the National Biscuit Company introduced a snack in a sealed packet called the Peanut Sandwich Packet. They soon added the Sorbetto Sandwich Packet. These allowed salesmen to sell to soda fountains, road stands, milk bars, lunch rooms, and news stands. Sales increased, and the company started to use the name NAB in 1928. The term Nabs today is used to generically mean any type of snack crackers, most commonly in the southern US.

It also acquired F.H. Bennett Company, maker of Milk- Bone dog biscuits, in 1931. When Kraft bought Nabisco, it included Christie. In 1981, Nabisco merged with Standard Brands, maker of Planters Nuts, Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bars, Royal gelatin, Fleischmann's and Blue Bonnet margarines, amongst others. The company was then renamed Nabisco Brands, Inc. At that time, it also acquired the Life Savers brand from the E.R. Squibb Company, makers of Bubble Yum & Care-free gum. Commercials were revised as a result of the merger by January 1983. =R. J. Reynolds merger= In 1985, Nabisco was bought by R.J. Reynolds, forming RJR Nabisco. After three years of mixed results, the company became one of the hotspots in the 1980s leveraged buyout mania. The company was in auction with two bidders: F. Ross Johnson, the company's president and CEO, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a private equity partnership. The company was sold to KKR in what was then the biggest leveraged buyout in history, described in the book Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and a subsequent film. =Subsequent acquisitions and divestitures= In 1989 RJR Nabisco Inc. sold its Chun King foods division to Yeo Hiap Seng Limited and Fullerton Holdings Pte. Ltd for $52 million to reduce its debt from its $24.5 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. In December 1989 RJR Nabisco sold its Del Monte canned fruits and vegetables business in South America to Polly Peck International PLC. One year later, in 1990 RJR Nabisco sold Curtiss Candy, which owned the Baby Ruth and Butterfinger brands, to Nestle. RJR also sold LU, Belin and other European biscuit brands to Groupe Danone, only reunited in 2007 after Nabisco's present parent, Kraft Foods, bought Danone's biscuit operations for EUR 5.3 billion. In 1994 RJR sold its breakfast cereal business (primarily the Shredded Wheat franchise) to Kraft Foods and the international licenses to General Mills, which later became part of the Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture with Nestle. Also in 1994, RJR acquired Knox Gelatin and integrated the Shredded Wheat franchise into the Post Foods portfolio. Post continues to sell the product today. In 1995 Nestle agreed to buy the Ortega Mexican foods business from Nabisco Inc. That same year, RJR-Nabisco also acquired the North American margarine and table spreads business of Kraft foods. This purchase included Parkay, Touch of Butter and Chiffon. In 1998 Nabisco Holdings announced its sale of its margarine and egg substitute business to ConAgra of Omaha. In 1997 the brands of Fleishmann's, Blue Bonnet and Parkay had sales of $480 million. It also sold its College Inn broth brand to HJ Heinz and its Venezuelan Del Monte operations to Del Monte Foods. In 1999 RJR Nabisco's food and tobacco empire fell apart when they sold its international tobacco division to Japan Tobacco for $7.8 billion. The Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris) acquired Nabisco (sans Bubble Yum which was sold to Hershey) in 2000 for about $19.2 billion. Philip Morris then combined Nabisco with Kraft. That acquisition was approved by the Federal Trade Commission subject to the divestiture of products in five areas: three Jell-O and Royal brands types of products (dry- mix gelatin dessert, dry-mix pudding, no-bake desserts), intense mints (such as Altoids), and baking powder. Kraft Foods, at the time also a subsidiary of Altria, merged with Nabisco. In 2006 Nabisco sold its Milk-Bone pet snacks to Del Monte Foods Co. for $580 million. Kraft Foods was spun off from Altria, taking its Nabisco subsidiary with it, in 2007. In January 2007 Cream of Wheat was sold to B&G; Foods. Legal battles In 1997, the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus became concerned with an ad campaign for Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts. The initial commercial featured a man and monkey deserted on an island. They discover a crate of Planters peanuts and rejoice in the peanuts' positive health facts. Nabisco made a detailed statement describing how their peanuts were healthier than most other snack products, going as far as comparing the nutritional facts of Planters peanuts to those of potato chips, Cheddar cheese chips, and popcorn. Technically, the commercials complied with United States Food and Drug Administration regulations, and they were allowed to continue. However, as requested by the National Advertising Division, Nabisco agreed to make fat content disclosure more conspicuous in future commercials. The company's A1 Steak Sauce was the subject of a legal battle against a venue called Arnie's Deli in 1991. The delicatessen was selling and using a homemade sauce called \\"A2 Sauce.\\" The verdict favored Nabisco. NASCAR sponsorship From 2002‚Äì2005, Nabisco and Kraft jointly sponsored both Dale Earnhardt, Inc., and Roush Racing.

Countdown stores are normally larger than the average New Zealand supermarket. The first Countdown store opened in 1981 and the chain has expanded to 180 stores . It is the largest single supermarket chain in New Zealand in terms of number of stores, although the rival Four Square chain has a larger number of premises including smaller retail stores in rural areas.  History  In May 1981, the first Countdown market opened at Northlands Mall in Papanui, Christchurch. This business was established by Rattrays Wholesale. The Rattrays Wholesale Group included the Rattrays Cash and Carry warehouses, tobacco vans, now known as the Red Arrow Distributors fleet, and also included the SuperValue group of franchised supermarkets. In 2006, Foodland Associated Limited (FAL) Australia, purchased the Countdown/Rattrays business. This acquisition was then followed by gaining a majority shareholding in Progressive Enterprises Limited, including General Distributors Limited, trading as Foodtown. In October 1993, Foodland Associated Limited (FAL) bought the majority shareholding in Progressive Enterprises from Coles Myer and, shortly after, bought all remaining public shares and delisted Progressive Enterprises from the New Zealand stock exchange. With this purchase, Progressive Enterprises became the parent company for a number of FAL brands. Progressive Enterprises consisted of Foodtown Supermarkets, Countdown, Georgie Pie, Rattrays and Supervalue. On 17 June 2002, Progressive Enterprises bought Woolworths (NZ) Ltd from Hong Kong-based owners Dairy Farm Group. The sale saw Progressive Enterprises's supermarket brands Foodtown, Countdown, 3 Guys, SuperValue and FreshChoice joined by Woolworths, Big Fresh and Price Chopper. As a result, Progressive Enterprises increased its share of the New Zealand grocery market to approximately 45%. In 2003 Progressive Enterprises closed its Auckland and Christchurch distribution centres and rehired the redundant workers. During the period of 1993‚Äì2005, Countdown changed from a foodmarket type format offering mainly groceries to a \\"full-service discount supermarket\\". The stores vary in size due to the consolidation of brands after the merger with Woolworths (NZ) Ltd. A number of Big Fresh, Price Chopper, and 3 Guys stores were rebranded to Countdown stores during after this merger. On 24 November 2005, Australian company Woolworths Limited purchased Progressive Enterprises from Foodland Associated Limited. In October 2006, Progressive Enterprises announced a discount fuel scheme with Gull Petroleum and Shell to offer discounts on petrol when shoppers spend $40 or more in their Woolworths, Foodtown or Countdown stores. This scheme was similar to the one their parent company Woolworths Limited offered in Australia. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigated whether this activity was anticompetitive, the result of which was an undertaking by the parent company to change its methods of offering fuel discounts in Australia. Foodstuffs stores in New Zealand also offered fuel discounts at BP and their own New World and Pak'nSave fuel sites. In July 2008, Onecard, which could previously only be used at Woolworths and Foodtown, was extended to Countdown. In September 2009, Progressive Enterprises announced it would re-brand all its Foodtown and Woolworths stores to Countdown as stores were refurbished. The final Foodtown and Woolworths to re-brand were Browns Bay and Meadowlands respectively, both on 14 November 2011. A single Woolworths outlet continued to operate at Mount Maunganui's Bayfair Shopping Centre up until late 2018. The store was not rebranded because a Countdown already existed at the centre. The store has now been closed due to the centre expanding. Johnsonville and Upper Hutt in the Wellington region both have two Countdown stores less than apart - the result of one pre-existing Countdown store and one larger rebranded Woolworths store. Both stores stock a similar range of products. The same situation occurs in Napier, where two Countdown stores are directly across the road from each other. In terms of branding, the Countdown stores existing before the initial rebranding generally retain the old style logo (although some have been updated) but the rebranded Woolworth/Foodtown stores have been updated to display the new style logo. On 10 December 2012, Countdown launched its first Countdown branded in-store pharmacy. On 3 November 2014, Countdown began selling low-cost travel and life insurance through a deal with insurance giant Cigna. On 1 August 2016, Countdown began its partnership with BP and Caltex through the AA Smartfuel program to offer fuel discounts, replacing its partnership with Z. The partnership with Gull continued until October 2016. In 2019, a quiet-hour was introduced to the supermarkets for customers who had ear or eye sensitivities. Operations As of September 2018 there are a total of 180 Countdown supermarkets operating throughout the North and South Islands of New Zealand. Major store operations are handled in Woolworths NZ's head office in Mangere, Auckland. The stores are divided in between 10 areas. Each area has an Area Manager (or Group Manager as they are sometimes called), and all areas are supported by a National Operations Manager. Previously, the areas were split into North and South regions, with 5 areas each. Pricing and specials are divided into two regions: North Island and South Island. Internally, the North Island region is further subdivided into two sub-divisions: Upper and Lower. Countdown also provides New Zealand wide online grocery delivery (excluding Waiheke Island) services through its online grocery shop. \\"New Generation\\" Countdowns - those that have been built or refurbished since mid-2008 - have 30% of their retail floor space dedicated to fresh foods, a wider range of products than older Countdown stores (up to 30,000 items), and heating and refrigeration systems that are more energy-efficient and sustainable than older Countdown stores. = Logistics = All grocery items and general merchandise is supplied to stores through one of four distribution centres: at the head office in Auckland (National DC), one in Wiri (Upper North Island DC), in Palmerston North (Lower North Island), and in Christchurch (South Island). Deliveries are made daily to stores. Chilled and frozen goods are supplied to stores by third party logistics operator Versacold. They operate three distribution centers in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch, and deliver to stores daily. Produce is supplied to stores by third party Freshmax. Fruit and vegetables from across New Zealand and the world are sent to the three distribution centers in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, where they are shipped to stores daily. However, only certain stores receive a Sunday delivery. In recent years, Countdown has moved away from having on-site butcheries and have moved to centralized facilities. Cabinet Ready Meat (CRM: pre-cut and pre- packed meat) is supplied to non-butchery stores from a central plant in Auckland. Due to the complications of logistics in shipping CRM to the South Island, all South Island Countdowns have retained their butcheries.  Competition  Countdown's main competitors are both owned by co-operative Foodstuffs Limited - the other player in the New Zealand supermarket duopoly - in the form of full-service supermarket chain New World (with 140 stores across NZ) and lower-cost 'food warehouse' PAK'nSAVE (57 supermarkets mainly concentrated in large, urban/suburban areas). In terms of pricing, Countdown generally places on par with New World and above Pak n Save. In a September 2009 Consumer magazine survey, Countdown was placed third in Auckland, with a basket of 40 brand items costing $136, four dollars above New World and $21 above Pak'n Save. A year earlier in September 2008, a Consumer magazine survey placed Countdown second in Auckland, with a basket of 15 private label items costing $38.24, only $0.91 behind fellow Progressive Enterprises's brand Woolworths (the Woolworths store in question has since become a Countdown), and $1.87 ahead of the nearest rival, Pak'n Save. The current Countdown (supermarket) logo introduced in 2018 Marketing and branding Former Countdown (supermarket) logo used up until 2009. This logo still exists on some stores. 143x143px The current Countdown branding was introduced on 21 September 2009. The word \\"Countdown\\" reused the original logo's red colour, but with a newly adapted font-type. The previous light green background was replaced with a white one and a logo with the \\"Shop Smarter\\" slogan was added. The logo - representing fresh produce - is also used by Australian Woolworths outlets. As of 2018, the font used in the logo was changed to one more similar to the Australian Woolworths, and itself is dark green, but when used on stores it is white. On stores, the slogan is missing and the word \\"Countdown\\" is white. The logo and name sit on a dark grey background. On newer Countdowns, however (those built after 2013) the logo and name sit on a dark green background. Some older stores still have the old branding, which is the lettering 'Countdown' in red or orange on either a light or dark green background. \\"Shop Smarter\\" - Countdown's current slogan was introduced in mid-2009 to the Countdown, Woolworths and Foodtown brands. The new slogan also accompanied the introduction of \\"The Smart Shopper\\", a series of 60-second twice-weekly television segment hosted by Richard Till. = Countdown Kids Hospital Appeal = From August to November every year, every Countdown store around the country fundraisers to help sick children around the country. Some of the ways the raise money include, selling $2 wristbands, and $5 raffle tickets for purchase by customers. = Food donations = In 2011 Countdown put a formal structure in place, partnering with the Salvation Army to launch Countdown Food Rescue. This nationwide program ensures that food that can't be sold but is still fit for consumption is put to good use. They also donate a large trolley full of food from each of their 180 stores every year at Christmas.  Loyalty schemes  Countdown has two major loyalty schemes called Onecard and Onecard Visa =Onecard= Countdown uses a discount and rewards programme called \\"OneCard\\" which was introduced in July 2003 and was shared by the Woolworths and Foodtown brands. The actual Onecard is a standard magnetic stripe card that is loaded into the POS system via the EFTPOS terminal. Countdown's Onecard specials are the predominantly visible price on member-discounted products. The non-promotional price is displayed below. Onecard VISA Onecard VISA is a VISA card based on Onecard. It is the same as the regular VISA cards and has additional rewards features. =Fuel discounts= Introduced in 2006, Countdown supermarkets began offering fuel discounts for transactions of $40 and over (as of September 2009). In August 2016 fuel discounts redeemable at BP, Caltex and Gull petrol stations replaced the former arrangement with Shell/Z.  Private label brands  Countdown has nine private label brands - of which all except Signature Range and 'Countdown' branded products are in common with private label brands of Woolworths Supermarkets Australia. * Countdown Value / Countdown Everyday / Countdown Finest - branding for fresh items, replacing the old 'Fresh Zone' brand. * Woolworths Homebrand - low-cost everyday grocery items * Signature Range - everyday grocery items, on par with branded products (previously owned by (FAL) Foodland Associated Limited in Western Australia which operated the Action Supermarkets, Supa Valu and Dewsons. * Woolworths Select / Signature Range Select - high-end grocery products * Woolworths Naytura * Woolworths Freefrom / Free From Gluten - grocery items for specific dietary requirements * Macro / Macro Free Range / Macro Organic - grocery products sustained from organic and free range sources) * Woolworths Essentials - general merchandise * Gold - High-end speciality grocery products In 2016 Countdown began the process of merging their Homebrand, Select and Signature Range brands to their Woolworths Essentials and Countdown Value / Everyday / Finest Brand. The Homebrand brand will be converted to Essentials and the Select and Signature range to the Countdown brand over the course of 2016, 2017 and 2018. This re- branding is expected to be completed by 2018. Countdown will still retain the Free From, Macro and Gold Brands See also * Woolworths (New Zealand) * Woolworths Supermarkets (Australia) * Albert Gubay References External links * Supermarkets of New Zealand Retail companies established in 1981 Woolworths Group (Australia) 1981 establishments in New Zealand ","title":"Countdown (supermarket)"},{"id":"241582","text":"Andrew Pickens, Jr. (December 13, 1779June 24, 1838) was an American soldier and politician. He served as the 46th Governor of South Carolina from 1816 until 1818. Pickens was the son of well-known American Revolutionary general Andrew Pickens (1739-1817), and Rebecca Floride Pickens (nee Colhoun). He was born on his father's plantation on the Savannah River in Horse Creek Valley in Edgefield County, South Carolina. He was a maternal cousin of fellow South Carolina politician John C. Calhoun. He was also a paternal cousin of Calhoun's wife Floride. He was raised a Presbyterian and educated at the College of New Jersey. Pickens served as a lieutenant-colonel in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812. After the war, he established a plantation, \\"Oatlands\\", in Edgefield County, and took up the practice of law. He also established a residence, \\"Halcyon Grove\\", in the village of Edgefield, and married Susannah Smith Wilkinson. On December 5, 1816, the South Carolina General Assembly elected Pickens as governor by secret ballot. Pickens championed the construction of roads and canals by government, a policy called internal improvements. During his administration, South Carolina began an internal improvements program. The price of cotton rose to the highest point reached in South Carolina during the antebellum period. The city of Charleston was struck with a disastrous yellow fever epidemic. After leaving office, Pickens moved to Alabama and helped negotiate a treaty with the Creek Indians of Georgia. For a period of time around 1829, he lived in Augusta. Growing up living by Indians, he had a very tight bond with them. Pickens died June 24, 1838, in Pontotoc, Mississippi, and was interred at Old Stone Church Cemetery in Clemson, South Carolina.The South Carolina Encyclopedia Guide to the Governors of South Carolina, p. 198 His son, Francis Wilkinson Pickens (1805-1869) was a U.S. Representative and the Governor of South Carolina when the state seceded from the Union in 1860.

The aircraft is connected to the operator by a pair of lines, attached to a handle, that work the elevator of the model. This allows the model to be controlled in the pitch axis. It is constrained to fly on the surface of a hemisphere by the control lines. The control lines are usually either stranded stainless steel cable or solid metal wires of anywhere from to . Sewing thread or braided fishing line may be used instead of wires, but air resistance is greater. A third line is sometimes used to control the engine throttle, and more lines may be added to control other functions. Electrical signals sent over the wires are sometimes used in scale models to control functions such as retracting undercarriage and flaps. There is also a control system that uses a single solid wire, this is called Monoline. When the pilot twists the wire around its axis, a spiral inside the airplane spins to move the elevator. While it can be used with some success on any type of model, it is best for speed models where the reduced aerodynamic drag of the single line is a significant advantage. The control provided is not as precise as the two-line control system. Almost all control-line models are powered with conventional model aircraft engines of various types. It is possible to fly control-line models that do not use on-board propulsion, in a mode called \\"whip-powered\\", where the pilot \\"leading\\" the model, whose lines are attached to a fishing or similar pole, supplying the necessary energy to keep the airplane aloft, in a fashion similar to kite-flying. History Early versions merely constrained the model to fly in a circle but offered no control. This is known as Round-the-pole flying. The origins of control-line flight are obscure but the first person to use a recognizable system that controlled the control surfaces on the model, is generally considered to be Oba St. Clair, in June 1936, near Gresham, Oregon.http://obastclair.com/ St. Clair's system used a rather large apparatus similar to a television antenna, onto which many lines were attached. This system is very different from those currently in use on modern control line models. It is of interest to note that St. Clair only produced one model to use this system, which he called \\"The Full House\\", the Miss Shirley; and to date, there is no evidence to show anyone else ever built a plane to use the Full House system. The name most associated with the inventions and promotion of control line, and the inventor of the formerly patented system known as \\"U-Control\\" (which was a trademark, and is the system in use on virtually every two-line control line model today) was Nevilles E. \\" Jim\\" Walker.http://www.americanjuniorclassics.com/ His \\"American Junior\\" company was by far the biggest producer of models, and held numerous patents on the two-line system until overturned during a patent infringement suit, by Walker, against Leroy M Cox, based on \\"prior art\\" from St. Clair in the 1955 trial.Thornburg, Dave: Do you Speak Model Airplane, page 142-157. Pony X Press, 1992. One of the most coveted prizes in control-line aerobatics competition sanctioned by the AMA, awarded to the winner of a flyoff between the US Junior, Senior, and Open age class Champions, was originally provided by and is named for Walker. This is one of the oldest perpetual trophies in modeling that is still awarded. The airframe Control-line models are built of the same basic materials and construction methods as R/C and free flight models. Control-line model construction varies with the category of model. Aerobatics and combat models are relatively lightly built compare to R/C models as they need high maneuverability in the limited space offered by the control line hemisphere. They are typically built with traditional materials like balsa wood, plywood, paper, plastic, spruce, and polystyrene foam, but modern composite and graphite/epoxy are occasionally used in high-load applications. Combat models must also be relatively easy and quick to build, as mid-air collisions and crashes are common. Aerobatic model construction is typically quite complex and may require many hundreds of hours. Speed models must be very sturdy to withstand the forces of line tension and to permit a very rigid engine mount for maximum engine performance. Speed models are generally built around an aluminum or magnesium \\"pan\\" that forms about half the fuselage. Little or no maneuverability required, as once at speed the model's altitude is maintained by centripetal Acceleration. Racing models need to be both relatively light for good acceleration from the start, or after a pit stop, and to reduce the pitch of the airfoil required to maintain lift. Race Aircraft also be fairly strong to withstand the pit man catching the model after landing. To control the airplane, the lines must remain in tension. Centripetal Acceleration is generally sufficient to maintain line tension if the airplane is properly \\"trimmed\\" (adjusted), but sometimes additional features such as rudder offset and engine offset are added to provide extra tension. It is of interest to note, that when a control line model does a loop, it no longer flies on the edge of a hemisphere, but traverses the edge of a cone, a planar path, and the motion of the model produces no centripetal acceleration. In the condition of flying a loop, other factors must therefore provide the line tension, such as engine offset, or lead-out rake. Weight in the outboard wing tip is usually used to balance the weight of the lines. Top aerobatics models typically have a large number of adjustable features like tip weight boxes, adjustable rudder offset, adjustable line sweep, and adjustable elevator and flap controls. Some aerobatics models use a variable rudder system (commonly called the Rabe rudder after its inventor, Al Rabe) to vary the rudder offset during flight. The adjustment of the various adjustable features on a modern stunt model can become quite complex.Buck, B. W.:\\"Stunt News\\", ISSN 1076-2604, Volume 32, Issue 2 (March/April 2006), \\"Functions of Trim Adjustments\\", page 62-67 Many models also feature a longer inboard wing; aerobatics models use this to balance the lift from side-to-side, compensating for the difference in velocity from inboard to outboard wing, while some speed models use only an inboard wing, which eliminates the drag of the outboard wing completely (these models are colloquially referred to as \\"Sidewinders\\"). In general 2/3rds of the aerodynamic drag of the entire control line model systems (Plane, Lead- Outs, Lines/Connectors, Handle) is created by the lines/connectors. In general there are two types of fuselage construction that are used in control line: \\"profile\\" (flat) and \\"built up\\". These are built with differing types of wings depending on the specific use of the aircraft. Profile models, where the fuselage is cut out from a single relatively thin sheet of wood with the \\"profile\\" of the airplane, are simple to build and repair, and are very common on trainer models. Sometimes the vibration of the engine causes poor engine runs on profile models. Built-up fuselages are much more difficult to build but generally look better and offer superior engine runs. Controls The aircraft is typically controlled by a set of 20‚Äì70-foot lines usually of multi strand stainless steel, single strands of piano wire, or G.S.U.M.P. (Gel Spun Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, made by DuPont). For sport flying, non-metallic lines of kevlar, dacron, or other low-stretch fiber materials are commonly used. This type of control was originally trademarked as \\"U-Control\\" and is by far the most common control method.Walker, Nevilles E.:\\"Controlled Captive Type Toy Airplane\\", USPTO Patent 2292416, December 26, 1940http://www.americanjuniorclassics.com/Workshop/ucontrolpatent.htm The controls of a conventional 2-line/\\"U-Control\\" system consist of lead-out cables, a bellcrank, push rods and control horns. These are connected so that differential motion of the lines rotates the bellcrank, causing a pushrod to move either forward or aft. The pushrod is connected to the control surface with a control horn that moves the elevator (and flaps, if used) up and down. The pilot holds a handle to which the lines are attached. Tilting the handle with the fingers, wrist, and/or elbow motion causes the differential movement in the lines. By convention, tilting the hand so the top is closer to the pilot than the bottom results in \\"up\\" elevator, much like pulling back on a full-scale airplane control stick. Also by convention, most airplanes are flown nominally counter-clockwise as viewed from above, with the leadout cables exiting the left wing. This is not universal and some pilots fly in the opposite direction. Flying clockwise has a slight advantage in some situations because most engines run so that the torque will roll the airplane away from the pilot, increasing line tension in upright level flight. The controls can be expanded by adding a third line that controls the throttle. The most common system for throttle control is that devised by J. Robert Smurthwait, of Baker Oregon, and is widely available. The throttle is usually a conventional carburetor as used on radio control models schemes that couple limited rudder and/or aileron, and variable leadout position are often found on carrier planes as well as elevator and flaps/ Monoline control works by twisting the single line. The pilot holds a handle with a twisted flat piece of metal on bearings in one hand, and a \\"bobbin\\" in the other. Moving bobbin towards or away from the handle twists the line. Inside the airplane, the rotating line rotates a spiral scroll with a follower. The follower moves toward and away from the pivot of the scroll, and has a pushrod attached. Then, as the scroll rotates, the pushrod moves fore and aft. The rest of the system is like the two-line system. The control of a monoline system is much less precise than a two-line system because the line itself tends to twist up before it moves the scroll, leading to a somewhat vague control response with considerable lag. It does however have the advantage of not requiring as much line tension to move the controls, and the single line has less drag than the two slightly smaller lines used in conventional two-line control. Other control methods were devised early on to avoid having to pay royalties on the \\"U-Control\\" patent, including systems with the lines connected directly to the elevator with pulleys to change the pitch, methods that connected the lines directly to the pushrod through screw eyes, but most worked very poorly compared to conventional 2-line control. Power Control-Line airplanes usually have a power plant of to , although engines can be as large as .90, or may have electric power. Two-stroke glow engines are most common, but almost any form of model engine has been used, including pulse jet engines and turbojets. Control-line models tend to have very high power-to-weight ratios compared to R/C models or full-scale aircraft. The size of the engines and the models are significantly limited by the maximum line length of used for competition, although very long lines (as much as 150 feet) have been used on rare occasions. The competition categories that need high power output and speed can turn at very high rotational speeds for a reciprocating engine. A engine used in the FAI Speed event may produce as much as at rotational speeds in the range of 45000 rpm - faster than some full-scale turbojets. The specific output is around 1200 hp/liter which is far in excess of racing motorcycle engines or Formula 1 auto racing engines. Many breakthroughs in two-stroke engine design (both model and motorcycle) can be traced back to C/L speed models, as the small size makes it easy to experiment with new designs at low cost. Control line models tend to run a varying mix of fuel however 10% nitromethane, 20% castor oil and 70% methanol is common. Castor oil is sometimes replaced by synthetics, however as control line aircraft typically run at high throttle settings for the entire flight, castor oil generally provides better lubrication and cooling and is thus considered safer for the engine. It is however somewhat viscous and the resulting oil drag can rob some power compared to synthetic oil, and can also lead to \\"varnishing\\" of the cylinder. Some older-technology engines commonly used for control line can be very quickly damaged with typical R/C fuels because of low oil content. Pulse jet models use gasoline, a variety of flammable liquids like acetone, methyl- ethyl-ketone, and other similar fluids. Pulse-jet models are started by applying a continuous spark device (e.g. a \\"buzzer coil\\" as used on a Fordson tractor) to a spark plug in the side of the combustion chamber, and then using a bicycle pump or pressurized air to blow air across the fuel injector and into the engine. When a flammable mixture is present in the engine, it will detonate, sending a shock wave down the tail pipe and creating suction at the intake end of the engine, sucking in more fuel/air, and creates another explosion. Once started, the engine becomes hot very quickly and no longer requires the spark. The spark box and air source are disconnected and then model launched as quickly as possible to prevent the heat generated by the engine from causing the airplane to catch fire. The engine is extremely loud in operation and cannot be muffled, and can be heard for miles under the right conditions. The propellers used for control-line models are commonly made of wood (usually maple), fiberglass-reinforced plastic (GRP), or graphite/kevlar/fiberglass and epoxy. The propeller pitch and diameter are chosen based on the engine size, type of performance desired, and cost. A typical .61-sized piped engine uses a 3-bladed propellor around 12-13\\" in diameter and around 4\\" of pitch, and is usually made of graphite/epoxy. A .20-sized sport model might use an inexpensive 8\\" diameter, 4\\" pitch propellor made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic. The graphite stunt propellers are usually made in small production runs or even by hand, and can cost as much as $50. Small GRP sport propellers are made by injection molding and may cost as little as $2. The fuel for the engine is usually held in a metal or plastic fuel tank, shaped so that fuel is drawn from the outside edge of the tank, as the fuel tends to be thrown to the side by centrifugal force as the airplane travels in a circle. A \\"clunk tank\\" as used in R/C is satisfactory, but dedicated tanks with wedge-shaped cross-sections are frequently used and tend to have better characteristics as the fuel runs out. A tank with a vent on the inner edge, or multiple vents, is usually called a 'suction' tank. The pressure of fuel delivery with a suction tank changes as the fuel runs out, causing the engine mixture ratio to become leaner as the flight proceeds. Tanks vented to only permit air to enter at the outside edge (\\"uniflow\\" tanks) provide constant fuel pressure over the duration of the flight and a constant mixture ratio. Combat and some speed models use rubber tubing (\\"bladder\\" tank), baby pacifiers, or fountain pen ink bladders, inflated with fuel from a large syringe, to hold the fuel under fairly high pressure. The fuel line is pinched off to prevent fuel loss until the engine is started. The high pressure of fuel delivery permits the use of a larger intake on the engine, allowing more air flow than would otherwise be possible, and thus more power. This type of fuel delivery is by far the most steady until the fuel finally runs out. The carburetion on most control-line engines is a simple fixed-size orifice (venturi) with only a mixture ratio adjustment. The engine can be run over a very wide range of mixtures and adjusting the needle valve can be used to adjust the engine speed over a small range. Once released, the engine runs at a more-or-less constant speed until the fuel runs out, or, if equipped, the fuel-shutoff is activated. Altering the size of the venturi used can be used to adjust the gross power. Two-stroke glow motors can be made to run in a 4-stroke mode where the engine mis-fires on every other stroke, and changes mode of firing based on load of the propeller. A tremendous degree of control over how the engine runs in flight is possible by altering the fuel contents, propeller size, pitch, and pitch distribution, venturi size, compression ratio of the engine, and the length of the tuned exhaust, if used. Landing gear The landing gear/undercarriage on control line aircraft can vary from basic piano wire and wheels to competition models with spring-loaded shock absorption and wheel pants. Retractable landing gear is common on scale models and is occasionally used in stunt. Most speed and combat models omit the landing gear in the interest of drag and weight reduction, and are launched from hand or a \\"dolly\\". Navy carrier models have a reinforced hook to help them catch an arresting cable on a simulated carrier deck. Competitions Competitions for control line aircraft are held in various classes. These include speed, precision aerobatics (AKA stunt), team racing, combat, naval carrier, and scale. For competition the lines are tested before flight with a \\"pull test\\" that varies with the model weight and category to verify that the lines and control system (primarily the bellcrank and its attachment to the rest of the model) will withstand the line tension during flight. =Speed= A typical FAI speed model - with control lines stored on reel between flights. Very long inboard wing acts as a fairing for the control lines, greatly reducing aerodynamic drag Speed is divided up into different engine capacity classes and a Jet class (using pulse jet engines). As the name suggests, the idea is to have the model go as fast as possible. The model is timed over a number of laps, and the pilot must hold the handle controlling his model in a yoke on top of a pole in the center of the circle. This is in order to stop the pilot from assisting the model to go faster by increasing the line tension and leading the model (known as whipping). Monoline control systems are common in the US, but international classes require the use of two-line control. Speeds of the fastest models - Class D and Jet - have in the past exceeded . Current US rules limit the speeds to < by requiring the use of larger lines if is exceeded. Speed models are usually launched from a \\"dolly\\" - a cart that permits a lengthy ground roll for takeoff, but drops away in the air to reduce drag. The airplane lands on a skid or belly pan. =Precision aerobatics= Precision aerobatics consists of flying a fixed sequence of maneuvers which are judged by a panel of judges for accuracy and precision. The event was originally dubbed \\"stunt\\" and current participants refer to it that way informally. Factors such as height of the maneuver bottoms, shapes, corner radius, and other factors are considered.http://www.modelaircraft.org/files/events/CLAero.pdf The judges at large competitions are typically trained for several days on how to assess the maneuvers and apply a score. Judging well is generally considered at least as difficult as flying in competition. Stunt models tend to be among the larger control line models, wings usually spanning from around . Top competition models have been traditionally powered by a two-stroke engine in the to range, with four-stroke model engines and electric power also becoming popular as power sources. The airplanes, while possessing high thrust-to-weight ratios by full-scale standards (usually at least 1:1), are intended to fly quite slowly to enhance pilot control, typically around , with a single lap of the circle taking around 5.5 seconds. Engines are commonly set to increase their power output when under load. This permits low speeds but very good speed stability, so the climb performance is excellent. The original scheme used was to take advantage of the tendency of a nominally two-stroke glow engine to change from running in a four-stroke when set with extremely rich mixtures, to running in a two-stroke when the load increases.Bair, Scott: \\"The Two-Cycle Stunt Engine\\" monograph circa 1984, published in \\"Stunt News\\" circa 2000 This is called a \\"4-2 break\\". More recently, tuned exhausts have been used to provide regulation of the speed in flight. Combined with propellers of relatively low pitch, this has permitted much more control over the engine's speed and power response to maneuvering. Electric system contain feedback control system that govern the RPM of the motor to a constant value regardless of load. Most competitive aircraft are fitted with flaps on the wings, which work in conjunction with the elevator to increase the pitch maneuverability. When up- elevator is applied, the flaps on the wings go down, and vice versa. This results in the wing, which is otherwise of a symmetrical section, to be cambered in the direction needed to enhance maneuvering. Aircraft without flaps can be flown successfully and are typically simpler, but flapped models typically fly more smoothly and can be heavier. Some of the simpler stunt models make excellent control-line trainers, as the predictable control response, low speed, and strong line tension make them easy to fly successfully. 2008 Concours d'Elegance winner - Phil Granderson's \\"Zealot\\". The model received a perfect score in appearance judging. Stunt models are often beautifully painted. Stunt rules include the appearance of the model in the score, and creating the most perfectly finished and attractive models is a competition in and of itself. A \\"Concours d'Elegance\\" award is voted on by the pilots at the Academy of Model Aeronautics' US Nationals in Muncie, Indiana for the prettiest airplane, and is very highly prized. Stunt is flown in many countries, with World Championships being held on alternate years. These are open for any flier who makes his or her respective national team. Competition at the highest levels (National or World Championships) can take many years or decades of practice to master the intricacies of designing, building, finishing, adjusting, and controlling the power of the airplanes, in addition to the high piloting skills. Many top competitive pilots have coaches. Many competitions separate pilots into 4 different skill levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert) allowing pilots to compete against other pilots of similar skill levels. =\\"Old time\\" stunt= Much like the \\"old timer\\" vintage design movement in free flight aeromodeling, several specialized classes of Stunt include \\"Old Time Stunt\\" where simpler maneuvers are performed with a model that was designed before a specific date (Pre 1953 per US rules) and \\"Classic\\" stunt which uses the current stunt \\"pattern\\" of maneuvers and airplanes designed prior to 1970. =Racing= FAI Team Race model about to be caught by pit man during pit stop practice at the 2004 World Championships in Muncie, IN. Pressurized fueling tank with pressure gauge can be seen on the pitman's left arm. Racing is an event for two-person teams‚Äîthe pilot and the pit crew. There are various racing classes of various levels of difficulty: F2C (the class flown internationally and at World Championships), Goodyear (semi-scale models of 'Goodyear era' full-size racers), Vintage classes and so on. The basic idea of all the events is that a number of models (up to three) fly together, aiming to complete a given number of laps before any of the others. The model is also required to make multiple pit stops during the race, where it is refueled, the engine restarted, and the model re- launched. This is the job of the pit crew. There are rules describing how the pilots must walk around each other, and how to pass (harder than one might think, as each model is on the end of a pair of control lines and travelling as fast as 140 mph). Pit stops require that the model be refueled and restarted - which can be a problem with a very hot racing engines. The best FAI Team Race pit stops take around 2‚Äì3 seconds for the pilot to cut the motor and land, allowing the pit-man to catch the model which only moments ago was flying at , fill the tank with 7cc of model fuel from a pressurized tank, adjust the engine mixture and compression if needed, restart, and relaunch the model. =Combat= Denmark versus Australia at the Danish Combat World Cup 2008 Mechanics launch an F2D combat model Combat is an event where to two pilots \\"dogfight\\" for cuts on their opponent's streamer. Models are fast and highly maneuverable flying-wings, which chase each other around the sky at speeds in excess of . Despite deliberate mid-airs being banned, the carnage rate is high, and pilots commonly bring 10 or more models to a competition. Combat is a highly tactical event, requiring great teamwork between a pilot and his two mechanics. F2D combat - the international class for combat - is most popular in Russia and Europe, where some countries have professional or semi-professional teams. Russia and the former Soviet countries are currently the main producers of world-class equipment for this sport, including engines. Their combination of the latest engineering and design, with exotic metallurgy and experience, results in combat engines which reliably turn 32,000 rpm, and can be restarted easily in the event of a crash. Requiring lightning-fast reflexes, combat has frequently been used as a training-ground and/or hobby for many commercial and military pilots . =Navy carrier= Navy carrier is an event where semi-scale models of real naval aircraft are flown. The event replicates the requirements of full-scale carrier aircraft, which need high speed for combat performance, and low speeds and toughness for safe carrier landings. Takeoff and landing are from a simulated aircraft carrier deck, with arrestor wires. The aim of the flight is to complete a number of fast laps, flown as quickly as possible, followed by a number of slow laps, flown as slowly as possible. This is followed by the carrier deck landing, attempting to snag the arrestor wire. The score depends on the difference of the high and low speed, and the arrested landing. Carrier models usually have a third control line, worked by a finger trigger in the handle. This line allows the throttle setting of the engine to be controlled and the arrestor hook to be dropped. Often, a carrier model will have flaps. Unlike a stunt model, however these flaps are worked separately from the elevator. A large amount of flap is usually applied during the slow laps, and a large amount of line sweep is added to yaw the model out of the circle to maintain line tension at the very low ground speeds. Low speeds are frequently no faster than a fast walk, and when aimed into a light breeze forward motion may stop completely with the model hanging at a very high angle of attack from the propeller. =Scale= Scale is an event where an accurate scale model of a real aircraft is flown. Scoring is based on static judging of how closely the aircraft resembles the full-size prototype and on the flight performance. Extra points are often awarded for \\"working\\" features of the model, such as a retractable landing gear, droppable bombs, and other functions or operations. The number of features used to be limited by the number of lines that could be practically used to mechanically control them. Some complex scale models use a fly-by-wire approach to allow a multitude of extra working features. A radio-control transmitter's encoder unit can be adapted, with no RF signal board present, to send its control signals along insulated control lines, instead of broadcasting them using radio frequencies. If signals are sent down the lines, the normal serial multiplexing of the control signals by such an adapted RC transmitter's encoder unit, solely sending those signals along the usual duo or trio of control lines, gets picked up by decoding gear in the model - usually adapted from an RC receiver, without an RF \\"front end\\" section - and permits many functions to be controlled without the use of additional lines. Standard servos can then be used in the model. From 2013, in the USA, the radio control \\"over the airwaves\\" of any moveable feature of control-line Scale or Carrier models (except the elevator) is permitted - this may spread to Europe and beyond in time. Safety Control-line flying is generally quite safe when all prescribed safety measures are followed. The airplane is constrained to fly in a circle, which is generally marked. A pilots' circle is also provided, so as long as the pilot stays in the pilot's circle and everyone else is outside the outer circle, the flying model can hit no one. In most competition categories, a \\"safety thong\\" connecting the control handle to the pilot's wrist is also required, so if the pilot inadvertently releases the handle, the airplane cannot fly outside the circle (and, frequently crashes, safely for others if not the airplane, when control is lost). The lines, handle, and control system are subjected to a \\"pull test\\" before flight to ensure that they are in good shape with some significant margin. For example, the pull test is around for a Stunt model (a 10G load), and the in-flight pull is around . This provides a 2x margin of safety even if one line should fail. One failed line immediately moves the elevator to the extreme of its movement, which almost always results in a crash, safely in the circle. Other categories of model are tested in a similar way, with the loads set to correspond to the expected speeds with a safety margin around a factor of 4. Combat models, albeit very rarely, may have their lines cut or otherwise broken by the other airplane, and can fly outside the circle. Most combat competition today requires that the airplane be equipped with a device that shuts off fuel to the engine if the lines are cut.\\"FAI Sporting Code\\", Section 4.45, Pages 40-41, Federation Aeronautique Internationale, January 1, 2009 This can work by either using the centripetal acceleration to keep the shutoff from pinching the line, or by using the line tension to hold the pinch-off device open. This way, the engine is not running and tends to decelerate very quickly instead of accelerating quickly as it would otherwise (since the drag of the lines is removed). This technique has proved to be very effective in practice. Many combat events also require the engine to be attached to the bellcrank with a cable, so that a mid-air collision will not result in the engine flying off and into the spectators. Competitors in some forms of combat competition are also required to wear helmets. Another potential safety issue is overhead power lines. Contact with power lines, or approaching high-tension power lines, is potentially fatal and must be avoided. The use of non-metallic lines may reduce the risk of electrocution, but still a margin of 150 from the plane to power lines, is mandated in the AMA safety code. Sometimes models with landing gear are flown by using a \\"stooge\\" that holds the airplane until released by the pilot from the center, usually with a spring-loaded pin pulled with a string. This allows a pilot to practice with no helper, and is common with stunt fliers trying to practice extensively. This has the potential to be dangerous if the pilot fails to properly reset the stooge, the wire connecting the stooge to the airplane (usually attached to the tail wheel) breaks, the stooge moves under the thrust/vibration of the engines, or the pilot's feet get tangled in the stooge release line. The other safety issues are common with other powered model categories. Hand-starting very powerful engines, with very sharp propellers, can be quite hazardous. An electric starter can be used, but can have negative effects on the engines due to engines not being designed to take that kind of force pushing the crank shaft back. One such method is the \\"back-bump\\" method, where the engine is choked and flipped through with no battery attached to create favorable starting conditions. Once prepared, all that is necessary is to rock the engine backwards so that it coasts up to compression, and if done correctly, starts forwards. This provides time to move the hand out of the way and the fingers are not in contact with the propeller or spinner when the engine starts. Care must be taken even choking the engine as modern engines with their accurate piston/cylinder fit can \\"bump\\" or even start without the battery attached. Once the propeller is rotating, extreme care must be taken when preparing for flight and adjusting the engine. A starting accident frequently results in a small cut to the finger, but once the engine is at full speed any injury that is encountered is likely to be quite severe. Pulse jet engines get extremely hot once started, and use very volatile fuels like gasoline or methyl-ethyl- ketone (as contrasted to relatively benign, although flammable, glow engine fuel). Contact of any type with the tailpipe of the engine is certain to result in severe burns, as the engine reaches red-hot temperatures in seconds. The airplane itself needs some sort of insulation to prevent catching fire on the ground before forward motion provides cooling air, and fully enclosed engines can set the airplane on fire after landing. The airplane should be launched as soon as possible after the engine starts to prevent heat buildup.http://www.beck-technologies.com/enginedynajet.html The spark unit used for starting can also deliver a substantial electrical shock. A fire extinguisher should be at hand at all times when operating the engine. The engine is exceptionally loud when operating and should be operated with hearing protection to prevent damage.

This involves differentiating it from competitors' products as well as a firm's own products. The concept was proposed by Edward Chamberlin in his 1933 The Theory of Monopolistic Competition. Rationale competition has driven each brand to differentiate its own product from the others to encourage consumer preference. Firms have different resource endowments that enable them to construct specific competitive advantages over competitors. Resource endowments allow firms to be different which reduces competition and makes it possible to reach new segments of the market. Thus, differentiation is the process of distinguishing the differences of a product or offering from others, to make it more attractive to a particular target market. Although research in a niche market may result in changing a product in order to improve differentiation, the changes themselves are not differentiation. Marketing or product differentiation is the process of describing the differences between products or services, or the resulting list of differences. This is done in order to demonstrate the unique aspects of a firm's product and create a sense of value. Marketing textbooks are firm on the point that any differentiation must be valued by buyers (a differentiation attempt that is not perceived does not count). The term unique selling proposition refers to advertising to communicate a product's differentiation.Reeves, Rosser (1961) The Reality of Advertising. In economics, successful product differentiation leads to competitive advantage and is inconsistent with the conditions for perfect competition, which include the requirement that the products of competing firms should be perfect substitutes. There are three types of product differentiation: # Simple: based on a variety of characteristics # Horizontal: based on a single characteristic but consumers are not clear on quality # Vertical: based on a single characteristic and consumers are clear on its quality The brand differences are mostly minor; they can be merely a difference in packaging or an advertising theme. The physical product need not change, but it may. Differentiation is due to buyers perceiving a difference; hence, causes of differentiation may be functional aspects of the product or service, how it is distributed and marketed, or who buys it. The major sources of product differentiation are as follows. *Differences in quality which are usually accompanied by differences in price *Differences in functional features or design *Ignorance of buyers regarding the essential characteristics and qualities of goods they are purchasing *Sales promotion activities of sellers and, in particular, advertising *Differences in availability (e.g. timing and location). The objective of differentiation is to develop a position that potential customers see as unique. The term is used frequently when dealing with freemium business models, in which businesses market a free and paid version of a given product. Given they target the same group of customers, it is imperative that free and paid versions be effectively differentiated. Differentiation primarily affects performance through reducing directness of competition: As the product becomes more different, categorization becomes more difficult and hence draws fewer comparisons with its competition. A successful product differentiation strategy will move your product from competing based primarily on price to competing on non-price factors (such as product characteristics, distribution strategy, or promotional variables). Most people would say that the implication of differentiation is the possibility of charging a price premium; however, this is a gross simplification. If customers value the firm's offer, they will be less sensitive to aspects of competing offers; price may not be one of these aspects. Differentiation makes customers in a given segment have a lower sensitivity to other features (non-price) of the product.  History  Edward Chamberlin‚Äôs (1933) seminal work on monopolistic competition mentioned the theory of differentiation that says that for the available products within the same industry, customers may have different preferences. However, a generic strategy of differentiation that was popularized by Michael Porter (1980) that it is any product (tangible or intangible) perceived as ‚Äúbeing unique‚Äù by At least one set of customers. Hence, it depends on their perception the extent of product differentiation. Even until 1999, the consequences of these concepts were not well understood. In fact, Miller (1986) proposed marketing and innovation as two differentiation strategies, which was supported by some scholars like Lee and Miller (1999). Mintzberf (1988) proposed more specific but broad categories: quality, design, support, image, price, and undifferentiated products, which got support from Kotha and Vadlamani (1995). However, IO literature (Ethiraj & Zhu, 2008; Makadok, 2010, 2011) did deeper analysis into the theory and explored a clear distinction between the wide use of vertical and horizontal differentiation.  Vertical Product Differentiation  If both A and B products are charged the same price to the consumer, then the market share for each one will be positive, according to the Hotelling model. The major theory in this all consumers prefer the higher quality product if two distinct products are offered at the same price. A product can differ in many vertical attributes such as its operating speed. What really matters is the relationship between consumers willingness to pay for improvements in quality and the increase in cost per unit that comes with such improvements. Therefore, the perceived difference in quality is different with different consumer, so it is objective. A green product might be having a lower or zero negative effect on the environment, however, it may turn out to be inferior than other products in other aspects. Hence, it also depends on the way it is advertised and the social pressure a potential consumer is living in. Even one vertical differentiation can be a decisive factor in purchasing.  Horizontal Product Differentiation  When products can't be ordered in an objective way and are different in one or all of its features, then there is horizontal differentiation. For example, different color versions of the same iPhone or MacBook. A lemon ice-cream is not superior to a chocolate ice-cream, is completely based on the user's preference. A restaurant may price all of its desserts at the same price and lets the consumer freely choose its preferences since all the alternatives cost the same.  Substitute Goods and Product Differentiation  According to a research conducted by combining mathematics and economics, decisions of pricing depends on the substitutability between the products depends to the degree of how much differentiated the firms‚Äô products are. No firm can charge a higher price if the products are good substitutes and vice versa. The lower non-cooperative equilibrium price the lower the differentiation. For this reason, firms might jointly raise prices above the equilibrium or competitive level by coordination between themselves. They have a verbal or written collusion agreement between them. Firms operating in a market of low product differentiation might not coordinate with others, which increases the incentive to cheat the collusion agreement. On the contrast, even by slightly lowering the prices, a firm can capture large fraction of the market and obtain short term profits with highly substitutable products.  Interaction between Horizontal and Vertical Differentiation: An Application to Banking  During the 1990s, steps taken by government on deregulation and European integration persuaded banks to compete for deposits on many factors like deposit rates, accessibility and the quality of financial services. In this example using the Hotelling model, one feature is of variety (location) and one feature of quality (remote access). Remote access using bank services via postal and telephonic services like arranging payment facilities and obtaining account information). In this model, banks cannot become vertically differentiated without negatively affecting horizontal differentiation between them. Horizontal differentiation occurs with the location of bank's branch. Vertical differentiation, in this example, occurs whenever one bank offers remote access and the other does not. With remote access, it can spur a negative interaction between transportation rate and taste for quality: customers who have higher taste for remote access face a lower transportation rate. A depositor with a high (low) taste for remote access has low (high) linear transportation costs. Different equilibria emerge as the result of two effects. On the one hand, introducing remote access steals depositors from your competitor because the product specification becomes more appealing (direct effect). On the other hand, banks become closer substitutes (indirect effect). First, banks become closer substitutes as the impact of linear transportation costs decreases. Second, deposit rate competition is affected by the size of the quality difference. These two effects, \\"stealing\\" depositors versus \\"substitutability\\" between banks, determines the equilibrium. For low and high values of the ratio quality difference to transportation rate, only one bank offers remote access (specialization). Intermediate (very low) values of the ratio quality difference to transportation costs yield universal (no) remote access. This competition is a two factor game: one is of offering of remote access and the other is of deposit rates. Hypothetically, there will be two consequential scenarios if only one bank offers remote access. First, the bank gains a positive market share for all types of remote access, giving rise to horizontal dominance. This occurs when the transportation cost prevail over the quality of service, deposit rate and time. Second, vertical dominance comes into picture when the bank that is not offering remote access gets the entire market for depositors who have lowest preference for remote access. That is when the quality service, deposit rate and time prevails over the cost of transportation.

He is best known as the inventor of the Fw 61, the first successful German helicopter. Biography =Early life= Henrich Focke was born in Bremen on 8 October 1890, Focke studied at Leibniz University Hannover, where he became friends with Georg Wulf in 1911. In 1914, he and Wulf both reported for military service and Focke was deferred due to heart problems, but was eventually drafted into an infantry regiment. After serving on the Eastern front, he was transferred to the Imperial German Army Air Service. Focke graduated in 1920 as Dipl-Ing with distinction. His first job was with the Francke Company of Bremen as a designer of water-gas systems. =Focke-Wulf and Focke-Achgelis= Henrich Focke with Hitler In 1923, with Wulf and Dr. Werner Naumann, Focke co-founded Focke-Wulf-Flugzeugbau GmbH. In 1927 Wulf died while test flying the Focke-Wulf F 19 canard monoplane. In 1930 Focke was offered a chair at the Danzig Institute of Technology, an honour which he declined. In 1931 the city of Bremen awarded him the title of Professor. The same year, Focke-Wulf was merged with the Albatros Flugzeugwerke company. Focke-Wulf constructed Juan de la Cierva's C.19 and C.30 autogyros under license from 1933, and Focke was inspired by it to design the world's first practical helicopter, the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, which first flew on 26 June 1936 by Hanna Reitsch. In the Deutschlandhalle arena in 1938, it also became the first practical helicopter to be flown indoors. In 1936 Focke was ousted from the Focke-Wulf company by shareholder pressure. Though the ostensible reason was that he was considered \\"politically unreliable\\" by the Nazi regime, there is reason to believe it was so that Focke-Wulf's manufacturing capacity could be used to produce Bf 109 aircraft. The company was taken over by AEG, but soon after this the Air Ministry, which had been impressed by the Fw 61 helicopter, suggested that Focke establish a new company dedicated to helicopter development and issued him with a requirement for an improved design capable of carrying a payload. Focke established the Focke-Achgelis company on 27 April 1937 in partnership with pilot Gerd Achgelis, and began development work at Delmenhorst in 1938. The new company built the experimental Fa 225 using the fuselage of a DFS 230 glider and a rotor from a Fa 223. Another project was the Fa 330 kite with rotor, capable of being deployed by a submarine at a moments notice and then used as a towed spotter. It was stored in a watertight container on the deck of the U-boat and was used during the war. A powered version of the kite would have been the Fa 336 which was in the design phase when the war ended and built in France postwar for testing. Focke subsequently manufactured the heavy-lift transport helicopter Fa 223, and designed the Fa 224, Fa 266, Fa 269, Fa 283, Fa 284, and the Fa 336 during World War II. Only a few of the large Fa 223 Drache (\\"Dragon\\") helicopters actually were produced, but even the prototype set a new helicopter speed record of 182 km/h (113 mph) and climb record of 8.8 m/s (1,732 ft/min) in 1940. Subsequent war models were primarily used as mountain troop transport, rescue, and crashed aircraft recovery. The helicopter had provision for a nose-mounted machine gun, and could carry one or two bombs, but the Drache was never used for combat. Towards the end of the Third Reich Focke started design work on the Focke Rochen, also known as Schnellflugzeug. =Postwar= On 1 September 1945, Focke signed a contract with the French company SNCASE and assisted in development of their SE-3000 passenger helicopter, which was based on the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 \\"Drache\\" and which first flew in 1948. In 1950, he worked as a designer with the North German Automobile Company (Norddeutsche Fahrzeugwerke) of Wilhelmshaven. In 1952, Focke and other members of his former design team were employed by Brazil's Centro T√©cnico Aeroespacial (CTA), at the time the air force's technical center, to develop a Convertiplane, the \\"Convertiplano\\", which drew heavily on Focke's wartime work on the Fa 269. Also recruited was Bussmann, a transmission specialist formerly of BMW. The Convertiplano was built using the fuselage and wings of a Supermarine Spitfire Mk 15, which was believed to be one delivered to Argentina as a sales example. Britain refused to supply the Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba engine originally selected and the design was altered to accept a mid-mounted 2200 hp Wright engine instead as used in the Lockheed Constellation, which necessitated a redesign of the transmission due to the increase in weight and vibration. Some 40 workers and US$8 million were devoted to the project, and more than 300 takeoffs were achieved. While working at the CTA Focke also developed the BF-1 Beija-Flor (hummingbird) two- seater light helicopter from 1954, which made its first flight at Sao Jose dos Campos on 22 January 1959. The BF-1 was similar in design to the Cessna CH-1, with a 225 hp Continental E225 engine in the nose and the rotor mast running vertically between the front seats. An open structure tubular steel tail boom carried a pair of tail surfaces and a small tail rotor. The BF-2 was developed from this and first flew on 1 January 1959, and performed an extended flight- testing campaign until it was damaged in an accident. It is thought that further work on the Beija Flor was then abandoned. Focke returned permanently to Germany in 1956 and began developing a three-seater helicopter named the \\"Kolibri\\" (\\"hummingbird\\") at the Borgward company in Bremen, with its first flight taking place in 1958. While working at Borgward Focke set up a wind tunnel in a disused hangar in central Bremen; this wind tunnel was rediscovered in 1997 and is today the centerpiece of a museum devoted to him. After Borgward collapsed in 1961, Focke became a consulting engineer with Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke of Bremen and Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Luft-und Raumfahrt. Focke was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for \\"outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering\\" in 1961. Focke died in Bremen on 25 February 1979. In 1993, Focke was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

Established in 1933 as an offshoot of Blohm & Voss shipbuilders, it later became an operating division within its parent company and was known as Abteilung Flugzeugbau der Schiffswerft Blohm & Voss from 1937 until it ceased operation at the end of World War II. In the postwar period it was revived as an independent company under its original name and subsequently joined several consortia before being merged to form MBB. It participates in the present day Airbus and European aerospace programs. History In 1933 the Blohm & Voss shipbuilding company in Hamburg was suffering a financial crisis from lack of work. Its owners, brothers Rudolf and Walther Blohm, decided to diversify into aircraft manufacture, believing that there would soon be a market for all-metal, long- range flying boats, especially with the German state airline Deutsche Luft Hansa. They also felt that their experience with all-metal marine construction would prove an advantage. It was at that time commonly believed that transatlantic air transport would soon take over the role filled by the luxury liners of that time. It was also thought that those planes would be seaplanes and flying boats as they could use the infrastructure and capacity of the seaports already in place, while land facilities at that time were unsuited to such large aeroplanes.Amtmann, \\"Remembered\\" (1998) Pt.1.Pohlmann (1979). =Early years= In June 1933 the Blohm brothers appointed their brother-in- law and fellow B&V; director Dipl-Ing Max Andreae and experienced aviator Robert Schr√∂ck to the board. Schr√∂ck recruited designer Reinhold Mewes away from Heinkel, and with four other designers, on 1 July they began work.Pohlmann (1979), 1982 edition, pages 8-11. The Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmBH officially came into being on 4 July.Bill Gunston; World Encyclopedia of Aero manufacturers, 2nd Edition, Sutton, 2005. The company offices at first occupied the top floor of the B&V; administrative headquarters in the Steinwerder quarter of Hamburg, with manufacturing carried out in the under- utilised shipbuilding works. Meanwhile an inland airfield and final assembly building for landplanes were begun a few miles away at Wenzendorf Aircraft Factory, opened in 1935.Hans Walden; Wie Geschmiert: R√ºstungsproduktion und Waffenhandel im Raum Hamburg (\\"Well Oiled: Armament Production and Arms Trading in the Hamburg Area\\"), Loeper, 1997. B+V Geschichte v. 1933-1938 (retrieved 1 May 2017) During this period the ruling Nazi party was massively increasing the interwar German re-armament program which included the complete overhaul of the aircraft industry. In particular, the Nazis wanted the technical capacities to quickly build large numbers of warplanes for the new Luftwaffe. As a result, the company took on subcontract manufacture of Junkers Ju 52 subassemblies, thus gaining valuable experience in the manufacture of all-metal aircraft. The bulk of the company's output would eventually turn out to be contract manufacturing of this kind, including many thousands of aircraft each for Dornier, Focke-Wulf, Heinkel, Junkers, and Messerschmitt. An Ha 139 being catapult-launched from a ship at sea The company's own designs were designated with the official RLM company code \\"Ha\\". The first to be built was the Ha 135. Mewes was unfamiliar with advanced techniques such as all- metal construction and designed a conventional biplane with fabric covering. The Blohm Brothers had wanted a more radically advanced approach and, unhappy with Mewes, sought the advice of the RLM. On their recommendation the company offered the job of Chief Designer to Richard Vogt, who was then occupying that same position at Kawasaki in Japan and was experienced in all-metal construction. Vogt accepted and arrived during late autumn, while the Ha 135 was still under construction. For a while the company maintained two design teams in separate offices.Amtmann, Paperclips (1988) The Ha 135 took off on its first fight on 28 April 1934. However it failed to attract any orders and Mewes and his team soon left the company. Vogt proved highly innovative and many of his designs would have unusual features, from the very first incorporating a tubular steel wing main spar which also doubled as the fuel tank. He oversaw all the remaining types, until the company's closure in 1945. In May 1934 Vogt's team was joined by Hans Amtmann, coming like Mewes from Heinkel and bringing to the team his experience of large flying boats. Amtmann made a good impression and was soon appointed Head of Preliminary Design. Other members included Richard Schubert as Head of Aerodynamics and George Haag as head of wing design. The only type to enter service during this period was the Ha 139 long-range seaplane mail carrier. Despite its size, with four engines, it was designed to be launched from a shipborne catapult to help extend its range, and was successfully operated in small numbers by Deutsche Luft Hansa. A landplane variant, the Ha 142, was also built for the airline. =Blohm & Voss adoption= An Ha 138 prototype of the BV138 The aircraft produced by Hamburger Flugzeugbau were still commonly associated with Blohm & Voss and this was causing confusion, so in September 1937 Hamburger Flugzeugbau was renamed Abteilung Flugzeugbau der Schiffswerft Blohm & Voss (\\"Aircraft Manufacturing Division of Blohm & Voss Shipbuilder\\"). The RLM changed the official aircraft type designation code to \\"BV\\". Some designs already under development as Ha types were reassigned a BV designation, for example the Ha 138 became the BV 138. In 1939, with the shipbuilding work revived and production capacity fully utilised again, B&V; moved its aircraft subsidiary, including both offices and seaplane manufacturing, to a purpose- built site on the shores of the river Elbe, at Finkenwerder.Amtmann (1998) Paperclips, Page 67. The most significant types to be produced were flying boats, mainly used by the Luftwaffe for maritime patrol and reconnaissance. Most numerous was the BV 138 Seedrache (initiated as the Ha 138), a twin-boom trimotor, while the BV 222 Wiking was much larger. Largest of all was the BV 238 prototype, the largest aircraft built by any of the Axis forces. Other notable types include the asymmetric BV 141; 20 were built, but the type did not enter full production. The intention at Finkenwerder was to manufacture B&V;'s own products there, but subcontract manufacture quickly ate up most of the space and much of the company's own production, such as the BV 138, was in turn subcontracted out to Weser Flugzeugbau. Remarkably, the Finkenwerder site would survive the Allied bombing of Hamburg during the war and would remain with the company. During the war, Vogt's workload increased so much that Hermann Pohlmann, designer of the Junkers Ju 87, was recruited to be his deputy. Other notable projects of the later part of the war included a variety of highly original bomber and fighter designs, including a series of tailless swept-wing fighters which culminated in an order for three prototypes of the jet-powered P 215 night fighter, just weeks before the war ended. =Postwar revival= The HFB 320 Hansa Jet At the end of the war, all aircraft production in Germany was shut down. Vogt and Amtmann were swept up by the American Operation Paperclip and made new careers over there. Pohlmann remained in Germany. In 1955 Germany was allowed to build civil aircraft once again. The main works at Finkenwerder was still there and Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmBH (HFB) re-emerged in 1956, still under the ownership of Walther Blohm but no longer connected to B+V. Blohm tried to tempt Vogt back from the US, but without success and Pohlmann returned to the company to become the new chief designer.Pohlmann (1979), 1982 edition, Page 242. Another significant recruit was Hans Wocke, who headed up the engineering team. As ever, the company's main work would turn out to be as subcontractor for various German ‚Äì and increasingly European ‚Äì aircraft projects, and to this end it would participate in a number of consortia. Its first contract was for fuselage manufacture and final assembly of the Nord Noratlas. Other significant work would be undertaken for the Luftwaffe's Lockheed F-104G Starfighter and as a partner in the Transall C-160 military transport.\\"The German Industry\\", section on Hamburger Flugzeugbau, Flight, 19 October 1961, Pages 619-670. In 1958 HFB proposed two civil transport projects. The HFB 209 was a twin-turpoprop capable of carrying 48 passengers, while the HFB 314 was a short-haul twin-jet. But the anticipated funding from the German government was not made available and the projects were cancelled in the early 1960s. In 1961, HFB and Focke-Wulf/Weserflug (VFW) jointly formed the Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO) to develop air and space products. Work would be carried out for the Dornier Do 31 V/STOL transport and, later, in direct collaboration on the Fokker F28 Fellowship. The only aircraft type to be both designed and built by the new HFB was the HFB 320 Hansa Jet, a business jet with forward-swept wings, which first flew in 1964 and was made in moderate numbers. In May 1969, HFB merged with Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow to form Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB), which in turn was taken over by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) in September 1989. DASA has since been absorbed into the pan-European Airbus corporation. Airbus has since built a significant presence around the original HFB team and operates the airfield privately as Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport. Aircraft and related products =Hamburger Flugzeugbau (prewar)= Some of these types were still under construction when the company name was changed to B&V; and flew only under the new name. But only those whose design and development continued under B&V; were redesignated. * Ha 135. Conventional biplane trainer prototype, designed by Reinhold Mewes. * Ha 136. All-metal monoplane trainer prototype. First to incorporate Vogt's trademark cylindrical main spar with integral fuel tank. * Ha 137. Dive bomber prototype. * Ha 138. Twin-boom flying boat prototype.

Some twelve pre-production examples saw operational service. * BV 238. Flying-boat prototype, the largest Axis aircraft design of the war years to fly. * BV 40. Glider interceptor prototype. Several examples flown but not yet operational by the end of hostilities. Of these aircraft, few entered operational service and only one, the BV 138 \\"Fliegende Holzschuh\\" (flying clog), attained serial production. All other aircraft either remained prototypes or were limited to a small number of pre-series/purpose build machines. Nevertheless, work was sufficient to require a second manufacturing plant at Finkenwerder. The largest aircraft ever designed and built by any of the Axis powers of World War II, the BV 238, resembled an enlarged BV 222, with only one prototype aircraft built and flown. Munitions developed Besides aircraft, during World War II B&V; also developed a number of air-launched munitions such as glide bombs and torpedoes. Although the company built thousands of examples during development, none entered operational service. These were: * BV 143. Glide bomb prototype. * BV 246 Hagelkorn (Hailstone), originally designated BV 226. Long-range radar-homing glide bomb prototype. * BV 950 Gliding torpedo prototype, built in two variants:Pohlmann (1979), 1982 edition, Pages 195-198.William Green; Warplanes of the Third Reich, Macdonald and Jane's, 4th Impression, 1979. ** L 10 Friedensengel. Torpedo with glider attachment. ** L 11 Schneewittchen. Later and more advanced derivative. Design projects Vogt proved a highly innovative designer and many of his projects gained interest within the German aero community. B&V; explored several main themes of interest, each through a series of design projects and proposals. These included; large maritime aircraft \\"stuka\\" dive bomber / ground attack replacements for the Junkers Ju 87, fast bombers and advanced fighters.Cowin, Hugh W.; ‚ÄúBlohm und Voss Projects of World War II‚Äù, Air Pictorial, Part I October 1963 pp. 312-316, Part II November 1963 pp. 368-370, Part III December 1963 pp. 404-406. Many studies had unusual configurations such as asymmetry, novel multi-engine layouts and crew locations, wings swept forwards or back (or both) and sometimes tailless. All these lines of study followed through into the jet age, some with piston+jet mixed-power engine combinations. Significant internal projects of the World War II era included: Transports: * P 200. Long-range passenger flying boat. * BV 250. Landplane variant of the BV 238. Bombers: * BV 237. Single-seat dive bomber and ground attack development of the asymmetric Bv 141.

It is governed under the management of the Indian Ministry of Defence. The government-owned corporation is primarily involved in the operations of the aerospace and is currently involved in the design, fabrication and assembly of aircraft, jet engines, helicopters and their spare parts. It has several facilities spread across India including Bangalore, Nasik, Korwa, Kanpur, Koraput, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Barrackpore and Kasaragod. The HAL HF-24 Marut fighter-bomber was the first fighter aircraft made in India.  History fuel tanks during World War II HAL was established as Hindustan Aircraft Limited in Bangalore on 23 December 1940 by Walchand Hirachand who became Chairman of the company. The company's office was opened at a bungalow called \\"Eventide\\" on Domlur Road. The organisation and equipment for the factory at Bangalore was set up by William D. Pawley of the Intercontinental Aircraft Corporation of New York. Pawley obtained a large number of machine-tools and equipment from the United States. The Indian Government bought a one-third stake in the company and by April 1941 by investing ‚Çπ25 lakh as it believed this to be a strategic imperative. The decision by the government was primarily motivated to boost British military hardware supplies in Asia to counter the increasing threat posed by Imperial Japan during Second World War. The Kingdom of Mysore supplied two directors, Air Marshal John Higgins was resident director. The first aircraft built was a Harlow PC-5\\"Hindustan Aircraft Ltd\\" Flight 27 August 1954 p. 296. On 2 April 1942, the government announced that the company had been nationalised when it had bought out the stakes of Seth Walchand Hirachand and other promoters so that it could act freely. The Mysore Kingdom refused to sell its stake in the company but yielded the management control over to the Indian Government. The total number of broad- gauge coaches manufactured by the Hindustan Aircraft Limited during the year 1954 is 158. In 1943 the Bangalore factory was handed over to the United States Army Air Forces but still using Hindustan Aircraft management. The factory expanded rapidly and became the centre for major overhaul and repair of American aircraft and was known as the 84th Air Depot. The first aircraft to be overhauled was a Consolidated PBY Catalina followed by every type of aircraft operated in India and Burma. When returned to Indian control two years later the factory had become one of the largest overhaul and repair organisations in the East. In the post war reorganisation the company built railway carriages as an interim activity. IJT prototype in its hangar After India gained independence in 1947, the management of the company was passed over to the Government of India. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was formed on 1 October 1964 when Hindustan Aircraft Limited joined the consortium formed in June by the IAF Aircraft Manufacturing Depot, Kanpur (at the time manufacturing HS748 under licence) and the group recently set up to manufacture MiG-21 under licence, with its new factories planned in Koraput, Nasik and Hyderabad.HAL Preserved Flight International 1964 Though HAL was not used actively for developing newer models of fighter jets, except for the HF-24 Marut, the company has played a crucial role in modernisation of the Indian Air Force. In 1957 company started manufacturing Bristol Siddeley Orpheus jet engines under licence at new factory located in Bangalore. Production line of the HAL Dhruv at Bangalore During the 1980s, HAL's operations saw a rapid increase which resulted in the development of new indigenous aircraft such as the HAL Tejas and HAL Dhruv. HAL also developed an advanced version of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, known as MiG-21 Bison, which increased its life-span by more than 20 years. HAL has also obtained several multimillion-dollar contracts from leading international aerospace firms such as Airbus, Boeing and Honeywell to manufacture aircraft spare parts and engines. By 2012, HAL was reportedly bogged down in the details of production and has been slipping on its schedules.\\"HAL slipping up on deliveries as it handles too many projects.\\" The Hindu Business Line, 3 March 2012. On 1 April 2015, HAL reconstituted its Board with TS Raju as CMD, S Subrahmanyan as Director (Operations), VM Chamola as Director (HR), CA Ramana Rao as Director (Finance) and D K Venkatesh as Director (Engineering & R&D;). There are two government nominees in the board and six independent directors. In March 2017, HAL Chairman and Managing Director T Suvarna Raju announced that the company had finalised plans for an indigenisation drive. The company plans to produce nearly 1, 000 military helicopters, including Kamov 226, LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter), and over 100 planes over the next 10 years. HAL will manufacture the Kamov 226T helicopter under a joint venture agreement with Russian defence manufacturers. The Kamov 226T will replace the country's fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. Over the next 5 years, HAL will carry out major upgrade of almost the entire fighter fleet of Indian Air Force including Su-30MKI, Jaguars, Mirage and Hawk jets to make them \\"more lethal\\". The company will also deliver 123 Tejas Light Combat Aircraft to the IAF from 2018‚Äì19, at a rate of 16 jets per year. LCH production will now take place in a newly built Light Combat Helicopter Production Hangar at Helicopter Division in HAL Complex. In view of Make in India policy and to increase the share of defence exports to achieve the target of $5 billion dollars by 2025, HAL is planning to setup logistic bases in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam with priority target for Southeast Asia, West Asia and North African markets. It would not only help to promote HAL products but also act as service centre for Soviet/Russian origin equipment. Operations One of the largest aerospace companies in Asia, HAL has annual turnover of over 2 billion. More than 40% of HAL's revenues come from international deals to manufacture aircraft engines, spare parts, and other aircraft materials. A partial list of major operations undertaken by HAL includes the following: =International agreements= HAL Dhruv helicopters of the Ecuadorian Air Force in 2009 Aero India IAF BAe Hawk being licence-produced at the HAL Hawk production facility in Bangalore * The US$35 billion fifth-generation fighter jet programme with the Sukhoi Corporation of Russia. * US$1 billion contract to manufacture aircraft parts for Boeing.Boeing to export up to $1 billion in work to India TheNewsTribune.com Tacoma, WA * Multi-role transport aircraft project with Ilyushin of Russia worth US$600 million. * 120 RD-33MK turbofan engines to be manufactured for MiG-29K by HAL for US$250 million. * Contract to manufacture 1, 000 TPE331 aircraft engines for Honeywell worth US$200, 000 each (estimates put total value of deal at US$200 million). * US$120 million deal to manufacture Dornier 228 for RUAG of Switzerland. * Manufacture of aircraft parts for Airbus SAS worth US$150 million. * US$100 million contract to export composite materials to Israel Aircraft Industries. * US$65 million joint-research facility with Honeywell and planned production of Garrett TPE331 engines. * US$50.7 million contract to supply Advanced Light Helicopter to Ecuadorian Air Force.

Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid, either serum or plasma. However, blisters can be filled with blood (known as \\"blood blisters\\") or with pus (for instance, if they become infected). The word \\"blister\\" entered English in the 14th century. It came from the Middle Dutch \\"bluyster\\" and was a modification of the Old French \\"blostre\\", which meant a leprous nodule‚Äîa rise in the skin due to leprosy. In dermatology today, the words vesicle and bulla refer to blisters of smaller or greater size, respectively. To heal properly, a blister should not be popped unless medically necessary. If popped, the excess skin should not be removed because the skin underneath needs the top layer to heal properly. Causes A blister may form when the skin has been damaged by friction or rubbing, heat, cold or chemical exposure. Fluid collects between the upper layers of skin (the epidermis) and the layers below (the dermis). This fluid cushions the tissue underneath, protecting it from further damage and allowing it to heal. =Friction or rubbing= Various sized blisters on the sole of a foot due to friction Intense rubbing can cause a blister, as can any friction on the skin if continued long enough. This kind of blister is most common after walking long distances or by wearing old or poorly fitting shoes.[Naylor PFD. \\"The Skin Surface and Friction,\\" British Journal of Dermatology. 1955;67:239‚Äì248.][Naylor PFD. \\"Experimental Friction Blisters,\\" British Journal of Dermatology. 1955;67:327‚Äì342.][Sulzberger MB, Cortese TA, Fishman L, Wiley HS. \\"Studies on Blisters Produced by Friction,\\" Journal of Investigative Dermatology. 1966;47:456‚Äì465.] Blisters are most common on the hands and feet, as these extremities are susceptible while walking, running, or performing repetitive motions, such as joystick manipulation whilst playing certain video games, digging with a shovel, playing guitar or bass, etc. Blisters form more easily on damp skin than on dry or soaked skin,[Carlson JM. \\"The Friction Factor,\\" OrthoKinetic Review. Nov/Dec 2001;1(7):1‚Äì3.] and are more common in warm conditions. Less-aggressive rubbing over long periods of time may cause calluses to form rather than a blister. Both blisters and calluses can lead to more serious complications, such as foot ulceration and infection, particularly when sensation or circulation is impaired, as in the case of diabetes, neuropathy or peripheral artery disease (PAD). =Extreme temperature= burning. This type of blistering is one of the tools used to determine the degree of burns sustained. First and second degree burns may result in blistered skin; however, it is characteristic of second degree burns to blister immediately, whereas first degree burns can have blisters after a couple of days. Blisters can also form on the hands and feet as a result of tissue damage incurred by frostbite. =Chemical exposure= Blisters caused by exposure to sulfur mustard agent. Sometimes, the skin will blister when it comes into contact with a cosmetic, detergent, solvent, or other chemical such as nickel sulfate, Balsam of Peru, or urushiol (poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac). This is known as contact dermatitis. Blisters can also develop as a result of an allergic reaction to an insect bite or sting. Some chemical warfare agents, known as blister agents or vesicants, cause large, painful blisters wherever they contact skin; an example is mustard gas. =Crushing/pinching= A blood blister usually forms when a minute blood vessel close to the surface of the skin ruptures (breaks), and blood leaks into a tear between the layers of skin. This can happen if the skin is crushed, pinched or aggressively squeezed. =Medical conditions= There are also a number of medical conditions that cause blisters. The most common are chickenpox, herpes, impetigo, and a form of eczema called dyshidrosis. Other, much rarer conditions that cause blisters include: * Bullous pemphigoid: a skin disease that causes large, tightly filled blisters to develop, usually affecting people over the age of 60. * Pemphigus: a serious skin disease in which blisters develop if pressure is applied to the skin; the blisters burst easily, leaving raw areas that can become infected. * Dermatitis herpetiformis: a skin disease that causes intensely itchy blisters, usually on the elbows, knees, back and buttocks. The blisters usually develop in patches of the same shape and size on both sides of the body. * Chronic bullous dermatosis: a disease that causes clusters of blisters on the face, mouth or genitals. * Cutaneous radiation syndrome * Epidermolysis bullosa Pathophysiology =Friction blisters= Friction blisters are caused by excess shear stress between the bottom and surface of the skin and the body. The strata of skin around the stratum spinosum are most susceptible to shear. As the stratum spinosum tears away from the connecting tissues below, plasma from the cells diffuses out. This plasma solution helps new cells divide and grow into new connective tissues and epidermal layers. The clear fluid will be reabsorbed as new cells develop and the swollen appearance will subside. Painful blisters located on hands (palmar surface) and feet (plantar surface) are due to tissue shearing deeper in the epidermis, near nerve endings. Lower tissues are more susceptible to infection. Prevention =Friction blisters= Friction blisters, caused by rubbing against the skin, can be prevented by reducing the friction to a level where blisters will not form.[Hanna T, Carlson JM. \\"Freedom from Friction,\\" OrthoKinetic Review. Mar/Apr 2004;4(2):34‚Äì35.] This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Blisters on the feet can be prevented by wearing comfortable, well-fitting shoes and clean socks. Inherently ill-fitting or stiffer shoes, such as high heels and dress shoes, present a larger risk of blistering. Blisters are more likely to develop on skin that is moist, so socks that manage moisture or frequent sock changes will aid those with particularly sweaty feet. While exercising or playing sports, special sports socks can help keep feet drier and reduce the chance of blisters. Before going for a long walk, it is also important to ensure that shoes or hiking boots have been properly broken in. Even before a \\"hot\\" or irritated area on the foot is felt, taping a protective layer of padding or a friction-reducing interface between the affected area and the footwear can prevent the formation of a blister. Bandages, moleskin and tapes generally must be applied to the foot daily, and most have a very high coefficient of friction (COF), but a friction-management patch applied to the shoe will remain in place much longer, throughout many changes of socks and insoles. This type of intervention may be used with footwear that is worn daily, with specialty shoes and boots like hockey skates, ice skates, inline skates, ski boots and cleats, or even with orthotic braces and splints. For periods of sustained use such as hiking and trail running, especially where water ingress or moisture build up in the shoe or boot can occur, moisture wicking liner socks can provide the required friction protection. To avoid friction blisters on the hands, gloves should be worn when using tools such as a shovel or pickaxe, doing manual work such as gardening, or using sports equipment like golf clubs or baseball bats. Oars used for competitive rowing are known for causing frequent blisters on the hands of oarsmen. Weightlifters are also prone to blisters as are gymnasts from the friction developed by the rubbing against the bars. To further reduce the occurrence one can tape the hands, and there are also a number of products on the market that claim to reduce the occurrence of blisters. These are all intended to be worn as a liner underneath a glove. The majority of these offerings simply add padding and create a layer that reduces the coefficient of friction between the skin and the glove. A lubricant, typically talcum powder, can be used to reduce friction between skin and apparel in the short term. People put talcum powder inside gloves or shoes for this purpose, although this type of lubricant will increase the friction in the long term, as it absorbs moisture. Increased friction makes blisters more likely. =Other= Sunscreen and protective clothing should also be used during the hottest part of the day to avoid blisters from sunburn. Avoiding sunlight during midday is the best way to avoid blisters from sunburn. Protective gloves should be worn when handling detergents, cleaning products, solvents and other chemicals.

Early life Pickens was born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Scots-Irish immigrants, Andrew Pickens Sr. and Anne (n√©e Davis). His paternal great-grandparents were Huguenots Robert Andrew Pickens (Robert Andr√© Picon) and Esther-Jeanne, widow Bonneau, of South Carolina and La Rochelle, France.wc.rootsweb.com His family traveled the Great Wagon Road in hopes of finding a new home. Records show they first settled in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and later in 1752, his family moved to the Waxhaws on the South Carolina frontier. He sold his farm there in 1764 and bought land in Abbeville County, South Carolina, near the Georgia border. It was there that he married and began a family. In addition to raising cattle and farming, like most other Scots-Irish immigrants, he became acquainted with his Native American neighbors and built a blockhouse as a base for training. He established the Hopewell Plantation on the Seneca River, at which several treaties with Native Americans were held, each called the Treaty of Hopewell. Just across the river was the Cherokee town of Isunigu (\\"Seneca\\"). A religious man himself, Pickens was also known as the \\"Fighting Elder\\" because of his strong Presbyterian faith. Old Stone Church cemetery Military career He served in the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1760‚Äì1761. When the Revolutionary War started, he sided with the rebel militia and was made a captain. He rose to the rank of Brigadier General in the South Carolina militia during the war. He emerged as a military leader in Long Cane, fighting against the Cherokee who had allied with the Loyalists. In the year 1779 Henry Clinton deployed British soldiers to both South Carolina and North Carolina to encourage Loyalist support. On February 14, 1779, Colonel Pickens and his 300-man militia overtook the larger British force of 700‚Äì800 men under Colonel Boyd at Kettle at the Battle of Kettle Creek in Wilkes County, Georgia, just south of the Long Canes. The victory at Kettle Creek slowed the recruitment of the Loyalists. However, when the British defeated the Southern Continental Army in 1780 in the Siege of Charleston, Pickens surrendered a fort in the Ninety-Six District and he, along with his 300 militia men, on oath, agreed to sit out of the war. Pickens' parole did not last, however. After Tory raiders destroyed most of his property and frightened his family, he informed the British that they had violated the terms of parole, and he rejoined the war. During this period of the war, Pickens joined Francis Marion and Thomas Sumter as the most well-known partisan leaders in the Carolinas. Sumter also resumed fighting under similar circumstances. He saw action at the Battle of Cowpens, Siege of Augusta, Siege of Ninety-Six, and the Battle of Eutaw Springs. Pickens also led a campaign in north Georgia against the Cherokee Indians late in the war. His victorious campaign led to the Cherokees ceding significant portions of land between the Savannah and Chattahoochee rivers in the Long Swamp Treaty signed in what is currently Pickens County, Georgia. Pickens led a detached militia of 25 men to battle against a Cherokee force of an estimated 150 men in what came to be called the \\"Ring Fight.\\" Pickens gained the respect of these Natives, and after the war was well-regarded by Native Americans that he dealt with; he was given the name Skyagunsta, \\"The Wizard Owl,\\" which is reportedly a name based on a well-regarded previous Chief of the tribe. *Cowpens, South Carolina: Jan. 17, 1781: :At the Battle of Cowpens, Brig. General Daniel Morgan gave Pickens command of the militia, which played a pivotal role in the battle. On the evening of January 16, Morgan personally instructed the militia to hold its ground and then retreat. On the morning of January 17, Pickens and the militia carried out the plan perfectly. The militia fired two rounds before retreating, something not done in previous battles and untypical of a militia. After the second round, they led Lt. Colonel Banastre Tarleton and the British to blindly charge drawing them into a double envelopment where they were soundly defeated. This battle proved to be a turning point in the war in the South, and following Cowpens, South Carolina Governor John Rutledge promoted Pickens to brigadier general. He was also awarded a sword by Congress. *February to March 1781: :Pickens was \\"elected\\" to lead the Salisbury District Brigade of North Carolina militia. After the death of Brig. Gen. (Pro Tempore) William Lee Davidson on February 1, 1781, the colonels of the Salisbury District \\"elected\\" Pickens to lead them since he was a recently appointed brigadier general in South Carolina with no men to lead. He was active in February and very early March only. *Augusta, Georgia: May 22‚ÄìJune 5, 1781: :Pickens' militia was soon recalled to defend their own homes and so he missed the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on March 15, 1781. In April, he raised a regiment of state regulars. In May 1781, Maj. General Nathanael Greene sent Pickens and Lt. Colonel Henry Lee to support Elijah Clarke in operations against Augusta, Georgia. The siege began on May 22 and after maneuvering, securing outposts and the cutting off of reinforcements by the Patriots, Colonel Thomas Brown surrendered Augusta on June 5, 1781. *Ninety Six, South Carolina: May 22‚ÄìJune 19, 1781: :Following the surrender of Augusta, Pickens and Lt. Colonel Lee joined General Greene in his siege at Ninety Six, South Carolina. Greene had begun his siege on May 22, 1781, the same day that Augusta had been besieged. On June 11, Greene ordered Pickens and Lt. Colonel William Washington to aid Thomas Sumter in blocking a relief column led by Lord Rawdon. However, Sumter instead moved to Fort Granby, allowing Rawdon to make his way to Ninety Six. On June 19, Greene had to give up the siege and retreat after a failed assault. *Eutaw Springs, Charleston, South Carolina: September 8, 1781: : Under the command of General Nathanael Greene, Pickens led his militia in one of the final major battles in the South. With the aid of Henry Lee and Francis Marion, the Patriots fought the British at the Battle of Eutaw Springs. Although more Patriots died than Loyalists and British, the efforts made by the Patriots forced the British to lose control of the South for the rest of the war. Political career At the end of the war, Pickens was elected to public office in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1781 to 1794. In addition, he was a South Carolina delegate to the Constitutional Convention. Pickens was later elected to the Third Congress, served from 1793 to 1795 as an Anti-Administration member, opposing the policies of US Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Family Pickens married Rebecca Floride Calhoun in 1765. They had 12 children, Mary Pickens (1766‚Äì1836); Lt. Gov. Ezekiel Pickens (1768‚Äì1813), Ann Pickens (1770‚Äì1846), son (1772), Jane Pickens (1773‚Äì1816); Margaret Pickens (1777‚Äì1830); Gov. Andrew Pickens, Jr. (1779‚Äì1838), son (1782); Rebecca Pickens (1784‚Äì1831); Catherine Pickens (1786‚Äì1871) and Joseph Pickens (1791‚Äì1853). Andrew Pickens, Jr. became governor of South Carolina in 1817‚Äì1819, and Ezekiel Pickens became a lieutenant governor of South Carolina from 1802 to 1804. A grandson was Francis Wilkinson Pickens who was also a governor of South Carolina from 1860 to 1862. Pickens died near Tamassee, South Carolina, in Oconee County, on August 11, 1817. He is buried at Old Stone Church Cemetery in Clemson, South Carolina. Pickens is also the uncle (through his marriage to Rebecca Florida Calhoun) to John C. Calhoun (1782‚Äì1850), who was a leading American politician and political theorist during the first half of the 19th century and hailed from South Carolina. John C. Calhoun's home, Fort Hill, can be found on the campus of Clemson University within Pickens County, South Carolina. It is a famous historic landmark in the state of South Carolina. Memorials Fort Pickens in Florida is named in his honor as is Pickens County, Alabama; Pickens County, Georgia; and the city of Pickens and Pickens County in his adopted home state of South Carolina. Pickens was a 7th great-grandfather of former senator and 2004 presidential candidate John Edwards. His Hopewell plantation is now owned and maintained by Clemson University. Hopewell, Clemson (Pickens County, South Carolina) He is also the namesake of Pickens High School. The Patriot Pickens and his actions served as one of the sources for the fictional character of Benjamin Martin in The Patriot, a motion picture released in 2000. In a scene prior to the Battle of Cowpens, Benjamin Martin (character) asks the militia for two rounds before they retreat, reminiscent of Daniel Morgan in the Battle of Cowpens.

They are endemic to the Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea region, including the Bismarck Archipelago and, marginally, in Indonesia (Seram).  Etymology  The bandicoot is a member of the order Peramelemorphia, and the word \\"bandicoot\\" is often used informally to refer to any peramelemorph, such as the bilby. The term originally referred to the unrelated Indian bandicoot rat from the Telugu word Pandikokku (‡∞™‡∞Ç‡∞¶‡∞ø‡∞ï‡±ä‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞ï‡±Å).  Characteristics  Most marsupials, including bandicoots, have a bifurcated penis. The embryos of bandicoots have a chorioallantoic placenta that connects them to the uterine wall, in addition to the choriovitelline placenta that is common to all marsupials. However, the chorioallantoic placenta is small compared to those of the Placentalia, and lacks chorionic villi. Bandicoots may serve as a primary reservoir for Coxiella burnetii. Infection is transmitted among them by ticks. These are then transmitted to domestic animals (cattle, sheep and poultry). The infected domestic animals shed them in urine, faeces, and placental products. It is transmitted to humans causing Q fever by inhalation of aerosols of these materials. Main symptoms may be pneumonia and/or hepatitis.  Classification  Classification within the Peramelemorphia used to be simple. There were thought to be two families in the order‚Äîthe short- legged and mostly herbivorous bandicoots, and the longer-legged, nearly carnivorous bilbies. In recent years, however, it has become clear that the situation is more complex. First, the bandicoots of the New Guinean and far- northern Australian rainforests were deemed distinct from all other bandicoots and were grouped together in the separate family Peroryctidae. More recently, the bandicoot families were reunited in Peramelidae, with the New Guinean species split into four genera in two subfamilies, Peroryctinae and Echymiperinae, while the \\"true bandicoots\\" occupy the subfamily Peramelidae. The only exception is the now extinct pig-footed bandicoot, which has been given its own family, Chaeropodidae. * Order Peramelemorphia **Superfamily PerameloideaStrahan, R. (1995).

In the years before World War I, he founded the scuola metafisica art movement, which profoundly influenced the surrealists. His most well-known works often feature Roman arcades, long shadows, mannequins, trains, and illogical perspective. His imagery reflects his affinity for the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and for the mythology of his birthplace. After 1919, he became a critic of modern art, studied traditional painting techniques, and worked in a neoclassical or neo-Baroque style, while frequently revisiting the metaphysical themes of his earlier work. Life and works The Song of Love, 1914, oil on canvas, 73 √ó 59.1 cm, Museum of Modern Art, New York Giuseppe Maria Alberto Giorgio de Chirico was born in Volos, Greece, as the eldest son of Gemma Cervetto and Evaristo de Chirico. His mother was Genoese-GreekNikolaos Velissiotis, \\"The Origins of Adelaide Mabili and Her Marriage to Giorgio De Chirico: Restoration of the Historical Truth\\", Metaphysical Art, 2013N¬∞ 11/13. (likely born in Smyrna) and his father a Sicilian barone from a family of remote Greek origin (the Kyriko or Chirico was a family of Greek origin that moved from Rhodes to Palermo in 1523, together with other 4000 Greek-Catholic families). De Chirico's family was in Greece at the time of his birth because his father, engineer, was in charge of the construction of a railroad. His younger brother was the writer, painter and composer Alberto Savinio. Beginning in 1900, de Chirico studied drawing and painting at Athens Polytechnic‚Äîmainly under the guidance of the Greek painters Georgios Roilos and Georgios Jakobides. After Evaristo de Chirico's death in 1905, the family relocated in 1906 to Germany, after first visiting Florence.Gale, Matthew (2003, January 01). \\"De Chirico, Giorgio\\". Grove Art Online. Ed. De Chirico entered the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, where he studied under Gabriel von Hackl and Carl von Marr and read the writings of the philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer and Otto Weininger. There, he also studied the works of Arnold B√∂cklin and Max Klinger.Holzhey, Magdalena. Giorgio de Chirico. Cologne: Taschen, 2005, p. 10. see the entry on de Chirico in \\"Propyl√§en Kunstgeschichte, Die Kunst des 20. Jahrhunderts 1880‚Äì1940\\", by Giulio Carlo Argan, 1990, p. 201, The style of his earliest paintings, such as The Dying Centaur (1909), shows the influence of B√∂cklin. =Metaphysical art= De Chirico returned to Italy in the summer of 1909 and spent six months in Milan. By 1910, he was beginning to paint in a simpler style of flat, anonymous surfaces. At the beginning of 1910, he moved to Florence where he painted the first of his 'Metaphysical Town Square' series, The Enigma of an Autumn Afternoon, after the revelation he felt in Piazza Santa Croce. He also painted The Enigma of the Oracle while in Florence. In July 1911 he spent a few days in Turin on his way to Paris. De Chirico was profoundly moved by what he called the 'metaphysical aspect' of Turin, especially the architecture of its archways and piazzas. The paintings de Chirico produced between 1909 and 1919, his metaphysical period, are characterized by haunted, brooding moods evoked by their images. At the start of this period, his subjects were motionless cityscapes inspired by the bright daylight of Mediterranean cities, but gradually he turned his attention to studies of cluttered storerooms, sometimes inhabited by mannequin-like hybrid figures. De Chirico's conception of Metaphysical art was strongly influenced by his reading of Nietzsche, whose style of writing fascinated de Chirico with its suggestions of unseen auguries beneath the appearance of things.Holzhey 2005, p. 14. De Chirico found inspiration in the unexpected sensations that familiar places or things sometimes produced in him: In a manuscript of 1909 he wrote of the \\"host of strange, unknown and solitary things that can be translated into painting ... What is required above all is a pronounced sensitivity.\\"Holzhey 2005, p. 15. Metaphysical art combined everyday reality with mythology, and evoked inexplicable moods of nostalgia, tense expectation, and estrangement.Holzhey 2005, p. 25. The picture space often featured illogical, contradictory, and drastically receding perspectives. Among de Chirico's most frequent motifs were arcades, of which he wrote: \\"The Roman arcade is fate ... its voice speaks in riddles which are filled with a peculiarly Roman poetry\\".Holzhey 2005, pp. 15‚Äì18. De Chirico moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea. Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his works: Enigma of the Oracle, Enigma of an Afternoon and Self-Portrait. During 1913 he exhibited paintings at the Salon des Ind√©pendants and Salon d‚ÄôAutomne; his work was noticed by Pablo Picasso and Guillaume Apollinaire, and he sold his first painting, The Red Tower. His time in Paris also resulted in the production of Chirico's Ariadne. In 1914, through Apollinaire, he met the art dealer Paul Guillaume, with whom he signed a contract for his artistic output.

Upon his arrival in May 1915, he enlisted in the army, but he was considered unfit for work and assigned to the hospital at Ferrara. The shop windows of that town inspired a series of paintings that feature biscuits, maps, and geometric constructions in indoor settings.Holzhey 2005, p. 46. In Ferrara he met with Carlo Carr√† and together they founded the pittura metafisica movement. He continued to paint, and in 1918, he transferred to Rome. Starting from 1918, his work was exhibited extensively in Europe. =Return to order= In November 1919, de Chirico published an article in Valori plastici entitled \\"The Return of Craftsmanship\\", in which he advocated a return to traditional methods and iconography.Metken, G. (1981). Realismus: zwischen Revolution und Reaktion, 1919‚Äì1939 : [Ausstellung im Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, 17. Dezember 1980-20. April 1981 : Ausstellung in der Staatlichen Kunsthalle, Berlin, 16. Mai-28. Juni 1981. M√ºnchen: Prestel- Verlag. pp. 83‚Äì84. . This article heralded an abrupt change in his artistic orientation, as he adopted a classicizing manner inspired by such old masters as Raphael and Signorelli, and became part of the post-war return to order in the arts. He became an outspoken opponent of modern art.Schwartz, Sanford. Artists and Writers. New York: Yarrow Press, 1990, pp. 28‚Äì29. In the early 1920s, the Surrealist writer Andr√© Breton discovered one of de Chirico's metaphysical paintings on display in Guillaume's Paris gallery, and was enthralled.Holzhey 2005, p. 62. Numerous young artists who were similarly affected by de Chirico's imagery became the core of the Paris Surrealist group centered around Breton. In 1924 de Chirico visited Paris and was accepted into the group, although the surrealists were severely critical of his post- metaphysical work.Holzhey 2005, p. 67. De Chirico met and married his first wife, the Russian ballerina Raissa Gurievich (1894-1979) in 1925, and together they moved to Paris.Holzhey 2005, p. 94. His relationship with the Surrealists grew increasingly contentious, as they publicly disparaged his new work; by 1926 he had come to regard them as \\"cretinous and hostile\\".Cowling, Elizabeth; Mundy, Jennifer. On Classic Ground: Picasso, L√©ger, de Chirico and the New Classicism, 1910‚Äì1930. London: Tate Gallery, 1990, p. 81. They soon parted ways in acrimony. In 1928 he held his first exhibition in New York City and shortly afterwards, London. He wrote essays on art and other subjects, and in 1929 published a novel entitled Hebdomeros, the Metaphysician. Also in 1929, he made stage designs for Sergei Diaghilev. De Chirico in 1970, photographed by Paolo Monti. Fondo Paolo Monti, BEIC =Later work= In 1930, de Chirico met his second wife, Isabella Pakszwer Far (1909-1990), a Russian, with whom he would remain for the rest of his life. Together they moved to Italy in 1932 and to the US in 1936, finally settling in Rome in 1944. In 1948 he bought a house near the Spanish Steps; now the Giorgio de Chirico House Museum, a museum dedicated to his work. In 1939, he adopted a neo-Baroque style influenced by Rubens. De Chirico's later paintings never received the same critical praise as did those from his metaphysical period. He resented this, as he thought his later work was better and more mature. He nevertheless produced backdated \\"self-forgeries\\" both to profit from his earlier success, and as an act of revenge‚Äîretribution for the critical preference for his early work. He also denounced many paintings attributed to him in public and private collections as forgeries.The Memoirs of Giorgio de Chirico, Perseus Books Group, 1994, In 1945, he published his memoirs. He remained extremely prolific even as he approached his 90th year.Schwartz 1990, p. 29. During the 1960s, Massimiliano Fuksas worked in his atelier. In 1974 de Chirico was elected to the French Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. He died in Rome on 20 November 1978. In 1992 his remains were moved to the Roman church of San Francesco a Ripa. Style De Chirico's best-known works are the paintings of his metaphysical period. In them he developed a repertoire of motifs‚Äîempty arcades, towers, elongated shadows, mannequins, and trains among others‚Äîthat he arranged to create \\"images of forlornness and emptiness\\" that paradoxically also convey a feeling of \\"power and freedom\\".Schwartz 1990, p. 22. According to Sanford Schwartz, de Chirico‚Äîwhose father was a railroad engineer‚Äîpainted images that suggest \\"the way you take in buildings and vistas from the perspective of a train window. His towers, walls, and plazas seem to flash by, and you are made to feel the power that comes from seeing things that way: you feel you know them more intimately than the people do who live with them day by day.\\"Schwartz 1990, pp. 23‚Äì24. In 1982, Robert Hughes wrote that de Chirico In this, he resembles his more representational American contemporary, Edward Hopper: their pictures' low sunlight, their deep and often irrational shadows, their empty walkways and portentous silences creating an enigmatic visual poetry.Wells, Walter, Silent Theater: the Art of Edward Hopper, London/New York: Phaidon, 2007 Legacy De Chirico won praise for his work almost immediately from the writer Guillaume Apollinaire, who helped to introduce his work to the later Surrealists. De Chirico strongly influenced the Surrealist movement: Yves Tanguy wrote how one day in 1922 he saw one of de Chirico's paintings in an art dealer's window, and was so impressed by it he resolved on the spot to become an artist‚Äîalthough he had never even held a brush. Other Surrealists who acknowledged de Chirico's influence include Max Ernst, Salvador Dal√≠, and Ren√© Magritte, who described his first sighting of de Chirico's The Song of Love as \\"one of the most moving moments of my life: my eyes saw thought for the first time.\\" Other artists as diverse as Giorgio Morandi, Carlo Carr√†, Paul Delvaux, Carel Willink, Harue Koga and Philip Guston were influenced by de Chirico. De Chirico's style has influenced several filmmakers, particularly in the 1950s through 1970s. The visual style of the French animated film Le Roi et l'oiseau, by Paul Grimault and Jacques Pr√©vert, was influenced by de Chirico's work, primarily via Tanguy, a friend of Pr√©vert.Quelques propositions d‚Äôactivit√©s ‚Äì Le roi et l'oiseau , Paola Martini et Pascale Ramel, p. 4 The visual style of Valerio Zurlini's film The Desert of the Tartars (1976) was influenced by de Chirico's work.Rolando Caputo. \\"Literary cineastes: the Italian novel and the cinema\\". Peter E. Bondanella & Andrea Ciccarelli (eds.). The Cambridge Companion to the Italian Novel. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. Pp. 182‚Äì196. Michelangelo Antonioni, the Italian film director, also said he was influenced by de Chirico. Some comparison can be made to the long takes in Antonioni's films from the 1960s, in which the camera continues to linger on desolate cityscapes populated by a few distant figures, or none at all, in the absence of the film's protagonists. In 1958, Riverside Records used a reproduction of de Chirico's 1915 painting The Seer (originally painted as a tribute to French poet Arthur Rimbaud) as the cover art for pianist Thelonious Monk's live album Misterioso. The choice was made to capitalize on Monk's popularity with intellectual and bohemian fans from venues such as the Five Spot Caf√©, where the album had been recorded, but Monk biographer Robin Kelley later observed deeper connections between the painting and the pianist's music; Rimbaud had \\"called on the artist to be a seer in order to plumb the depths of the unconscious in the quest for clairvoyance ... The one-eyed figure represented the visionary. The architectural forms and the placement of the chalkboard evoked the unity of art and science‚Äîa perfect symbol for an artist whose music has been called 'mathematical.'\\"; Writers who have appreciated de Chirico include John Ashbery, who has called Hebdomeros \\"probably ... the finest [major work of Surrealist fiction].\\"Selected Prose, p. 89. (Originally in Book Week 4:15 (Dec. 18, 1966)) Several of Sylvia Plath's poems are influenced by de Chirico.Christina Britzolakis, \\"Conversation amongst the Ruins: Plath and de Chirico\\", in Connors & Bayley, eds., 'Eye Rhymes: Sylvia Plath's Art of the Visual' (Oxford University Press 2007) In his book Blizzard of One Mark Strand included a poetic diptych called \\"Two de Chiricos\\": \\"The Philosopher's Conquest\\" and \\"The Disquieting Muses\\". Gabriele Tinti composed three poems inspired by de Chirico's paintings: The Nostalgia of the Poet (1914), The Uncertainty of the Poet (1913), and Ariadne (1913), works in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, the Tate, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, respectively. The poems were read by actor Burt Young at the Met in 2016. The box art for Fumito Ueda's PlayStation 2 game Ico sold in Japan and Europe was strongly influenced by de Chirico. The cover art of New Order's single \\"Thieves Like Us\\" is based on de Chirico's painting The Evil Genius of a King. The music video for the David Bowie song \\"Loving the Alien\\" was partly influenced by de Chirico. Bowie was an admirer of his genderless tailors' dummies..

The genus name Merops is Ancient Greek for \\"bee- eater\\", and persicus is Latin for \\"Persian\\". It breeds in Northern Africa, and the Middle East from eastern Turkey to Kazakhstan and India. It is generally strongly migratory, wintering in tropical Africa, although some populations breed and live year-round in the Sahel. This species occurs as a rare vagrant north of its breeding range, with most vagrants occurring in Italy and Greece. Taxonomy and systematics Two subspecies are recognized: *Merops persicus persicus - Breeds in Asia, winters in East and Southern Africa. *Merops persicus chrysocercus - Breeds in North Africa, winters in West Africa. This species is closely related to blue-tailed bee-eater, M. philippinus of East Asia, and the olive bee-eater of Africa, and has been treated as being the same species (conspecific). Description This species, like other bee- eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green; its face has blue sides with a black eye stripe, and a yellow and brown throat; the beak is black. It can reach a length of , with the two elongated central tail feathers adding another . Sexes are mostly alike but the tail-streamers of the female are shorter. This is a bird which breeds in sub-tropical semi- desert with a few trees, such as acacia. It winters in open woodland or grassland. As the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. However, this species probably takes more dragonflies than any other food item. Its preferred hunting perch is telephone wires if available. Blue-cheeked bee-eaters may nest solitarily or in loose colonies of up to ten birds. They may also nest in colonies with European bee-eaters. The nests are located in sandy banks, embankments, low cliffs or on the shore of the Caspian Sea. They make a relatively long tunnel of in length in which the four to eight (usually six or seven), spherical white eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs, although the female alone incubates them at night. Incubation takes 23‚Äì26 days. The call sounds 'flatter' and less 'fluty' than the European bee-eater.

With respect to the left-hand path and right-hand path dichotomy, black magic is the malicious, left-hand counterpart of the benevolent white magic. In modern times, some find that the definition of black magic has been convoluted by people who define magic or ritualistic practices that they disapprove of as black magic. History Like its counterpart white magic, the origins of black magic can be traced to the primitive, ritualistic worship of spirits as outlined in Robert M. Place's 2009 book, Magic and Alchemy.Magic and Alchemy by Robert M. Place (Infobase Publishing, 2009) Unlike white magic, in which Place sees parallels with primitive shamanistic efforts to achieve closeness with spiritual beings, the rituals that developed into modern black magic were designed to invoke those same spirits to produce beneficial outcomes for the practitioner. Place also provides a broad modern definition of both black and white magic, preferring instead to refer to them as \\"high magic\\" (white) and \\"low magic\\" (black) based primarily on intentions of the practitioner employing them. He acknowledges, though, that this broader definition (of \\"high\\" and \\"low\\") suffers from prejudices because good-intentioned folk magic may be considered \\"low\\" while ceremonial magic involving expensive or exclusive components may be considered by some as \\"high magic\\", regardless of intent.Evans-Pritchard. \\"Sorcery and Native Opinion\\". Africa: Journal of the International African Institute Vol. 4, No. 1 (Jan., 1931) , pp. 22-55. Malleus Maleficarum, 1669 edition During the Renaissance, many magical practices and rituals were considered evil or irreligious and by extension, black magic in the broad sense. Witchcraft and non-mainstream esoteric study were prohibited and targeted by the Inquisition.White Magic, Black Magic in the European Renaissance by Paola Zambelli (BRILL, 2007) As a result, natural magic developed as a way for thinkers and intellectuals, like Marsilio Ficino, abbot Johannes Trithemius and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, to advance esoteric and ritualistic study (though still often in secret) without significant persecution. While \\"natural magic\\" became popular among the educated and upper classes of the 16th and 17th century, ritualistic magic and folk magic remained subject to persecution. 20th century author Montague Summers generally rejects the definitions of \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" magic as \\"contradictory\\", though he highlights the extent to which magic in general, regardless of intent, was considered \\"black\\" and cites William Perkins posthumous 1608 instructions in that regard:Witchcraft and Black Magic by Montague Summers (1946; reprint Courier Dover Publications, 2000) In particular, though, the term was most commonly reserved for those accused of invoking demons and other evil spirits, those hexing or cursing their neighbours, those using magic to destroy crops, and those capable of leaving their earthly bodies and travelling great distances in spirit (to which the Malleus Maleficarum \\"devotes one long and important chapter\\"), usually to engage in devil-worship. Summers also highlights the etymological development of the term nigromancer, in common use from 1200 to approximately 1500, (, black; , divination), broadly \\"one skilled in the black arts\\". In a modern context, the line between white magic and black magic is somewhat clearer and most modern definitions focus on intent rather than practice. There is also an extent to which many modern Wicca and witchcraft practitioners have sought to distance themselves from those intent on practising black magic. Those who seek to do harm or evil are less likely to be accepted into mainstream Wiccan circles or covens in an era where benevolent magic is increasingly associated with new-age beliefs and practices, and self-help spiritualism.Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft by James R. Lewis (SUNY Press, 1996) Black shamanism Black shamanism is a kind of shamanism practiced in Mongolia and Siberia. It is specifically opposed to yellow shamanism, which incorporates rituals and traditions from Buddhism. Black Shamans are usually perceived as working with evil spirits, while white Shamans with spirits of the upper world.Kevin B. Turner Sky Shamans of Mongolia: Meetings with Remarkable Healers North Atlantic Books, 12.04.2016 In some areas, there are purported malevolent sorcerers who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile. Satanism and devil-worship Illustration by Martin van Ma√´le, of a Witches' Sabbath, in the 1911 edition of La Sorciere, by Jules Michelet The influence of popular culture has allowed other practices to be drawn in under the broad banner of black magic, including the concept of Satanism. While the invocation of demons or spirits is an accepted part of black magic, this practice is distinct from the worship or deification of such spiritual beings. The two are usually combined in medieval beliefs about witchcraft. Those lines, though, continue to be blurred by the inclusion of spirit rituals from otherwise white magicians in compilations of work related to Satanism. John Dee's sixteenth century rituals, for example, were included in Anton LaVey's The Satanic Bible (1969) and so some of his practises, otherwise considered white magic, have since been associated with black magic. Dee's rituals themselves were designed to contact spirits in general and angels in particular, which he claimed to have been able to do with the assistance of colleague Edward Kelley. LaVey's Bible, however, is a \\"complete contradiction\\" of Dee's intentions but offers the same rituals as a means of contact with evil spirits and demons.Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture by Chris Mathews (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009) LaVey's Church of Satan (with LaVey's Bible at its centre), \\"officially denies the efficacy of occult ritual\\" but \\"affirms the subjective, psychological value of ritual practice\\", drawing a clear distinction between. LaVey himself was more specific: The latter quote, though, seems to have been directed toward the growing trends of Wiccanism and neo-paganism at the time. Voodoo A Voodoo doll. Voodoo has been associated with modern black magic; drawn together in popular culture and fiction. However, while hexing or cursing may be accepted black magic practices, Voodoo has its own distinct history and traditions that have little to do with the traditions of modern witchcraft that developed with European practitioners like Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley.\\"Voodoo 2.0.\\" Newsweek Global 163.9 (2014): 92-98.

But their penchant for magic associated with curses, poisons and zombies means they, and Voodoo in general, are regularly associated with black magic in particular.Voodoo Rituals: A User's Guide by Heike Owusu (Sterling Publishing Company, 2002)  Black magic in India  Kuttichathan seva Chathan seva is a kind of black magic done to satisfy Chathan, also known as Vishnumaya, who is a deity worshiped by some tribes in Kerala, particularly in the village of in Peringottukara, where major chathan seva temples are located. The ritual, can be performed either to benefit or to harm the person in whose name the puja is performed. Astrologers in Kerala often advertise chathan seva services in newspapers and magazines. Peringottukara Devasthanam is the most ancient and the biggest vishnumaya kuttichathan temple in India. Black magic and religion The links and interaction between black magic and religion are many and varied. Beyond black magic's links to organised Satanism or its historical persecution by Christianity and its inquisitions, there are links between religious and black magic rituals. The Black Mass, for example, is a sacrilegious parody of the Catholic Mass. Likewise, a saining, though primarily a practice of white magic, is a Wiccan ritual analogous to a christening or baptism for an infant.\\"Black Mass.\\" Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia (2014): 1p. 1.

Waite provided a comprehensive account of black magic practices, rituals and traditions in The Book of Black Magic and Ceremonial Magic.The Book of Black Magic and Ceremonial Magic by Arthur Edward Waite (1911; reprint 2006) Other practitioners have expanded on these ideas and offered their own comprehensive lists of rituals and concepts. Black magic practices and rituals include: * True name spells - the theory that knowing a person's true name allows control over that person, making this wrong for the same reason. This can also be used as a connection to the other person, or to free them from another's a compulsion, so it is in the grey area. * Immortality rituals - from a Taoist perspective, life is finite, and wishing to live beyond one's natural span is not with the flow of nature. Beyond this, there is a major issue with immortality. Because of the need to test the results, the subjects must be killed. Even a spell to extend life may not be entirely good, especially if it draws life energy from another to sustain the spell.\\"Immortality\\". Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia (2014): 1p. 1. Web. 11 February 2015. * Necromancy ‚Äì for purposes of usage, this is defined not as general black magic, but as any magic having to do with death itself, either through divination of entrails, or the act of raising the dead body, as opposed to resurrection or CPR.\\"necromancy\\". Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed.). Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster.

It is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia where many populations are strongly migratory, and seen seasonally in many parts but breeding colonially in small areas across their range, mostly in river valleys, where the nest by tunneling into loamy sand banks. They are seen mostly in open habitats close to water.  Description  This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green; its face has a narrow blue patch with a black eye stripe, and a yellow and brown throat; the tail is blue and the beak is black. The three outer toes are united around their bases. It can reach a length of 23‚Äì26 cm, including the two elongated central tail feathers which can jut two inches more than the remaining ten feathers. Sexes are alike. This species is usually found near water and like other bee-eaters it predominantly eats flying insects, especially bees (as large as the Xylocopa sp.), wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. They may also forage in flight over estuaries, backwaters and even over the sea but not far from the coast. This species probably takes bees and dragonflies in roughly equal numbers. The insects that are caught are beaten on the perch to kill and break the exoskeleton. This habit is seen in many other members of the order Coraciiformes. They call mainly in flight with a rolling chirping whistling '. The only confusable species within its range is the blue-cheeked bee-eater which however tends to be found in drier areas. The blue-tailed differs in having the rump and tail blue rather than green and black. The undertail feathers are bluish rather than green in the blue-cheeked. The blue cheek patch is much smaller while the chestnut on the throat and breast darker and covering a larger area. They breed in April to May in India nesting colonially with closely placed nest holes in a vertical mudbank or even burrowing into gently sloping land. They tend to choose sandy and sandy clay loams but avoid heavier clay loams. They also prefer clear mud banks without any vegetation cover. In Sri Lanka, they have been noted to breed in artificial sand dunes created by dredging of sea sand. The nest tunnel can run nearly 2 metres deep. About 5 to 7 near spherical eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs. The parents guard the nest to prevent intraspecific brood parasitism and extra pair copulation. These birds also feed and roost communally. One or two helpers may join the breeding pair after incubation begins. Although males and females appear similar to the human eye, males tend to have longer central tail feather extensions and UV reflectance studies demonstrate that healthy males had darker chestnut throats and brighter green body plumage while females showed brighter blue rumps and yellow chins.  Taxonomy and systematics  This species has sometimes been considered to be conspecific with the blue-cheeked bee-eater which is a close sister taxon, the two forming a clade with the Madagascan olive bee-eater. In the past the species has been treated variously as M. persicus javanicus, M. superciliosus javanicus, and M. superciliosus philippinus.  Ecological interactions  Based on the presence of spores of Nosema ceranae in the droppings of blue- tailed bee-eaters, it has been suggested that they may be capable of distributing the parasite to bees across a wide geographic range. A species of feather louse, Brueelia superciliosa has been described from hosts of this species in Thailand.  Distribution and movements  The species has a patchy breeding distribution across India, Myanmar, and parts of Southeast Asia. In India they are known to breed in several of the river valleys including those of the Godavari, Kaveri, Tunga Badra and Krishna rivers. They also nest in the eastern parts of Sri Lanka. Blue-tailed bee-eaters are seasonal in many parts of their range and are known to migrate diurnally en masse at some places like Tanjung Tuan (W. Malaysia) and Promsri Hill (southern Thailand). They are winter visitors in parts of Malaysia and peninsular India. The non-breeding ranges of the blue-cheeked bee-eater and blue-tailed overlap in some parts of Gujarat and western peninsular India.  Status  The Blue-tailed bee-eater is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Structure  Marketing management employs tools from economics and competitive strategy to analyze the industry context in which the firm operates. These include Porter's five forces, analysis of strategic groups of competitors, value chain analysis and others. In competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of vertical integration, historical responses to industry developments, and other factors. Marketing management often conduct market research and marketing research to perform marketing analysis. Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include: * Qualitative marketing research, such as focus groups and various types of interviews * Quantitative marketing research, such as statistical surveys * Experimental techniques such as test markets * Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis. Example of SWOT analysis chart =Brand audit= A brand audit is a thorough examination of a brand's current position in an industry compared to its competitors and the examination of its effectiveness. When it comes to brand auditing, six questions should be carefully examined and assessed: #How well the business‚Äô current brand strategy is working, #What the company's established resource strengths and weaknesses are, #What its external opportunities and threats are, #How competitive the business‚Äô prices and costs are, #How strong the business‚Äô competitive position in comparison to its competitors is, and #What strategic issues are facing the business. When a business is conducting a brand audit, the goal is to uncover business‚Äô resource strengths, deficiencies, best market opportunities, outside threats, future profitability, and its competitive standing in comparison to existing competitors. A brand audit establishes the strategic elements needed to improve brand position and competitive capabilities within the industry. Once a brand is audited, any business that ends up with a strong financial performance and market position is more likely than not to have a properly conceived and effectively executed brand strategy. A brand audit examines whether a business‚Äô share of the market is increasing, decreasing, or stable. It determines if the company's margin of profit is improving, decreasing, and how much it is in comparison to the profit margin of established competitors. Additionally, a brand audit investigates trends in a business‚Äô net profits, the return on existing investments, and its established economic value. It determines whether or not the business‚Äô entire financial strength and credit rating is improving or getting worse. This kind of audit also assesses a business‚Äô image and reputation with its customers. Furthermore, a brand audit seeks to determine whether or not a business is perceived as an industry leader in technology, offering product or service innovations, along with exceptional customer service, among other relevant issues that customers use to decide on a brand of preference. A brand audit usually focuses on a business‚Äô strengths and resource capabilities because these are the elements that enhance its competitiveness. A business‚Äô competitive strengths can exist in several forms. Some of these forms include skilled or pertinent expertise, valuable physical assets, valuable human assets, valuable organizational assets, valuable intangible assets, competitive capabilities, achievements and attributes that position the business into a competitive advantage, and alliances or cooperative ventures. The basic concept of a brand audit is to determine whether a business‚Äô resource strengths are competitive assets or competitive liabilities. This type of audit seeks to ensure that a business maintains a distinctive competence that allows it to build and reinforce its competitive advantage. What's more, a successful brand audit seeks to establish what a business capitalizes on best, its level of expertise, resource strengths, and strongest competitive capabilities, while aiming to identify a business‚Äô position and future performance. = Marketing strategy = Two customer segments are often selected as targets because they score highly on two dimensions: # The segment is attractive to serve because it is large, growing, makes frequent purchases, is not price sensitive (i.e. is willing to pay high prices), or other factors; and # The company has the resources and capabilities to compete for the segment's business, can meet their needs better than the competition, and can do so profitably. A commonly cited definition of marketing is simply \\"meeting needs profitably\\". The implication of selecting target segments is that the business will subsequently allocate more resources to acquire and retain customers in the target segment(s) than it will for other, non-targeted customers. In some cases, the firm may go so far as to turn away customers who are not in its target segment. The doorman at a swanky nightclub, for example, may deny entry to unfashionably dressed individuals because the business has made a strategic decision to target the \\"high fashion\\" segment of nightclub patrons. In conjunction with targeting decisions, marketing managers will identify the desired positioning they want the company, product, or brand to occupy in the target customer's mind. This positioning is often an encapsulation of a key benefit the company's product or service offers that is differentiated and superior to the benefits offered by competitive products. For example, Volvo has traditionally positioned its products in the automobile market in North America in order to be perceived as the leader in \\"safety\\", whereas BMW has traditionally positioned its brand to be perceived as the leader in \\"performance\\". Ideally, a firm's positioning can be maintained over a long period of time because the company possesses, or can develop, some form of sustainable competitive advantage. The positioning should also be sufficiently relevant to the target segment such that it will drive the purchasing behavior of target customers. To sum up,the marketing branch of a company is to deal with the selling and popularity of its products among people and its customers, as the central and eventual goal of a company is customer satisfaction and the return of revenue. = Implementation planning = The Marketing Metrics Continuum provides a framework for how to categorize metrics from the tactical to strategic. If the company has obtained an adequate understanding of the customer base and its own competitive position in the industry, marketing managers are able to make their own key strategic decisions and develop a marketing strategy designed to maximize the revenues and profits of the firm. The selected strategy may aim for any of a variety of specific objectives, including optimizing short-term unit margins, revenue growth, market share, long-term profitability, or other goals. After the firm's strategic objectives have been identified, the target market selected, and the desired positioning for the company, product or brand has been determined, marketing managers focus on how to best implement the chosen strategy. Traditionally, this has involved implementation planning across the \\"4 Ps\\": product management, pricing (at what price slot does a producer position a product, e.g. low, medium or high price), place (the place or area where the products are going to be sold, which could be local, regional, countrywide or international) (i.e. sales and distribution channels), and promotion. Taken together, the company's implementation choices across the 4 P's are often described as the marketing mix, meaning the mix of elements the business will employ to \\"go to market\\" and execute the marketing strategy. The overall goal for the marketing mix is to consistently deliver a compelling value proposition that reinforces the firm's chosen positioning, builds customer loyalty and brand equity among target customers, and achieves the firm's marketing and financial objectives. In many cases, marketing management will develop a marketing plan to specify how the company will execute the chosen strategy and achieve the business' objectives. The content of marketing plans varies for each firm, but commonly includes: * An executive summary * Situation analysis to summarize facts and insights gained from market research and marketing analysis * The company's mission statement or long-term strategic vision * A statement of the company's key objectives, often subdivided into marketing objectives and financial objectives * The marketing strategy the business has chosen, specifying the target segments to be pursued and the competitive positioning to be achieved * Implementation choices for each element of the marketing mix (the 4 P's) = Project, process, and vendor management = More broadly, marketing managers work to design and improve the effectiveness of core marketing processes, such as new product development, brand management, marketing communications, and pricing. Marketers may employ the tools of business process re-engineering to ensure these processes are properly designed, and use a variety of process management techniques to keep them operating smoothly. Effective execution may require management of both internal resources and a variety of external vendors and service providers, such as the firm's advertising agency. Marketers may therefore coordinate with the company's Purchasing department on the procurement of these services. Under the area of marketing agency management (i.e. working with external marketing agencies and suppliers) are techniques such as agency performance evaluation, scope of work, incentive compensation, RFx's and storage of agency information in a supplier database. = Reporting, measurement, feedback and control systems = Marketing management employs a variety of metrics to measure progress against objectives. It is the responsibility of marketing managers to ensure that the execution of marketing programs achieves the desired objectives and does so in a cost-efficient manner. Marketing management therefore often makes use of various organizational control systems, such as sales forecasts, and sales force and reseller incentive programs, sales force management systems, and customer relationship management tools (CRM). Some software vendors have begun using the term marketing operations management or marketing resource management to describe systems that facilitate an integrated approach for controlling marketing resources. In some cases, these efforts may be linked to various supply chain management systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), material requirements planning (MRP), efficient consumer response (ECR), and inventory management systems. = International marketing management = Globalization has led some firms to market beyond the borders of their home countries, making international marketing a part of those firms' marketing strategy.Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2005) International Marketing, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York Marketing managers are often responsible for influencing the level, timing, and composition of customer demand. In part, this is because the role of a marketing manager (or sometimes called managing marketer in small- and medium-sized enterprises) can vary significantly based on a business's size, corporate culture, and industry context. For example, in a small- and medium-sized enterprises, the managing marketer may contribute in both managerial and marketing operations roles for the company brands. In a large consumer products company, the marketing manager may act as the overall general manager of his or her assigned product.Kotler, P. and Keller, K.L. Marketing Management, 12th ed., Pearson, 2006, To create an effective, cost- efficient marketing management strategy, firms must possess a detailed, objective understanding of their own business and the market in which they operate. In analyzing these issues, the discipline of marketing management often overlaps with the related discipline of strategic planning.

Primarily known as a commander of light dragoons, he led mounted troops in a number of notable battles in the Carolinas during the campaigns of 1780 and 1781.  Before the war  Born in Stafford County, Virginia, William was the second son of Bailey Washington and Catherine (n√©e Storke) Washington. Primary source evidence, including correspondence between William and George Washington, first President of the United States, establishes the fact that William and George were second cousins. William was raised with a Southern planter upbringing and believed in the values of being a gentleman. Tutored by a Reverend Mr. Stuart, a clergyman from Virginia, William learned the Greek language and studied several areas of theology for a potential career in the church. Instead of a career in the ministry, he took up arms against the British government during the Revolutionary War. William and his elder brother, Henry, are said to have drawn straws to see who would get to join the Continental Army and who would stay home and manage the family plantations. William won. Revolutionary War The painting The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776 by John Trumbull. William Washington stands at right and James Monroe is on the ground at left Washington was elected a captain of Stafford County Minutemen on September 12, 1775, and became part of the 3rd Virginia Regiment, Continental Line on February 25, 1776, commanding its 7th Company. His lieutenant and second-in- command was fellow Virginian James Monroe, future fifth US. President. Their first combat was the Battle of Harlem Heights in New York on September 16, 1776, during which he may have been wounded by enemy musket fire. At the Battle of Trenton, under command of Nathanael Greene and after a night of scouting the countryside with Monroe to prevent detection, Washington led a successful assault into the town. His company drove in Hessian pickets, and seized two cannon on King Street, capturing their crews. Washington received wounds to both hands during the action, along with Lt. Monroe who was severely wounded in the shoulder. Both received thanks from Continental Army commander- in-chief George Washington. On January 27, 1777, William was promoted to the rank of major and assigned to the newly created 4th Continental Light Dragoons. In the fall of 1778, he was assigned to the 3rd Continental Light Dragoons, which was severely mauled in a surprise attack on the night of September 27 at Old Tappan, New Jersey, by a force of British light infantry. Only 55 of the lightly armed dragoons escaped the attack and their commander, Lt. Col. George Baylor, was wounded and captured. Washington was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed in command of the 3rd Light Dragoons on November 20, 1778. Washington's unit spent the summer of 1779 recruiting and remounting. On November 19, 1779, his unit was transferred to the Southern theatre of war, and marched to join the army of Major General Benjamin Lincoln in Charleston, South Carolina. On March 10, 1780, Washington's regiment joined forces with the remnants of the 1st Continental Light Dragoons at Bacon's Bridge, South Carolina, to reconnoiter and screen against the advancing British. On March 26, his first encounter with the British Legion, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, resulted in a minor victory near Rantowle's Bridge on the Stono River in South Carolina. Afterward, on the Ashley River during the fight at Rutledge's Plantation on March 26, 1780, Lt. Col. Washington again bested a detachment of Tarleton's dragoons and infantry. Tarleton, however, attacked the encampment of General Isaac Huger at Monck's Corner on the night of April 14, 1780, and routed the Continentals, including the 3rd Light Dragoons, which lost 15 dead, 17 wounded, and 100 dragoons captured, along with 83 horses. Washington and his remaining troops fled across the Santee River to escape capture. The severe attrition of Washington's command forced its amalgamation with the 1st Continental Light Dragoons under Lt. Col. Anthony Walton White. This force was defeated at Lenud's Ferry, waiting to cross the flooded Santee, on May 6, 1780. White was captured and Washington assumed command of the 1st-and-3rd Dragoons. The force withdrew to North Carolina when Lincoln surrendered the southern army and Charleston on May 12. The reconstituted Southern army, now under General Horatio Gates, was defeated at the Battle of Camden, South Carolina, on August 16, 1780, which opened up the South to British control. Gates was replaced by General Nathanael Greene, who divided his army into two groups, one of which was led by General Daniel Morgan and the other by himself. Washington was placed under the command of General Morgan, for whom he participated in a series of raids in the western part of South Carolina. Two notable successes were the capture of Rugeley's Mill near Camden on December 4, 1780; Washington with 60 troops bluffed 112 Loyalists into surrendering a strongly fortified homestead without firing a shot by use of a \\"Quaker Gun\\", mounting a felled tree trunk on wagon axles to resemble a cannon; and the defeat of a Tory partisan unit at Hammond's Old Store in the Little River District on December 27, 1780; Washington routed 250 Georgia Loyalists, killing or wounding 150 and capturing the rest. William Washington at the Battle of Cowpens The Battle of Cowpens, painted by William Ranney in 1845. The scene depicts an unnamed black soldier (left) firing his pistol and saving the life of Colonel William Washington (on white horse in center). These successes led to Tarleton being ordered by Lord Cornwallis to chase down Morgan's \\"flying corps\\", leading to the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781. Morgan's battle plans called for Washington's group, 80 Continental dragoons and 45 mounted Georgia infantry, to serve as a defensive and offensive unit as the situation required. Washington's first encounter with the enemy involved the rescue of a South Carolina militia unit as it was reloading behind the front lines of Morgan's left flank and under attack by a unit of Tarleton's dragoons. Crushing the attackers, Washington regrouped and followed with an attack on Tarleton's left flank infantry. After repeated assaults by Washington, they moved through the infantry and attacked a small artillery position behind Tarleton's front lines. With the main British infantry surrender and during Tarleton's retreat, Washington was in close pursuit and found himself somewhat isolated. He was attacked by the British commander and two of his men. Tarleton was stopped by Washington himself, who attacked him with his sword, calling out, \\"Where is now the boasting Tarleton?\\" A cornet of the 17th, Thomas Patterson, rode up to strike Washington but was shot by Washington's orderly trumpeter.Historical record of the 17th Light dragoons Washington survived this assault and in the process wounded Tarleton's right hand with a sabre blow, while Tarleton creased Washington's knee with a pistol shot that also wounded his horse. Washington pursued Tarleton for sixteen miles, but gave up the chase when he came to the plantation of Adam Goudylock near Thicketty Creek. To escape capture by Washington, Tarleton had forced Goudylock to serve as an escape guide.Hays, Joel Stanford, \\"Adam Goudylock (ca. 1726-1796), Planter, of Albemarle County, Virginia, and Union County, South Carolina,\\" The American Genealogist 88 (2016), 49-56, 107-117, at 53-54. For his valor at Cowpens, Washington received a silver medal awarded by the Continental Congress executed under the direction of Thomas Jefferson. The unique silver medal was designed by French artists Du Pre and De Vivier. (A British version of this duel can be found under Chapter 33 Year 1781.) 1st Virginia Cavalry, under command of Lieut. Col. William Washington, Guilford Courthouse National Military Park, present-day Greensboro, North Carolina After the Battle of Cowpens, Washington's dragoons assisted the retreat of General Nathanael Greene to Dan River in Virginia by rearguard actions against forces commanded by Lord Cornwallis. Afterward, Washington returned to North Carolina to act as vanguard for Greene's army. On April 25, 1781, at the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill, Greene was attacked by British colonel Lord Rawdon. Ordered to attack Rawdon's flank, Washington was unable to complete the maneuver while policing prisoners, forcing Greene to retreat. On September 8, 1781, the Battle of Eutaw Springs, the last major battle in the Carolinas, was Washington's final action. Midway through the battle, Greene ordered Washington to charge a portion of the British line positioned in a blackjack thicket along Eutaw Creek. The thicket proved impenetrable and British fire repulsed the mounted charges. During the last charge, Washington's mount was shot out from under him, and he was pinned beneath his horse. He was bayoneted and taken prisoner, and held under house arrest in the Charleston area for the remainder of the war. The British commander in the South, Lord Cornwallis, would later comment that \\"there could be no more formidable antagonist in a charge, at the head of his cavalry, than Colonel William Washington.\\"  Post-American Revolution  On April 21, 1782, Washington married Jane Elliott of Sandy Hill, South Carolina. Elliott and Washington met when she made his regiment a battle flag that was carried into combat from Cowpens to Eutaw Springs. After the war, the married couple settled near Charleston, South Carolina, on Sandy Hill plantation‚Äîoriginally owned by Jane Elliott‚Äîwith ownership of other properties in the St. Paul Parish. On 27 December 1785, the new couple purchased a townhouse at 8 South Battery in Charleston. The couple took up farming (a low- country planter) and raising thoroughbred horses. Washington was elected to the State legislature from 1787 to 1804 but refused to run for State Governor because he, in his words, \\"was not born a Carolinian.\\" Washington also accepted a post of brigadier general commanding the Seventh Brigade of the South Carolina State Militia in 1794. During the naval war with France in 1798 former President George Washington was appointed by President Adams' Administration as commander of the American Army. George Washington offered a general's commission and staff position to William Washington, and he accepted the rank of Brigadier General and served on George Washington's staff. He served the United States Army from 1798 to 1800, and concerned himself with the defenses of South Carolina and Georgia. After a lingering illness, William Washington died on March 6, 1810, at the age of 58. He was buried at Live Oak, a plantation near Sandy Hill. He was survived by his wife, a son, and a daughter. His daughter was married to General Alexander Spotswood, a grandson of Virginia Governor Alexander Spotswood. In retrospect, William Washington is viewed as a fine officer and premier cavalry commander. He showed skill, bravery, and daring on the battlefield inspiring victory and confidence in the war of American Independence from the British Crown. References  Further reading  * Haller, Stephen.

The term originates with the London Underground; such layouts exist in other networks but are not commonly so named. In the United States, it is often referred to as a \\"cross-platform transfer\\". This configuration occurs at a station with island platforms, with a single platform in between the tracks allocated to two directions of travel, or two side platforms between the tracks, connected by level corridors. The benefit of this design is that passengers do not need to use stairs to another platform level for transfer, thus increasing the convenience of users. A cross-platform interchange arrangement may be costly due to the complexity of rail alignment, especially if the railway designers also arrange the track with flyovers (which is typically done to increase efficiency). A common two- directions cross-platform interchange configuration consists of two directions of two different lines sharing an island platform, and the respective return directions of both lines sharing a different island platform in the same station complex. Much rarer is a cross-platform interchange to transfer onto the same line as in Kirkby and Ormskirk. Types The four cross-platform interchange stations in Taipei Metro, showing the tripartite-interchange system on the right =Between one line with continuous track but no overlapping services= Kirkby railway station (until 1977) and Ormskirk railway station (until 1970) were double-track railway, when they were converted into single-track railway with cross-platform interchange separated by buffers but on the same track alignment. =Between different lines= Common cross-platform interchanges allow passengers to change trains without changing to another platform. This applies at places where trains of different directions meet in minor and major hubs, but this arrangement is only found at some interchange stations in metro and other rail networks worldwide. =Between different train categories= Some railway lines, usually in more congested areas, also offer cross-platform interchanges between different categories of trains, for example between express and stopping (\\"local\\") trains. For instance, this kind of interchange is used at many European railway minor hubs to connect fast trains to local feeder services, as well as surface sections of suburban lines like the RER E in Paris or the Metro North Hudson Line in New York State. However, local‚Äìexpress interchanges are found in only a few metro networks, such as Chicago, Chengdu, London, New York City, and Philadelphia. The New York City Subway system has numerous stations facilitating cross-platform transfers between local and express trains, typically using pairs of island platforms, each serving express trains on one side, and local trains on the other side, with both alternatives headed in the same direction. As express and stopping trains usually head for different directions, cross-platform interchange between different train categories (e.g. interchanges between metros and railways) is commonly combined with cross-platform interchanges between different lines. Service levels of connections Double cross platform interchange looking from one train through another train (which has its doors open on both sides) to reveal a third train at in London In some, but not all, cases, the trains are coordinated in the timetable. =Noncoordinated= In the case, the cross-platform infrastructure offers the possibility of easily changing trains, independently from the waiting time for the second train. In metro systems with short headways, waiting time is small, but such an noncoordinated approach could reduce the advantages of stairless cross-platform interchange in railway networks with less dense train traffic. =Coordinated= A more advanced approach involves the coordination of the lines' timetables to reduce the scheduled changing time, either from one line to the other, or, ideally, bidirectionally, between both trains at the same time. This concept is widely used in Dutch, German, and Swiss railway networks, where trains of different lines meet at the same platforms in numerous hubs all over the country. =Optimised, with connection guarantee= Most advanced are coordinated cross-platform interchanges wherein interconnected trains also wait for each other to 'guarantee' scheduled interchanges, even in the event of modest delays. In order to still ensure on- time running across the network, additional waiting time for trains is usually limited to a certain period of time depending on general network performance, further connections to be guaranteed, train category, train line, and a balanced consideration of other factors. In practice, most railways coordinating cross-platform interchanges define a certain waiting time window for each 'guaranteed' interchange. Some railway operators will briefly delay train departure signals to allow imminently arriving passengers time to interchange. For example, the Vienna U-Bahn metro signals train drivers to wait briefly, by operating a special white light signal triggered by the approach of an interchange train on another track. Example interchanges In most cases, only cross-platform interchanges used for both directions of travel are listed, with some exceptions. =Asia= Beijing Guogongzhuang station offers cross-platform interchange between Line 9 and Fangshan Line. National Library station offers cross-platform interchange between Lines 4 and 9. In addition Nanluoguxiang station(Chinese) \\"ÂçóÈî£ÈºìÂ∑∑Âú∞ÈìÅÁ´ôÂèØÂèåÂêëÂêåÂè∞Êç¢‰πò\\" baic.gov.cn 2012-05-17 (Lines 6 and 8), Zhuxinzhuang station (Changping Line and Line 8), Beijing West railway station (Lines 7 and 9), Yancun East station (Fangshan Line and Yanfang Line) offer cross-platform interchange. Chengdu Cross-platform interchanges between different train categories in Xipu Railway Station, Chengdu. The double track of Line 2 of Chengdu Metro is in the middle, while the double tracks of national rail transport system (Chengdu‚ÄìDujiangyan intercity railway) are on both sides. Xipu Station in Chengdu provides cross-platform interchange between Line 2 of Chengdu Metro and Chengdu‚ÄìDujiangyan Intercity Railway of the national rail transport system. It is the first implementation of cross-platform interchanges between different train categories in China. Metro-only cross- platform interchanges exist between Lines 2, 4 and 5 at Chengdu University of TCM & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital station and outbound direction interchanges between Line 3 and Line 10 at Taipingyuan Station. Chongqing Line 5 and Line 6 of the Chongqing Rail Transit offer a paired cross-platform interchange for passengers transferring among 4 directions between the two lines at Ranjiaba and Dalongshan stations. Dalian The Dalian Metro has a cross platform interchange between Line 1 and Line 12 at Hekou Station. Guangzhou Guangzhou Metro offers three two way cross-platform interchanges by 2016, between Line 2 and Line 3 at Jiahewanggang Station, between Line 8 and the extended Guangfo Line at Shayuan Station and one between both branches of Line 3 at Tiyu Xilu Station. At Tiyu Xilu Station the northern section of Line 3 terminates at the center track serving both island platforms connecting to the southern section of Line 3 stopping at the outer tracks. In 2016, a single direction cross platform interchange started operating between the westbound Line 7 and northbound Line 2 trains at Guangzhou South Railway Station. Hangzhou Hangzhou Metro's East Railway Station and Pengbu Station offer paired cross-platform interchange between Line 1 and Line 4. Qianjiang Road Station offers a single cross-platform interchange between Line 2 and Line 4. There is a provision for another paired cross-platform interchange at West Lake Cultural Square and Wulin Square Stations between Line 1 and the planned Line 3. Another provision for cross-platform interchange was also made at Coach Center Station between Lines 1 and the planned Line 9. More cross-platform interchanges are under construction including one at University of Eastern Medicine Station between Lines 4 and 6. Hong Kong Yau Tong Station cross-platform interchange In the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system of Hong Kong, cross-platform interchange stations first appeared at Mong Kok and Prince Edward stations when Tsuen Wan Line was opened. The interchange is two stations long, with inverse cross-platform interchange assigned to Prince Edward and same- direction interchange to Mong Kok as large volumes of traffic had been anticipated in both modes. Popular with passengers, this design was repeated on Admiralty Station when the Island Line was opened to deal with the heavy opposite-direction interchange anticipated. Years later, another interchange spanning Tiu Keng Leng Station (same direction) and Yau Tong Station (opposite direction) was built to the same configuration as Mong Kok and Prince Edward. The Ma On Shan Line is specifically designed to follow right-hand traffic rules unlike other railway lines in Hong Kong to enable a single-direction cross-platform interchange at Tai Wai Station to the East Rail Line while keeping all platforms at roughly the same height. Another configuration found in Lai King Station makes commute in both directions more convenient by aligning both tracks leading towards city next to each other on one level, and both tracks leading away from city next to each other on the other level. The configuration for North Point Station is similar to provide convenience for passengers travelling towards city, although the distance between the two platforms are longer compared to other stations. Before the MTR-KCR merger in 2007, Nam Cheong Station was served by MTR's Tung Chung Line and KCR's West Rail line. Due to the different fare system, platforms of southbound Tung Chung Line and northbound West Rail were separated by wall even though they were at similar elevations. After the merger, some sections of the wall was demolished in order to provide cross-platform interchange between southbound Tung Chung Line and northbound West Rail Line. However, this arrangement does not serve the dominant rush hour passenger flows, which are between New Territories and Hong Kong Island, as well as between Lantau Island and Tsim Sha Tsui. By connecting East Rail and West Rail lines at Hung Hom without through-running, both lines terminate there alternating on both East/West Rail platforms to offer cross-platform interchanges. At Sunny Bay Station, passengers on the Tung Chung Line from the city can make a cross-platform interchange to a Disneyland Resort Line Train. However, the inverse is not the case, as passengers returning to the city from Hong Kong Disneyland need to use an overpass to catch a Hong Kong-bound train. Kuala Lumpur Putra Heights is an interchange station between 2 LRT lines-Sri Petaling Line and Kelana Jaya Line. offers cross-platform interchange between Sri Petaling Line (Line 4) and Kelana Jaya Line (Line 5) while offers cross-platform interchange between Ampang Line (Line 3) and Sri Petaling Line (Line 4) Kyoto There is a cross-platform interchange between the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line and the Keihan Keishin Line at . Nanjing Nanjing Metro's Nanjing South Railway Station offers cross-platform interchange between Lines 1 and 3 and single direction cross platform interchange between Line S1 and Line S3.

Nanning A paired cross platform interchange is available between Line 1 and Line 2 at Nanning railway station and Chaoyang Square station. Osaka The Osaka Metro has a cross-platform interchange between the Midosuji Line and the Yotsubashi Line at Daikokuch≈ç, where the platforms are at the same level. Kintetsu Railway also has a cross-platform interchange between the Nara Line and the Osaka Line at Tsuruhashi, where the platforms are at the same level. Hanshin Railway has a same direction cross- platform interchange between the Namba Line and Hanshin Main Line at Amagasaki. Qingdao Cross-platform interchange is available between Line 2 and Line 3 at Wusi Square Station. A provisions for cross platform interchange between Line 3 and the under construction Line 8 were made at Qingdao North Railway Station. Seoul Seoul Subway Geumjeong Station offers cross-platform transfer between Line 1 local services and all 4 services. Gimpo Airport Station also offers cross-platform transfer between all Line 9 services and AREX local service. Also several Line 1 stations offer cross-platform transfer between trains heading to Incheon or Cheonan/Sinchang. Shanghai Oriental Sports Center Station offers cross-platform interchange between Lines 6 and 11. In addition, Hongqiao Railway Station provides cross platform interchange between Lines 2 and 17. While Hongqiao Airport Terminal 2 Station provides a single direction cross-platform interchange between the Line 2 Pudong International Airport bound trains and Line 10 Xinjiangwancheng bound trains. Shenzhen Shenzhen metro network includes cross-platform interchanges at Laojie station (Lines 1 and 3) one direction on top of the other and at Huangbeiling station (LInes 2 and 5) with two parallel island platforms. Cross platform interchanges also have started operation in Chegongmiao (Lines 7 and 9), Hongshuwan South (Lines 9 and 11) and constructed for future use at Huangmugang and Nanyou stations. Singapore Bayfront interchange in Singapore The Mass Rapid Transit system in Singapore has a similar two-station transfer arrangement to allow quick transfers between North South and East West lines. Both City Hall MRT station and Raffles Place MRT station have double underground island platforms stacked on top the other, allowing commuters to switch trains to a different line by walking across the same platform at the appropriate station. Jurong East MRT station has a less complicated arrangement, with the terminating rail for the North South Line aligned between that of the East West Line, allowing commuters to alight and board simultaneously on either side, with an additional rail for the North South Line used during peak hours. Tanah Merah MRT station also has a less complicated arrangement, with the terminating rail for the East West line Changi Airport Extension aligned between that of the East West line Main Line, allowing commuters to alight and board simultaneously on either side. The Bayfront MRT station is also a cross- platform interchange with double underground island platforms between the Marina Bay branch of the Circle Line and Downtown Line; the original plans for Promenade MRT station contained a similar arrangement but the existing Circle Line tracks to and from Dhoby Ghaut need to be crossed at the same levels by Downtown Line trains. Tehran Sadeghieh metro station of Tehran metro offers cross-platform interchanges between both terminating metro lines 2 and 5; while suburban line 5 uses the outer tail tracks of each platform, metro line 2 uses one platform for alighting and the other for boarding. Line 2 uses platforms 2 and 3, and Line 5 uses platforms 1 and 4. Eram-e Sabz metro station also has a cross-platform interchange. It has a cross platform interchange between Lines 4 and 5. Line 4 uses platforms 1 and 4, and Line 5 uses platforms 2 and 3. Taipei Guting Station, a main interchange station of Taipei Metro, provides cross-platform interchange between the Xindian Line (Green Line) and Zhonghe Xinlu Line (Orange Line) in Taipei, Taiwan. The Taipei Metro has four stations for cross-platform interchanges: Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall Station (between the Songshan-Xindian Line and Tamsui-Xinyi Line), Ximen Station (between the Songshan-Xindian Line and Bannan Line), Guting Station (between the Songshan-Xindian Line and the Zhonghe-Xinlu Line) and Dongmen Station (between Zhonghe-Xinlu Line and the Tamsui-Xinyi Line). All these stations have two island platforms on different floors, most of them are same-direction cross-platform configuration except Dongmen Station which has an inverse cross-platform. Beitou Station allows for cross-platform transfers for southbound trains only due to differing operating routes. Tokyo Akasaka-mitsuke station track diagram, showing how cross-platform transfer works In the Tokyo Metro, Akasaka-mitsuke Station provides cross-platform transfer between Ginza Line and Marunouchi Line. At Omotesand≈ç Station, transfer between Ginza Line and Hanz≈çmon Line can be done on its two island platforms at the same level. Shirokane-takanawa Station uses the same way to offer cross-platform interchange between Namboku Line and Mita Line. At Kudanshita Station, cross-platform interchange is possible between a Shinjuku bound Shinjuku Line train and an Oshiage bound Hanz≈çmon Line train. In JR-East commuter network at Shinjuku Station, transfers between Yamanote Line and Ch≈´≈ç-S≈çbu Line use directional cross-platform interchange on two parallel island platforms. Between and , there are cross-platform interchanges between the Yamanote Line and the Keihin-Tohoku Line. At Ochanomizu Station, cross-platform interchange is between Ch≈´≈ç-S≈çbu Line and Ch≈´≈ç Rapid Line. In the Tokyu Railway network at ≈åokayama Station, cross platform interchange is provided between the Meguro Line and the ≈åimachi Line. In addition Naka-Meguro Station provides cross platform interchange is available between the T≈çky≈´ T≈çyoko Line and Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line. Wuhan Wuhan's paired cross- platform transfer Line 2 and Line 4 of Wuhan Metro's Hongshan Square Station and Zhongnan Road Station offer paired cross-platform interchange for passengers transferring among 4 directions of the two lines. The configuration for the two stations is similar to that of Mong Kok and Prince Edward stations in Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (see above). Passengers riding on Line 2 from Hankou wishing to reach Wuchang Railway Station, can transfer at Zhongnan Road Station by crossing the platform. Those who going to Wuhan Railway Station, can transfer at Hongshan Square Station by crossing the platform, and vice versa. Two more cross platform interchanges opened in Wuhan at Zhongjiacun Station between Line 4 and Line 6, and Hongtu Boulevard Station between Line 2 and Line 3. Zhengzhou *Shibalihe Station offers cross- platform interchange between Line 2 and Line 9. Line 2 uses platforms 2 and 3 while Line 9 uses platforms 1 and 4. It already serves the Chengjiao line, which will be part of future line 9. * Future interchanges: ** Zhengzhou East Railway Station will provide cross-platform interchange between Line 5 and Line 8. Line 5 uses platforms 3 and 6 while Line 8 uses platforms 4 and 5. The station already serves Line 1, using platform 1 and 2 which on floor -2. ** Zhangjiacun Station, under construction, will provide interchange between Line 4 and Line 7. Line 4 uses platforms 2 and 3 while Line 7 uses platforms 1 and 4. Line 4 will open in 2020. ** Dingruijie Station, under construction, end of Line 16, will provide interchange between Line 4 and Line 16. Line 4 uses platforms 1 and 4 while Line 7 uses platforms 2 and 3. Line 4 will open in 2020. * Shibalihe Station has already operated for Chengjiao Line. Note: Lines 4 and 5 are under construction while Lines 7 and 8 are preparing to start construction. Line 9 and 16 are still under planning. =Europe= Amsterdam Amsterdam metro network includes cross-platform interchanges at Van der Madeweg station between metro lines 50 and 53 and eventually in the future also at Amsterdam South station between metro lines 50 and 52. Further, cross-platform connections are offered at Amstel station between metro lines 51, 53, 54 and suburban services of Netherlands Railways. Barcelona By 2011, Barcelona metro only offers one cross-platform interchange between metro lines L4 and L11 at Trinitat Nova station where both lines terminate on one track each side of the shared island platform. Berlin The Berlin suburban rail network includes cross-platform transfers at Berlin East and at Baumschulenweg / Sch√∂neweide, Bornholmer Stra√üe, Gesundbrunnen, Treptower Park and Wannsee suburban railway stations. Berlin metro services offer cross- platform connections at Mehringdamm (metro lines U6/U7), Nollendorfplatz (metro line U4 with outbound lines U1/U3) and Wittenbergplatz (metro lines U2/U3, outbound also U1) metro stations. Additionally, Wuhletal station offers cross-platform interchanges between lines S5 of Berlin suburban rail and U5 of Berlin metro. Jungfernheide metro station was built for cross-platform interchanges between line U7 and an extended line U5 towards Tegel Airport; the extension plan was abandoned following the decision to replace Tegel Airport with Berlin Brandenburg Airport. A part of one of the U5 tunnels is used by Berlin firefighters for fire and rescue training in a metro tunnel with an original train taken out-of-service. Similar provisions were also made at Schlo√üstra√üe metro station for cross-platform interchanges between line U9 and a never realised line U10. Bochum In Bochum's light rail and tram (operated by Bogestra) network, a cross-platform interchange is offered at Bochum Hauptbahnhof station between light rail line U35 and sub-surface tram lines 302 and 310 on the lower level of the underground light rail station complex. U35 and 302/310 services to the south and southeast, and to the north and north-east stop at the same platforms. Brussels Brussels South railway station offers an interesting example of double-level cross-platform interchange, where the goal is to make it easier for passengers to \\"double back\\". The metro and premetro lines interweave so that, for example, one can arrive on the metro 2 or 6 from the north-east, walk across the island platform, and catch a tram 3 or 4 going south-east. Passengers making this journey in the opposite direction use the level below. Similar cross-platform interchanges offers Beekkant station between metro lines 1/5 and 2/6; in this area, lines 1/5 run on the right while lines 2/6 run on the left due to historical layout when formerly line 1B between Herrmann Debroux and Roi Baudoin stations branched off line 1B (running between Stockel and Erasme stations) and line 1A needed to change driving direction at Beekkant station. At Brussels North premetro station cross platform interchange is offered between tram lines 25 and 55 coming from Schaerbeek to the premetro lines 3 and 4 towards the city center.  Bucharest  Basarab station of metro lines M1 and M4 is the only cross-platform interchange in the Bucharest metro network where lines cross each other.  Charleroi  Charleroi premetro includes two stations, Beaux-Arts and Waterloo, with possible cross-platform interchanges.  Cologne  The only cross-platform interchange of the Cologne premetro network is Ebertplatz station, where passengers can change easily between high and low floor lines sharing an island platform for each direction.  Copenhagen  The Copenhagen suburban network contains cross-platform interchanges between circle line F and lines B, C, E at Hellerup station.  Duisburg  Duisburg premetro network includes two cross-platform interchange stations, Duisburg Main Railway Station for same- direction interchange and K√∂nig-Heinrich-Platz station for opposite-direction interchange.  D√ºsseldorf  D√ºsseldorf premetro network contains a four- track route between D√ºsseldorf Main Railway Station and Heinrich-Heine-Allee station comprising two island platforms for same-direction cross-platform interchange at each station; while at both mentioned stations, the two platforms are located parallel, they are built one above the other at both intermediate stations.  Essen  Essen premetro network includes two stations with cross-platform interchange on two parallel island platforms at Essen Main Railway Station and Essen Rathaus station; cross-platform connections at Essen Main Railway Station are between standard-gauge premetro lines and metre-gauge sub-surface tram lines.  Frankfurt (Main)  At Konstablerwache station, Frankfurt's suburban train lines S1 to S6, S8 and S9 and Frankfurt premetro lines U6 and U7 share one island platform for each direction, with the suburban railway (inner) side of the platforms being much longer than for the premetro. Also, the premetro station located at Frankfurt (Main) Main Railway Station was once designed for cross-platform transfers between different Frankfurt premetro lines but is now only used by premetro lines U4/U5 running along the same corridor.  Hamburg  Hamburg metro offers cross-platform interchanges at Barmbek (between circle and branch of metro line U3), Berliner Tor (between metro lines U2/U4 and U3), Kellinghusenstra√üe (between metro lines U1 and U3) and Wandsbek-Gartenstadt (between metro lines U1 and U3) metro stations; all cross-platform interchanges are also timetable coordinated to make it as easy and convenient for the passengers as possible. Another cross-platform interchange is used at the northwestern terminus of metro line U1 at Norderstedt Mitte station where metros use the outer tracks and interconnect with the non-electrified suburban line A2 of AKN private railway company terminating on the center track in between the two island platforms. Hamburg suburban railway offers cross- platform interchanges at Altona station and Hamburg Main Railway Station ensuring short connections for four of five branches to both inner city routes.  Hanover  Hanover premetro offers two cross-platform interchanges, one at Hanover Main Railway Station and one at Aegidientorplatz station.  London  Finchley Road A simplified diagram of a Cross- platform interchange at Oxford Circus tube station, between the Bakerloo line and the Victoria line In London's deep-level tube network, these usually occur in pairs for both directions of two lines. This allows for extremely quick and convenient interchange. The effect is that the two lines, despite having completely separate operation, can be treated by passengers as branches of a single network. Examples include: * Several slow and fast services have multiple cross-platform interchanges. Finchley Road offers cross platform transfers between the fast Metropolitan line and slow Jubilee line at surface level before diverging from Wembley Park. Acton Town, Barons Court, Turnham Green and Hammersmith all have cross platform transfers between the fast Piccadilly line and the slow District line. * Mile End has cross platform transfers between the District/Hammersmith & City and Central lines at sub- surface level. * Stratford has cross platform between the Central line and National Rail TfL Rail services. * For the deep-level interchanges the term \\"same level interchange\\" is sometimes preferred as there is invariably an intermediate circulating area between the platforms. Convenient same level interchanges feature at various Victoria line stations, including Stockwell with the Northern line and Euston with the Bank branch of the Northern line; Oxford Circus with the Bakerloo line; Finsbury Park with the Piccadilly line; and Highbury and Islington with the Northern City Line. There is also a cross platform interchange at Baker Street between the Bakerloo and Jubilee lines.  Lisbon  The Lisbon Metro has two stations with an island platform and two side platforms (with the island platform being used for single-direction cross-platform interchanges between lines entering downtown Lisbon): Baixa- Chiado (Lisbon Metro) (which has an inbound cross-platform transfer between the Green Line and the Blue Line) and Campo Grande (which has an inbound cross-platform transfer between the Green Line and the Yellow Line). Transfers between trains leaving downtown Lisbon require passengers to change platforms. Lisbon regional rail has cross-platform interchanges on the belt line within Lisbon as well as on the Sintra line, where Sintra line trains connect with Azambuja line trains.  Liverpool  Kirkby railway station (until 1977) and Ormskirk railway station (until 1970) were double-track railway, when they were converted into single-track railway with cross-platform interchange. Kirkby railway station single-track railway interchange (former double track railway  Madrid  Madrid Metro uses cross-platform interchanges mainly for easy transfer between urban and suburban sections operated separately on metro lines 7 (Estadio Olimpico), 9 (Puerta de Arganda) and 10 (Tres Olivos). At Casa de Campo station, metro lines 5 and 10 are interconnected cross- platform with line 5 terminating on center track in between the island platforms shared with line 10. At Principe Pio station, metro lines 6 and 10 share an island platform for each direction. Further applications of cross- platform interchanges connect only one direction of each line, for example at Pinar de Chamart√≠n station between metro lines 1 and 4.  Milan  Cadorna FN station on Milan Metro serves as interchange between M1 and M2 lines (the other one is Loreto). Each line is served by a couple of side platforms located on the same level. This provides a direct link between M1 northbound platform (towards Sesto 1¬∞ Maggio) and M2 southbound platform (towards Abbiategrasso or Assago Milanofiori Forum). All the other connections have to be done through the upper level mezzanine.  Moscow  Kitay- gorod station, interchange signs The following stations have cross-platform interchanges in Moscow Metro: * Kitay-gorod has the cross-platform interchanges between Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya and Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya lines. * Tretyakovskaya offers passengers to cross between Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya and Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya lines. * Kuntsevskaya has a cross-platform interchange between westbound Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line platform and termination platform of Filyovskaya line. * Kashirskaya ‚Äì cross-platform interchange between Zamoskvoretskaya and future Bolshaya Koltsevaya lines. * Park Pobedy, between Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya and Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya lines * Petrovsko-Razumovskaya, between Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya and Lyublinsko- Dmitrovskaya lines. * Nizhegorodskaya, between Nekrasovskaya and future Bolshaya Koltsevaya lines.  M√ºlheim (Ruhr)  M√ºlheim located roughly in the centre of the Rhein-Ruhr premetro network offers selected cross-platform interchanges at M√ºlheim (Ruhr) Main Railway Station.  Munich  Munich metro offers coordinated cross-platform connections at both Scheidplatz (metro lines U2/U3) and Innsbrucker Ring (metro lines U2/U5) metro stations; all same-direction connections are optimised, so that usually U2 and U3 respectively U5 trains of the same direction arrive, stop and depart at the same time. Neuperlach S√ºd is a combined station for Munich metro and Munich suburban rail. Original plans intended cross-platform interchanges in both directions at parallel island platforms. However, Munich suburban rail is still single-track there and offers therefore only cross-platform interchange in the outbound direction and from outbound (terminating) Munich metro U5 services to inbound Munich suburban rail S7 services. Although possible, the arrival and departure times of both lines are not matched together. Within the Munich S-Bahn (suburban rail) network, Westkreuz, Giesing, Berg am Laim and Besucherpark junction stations offer cross-platform interchanges for transfers between both branches. Under discussion are cross-platform interchanges in the same running direction for connecting the central bypass to the existing trunk route at least at Laim and Leuchtenbergring stations. At Donnersbergerbr√ºcke suburban station, cross-platform interchanges can be made in the same running direction between the S-Bahn lines along the trunk route and lines S7, S27, BOB; although not interconnected by timetables. However, the S-Bahn lines along the trunk route run frequently during most of the day: every 2 to 6 minutes on lines except S7, and every 2 to 4 minutes including the S7. At Ostbahnhof, cross-platform interchanges have been possible since 2004 between regional trains from Rosenheim and M√ºhldorf to S-Bahn lines towards Ebersberg, Erding and Munich Airport (only in these directions). Further cross-platform interchanges between Munich S-Bahn and regional trains can be made at Freising, Petershausen, Geltendorf, Grafing Bahnhof and Markt Schwaben stations, as Munich S-Bahn partly runs on mainline tracks anyway.  Nuremberg  Nuremberg metro includes one cross-platform interchange between metro lines U1/U11 and U2/U21/U3 at underground Pl√§rrer metro station where the outbound metro platform is located above the inbound.  Nizhny Novgorod  Nizhny Novgorod metro's Moskovskaya station is prepared to offer cross- platform interchanges at a later point of time between both metro lines; before 2012, both lines terminate there and are connected to through running operation eliminating any needs to change trains. After an extension was completed for Line 1 beyond Moskovskaya station, cross-platform interchange was put in use to transfer between both lines.  Paris  Paris M√©tro has cross-platform interchange at La Motte-Picquet ‚Äì Grenelle stations between Paris M√©tro line 8 and line 10, as well as Louis Blanc (Paris Metro) between Paris Metro Line 7 and Paris Metro Line 7bis. Paris RER suburban network includes cross-platform interchanges between trains of different lines at several major hubs: * Ch√¢telet - Les Halles between lines RER A and RER B * Paris North station between lines RER B and RER D It also includes cross- platform interchanges between express and local trains at several stations of the RER suburban network: * RER B at Massy - Palaiseau * RER E at Val de Fontenay. Its final station Chelles - Gournay also offers cross-platform interchange between local RER E trains and express Transilien P trains.  Rhine-Ruhr area  The suburban services in the German Rhine-Ruhr area include cross-platform interchanges at Dortmund-Dorstfeld station between lines S2 and S4 (including coordinated timetables), at D√ºsseldorf Main Railway Station and at Essen Main Railway Station. For information about the Rhine- Ruhr Stadtbahn (premetro) network, see among the related cities (Bochum, Dortmund, D√ºsseldorf, Essen, M√ºlheim).  St. Petersburg  Tekhnologichesky Institut offers cross-platform interchange between lines 1 and 2. Sportivnaya will have a cross-platform interchange between lines 5 and 8, but line 8 is not built yet.  Stockholm  Stockholm Metro includes cross-platform interchanges at T-Centralen (Main Railway Station), Gamla stan and Slussen metro stations between red and green metro lines, where T-Centralen (Main Railway Station) offers opposite-direction connections while the latter two make cross-platform connections possible in the same direction. Additionally, passengers between Nockebybanan and green metro lines can change cross-platform at Alvik station. S√∂dert√§lje Hamn railway station on the Stockholm commuter rail network provides optimised transfer between the J40, J41 and J48 lines.  Vienna  Vienna metro optimised cross-platform connections at L√§ngenfeldgasse station between lines U4 and U6 by demanding trains to wait as soon as the connecting train is approaching in case of delays or during different train intervals operated; this additional functionality is carried out by a special white light signal demanding the driver to wait. Before line U2 was extended from Schottenring further east, U2 trains terminated at (upper) U4 platform level on a center track sharing platforms with U4 trains on both sides; originally, this station level had been used for merging U2 and U4 lines and consisted of 4 tracks with 2 island platforms, but both platforms were merged to a single island platform after U2 extension opened. =North America=  Boston  At the underground level of the MBTA's North Station, the inbound platforms of the Orange Line and Green Line are arranged to allow an easy cross-platform interchange. Other transfers at this station (between the subway lines and the MBTA's bus and/or commuter rail lines) require passengers to change platform levels. The Green Line portion of Park Street station is a cross-platform interchange among the B, C, D, and E branches. A similar situation also exists at the Kenmore station, except for the E line, which does not pass through that station.  Chicago  In the Chicago \\"L\\" metro network, Howard, Wilson, Belmont and Fullerton stations offer cross-platform interchange in the same direction between different lines.  Jersey City and Newark  Sign for cross- platform transfer at Journal Square The PATH system, serving the New York metropolitan area, contains two cross-platform interchanges in Jersey City and Newark, New Jersey. At Journal Square Transportation Center in Jersey City, there is a cross-platform transfer between terminating Journal Square‚Äì33rd Street and Journal Square‚Äì33rd Street (via Hoboken) trains, and through Newark‚ÄìWorld Trade Center trains. At Pennsylvania Station in Newark, there is a cross-platform interchange between Newark‚ÄìWorld Trade Center and NJ Transit trains bound for New York City. Newark Penn Station also contains a cross- platform interchange for NJ Transit trains coming from New York City. A paid cross-platform connection exists between the Port Authority Trans-Hudson rapid transit system and Amtrak and NJT trains at Newark Penn Station, allowing passengers to switch to trains to the World Trade Center.  Montreal  Lionel-Groulx station in Montreal Two transfer stations in Montreal feature cross-platform interchange. At the Lionel-Groulx station, the upper platforms serve Henri-Bourassa or Montmorency (Orange Line 2) and Honor√©-Beaugrand (Green Line 1) trains, entering downtown; the lower platforms serve C√¥te-Vertu (Orange Line 2) and Angrignon (Green Line 1) trains, leaving downtown. Since most transferring passengers are either entering or leaving downtown, most transfers at this station are cross-platform. At the Snowdon station, however, the outbound Orange Line platforms are at the same level as the Blue Line terminal platform, with the inbound Orange Line platforms linked to the Blue Line departure platform, reducing efficiency. This is explained because the Blue Line was originally planned to be continued west of the station, in which case this arrangement would have provided the same benefit as the arrangement at Lionel-Groulx.  New York City  The New York City Subway has many three- or four-track lines with local and express service. Cross-platform interchanges are located in numerous locations throughout the system to allow for convenient transfers between express and local trains. In general, express trains run on the inner pair of tracks and bypass local-only stations, while local trains run on the outer pair of tracks and stop at every station. Express stations typically have island platforms between the express and local tracks, allowing passengers to quickly switch between trains heading in the same direction simply by crossing a platform. In addition to the very common express-local interchanges, the New York City Subway also has several cross- platform interchanges between lines that do not share a three- or four-track right-of-way: * The Queensboro Plaza station contains a same-directional cross-platform transfer between the IRT Flushing Line () and BMT Astoria Line (). The Flushing Line's connection with the Astoria Line is the line's only connection with the rest of the system. * The Hoyt‚ÄìSchermerhorn Streets and Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech stations in Brooklyn allow cross-platform interchanges between the of the IND Crosstown Line with the of the IND Fulton Street Line, the of the IND Culver Line, respectively. The Fulton Street Line does not have any track connections with the Crosstown Line, and the Fulton Street Line's track connection to the Culver Line is rarely used. * At the Seventh Avenue-53rd Street station on the , there are no track connections between the on the IND Queens Boulevard Line and the on the IND Sixth Avenue Line. At Seventh Avenue, there is also a feature unique to the system, as anti- directional cross-platform interchanges can be made here (albeit between trains heading in the same general cardinal direction, due to the track layout near the station). * The DeKalb Avenue and Prospect Park stations on the BMT Brighton Line () in Brooklyn feature cross-platform interchanges to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line () and the BMT Franklin Avenue Line (), respectively. * The Lexington Avenue‚Äì63rd Street station in Manhattan has a cross-platform interchange between the two 63rd Street Lines (). The Jamaica hub station of the Long Island Rail Road features coordinated cross-platform interchanges among the many services that stop there. During peak periods, this is enhanced by having three trains arrive at the same time, and a cross-platform interchange can be done by walking across through the train on the center track, which is waiting with its doors open on both sides. In the absence of this middle train, interchanging passengers must walk to one end of the long platform, walk to another platform, and then walk back in order to move between trains on the outer two tracks.  Philadelphia  The SEPTA Broad Street Line has cross-platform interchanges between local and express trains at Olney Transportation Center, Erie, Girard, Spring Garden, Race-Vine, City Hall, and Walnut-Locust.  San Francisco Bay Area  Three adjacent stations of the BART system, namely Oakland City Center / 12th Street, 19th Street / Oakland and MacArthur stations, feature cross-platform interchange between the Antioch‚ÄìSFO/Millbrae (yellow) line and the Richmond-Fremont (orange) line. The trains are so timed that the trains bound for Pittsburg/Bay Point and Richmond arrive at the same time at 19th Street Oakland station; the trains might arrive at the same time at the other stations too, but that is not guaranteed. Only MacArthur station has enough platforms to enable such \\"timed\\" transfer between trains bound for San Francisco Airport/Millbrae and for Fremont at the extremes of the system. The forced transfer (between the main BART systems and eBART) for continuing passengers at a transfer platform east of Pittsburg/Bay Point has a cross-platform interchange to traditional service. An intermodal cross-platform interchange exists at the Millbrae Intermodal Terminal in Millbrae, California, between Caltrain commuter rail service and BART.  Vancouver  In December 2016, Lougheed Town Centre station on the Vancouver SkyTrain was expanded to a 3-track, 2-platform station in preparation for the beginning of service on the Evergreen Extension. For the first 18 months of service on the Evergreen Extension, the third platform served eastbound trains while the southern half of the island platform served westbound trains (with Millennium Line trains running left- handed through the station); this measure allowed a same-direction cross- platform transfer between Millennium Line trains headed to VCC‚ÄìClark and Expo Line trains headed to Waterfront (via Columbia). On June 25, 2018, normal right-hand running of Millennium Line trains through the station resumed, making it possible to do an anti-directional cross-platform transfer between Expo Line trains headed for Production Way‚ÄìUniversity and Millennium Line trains headed to Lafarge Lake‚ÄìDouglas. =Oceania=  Auckland  At Newmarket Station, there are three lines serving two island platforms. Western Line services use the centre line (which can serve both platforms) allowing cross-platform interchange with Southern Line services which use the outer lines.  Melbourne  Melbourne's suburban railway offers cross-platform interchanges along the City Loop according to the operation concept depending on time and day. All three underground stations consist of four tracks and two island platforms one above each other. Burnley Group passengers can also change between Flinders Street direct and City Loop services at Richmond station on weekday mornings. Camberwell station operates as a partial cross- platform interchange off-peak, when Alamein services operate as shuttles from Camberwell. During the day, terminating trains from Alamein drop passengers off (before proceeding to a reversing track west of the station) on platform 2, which connects to a city-bound Belgrave/Lilydale line train on platform 1. At night, trains from Alamein terminate and reverse on platform 1, allowing cross-platform transfers for passengers from the city arriving on platform 2 on a Belgrave/Lilydale service.  Sydney  The Sydney Trains suburban railway system offers cross-platform interchange at Central between express and local trains to/from Strathfield as well as on the four-track section from Westmead to St Marys along the Western Line, each in the same direction. Selected cross-platform interchanges can also be made at Glenfield, Granville, Hornsby, Lidcombe, Redfern, Revesby and Town Hall. Cross-platform interchange is also available between Sydney Metro and Sydney Trains services at Chatswood. =South America=  Buenos Aires  Plaza Miserere provided cross transfer interchange between subway line A and suburban railroad line Sarmiento. There is a never used cross-platform interchange between lines A and D at Plaza de Mayo station and three abandoned cross-platform interchanges: at Primera Junta station between line A and the former tram service towards Lacarra avenue and at San Jos√© station on line E between the branch going to Bol√≠var station and the closed branch to Constituci√≥n station where another cross-platform interchange was provided between lines C and E. Suburban lines Sarmiento, San Mart√≠n and Roca offers many cross-platform interchanges between express and local services on their 4 track stretches.  Santiago de Chile  Vicu√±a Mackenna metro station is the only in the metro network of Santiago de Chile offering cross-platform transfer; the through-running line 4 and its shuttle line 4A are interconnected cross- platform here. Line 4A uses the center track between both island platforms, with line 4 stopping on the outer tracks.  S√£o Paulo  Only two stations of S√£o Paulo metro and train network offer cross-platform interchange: Para√≠so, between lines 1 (towards Jabaquara) and 2 (towards Vila Madalena), and Br√°s, between lines 7 and 11 (both towards Luz).

CI bypasses the normal acoustic hearing process to replace it with electric signals which directly stimulate the auditory nerve. A person with a cochlear implant receiving intensive auditory training may learn to interpret those signals as sound and speech. However, one third of deaf children do not develop language if they are on a CI program alone and have no sign language input. The implant has two main components. The outside component is generally worn behind the ear, but could also be attached to clothing, for example, in young children. This component, the sound processor, contains microphones, electronics that include Digital Signal Processor chips, battery, and a coil which transmits a signal to the implant across the skin. The inside component, the actual implant, has a coil to receive signals, electronics, and an array of electrodes which is placed into the cochlea, which stimulate the cochlear nerve. The surgical procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Surgical risks are minimal but can include tinnitus, facial nerve bruising and dizziness. From the early days of implants in the 1970s and the 1980s, speech perception via an implant has steadily increased. Many users of modern implants gain reasonable to good hearing and speech perception skills post-implantation, especially when combined with lipreading. However, for pre-lingually deaf children the risk of not acquiring spoken language even with an implant may be as high as 30%. One of the challenges that remain with these implants is that hearing and speech understanding skills after implantation show a wide range of variation across individual implant users. Factors such as duration and cause of hearing loss, how the implant is situated in the cochlea, the overall health of the cochlear nerve, but also individual capabilities of re-learning are considered to contribute to this variation, yet no certain predictive factors are known. Despite providing the ability for hearing and oral speech communication to children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss, there is also controversy around the devices. Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from the Deaf community. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. History An infant with a cochlear implant. Andr√© Djourno and Charles Eyri√®s invented the original cochlear implant in 1957. This original design distributed stimulation using a single channel. Two years later they went their separate ways due to personal and professional differences. William House also invented a cochlear implant in 1961. In 1964, Blair Simmons and Robert J. White implanted a single-channel electrode in a patient's cochlea at Stanford University. However, research indicated that these single-channel cochlear implants were of limited usefulness because they can not stimulate different areas of the cochlea at different times to allow differentiation between low and mid to high frequencies as required for detecting speech. NASA engineer Adam Kissiah started working in the mid-1970s on what could become the modern cochlear implant. Kissiah used his knowledge learned while working as an electronics instrumentation engineer at NASA. This work took place over 3 years, when Kissiah would spend his lunch breaks and evenings in Kennedy‚Äôs technical library, studying the impact of engineering principles on the inner ear. In 1977, NASA helped Kissiah obtain a patent for the cochlear implant; Kissiah later sold the patent rights. The modern multi-channel cochlear implant was independently developed and commercialized by two separate teams‚Äîone led by Graeme Clark in Australia and another by Ingeborg Hochmair and her future husband, Erwin Hochmair in Austria, with the Hochmairs' device first implanted in a person in December 1977 and Clark's in August 1978. Parts Cochlear implants bypass most of the peripheral auditory system which receives sound and converts that sound into movements of hair cells in the cochlea; the inside-portion of these hair cells release potassium ions in response to the movement of the hairs, and the potassium in turn stimulates other cells to release the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which makes the cochlear nerve send signals to the brain, which creates the experience of sound. Instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the cochlear nerve, causing it to send signals to the brain. There are several systems available, but generally they have the following components: External: * one or more microphones that pick up sound from the environment * a speech processor which selectively filters sound to prioritize audible speech * a transmitter that sends power and the processed sound signals across the skin to the internal device by radio frequency transmission Internal: * a receiver/stimulator, which receives signals from the speech processor and converts them into electric impulses * an electrode array embedded in the cochlea Surgical procedure The surgical procedure most often used to implant the device is called mastoidectomy with facial recess approach (MFRA). If a person's individual anatomy prevents MFRA, other approaches, such as going through the suprameatal triangle, are used. A systematic literature review published in 2016 found that studies comparing the two approaches were generally small, not randomized, and retrospective so were not useful for making generalizations; it is not known which approach is safer or more effective. The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia. Risks of the procedures include mastoiditis, otitis media (acute or with effusion), shifting of the implanted device requiring a second procedure, damage to the facial nerve, damage to the chorda tympani, and wound infections. The rate of complications is about 12% for minor complications and 3% for major complications; major complications include infections, facial paralysis, and device failure. To avoid the risk of bacterial meningitis, which while low is about thirty times as high compared to people who don't undergo CI procedures, the FDA recommends vaccination prior to the procedure. The rate of transient facial nerve palsy is estimated to be approximately 1%. Device failure requiring reimplantation is estimated to occur in 2.5‚Äì6% of the time. Up to one-third of people experience disequilibrium, vertigo, or vestibular weakness lasting more than 1 week after the procedure; in people under 70 these symptoms generally resolve over weeks to months, but in people over 70 the problems tend to persist. In the past cochlear implants were only approved for people who were deaf in both ears; a cochlear implant had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after they had learned how to speak, and none who were deaf in one ear from birth; clinical studies had been too small to draw generalizations from. Efficacy A 2011 AHRQ review of the evidence of the effectiveness of CI in people with bilateral hearing loss ‚Äî the device's primary use ‚Äî found low to moderate quality data that showed speech perception in noisy conditions was much better for people who had implants in both ears done at the same time compared to people who had only one. The data also showed that no conclusions could be drawn about changes in speech perception in quiet conditions and health-related quality-of-life. There was only one good study comparing implanting implants in both ears at the same time to implanting them sequentially; this study found that in the sequential approach, the second implantation made no change, or made things worse. Several 2010 and 2012 reviews found that the ability to communicate in spoken language was better the earlier the implantation was performed. The reviews also found that, overall, while cochlear implants provide open set speech understanding for the majority of implanted profoundly hearing-impaired children, the efficacy of cochlear implants is highly variable, and that it was not possible to accurately predict the specific outcome of the given implanted child. A 2015 review examined whether CI implantation to treat people with bilateral hearing loss had any effect on tinnitus. This review found the quality of evidence to be poor and the results variable: overall total tinnitus suppression rates varied from 8% to 45% of people who received CI; decrease of tinnitus was seen in 25% to 72%, of people; for 0% to 36% of the people there was no change; increase of tinnitus occurred in between 0% to 25% of patients; and, in between 0 and 10% of cases, people who did not have tinnitus before the procedure, got it. A 2015 literature review on the use of CI for people with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder found that, as of that date, description and diagnosis of the condition was too heterogeneous to make clear claims about whether CI is a safe and effective way to manage it. A 2016 research study found that age at implantation was highly correlated with post-operative speech understanding performance for various test measures. In this study, patients who were implanted at age 65 or older performed significantly worse on speech perception testing in quiet and in noisy conditions compared to younger CI users. The deleterious effects of aging on central auditory processing abilities are thought to play an important role in impacting an individual's speech perception abilities with CI. Prolonged duration of deafness is another factor which is thought to have a negative impact on overall speech understanding outcomes for CI users. However, this particular study found no statistical difference in the speech understanding abilities of CI patients over 65 who had been hearing impaired for 30 years or more prior to implantation. In general, outcomes for CI patients are dependent upon the individual's level of motivation, expectations, exposure to speech stimuli and consistent participation in aural rehabilitation programs. A 2016 systematic review of CI for people with unilateral hearing loss (UHL) found that of the studies conducted and published, none were randomized, only one evaluated a control group, and no study was blinded. After eliminating multiple uses of the same subjects, the authors found that 137 people with UHL had received a CI. While acknowledging the weakness of the data, the authors found that CI in people with UHL improves sound localization compared with other treatments in people who lost hearing after they learned to speak; in the one study that examined this, CI did improve sound localization in people with UHL who lost hearing before learning to speak. It appeared to improve speech perception and to reduce tinnitus. Society and culture =Usage= approximately 188,000 individuals had been fitted with cochlear implants. the same publication cited approximately 324,000 cochlear implant devices having been surgically implanted. In the U.S., roughly 58,000 devices were implanted in adults and 38,000 in children. the Ear Foundation in the United Kingdom, estimates the number of cochlear implant recipients in the world to be about 600,000. =Cost= In the United States, the overall cost of getting cochlear implants was about $100,000 Some or all of this may be covered by health insurance. In the United Kingdom, the NHS covers cochlear implants in full, as does Medicare in Australia, and the Department of Health in Ireland, Seguridad Social in Spain and Israel, and the Ministry of Health or ACC (depending on the cause of deafness) in New Zealand. According to the US National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, the estimated total cost is $60,000 per person implanted. A study by Johns Hopkins University determined that for a three-year-old child who receives them, cochlear implants can save $30,000 to $50,000 in special-education costs for elementary and secondary schools as the child is more likely to be mainstreamed in school and thus use fewer support services than similarly deaf children. =Manufacturers= the three cochlear implant devices approved for use in the US were manufactured by Cochlear Limited (Australia), Advanced Bionics (a division of Sonova) and MED- EL (Austria). In Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Canada, an additional device manufactured by Neurelec (France, a division of William Demant) was available. A device made by Nurotron (China) was also available in some parts of the world. Each manufacturer has adapted some of the successful innovations of the other companies to its own devices. There is no consensus that any one of these implants is superior to the others. Users of all devices report a wide range of performance after implantation. =Criticism and controversy= Much of the strongest objection to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, some of whom are pre-lingually Deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the Deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the \\"normal\\" body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated.Lock, M. and Nguyen, V-K., An Anthropology of Biomedicine, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is something that needs to be cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool deaf people can use to access the \\"hearing world\\" without losing their Deaf identity. It is believed by some that cochlear implants for congenitally deaf children are most effective when implanted at a young age. However evidence shows that Deaf children who sign well do better academically. Thus specialists recommend that all Deaf children should learn sign language from birth. Deaf culture critics also point out that the cochlear implant and the subsequent therapy often become the focus of the child's identity at the expense of language acquisition and ease of communication in sign language and Deaf identity. They believe that measuring a child's success only by their mastery of speech will lead to a poor self-image as \\"disabled\\" (because the implants do not produce normal hearing) rather than having the healthy self-concept of a proudly Deaf person. Children with cochlear implants are more likely to be educated orally, in the standard fashion, and without access to sign language and are often isolated from other deaf children and from sign language. Cochlear implants have been one of the technological and social factors implicated in the decline of sign languages in the developed world. Some Deaf activists have labeled the widespread implantation of children as \\"cultural genocide\\". As the trend for cochlear implants in children grows, Deaf-community advocates have tried to counter the \\"either or\\" formulation of oralism vs manualism with a \\"both and\\" or \\"bilingual-bicultural\\" approach; some schools are now successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs.

He helped lead the Philadelphia Phillies to the World Series in 1993, and won championships in 2001 with the Arizona Diamondbacks and in 2004 and 2007 with the Boston Red Sox. Schilling retired with a career postseason record of 11‚Äì2, and his .846 postseason winning percentage is a major-league record among pitchers with at least ten decisions. He is a member of the 3,000 strikeout club and has the highest strikeout-to-walk ratio of any of its members. He is tied for third for the most 300-strikeout seasons. Of post 19th century pitchers, Schilling has the second highest JAWS of any pitcher not in the Hall of Fame (behind only Roger Clemens). After retiring, he founded Green Monster Games, which was renamed 38 Studios. The company released Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning in February 2012. Three months later, they laid off their entire staff amid severe financial troubles. As a radio-personality Schilling was signed by the Howie Carr radio network to do a Saturday morning politics and sports show. An outspoken conservative, Schilling joined Breitbart in 2016. Playing career =Amateur baseball= Schilling played for Shadow Mountain High School in Phoenix, before attending Yavapai College in Prescott, Arizona in 1985. =Orioles and Astros (1988‚Äì1992)= Schilling began his professional career in the Boston Red Sox farm system as a second-round pick in what would be the final January draft in MLB. He began his professional career with the Elmira Pioneers, then a Red Sox affiliate. After two and a half years in the minor leagues, Schilling and Brady Anderson were traded to the Baltimore Orioles in 1988 for Mike Boddicker. He debuted in the Major League with the Orioles (1988‚Äì1990), and then spent one year with the Houston Astros (1991). Schilling was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, in exchange for Jason Grimsley, on April 2, 1992. =Phillies (1992‚Äì2000)= 1997 Philadelphia Phillies #38 Curt Schilling road jersey After having struggled with the Orioles and Astros, Schilling was given the chance to pitch and start with the Philadelphia Phillies on a regular basis and flourished as the ace of the Phillies staff, leading the team in wins (14), ERA (2.35), strikeouts (147) and shutouts (4) in his first season with them in 1992. During the Phillies' pennant run in 1993, Schilling went 16‚Äì7 with a 4.02 ERA and 186 strikeouts. Schilling led the Phillies to an upset against the two-time defending National League champion Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship Series. Although he received no decisions during his two appearances in the six-game series, Schilling's 1.69 ERA and 19 strikeouts (including the first 5 Braves hitters of Game 1, an NLCS record) were enough to earn him the 1993 NLCS Most Valuable Player Award. The Phillies went on to face the defending world champion Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series. After losing Game 1, he pitched brilliantly in his next start. With the Phillies facing elimination the day after losing a bizarre 15‚Äì14 contest at home in Veterans Stadium, Schilling pitched a five-hit shutout that the Phillies won, 2‚Äì0. Schilling was named to the NL All-Star team in 1997, 1998, and 1999 and started the 1999 game. In 1997, he finished 14th in NL MVP voting and fourth in NL Cy Young voting. During this season he set the Phillies single-season strikeout record with 319, surpassing the previous record of 310 strikeouts set by Steve Carlton whom had held the record since 1972. Schilling either led or tied for the Phillies leader in wins, complete games, shutouts, and ERA among starters each season from 1997 to 1999, averaging 16 wins per season over those three years despite the team never finishing the season with a winning record. Unhappy with the team's performance, he requested a trade to a more competitive team in 2000 and was subsequently dealt to the Arizona Diamondbacks. His 101 career victories ranks sixth all-time for Phillies pitchers, 20th in ERA (3.35), 23rd in games appeared in (242), sixth in games started (226), 34th in complete games (61), 13th in shutouts (14), fourth in strikeouts (1554), and eighth in innings pitched (1659.1). =Diamondbacks (2000‚Äì2003)= Schilling was traded to the Diamondbacks on July 26, 2000, for first baseman Travis Lee and pitchers Vicente Padilla, Omar Daal, and Nelson Figueroa. With Arizona, he went 22‚Äì6 with a 2.98 ERA in 2001, leading the majors in wins and innings pitched. He also went 4‚Äì0 with a 1.12 ERA in the playoffs. In the 2001 World Series, the Diamondbacks beat the New York Yankees in seven games. Schilling was 1‚Äì0 in that World Series with a 1.69 ERA and 26 strikeouts in 21 innings, though he also allowed a go-ahead home run in the 8th inning of Game Seven. He shared the 2001 World Series MVP Award with teammate Randy Johnson (who relieved Schilling in Game Seven and got the win after the Diamondbacks' dramatic ninth-inning comeback). Schilling and Johnson also shared Sports Illustrated magazine's 2001 \\"Sportsmen of the Year\\" award. During the World Series Schilling received two other honors, as he was presented that year's Roberto Clemente and Branch Rickey Awards, the first Arizona Diamondback so honored for either award. In 2002, he went 23‚Äì7 with a 3.23 ERA. He struck out 316 batters while walking 33 in 259.1 innings. On April 7, 2002, Schilling threw a one-hit shutout striking out 17 against the Milwaukee Brewers. Both years he finished second in the Cy Young Award voting to Johnson. Schilling finished the 2003 season with an 8‚Äì9 record and a 2.95 ERA in 168 innings while striking out 194 batters. In November 2003, the Diamondbacks traded Schilling to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Jorge de la Rosa, Casey Fossum, Mike Goss, and Brandon Lyon. =Red Sox (2004‚Äì2008)= Curt Schilling on the mound Pitchers Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, √âric Gagn√©, pitching coach John Farrell and Schilling prior to a Red Sox game at Safeco Field Commissioner's Trophy during the Red Sox 2007 World Series Parade. The trade to Boston reunited Schilling with Terry Francona, his manager during his final four years with the Philadelphia Phillies. On September 16, 2004, Schilling won his 20th game of 2004 for the Red Sox, becoming the fifth Boston pitcher to win 20 or more games in his first season with the team, and the first since Hall of Famer Dennis Eckersley in 1978. Schilling ended his regular season with a 21‚Äì6 record. On October 19, 2004, Schilling won Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. Notably, he won this game playing on an injured ankle‚Äîthe same injuries that contributed to his disastrous outing in Game 1 of the ALCS. These injuries were so acute that by the end of his Game 6 performance, blood visibly soaked part of his white sock, which is now referred to as \\"the bloody sock\\". The victory forced a Game 7, which the Red Sox would go on to win to capture the pennant and make their first World Series appearance since 1986. Schilling pitched (and won) Game 2 of the 2004 World Series for the Red Sox against the St. Louis Cardinals. In both series, he had to have the tendon in his right ankle stabilized repeatedly, in what has become known as the Schilling tendon procedure, after the tendon sheath was torn during his Game 1 ALDS appearance against the Anaheim Angels. As in Game 6 of the ALCS, Schilling's sock was soaked with blood from the sutures used in this medical procedure, but he still managed to pitch seven strong innings, giving up one run on four hits and striking out four. This second bloody sock was placed in the Baseball Hall of Fame after Boston's victory over St. Louis in the World Series. A four-game sweep of the World Series erased the Curse of the Bambino. On February 23, 2013, the first bloody sock was sold at a live auction at the Fletcher- Sinclair Mansion for $92,613 to an anonymous bidder. Schilling was once again runner-up in Cy Young voting in 2004, this time to Minnesota Twins hurler Johan Santana, who was a unanimous selection, receiving all 28 first-place votes. Schilling received 27 of the 28 second-place votes. Later, the entire Red Sox team was named Sports Illustrated's 2004 Sportsmen of the Year, making Schilling only the second person to have won or shared that award twice. Schilling began 2005 on the disabled list due to recurrent ankle injuries. He returned in July as Boston's closer. He eventually returned to the starting rotation and continued to struggle. The Red Sox made it to the playoffs, but were swept by the Chicago White Sox in three games. For the 2006 season, Schilling was said to be healthy. He began the season 4‚Äì0 with a 1.61 ERA. He finished the year with a 15‚Äì7 record and 198 strikeouts, with a respectable 3.97 ERA. On May 27, he earned his 200th career win, the 104th major league pitcher to accomplish the feat. On August 30, Schilling collected his 3,000th strikeout. Schilling has the highest ratio of strikeouts to walks of any pitcher with at least 3,000 strikeouts, and is one of four pitchers to reach the 3,000-K milestone before reaching 1,000 career walks. The other three who accomplished this feat are Fergie Jenkins, Greg Maddux, and former Boston Red Sox ace and teammate Pedro Mart√≠nez. In January 2007, Schilling announced on the Dennis and Callahan show that after talking with his family, he had changed his mind and did not want to retire at the conclusion of the 2007 season. He sought to negotiate an extension to his current contract, but Red Sox executives announced that they would not negotiate with him until after the season citing Schilling's age and physical condition as factors in their decision. Schilling went on to say he would become a free agent at the end of the season, for the first time in his career, and would not negotiate with the Red Sox during the 15 days after the end of the World Series when the team has exclusive negotiating rights with potential free agents. On a June appearance on the Dennis and Callahan Show, Schilling stated he would accept a one-year extension to his contract at his current salary if the Red Sox offered it to him. Questioned on his statement, Schilling said, \\"I said I wouldn't negotiate a deal during the season, and I'm saying that now. But I would accept that offer.\\" On June 7, 2007, Schilling came within one out of his first career no- hitter. Schilling gave up a two-out single to Oakland's Shannon Stewart, who lined a 95-mph fastball to right field for the A's only hit. Schilling followed up his one-hitter with two poor starts and was sent back to Boston on June 20 for an MRI on his shoulder and was placed on the disabled list. He returned from the disabled list on August 6, pitching at least six innings in each of his nine starts following the All-Star break. Schilling continued his career postseason success in 2007, throwing seven shutout innings in a 9‚Äì1 victory over the Angels in the ALDS, wrapping up a three-game sweep for Boston. However, he did not fare as well pitching in Game 2 of the ALCS against Cleveland, surrendering nine hits‚Äîtwo of them home runs‚Äîand five earned runs in just 4 innings. He did start again in the sixth game of the series, pitching seven complete innings during which he recorded five strikeouts, surrendering no walks with only two earned runs to gain the victory and force a Game 7. He earned his third win of the 2007 playoffs in Game 2 of the 2007 World Series leaving after 5 innings, striking out four while allowing only four hits. With this win, he became only the second pitcher over the age of 40 to start and win a World Series game (Kenny Rogers became the first just one year prior). As Schilling departed in the 6th inning, fans at Fenway Park gave Schilling a standing ovation. Schilling filed for free agency on October 30, 2007. He said he would seek a one-year deal, and according to ESPN First Take and his own blog page 38 Pitches. Schilling later signed a one-year deal with the Boston Red Sox for the 2008 season. Schilling missed all of the 2008 season because of a shoulder injury. The injury was first revealed in February 2008 and the treatment options became a point of contention between Schilling and the Red Sox management. On March 13, 2008, the Red Sox placed Schilling on the 60-day disabled list as he continued to rehabilitate his right shoulder. On June 18, 2008, Curt Schilling left the team to be reevaluated after suffering pain when throwing off the mound. On June 20, 2008 Schilling stated on WEEI's Dennis and Callahan show that he would undergo season-ending surgery and that he had possibly thrown the last pitch of his career. On June 23, 2008, Schilling underwent biceps surgery, during which a small undersurface tear on the rotator cuff was discovered and stitched, and a separation of the labrum was repaired. According to his surgeon, he could begin throwing in four months. =Retirement and honors= On March 23, 2009, Schilling officially announced his retirement from professional baseball after 20 seasons. Schilling ended his career with a 216‚Äì146 record, 3.46 ERA and 3116 strikeouts, 15th-most in MLB history. He was selected to the Boston Red Sox hall of fame in 2012. Having last pitched in 2007, Schilling became eligible for the 2013 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, but he did not receive sufficient votes for election, receiving 38.8% of the vote. On August 2, 2013, Schilling was inducted into the Philadelphia Phillies Wall of Fame. In 2019 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, Schilling's support increased to 60.9%.https://twitter.com/MarkZuckerman/status/1087853148121767944 In 2020 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, announced on January 21, 2020, Schilling appeared on 70% of the ballots cast, falling five percent short of the 75% election threshold. It was his eighth of a maximum 10 times appearing on the BBWAA ballot. =Scouting report= During the prime of his career, Schilling was capable of reaching and sustaining speeds of 94‚Äì98 mph on his four-seam fastball. Throughout his career, he was characterized by a determination to go deep into ballgames, routinely pitching past the sixth and seventh innings. He combined his endurance with pinpoint control, especially on his fastball. Schilling's \\"out\\" pitch was a split-finger fastball, which he generally located beneath the strike zone (resulting in many swinging strikeouts). He also possessed an above-average changeup, an effective slider, and mixed in an occasional curveball, though he mainly alternated between his fastball and splitter. Though his velocity decreased in later years (to the 89‚Äì93 range on his fastball), his control remained excellent, and he is currently fifth in career strikeout to walk ratio.baseball-reference.com All-time K/BB leaders Awards * Babe Ruth Award (2001) * 2√ó Baseball Digest Pitcher of the Year (2001, 2004) * Branch Rickey Award (2001) * Hutch Award (2001) * Lou Gehrig Memorial Award (1995) * 6√ó MLB All-Star (1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004) * 4√ó MLB Pitcher of the Month (May 1999, May 2001, May 2002, July 2002) * 3√ó MLB Player of the Week (May 27, 2001; August 5, 2001; August 17, 2003) * National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award (1993) * Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame inductee (2013) * Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame inductee (2014) * 2√ó Players Choice Award for NL Outstanding Pitcher (2001, 2002) * Roberto Clemente Award (2001) * 2√ó Sporting News NL Pitcher of the Year (2001, 2002) * Sporting News Sportsman of the Year (2001) * 2√ó Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year (2001, 2004) * 3√ó World Series champion (2001, 2004, 2007) * World Series Most Valuable Player Award (2001) ;Accomplishments * 3√ó 300 strikeouts in one season (1996, 1997, 2002) * 3,000 strikeout club (2006) * 4√ó NL complete games leader (1996, 1998, 2000, 2001) * MLB hits per nine innings pitched leader (1992) * 3√ó NL games started leader (1997, 1998, 2001) * 2√ó NL innings pitched leader (1998, 2001) * 2√ó NL strikeout leader (1998, 2001) * 5√ó AL/NL strikeout-to-walk ratio leader (2001‚Äì04, 2006) * 2√ó AL/NL walks per nine innings pitched leader (2002, 2006) * 2√ó NL walks plus hits per inning pitched leader (1992, 2002) * 2√ó MLB wins leader (2001, 2004) Personal life Curt Schilling (left) presenting an \\"Above and Beyond Award\\" in 2007. Schilling is one of just 11 players born in the state of Alaska to play Major League Baseball, but considers his family's native Pittsburgh metro area to be home and is a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers.Boston Dirt Dogs: Steel Curt , February 3, 2006 He went to high school in Phoenix, Arizona, attending Shadow Mountain High School. Until 2013, Schilling lived in Medfield, Massachusetts, in Drew Bledsoe's former home. In late 2013, Schilling's 8,000 square foot home in Massachusetts was put on the market with a listing price of $3 million. Various personal belongings, including a golf cart, were also listed for sale. He is married to Shonda Schilling. They have four children: Gehrig (born 1995),Schilling named his son after Lou Gehrig and later that year received the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award. Lou Gehrig Memorial Award ‚Äì Baseball Almanac. Retrieved August 22, 2009. Gabriella (born 1997), Grant (born 1999), and Garrison (born 2002). Schilling is a born-again Christian. He has an extensive collection of World War II memorabilia, including \\"numerous Nazi uniforms with swastikas\\" and \\"uniforms worn by various SS divisions, including Hitler‚Äôs personal bodyguards\\"; Schilling has specified that it is \\"not a Nazi collection. It's a collection of World War II stuff,\\" further stating that he doesn't \\"have a racist bone in (his) body\\".Here‚Äôs Curt Schilling‚Äôs Nazi memorabilia, by Hilary Sargent, at Boston.com; published August 25, 2015; retrieved June 24, 2020 =Cancer= On February 5, 2014, Schilling revealed that he had been diagnosed with and was being treated for throat cancer. On June 25 of that year, Schilling announced that the cancer was in remission. Schilling said his cancer was a result of using smokeless tobacco for 30 years. He also used his experiences to warn Madison Bumgarner, who is also a long-time smokeless tobacco user (a 'dipper'), of the risks of using smokeless tobacco. =Political involvement= Schilling campaigned for President George W. Bush in 2004, while certain members of the ownership of the Red Sox campaigned for the challenger, Senator John Kerry (D). Schilling said he was encouraged to run for Kerry's seat in the U.S. Senate in 2008 as a Republican. However, Schilling was quoted in The Boston Globe as saying that he intended to pitch in 2008, which would preclude a Senate run. He was called to Capitol Hill to testify about steroid use in March 2005, not as a suspected user but rather as a vocal opponent. He has said that Jose Canseco's statistics should be thrown out due to his admitted use of steroids, and has also said that unless he can refute allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs, Roger Clemens should be stripped of the four Cy Young Awards he has won since 1997. On January 29, 2007, Schilling announced in an interview that he would support Senator John McCain, who became the Republican nominee in the 2008 presidential election. In the same interview, he criticized then-presidential candidate and Senator Hillary Clinton (D) for her comments criticizing the war in Iraq. Schilling also turned up on the campaign trail several times stumping for McCain. Schilling was mentioned as a possible candidate for U.S. Senate in the special election in Massachusetts for the seat left vacant by the deceased Senator Ted Kennedy. However, he ruled out a run during his September 24, 2009, appearance on Dennis and Callahan, a popular Boston sports radio talk show. In 2009, Schilling endorsed Scott Brown for the seat. During the campaign, Martha Coakley, the Democratic candidate, referred to Schilling as a Yankee fan. Coakley was ridiculed for the comment; critics said it showed she was out of touch with the Boston community. Schilling joked about the incident: \\"I've been called a lot of things... But never, and I mean never, could anyone ever make the mistake of calling me a Yankee fan. Well, check that, if you didn't know what the hell is going on in your own state, maybe you could.\\" In a Fox News interview on January 18, 2010, Schilling was asked about his own political ambitions. He said that it was not time. Schilling opposes same-sex marriage, but believes that each state should decide the issue. Schilling supported Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. Schilling joined Breitbart News and has his own show. Schilling had announced that he would challenge Senator Elizabeth Warren in the 2018 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, but ended up dropping out and supported Shiva Ayyadurai in the race. Schilling has also expressed interest in running for President in 2024 if Donald Trump is re-elected in 2020. =Charity work= Schilling is a supporter of care for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) sufferers. His organization, Curt's Pitch for ALS, allows fans and organizations to sponsor him, donating to the ALS Association for every strikeout he throws. He also donated to the charity his $25,000 winnings in a celebrity version of Jeopardy! that originally aired on November 9, 2006. In the 2004 playoffs, after the operation on his ankle, Schilling wrote \\"K ALS\\" (short for \\"strike out ALS\\") on his shoe, knowing that the cameras would be focusing on his foot numerous times while he was pitching. He also does a weekly radio show with WEEI-FM in Boston that raises over $100,000 each year for ALS patients and research. =Conflicts with players= Schilling is known for being outspoken and this has resulted in several conflicts with fellow players. Schilling was publicly criticized by Phillies teammates Mitch Williams, Larry Andersen and Danny Jackson for his conduct during the 1993 World Series. Whenever Mitch Williams (a hard-throwing closer with a penchant for unpredictability and erratic control) was on the mound, CBS television cameras caught Schilling in the dugout hiding his face with a towel. Although Schilling said he was nervous in the heat of the World Series, his teammates criticized him for being disrespectful. Schilling has also directed comments toward Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez, once calling Rodr√≠guez's swat of a tag in Game 6 of the ALCS a \\"bush-league play\\" on The Jim Rome Show. During a radio show appearance on May 8, 2007, Schilling criticized Barry Bonds, stating: \\"He admitted to cheating on his wife, cheating on his taxes and cheating on the game.\\" Soon after, Schilling issued an apology on his blog, stating \\"it was absolutely irresponsible and wrong to say what I did,\\" without, however, indicating his opinion on the statements' veracity. After the 2008 season, Schilling released a blog post blasting former-Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez's conduct before Ramirez left the team. =Conflicts with management= While with the Phillies, Schilling was a vocal critic of team management, stopping just short of calling the front office incompetent. During a game as a Diamondback in 2003, he damaged a QuesTec camera with a bat. According to Schilling, the umpire behind the plate had said \\"I can't call that pitch a strike, the machine won't let me.\\" This led to a fine and a public exchange of insults with Major League Baseball executive Sandy Alderson who accused Schilling of whining and wanting balls to be called strikes. In response Schilling said Alderson was \\"ignorant to the facts and ignorant about what I said.\\" =Conflicts with media= Schilling has a longstanding feud with ESPN and former Arizona Republic reporter Pedro Gomez, initially over an article he wrote concerning manager Buck Showalter. Gomez then published a column critical of Schilling, the same day Schilling was pitching in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series. In his column, Gomez stated, \\"During the past few days, the country ... has discovered Schilling's little secret, the one baseball insiders have known for years but has rarely surfaced into the mainstream. Schilling is something of a con man, someone more intent on polishing his personal image through whatever means possible.\\" He is also quoted later as saying Schilling was \\"the consummate table for one.\\" A year later he further incensed Schilling by stating that the friendship between Schilling and teammate Randy Johnson \\"was merely cosmetic.\\" In interviews in October 2004 and February 2006, Schilling said about Gomez: > There are a lot of [bad people] in that industry, Pedro Gomez, Joel Heyman, > to name a few. People with so little skill in their profession that they > need to speculate, make up, fabricate, to write something interesting enough > to be printed. What makes them bad people? I am sure I cannot nail the exact > reason, but I know some. Jealousy, bitterness, the need to be 'different,' I > am sure there are others, but those are the ones I know off hand ... You > just kind of have to realize that there are people that don't like you and, > unfortunately, sometimes those people have a voice, disliking me probably > matches my dislike for him (Gomez), but I have a problem with people who > don't have integrity and principle, so that stuff happens. You just kind of > just have to let it go. In 2007, Schilling engaged in another war of words with a writer, this time with Boston Globe sports columnist Dan Shaughnessy. Shaughnessy in his column and during television appearances has criticized Schilling for the condition he showed up in for spring training, referred to him as \\"the Big Blowhard\\" and mocked Schilling's blog and radio appearances. Schilling has responded by using the Sons of Sam Horn forum and his own blog to point out errors in Shaughnessy's columns. On April 27, 2007, broadcaster Gary Thorne said that he overheard Red Sox catcher Doug Mirabelli say that the blood on the sock used by Schilling in Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS was actually paint. Mirabelli accused Thorne of lying and a day later, after talking to Mirabelli, Thorne backed off his statement saying he misinterpreted what was intended as a joke, \\"Having talked with him today, there's no doubt in my mind that's not what he said, that's not what he meant. He explained that it was in the context of the sarcasm and the jabbing that goes on in the clubhouse.\\" Schilling responded in his blog by saying the following: > So Gary Thorne says that Doug told him the blood was fake. Which even when > he's called out he can't admit he lied. Doug never told Gary Thorne > anything. Gary Thorne overheard something and then misreported what he > overheard. Not only did he misreport it, he misinterpreted what he > misreported. =Gaming= Schilling plays the board wargame Advanced Squad Leader. > ASL has become his constant companion on road trips, and every National > League city is now his playground for baseball at night and ASL in the day. > (All of which has become a bonanza for ASL players of his acquaintance, who > are sometimes Curt's guests at stadiums around the country.)The General > Magazine, Volume 27, No. 5 Schilling's disappointment at not being able to attend the ASL Oktoberfest (an annual game convention) led him to create his own, The ASL Open, which debuted the weekend of January 15, 1993, in Houston, Texas. The Open was financed out of his own pocket. Schilling also started his own amateur publication entitled Fire for Effect, a bi-monthly featuring \\"some of the ASL hobby's best writers\\". When his favorite game was sold along with Avalon Hill to Hasbro, Schilling joined the small gaming company Multi-Man Publishing which maintained ASL and other Avalon Hill titles. MMP also started a new, professional publication entitled ASL Journal and contributed articles, editorials, and game scenarios. Schilling has played EverQuest and EverQuest II and has reviewed two of the game's many expansion packs for PC Gamer magazine. Schilling has played World of Warcraft and became a regular guest on the World of Warcraft podcast The Instance. In 2006 Schilling created Green Monster Games, which Schilling stated was not named after the Fenway left field wall. In early 2007, the company's name changed to 38 Studios. In January 2008, Schilling announced that he would be focusing on an MMORPG project after his retirement. Comic book creator Todd McFarlane and fantasy author R.A. Salvatore were working with Schilling on the project. The new game was developed under the code-name Copernicus. A single-player RPG set in the same setting, titled Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, was released by his company 38 Studios in February 2012. Executives from 38 Studios introduced the game at the Comic-Con 2010 convention in San Diego. In July 2010, the Rhode Island Board of Economic Development approved a $75 million guaranteed loan to 38 Studios. 38 Studios promised to bring 450 jobs to the state by the end of 2012. In May 2012, 38 Studios defaulted on its loan from the state of Rhode Island and failed to meet payroll obligations to its employees. 38 Studios and its subsidiary, Big Huge Games, then laid off their staffs with a mass email. Some of the laid-off employees may have second mortgages because the company had not actually sold homes for them as part of a relocation package. Some have accused Schilling of hypocrisy based on the conflict between his professed views on \\"big government\\" and the studio's relationship with \\"big government\\". On November 1, 2012, Schilling was sued by the state in connection with the loan. Governor Lincoln Chafee said: \\"My message to Rhode Islanders is this: I know that you work hard for your paychecks, and for your tax dollars to be squandered is unacceptable. The Board's legal action was taken to rectify a grave injustice put upon the people of Rhode Island.\\" In a July 2012 interview, Schilling discussed the downfall of 38 Studios, citing the Rhode Island governor and his own optimism as the primary reasons for the demise of the company. ‚Äì Ultimately, the company filed for bankruptcy; Schilling, other 38 Studios executives and other parties associated with the company agreed in a court settlement to repay the state of Rhode Island $61 million. =Internet= He has a custom avatar in EverQuest II, as the creators of the game have made Schilling a special online character. From June 5 to June 7, 2006, fans were able to battle a virtual Curt Schilling in the game. Every time the virtual Schilling was defeated, Sony Online Entertainment donated $5 towards ALS research. Before the 2007 season, Schilling started a blog called 38pitches.com in which he answered fan questions, documented his starts, and refuted press coverage about him or the team that he believed to be inaccurate. After retiring, he moved his blog to the WEEI sports radio website. After a disagreement with the station, Schilling removed it from that site. Schilling periodically contributes on the ESPN Boston website answering fan questions about the Red Sox or baseball in general. Schilling can also be found on the popular micro-blogging website Twitter under the handle gehrig38. In November 2014, Schilling got into a day-long Twitter argument with baseball writer Keith Law over the creation‚Äìevolution controversy, where he argued for creationism against Law's defense of evolution, after which ESPN decided to suspend Law's Twitter account. ESPN commented that \\"Keith's Twitter suspension had absolutely nothing to do with his opinions on the subject\\", but it remains unclear what other motivation is behind the act, since the conversation between Schilling and Law reportedly \\"never really turned hostile\\", with many reading the details feeling that his suspension was \\"ridiculous\\". Schilling's account was not suspended, and he continued to tweet. Returning to Twitter after the ban expired, Law's first tweet \\"Eppur si muove\\" (\\"And yet it moves\\") made clear that Schilling's complaints about his posts contradicting his argument were in fact the reason for the suspension. On February 25, 2015, Schilling posted a congratulatory tweet to his then-17-year-old daughter Gabby for her acceptance to college and the school's softball team. Some responses to his tweet made crude references to rape, fisting and anal sex, among other sexual references. Schilling posted to his blog screen captures of some offending tweets, along with the real identities of the Twitter handles, whose jobs, schools and relatives he claimed to have contacted. At least two of the Twitter users were known to have been punished, with one losing his part-time job as a ticket seller for the Yankees, and still another being suspended from Brookdale Community College. Schilling claimed at least seven others were also penalized by their jobs or athletic teams. =Public speaking= Schilling was selected as the commencement speaker for Worcester Polytechnic Institute's 2010 commencement and awarded a Doctorate of Science, honoris causa. =Broadcast analyst= Schilling debuted on ESPN as a baseball color analyst on April 4, 2010, on the pre-game show for the 2010 season opener between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. He has written for WEEI.com, 38pitches.com, and WordPress.com. In 2014, he was named as an analyst for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball, although his subsequent cancer diagnosis prevented him from working the telecasts for most of the season. On September 14, 2014, Schilling returned to the Sunday Night Baseball booth as the Yankees played the Baltimore Orioles. On August 25, 2015, ESPN.com suspended Schilling's coverage of the ongoing Little League World Series and Sunday Night Baseball after he posted a Twitter meme that compared Muslim Jihadism and German Nazis, \\"the math is staggering when you get to the true [number]s\\". Schilling deleted and apologized for the controversial tweet the same day. Schilling was also suspended from the next Sunday night game, in which Chicago Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta threw a no-hitter. On September 3, 2015, ESPN announced his suspension would cover all remaining 2015 Sunday Night Baseball games as well as its 2015 MLB playoff coverage.https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/espn-suspends-curt-schilling-for- rest-of-2015-season/ On April 20, 2016, ESPN announced that they had fired Schilling after he shared an \\"anti-transgender\\" Facebook post, saying, \\"ESPN is an inclusive company. Curt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated.\\" Schilling's social media post came shortly after passage of the North Carolina transgender restroom law. In September 2017, Schilling accused ESPN of a double standard when reporter Jemele Hill was not fired or suspended following a controversial social media post about Donald Trump. In an on-air phone interview with CNN, Schilling defended Hill's right to speak her mind, then stated, \\"I wasn't fired for speaking my mind; I was fired for being a conservative.\\" See also * 100 Inning Game ‚Äì annual event to raise funds for Curt's Pitch for ALS * List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders References External links Curt Schilling at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Curt Schilling at Baseball Gauge *Curt Schilling at Astros Daily * 1966 births American Christian creationists American League wins champions American League All-Stars Arizona Diamondbacks players Baltimore Orioles players Baseball players from Alaska Baseball players from Arizona Boston Red Sox players Breitbart News people Cancer survivors Charlotte Knights players Clearwater Phillies players Collectors Elmira Pioneers players Greensboro Hornets players Houston Astros players Living people Major League Baseball broadcasters Major League Baseball pitchers Massachusetts Republicans National League All-Stars National League Championship Series MVPs National League strikeout champions National League wins champions New Britain Red Sox players Pawtucket Red Sox players Pennsylvania Republicans People from Medfield, Massachusetts People in the video game industry Philadelphia Phillies players Reading Phillies players Rochester Red Wings players Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons players Sportspeople from Anchorage, Alaska Tucson Sidewinders players Tucson Toros players World Series Most Valuable Player Award winners Yavapai Roughriders baseball players ","title":"Curt Schilling"},{"id":"241657","text":"The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is a software license originally written for the LaTeX system. Software distributed under the terms of the LPPL can be regarded as free software; however, it is not copylefted. Besides the LaTeX base system, the LPPL is also used for most third-party LaTeX packages. Software projects other than LaTeX rarely use it. Unique features of the license The LPPL grew from Donald Knuth's original license for TeX, which states that the source code for TeX may be used for any purpose but a system built with it can only be called 'TeX' if it strictly conforms to his canonical program. The incentive for this proviso was to ensure that documents written for TeX will be readable for the foreseeable future and TeX and its extensions will still compile documents written from the early 1980s to produce output exactly as intended. Quoting Frank Mittelbach, the main author of the license: \\"LPPL attempts to preserve the fact that something like LaTeX is a language which is used for communication, that is if you write a LaTeX document you expect to be able to send it to me and to work at my end like it does at yours\\". The most unusual part of the LPPL and equally the most controversial used to be the 'filename clause': You must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file. This feature made some people deny that the LPPL is a free software license. In particular the Debian community considered in 2003 excluding LaTeX from its core distribution because of this. However, version 1.3 of the LPPL has weakened this restriction.

A connoisseur (French traditional, pre-1835, spelling of , from Middle-French , then meaning 'to be acquainted with' or 'to know somebody/something') is a person who has a great deal of knowledge about the fine arts; who is a keen appreciator of cuisines, fine wines, and other gourmet products; or who is an expert judge in matters of taste. In many areas, the term now has an air of pretension, and may be used in a partly ironic sense. In the art trade, however, expert connoisseurship remains a crucial skill for the identification and attribution to individual artists of works by the style and technique, where documentary evidence of provenance is lacking. The situation in the wine trade is similar, for example in assessing the potential for ageing in a young wine through wine tasting. Connoisseurship in art \\"The ability to tell almost instinctively who painted a picture is defined ... as connoisseurship\\". Connoisseurs evaluate works of art on the basis of their experience of the style and technique of artists. Judgment informed by intuition is essential, but it must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the work itself. On the basis of empirical evidence, refinement of perception about technique and form, and a disciplined method of analysis, the responsibility of the connoisseur is to attribute authorship, validate authenticity and appraise quality. These findings are crucial for the valuation of works, and can be collected and organized into a catalogue raisonn√© of the work of a single artist or a school. In his Meaning in the Visual Arts (1955), Erwin Panofsky explains the difference between a connoisseur and an art historian: \\"The connoisseur might be defined as a laconic art historian, and the art historian as a loquacious connoisseur.\\" The English dealer and art historian, Philip Mould says, \\"it is about noticing things which have specific characteristics of the artists involved, as opposed to general characteristics of the era\\". He points out the importance of condition and understanding what the artist originally painted (as opposed to how the painting now looks). His colleague, Bendor Grosvenor takes the view that connoisseurship is learned by looking at paintings and cannot be taught in the classroom. He believes that it has become unfashionable in the world of art history and as a result, activities such as producing a catalogue raisonn√© are undervalued by the art history establishment. Svetlana Alpers confirms the art historians reservations that the identification of individual style in works is \\"essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as conoisseurs\\".Alpers, Svetlana, \\"Style is What You Make It\\", p. 139, in The Concept of Style, ed. Berel Lang, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), 137-162, google books Nonetheless, Christie's Education offers an MA in the History of Art and the Art Market that includes a seminar on connoisseurship. This covers \\"the critical skills needed to look at art, write about art, research and evaluate works, including handling and viewing art objects and visiting artists‚Äô studios, conservation labs and museums.\\" =Earlier views of connoisseurship= During the 18th century, the term was often used as a synonym for a still vaguer man of taste or a pretend critic. In 1760, Oliver Goldsmith said, \\"Painting is and has been and now will someday become the sole object of fashionable care; the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable Society; a well timed shrug, an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour.\\" In 1890, Giovanni Morelli wrote, \\"art connoisseurs say of art historians that they write about what they do not understand; art historians, on their side, disparage the connoisseurs, and only look upon them as the drudges who collect materials for them, but who personally have not the slightest knowledge of the physiology of art.\\" The attributions of painted pottery were an important project to the History of Ancient Art and Classical Archeology (Ancient Greece and South Italy). Two specialists were the most important authorities in archaeological connoisseurship: John Davidson Beazley (1885-1970) and Arthur Dale Trendall (1909-1995). Connoisseurs in other fields Connoisseur is also used in the context of gastronomy, i.e. in connection with fine food, beer, wine, coffee, tea and many other products whose consumption can be pleasing to the senses.\\"Connaisseur\\" in its original French See also *Amateur, dilettante *Appraiser *Collector *Enthusiast *Expert *Fan, aficionado *Gourmet, gourmand *Sommelier References Further reading *Beck, James H., From Duccio to Raphael: Connoisseurship in Crisis (Fucecchio: European Press Academic Publishing, 2006). *Friedl√§nder, Max J., On Art and Connoisseurship, trans.

Located adjacent to the Royal Exhibition Building, it is the largest museum in the Southern Hemisphere. The museum was opened in 2000 as a project of the Government of Victoria, on behalf of Museums Victoria who administrates the venue. Melbourne museum is a rich response to Melbourne's urban condition, and provides a place for education, history, culture and society to engage with each other in a contemporary setting. It is now an important part of Melbourne's soft infrastructure and is consistently ranked as one of the most popular museums and tourist attractions in Australia, winning 'Best Tourist Attraction' at the Australian Tourism Awards in 2011. In addition to its galleries, the museum features spaces such as Curious?, which is a place to meet staff and find answers relating to the collections, research and behind-the-scenes work of Museums Victoria; as well as a cafe and a gift shop. The back-of-house areas are home to some of Museums Victoria's State Collections, which holds over 17 million items including objects relating to Indigenous Australian and Pacific Islander cultures, geology, historical studies, palaeontology, technology & society, and zoology, as well as a library collection that holds some of Australia's rarest and finest examples of 18th and 19th century scientific monographs and serials. The world's largest IMAX Theatre screen, which is also part of the museum complex, shows movies and documentary films in large-screen 3-D format. Description The Melbourne Museum is a post-modernist building designed by Denton Corker Marshall Architects. Construction was managed by Baulderstone Hornibrook and completed in 2001, with the museum's official opening in 2000. The building features a grid-like order that embraces eccentric metal clad forms extruding out and creating an irregular sculptural composition with moments of abstract colour throughout the building. The museum is arranged in an individual layout, referencing Melbourne's iconic Hoddle Grid, which allows the importance of each component of the buildings historical, cultural and social significance to be read in loosely equal hierarchy and individuality.Unknown. (2002). Denton Corker Marshall: Melbourne Museum, Melbourne, Australia.. GA document. 69, 88 The building can be dissected into different spaces so an individual can navigate through and around the building in an orthogonal manner. It is designed as both a single building and a network of individual buildings integrated into the landscape of the Carlton Gardens. The museum is axially aligned with the adjacent Italianate Royal Exhibition Building and references it, along with the skyscrapers of Melbourne's central business district, with its monumental scale and protruding vertical facets. The sticks and blades that make up the Melbourne Museum are hallmarks of Denton Corker Marshall's architecture. The most prominent element of the building are the two very long, very high, sloping canopies (or blades) that rise up from the centrally placed entrance opposite the north door of the Royal Exhibition Building; each act to guide visitors from the street into the Museum. On the northern side of the building another larger blade-like roof rises up from the centre to the north, a landmark of similar scale to the central Florentine dome of the Royal Exhibition building. Key influences and design approach Melbourne Museum from Nicholson Street approach Denton Corker Marshall specialise in city planning and urban design, and mainly concern their practise with responding to social desires. The Melbourne Museum is situated in a precinct adjacent to a large local landmark within a large public park. Contrasted against the neo- classical Royal Exhibition centre, Denton Corker Marshall separates the two with an events plaza, yet connects them again underground with a car park, defining their motto \\"A new connection between the old, the new, past and future.\\"Denton Corker Marshall Pty Ltd , Denton Corker Marshall ‚Äì architecture and urban design, 04/04/12 Their approach to such a prominent part of Melbourne's historical and cultural infrastructure was to bring the past and existing exhibition building, into a new context and attempting to redefine a museums role as a public building.Paul Walker. (2001). Melbourne Museum: DCM's latest. Architecture Australia. 90, 44 Denton Corker Marshall also envision the building to be just as responsive to its context as it is now, in the future. In a meeting place for community, the building itself acts as a community of different programs and meanings, combining to make a whole. In a wider context, the museum refers to Melbourne's city grid in its planning, and integrates the landscape of Carlton Gardens, housing a Forest Gallery which is situated within the building, and also providing areas of exterior circulation around the building. Formally the Melbourne Museum is motivated by sculpture. Denton Corker Marshall manipulates sculptural forms to meet the constraints of the buildings context and program.Haig Beck and Jackie Cooper. (2002). Melbourne Museum. UME. 14, 53 Children's area of Melbourne Museum Forest Gallery on northern face of Melbourne Museum  History  The museum had its earliest beginnings in the Government Assay Office which on 9 March 1854, opened some displays in La Trobe Street. In 1858, Prof. Frederick McCoy (Sir Frederick from 1891), who was Professor of Natural History at the University of Melbourne, was appointed Director of the National Museum. Melbourne Museum was originally located (along with the State Library and the old state gallery) in the city block between La Trobe, Swanston, Little Lonsdale and Russell Streets - the nearby Museum underground railway station was originally named after it, although following the move the station was renamed Melbourne Central. The State Library now uses all the space in that building, the gallery also having moved to the NGV site in St Kilda Road. The period in which the Victorian government was led by the Premier Sir Rupert Hamer (1972‚Äì1981) was one of policy development for museums in Victoria. Hamer's Arts Minister the Hon. Norman Lacy established a Museums Development Committee consisting of representatives of the Science Museum of Victoria, the National Museum of Victoria and the Ministry for the Arts. It considered such matters as the development of a single City Museum complex (leading eventually to the establishment of the new Melbourne Museum in Carlton) and programs in fields such as social history. The committee also joined with a working party of the Victorian Council of the Arts to develop a comprehensive museums policy for Victoria. Lacy also began the establishment of the Heide Museum of Modern Art with the acquisition of the property Heide II (in Bulleen east of Melbourne) and a collection of 113 art works from John and Sunday Reed in August 1980. It was officially opened in November 1981. He also developed a proposal for a Museum of Social and Political History at the Old Treasury Building for the Executive Committee of Victoria's 150th Anniversary Celebrations in July 1981 which led to the establishment of the City Museum. The new Melbourne Museum next to the Exhibition Building in Carlton was constructed during the period of the Kennett government (1992‚Äì1999) was opened on 21 October 2000 by the Premier of Victoria at the time The Hon. Steve Bracks. The new Melbourne Museum included some significant changes to the historic methods of interpretation. One notable change was the inclusion of living organisms within the galleries. The centerpiece of the new building houses the Forest Gallery; a massive living and breathing exhibition offering a window into the tall forests of eastern Victoria. The Forest Gallery is home to the ongoing Forest Secrets exhibition which examines the agents of change within the forests. It includes hundreds of living plants and live animals such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. In 2004 Melbourne Museum took another unique step for an Australian museum and created the permanent Bugs Alive! exhibition. This ground breaking exhibition showcases the roles and life- cycles of the critically important animal group - the invertebrates. It features 50 living displays with an even greater number of species. The new Melbourne Museum is located on the site of the former Melbourne Exhibition Speedway which operated from 5 November 1928 until 7 March 1936. The dirt track speedway took place on a track laid out on the former sports oval and generally catered to motorcycle Solo and Sidecar racing and is considered to be the birthplace of Sidecar speedway racing. The inaugural Australian Sidecar Speedway Championship was staged there in 1931 and was won by Victorians Les Medlycott and \\"Tich\\" Jones. The Exhibition Speedway also hosted the Victorian Solo Championship from 1928/29 until 1934/35.

Past Touring Hall exhibitions include 'Hatching the Past: Dinosaur Eggs and Babies' (30 May 2008 to 24 August 2008), 'The Great Wall of China: Dynasties, dragons and warriors' (23 March 2007 to 22 July 2007), 'Spirit of the Games: the Opening Ceremony revealed' (18 March to 23 July 2006) and 'Dinosaurs from China' (2005). * Public spaces - Outside the main galleries are various displays relating to Victoria's and Australia's history, including CSIRAC (an early computer built in Australia) and a pygmy blue whale.  Festival Melbourne 2006  Melbourne Museum was one of the venues of Festival Melbourne 2006, a citywide art festival held in conjunction of the 2006 Commonwealth Games, which was held in Melbourne. Among the exhibitions held in the museum were 'Common Goods:Cultures Meet Through Craft', which featured crafts made by artists from various Commonwealth countries and 'CARVE:Indigenous carving practices', a series of demonstrations of traditional indigenous carving practices and techniques from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Besides that, there was a producers' market, 'Victorian Producers' Market', where the best produces from regional Victoria such as wine, cheese and others were sold. A cooking competition, 'Culinary Pro Am of the Commonwealth' was also held between top Melbourne chefs, each representing a Commonwealth country. Another crowd drawer was the large screen on museum grounds where live actions of the Games were shown. Awards The Melbourne Museum was one of Denton Corker Marshall's award-winning projects. One award in particular was the RACV Award for major tourist attraction, where it received 1,428,238 visitors during the years 2010‚Äì2011, which the Melbourne Museum received top honours for. In March 2012, the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards will be held in Cairns, where the Melbourne Museum will be represented for Victoria as a national level.Unknown author, (16/11/11) Melbourne Museum wins Tourism Award Melbourne Museum's Science and Life gallery was honoured with the Large Permanent Exhibition Award due to its outstanding design and flow, among many other awards during 2010‚Äì2011.Unknown author, (21/11/11) Museum Victoria, , 17/04/12 Their accomplishments have given them a place in numerous awards, being honoured for their high design quality throughout their international practises.

He spoke and wrote about a variety of subjects, including psychedelic drugs, plant-based entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language, philosophy, culture, technology, environmentalism, and the theoretical origins of human consciousness. He was called the \\"Timothy Leary of the '90s\\", \\"one of the leading authorities on the ontological foundations of shamanism\\", and the \\"intellectual voice of rave culture\\". McKenna formulated a concept about the nature of time based on fractal patterns he claimed to have discovered in the I Ching, which he called novelty theory, proposing this predicted the end of time, and a transition of consciousness in the year 2012. His promotion of novelty theory and its connection to the Maya calendar is credited as one of the factors leading to the widespread beliefs about 2012 eschatology. Novelty theory is considered pseudoscience. Biography =Early life= A 2006 photograph of Paonia, Colorado, where McKenna was born Terence McKenna was born and raised in Paonia, Colorado, with Irish ancestry on his father's side of the family. McKenna developed a hobby of fossil-hunting in his youth and from this he acquired a deep scientific appreciation of nature. He also became interested in psychology at a young age, reading Carl Jung's book Psychology and Alchemy at the age of 10. This was the same age McKenna first became aware of magic mushrooms, when reading an essay titled \\"Seeking the Magic Mushroom\\" which appeared in the May 13, 1957 edition of LIFE magazine. At age 16 McKenna moved to Los Altos, California to live with family friends for a year. He finished high school in Lancaster, California. In 1963, he was introduced to the literary world of psychedelics through The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell by Aldous Huxley and certain issues of The Village Voice which published articles on psychedelics. McKenna said that one of his early psychedelic experiences with morning glory seeds showed him \\"that there was something there worth pursuing\\", and in interviews he claimed to have smoked cannabis daily since his teens. =Studying and traveling= In 1965, McKenna enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley and was accepted into the Tussman Experimental College. In 1967, while in college, he discovered and began studying shamanism through the study of Tibetan folk religion. That same year, which he called his \\"opium and kabbala phase\\" he traveled to Jerusalem, where he met Kathleen Harrison, an ethnobotanist who would later become his wife. In 1969, McKenna traveled to Nepal led by his interest in Tibetan painting and hallucinogenic shamanism. He sought out shamans of the Tibetan Bon tradition, trying to learn more about the shamanic use of visionary plants. During his time there, he also studied the Tibetan language and worked as a hashish smuggler, until \\"one of his Bombay-to-Aspen shipments fell into the hands of U. S. Customs.\\" He then wandered through southeast Asia viewing ruins, and spent time as a professional butterfly collector in Indonesia. After his mother's death from cancer in 1970, McKenna, his brother Dennis, and three friends traveled to the Colombian Amazon in search of oo-koo-h√©, a plant preparation containing dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Instead of oo-koo-h√© they found fields full of gigantic Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, which became the new focus of the expedition. In La Chorrera, at the urging of his brother, McKenna was the subject of a psychedelic experiment in which the brothers attempted to bond harmine (harmine is another psychedelic compound they used synergistically with the mushrooms) with their own neural DNA, through the use of a set specific vocal techniques. They hypothesised this would give them access to the collective memory of the human species, and would manifest the alchemists' Philosopher's Stone which they viewed as a \\"hyperdimensional union of spirit and matter\\". McKenna claimed the experiment put him in contact with \\"Logos\\": an informative, divine voice he believed was universal to visionary religious experience. McKenna also often referred to the voice as \\"the mushroom\\", and \\"the teaching voice\\" amongst other names. The voice's reputed revelations and his brother's simultaneous peculiar psychedelic experience prompted him to explore the structure of an early form of the I Ching, which led to his \\"Novelty Theory\\". During their stay in the Amazon, McKenna also became romantically involved with his interpreter, Ev. In 1972, McKenna returned to U.C. Berkeley to finish his studies and in 1975, he graduated with a degree in ecology, shamanism, and conservation of natural resources. In the autumn of 1975, after parting with his girlfriend Ev earlier in the year, McKenna began a relationship with his future wife and the mother of his two children, Kathleen Harrison. Soon after graduating, McKenna and Dennis published a book inspired by their Amazon experiences, The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens and the I Ching. The brothers' experiences in the Amazon would later be the main focus of McKenna's book True Hallucinations, published in 1993. McKenna also began lecturing locally around Berkeley and started appearing on some underground radio stations. =Psilocybin mushroom cultivation= Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide (1986 revised edition) McKenna, along with his brother Dennis, developed a technique for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms using spores they brought to America from the Amazon. In 1976, the brothers published what they had learned in a book entitled Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide, under the pseudonyms \\"O.T. Oss\\" and \\"O.N. Oeric\\". McKenna and his brother were the first to come up with a reliable method for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms at home. As ethnobiologist Jonathan Ott explains, \\"[the] authors adapted San Antonio's technique (for producing edible mushrooms by casing mycelial cultures on a rye grain substrate; San Antonio 1971) to the production of Psilocybe [Stropharia] cubensis. The new technique involved the use of ordinary kitchen implements, and for the first time the layperson was able to produce a potent entheogen in his [or her] own home, without access to sophisticated technology, equipment, or chemical supplies.\\"; see When the 1986 revised edition was published, the Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide had sold over 100,000 copies. =Mid- to later life= Public speaking In the early 1980s, McKenna began to speak publicly on the topic of psychedelic drugs, becoming one of the pioneers of the psychedelic movement. His main focus was on the plant-based psychedelics such as psilocybin mushrooms (which were the catalyst for his career), ayahuasca, cannabis, and the plant derivative DMT. He conducted lecture tours and workshops promoting natural psychedelics as a way to explore universal mysteries, stimulate the imagination, and re-establish a harmonious relationship with nature. Though associated with the New Age and Human Potential Movements, McKenna himself had little patience for New Age sensibilities. He repeatedly stressed the importance and primacy of the \\"felt presence of direct experience\\", as opposed to dogma. In addition to psychedelic drugs, McKenna spoke on a wide array of subjects including; shamanism; metaphysics; alchemy; language; culture; self- empowerment; environmentalism, techno-paganism; artificial intelligence; evolution; extraterrestrials; science and scientism; the Web; virtual reality (which he saw as a way to artistically communicate the experience of psychedelics); and aesthetic theory, specifically about art/visual experience as information representing the significance of hallucinatory visions experienced under the influence of psychedelics. McKenna soon became a fixture of popular counterculture with Timothy Leary once introducing him as \\"one of the five or six most important people on the planet\\" and with comedian Bill Hicks' referencing him in his stand-up act and building an entire routine around his ideas. McKenna also became a popular personality in the psychedelic rave/dance scene of the early 1990s, with frequent spoken word performances at raves and contributions to psychedelic and goa trance albums by The Shamen, Spacetime Continuum, Alien Project, Capsula, Entheogenic, Zuvuya, Shpongle, and Shakti Twins. In 1994 he appeared as a speaker at the Starwood Festival, documented in the book Tripping by Charles Hayes. McKenna published several books in the early-to-mid-1990s including: The Archaic Revival; Food of the Gods; and True Hallucinations. Hundreds of hours of McKenna's public lectures were recorded either professionally or bootlegged and have been produced on cassette tape, CD and MP3. Segments of his talks have gone on to be sampled by many musicians and DJ's. McKenna was a colleague and close friend of chaos mathematician Ralph Abraham, and author and biologist Rupert Sheldrake. He conducted several public and many private debates with them from 1982 until his death. These debates were known as trialogues and some of the discussions were later published in the books: Trialogues at the Edge of the West and The Evolutionary Mind. Botanical Dimensions Botanical Dimensions ethnobotanical preserve in Hawaii. In 1985, McKenna founded Botanical Dimensions with his then-wife, Kathleen Harrison. Botanical Dimensions is a nonprofit ethnobotanical preserve on the Big Island of Hawaii, established to collect, protect, propagate, and understand plants of ethno-medical significance and their lore, and appreciate, study, and educate others about plants and mushrooms felt to be significant to cultural integrity and spiritual well-being. The botanical garden is a repository containing thousands of plants that have been used by indigenous people of the tropical regions, and includes a database of information related to their purported healing properties. McKenna was involved until 1992, when he retired from the project, following his and Kathleen's divorce earlier in the year. Kathleen still manages Botanical Dimensions as its president and projects director. After their divorce, McKenna moved to Hawaii permanently, where he built a modernist house and created a gene bank of rare plants near his home. Previously, he had split his time between Hawaii and Occidental, CA.Terence McKenna during a panel discussion at the 1999 AllChemical Arts Conference, held at Kona, Hawaii. =Death= McKenna was a longtime sufferer of migraines, but on 22 May 1999 he began to have unusually extreme and painful headaches. He then collapsed due to a brain seizure. McKenna was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. For the next several months he underwent various treatments, including experimental gamma knife radiation treatment. According to Wired magazine, McKenna was worried that his tumor may have been caused by his psychedelic drug use, or his 35 years of daily cannabis smoking; however, his doctors assured him there was no causal relation. In late 1999, McKenna described his thoughts concerning his impending death to interviewer Erik Davis: McKenna died on April 3, 2000, at the age of 53. =Library fire and insect collection= On February 7, 2007, McKenna's library of over 3000 rare books and personal notes was destroyed in a fire at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. An index of McKenna's library was made by his brother Dennis. His daughter, the artist and photographer Klea McKenna, subsequently preserved his insect collection, turning it into a gallery installation, and then publishing it in book form as The Butterfly Hunter, featuring her selected photos of 122 insects119 butterflies/moths and three beetles or beetle-like insectsfrom a set of over 2000 he collected between 1969 and 1972, as well as maps showing his collecting routes through the rainforests of Southeast Asia and South America.'The Butterfly Hunter' by Klea McKenna By Tao Lin, Sep 9 2014, 7:36pm, Vice McKenna had intensively studied lepidoptera and entomology in the 1960s, and as part of his studies hunted for butterflies primarily in Colombia and Indonesia. McKenna's insect collection was consistent with his interest in Victorian-era explorers and naturalists, and his worldview based on close observation of nature. In the 1970s, when he was still collecting, he became quite squeamish and guilt-ridden about the necessity of killing butterflies in order to collect and classify them, and that's what led him to stop his entomological studies, according to his daughter. Thought =Psychedelics= Terence McKenna advocated the exploration of altered states of mind via the ingestion of naturally occurring psychedelic substances; for example, and in particular, as facilitated by the ingestion of high doses of psychedelic mushrooms, ayahuasca, and DMT, which he believed was the apotheosis of the psychedelic experience. He was less enthralled with synthetic drugs, stating, \\"I think drugs should come from the natural world and be use-tested by shamanically orientated cultures ... one cannot predict the long-term effects of a drug produced in a laboratory.\\" McKenna always stressed the responsible use of psychedelic plants, saying: > \\"Experimenters should be very careful. One must build up to the experience. > These are bizarre dimensions of extraordinary power and beauty. There is no > set rule to avoid being overwhelmed, but move carefully, reflect a great > deal, and always try to map experiences back onto the history of the race > and the philosophical and religious accomplishments of the species. All the > compounds are potentially dangerous, and all compounds, at sufficient doses > or repeated over time, involve risks. The library is the first place to go > when looking into taking a new compound.\\" He also recommended, and often spoke of taking, what he called \\"heroic doses\\", which he defined as five grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms, taken alone, on an empty stomach, in silent darkness, and with eyes closed. He believed that when taken this way one could expect a profound visionary experience, believing it is only when \\"slain\\" by the power of the mushroom that the message becomes clear. Although McKenna avoided giving his allegiance to any one interpretation (part of his rejection of monotheism), he was open to the idea of psychedelics as being \\"trans-dimensional travel\\". He proposed that DMT sent one to a \\"parallel dimension\\" and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter \\"higher dimensional entities\\", or what could be ancestors, or spirits of the Earth, saying that if you can trust your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an \\"ecology of souls\\". McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were \\"doorways into the Gaian mind\\", suggesting that \\"the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being\\" and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication. ‚Äì Cut-up from the works of Terence McKenna. Machine elves McKenna spoke of hallucinations while on DMT in which he claims to have met intelligent entities he described as, \\"self-transforming machine elves\\". Psilocybin panspermia speculation In a more radical version of biophysicist Francis Crick's hypothesis of directed panspermia, McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence, which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space and which are attempting to establish a symbiotic relationship with human beings. He postulated that \\"intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [to Earth] in this spore-bearing life form\\". He said, \\"I think that theory will probably be vindicated. I think in a hundred years if people do biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that spores could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic radiation pressure,\\" and also believed that \\"few people are in a position to judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed.\\" Opposition to organized religion McKenna was opposed to Christianity and most forms of organized religion or guru-based forms of spiritual awakening, favouring shamanism, which he believed was the broadest spiritual paradigm available, stating that: > What I think happened is that in the world of prehistory all religion was > experiential, and it was based on the pursuit of ecstasy through plants. And > at some time, very early, a group interposed itself between people and > direct experience of the 'Other.' This created hierarchies, priesthoods, > theological systems, castes, ritual, taboos. Shamanism, on the other hand, > is an experiential science that deals with an area where we know nothing. It > is important to remember that our epistemological tools have developed very > unevenly in the West. We know a tremendous amount about what is going on in > the heart of the atom, but we know absolutely nothing about the nature of > the mind. Technological singularity During the final years of his life and career, McKenna became very engaged in the theoretical realm of technology. He was an early proponent of the technological singularity and in his last recorded public talk, Psychedelics in the age of intelligent machines, he outlined ties between psychedelics, computation technology, and humans. He also became enamored with the Internet, calling it \\"the birth of [the] global mind\\", believing it to be a place where psychedelic culture could flourish. Admired writers Either philosophically or religiously, he expressed admiration for Marshall McLuhan, Alfred North Whitehead, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Carl Jung, Plato, Gnostic Christianity, and Alchemy, while regarding the Greek philosopher Heraclitus as his favorite philosopher. McKenna also expressed admiration for the works of writers including Aldous Huxley, James Joyce, whose book Finnegans Wake he called \\"the quintessential work of art, or at least work of literature of the 20th century,\\" science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who he described as an \\"incredible genius,\\" fabulist Jorge Luis Borges, with whom McKenna shared the belief that \\"scattered through the ordinary world there are books and artifacts and perhaps people who are like doorways into impossible realms, of impossible and contradictory truth\\" and Vladimir Nabokov; McKenna once said that he would have become a Nabokov lecturer if he had never encountered psychedelics. =\\"Stoned ape\\" theory of human evolution= In his book Food of the Gods, McKenna proposed that the transformation from humans' early ancestors Homo erectus to the species Homo sapiens mainly had to do with the addition of the mushroom Psilocybe cubensis in its diet, an event that according to his theory took place in about 100,000 BCE (which is when he believed that the species diverged from the genus Homo). McKenna based his theory on the main effects, or alleged effects, produced by the mushroom while citing studies by Roland Fischer et al. from the late 1960s to early 1970s. McKenna stated that due to the desertification of the African continent at that time, human forerunners were forced from the increasingly shrinking tropical canopy in search of new food sources. He believed they would have been following large herds of wild cattle whose dung harbored the insects that, he proposed, were undoubtedly part of their new diet, and would have spotted and started eating Psilocybe cubensis, a dung-loving mushroom often found growing out of cowpats. Psilocybe cubensis: the psilocybin- containing mushroom central to McKenna's \\"stoned ape\\" theory of human evolution. McKenna's hypothesis was that low doses of psilocybin improve visual acuity, particularly edge detection, meaning that the presence of psilocybin in the diet of early pack hunting primates caused the individuals who were consuming psilocybin mushrooms to be better hunters than those who were not, resulting in an increased food supply and in turn a higher rate of reproductive success. Then at slightly higher doses, he contended, the mushroom acts to sexually arouse, leading to a higher level of attention, more energy in the organism, and potential erection in the males, rendering it even more evolutionarily beneficial, as it would result in more offspring. At even higher doses, McKenna proposed that the mushroom would have acted to \\"dissolve boundaries,\\" promoting community bonding and group sexual activities. Consequently, there would be a mixing of genes, greater genetic diversity, and a communal sense of responsibility for the group offspring. At these higher doses, McKenna also argued that psilocybin would be triggering activity in the \\"language-forming region of the brain\\", manifesting as music and visions, thus catalyzing the emergence of language in early hominids by expanding \\"their arboreally evolved repertoire of troop signals.\\" He also pointed out that psilocybin would dissolve the ego and \\"religious concerns would be at the forefront of the tribe's consciousness, simply because of the power and strangeness of the experience itself.\\" Therefore, according to McKenna, access to and ingestion of mushrooms was an evolutionary advantage to humans' omnivorous hunter-gatherer ancestors, also providing humanity's first religious impulse. He believed that psilocybin mushrooms were the \\"evolutionary catalyst\\" from which language, projective imagination, the arts, religion, philosophy, science, and all of human culture sprang. McKenna's hypothesis concerning the influence of psilocybin mushrooms on human evolution is known as \\"the 'stoned ape' theory.\\" In 2019 McKenna's theory was supported by the mycologist Paul Stamets.https://samharris.org/ama-answers/ask- anything-12/ Criticism McKenna's \\"stoned ape\\" theory has not received attention from the scientific community and has been criticized for a relative lack of citation to any of the paleoanthropological evidence informing our understanding of human origins. His ideas regarding psilocybin and visual acuity have been criticized by suggesting he misrepresented Fischer et al., who published studies about visual perception in terms of various specific parameters, not acuity. Criticism has also been expressed due to the fact that in a separate study on psilocybin induced transformation of visual space Fischer et al. stated that psilocybin \\"may not be conducive to the survival of the organism\\". There is also a lack of scientific evidence that psilocybin increases sexual arousal, and even if it does, it does not necessarily entail an evolutionary advantage. Others have pointed to civilisations such as the Aztecs, who used psychedelic mushrooms (at least among the Priestly class), that didn't reflect McKenna's model of how psychedelic-using cultures would behave, for example, by carrying out human sacrifice. Although, it has been noted that psilocybin usage by the Aztec civilisation is far removed from the type of usage on which McKenna was speculating. There are also examples of Amazonian tribes such as the Jivaro and the Yanomami who use ayahuasca ceremoniously and who are known to engage in violent behaviour. This, it has been argued, indicates the use of psychedelic plants does not necessarily suppress the ego and create harmonious societies. =Archaic revival= One of the main themes running through McKenna's work, and the title of his second book, was the idea that Western civilization was undergoing what he called an \\"archaic revival\\". His notion was that Western society has become \\"sick\\" and is undergoing a \\"healing process\\", in the same way that the human body begins to produce antibodies when it feels itself to be sick, humanity as a collective whole (in the Jungian sense) was creating \\"strategies for overcoming the condition of dis-ease\\" and trying to cure itself, by what he termed as \\"a reversion to archaic values.\\" McKenna pointed to phenomena including surrealism, abstract expressionism, body piercing and tattooing, psychedelic drug use, sexual permissiveness, jazz, experimental dance, rave culture, rock and roll and catastrophe theory, amongst others, as his evidence that this process was underway. This idea is linked to McKenna's \\"stoned ape\\" theory of human evolution, with him viewing the \\"archaic revival\\" as an impulse to return to the symbiotic and blissful relationship he believed humanity once had with the psilocybin mushroom. In differentiating his idea from the \\"New Age\\", a term that he felt trivialized the significance of the next phase in human evolution, McKenna stated that: \\"The New Age is essentially humanistic psychology '80s-style, with the addition of neo- shamanism, channeling, crystal and herbal healing. The archaic revival is a much larger, more global phenomenon that assumes that we are recovering the social forms of the late neolithic, and reaches far back in the 20th century to Freud, to surrealism, to abstract expressionism, even to a phenomenon like National Socialism which is a negative force. But the stress on ritual, on organized activity, on race/ancestor-consciousness ‚Äì these are themes that have been worked out throughout the entire 20th century, and the archaic revival is an expression of that.\\" =Novelty theory and Timewave Zero= Novelty theory is a pseudoscientific idea that purports to predict the ebb and flow of novelty in the universe as an inherent quality of time, proposing that time is not a constant but has various qualities tending toward either \\"habit\\" or \\"novelty\\". Habit, in this context, can be thought of as entropic, repetitious, or conservative; and novelty as creative, disjunctive, or progressive phenomena. McKenna's idea was that the universe is an engine designed for the production and conservation of novelty and that as novelty increases, so does complexity. With each level of complexity achieved becoming the platform for a further ascent into complexity. The 64 hexagrams from the King Wen sequence of the I Ching. The basis of the theory was originally conceived in the mid-1970s after McKenna's experiences with psilocybin mushrooms at La Chorrera in the Amazon led him to closely study the King Wen sequence of the I Ching. In Asian Taoist philosophy the concept of opposing phenomena is represented by the yin and yang. Both are always present in everything, yet the amount of influence of each varies over time. The individual lines of the I Ching are made up of both Yin (broken lines) and Yang (solid lines). When examining the King Wen sequence of the 64 hexagrams, McKenna noticed a pattern. He analysed the \\"degree of difference\\" between the hexagrams in each successive pair and claimed he found a statistical anomaly, which he believed suggested that the King Wen sequence was intentionally constructed, with the sequence of hexagrams ordered in a highly structured and artificial way, and that this pattern codified the nature of time's flow in the world. With the degrees of difference as numerical values, McKenna worked out a mathematical wave form based on the 384 lines of change that make up the 64 hexagrams. He was able to graph the data and this became the Novelty Time Wave. A screenshot of the Timewave Zero software (written by Peter J. Meyer) showing the timewave for the 25 years preceding a zero date of December 21, 2012. Peter J. Meyer (Peter Johann Gustav Meyer) (born 1946), in collaboration with McKenna, studied and improved the foundations of novelty theory, working out a mathematical formula and developing the Timewave Zero software (the original version of which was completed by July 1987),United States Copyright Office Title=Timewave zero. Copyright Number: TXu000288739 Date: 1987 enabling them to graph and explore its dynamics on a computer. The graph was fractal, it exhibited a pattern in which a given small section of the wave was found to be identical in form to a larger section of the wave. McKenna called this fractal modeling of time \\"temporal resonance\\", proposing it implied that larger intervals, occurring long ago, contained the same amount of information as shorter, more recent, intervals. He suggested the up-and-down pattern of the wave shows an ongoing wavering between habit and novelty respectively. With each successive iteration trending, at an increasing level, towards infinite novelty. So according to novelty theory, the pattern of time itself is speeding up, with a requirement of the theory being that infinite novelty will be reached on a specific date. McKenna suspected that notable events in history could be identified that would help him locate the time wave's end date and attempted to find the best-fit placement when matching the graph to the data field of human history. The last harmonic of the wave has a duration of 67.29 years. Population growth, peak oil, and pollution statistics were some of the factors that pointed him to an early twenty-first century end date and when looking for an extremely novel event in human history as a signal that the final phase had begun McKenna picked the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. This worked out to the graph reaching zero in mid-November 2012. When he later discovered that the end of the 13th baktun in the Maya calendar had been correlated by Western Maya scholars as December 21, 2012, he adopted their end date instead. McKenna saw the universe, in relation to novelty theory, as having a teleological attractor at the end of time, which increases interconnectedness and would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity. He also frequently referred to this as \\"the transcendental object at the end of time.\\" When describing this model of the universe he stated that: \\"The universe is not being pushed from behind. The universe is being pulled from the future toward a goal that is as inevitable as a marble reaching the bottom of a bowl when you release it up near the rim. If you do that, you know the marble will roll down the side of the bowl, down, down, down ‚Äì until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact that we are now very, very close to the attractor.\\" Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced. An event he described as a \\"concrescence\\", a \\"tightening 'gyre'\\" with everything flowing together. Speculating that \\"when the laws of physics are obviated, the universe disappears, and what is left is the tightly bound plenum, the monad, able to express itself for itself, rather than only able to cast a shadow into physis as its reflection...It will be the entry of our species into 'hyperspace', but it will appear to be the end of physical laws, accompanied by the release of the mind into the imagination.\\" Novelty theory is considered to be pseudoscience. Among the criticisms are the use of numerology to derive dates of important events in world history, the arbitrary rather than calculated end date of the time wave and the apparent adjustment of the eschaton from November 2012 to December 2012 in order to coincide with the Maya calendar. Other purported dates do not fit the actual time frames: the date claimed for the emergence of Homo sapiens is inaccurate by 70,000 years, and the existence of the ancient Sumer and Egyptian civilisations contradict the date he gave for the beginning of \\"historical time\\". Some projected dates have been criticised for having seemingly arbitrary labels, such as the \\"height of the age of mammals\\" and McKenna's analysis of historical events has been criticised for having a eurocentric and cultural bias. The Watkins Objection The British mathematician Matthew Watkins of Exeter University conducted a mathematical analysis of the Time Wave, and claimed there were various mathematical flaws in its construction. Critical reception One expert on drug treatment attacked McKenna for popularizing \\"dangerous substances\\". Judy Corman, vice president of Phoenix House of New York, a drug treatment center, said in a letter to The New York Times in 1993: \\"Surely the fact that Terence McKenna says that the psilocybin mushroom 'is the megaphone used by an alien, intergalactic Other to communicate with mankind' is enough for us to wonder if taking LSD has done something to his mental faculties.\\" \\"I suffered hallucinatory agonies of my own while reading his shrilly ecstatic prose,\\" Peter Conrad wrote in The New York Times in a 1993 review of Mr. McKenna's book True Hallucinations. Biologist Richard Evans Schultes, of Harvard University, wrote in American Scientist in a 1993 review of McKenna's book Food of the Gods, that it was; \\"a masterpiece of research and writing\\" and that it \\"should be read by every specialist working in the multifarious fields involved with the use of psychoactive drugs.\\" Concluding that \\"It is, without question, destined to play a major role in our future considerations of the role of the ancient use of psychoactive drugs, the historical shaping of our modern concerns about drugs and perhaps about man's desire for escape from reality with drugs.\\" John Horgan in a 2012 blog post for Scientific American also commented that, Food of the Gods was \\"a rigorous argument...that mind-expanding plants and fungi catalyzed the transformation of our brutish ancestors into cultured modern humans.\\" \\"To write him off as a crazy hippie is a rather lazy approach to a man not only full of fascinating ideas but also blessed with a sense of humor and self-parody,\\" Tom Hodgkinson wrote in The New Statesman and Society in 1994. Mark Jacobson said of True Hallucinations, in a 1992 issue of Esquire Magazine that, \\"it would be hard to find a drug narrative more compellingly perched on a baroquely romantic limb than this passionate Tom-and-Huck-ride-great-mother-river-saga of brotherly bonding,\\" adding \\"put simply, Terence is a hoot!\\" Wired called him a \\"charismatic talking head\\" who was \\"brainy, eloquent, and hilarious\\" and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead also said that he was \\"the only person who has made a serious effort to objectify the psychedelic experience.\\" Bibliography   Spoken word * History Ends in Green: Gaia, Psychedelics and the Archaic Revival, 6 audiocassette set, Mystic Fire audio, 1993, (recorded at the Esalen Institute, 1989) * TechnoPagans at the End of History (transcription of rap with Mark Pesce from 1998) * Psychedelics in the Age of Intelligent Machines (1999) (DVD) HPX/SurrealStudio * Conversations on the Edge of Magic (1994) (CD & Cassette) ACE * Rap-Dancing into the Third Millennium (1994) (Cassette) (Re-issued on CD as The Quintessential Hallucinogen) ACE * Packing For the Long Strange Trip (1994) (Audio Cassette) ACE * Global Perspectives and Psychedelic Poetics (1994) (Cassette) Sound Horizons Audio-Video, Inc. * The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge (1992) (Cassette) Sounds True * The Psychedelic Society (DVD & Video Cassette) Sound Photosynthesis * True Hallucinations Workshop (Audio/Video Cassette) Sound Photosynthesis * The Vertigo at History's Edge: Who Are We?

This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and Marc Zender, adhere to the \\"Lounsbury/GMT+2\\" correlation, which sets the start date at August 13 and the end date at December 23. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled. Coe's initial date was \\"24 December 2011.\\" He revised it to \\"11 January AD 2013\\" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book, not settling on December 23, 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.

The Troll A platform is a Condeep gravity-based structure offshore natural gas platform in the Troll gas field off the west coast of Norway. Built from reinforced concrete, , it was the tallest and heaviest structure that has ever been moved to another position, relative to the surface of the Earth, and is among the largest and most complex engineering projects in history. The platform was a televised sensation when it was towed into the North Sea in 1996, where it is now operated by Equinor. Dimensions slip formed gravity-based structure supports under construction in a Norwegian fjord. The tower cranes delivered concrete to the support cylinders during the continuous pour of concrete to create seamless walls. The Troll A platform has an overall height of , weighs 683,600 tons (1.2 million tons with ballast) and has the distinction of being the tallest and heaviest structure ever moved by mankind. The platform stands on four legs extending down to the sea floor 303 metres (994 feet) below the surface of the sea, and the leg containing the import and export risers has an elevator that takes over nine minutes to travel from the platform above the waves to the sea floor. National Geographic Channel production, documentary 2007(?), rebroadcast 2009-10-02, 12-13:00 hrs EDST (Comcast Cable Television system) The legs must be able to withstand intense pressures, so the walls of Troll A's legs are over 1 metre thick and are made of steel-reinforced concrete that was formed in one continuous poura lengthy process that takes 20 minutes per 5 cm laid. Each leg is a mathematically joined composite of several conical cylinders that flares out smoothly to greater diameters at the top and bottom, so each support is somewhat wasp- waisted when viewed in profile and circular in any cross-section (see picture at right). The four legs are joined by a \\"chord shortener\\" (not present in the picture at right), a reinforced concrete box connecting the legs that damps out any potentially destructive wave-leg resonances by retuning the legs' natural frequencies. Each leg is also sub-divided along its length into compartments a third of the way from each end which act as independent water- tight compartments. The legs use groups of six tall vacuum-anchors holding them fixed in the mud of the sea floor. Construction Troll A was built by Norwegian Contractors for Norske Shell, with base construction beginning in July 1991 at a cost of 4150 million NOK, or approximately US$650 million at the time. The base and the deck were built separately, and were joined in 1995 while the base was partially submerged. The base is a Condeep gravity base structure built from reinforced concrete. The Troll platform was towed over from Vats, in the northern part of Rogaland, to the Troll field, north-west of Bergen. The tow took seven days. Expansion In the autumn of 2010 the Troll A platform was expanded with a new module. This module contains living quarters and a new control room. The new control room and expanded facilities are needed to support the new compressors (a third and fourth are planned and being installed in 2014). These compressors are needed due to the dropping reservoir pressure in the wells. On 18 June 2013 the new support module M12 for compressors 3 and 4 was lifted on board Troll A. The increased electricity consumption of these compressors required new power cables from shore, and due to grid constraints the platform is cut off from shore power if a grid emergency arises.√òyvind Lie. \\"Troll A blir B-kunde\\" Teknisk Ukeblad, 27. september 2011. Accessed: 14 November 2013. Operation Gas rises from 40 wells and is exported through a number of pipes to a processing plant at Kollsnes. Troll A is scheduled to receive two additional gas compressors to increase production volume and compensate for dropping reservoir pressure in the wells. World records In 1996, the platform set the Guinness World Record for 'largest offshore gas platform'. In 2006, the 10th anniversary of Statoil's operatorship of Troll gas production was celebrated with a concert by Katie Melua held at the base of one of the hollow legs of the platform. The concert set a new world record for the deepest underwater concert, at below sea level.

The first patent on the submerged-arc welding (SAW) process was taken out in 1935 and covered an electric arc beneath a bed of granulated flux. Originally developed and patented by Jones, Kennedy and Rothermund, the process requires a continuously fed consumable solid or tubular (metal cored) electrode. The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being \\"submerged\\" under a blanket of granular fusible flux consisting of lime, silica, manganese oxide, calcium fluoride, and other compounds. When molten, the flux becomes conductive, and provides a current path between the electrode and the work. This thick layer of flux completely covers the molten metal thus preventing spatter and sparks as well as suppressing the intense ultraviolet radiation and fumes that are a part of the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process. SAW is normally operated in the automatic or mechanized mode, however, semi-automatic (hand- held) SAW guns with pressurized or gravity flux feed delivery are available. The process is normally limited to the flat or horizontal-fillet welding positions (although horizontal groove position welds have been done with a special arrangement to support the flux). Deposition rates approaching 45 kg/h (100 lb/h) have been reported -- this compares to ~5 kg/h (10 lb/h) (max) for shielded metal arc welding. Although currents ranging from 300 to 2000 A are commonly utilized,Kalpakjian, Serope, and Steven Schmid. Manufacturing Engineering and Technology. '5th ed'. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2006. currents of up to 5000 A have also been used (multiple arcs). Single or multiple (2 to 5) electrode wire variations of the process exist. SAW strip-cladding utilizes a flat strip electrode (e.g. 60 mm wide x 0.5 mm thick). DC or AC power can be used, and combinations of DC and AC are common on multiple electrode systems. Constant voltage welding power supplies are most commonly used; however, constant current systems in combination with a voltage sensing wire-feeder are available. Features =Power source= AC (alternate current) or DC (Direct Current) can be used for SAW (Submerged arc welding) welding. For DC a transformer and a rectifier are necessary while for AC only transformer is used. While welding with DC the work pieces (job, metal parts to be welded) are normally connected to negative terminal and the electrode is normally connected to positive terminal. Using DC for welding with electrode connected to negative terminal (DCEN) gives a deep weld penetration, AC provides a medium level of penetration and DC with positive terminal connected to electrode (DCEP) gives low penetration. Current between 300 to 2000 amperes and potential difference of 20 to 48 Volts is suitable for welding. =Welding head= It feeds flux and filler metal to the welding joint. Electrode (filler metal) gets energized here. =Flux hopper= It stores the flux and controls the rate of flux deposition on the welding joint. =Flux= The granulated flux shields and thus protects molten weld from atmospheric contamination. The flux cleans weld metal and can also modify its chemical composition. The flux is granulated to a definite size. It may be of fused, bonded or mechanically mixed type. The flux may consist of fluorides of calcium and oxides of calcium, magnesium, silicon, aluminium and manganese. Alloying elements may be added as per requirements. Substances evolving large amount of gases during welding are never mixed with the flux. Flux with fine and coarse particle sizes are recommended for welding heavier and smaller thickness respectively. =Electrode= SAW filler material usually is a standard wire as well as other special forms. This wire normally has a thickness of 1.6 mm to 6 mm (1/16 in. to 1/4 in.). In certain circumstances, twisted wire can be used to give the arc an oscillating movement. This helps fuse the toe of the weld to the base metal.Jeffus, Larry. Welding: Principles and Applications. Florence, KY: Thomson Delmar Learning, 2002. The electrode composition depends upon the material being welded. Alloying elements may be added in the electrodes. Electrodes are available to weld mild steels, high carbon steels, low and special alloy steels, stainless steel and some of the nonferrous of copper and nickel. Electrodes are generally copper coated to prevent rusting and to increase their electrical conductivity. Electrodes are available in straight lengths and coils. Their diameters may be 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 3, 4.0, 4.8, and 6.4 mm. The approximate value of currents to weld with 1.6, 3.2 and 6.4 mm diameter electrodes are 150‚Äì350, 250‚Äì800 and 650‚Äì1350 Amps respectively. Welding Operation The flux starts depositing on the joint to be welded. Since the flux when cold is non-conductor of electricity, the arc may be struck either by touching the electrode with the work piece or by placing steel wool between electrode and job before switching on the welding current or by using a high frequency unit. In all cases the arc is struck under a cover of flux. Flux otherwise is an insulator but once it melts due to heat of the arc, it becomes highly conductive and hence the current flow is maintained between the electrode and the workpiece through the molten flux. The upper portion of the flux, in contact with atmosphere, which is visible remains granular (unchanged) and can be reused. The lower, melted flux becomes slag, which is waste material and must be removed after welding. The electrode is continuously fed to the joint to be welded at a predetermined speed. In semi-automatic welding sets the welding head is moved manually along the joint. In automatic welding a separate drive moves either the welding head over the stationary job or the job moves/rotates under the stationary welding head. The arc length is kept constant by using the principle of a self- adjusting arc. If the arc length decreases, arc voltage will increase, arc current and therefore burn-off rate will increase thereby causing the arc to lengthen. The reverse occurs if the arc length increases more than the normal. A backing plate of steel or copper may be used to control penetration and to support large amounts of molten metal associated with the process. =Key SAW process variables= * Wire feed speed (main factor in welding current control) * Arc voltage * Travel speed * Electrode stick-out (ESO) or contact tip to work (CTTW) * Polarity and current type (AC or DC) and variable balance AC current Material applications * Carbon steels (structural and vessel construction) * Low alloy steels * Stainless steels * Nickel-based alloys * Surfacing applications (wear-facing, build-up, and corrosion resistant overlay of steels) Advantages * High deposition rates (over 45 kg/h (100 lb/h) have been reported). * High operating factors in mechanized applications. * Deep weld penetration. * Sound welds are readily made (with good process design and control). * High speed welding of thin sheet steels up to 5 m/min (16 ft/min) is possible. * Minimal welding fume or arc light is emitted. * Practically no edge preparation is necessary depending on joint configuration and required penetration. * The process is suitable for both indoor and outdoor works. * Welds produced are sound, uniform, ductile, corrosion resistant and have good impact value. * Single pass welds can be made in thick plates with normal equipment. * The arc is always covered under a blanket of flux, thus there is no chance of spatter of weld. * 50% to 90% of the flux is recoverable, recycled and reused. Limitations * Limited to ferrous (steel or stainless steels) and some nickel-based alloys. * Normally limited to the 1F, 1G, and 2F positions. * Normally limited to long straight seams or rotated pipes or vessels. * Requires relatively troublesome flux handling systems. * Flux and slag residue can present a health and safety concern. * Requires inter-pass and post weld slag removal. * Requires backing strips for proper root penetration. * Limited to high thickness materials.

Among these, about 45 subspecies are recognized. They are non-venomous snakes and are ophiophagous in diet. Etymology Lampropeltis includes the Greek words for \\"shiny shield\\": (\\"shiny\\") + (\\"peltƒì shield\\") + (a Latin suffix). The name is given to them in reference to their smooth, enamel-like dorsal scales. Their common name of \\"kingsnake\\" derives from their habit of eating other snakes (such as rattlesnakes) Range and morphology Kingsnake species inhabit the Americas from southeastern Canada to southern Ecuador. Several species vary widely in size and coloration. Adult scarlet kingsnakes are typically 40 to 50 cm (16 to 20 in) in length, while the common kingsnake can grow to 1.8 m (6 ft). Some kingsnakes are colored in muted browns to black, while others are brightly marked in white, reds, yellows, grays, and lavenders that form rings, longitudinal stripes, speckles, and saddle-shaped bands. Behavior and diet Kingsnakes use constriction to kill their prey and tend to be opportunistic in their diet; they eat other snakes (ophiophagy), including venomous snakes. Kingsnakes also eat lizards, rodents, birds, and eggs.Conant, R. (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 429 pp. (paperback). (Genus Lampropeltis, p. 201.) The common kingsnake is known to be immune to the venom of other snakes and does eat rattlesnakes, but it is not necessarily immune to the venom of snakes from different localities. The \\"king\\" in the name (as with the king cobra) refers to its preying on other snakes. Kingsnakes such as the California kingsnake can exert twice as much constriction force relative to body size as rat snakes and pythons. Scientists believe such strong coils may be an adaptation to snake and other reptile prey, which can sustain lower blood-oxygen levels before asphyxiating. Description Most kingsnakes have quite vibrant patterns on their skins. Some species, such as the scarlet kingsnake, Mexican milk snake, and red milk snake, have coloration and patterning that can cause them to be confused with the highly venomous coral snakes. One of the mnemonic rhymes to help people distinguish between the coral snake and its nonvenomous lookalikes in the United States is \\"Red on black, a friend of Jack; red on yellow, kill a fellow.\\" Other variations include \\"Red on yellow kill a fellow. Red on black venom lack.\\" Life's Better Outdoors, South Carolina Department of natural resources (see FAQ's. -- \\"are there any visual clues\\").

Linda Workman (pages 141-142) and \\"Yellow, red, stop!\\", referencing the order of traffic lights. Both mnemonics apply only to coral snakes native to North America: Micrurus fulvius (the eastern or common coral snake), Micrurus tener (the Texas coral snake), and Micruroides euryxanthus (the Arizona coral snake), found in the southeastern and southwestern United States. Coral snakes found in other parts of the world can have distinctly different patterns, have red bands touching black bands, have only pink and blue bands, or have no bands at all. Taxonomy Taxonomic reclassification of the kingsnakes is an ongoing process and different sources often disagree, one source granting full species status to a group of these snakes that another source considers a subspecies group. In the case of Lampropeltis catalinensis, for example, only a single specimen exists, so classification is not necessarily finite. In addition, hybridization between species with overlapping geographic ranges is not uncommon, confusing taxonomists further. Predators Kingsnakes are often preyed upon by large vertebrates, such as birds of prey. Tarantulas also sometimes prey on them.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NDf2J5Mmjo List of kingsnake species and subspecies Mole kingsnake (Lampropeltis calligaster rhombomaculata) California kingsnake (Lampropeltis californiae) Eastern kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula getula) Speckled kingsnake (Lampropeltis holbrooki) Kingsnake species and subspecies include (listed here alphabetically by specific and subspecific name): *Guatemalan milk snake, Lampropeltis abnorma (Bocourt, 1886) *Gray-banded kingsnake, Lampropeltis alterna (A.

Its principles are geared towards how the nature of a person's job affects their attitudes and behavior at work, particularly relating to characteristics such as skill variety and autonomy. The aim of a job design is to improve job satisfaction, to improve through-put, to improve quality and to reduce employee problems (e.g., grievances, absenteeism). Job characteristic theory The job characteristic theory proposed by Hackman & Oldham (1976) stated that work should be designed to have five core job characteristics, which engender three critical psychological states in individuals‚Äîexperiencing meaning, feeling responsible for outcomes, and understanding the results of their efforts. In turn, these psychological states were proposed to enhance employees‚Äô intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, quality of work and performance, while reducing turnover. =Core job dimensions= # Skill variety ‚Äî This refers to the range of skills and activities necessary to complete the job. The more a person is required to use a wide variety of skills, the more satisfying the job is likely to be. # Task identity ‚Äî This dimension measures the degree to which the job requires completion of a whole and identifiable piece of work. Employees who are involved in an activity from start to finish are usually more satisfied. # Task significance ‚Äî This looks at the impact and influence of a job. Jobs are more satisfying if people believe that they make a difference, and are adding real value to colleagues, the organization, or the larger community. # Autonomy ‚Äî This describes the amount of individual choice and discretion involved in a job. More autonomy leads to more satisfaction. For instance, a job is likely to be more satisfying if people are involved in making decisions, instead of simply being told what to do. # Feedback ‚Äî This dimension measures the amount of information an employee receives about his or her performance, and the extent to which he or she can see the impact of the work. The more people are told about their performance, the more interested they will be in doing a good job. So, sharing production figures, customer satisfaction scores etc. can increase the feedback levels. =Critical psychological states= The five core job dimensions listed above result in three different psychological states. * Experienced meaningfulness of the work: The extent to which people believe that their job is meaningful, and that their work is valued and appreciated (comes from core dimensions 1-3). * Experienced responsibility for the outcomes of work: The extent to which people feel accountable for the results of their work, and for the outcomes they have produced (comes from core dimension 4). * Knowledge of the actual results of the work activity: The extent to which people know how well they are doing (comes from core dimension 5). Techniques of job design =Job rotation= Job rotation is a job design process by which employee roles are rotated in order to promote flexibility and tenure in the working environment. Through job rotation, employees laterally mobilize and serve their tasks in different organizational levels; when an individual experiences different posts and responsibilities in an organization, the ability to evaluate his or her capabilities in the organization increases. By design, it is intended to enhance motivation, develop workers' outlook, increase productivity, improve the organization's performance on various levels by its multi-skilled workers, and provides new opportunities to improve the attitude, thought, capabilities and skills of workers. =Job enlargement= Hulin and Blood (1968) define Job enlargement as the process of allowing individual workers to determine their own pace (within limits), to serve as their own inspectors by giving them responsibility for quality control, to repair their own mistakes, to be responsible for their own machine set-up and repair, and to attain choice of method. By working in a larger scope, as Hulin and Blood state, workers are pushed to adapting new tactics, techniques, and methodologies on their own. Frederick Herzberg referred to the addition of interrelated tasks as 'horizontal job loading,' or, in other words, widening the breadth of an employee's responsibilities. =Job enrichment= Job enrichment increases the employees‚Äô autonomy over the planning and execution of their own work, leading to self-assigned responsibility. Because of this, job enrichment has the same motivational advantages of job enlargement, however it has the added benefit of granting workers autonomy. Frederick Herzberg viewed job enrichment as 'vertical job loading' because it also includes tasks formerly performed by someone at a higher level where planning and control are involved. = Scientific management = Under scientific management people would be directed by reason and the problems of industrial unrest would be appropriately (i.e., scientifically) addressed. This philosophy is oriented toward the maximum gains possible to employees. Managers would guarantee that their subordinates would have access to the maximum of economic gains by means of rationalized processes. Organizations were portrayed as rationalized sites, designed and managed according to a rule of rationality imported from the world of technique. =Human Relations School= The Human Relations School takes the view that businesses are social systems in which psychological and emotional factors have a significant influence on productivity. The common elements in human relations theory are the beliefs that * Performance can be improved by good human relations * Managers should consult employees in matters that affect staff * Leaders should be democratic rather than authoritarian * Employees are motivated by social and psychological rewards and are not just \\"economic animals\\" * The work group plays an important part in influencing performance = Socio-technical systems = Socio-technical systems aims on jointly optimizing the operation of the social and technical system; the good or service would then be efficiently produced and psychological needs of the workers fulfilled. Embedded in Socio-technical Systems are motivational assumptions, such as intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. As Bradbury and Reason (2005) state, this approach causes workers to focus less on being highly specialized, and more on becoming multi-skilled and self-directed. = Work reform = Work reform states about the workplace relation and the changes made which are more suitable to management and employee to encourage increased workforce participation. = Motivational work design = The psychological literature on employee motivation contains considerable evidence that job design can influence satisfaction, motivation and job performance. It influences them primarily because it affects the relationship between the employee's expectancy that increased performance will lead to rewards and the preference of different rewards for the individual. Hackman and Oldman developed the theory that a workplace can be redesigned to greater improve their core job characteristics. Their overall concept consists of: *Making larger work units by combining smaller, more specialized tasks. *Mandating worker(s) to be responsible via having direct contact with clients. *Having employee evaluations done frequently in order to provide feedback for learning. *Allowing workers to be responsible for their job by giving them authority and control. = Two Factor Theory = Frederick Herzberg's Two Factor Theory (Motivator-Hygiene Theory) proposes that the factors that correlate to motivation in the work environment are separate to those factors that correlate to dissatisfaction. He relates these factors to the perceived satisfaction of a set of needs as a reward for completing a task; universal necessities and expectations such as healthcare and salary do not contribute to motivation as much as factors such as achievement or recognition. Employees of a work environment therefore are motivated and dissatisfied by two sets of factors: # Hygiene Factors (e.g. salary, clean working environment); these do not contribute to motivation, but their absence can lead to dissatisfaction. # Motivational Factors (e.g. opportunity for meaningful work, sense of importance); these contribute to one's intrinsic motivation to work in an environment.  Economic theory  In economics, job design has been studied in the field of contract theory. In particular, Holmstr√∂m and Milgrom (1991) have developed the multi-task moral hazard model. Some of the tasks are easier to measure than other tasks, so one can study which tasks should be bundled together. While the original model was focused on the incentives versus insurance trade-off when agents are risk-averse, subsequent work has also studied the case of risk-neutral agents who are protected by limited liability. In this framework, researchers have studied whether tasks that are in direct conflict with each other (for instance, selling products that are imperfect substitutes) should be delegated to the same agent or to different agents. The optimal task assignment depends on whether the tasks are to be performed simultaneously or sequentially.

It is on the A671 which is the main road between Burnley and Clitheroe. The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 census was 1,419. History The name \\"Read\\" is a contraction of Old English words meaning female roe deer and ridge or headland. The old village developed in the 16th century along the main mediaeval road between Whalley and Padiham. The Battle of Read Old Bridge was fought in 1643 between the Royalist and Parliamentarian forces. The Royalist force of about 4,000 men, commanded by the Earl of Derby, had taken the village of Whalley. The Parliamentary force, numbering only about 400 men, were positioned near Read Old Bridge. As the Royalist forces approached the bridge they faced withering musket fire causing them to retreat in confusion. The Royalists gave up Whalley; about 400 largely untrained soldiers had beaten 4,000, winning Lancashire for Parliament. Governance Read was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley, with the River Calder forming the boundary with Altham and Sabden Brook with Whalley. This became a civil parish in 1866, forming part of the Burnley Rural District from 1894 to 1974. Parts of the parish transferred to Sabden on its creation in 1904. It has since become part of the borough of Ribble Valley. Together with Simonstone, the parish forms the Read and Simonstone ward of Ribble Valley Borough Council. The ward had a population of 2,535 in 2001, rising to 2,573 in 2011. The ward elects two councillors, who currently are Richard Bennett and Lesley Graves, both of the Conservative Party. Landmarks Read Hall and Park was the seat of the Nowell family from the 14th century and Roger Nowell was a magistrate at the time of the Lancashire Witches in 1612 sending them to Lancaster for trial and eventual execution.Burnley Express 12 January 2010 Victorian history of Read Hall ‚Äì includes picture and gives the date of the hall as 1818‚Äì1825 In the 1870s Victoria Mill, together with a few houses for employees, was built alongside the turnpike road by the Kemp family and this area of Read became known as Newtown. More houses and shops were built using stone quarried in the village and Read now has a variety of small businesses catering for many needs. The parish church is dedicated to St John the Evangelist by Henry Ross of Accrington, 1884, with the west steeple dating from 1911. The nearby Martholme Viaduct, about south-west carried the defunct Great Harwood loop line of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway over the River Calder between Simonstone and Great Harwood and was built by Sturges Meek, 1870‚Äì77, and consists of ten 65 ft high arches on a gentle curve.

Due to ease of care and a wide range of color variations, the California kingsnake is one of the most popular snakes in captivity.  Range and habitat  The California kingsnake is widespread along the West Coast of North America to elevations of approximately in the Tehachapi Mountains and to over in the southeastern Sierra Nevada Mountains. This species lives in a wide variety of habitats, including woodland chaparral, grassland, deserts, marshes, and even suburban areas. These snakes live in Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, southwestern Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, and northwestern Mexico. In Arizona, they intergrade with the desert kingsnake (Lampropeltis splendida) and the Mexican black kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula nigrita). The species has also become invasive on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria.  Behavior and diet  The California kingsnake is primarily diurnal, but may become increasingly nocturnal during periods of particularly hot weather.California King Snake. Rosamond Gifford Zoo. Retrieved on 2013-01-02. In the winter, they retreat underground and enter a hibernation-like state called brumation. When disturbed, California kingsnakes will often coil their bodies to hide their heads, hiss, and rattle their tails, which can produce a sound somewhat resembling that of a rattlesnake. They are considered harmless to humans, but if handled it is common for this species to bite, as well as excrete musk and fecal contents from their cloaca.Hubbs, Brian (2009) Common Kingsnakes. Tricolor Books, Tempe, Arizona . California kingsnakes are opportunistic feeders and common food items include rodents, birds, other reptiles and amphibians. All kingsnakes are non-venomous, but are powerful constrictors and generally kill their prey through suffocation. The \\"king\\" in their name refers to their propensity to hunt and eat other snakes, including venomous rattlesnakes, that are commonly indigenous to their natural habitat. California kingsnakes are naturally resistant to the venom of rattlesnakes, but are not totally immune. As was discovered in studies of kingsnake muscle power, California kingsnakes seem to have the strongest squeeze proportionate to body size of any snakes, like larger snakes such as the Burmese python, green anaconda, reticulated python and twice that of a similarly sized rat snake or python. This adaptation may have evolved in response to the snake's diet of reptilian prey, which needs less oxygen to survive an attack by constriction than mammals do.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/snakes-constrictors-kill- predators-muscles/  Reproduction  The California kingsnake is an oviparous internal fertilization animal, meaning it lays eggs, as opposed to giving live birth like some other snakes. Courtship for this kingsnake begins in the spring and involves the males competing for available females. Their mating ritual begins by the male snake vibrating uncontrollably. Eggs are laid between May and August, which is generally 42‚Äì63 days after mating;in preparation the female will have chosen a suitable location. The typical clutch size is five to 12 eggs with an average of nine, though clutches of 20 or more eggs are known. The hatchlings usually emerge another 40‚Äì65 days later and are approximately eight to 13 inches in length. Adult California kingsnakes are most commonly 2.5‚Äì3.5 feet in length, and rarely exceed four feet.Lampropeltis getula californiae ‚Äì California Kingsnake . Californiaherps.com.

Due to natural color and pattern variability between individual snakes, snake enthusiasts have selectively bred for a variety of color patterns and morphs. Dozens of color variations are sold in the pet trade. Wildtype California kingsnakes are technically illegal to sell without special permits in their home state of California. These increased restrictions are due to a law that prohibits trafficking native California species within state lines. As captive-bred morphs are generally exempt from these rules, the law is loosely enforced.

Initially, it was a nickname, but lost that purpose when it became hereditary. Hereditary cognomina were used to augment the second name, the gens (the family name, or clan name), in order to identify a particular branch within a family or family within a clan. The term has also taken on other contemporary meanings. Roman names Because of the limited nature of the Latin praenomen, the cognomen developed to distinguish branches of the family from one another, and occasionally, to highlight an individual's achievement, typically in warfare. One example of this is Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, whose cognomen Magnus was earned after his military victories under Sulla's dictatorship. The cognomen was a form of distinguishing people who made important feats, and those who already bore a cognomen were awarded another exclusive name, the agnomen. For example, Publius Cornelius Scipio received the agnomen Africanus after his victory over the Carthaginian general Hannibal at Zama, Africa (Africanus here means \\"of Africa\\" in the sense that his fame derives from Africa, rather than being born in Africa, which would have been Afer); and the same procedure occurred in the names of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus (conqueror of Numidia) and Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus. In contrast to the honorary cognomina adopted by successful generals, most cognomina were based on a physical or personality quirk; for example, Rufus meaning \\"red-haired\\" or Scaevola meaning \\"left- handed\\". Some cognomina were hereditary (such as Caesar among a branch of the Julii, Brutus and Silanus among the Junii, or Pilius and Metellus among the Caecilii): others tended to be individual. And some names appear to have been used both as praenomen, agnomen, or non-hereditary cognomen. For instance, Vopiscus was used as both praenomen and cognomen in the Julii Caesares; likewise Nero among the early imperial Claudii, several of whom used the traditional hereditary Claudian cognomen as a praenomen. The upper-class usually used the cognomen to refer to one another. Today, we refer to many prominent ancient Romans by only their cognomen; for example, Cicero (from cicer \\"chickpea\\") serves as a shorthand for Marcus Tullius Cicero, and Caesar for Gaius Julius Caesar. As a contemporary term The term \\"cognomen\\" (sometimes pluralized \\"cognomens\\") has come into use as an English noun used outside the context of Ancient Rome. According to the 2012 edition of the Random House Dictionary, cognomen can mean a \\"surname\\" or \\"any name, especially a nickname\\".Cognomen dictionary.com The basic sense in English is \\"how one is well known\\". For example Alfred the Great. (This is more similar to the Roman use of agnomen than their use of cognomen.) Catalan cognom and Italian cognome, derived from the Latin cognomen, mean \\"family name\\". Maltese kunjom is derived from the Italian version, retaining the same meaning. The term \\"cognomen\\" can also be applied to cultures with a clan structure and naming conventions comparable to those of Ancient Rome; thus, hereditary \\"cognomina\\" have been described as in use among the Xhosa (Iziduko), the Igbo (Aha Otutu), the Yoruba (Oriki), or the Zulu (Isibongo).

It was founded on December 31, 1967.Neil A. Hamilton, The ABC-CLIO companion to the 1960s counterculture in America, Page 339, ABC-CLIO, 1997 They employed theatrical gestures to mock the social status quo, such as advancing a pig (\\"Pigasus the Immortal\\") as a candidate for president of the United States in 1968. They have been described as a highly theatrical, anti- authoritarian and anarchist youth movement of \\"symbolic politics\\".Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 128. Perigee Books, 1980. Since they were well known for street theater and politically themed pranks, they were either ignored or denounced by many of the \\"old school\\" political left. According to ABC News, \\"The group was known for street theater pranks and was once referred to as the 'Groucho Marxists'.\\" Background The Yippies had no formal membership or hierarchy. It was founded by Abbie and Anita Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Nancy Kurshan, and Paul Krassner, at a meeting in the Hoffmans' New York apartment on December 31, 1967.Rubin, Jerry, DO IT! Scenarios of the Revolution, page 81, Simon and Schuster, 1970. According to his own account, Krassner coined the name. \\"If the press had created 'hippie,' could not we five hatch the 'yippie'?\\" Abbie Hoffman wrote. Other activists associated with the Yippies include Stew Albert, Ed Rosenthal, Allen Ginsberg, Judy Gumbo,Ed Sanders, Robin Morgan, Phil Ochs, Robert M.

The flag had a black background with a five-pointed red star in the center, and a green cannabis leaf superimposed over it. When asked about the Yippie flag, an anonymous Yippie identified only as \\"Jung\\" told The New York Times that \\"The black is for anarchy. The red star is for our five point program. And the leaf is for marijuana, which is for getting ecologically stoned without polluting the environment.\\" This flag is also mentioned in Hoffman's Steal This Book.Abbie Hoffman, Steal This Book, page 73. Grove Press, 1971. Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin became the most famous Yippies‚Äîand bestselling authors‚Äîin part due to publicity surrounding the five-month Chicago Seven Conspiracy trial of 1969. They both used the phrase \\"ideology is a brain disease\\" to separate the Yippies from mainstream political parties that played the game by the rules. Hoffman and Rubin were arguably the most colorful of the seven defendants accused of criminal conspiracy and inciting to riot at the August 1968 Democratic National Convention. Hoffman and Rubin used the trial as a platform for Yippie antics‚Äîat one point, they showed up in court attired in judicial robes. =Origins= Festival of Life. The term Yippie was invented by Krassner and Hoffman on New Year's Eve 1967. Paul Krassner wrote in a January 2007 article in the Los Angeles Times: Anita Hoffman liked the word, but felt that The New York Times and other \\"strait-laced types\\" needed a more formal name to take the movement seriously. That same night she came up with Youth International Party, because it symbolized the movement and made for a good play on words.David T. Dellinger, Judy Clavir and John Spitzer, The Conspiracy Trial, page 349. Bobbs-Merrill, 1970. Along with the name Youth International Party, the organization was also simply called Yippie!, as in a shout for joy (with an exclamation mark to express exhilaration).Jonah Raskin, For the Hell of It, page 129. University of California Press, 1996. \\"What does Yippie! mean?\\" Abbie Hoffman wrote. \\"Energy ‚Äì fun ‚Äì fierceness ‚Äì exclamation point!\\"Abbie Hoffman, Revolution For the Hell of It, page 81. Dial Press, 1968. =First press conference= The Yippies held their first press conference in New York at the Americana Hotel March 17, 1968, five months before the August 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Judy Collins sang at the press conference. The Chicago Sun-Times reported it with an article titled: \\"Yipes! The Yippies Are Coming!\\" The New Nation concept The Yippie \\"New Nation\\" concept called for the creation of alternative, counterculture institutions: food co-ops; underground newspapers and zines; free clinics and support groups; artist collectives; potlatches, \\"swap-meets\\" and free stores; organic farming/permaculture; pirate radio, bootleg recording and public-access television; Squatting; free schools; etc. Yippies believed these cooperative institutions and a radicalized hippie culture would spread until they supplanted the existing system. Many of these ideas/practices came from other (overlapping and intermingling) counter-cultural groups such as the Diggers, the San Francisco Mime Troupe, the Merry Pranksters/Deadheads,Rosie McGee, \\"Total Environmental Theatre\\" in Grateful Dead Family Album, p. 38-40, Time-Warner Books 1990, ed. Jerilyn Lee Brandelius Jerilyn Lee Brandelius, \\"Every Structure Became a Dwelling\\" in Grateful Dead Family Album, p. 68-69, Time-Warner Books 1990, ed.

There was much overlap, social interaction and cross- pollination within these groups and the Yippies, so there was much crossover membership, as well as similar influences and intentions.Tom Wolfe, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Farrar Straus Giroux, 1968 Robert Stone, Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties, HarperCollins Publishers, 2007 \\"We are a people. We are a new nation,\\" YIP's New Nation Statement said of the burgeoning hippie movement. \\"We want everyone to control their own life and to care for one another ... We cannot tolerate attitudes, institutions, and machines whose purpose is the destruction of life, the accumulation of profit.\\"The New Yippie Book Collective (eds.), Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, page 514. Bleecker Publishing, 1983. The goal was a decentralized, collective, anarchistic nation rooted in the borderless hippie counterculture and its communal ethos. Abbie Hoffman wrote: > We shall not defeat Amerika by organizing a political party. We shall do it > by building a new nation‚Äîa nation as rugged as the marijuana leaf.Abbie > Hoffman, Woodstock Nation, back cover. Vintage Books, 1969.John Anthony > Moretta, The Hippies: A 1960s History, p. 260. McFarland & Company, > Jefferson, NC. 2017. The flag for the \\"new nation\\" consisted of a black background with a red five pointed star in the center and a green marijuana leaf superimposed over it (same as the YIP flag).Flags of the World ‚Äì Youth International Party listing The Chicago History Museum shows a different flag for the new nation. It is not the marijuana leaf. It has the word NOW under what looks like the all- seeing eye on a pyramid seen on the back of a dollar bill. Culture and activism The Yippies often paid tribute to rock 'n' roll and irreverent pop- culture figures such as the Marx Brothers, James Dean and Lenny Bruce. Many Yippies used nicknames which contained Baby Boomer television or pop references, such as Pogo or Gumby. (Pogo was notable for creating the famous slogan: \\"We have met the enemy and he is us\\"‚Äîfirst used on a 1970 Earth Day poster.) The Yippies' love of pop-culture was one way to differentiate the Old and New Left, as Jesse Walker writes in Reason magazine: At demonstrations and parades, Yippies often wore face paint or colorful bandannas to keep from being identified in photographs. Other Yippies reveled in the spotlight, allowing their stealthier comrades the anonymity they needed for their pranks. One cultural intervention that misfired was at Woodstock, with Abbie Hoffman interrupting a performance by The Who, trying to speak against the incarceration of John Sinclair, sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1969 after giving two joints to an undercover narcotics officer. Guitarist Pete Townshend used his guitar to bat Hoffman off the stage. (Audio only) The Yippies were the first on the New Left to make a point of exploiting mass media.Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, p. 86. Perigee Books, 1980. Colorful, theatrical Yippie actions were tailored to attract media coverage and also to provide a stage where people could express the \\"repressed\\" Yippie inside them.Jerry Rubin, Do It!, page 86. Simon and Schuster, 1970. \\"We believe every nonyippie is a repressed yippie,\\" Jerry Rubin wrote in Do it! \\"We try to bring out the yippie in everybody.\\" =Early Yippie actions= A \\"Yippie!\\" button on display at the Chicago History Museum Yippies were famous for their sense of humor.Joseph Boskin, Rebellious Laughter: People's humor in America, page 98. Syracuse University Press, 1997. Many direct actions were often satirical and elaborate pranks or put-ons. An application to levitate The Pentagon during the October, 1967 March on the Pentagon, and a mass protest/mock levitation at the building organized by Rubin, Hoffman and company at the event, helped to set the tone for Yippie when it was established a couple of months later.Jonah Raskin, For the hell of it: The life and times of Abbie Hoffman, Page 117, University of California Press, 1996 Another famous prank just before Yippie was coined was a guerrilla theater event in New York City on August 24, 1967. Abbie Hoffman and a group of future Yippies managed to get into a tour of the New York Stock Exchange, where they threw fistfuls of real and fake US$ from the balcony of the visitors' gallery down to the traders below, some of whom booed, while others began to scramble frantically to grab the money as fast as they could.Soon To Be A Major Motion Picture: The Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman, First Edition, Perigree Books, 1980, p. 101. The visitors' gallery was closed until a glass barrier could be installed, to prevent similar incidents. On the 40th anniversary of the NYSE event, CNN Money editor James Ledbetter described the now-famous incident: There was a clash with police on March 22, 1968, where a large group of countercultural youths led by the Yippies descended into Grand Central Station for a \\"Yip-In\\". The night erupted into a violent clash with police that Don McNeill of The Village Voice called a \\"pointless confrontation in a box canyon\\". A month later, Yippies organized a \\"Yip-Out,\\" a be-in style event in Central Park that went off peacefully and drew 20,000 people.Neil Hamilton, The ABC-CLIO companion to the 1960s counterculture in America, Page 340, ABC-CLIO, 1997. In his book A Trumpet to Arms: Alternative Media in America, author David Armstrong points out that the Yippie hybrid of performance art, Guerilla theatre and political irreverence was often in direct conflict with the sensibility of the 60s American Left/peace movement: > The Yippies' unorthodox approach to revolution, which emphasized spontaneity > over structure, and media blitz over community organizing, put them almost > as much at odds with the rest of the left as with mainstream culture. Wrote > (Jerry) Rubin in the Berkeley Barb, \\"The worst thing you can say about a > demonstration is that it is boring, and one of the reasons that the peace > movement has not grown into a mass movement is that the peace movement‚Äîits > literature and its events‚Äîis a bore. Good theatre is needed to communicate > revolutionary content.David Armstrong, A Trumpet to Arms: Alternative Media > in America, p. 120-121, South End Press, Boston. 1981. =House Un-American Activities Committee= The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman of the Yippies in 1967, and again in the aftermath of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The Yippies used media attention to make a mockery of the proceedings: Rubin came to one session dressed as an American Revolutionary War soldier, and passed out copies of the United States Declaration of Independence to people in attendance. Then Rubin \\"blew giant gum bubbles while his co-witnesses taunted the committee with Nazi salutes\\". Rubin also attended HUAC dressed as Santa Claus and a Viet Cong soldier. On another occasion, police stopped Hoffman at the building entrance and arrested him for wearing an American flag. Hoffman quipped for the press, \\"I regret that I have but one shirt to give for my country\\", paraphrasing the last words of revolutionary patriot Nathan Hale; meanwhile Rubin, who was wearing a matching Viet Cong flag, shouted that the police were Communists for not arresting him also.Jerry Rubin, A Yippie Manifesto. According to The Harvard Crimson: > In the fifties, the most effective sanction was terror. Almost any publicity > from HUAC meant the 'blacklist.' Without a chance to clear his name, a > witness would suddenly find himself without friends and without a job. But > it is not easy to see how in 1969 a HUAC blacklist could terrorize an SDS > activist. Witnesses like Jerry Rubin have openly boasted of their contempt > for American institutions. A subpoena from HUAC would be unlikely to > scandalize Abbie Hoffman or his friends. Chicago '68 Anti-war demonstrators in Lincoln Park, Chicago, attending a Yippie organized event, approximately five miles north of the convention center. The band MC5 can be seen playing. Yippie theatrics culminated at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. YIP planned a six-day Festival of Life ‚Äì a celebration of the counterculture and a protest against the state of the nation. This was supposed to counter the \\"Convention of Death.\\" This promised to be \\"the blending of pot and politics into a political grass leaves movement ‚Äì a cross-fertilization of the hippie and New Left philosophies.\\" Yippies' sensational statements before the convention were part of the theatrics, including a tongue-in-cheek threat to put LSD in Chicago's water supply. \\"We will fuck on the beaches! ... We demand the Politics of Ecstasy! ... Abandon the Creeping Meatball! ... And all the time 'Yippie! Chicago ‚Äì August 25‚Äì30.'\\" First on a list of Yippie demands: \\"An immediate end to the war in Vietnam.\\"Norman Mailer, Miami and the Siege of Chicago, page 137. Signet Books : New American Library, 1968. Yippie organizers hoped that well- known musicians would participate in the Festival of Life and draw a crowd of tens if not hundreds of thousands from across the country. The city of Chicago refused to issue any permits for the festival and most musicians withdrew from the project. Of the rock bands who had agreed to perform, only the MC5 came to Chicago to play and their set was cut short by a clash between the audience of a couple thousand and police. Phil Ochs and several other singer-songwriters also performed during the festival. In response to the Festival of Life and other anti-war demonstrations during the Democratic convention, Chicago police repeatedly clashed with protesters, as many millions of viewers watched the extensive TV coverage of the events. On the evening of August 28 the police attacked the protesters in front of the Conrad Hilton hotel as the demonstrators chanted \\"The whole world is watching\\". This was a \\"police riot,\\" concluded the US National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, stating: > \\"On the part of the police there was enough wild club swinging, enough cries > of hatred, enough gratuitous beating to make the conclusion inescapable that > individual policemen, and lots of them, committed violent acts far in excess > of the requisite force for crowd dispersal or arrest.\\" =The conspiracy trial= Following the convention, eight protesters were charged with conspiracy to incite the riots. Their trial, which lasted five months, was heavily publicized. The Chicago Seven represented a cross-section of the New Left, including Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. In his book, American Fun: Four Centuries of Joyous Revolt, John Beckman writes: > Never mind Hair, the so-called Chicago Eight (then Seven) trial was the > countercultural performance of the sixties. Guerrilla theater stared down > courtroom farce to decide the civil dispute of the era: the Movement vs. the > Establishment. The eight defendants seemed finically chosen to represent the > world of dissent: SDS leaders Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden (who had authored > \\"The Port Huron Statement\\"); graduate students Lee Weiner and John Froines; > portly fifty-four-year-old Christian socialist David Dellinger; Yippies > Rubin and Hoffman; and‚Äîbriefly--Black Panther Bobby Seale. \\"Conspire, hell,\\" > Hoffman quipped. \\"We couldn't agree on lunch.\\" Several other Yippies ‚Äì including Stew Albert, Wolfe Lowenthal, Brad Fox and Robin Palmer ‚Äì were among another 18 activists named as \\"unindicted co- conspirators\\" in the case.David T. Dellinger, Judy Clavir and John Spitzer, The Conspiracy Trial, page 601. Bobbs-Merrill, 1970. While five of the defendants were initially convicted of crossing state lines to incite a riot, all convictions were soon reversed in appeal court. Defendants Hoffman and Rubin became popular authors and public speakers, spreading Yippie militancy and comedy wherever they appeared. When Hoffman appeared on The Merv Griffin Show, for example, he wore a shirt with an American flag design, prompting CBS to black out his image when the show aired.Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 170. Perigee Books, 1980. The Yippie movement The Youth International Party quickly spread beyond Rubin, Hoffman and the other founders. YIP had chapters all over the US and in other countries, with particularly active groups in New York City, Vancouver, Washington, D.C., Detroit, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Tucson, Houston, Austin, Columbus, Dayton, Chicago, Berkeley, San Francisco and Madison. There were YIP conferences through the 1970s, beginning with a \\"New Nation Conference\\" in Madison, Wisconsin in 1971.The New Yippie Book Collective, Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, Page 16. Bleecker Publishing, 1983. On the final day of the Madison conference, April 4, 1971, hundreds of riot police broke up a block party organized by local Yippies to cap the event, resulting in a street clash between Yippies and police.\\"Yippies Pelt Police with Eggs, Rocks.\\" April 5, 1971, The Rock Hill Herald. =Street protests= During an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C., on November 15, 1969, East Coast Yippies led thousands of youths in the storming of the Justice Department building.Kifner, John. \\"Tear Gas Repels Radicals' Attack.\\" New York Times, 16 November 1969 On August 6, 1970, L.A. Yippies invaded Disneyland, hoisting the New Nation flag at City Hall and taking over Tom Sawyer's Island. While riot police confronted the Yippies, the theme park was closed early for only the second time in the park's history (the first being shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy.). As many as 23 of the 200 Yippies attending were arrested. Vancouver Yippies invaded the US border town of Blaine, Washington, on May 9, 1970, to protest Richard Nixon's invasion of Cambodia and the shooting of students at Kent State. Columbus Yippies were charged with inciting the rioting that occurred in the city on May 11, 1972, in response to Nixon's mining of North Vietnam's Haiphong harbor. They were acquitted. YIP was a member of the coalition of anti-Vietnam War activists who, over several days in early May 1971, tried to shut down the US government by occupying intersections and bridges in Washington, D.C. The May Day protests resulted in the largest mass arrest in American history.Lester Friedman, American cinema of the 1970s: themes and variations, Page 49, NJ Rutgers University Press, 2007 A frequent 'national' complaint among Yippies was that the New York 'central HQ' chapter acted as if other chapters did not exist and kept them out of the decision-making process. At one point, at a YIP conference in Ohio in 1972, Yippies voted to 'exclude' Abbie and Jerry as official spokespersons from the party, since they had become too famous and rich. In 1972, Yippies and Zippies (a younger YIP radical breakaway faction whose \\"guiding spirit\\" was Tom Forcade) staged protests at the Republican and Democratic Conventions in Miami Beach.The New Yippie Book Collective (eds.), Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, page 354. Bleecker Publishing, 1983.Marijuana Smoke-in Held Outside Convention Hall. July 10, 1972. Sarasota Herald-Tribune. Some of the Miami protests were larger and more militant than the ones in Chicago in 1968. After Miami, the Zippies evolved back into Yippies.Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 278. Perigee Books, 1980. Poster advertising Yippie-sponsored Pittsburgh Smoke-In, Schenley Park, July 2, 1977 In 1973, Yippies marched on the Manhattan home of Watergate conspirator John Mitchell: > ... five hundred die-hard Yippies staged one last march on the Mitchell > home, no longer the Watergate but a grand apartment building on Manhattan's > Fifth Avenue. \\"Free Martha Mitchell!\\" they chanted. \\"Fuck John!\\" When the > Mitchells finally appeared at the window to see what all the commotion was > about, the stoners cherished their last \\"eye-to-eyeball confrontation with > Mr. Law 'n' Order.\\" To commemorate the moment, they placed a giant marijuana > joint on the Mitchells' doorstep. Yippies regularly protested at US presidential inaugurations, with a particularly strong presence at the 1973 inauguration of Richard Nixon. Yippies also demonstrated at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, as well as the subsequent 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, where 99 Yippies were arrested: =Smoke-ins= Poster advertising Yippie-sponsored Smoke-In at Ohio State University, April 29, 1978. Yippies organized marijuana \\"smoke-ins\\" across North America through the 1970s and into the 1980s. The first YIP smoke-in was attended by 25,000 in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 1970. There was a culture clash when many of the hippie protesters strolled en masse into the nearby \\"Honor America Day\\" festivities with Billy Graham and Bob Hope. On August 7, 1971, a Yippie smoke-in in Vancouver was attacked by police, resulting in the Gastown Riot, one of the most famous protests in Canadian history.Odam, Jes, \\"Police charge yippie plot,\\" Vancouver Sun, 1 October 1971 The annual July 4 Yippie smoke-in in Washington, D.C., became a counterculture tradition.

In Tucson, Yippies operated a free store; in Vancouver, Yippies established the People's Defense Fund to provide legal help for the often-harassed hippie community; in Milwaukee, Yippies helped launch the city's first food co-op. Many Yippies were involved in the underground press. Some were the editors of major underground newspapers or alternative magazines, including Yippies Abe Peck (Chicago Seed),Jonah Raskin, For the Hell of It, page 132.

New York Yippie Coca Crystal hosted the popular cable TV program If I Can't Dance You Can Keep Your Revolution. Yippies were active in alternative music and movies. Singer-songwriters Phil Ochs and David Peel were Yippies. \\"I helped design the party, formulate the idea of what Yippie was going to be, in the early part of 1968,\\" Ochs testified at the Chicago Eight trial. The strange, legendary cult film Medicine Ball Caravan (partly financed by Tom Forcade), chronicled Yippie drop-outs and a variety of other fascinating and dynamic characters of the era. The movie title was later controversially changed to \\"We Have Come for your Daughters\\". Radical musicians usually found enthusiastic audiences at Yippie-sponsored events and frequently offered to play.

In 1970, Pete Seeger played a Vancouver Yippie rally against construction of a highway through Jericho Beach Park.Sarti, Bob, \\"The day I met Pete Seeger,\\" The Oystercatcher, May Day 2014. The first-ever concert by the influential and iconic proto-punk band the New York Dolls, was a Yippie benefit to raise funds to pay legal fees for one of Dana Beal's marijuana arrests in the 1970s. The Youth International Party founded the US branch of the Rock Against Racism movement in 1979.Alice Torbush, Daisy Deadhead, Rock Against Racism USA - Tour Dates & Concert Calender, Overthrow/Yipster Times, p. 12-14, April 1979 Illustration : Overthrow cover: ROCK AGAINST RACISM issue, April 1979 Rock Against Racism USA later morphed into the critically acclaimed, Yippie- organized, widely recognized national Rock Against Reagan tour in 1983. Well- known bands on the tour included Michelle Shocked, the Dead Kennedys, the Crucifucks, MDC, Cause for Alarm, Toxic Reasons and Static Disruptors. A young Whoopi Goldberg performed stand-up comedy (as did Will Durst) at the San Francisco R-A-R show.Leaflet advertising Yippie-sponsored Rock Against Racism concert in Lincoln Park, Chicago, June 9, 1979 Vancouver Yippies Ken Lester and David Spaner were the managers of Canada's two most notorious political punk bands, D.O.A.

Infamous Baltimore Yippie John Waters became a renowned independent filmmaker (Pink Flamingos, Polyester, Hairspray), once claiming in an interview that the Yippies influenced his irreverent sense of style: \\"I was a Yippie agitator, and I wanted to look like Little Richard. I dressed like a hippie pimp back then, because punk wasn't around yet. =Pranking the system= Yippies mocked the system and its authority. The Youth International Party, having nominated a pig (Pigasus) for US president in 1968, famously ran Nobody for President as its 'official' candidate in 1976.*PHOTO: Nobody For President, Curtis Spangler and Wavy Gravy, October 12, 1976 (photo credit: James Stark) HeadCount.org Vancouver Yippie Betty \\"Zaria\\" Andrew ran as the Youth International Party's candidate for mayor in 1970. One of her campaign promises was to repeal every law, including the law of gravity so that everyone could get high. That same year, Berkeley Yippie Stew Albert ran for sheriff of Alameda County, challenging the incumbent sheriff to a high-noon duel and receiving 65,000 votes.Stew Albert, Who the Hell is Stew Albert?, Page 131. Red Hen Press, 2003. In 1970, Detroit Yippies went to city hall and applied for a permit to blow up the General Motors building. After the permit was denied, the Yippies said that it just goes to show you can't work within the system to change the system. \\"This destroys my last hope for legal channels,\\" said Detroit Yippie Jumpin' Jack Flash.The New Yippie Book Collective, Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, Page 414. Bleecker Publishing, 1983. Some Yippies, including Robin Morgan, Nancy Kurshan, Sharon Krebs and Judy Gumbo, were active in the Guerilla theatre feminist group W.I.T.C.H. (Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell), which combined \\"theatricality, humor, and activism.\\" On November 7, 1970, Jerry Rubin and London Yippies took over The Frost Programme when he was the guest on the popular British host's TV program. In all the chaos, a Yippie fired a water pistol into host David Frost's open mouth, the broadcaster called for a commercial break and the show was over. The Daily Mirror's banner headline: \\"THE FROST FREAKOUT.\\"Jerry Rubin, We Are Everywhere, Page 248, Harper and Row, 1971 =Pie-throwing= Pie-throwing as a political act was invented by Yippies. The first political pieing was carried out by Tom Forcade, when he pied a member of the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography in 1970. Milwaukee Yippie Pat Small was the first person to be arrested for a pieing, following a hit on a Miami alderman prior to the convention protests in 1972.The New Yippie Book Collective, Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, Page 292.

Kay's flamboyant 1979 attempt to pie Elvis Costello (for racist comments made to Bonnie Bramlett and Stephen Stills in a Columbus, Ohio Holiday Inn bar, earlier that year) was thwarted by security at the Manhattan punk nightclub Great Gildersleeves. =Nobody for President and \\"None of the Above\\"= Perhaps one of the swan songs of Yippies was a groundbreaking effort to place a new voting option, None of the Above, on the election ballot in Santa Barbara County, in California, by the Isla Vista Municipal Advisory Council in 1976. This represented an incipient libertarian impulse of Yippies and the first example in the United States of this election ballot alternative, in what one of the resolution's two co-sponsors, Matthew Steen, described as an \\"anti-institutional Yippie up-yours.\\" Years earlier Steen had been a Yippie activist with Stew Albert, as a reporter with the Berkeley Tribe. This novel motion was adopted unanimously by the council, having a ripple effect across the country, with voters in Nevada approving this option in a change to state election laws in 1986. And in 2000 a citizen initiative to place None of the Above on the official state ballot in California was qualified although the proposition was voted down 62% to 38% in the general election that year. The most recent addition, internationally, are for state elections in India where this option must be made available in electronic voting machines. In 1976, national Yippies took a cue from Isla Vistans, backing Nobody for President, a campaign that took on a life of its own in the post-Watergate malaise of the mid-70s. The Yippie campaign slogan: \\"Nobody's perfect.\\"The New Yippie Book Collective, Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, Page 321. Bleecker Publishing, 1983. (Meanwhile, in a strange twist of Yippie fate, Matthew Steen had become treasurer of a student-led campaign to elect Jerry Brown for president, competing against both \\"Nobody for President\\" and Jimmy Carter during the presidential primary campaign of that year.) From the experimental combination of Isla Vista local politics, presidential campaigns and the Yippies, the name and spirit of this unexpected ballot initiative spread quickly‚Äîin the form of None of the Above music festivals, radio and television shows, rock bands, T-shirts, buttons, (decades later) countless websites and other related social phenomena. The die-hard dedication to the 'option' of Nobody for President and None of the Above has not abated since the counter-cultural 70s, but has only grown, unexpectedly taking the Yippie legacy into a new century and succeeding generations.Nobody for President 2020Banner at Halloween Yippie Smoke-In, Columbus, Ohio, 1978 Writings \\"An exegesis on women's liberation\\" by the Women's Caucus within the Youth International Party was included in the 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan. In June 1971 Abbie Hoffman and Al Bell started the pioneer phreak magazine The Youth International Party Line (YIPL). Later, the name was changed to TAP for Technological American Party or Technological Assistance Program. Milwaukee Yippies published Street Sheet, the first of the anarchist zines later to become so popular in many cities. The Open Road, an internationally known journal of the anti-authoritarian left, was founded by a core of Vancouver Yippies. The semi-official Yippie house organ, The Yipster Times, was founded by Dana Beal in 1972 and published in New York City; Illustration : Yipster Times cover, June 1975 the name was changed to Overthrow in 1979.*OVERTHROW cover : Fall 1985 *** OVERTHROW cover : Spring 1986 credit: Bolerium Books The mercurial Yippie-turned-Zippie Tom Forcade founded the very-successful High Times magazine in 1974. So many writers for Yipster Times would go on to write for High Times, it was often referred to as the farm team. The most famous writing to come out of the Yippie movement is Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book, which is considered to be a guidebook in causing general mischief and capturing the spirit of the Yippie movement. Hoffman is also the author of Revolution for the Hell of It which has been called the original Yippie book. This book claims that there were no actual yippies, and that the name was just a term used to create a myth. Jerry Rubin published his account of the Yippie movement in his book Do IT!: Scenarios of Revolution. Books on Yippie by Yippies include Woodstock Nation and Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture (Abbie Hoffman), We Are Everywhere (Jerry Rubin), Trashing (Anita Hoffman), Who the Hell is Stew Albert? (Stew Albert), Confessions of a Raving, Unconfined Nut (Paul Krassner) and Shards of God: A Novel of the Yippies (Ed Sanders). Some other books about that era: Woodstock Census: The Nationwide Survey of the Sixties Generation (Deanne Stillman and Rex Weiner), The Panama Hat Trail (Tom Miller),Can't Find My Way Home: America in the Great Stoned Age, 1945-2000 (Martin Torgoff), Groove Tube: Sixties Television and the Youth Rebellion (Aniko Bodroghkozy), and The Ballad of Ken and Emily: or, Tales from the Counterculture (Ken Wachsberger). Buy This Book, written and illustrated by political cartoonist and post-'60s Yippie activist Pete Wagner, who distributed copies of the Yipster Times on the University of Minnesota campus in the mid-1970s, was promoted by Hoffman, who said the book \\"manages to reach to the limits of bad taste.\\" Buy This Too recounts efforts by a guerrilla street theater gang named the 1985 Brain Trust to \\"fight the New Right with Yippie-like myth-making tactics.\\" The Brain Trust was inspired by a series of meetings and interviews between Wagner and Paul Krassner in Minneapolis during May 1981, as Krassner performed stand-up comedy at Dudley Riggs ETC Theater. In 1983, a group of Yippies published Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago, '68 to 1984 (Bleecker Publishing), a large, 'phone-book sized anthology' (733 pages) of Yippie history, including journalistic accounts from both alternative and mainstream media, as well as many personal stories and essays. Includes countless photographs, old leaflets and posters, 'underground' comics, newspaper clippings, and various other historical ephemera. The editors (often doubling as authors) officially called themselves \\"The New Yippie Book Collective\\"; which included Steve Conliff (who wrote over half the volume), Dana Beal (head archivist), Grace Nichols, Daisy Deadhead, Ben Masel, Alice Torbush, Karen Wachsman, and Aron Kay. It is still in print. Vancouver Yippie Bob Sarti's play Yippies in Love, premiered in June 2011. POSTER : YIPPIES IN LOVE Theatre in the Raw, Vancouver East Cultural Centre, 2011  2000s  In 2000, a Hollywood film based on the life of Yippie co-founder Abbie Hoffman, titled Steal This Movie (spoofing the title of his book, Steal This Book), was released to mixed reviews, with Vincent D'Onofrio in the title role. Noted film critic Roger Ebert gave the movie a positive review, remarking that although it is often difficult to credibly bring historic events to life, he believed the movie succeeded: The Yippies continued as a small movement into the early 2000s. The New York chapter was known for their annual marches for decades in New York City to legalize marijuana;Marcelle Clements, The Dog Is Us, and other observations, p.46-47, Penguin Books, 1987, NYC Yippie Dana Beal started the Global Marijuana March in 1999. Beal also continued to crusade for the use of Ibogaine Beal was a forum participant. to treat heroin addicts. Another Yippie, A.J. Weberman, continued the deconstruction of the poetry of Bob Dylan and speculation about tramps on the Grassy Knoll through various websites. Weberman has for a long time been active in the Jewish Defense Organization. Throughout this decade, NYC Yippies frequently joined in local anti-gentrification protests over the continuing transformation of New York's Lower East Side. In 2008, there was a very public feud between A.J. Weberman and fellow founding-Yippie, popular New York radio host Bob Fass of WBAI. The incidents around this feud briefly brought increased local attention to Yippies, particularly since this occurred around the same time a new PBS movie about the Chicago riots was getting widespread national attention. The film featured Hank Azaria as Abbie Hoffman and Mark Ruffalo as Jerry Rubin, touching off a new generation's interest, since both are now deceased. In 1989, Abbie Hoffman, who had been suffering intermittent bouts of depression, committed suicide with alcohol and about 150 phenobarbital pills. By contrast, Jerry Rubin became a fast-talking (and by all accounts, fairly successful) stockbroker and showed no regrets. In 1994 he was fatally injured by a car while jaywalking. By the age of 50, Rubin had broken with many of his previous countercultural views; he was interviewed by The New York Times, which described him as a \\"yippie-turned-conspicuous- yuppie.\\" In the interview, he stated that \\"Until me, nobody had really taken off their clothes and screamed out loud, 'It's O.K. to make money!'\\" Yippie museum and cafe In 2004, the Yippies, along with the National AIDS Brigade, purchased the long-time Yippie \\"headquarters\\" (which had initially been acquired by squatting) at 9 Bleecker Street in New York City for $1.2 million. After official purchase, it was converted into the \\"Yippie Museum/Caf√© and Gift Shop\\", housing a multitude of counter-cultural and leftist memorabilia from all over the world, as well as providing an independently operated caf√© that featured live music on scheduled nights. Performers at the caf√© included both nationally known figures and local bands, including Roseanne Barr, Ed Rosenthal, The Fiction Circus, and Joel Landy. The museum was chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. According to the original curator's message, the museum was founded \\"to preserve the history of the Youth International Party and all of its offshoots.\\" The Board of Directors: Dana Beal, Aron Kay, David Peel, William Propp, Paul DeRienzo, and A. J. Weberman.YippieCafe.com. George Martinez was a semi-frequent speaker at the Yippies' Open-Mic, known as \\"Occupational Hazards/The People's Soapbox,\\" as was Andy Stepanian and Captain Ray Lewis. In Summer 2013, The Yippie Cafe officially closed. At the beginning of 2014, the Yippie building (Museum) at #9 Bleecker was sold, closed and permanently cleaned out; most of the memorabilia and historic materials dispersed among the remaining New York Yippies. As of 2017, the old Yippie building at #9 Bleecker had been totally transformed into a successful Bowery-area Boxing club called \\"Overthrow\\", deliberately and artfully retaining much of its original Yippie/60s-revolutionary decor. Tourists still drop by to see it.

It is the partner school of the all-boys City of London School and the City of London Freemen's School. All three schools receive funding from the City's Cash. It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) and the Girls' Schools Association. History The school was founded using a bequest by William Ward, a merchant of Brixton, in 1894. It was his conviction that girls should be given a broad and liberal education with an emphasis on scholarship; he left a third of his fortune to the City of London to fund the foundation of a girls' school, a ¬£20,000 legacy for the City of London Corporation. The school now receives financial support from the City Livery Companies as well as banks and other City firms. Links with the City of London remain strong ‚Äì the City administers the school and the Board of Governors is appointed by the Court of Common Council. The school has strong links with its brother school ‚Äì the City of London School - which is just a 15-minute walk away. The school celebrated its 110th Anniversary in 2004‚Äì05, under the title of 'Women in Leadership'. It celebrated its 111th Anniversary in 2005‚Äì06, under the same title. It celebrated its 112th Anniversary in 2006‚Äì2007 under the title of 'International Women in Leadership'.  General  City of London School for Girls The Good Schools Guide called the school an \\"Academic and hard-working day school that currently produces good results,articulate and independent girls.\\"Goodschoolsguide.co.uk The school is for girls aged 7 to 18. Most pupils enter aged 7 (\\"7+\\" for the Prep School), 11 (\\"11+\\"), or 16 (\\"16+\\", for Sixth Form), although casual vacancies arise occasionally. The secondary school's capacity is roughly 680 pupils. Fees are currently ¬£6,404 per term for the senior school exclusive of school lunches, and entrance is by examination. Approximately 25% of students receive bursary assistance of some kind, including full bursaries. The school remains relatively ethnically and socially diverse, and is said to be more diverse than other leading London schools in both the state and independent sectors. For 7+ and 11+ entry, the entrance exam consists of exams in English and Maths. At sixth form level, exams are set in each of the subjects they propose to study as well as a comprehension paper and logic test. The new headmistress, Jenny Brown, is the ninth headmistress of the school.  Academic  The school has an outstanding academic reputation and leading league table results. In 2018, it was rated by The Sunday times as 2nd best independent school in the UK, based on GCSE and A-Level results. It has previously topped The Times A-level league table of England's independent schools and its table of prep schools. The Good Schools Guide credited the school with a \\"Very strong work ethic,\\" noting that it \\"Continues to get good results.\\"  Extracurricular  The school's success gives it the reputation of a hot house, however, the school also encourages extracurricular activities. The arts are popular, appropriately enough for a school located across a lake from the Barbican Arts Centre. Furthermore, teachers are encouraged to go 'beyond the syllabus', exploring wider issues to nurture girls in areas that are not examined. Music lessons are available to individuals or groups, and the school has successful Junior and Senior Orchestras, Junior and Senior Choirs, a gospel choir, a barbershop group and a swing band. In 2005, City held its first ever drama festival, Moat Fest; a fortnight of productions and workshops. Sports are another strength at City, with clubs, teams and squads in abundance. City encourages girls to take up sports they have never done before and push them when necessary. The Gym and Dance display which is held every other year shows parents, relatives and friends the girls' talents and gives the girls a chance to \\"shine\\". The school has a swimming pool, a lecture theatre, two netball/tennis courts, a drama studio, an all weather playing field and an indoor gym with climbing wall, as well as a gym complete with exercise equipment such as treadmills and weights. Debating is another popular activity, with a weekly club and participation in public speaking events such as Model United Nations and European Youth Parliament. Trips and visits are common, and City girls are offered language exchanges to France, Spain, Germany and China, as well as other travelling opportunities through schemes such as World Challenge, which has seen girls go recently to Venezuela. Duke of Edinburgh Award expeditions have been confined to the UK since 2001 when student Amelia Ward was killed whilst abseiling on a Duke of Edinburgh trip in South Africa.They regularly have exchanges from countries such as Australia, China, Germany, France, and Spain. The school team won the Kids' Lit Quiz in 2010 at the world final in Edinburgh.KLQ 2010  Pastoral  The school is secular, yet has mildly Christian traditions, with an optional annual Carol Service in the neighbouring St Giles' Church. There is a Jewish Society as well as an Asian Society, an Oriental Society and an African-Caribbean Society.  The House System  City has a relatively new house system which consists of four houses. Each girl is allocated a house when they enter the school. The four houses are: *Fleet ‚Äì after Fleet Street *Tudor ‚Äì after Tudor Street *St. Bride ‚Äì after St. Bride church on Fleet Street, *Ward ‚Äì after William Ward, the founder of the school. The School encourages good-natured competition. There are a variety of inter-house competitions, including Drama, Debating, Maths, Art, Music, the Inter-House Quiz and at Sports Day, as well as several other sports competitions throughout the year.  Expansion  There is now a Sixth Form Block, intended to cater for the ever-growing number of girls ‚Äì the 2000 intake swelled from the usual 60‚Äì70 girls per year to 90+. An all-weather playing field was added to the school's outdoor facilities after the winter term of 2008. In January 2018 plans were advanced to expand the school further and open a preparatory school for four- to seven-year-olds. The school would be located in an underground car park of an adjoining tower block, Thomas More House. The school's all-weather playing pitch is already built on top of the proposed site. Residents parking space would be rationalised and placed in vacant spaces in neighbouring blocks. The conversion plan proposals include new classrooms, a hall, dining area and play spaces, which would allow the school to begin taking in pupils at reception and upwards, thus increasing pupil numbers by 150 by 2024. The plans are being prepared by Nicholas Hare Architects. There is already opposition from the neighbours who are concerned about the loss of convenient parking, the traffic hazards caused by parental drop off and pickups for so many young children and the prospect of a school with no natural ventilation or light.

Curonian was a Baltic language; some scholars consider it to have been an Eastern Baltic, intermediate between Lithuanian and Latvian,√ñsten Dahl (ed.) 2001, The Circum-Baltic Languages: Typology and Contact, vol. 1 while others like Vytautas Ma≈æiulis classify it as Western Baltic. Linguist Eduard V√§√§ri argues that it is possible that Curonians were Baltic Finns.Eduard V√§√§ri, EESTLASTE TUTVUMINE H√ïIMURAHVASTEGA JA NENDE KEELTEGA KUNI 1918. AASTANI The attested local Finnic language, Livonian, may be the source of Finnic elements in Curonian. In 1912 Latvian linguist JƒÅnis Endzelƒ´ns finally proved that Curonian was a Baltic language; according to him, Curonian by its qualities was in between Lithuanian and Latvian languages. Old Curonian disappeared in the course of the 16th century, leaving substrata in western dialects of the Latvian and Lithuanian, namely the Samogitian dialect. No written documents in this language are known, but some ancient Lithuanian texts from western regions show some Curonian influence. According to Lithuanian linguist Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius, long and intense Curonian‚ÄìLithuanian bilingualism existed. There are attested names of Curonian noblemen such as: , Velt≈´nas, Reiginas, Tvertikis, Saveidis. Samogitian words such as kuisis (a mosquito), pylƒó (a duck), blezdinga (a swallow), cyrulis (a skylark), zuikis (a rabbit), k≈´lis (a stone), purvs (a marsh), and p≈´rai (a winter wheat) considered to be of Curonian origin. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Baltic states saw a revival of scientific and cultural interest in extinct Baltic languages and tribes, including Yotvingian, Curonian, and Old Prussian.

He was censor in 231 BC, and again consul in 224 BC, when he subdued the Boii. He was a praetor in 215 BC and in 213 BC Master of Horse in the dictatorship of Gaius Claudius Centho. He was again consul in 212 BC, during the Second Punic War, winning a victory over Hanno, son of Bomilcar and capturing his camp at Beneventum. He was defeated by Hannibal at the first Battle of Capua, then captured Capua in 211 BC while serving as a proconsul. In his fourth term as consul (209 BC), he retook Lucania and Bruttium. He opposed the African expedition of Scipio Africanus Major in 205 BC, and died sometime not long thereafter. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was one of the three candidates for the position of Pontifex Maximus c. 212 BC, when he and another senior candidate Titus Manlius Torquatus, both former censors, were pipped at the post by a younger man, Publius Licinius Crassus who was not yet a curule aedile and thus probably aged in his middle thirties. Nevertheless, Flaccus made the new Pontifex his own Master of the Horse some years later. Flaccus was known for his severity towards the disloyal citizens of Capua, of whom he had the senior men executed and the rest of the citizenry condemned to slavery for their disloyalty to Rome. According to Livy, the Capuans complained of his behavior to the Roman Senate, which, however, ruled that Flaccus was within his rights. Flaccus was the grandfather of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, consul in 125 BC, who was an ardent supporter of the Brothers Gracchi. He attempted to warn Tiberius Gracchus of the plots against his life on the day that he was killed; in 121 BC, having supported Gaius Gracchus in his reform program and tried to lead an armed resistance against the Senate, he and his elder son were tracked down and executed (beheaded) without trial on the orders of the consul Lucius Opimius; the youngest son, too young to have participated in any plotting or armed revolt, died in prison, again without trial (another son was apparently the father of Fulvia, third wife of Mark Antony).

Biography =Personal life= Miles was an only child, born 23 April 1955 in Edgbaston, a suburb of Birmingham, and attended King Edward's School, Birmingham.Tony Miles, The Guardian, 14 November 2001Tony Miles, The Daily Telegraph, 14 November 2001 He was married and divorced twice, and had no children. Miles' first wife was Jana Hartston, who had previously been married to William Hartston. =Early achievements in chess= He learned the game of chess early in life and made good progress nationally, taking the titles of British under-14 Champion and under-21 Champion in 1968 and 1971, respectively. In 1973, Miles won the silver medal at the World Junior Chess Championship at Teesside, his first important event against international competition. Both he and compatriot Michael Stean defeated the tournament winner Alexander Beliavsky, but were unable to match the Soviet player's ruthlessness in dispatching lesser opponents. Miles went on to win this prestigious title the following year in Manila, while a mathematics undergraduate of the University of Sheffield. Taking the decision to pursue the game professionally, Miles did not complete his studies, but, in 1975, was awarded an MA by the University in respect of his chess achievements. =Further career highlights= In 1976, Miles became the first UK-born, chess grandmaster, narrowly beating Raymond Keene to the accolade. The naturalised, German-born Jacques Mieses was awarded the GM title in 1950, while Keith Richardson had been awarded the GM title for correspondence chess earlier in the 1970s. For his achievement, Miles won a ¬£5,000 prize, put up by wealthy businessman and chess backer Jim Slater. Miles (Amsterdam, 1976) Miles had a string of good results in the late 1970s and 1980s. He matured into a world class player and won games against high calibre opponents, such as former World Chess Champions Vasily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. In 1980 at the European Team Championship in Skara, he beat reigning World Champion Anatoly Karpov with Black, using the extremely unorthodox opening 1. e4 a6!?, the St. George Defence. It is often said that Miles learned the line from offbeat openings enthusiast Michael Basman, but in his book Play the St. George, Basman asserts there is no truth to this. Miles beat Karpov again three years later in Bath in a game that was part of the BBC's Master Game series, but it was shown only by the (co-producing) German television network, due to a BBC technicians' strike at the time of broadcast. Miles won the British Championship just once, in 1982 when the event was held in Torquay. His prime time as a chess player was the mid-1980s. On 20 May 1984 in Roetgen (Germany), Miles set a European record in blind simultaneous chess with 22 games (+10‚àí2=10);Edward Winter, Tony Miles (1955‚Äì2001), chesshistory.com this record was not broken until 2009. On the January 1984 Elo rating list, he ranked No. 18 in the world with a rating of 2599. One of his best results occurred at the Tilburg tournament in 1984, where, from a strong field, he emerged sole winner by a clear margin of one and one-half points. The following year, he tied for first at the same event with Robert H√ºbner and Viktor Korchnoi, playing several of his games while lying face down on a table, having injured his back.Miles The result was controversial, as many of Miles' opponents felt they were distracted by the unusual circumstances. A string of good performances culminated in a good showing on the January 1986 Elo rating list, where he climbed to a best-ever position of World No. 9 with a rating of 2610. During this period, there was considerable rivalry with Nunn over who was the United Kingdom's best player, the two protagonists regularly leapfrogging each other in the world rankings. Nigel Short and Speelman soon added to the competition, as the English national squad entered its strongest period. Never able to qualify out of the Interzonal stages into the Candidates' series, Miles eventually lost the race to become the first British Candidate when Short did so in 1985. However, he retained top board for England at the Thessaloniki and Dubai Olympiads of 1984 and 1986, helping the team to silver medals at each. Against Garry Kasparov, Miles had little success, not winning a game against him, and losing a 1986 match in Basel by the score of 5¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω. Following this encounter, Miles commented \\"I thought I was playing the world champion, not a monster with a thousand eyes who sees everything\\" (some sources alternatively quote Miles as having the opinion that Kasparov had 22 or 27 eyes). Miles on a stretcher with back pain, playing in Tilburg (1985) After he was hospitalised because of a mental breakdown in late 1987, Miles moved to the United States. He finished last in the 1988 U.S. Championship, but continued to play there and had some good results. In 1991, he played in the Championship of Australia, but eventually moved back to England and began to represent his native country again. He was equal first at the very strong Cappelle-la-Grande Open in 1994, 1995, and 1997, and caused a shock at the PCA Intel Rapid Chess Grand Prix in London in 1995, when he knocked out Vladimir Kramnik in the first round and Loek van Wely in the second. His bid to win the event was finally halted in the semifinal by English teammate Michael Adams. There were four notable victories at the Capablanca Memorial in Cuba (1994, 1995, 1996, and 1999). Miles also tied for first in the 1999 Continental Open in Los Angeles with Alexander Beliavsky, ƒΩubom√≠r Ft√°ƒçnik and Suat Atalƒ±k. His last tournament victory was the 2001 Canadian Open Chess Championship in Sackville, New Brunswick. Miles entered and played at the 2001 British Championship in Scarborough, but withdrew before the final round, apparently because of ill health. His final two games before his death were short draws in the Four Nations Chess League. Miles played in an extraordinary number of chess events during his career, including many arduous weekend tournaments. The Miles Variation (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.Bf4) in the Queen's Indian Defence is named after him. =Death= Miles died from heart failure on 12 November 2001. His body was found at his home in Harborne, Birmingham, after a friend called on him to take him to a bridge club. He had suffered from diabetes and a post mortem found that this contributed to his death. He was cremated at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Selly Oak on 23 November. There was a moment of silence before the seventh round of the European Team Championships in Le√≥n, Spain, in his memory. Personality Miles was often seen as a controversial figure. Once, in the last round of a tournament (Luton, UK, 1975), with Miles needing a draw for first place, and his opponent, Stewart Reuben, wanting a draw for a high placing, he agreed a draw without playing any moves. The arbiter decided to give both players no points for this non-game; the players claimed this \\"game\\" had been played often, when players prearranged a draw ‚Äì this was the only time it had been scored 0‚Äì0, rather than playing out some meaningless moves. This sparked lengthy correspondence in British chess journals. Miles also clashed with chess authorities and with his fellow English players, particularly Keene and Short. Miles made accusations regarding payments that Keene had received from the British Chess Federation for acting as his assistant in the 1985 Interzonal tournament in Tunis. Miles became obsessed with the affair, eventually suffering a mental breakdown over it. He was arrested in September 1987 in Downing Street, apparently under the belief that he had to speak to then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about the matter; he was subsequently hospitalised for two months. Writing in The Daily Telegraph in November 2003, Nigel Short said that \\"Tony was insanely jealous of my success, and his inability to accept that he was no longer the UK's number one was an indication of, if not a trigger for, his descent into madness.\\" Miles was also noted for his acerbic wit. He often attacked chess personalities in published articles. He attacked former World Champion Anatoly Karpov in an article entitled \\"Has Karpov Lost his Marbles?\\". Other victims of his published attacks were Woman Grandmaster Martha Fierro,Martha Fierro and Tony Miles, anusha.com and Indian chess organizer Umar Koya. His review of Eric Schiller's book Unorthodox Chess Openings (Cardoza Publishing, 1998) which appeared in Kingpin consisted of just two words: \\"Utter crap.\\" Notable games *Karpov vs. Miles, Skara 1980. St. George Defence: 0‚Äì1. The game between Karpov and Miles with the opening line 1.e4 a6. *Miles vs. Spassky, 1982. Queen's Indian Opening: 1‚Äì0. A crushing sacrificial attack against Spassky, then still one of the world's strongest players. *Karpov vs. Miles, Bath 1983, Caro‚ÄìKann: 0‚Äì1. Another win against Karpovthen world championand again with black. Miles chooses a less popular system in the Caro‚ÄìKann and succeeds in creating an unbalanced game where both sides can play for the win.

The game was invented (or rediscovered) around 1970 by Shigenobu Kusumoto of Osaka, Japan. The rules are nearly identical to those of standard shogi, with the exception that it is played on a 5x5 board with a reduced number of pieces, and each player's promotion zone consists only of the rank farthest from the player. Rules of the game =Objective= Like in standard shogi, each player aims to capture the opponent's king. =Game equipment= Two players play on a board ruled into a grid of five ranks (rows) by five files (columns). The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. Each player begins with a set of 6 wedge-shaped pieces; these are: *1 king *1 rook *1 bishop *1 gold general *1 silver general *1 pawn Their movements are identical to those of their namesakes in standard shogi. =Setup= right Each player places his/her pieces in the positions shown below, pointing towards the opponent. In the rank nearest to the player: *The king is placed in the leftmost file; *The gold general is placed in the adjacent file to the king; *The silver general is placed adjacent to the gold general; *The bishop is placed adjacent to the silver general; *The rook is placed in the rightmost file, adjacent to the bishop. That is, the setup of the first rank is as follows: _KGSBR_. In the second rank, each player places the pawn in the same file as the king (i.e. directly in front of the king). =Promotion= Like in standard shogi, a piece may (but is not obliged to) be promoted when it is moves into, within, or out of the promotion zone. The zone only lies within the rank farthest from the player (unlike in the standard game, where it lies within the last three ranks). All pieces promote the same way as their namesakes in standard shogi (and likewise, the kings and gold generals do not promote at all). The pawns must be promoted once they reach the farthest rank (since otherwise they would not have any legal moves). =Drops= The rules for dropping pieces are identical to those in standard shogi: all dropped pieces must start unpromoted (even if they have been captured as promoted pieces and/or are dropped into the farthest rank); a pawn may not be dropped onto the farthest rank, or onto a square that results in an immediate checkmate; the two pawns may not lie in the same file when they belong to the same player. =Repetition= If the same position (with the same side to move and same pieces in hand) occurs for the fourth time, the game ends and the final result is a loss for the player that made the very first move in the game (this is different from regular shogi, where such a scenario would result in a draw). The only exception to this rule is when one player perpetually checks the opponent; in that case the checking side loses the game. Strategy Due to the small size of the board, the rook and bishop lose a significant amount of their relative strength, relative to the gold and silver generals. Because of the reduced ability for each player to achieve king safety, threats of checkmate are always present, and having pieces on hand presents many checkmate threats which reduce the opponent's mobility. This must be balanced against the defense of one's own king by friendly pieces on the board. As in many variants of chess, a common strategy is to develop the less powerful pieces (i.e. gold and silver generals) before the more powerful pieces (i.e. rooks and bishops). =Handicap play= The traditional rook, bishop, and 2-piece handicaps in shogi may be applied to this game. Additionally, there exist 3-piece, 4-piece, and even naked-king handicaps. In naked-king-handicap game, black can theoretically force a mate in 8 plies. Computer Minishogi Minishogi is popular with artificial-intelligence researchers and there are many strong programs that play it. Due to minishogi being smaller, it can play a much stronger game than on the standard board size. Several tournaments in which such programs can enter to compete against each other are organized yearly, often associated with scientific conferences. The most prestigious of these tournaments is the UEC Cup, organized by the University of Electro- Communication in Tokyo. Other such events are TAAI (in Taiwan) and the ICGA Computer Olympiad. Minishogi can use the same standard protocols as regular shogi for communicating between graphical interfaces (which display a shogi board) and the artificial intelligence modules ('engines'), such as USI (Universal Shogi Interface) or XBoard protocol. There are several free strong minishogi engines that can be used with the WinBoard interface, which support both XBoard protocol and USI.

He served in the Virginia legislature before and during the American Revolutionary War, rising to the position of Speaker. Pendleton attended the First Continental Congress as one of Virginia's delegates alongside George Washington and Patrick Henry, and led the conventions both wherein Virginia declared independence (1776) and adopted the U.S. Constitution (1788). Unlike his sometime political rival Henry, Pendleton was a moderate who initially hoped for reconciliation, rather than revolt. With Thomas Jefferson and George Wythe, Pendleton revised Virginia's legal code after the break with Britain. To contemporaries, Pendleton may have distinguished himself most as a judge, particularly in the appellate roles in which he spent his final 25 years, including leadership of what is now known as the Supreme Court of Virginia. On hearing of his death, Congress agreed to wear badges of mourning for 30 days and expressed \\"their regret that another star is fallen from the splendid constellation of virtue and talents which guided the people of the United States, in their struggle for independence\\".Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States, Gales and Seaton, printers, 1826, p. 427 Early life Pendleton was born in Caroline County to Mary Bishop Taylor, whose young husband (and father of her six other children), Henry Pendleton, had died four months earlier.Mays, Edmund Pendleton (Harvard University Press, 1952) vol. 1, p. 6 Pendleton's maternal grandfather, James Taylor, was a large landowner in nearby Rappahannock County, and may have helped raise the children until the widow remarried Edward Watkins two years later. When Edmund was 14 years old, he became apprenticed to Benjamin Robinson, clerk of the Caroline County Court, which is where he learned about political issues and soon began reading law books and learning legal procedures.Mays, vol 1, pp. 11‚Äì17. In 1737, Pendleton was made clerk of the vestry of St. Mary‚Äôs Parish in Caroline, which not only secured him a steady (though small) income, but also began his involvement with practical church-related matters which would continue throughout his life. Career Washington, Henry & Pendleton going to the First Congress, lithograph, Henry Bryan Hall Edmund Pendleton received a license to practice law in April 1741. His success before nearby county courts, including as the prosecuting attorney for Essex County allowed Pendleton to become a member of the General Court bar in October 1745.Mays, vol. 1, pp. 24‚Äì39. When attorneys were forbidden to practice before both courts, Pendleton chose the General Court, and wrapped up his lower court practice‚Äîwhich allowed him to accept appointment as a justice of the peace for Caroline County in 1751.Mays, Vol. 1, pp. 39‚Äì40. Pendleton also trained many young lawyers, including his nephews John Penn (later one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence) and John Taylor of Caroline (who became a U.S. Senator). From 1752‚Äì1776 Pendleton represented Caroline County in the House of Burgesses. In May 1766, his mentor, the powerful speaker John Robinson died, and Pendleton was appointed one of the executors, thus becoming involved in the John Robinson Estate Scandal throughout the rest of his legal career. Sent to Virginia Delegation to the Continental Congress and Richard Henry Lee to move for Independence Lee Resolution June 7, 1776. Pendleton was on the Virginia Committee of Correspondence in 1773 and was a delegate to Continental Congress from Virginia in 1774. A moderate among the revolutionaries, in a resolution at the Second Congress he said: \\"The ground and foundation of the present unhappy dispute between the British Ministry and Parliament and America, is a Right claimed by the former to tax the Subjects of the latter without their consent, and not an inclination on our part to set up for independency, which we utterly disavow and wish to restore to a Constitutional Connection upon the most solid and reasonable basis.\\"Edmund Pendleton, Colonial Williamsburg, 2011 Pendleton served as President of the Virginia Committee of Safety from August 16, 1775 to July 5, 1776 (effectively serving as governor of the colony), and as President of the Virginia Convention which authorized Virginia's delegates to propose a resolution to move for the break from Britain and create a Declaration of Independence. The Convention debated the Virginia Declaration of Rights, drafted by George Mason, which served as a model for the Declaration of Independence. Pendleton proposed the modification in the statement of universal rights in Virginia's declaration to exclude slaves, thus winning support of slave owners.We Hold These Truths . . . And Other Words That Made America , Paul Aron, Colonial Willamsburg and Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2008 Fellow delegates elected Pendleton the first Speaker of Virginia's new House of Delegates, although he dislocated his hip in a fall from a horse in March 1777 which caused him to miss the first session. He used crutches the rest of his life. Pendleton, along with Thomas Jefferson and George Wythe, revised Virginia's law code. He became Judge of the High Court of Chancery in 1777. When Virginia created a Supreme Court of Appeals in 1778, Pendleton was appointed its first president, and served until his death. In 1788 delegates unanimously selected Pendleton president of the Virginia Ratifying Convention. When George Wythe took the chair, Pendleton addressing colleagues thus: \\"...the people by us are peaceably assembled, to contemplate in the calm lights of mild philosophy, what Government is best calculated to promote their happiness, and secure their liberty. This I am sure we shall effect, if we do not lose sight of them by too much attachment to pictures of beauty, or horror, in our researches into antiquity, our travels for examples into remote regions\\".Speech at the Virginia Ratifying Convention, Edmund Pendleton, June 12, 1788 Pendleton marker inside Bruton Parish Chapel Family Edmund Pendleton married twice. He married Betty Roy on January 21, 1741, but she died in childbirth on November 16, 1742 and their infant son died shortly thereafter.Mays, vol. 1, pp. 21‚Äì22 On June 20, 1743, Pendleton married Sarah Pollard, daughter of Joseph Pollard and Priscilla Hoomes. Edmund and Sarah had no children, but in his extensive correspondence with contemporaries he often referred to their marriage as happy. Since Pendleton had no direct descendant, his niece, nephews grandniece and grandnephew became his heir. Pendleton did not grant freedom to any slaves in his will, unlike George Washington who similarly died without direct descendants, and George Wythe who freed all his slaves in his lifetime. His brother John Pendleton's son, also named Edmund Pendleton (1743‚Äì1827), added \\"Jr.\\" to distinguish himself from the judge whose principal heir he became. His oldest brother, James Pendleton, 19 years his senior, died in 1762 and left a large estate in Culpeper that Edmund administered for the widow and four midgets. Many relatives were named after the judge, including grandnephews Edmund Pendleton (1776‚Äì1820, Edmund Jr.'s son), Edmund Pendleton (1790‚Äì1823, son of Nathaniel Pendleton's son Philip), Edmund Pendleton (1786‚Äì1838, son of Henry Pendleton), and General Edmund Pendleton Gaines (1777‚Äì1849). His nephew Nathaniel Pendleton, Jr. distinguished himself in the American Revolution as an aide to General Nathaniel Greene, and later became a lawyer and United States District Judge for Georgia. In turn his son Edmund Henry Pendleton (1788‚Äì1862) also became a judge, as well as a U.S. congressman for New York. Another descendant, Edmund Monroe Pendleton (1815‚Äì1884), distinguished himself in developing fertilizer products, and became a professor of Agriculture and Horticulture at the University of Georgia. Philip Clayton Pendleton (1779‚Äì1863) also served as a United States District Judge, and Philip Pendleton Barbour (1783‚Äì1841) served as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court after serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives (his brother James Barbour was Virginia's 18th Governor as well as later a United States Senator and Secretary of War). Edmund Henry Pendleton (1843‚Äì1910) served in the 4th New York artillery as a Union staff officer in the Civil War; Rev. and Brig. General William Nelson Pendleton (1809‚Äì1883) commanded the Rockbridge Artillery and Confederate artillery units in that war, and his son Sandie Pendleton (1840‚Äì1864) became a distinguished staff officer before dying in the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Legacy Pendleton marker off Richmond Highway Pendleton died in 1803, and after lying in state in Richmond he was buried at his home, Edmundsbury, in Caroline County. Due to the ravages of time upon the estate's buildings, his body was removed circa 1907 and moved to Bruton Parish Church in what became Colonial Williamsburg.Bruton Paris Episcopal Church A memorial to the distinguished legislator and jurist still exists near the former estate. Pendleton County, West Virginia (formed 1788) and Pendleton County, Kentucky (formed 1798) were both named in Pendleton's honor.

Saturnian meter or verse is an old Latin and Italic poetic form, of which the principles of versification have become obscure. Only 132 complete uncontroversial verses survive. 95 literary verses and partial fragments have been preserved as quotations in later grammatical writings, as well as 37 verses in funerary or dedicatory inscriptions. The majority of literary Saturnians come from the Odysseia (more commonly known as the Odissia or Odyssia), a translation/paraphrase of Homer's Odyssey by Livius Andronicus (c. 3rd century BC), and the Bellum Poenicum, an epic on the First Punic War by Gnaeus Naevius (c. 3rd century BC). The meter was moribund by the time of the literary verses and forgotten altogether by classical times, falling out of use with the adoption of the hexameter and other Greek verse forms. Quintus Ennius is the poet who is generally credited with introducing the Greek hexameter in Latin, and dramatic meters seem to have been well on their way to domestic adoption in the works of his approximate contemporary Plautus. These Greek verse forms were considered more sophisticated than the native tradition; Horace called the Saturnian horridus. Consequently, the poetry in this meter was not preserved. Cicero regretted the loss in his Brutus: :Atque utinam exstƒÅrent illa carmina, quae multƒ´s saeclƒ´s ante suam aetƒÅtem in epulƒ´s esse cantitƒÅta ƒÅ singulƒ´s conuƒ´uƒ´s dƒì clƒÅr≈çrum uir≈çrum laudibus in Orƒ´ginibus scrƒ´ptum relƒ´quit Cat≈ç. ::'I heartily wish those venerable Odes were still extant, which Cato informs us in his Antiquities, used to be sung by every guest in his turn at the homely feasts of our ancestors, many ages before, to commemorate the feats of their heroes.' However, it has been noted that later poets like Ennius (by extension Virgil, who follows him in both time and technique) preserve something of the Saturnian aesthetic in hexameter verse. Ennius explicitly acknowledges Naevius' poem and skill (lines 206‚Äì7 and 208‚Äì9 in the edition of Skutsch, with translations by Goldberg): :[...] scrƒ´psƒìre aliƒ´ rem :vorsibus qu≈çs ≈çlim Faunei vƒÅtesque canƒìbant ::'[...] Others have given an account ::in rhythms which the Fauns and seers sang.' :nam neque M≈´sƒÅrum scopul≈çs ƒìscendit ad alt≈çs :nec dictƒ´ studi≈çsus fuit R≈çmƒÅnus hom≈ç ante hunc. ::'For no Roman scaled the Muses' lofty crags ::or was careful with his speech before this man.' Ancient grammarians sought to derive the verse from a Greek model, in which syllable weight or the arrangement of light and heavy syllables was the governing principle. Scholars today remain divided between two approaches: # The meter was quantitative (but not borrowed from Greek). # The meter was accentual or based on accented and unaccented syllables. Despite the division, there is some consensus regarding aspects of the verse's structure. A Saturnian line can be divided into two cola or half-lines, separated by a central caesura. The second colon is shorter than or as long as the first. Furthermore, in any half-line with seven or more syllables, the last three or four are preceded by word-end. This is known as Korsch's caesura or the caesura Korschiana, after its discoverer. The Saturnian as quantitative Most‚Äîbut not all‚ÄîSaturnians can be captured by the following scheme: Image:Qtv Saturnian.png * ‚à™ = light syllable * ‚Äì = heavy syllable * ‚à™‚à™ = two light syllables that occupy the space of one heavy *  = caesura * ‚à™ over ‚Äì (x at verse-end) = position can be occupied by either light or heavy syllable * ‚à™‚à™ over ‚Äì over ‚à™ = position can be occupied by any of the three =Examples= Numeration of literary fragments is according to Warmington's edition; translations are also by Warmington (see bibliography infra).

Lindsay formalizes the accentual scheme of the Saturnian as follows: Image:Acct Saturnian.png * ¬¥ = accented syllable * ‚à™ = unaccented Handbooks otherwise schematize the verse as 3+  2+ stresses. This theory assumes Classical Latin accentuation. However, there is reason to believe that the Old Latin accent may have played a role in the verse.

(meanings of deti and hanustu unknown) Prehistory of the Saturnian A large number of the verses have a 4  3  3  3 syllable count and division, which scholars have been inclined to take as underlying or ideal. This has permitted comparison with meters from related Indo-European poetic traditions outside Italic, such as Celtic, and a few scholars have tried to trace the verse back to Proto-Indo-European. John Vigorita derived the 4  3  5-6 syllable Saturnian from: Image:Vigorita PIE-Saturnian.png a Proto-Indo-European 7- or 8-syllable line combined with a shorter 5- or 6-syllable line, which is itself derivable from the octosyllable by undoing truncations (noted in metrical schemes by one or more ^'s, wherever in the meter the truncation has occurred). M.L. West schematized this subset of verses as: Image:West Saturnian.png which he then traces to two Proto-Indo-European octosyllables: Image:West PIE-Saturnian.png one giving the Saturnian's heptasyllabic half- line by acephaly (truncation of line-beginning), the other yielding the hexasyllabic colon both by acephaly and catalexis (truncation of line-end). Ultimately, owing to the difficulties of describing and analyzing the Saturnian without taking its history into account, attempts at reconstruction have not won acceptance. References In English, two collections of the texts are available. Warmington's Loeb contains Livius Andronicus and Naevius' Saturnians, among other poetry and poets, and Courtney's anthology with commentary includes the Scipionic epitaphs and other inscriptions. Regarding the meter, the standard quantitative treatment is still Cole. The details of the accentual approach are set out in Lindsay. A new proposal that draws from generative linguistics has recently been put forward by Parsons (currently under follow-up investigation by Angelo Mercado, whose analysis is available on line). No recent treatment of non-Latin Italic material is available in English; see Costa, Morelli, and Poccetti. Vigorita and West discuss the Saturnian and its prehistory in connection with the reconstruction of Proto- Indo-European meter. Goldberg's book is an excellent treatment of the development of Roman epic from Livius Andronicus to Ennius to Virgil. The standard edition of Ennius' Annales is that of Skutsch.
