It embraces both Islamic Studies and theology as well as history, geography, archeology and architecture. The project is an English project for change historical reality of al-Quds city. Change history and write a new history for al-Quds. Chance name of city for erase his history from minds of mew jeneration. The aim is make an Islamic Zionism like Christian Zionism for Muslim world. Chanced name of al Quds to IslamicJerusalem. But all Muslim known name of the city since 1000 years as al Quds al Sherif. The field Islamicjerusalem Studies is a relatively new field of academic inquiry concerned with the region known in Arabic as Bayt Al-Maqdis. Since its establishment in London in 1994, the founder of the field Professor Abd al-Fattah El-Awaisi, has encouraged promising academics to contribute to this endeavor by adopting and promoting a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach to the study of the region. The term Islamicjerusalem has three main elements: the land, its population, and a unique vision of inclusivity for the two.El- Awaisi, Abd al-Fattah, ‘Introducing Islamic Jerusalem’ (ALMI Press, 2006) Institutionalisation and development The field dates to the creation of ISRA (Academy for Islamic Jerusalem Studies) in 1994 in the United Kingdom. The Academy helped institutionalise the field in British higher education. The founder first taught a module at Undergraduate level entitled ‘Islamic Jerusalem’ at the al- Quds University and in the 1990s at the University of Stirling. This was followed by PhD candidates researching the field at Edinburgh, Strathclyde and Glasgow Caledonian Universities. The majority of the research emerged with the launch of the first institution dedicated specifically to the field of Islamic Jerusalem Studies, Al-Maktoum Institute in Dundee in 2001. The Institute supports original postgraduate research. It offers Masters and PhD programs in Islamic Jerusalem Studies accredited by the University of Aberdeen. Ten years later field started to expand beyond the United Kingdom, in particular within the Arab and Muslim World. Currently courses are offered in at universities in Egypt, Palestine and Malaysia. The Annual International Conference The first Annual International Conference took place in 1997. The 13 (as of 2010) Annual International conferences attracted distinguished scholars from around the world. The last conference took place at SOAS University of London in November 2010 and was entitled ‘Orientalist approaches to Islamic Jerusalem'. Publications The Journal of Islamicjerusalem Studies The lack of available academic literature led to the establishment of the first issue of Journal of Islamic Jerusalem Studies in the winter of 1997. The Journal brings together findings from archaeological, theological, historical and geographical studies and is published in Arabic and English. Islamicjerusalem Studies Series ISRA acknowledges the most innovative and creative research within the field through initiatives such as the Islamic Jerusalem Prize for Young Scholars and the Al-Maqdisi Award.Al-Ahlas, Aisha.

The relationship between CAC and environmental policy is considered in this article, an area that demonstrates the application of this type of regulation. However, CAC is not limited to the environmental sector and encompasses a variety of different fields. Definition Command and Control (CAC) Regulation can be defined as “the direct regulation of an industry or activity by legislation that states what is permitted and what is illegal”.McManus, P. (2009) Environmental Regulation. Australia: Elsevier Ltd. This approach differs from other regulatory techniques, e.g. the use of economic incentives, which frequently includes the use of taxes and subsidies as incentives for compliance.Baldwin, R., Cave, M., Lodge, M. (2011) Understanding Regulation: Theory, Strategy and Practice. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press The ‘command’ is the presentation of quality standards/targets by a government authority that must be complied with. The ‘control’ part signifies the negative sanctions that may result from non- compliance e.g. prosecution.Abbot, C. (2009) The Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions ACT 2008. Environmental Law Review 38 CAC encompasses a variety of methods. Influencing behaviour through: laws, incentives, threats, contracts and agreements. In CAC, there is a perception of a problem and the solution for its control is developed and subsequently implemented.Holling, C., Meffe, G. (1996) Command and Control and the Pathology of Natural Resource Management. \\"Conservation Biology. 10: 2. pp. 328-337.\\" In the case of environmental policy and regulation, the CAC approach strongly relies on the use of standards to ensure the improvements in the quality of the environment. The CAC approach uses three main types of standards. These are ambient standards, emission standards, and technology standards. Although these standards can be used individually, it is also possible to use the standards in combination. In fact, in most pollution control programs, it is the case where there is a combination of standards being implemented. Although environmental policy has a long history, a proliferation of policy making in this area occurred in the 1970s and continued to today. The CAC approach dominated policy in industrial nations during this decade because the general focus was on that of remedial policies rather than more comprehensive prevention techniques.Bocher, M. (2011) A theorectical framework for explaining the choice of instruments in environmental policy. \\"Forest Policy and Economics'. Elsevier Whilst many view CAC negatively, direct regulatory control is still used in many countries' environmental policy. Enforcement and compliance To deliver its objectives, direct regulation must ensure the highest level of compliance possible. This can be achieved through appropriate implementation and enforcement. Non-compliance to CAC regulation presents a serious challenge to its effectiveness The manner in which CAC is enforced differs between countries. For example, in the US, some regulators who are tasked with implementing CAC techniques are given rule-making powers. Whereas in the UK, regulatory standards are more commonly set by departments of government. This is achieved through both primary and secondary legislation which is subsequently exacted by regulatory bureaucracies. Regulation differs within countries as well, in the UK the current regulatory sanctioning system possesses variations between powers and practices among regulators.Macrory, R. (2006) Regulatory Justice: Making Sanctions Effective. Final Report Enforcement of CAC often involves the use of uniform sanctions, this can result in small businesses feeling the burdens of regulation more severely than companies of a larger size. Strengths and weaknesses of approach A CAC approach in policy is used for several reasons. It has been proposed that by imposing fixed standards with the force of law behind them, CAC can respond more quickly to activities which do not abide by the set standards. It also has benefits politically as the regulator (often the government) is seen to be acting swiftly and decisively. It is far from a problem free form of regulation, the 1980s in particular saw CAC subject to widespread criticism. A good number of the critics tend to favour market-based strategies and are often dubious of the merits of governmental regulatory approaches Some issues highlighted include: *Regulatory capture: The concern here is that the relationship between regulators and the regulated may lead to the interests of the public being neglected. In this situation it is possible for the relationship to become too close, leading to capture. This may result in the regulator protecting the interests of the regulated. *Legalism: Command and control has been accused of stifling competition and enterprise. It has been posited that this is an inevitable consequence of the inflexible and complicated rules that can be created by the approach. Over-regulation can result, which in turn can lead to ‘over-inclusive’ regulation. *Standard- setting: Selecting the appropriate standards when implementing a CAC regime is crucial if the regulation is to avoid causing detriment to those that it regulates. This is a challenging obstacle to overcome as the amount of information required can be severe. *Enforcement: This constitutes a very significant dilemma for a CAC regulatory approach. One of the key issues is the expense of enforcement, especially when a complex system of rules has been developed. There are also problems of scope. Critics of CAC often point to incentive-based regulation as an alternative with terms used such as smart regulation, management-based regulation, responsive regulation and meta- regulation. Possible benefits of this approach may include cheaper administration costs and a reduction in the risk of regulatory capture. However the view that incentive-based regulation is radically different from CAC has been scrutinised.FC Simon (2017). Meta-regulation in practice: Beyond normative views of morality and rationality. Routledge The advantages can be exaggerated, a complex system of rules is often necessary to allow an effective system, this can cause many incentive-based schemes to appear to replicate some of the characteristics of CAC. Inspection and enforcement may also be essential to prevent evasion of liability, again resembling CAC and possibly removing the posited benefits in terms of cost. While practices may be changed at a superficial level through the use of CAC, it may not be able to achieve the changes of behaviour necessary for more sustainable environmental practices.Gunningham, N., Grabosky, P. (1998) Smart Regulation: Designing Environmental Policy. USA: Oxford University Press. There are some commentators on the topic who prefer to use ‘direct regulatory instrument’ instead of ‘command and control’ instrument because of the negative connotations surrounding the term.Goulder, L., Parry, I. (2008) Instrument Choice in Environmental Policy. Review of Environmental Economics and Policy. 2: 2. pp. 152-174. Efficiency Much of the literature on regulatory instruments considers efficiency in terms of monetary costs. CAC has been labelled by many critics as ‘inefficient’ as a system that spends resources but generates little revenue.Gunningham, N., Sinclair, D. (2002) Leaders and Laggards: Next Generation Environmental Regulation. UK: Greenleaf Publishing Ltd. The cost of compliance is perceived to be high, which can result in costs that are higher than the sanctions for non-compliance. A summary of 10 studies demonstrated significant differences in cost between CAC and least cost alternatives.Tietenberg, Tom (1991) Economic Instruments for Environmental Regulation. \\"In: Helm, D., Pearce, D. (ed.) Economic Policy towards the Environment. Oxford: Oxford University Press.\\" Empirical data suggests that CAC regulations, especially government subsidies in agriculture,\\"Government Subsidies for Agriculture May Exacerbate Deforestation, says new UN report\\". Sustainable Development Goals. United Nations. 3 September 2015. Retrieved 17 August 2020. often fuel environmental damage, deforestation and overfishing in particular. Some have moved to defend certain aspects of a CAC approach, arguing against the commonly held belief that these regimes are inherently inefficient. Economics incentives are frequently referred to as a considerably more efficient approach to regulation. The most commonly used incentives in this method relate to tax. The administrative costs of tax collection can be understated. Advocates of incentives have been accused of making simplifying assumptions and not fully taking into account the costs of administrating tax systems.Cole, D., Grossman, P. (2002) Toward a total-cost approach to environmental instrument choice. 20. pp. 223-241. In some circumstances, CAC regulation can end up being a less costly option. Whilst economic instruments may act to reduce compliance costs, in certain cases their total costs may actually be higher, This may stem from the high level of monitoring that is required to make an incentivised method viable and successful. Environmental regulation Application The use of Command and Control in regulation involves the government or similar body to “command” the reduction of pollution (e.g. setting emissions levels) levels and to “control” the manner in which it is achieved (e.g. by installing pollution-control technologies). It has been argued that CAC has the potential to be effective under certain conditions. Often its effectiveness can be determined by whether the problem has a diffuse or a point source. A CAC approach is relatively compatible with point source and regulation of these can often achieve success. On the other hand, CAC struggles to appropriately tackle issues that have a diffuse, non- point source.Landy, M. Rubin, C. (2001) Civic Environmentalism: A new approach to Policy. Washington DC: George Marshall Institute Evans draws on the following example: “it is relatively easy to regulate the emissions from 10 large coal burning power stations in a single country, but far less easy to monitor the emissions caused by millions of motorists or the effluent discharges from tens of thousands of farms across the world.” In Environmental Policy, CAC is characterised by 3 different types of standards, the use of the standards is determined by various factors, including the nature of the environmental problem and the administrative capacities of the governing body:Ogus, A. (2004) Comparing Regulatory Systems: Institutions, processes and legal forms in industrialised countries. In: Cook, P., Kirkpatrick, C. Minogue, M., Parker, D. (Eds.) UK: Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd. *Environmental Standards. These are centrally driven standards. A legally enforceable numerical limit is often used to determine the 'standard', but the term can be used more broadly, describing more general rules about acceptability. *Target Standards. The condition of the environment into which the pollutant enters is central to these standards. It can be subdivided into ambient and receptor standards. Ambient standards set the targets that apply to the regulators and policy makers. Whereas Receptor standards apply to the regulated and state that a specified maximum level is not to be exceeded. *Performance Standards. These determine what releases of a pollutant into the environment are acceptable. It has been suggested that if compliance reaches appropriate levels, there may be a good degree of certainty of environmental results.Latin, H. (1985) Ideal versus Real Regulatory efficiency: implementation of uniform standards and “fine-tuning” regulatory reforms. Stanford Law Review. 37. 1267-1332. CAC regulation has the potential to lead to a more rapid resolution of certain environmental policy objectives. It may also provide clarity to those that are subject to the regulation. There may be a clearer understanding of what is required and how to meet those requirements. It has been argued that the use of the CAC approach to solve environmental problems can result in unexpected consequences if the application is conducted uncritically. Much of environmental policy to date has been associated with the term Disjointed Incrementalism. This term was coined by LindblomLindblom, C. (1979) Still muddling, not yet through. Public Administration Review. 517-526. and describes the small and often unplanned changes that have occurred in the field of environmental regulation. These changes in regulation often address small-scale problems with laws tuned towards the particular area of concern. This approach is criticised on the grounds that it does not take into account the wider causes of environmental issues. International environmental agreements =Montreal Protocol= The 1987 Montreal Protocol is commonly cited as a CAC success story at international level. The aim of the agreement was to limit the release of Chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere and subsequently halt the depletion of Ozone (O3) in the stratosphere. There were a number of factors that contributed to Montreal’s success, these included:Speth, J., Haas, P. (2006) Global Environmental Governance. USA: Island Press.Falkner, R (2005) The Business of Ozone Layer Protection: Corporate Power in Regime Evolution. In: Levy, D., Newell, P. (2005) The Business of Global Environmental Governance. pp. 169-196. Cambridge Mass & London: MIT Press. *The problem and solution were both clearly defined and supported by industry (albeit not initially) *The Ozone hole was easily measurable *There was an effective scientific lobbying alliance that played a key role in convincing the US Government and the commercial sector (in particular DuPont, then one of the largest manufacturers of CFCs) Defining this agreement as a CAC approach is slightly problematic as the agreement does not directly instruct states how to meet their targets. However, the aim of the Montreal Protocol has been to eliminate the source of CFC emissions, as a result the only really feasible way for a state to achieve this would be through a ban on substances related to Ozone depletion. Montreal is considered by some to be a 'special case' of a successful CAC approach. =Climate change= The traditional model of command and control typically involved areas of environmental concern being dealt with by national governments. In recent decades, transboundary environmental problems have risen in prominence. This shift has exposed many of the limitations of a command and control approach when it is applied to a larger and more complex arena.Evans, J. (2012) Environmental Governance. Elsevier. Climate change is often used to exemplify the perceived failings of this regulatory approach. Climate change is good example of a concern that is complex, full of uncertainties and difficult for many people to understand.Downie, D. (2005) Global environmental policy: governance through regimes. In: Axelrod, R., Downie, D., Vig, N. (Eds.) The Global Environment: Institutions, Law and Policy. 2nd ed. Washington DC: CQ pass. pp. 64-82. This may go someway in explaining the apparent incompatibility of climate change and a CAC approach. Mitigating climate change requires action of a much more proactive nature than traditional CAC models are able to deliver. One reason for the lack of compatibility with many international environmental agreements is the manner in which the international community is organised. International law cannot be implemented in the same way as law at national level.Hunter, D., Salzman, J., Zaelke, D. (2002) International Environmental Law and Policy. New York: Foundation Press Given that the CAC approach relies heavily on prohibiting certain activities and then enforcing it through sanctions makes the scaling-up to international level problematic. Without a strong international enforcement body it is unlikely that CAC will be an effective tool for dealing with most transboundary environmental issues, climate change included. Future of command and control regulation in environmental policy The international nature of many contemporary environmental issues makes CAC regulatory approaches difficult. Since the 1970s enthusiasm for the implementation of economic incentives for regulation has been on the increase. This is due, in part, to the disenchantment with command and control.Harrington, W., Morgenstern, R. (2004) Economic Instruments versus Command and Control. Resources. pp. 13-17. The shift away from CAC does not seem to be slowing, the increased participation of a variety of actors may be the answer. The role of environmental NGOs in policy making has changed drastically in recent decades. Their numbers and the influence they exert over national governments and negotiations at international level has risen. The involvement of NGOs has assisted the development of international policy in a number of ways. A great deal of environmental policy has been influenced by research collected by these organisations. They also act as whistleblowers, updating the regulators of progress and compliance. A blend of different approaches, involving a range of actors and regulatory types may be the best answer. However, it is likely that many governments will persist with CAC because of the political benefits and the fact that it is not always as inflexible and inefficient as many economists would suggest.McCormick, J.

In Germany, a regiopolis is a city outside the core of a metropolitan area, that serves as an independent driving force for development within a larger region. The concept is used to develop midsized urban regions within regional, national and global contexts. For its surrounding region, the terms regiopolis region and regiopolitan area can be used and may be shortened to regio (similar to metropolitan area and metro). The term regiopolis is a hybrid combination of the words region and polis (Greek: \\"city\\"), and is used in the context of urban and regional planning. It was developed by professors Iris Reuther and Jürgen Aring in Germany in 2006, with Rostock as the first model regiopolis.Prof. Dr. Iris Reuther (FG Stadt- und Regionalplanung, Universität Kassel): Präsentation \\"Regiopole Rostock\\". 11 December 2008, retrieved 13 June 2009 (pdf). To use and further develop their common potential, various cooperations between the regiopolis, its surrounding region, business partners and the closest metropolitan areas are fostered. Characteristics In contrast to a metropolis a regiopolis is a characterization of smaller scaled centers with a high functional importance for their hinterland. Thus they are mostly situated outside of metropolitan areas. Further characteristics are * The size (not the biggest city within a country, but a size that matters within the national context) * A good accessibility combined with a good infrastructure * A high economical importance * Location of global players and hidden champions * A concentration of an innovative potential * A university. These characteristics have mainly been developed within the German framework; it is aimed to develop them further within a European context.  Regiopolis Rostock  Rostock city harbour during Hanse Sail The first German city region to work with the regiopolis concept is Rostock. A taskforce with different actors such as the hanseatic city of Rostock, the administrative district of Rostock, the Regional Planning Association Mid Mecklenburg/Rostock and the local business organizations is working on the promotion of the concept. They aim to build up a national and a European network of regiopolis, comparable to the network of European Metropolitan Regions and Areas. Characteristics of the Rostock Regiopolis Location of the Rostock Regiopolis * Rostock is the urban center in between the metropolitan areas of Hamburg to the west, Szczecin to the east, Copenhagen-Malmö to the north and Berlin to the south; * Rostock region is the German gateway to the Baltic states, Russia and to Scandinavia; * Rostock is the economically strongest city of Mecklenburg- Western Pomerania; * Rostock Port is a major hub in Northern Germany; * more than 30 of the 100 biggest enterprises in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania operate in Rostock Region; * the oldest university in Northern Europe is located in Rostock; * Rostock is the biggest city in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, with more people moving in than moving out; * Rostock Region lies on the European axis connecting the Baltic and the Adriatic Sea; * Rostock is host to the annual “Hanse Sail” event; * Rostock is the major destination of city tourism in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania; * Rostock Region is a location within the “BioConValley” research network. Achievements * The concept of Regiopolis was developed at the University of Kassel in 2006; * Rostock was the first city to adopt the concept; * since 2009 it has been more and more widely discussed within the region; * the term is increasingly adopted by the federal and the state governments; * in 2009 the first congress of German Regiopolises was initiated by the Rostock Region; * in 2010 the first mayors’ conference of Rostock Region was held; * in 2011 an informal meeting of representatives of potential other regiopolises was held in Berlin; * in 2012 the agency of the Regiopolis has been established; * A cooperation agreement has been signed by the main partners of Regiopolis Rostock - City of Rostock, administrative district Rostock, chamber of commerce Rostock, Ministry for Energy, Infrastructure and Regional Development Mecklenburg Western Pomerania and the planning association Region Rostock. * In March 2013, the Regiopolis Rostock organized the workshop for “potential Regiopolises and other city- regions cooperation” in Berlin. * In April 2013, the festival regio:polis has been organized for the first time. It displays the plurality of arts and cultural events in the Regiopolis of Rostock. * A taskforce for the future development of the Rostock Regiopolis was established in 2013. * In 2014, the Regiopolis Rostock celebrated the regio:polis festival again, this time with partners from Guldborgsund Municipality (Denmark). * In 2015, the cities of Bielefeld and Paderborn started to adopt the concept.

Brian Ibsen, Larisa Peters, Andrew Loviska, Paul Cantu, Bill Johns, Adrienne MacIain, Andy Evans, Adam Gehrke, and Elissa Dowling star as survivors of a Mormon-themed zombie attack. Plot On Halloween in a small, sleepy town in Utah, David Driscoll and Jenny King, who are involved in a relationship gone cold, try to settle down for a romantic evening, but they are visited by two Mormon missionaries, who seem to suffer from a small affliction. David shrugs them off with a few bad jokes and tries to resume his evening plans when the Mormons ring again – this time, as blood-thirsty zombies, along with several others who begin to overrun their neighborhood. After escaping their door- callers when one of them recoils from a soda thrown in his face, David decides to see an acquaintance, a convenience shop and bar owner named Harry Linderman, who owns a double-barrel shotgun. They reach the shop, only to meet a youth named Darwin Nedry and his substance-sniffing friend Charlie Cooper, who tell them that Linderman left with his gun after a phone call reached him from his medieval-themed bar, The Drunken Dragon. Not knowing how to retrieve their little daughter Charlotte, who is staying out of the house this night, without a weapon, David and Jenny decide to stay in the store for the time being. Soon, however, an armed, gritty hunter named Boothe Gardener stages a dramatic entrance into the store and stays for the night as well, following his own close brush with the zombified Mormon population in which his friend Charlie was killed. Owing to the incident at his house door, David concludes that the zombies are vulnerable to things which are taboo to Mormons, including caffeine. When a zombie breaks into the store, Gardener is mortally wounded after he tries to fight it off using non-caffeinated soda. Darwin destroys the zombie with caffeinated soda. Forced to evacuate the store, David and company make for the Drunken Dragon but draw dozens of zombies. In the nick of time, they are led inside by armor-clad bartender Piper McKenzie, who tells them that Linderman was zombified during a zombie riot in the bar and is now kept locked up in a side room because she cannot bring herself to finish him. After discovering that Darwin keeps several explosive prank devices in his backpack, David devises a plan to reach Piper's car and get to his daughter by letting Linderman out, strapping the explosives and their scant soda supplies onto his back and using him as an involuntary suicide bomber to take out the zombies encroaching on the bar. The plan quickly goes awry when Linderman bites Darwin just after he is released, dooming him, before the youngster blasts his head with his own shotgun. Faced with no other choice, Darwin assumes the role of the bomber as a last heroic act, but he turns before he can light the fuse. Piper lights the explosives with a crossbow and fire arrow, but the blast proves too weak to take out all the zombies; before the door can be re-barricaded, the undead break into the bar and devour Piper alive, while Charlie faints. Retreating into the main taproom, David and Jenny fight and destroy the undead, but by retreating too far, Jenny is caught by a zombie breaking through a window and mortally wounded. After promising Jenny that he will find their daughter, David hugs her until she dies, decapitates her to prevent reanimation, and then kills the remaining zombies in a berserk rage. As morning dawns, David staggers off, filled with revenge, to finish the undead, with an unsure Charlie in tow. The film ends in some institution where a file labelled The Utah Project containing information about mutation warfare is presented to a group of boardroom-type people, followed by a file detailing an upcoming project ominously named The Vatican Solution. As the file courier exits the boardroom, the camera backtracks his path to the reception of an office building, where a receptionist answers a phone call with the words, \\"Thank you for calling Church of Scientology. How may we help you?\\" Cast Production The majority of the production was shot during the summer of 2007 and finished in 2009. The filmmakers did not single out Mormonism for any particular reason. The concept came from a joke during a brainstorming session, and one of the producers decided to develop it. Major influences include George A. Romero, Troma Entertainment, and Edgar Wright. Release The premiere of The Book of Zombie was on June 11, 2011, at Seattle's True Independent Film Festival. In October 2012, it was featured in the collection of zombie shorts Ultimate Zombie Feast, which was released in the UK. Reception HorrorNews.net called The Book of Zombie \\"one kick ass zombie film\\". Gareth Jones of Dread Central called the film \\"consistently funny and very entertaining\\". In a mixed review, academic Peter Dendle wrote that \\"not every gag in the horror-comedy hits home, but the boldness of the movie's premise goes a long way.\\" Awards The film won the audience award at Seattle's True Independent Film Festival.

Since most two-year colleges have open, non-competitive admissions policies, many students are admitted without college-level academic qualifications. Placement tests assess abilities in English, mathematics and reading; they may also be used in other disciplines such as foreign languages, computer and internet technologies, health and natural sciences. The goal is to offer low-scoring students remedial coursework to prepare them for regular coursework.Conley, David. \\"Replacing Remediation with Readiness\\" (working paper). Prepared for the NCPR Developmental Education Conference: What Policies and Practices Work for Students? September 23–24, 2010, Teachers College, Columbia University, p. 12. Less-prepared students are placed into various remedial situations, from adult basic education through various levels of developmental college courses. Historically, placement tests also served additional purposes such as providing individual instructors a prediction of each student's likely academic success, sorting students into homogeneous skill groups within the same course level and introducing students to course material. Placement testing can also serve a gatekeeper function, keeping academically challenged students from progressing into college programs, particularly in competitive admissions programs such as nursing within otherwise open-entry colleges. Test validity In the construction of a test, subject matter experts (SMEs) construct questions that assess skills typically required of students for that content area. \\"Cut scores\\" are the minimum scores used to divide students into higher and lower level courses. SMEs sort test items into categories of appropriate difficulty, or correlate item difficulty to course levels. \\"Performance level descriptors\\" define the required skills for remedial and standard courses.Morgan, Deanna. \\"Best Practices for Setting Placement Cut Scores in Postsecondary Education\\" (working paper). Prepared for the NCPR Developmental Education Conference: What Policies and Practices Work for Students? September 23–24, 2010, Teachers College, Columbia University, p. 12. Once in use, placement tests are assessed for the degree to which they predict the achievements of students once they have been assigned to remedial or standard classes. Since grades serve as a common indirect measure of student learning, in the customary analysis, a binary logistic regression is run using the test score as the independent variable, and course grades as the dependent conditions. Typically, grades of A, B or C are counted as successful, while grades of D and F are counted as unsuccessful. Grades of I (for an unconverted Incomplete) and W (a Withdrawal) may be considered unsuccessful or may be excluded from the analysis. Test scores are interpreted based on a proposed use and assessed in that context, rather than simply by establishing a predictive relationship between scores and grades. Since placement tests are designed to predict student learning in college courses, by extension they predict the need for developmental education. However, the efficacy of developmental education has been questioned in recent research studies, such as those by Bettinger and Long;Bettinger, E., and Long, B. T. \\"Remediation at the Community College: Student Participation and Outcomes.\\" In C. A. Kozeracki (ed.), Responding to the Challenges of Developmental Education.

One study found that one-quarter of students assigned to math remediation and one- third of students assigned to English remediation in the US would have passed regular university courses with a grade of at least a B without any additional support. The placement testing process Upon enrollment a student will be recommended or required to take placement tests, usually in English or writing, in math and in reading. Testing may also include a computer-scored essay, or an English-as-a-second-language assessment. Students with disabilities may take an adaptive version, such as in an audio or braille format that is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Advisors interpret the scores and discuss course placement with the student. As a result of the placement, students may take multiple developmental courses before qualifying for college level courses. Students with the most developmental courses have the lowest odds of completing the developmental sequence or passing gatekeeper college courses such as Expository Writing or College Algebra.Bailey, T., Jeong, D. W., & Cho, S. (2010). Referral, enrollment, and completion in developmental education sequences in community colleges. Economics of Education Review, 29, 255-270. Adelman has shown that this is not necessarily a result of developmental education itself.Adelman, Clifford (2006). \\"The toolbox revisited: Paths to degree completion from high school through college.\\" U.S. Department of Education. Student acceptance Many students do not understand the high-stakes nature of placement testing. Lack of preparation is also cited as a problem. According to a study by Rosenbaum, Schuetz and Foran, roughly three quarters of students surveyed say that they did not prepare for their placement tests.Rosenbaum, James E., Schuetz, Pam & Foran, Amy. \\"How students make college plans and ways schools and colleges could help.\\" (working paper, Institute for Policy Research, Northwestern University, July 15, 2010). Once students receive their placement, they either may or must begin taking developmental classes as prerequisites to credit-bearing college level classes that count toward their degree. Most students are unaware that developmental courses do not count toward a degree.Rosenbaum, J., Deil-Amen, R., & Person, A. (2006). After admission: From college access to college success. New York: Russell Sage Foundation. Some institutions prevent students from taking college level classes until they finish their developmental sequence(s), while others apply course prerequisites. For example, a psychology course may contain a reading prerequisite such that a student placing into developmental reading may not sign up for psychology until they complete the developmental reading requirement. Federal Student Aid programs pay for up to 30 hours of developmental coursework. Under some placement regimens and at some community colleges, low-scoring students may require more than 30 hours of such classes. History Placement testing has its roots in remedial education, which has always been part of American higher education. Informal assessments were given at Harvard as early as the mid-1600s in the subject of Latin. Two years earlier, the Massachusetts Law of 1647, also known as the \\"Old Deluder Satan Law,\\" called for grammar schools to be set up with the purpose of \\"being able to instruct youth so far as they shall be fitted for the university.\\"Massachusetts Trial Court Law Libraries http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/docs/DeluderSatan.pdf . Predictably, many in- coming students lacked sufficient fluency with Latin and got by with the help of tutors who had graduated as early as 1642.Wright, Thomas Goddard (1920). Literary culture in early New England, 1620-1730. New Haven, CT: Yale UP, Ch. 6, p. 99. https://web.archive.org/web/20051025080258/http://www.dinsdoc.com/wright-1-6.htm In 1849 the University of Wisconsin established country's first in-house preparatory department. Late in the century, Harvard introduced a mandatory expository writing course, and by the end of the 19th century, most colleges and universities had instituted both preparatory departments and mandatory expository writing programs. According to John Willson,Willson, J.M. (1931). A study of an objective placement examination for sectioning college physics classes. Thesis submitted to the faculty of the School of Mines and Metallurgy of the University of Missouri, p. 5. http://scholarsmine.mst.edu/thesis/pdf/Willson_1931_09007dcc8073add4.pdf > The chief function of the placement examination is prognosis.

It should indicate to the student something of the preparation he is > assumed to have made for the work upon which he is entering and introduce > him to the nature of the material of the course. Historically, the view that colleges can remediate abilities that may be lacking was not universal. Hammond and Stoddard wrote in 1928: \\"Since, as has been amply demonstrated, scholastic ability is, in general, a quite permanent quality, any instrument that measures factors contributing to success in the freshman year will also be indicative of success in later years of the curriculum.\\"\\"A Study of Placement Examinations.\\" University of Iowa Studies in Education. Charles L. Robbins, Editor. Volume 4(7) Published by UIA, Iowa City, p9. Entrance examinations began with the purpose of predicting college grades by assessing general achievement or intelligence. In 1914 T.L. Kelley published the results of his course-specific high school examinations designed to predict \\"the capacity of the student to carry a prospective high school course.\\"Kelley, T. Educational Guidance: An Experimental Study in the Analysis and Prediction of High School Pupils. Teachers College, Columbia University, Contributions to Education. No. 71. The courses were algebra, English, geometry and history, with correlations ranging from R =.31 (history) to .44 (English). Entrance examinations and the College Entrance Examination Board (now the College Board) allowed colleges and universities to formalize entrance requirements and shift the burden of remedial education to junior colleges in the early 20th century and later to community and technical colleges.Boylan, 1988 Policies Required placement testing and remediation was not always considered desirable. According to Robert McCabe, former president of Miami-Dade Community College, at one time \\"community colleges embraced a completely open policy. They believed that students know best what they could and could not do and that no barriers should restrict them....This openness, however, came with a price....By the early 1970s, it became apparent that this unrestricted approach was a failure\\"McCabe, Robert H. (2000). No One to Waste: A Report to Public Decision-Makers and Community College Leaders. Washington, DC: Community College Press, p. 42. Examples of state or college placement testing policies: * Placement testing using state approved tests is required (or encouraged) for all student (or all students taking classes for credit, or all new students taking classes for credit) * Students must meet approved cut scores to gain access to specific courses * Placement testing waived for students demonstrating college readiness via admissions tests (typically high scores on ACT or SAT tests, such as 21 plus or minus in relevant subjects on ACT, and 500 plus or minus in relevant subject areas on SAT), other approved placement tests, or previous college coursework in math and English * Students allowed/required to retest after/within a certain length of time (sometimes for a fee). * Students must begin remedial coursework within a specified time period. * Before testing/retesting students are encouraged/required to review study guides or complete a review course. * Cut score levels, roles and reviews are described. * Remedial students encouraged/required to take diagnostic assessments before/during their coursework * Integration of criteria beyond test scores into remediation decision-making. * Requiring completion of Students may not register for college level classes until they have completed all (or certain) prescribed remedial courses * Defining remedial prerequisites such as placement test score or remedial coursework for specific courses. Alternatives Testing other elements of student ability Conley recommends adding assessments of contextual skills and awareness, academic behaviors, and key cognitive strategies to the traditional math, reading and traditional tests Boylan proposes examining affective factors such as \\"motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety.\\"Saxon, Patrick; Levine-Brown, Patti; & Boylan, Hunter. \\"Affective Assessment for Developmental Students, Parts 1 & 2.\\" Research in Developmental Education, 22(1&2), 2008, p. 1. Alternative test formats In 1988, Ward predicted that computer adaptive testing would evolve to cover more advanced and varied item types, including simulations of problem situations, assessments of conceptual understanding, textual responses and essays.Ward, William C. \\"Using Microcomputers for Adaptive Testing,\\" in Computerized adaptive testing: The state of the art in assessment at three community colleges.\\" League for Innovation in the Community College, Laguna Hills, CA, 1988 Tests now being developed incorporate conceptual questions in multiple choice format (for example by presenting a student with a problem and the correct answer and then asking why that answer is correct); and computer- scored essays such as e-Write, and WritePlacer. In a Request for Information on a centralized assessment system, the California Community Colleges System asked for \\"questions that require students to type in responses (e.g. a mathematical equation)\\" and for questions where \\"Students can annotate/highlight on the screen in the reading test.\\"\\"CCCAssess Proof of Concept Report 2011: Centralizing Assessment in the California Community Colleges.\\" California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, Telecommunications and Technology Division, Sacramento, CA, 2011, pp. 30, 33. Some massive open online courses, such as those run by edX or Udacity, automatically assess user-written computer code for correctness. Diagnostic placement testing Placement testing focuses on a holistic score to decide placement into various levels, but is not designed for more specific diagnoses. Increasing diagnostic precision could involve changes to both scoring and test design and to better targeted remediation programs, where students focus on areas of demonstrated weakness within a broader subject. \\"The ideal diagnostic test would incorporate a theory of knowledge and a theory of instruction. The theory of knowledge would identify the student's skills and the theory of instruction would suggest remedies for the student's weaknesses. Moreover, the test would be, in a different sense of the word from what we have previously employed, adaptive. That is, it would not subject students to detailed examinations of skills in which they have acceptable overall competence or in which a student has important strengths and weaknesses—areas where an overall score is not an adequate representation of the individual's status.\\" Test preparation A controversy exists over the value of test preparation and review. Test publishers maintain that their assessments should be taken without preparation, and that such preparation will not yield significantly higher scores. Test preparation organizations claim the opposite. Some schools have begun to support test preparation. The publishers' claims are partly based on the theory that any test a student can prepare for does not measure general proficiency. Institutional test preparation programs are also said to risk washback, which is the tendency for the test content to dictate the prior curriculum, or \\"teaching to the test\\".Robb, Thomas N., & Ercanbrack, Jay. (1999). \\"A Study of the Effect of Direct Test preparation on the TOEIC Scores of Japanese University Students.\\" TESL-EJ, 3(4). Various test preparation methods have shown effectiveness: test-taking tips and training, familiarity with the answer sheet format along with strategies that mitigate test anxiety.Perlman, Carole L. (2003). \\"Practice Tests and Study Guides: Do They Help? Are They Ethical? What Is Ethical Test Preparation Practice?\\" Measuring Up: Assessment Issues for Teachers, Counselors, and Administrators, ERIC, 12 pages. Some studies offer partial support for the test publishers' claims. For example, several studies concluded that for admissions tests, coaching produces only modest, if statistically significant, score gains.Briggs, Derek C. 2001. \\"Are standardized test coaching programs effective? The effect of admissions test preparation: Evidence from NELS:88. Chance, Vol. 14,(1) pp 10-21.Scholes, Roberta J., & Lain, M. Margaret. (1997). \\"The Effects of Test Preparation Activities on ACT Assessment Scores.\\" Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, Chicago, IL. March 24–28, 22 pages. Other studies, and claims by companies in the preparation business were more positive.Buchmann, C., Condron, D. J., & Roscigno, V. J. (2010). \\"Shadow Education, American Style: Test Preparation, the SAT and College Enrollment.\\" Social Forces, 89(2), 435-461. Other research has shown that students score higher with tutoring, with practice using cognitive and metacognitive strategies and under certain test parameters, such as when allowed to review answers before final submission, something that most computer adaptive tests do not allow.Rothman, Terri, & Henderson, Mary. (2011). \\"Do School-Based Tutoring Programs Significantly Improve Student Performance on Standardized Tests?\\" Research in Middle Level Education Online, 34 (6), p1-10.Shokrpour, N., Zareii, E., Zahedi, S. S., & Rafatbakhsh, M. M. (2011). \\"The Impact of Cognitive and Meta-cognitive Strategies on Test Anxiety and Students' Educational Performance.\\" European Journal of Social Science, 21(1), 177-188.Papanastasiou, E. C. (2005). \\"Item Review and the Rearrangement Procedure: Its process and its results.\\" Educational Research And Evaluation, 11(4), 303-321. Other research indicates that reviewing for placement tests may raise scores by helping students to become comfortable with the test format and item types. It also might serve to refresh skills that have simply grown rusty. Placement tests often involve subjects and skills that students haven't studied since elementary or middle school, and for older adults, the might be many years between high school and college. In addition, students who attach a consequence to test results and therefore take placement tests more seriously are likely to achieve higher scores.Napoli, Anthony R., & Raymond, Lanette A. (2004). \\"How Reliable Are Our Assessment Data?: A Comparison of the Reliability of Data Produced in Graded and Un-Graded Conditions.\\" Research in Higher Education, 45(8), 921-929. According to a 2010 California community college study, about 56% of colleges did not provide practice placement tests, and for those that did, many students were not made aware of them. In addition, their students \\"did not think they should prepare, or thought that preparation would not change their placement.\\"Venezia, A., Bracco, K. R., & Nodine, T. (2010). One-shot deal? Students' perceptions of assessment and course placement in California's community colleges. San Francisco: WestEd. http://www.wested.org/online_pubs/OneShotDeal.pdf By 2011, at least three state community colleges systems (California, Florida, and North Carolina), had asked publishers to bid to create customized placement tests, with integrated test reviews and practice tests. Meanwhile, some individual colleges have created online review courses complete with instructional videos and practice tests. Simulations In \\"Using Microcomputers for Adaptive Testing,\\" Ward predicted the computerization of branching simulation problems, such as those used in professional licensing exams. Secondary/tertiary alignment Since placement testing is done to measure college readiness, and high schools in part prepare students for college, it only makes sense that K-12 and higher education curricula be aligned. Such realignment could take many forms, including K-12 changes, collegiate changes or even collaboration between the two levels. Various efforts to improve education may undertake this challenge, such as the national K-12 Common Core State Standards Initiative in the United States, Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC), or the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC). As of 2012 neither kind of alignment has progressed to the point of close coordination of curriculum, assessments, or learning methodologies between public school systems and systems of higher education. Recently, state legislatures (including California, Florida, and Connecticut) passed a series of mandates to redefine developmental curricula. This was done in response to diminishing four-year graduation rates in college. Succeeding in a college course requires students to fulfill a multitude of tasks in order to demonstrate their competency in a given class. Frederick's Ngo's study of Multiple Measures further criticized the use of placement tests by considering that “college readiness is a function of several academic and non-academic factors that placement tests do not adequately capture” . Furthermore, Belfield and Crosta's 2012 study establishes “positive but weak association between placement test scores and college GPA” . Defining key skills and attributes that lead to college success cannot be simply extrapolated from performance on a single placement test. Scott-Clayton claims “it is easier to distinguish between those likely to do very well and everyone else than it is to distinguish between those likely to do very poorly and everyone else” . This exacerbates the issue of the placement test as it highlights the fact that those who do well on the placement test have a high probability (with high predictive validity) of succeeding in college-level coursework. Meanwhile, those who do poorly on the placement test aren't necessarily put on a trajectory that has predictive validity. Regardless, those who start in remediation, end up becoming victims to the vicious cycle of being stuck in remediation.

He primarily plays as a left-back or left midfielder. Career AS Monaco Born in Les Ulis, France, to a Cameroonian mother, Dingomé began his football career at US Palaiseau as a youth before being spotted by Monaco when he was fifteen and joined the side. He spent five years in the youth setup before being promoted by Laurent Banide to the first team in Ligue 2 after the club was relegated. Dingomé made his professional debut on 17 October 2011 in a league match against Guingamp, as they lost 4–0. He scores his first goal with Monaco in a French cup match against Alès. On 18 January 2012, he scored his first professional league goal against Amiens in a 2–1 win, in which he turns out to score a winning goal. However, new arrivals in the January transfer window saw Dingomé’s first team place fallen behind in the pecking order and fight for his place despite having more playing time. Despite this, Dingomé signed a new contract with the club that kept him until 2015. Until the end of the 2011–12 season, he went on to make 25 appearances scoring once in all competitions. In the 2012–13 season, Dingomé missed the start of the season, due to injury. He made his first appearance of the season on 23 August 2012, in a 3–0 win over Arles-Avignon. But his season saw him on the sidelines, as he continued to find himself behind the pecking order. After making 19 appearances in all competitions in the 2012–13 season, Monaco were promoted back to Ligue 1 after two-year absence. Dingomé signed another contract extension, that will keep him until 2016. Shortly after that, Dingomé joined Le Havre on a season long loan and was given number 12 shirt. He made his Le Havre debut on 9 August 2013, where he came on as a substitute, in a 1–0 loss against Clermont Foot. Under the management of Erick Mombaerts, Dingomé's playing time increased and he made 30 appearances. Mouscron-Péruwelz On 17 July 2014, Dingomé left Monaco for the newly promoted Belgian Pro League side Royal Mouscron-Péruwelz prior to the 2014–15 season. He rejected a permanent move to Le Havre in favour of joining Mouscron-Péruwelz. Dingomé made his Mouscron-Péruwelz debut in the opening game of the season against Anderlecht, where he came on as a substitute in the 55th minutes, and seven minutes later, he set up a goal for Anice Badri, in a 3–1 loss. Since joining the club, he became a first team regular for the side. It wasn’t until on 26 October 2014 when Dingomé scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–2 draw against Lokeren. He scored his second goal for the side on 22 November 2014, in a 2–1 win over Lierse. On 9 May 2015, against Westerlo, Dingomé captained the side for the first time and set up a goal for Zinho Gano, in a 1–1 draw. In his first season at the club, he went on to make thirty–three appearances and scoring two times in all competitions. In the 2015–16 season, Dingomé started the season well when he scored in his first appearance as captain, in a 3–1 loss against Mechelen on 8 August 2015. Dingomé captained the side in the next two matches for the side. However, he soon found himself in the sidelined, due to injury. Despite this, the club opted to take up their option of a contract extension that would ensure Dingomé’s stay until 2017. He finished the 2015–16 season with 20 appearances scoring once in all competitions. Troyes In July 2016, Dingomé signed a two-year contract with Troyes AC of Ligue 2. He was previously linked with a move to Standard Liège but joined Troyes instead. Dingomé made his Troyes debut in the opening game of the season, in a 3–1 loss against Sochaux. In a follow–up match, he scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–1 loss against AC Ajaccio. However, he was soon sidelined with suspension and injury. He made his return from injury on 13 January 2017, starting the whole game, in a 2–1 against AC Ajaccio. Since returning to the first team from injury, Dingomé regained his first team place for the side. He then scored two goals in two matches between 17 March 2017 and 31 March 2017. In a match against Auxerre on 5 May 2017, Dingomé scored and set up one of the goals, in a 3–2 win. In his first season at Troye, he went on to make thirty–five appearances and scoring four times in all competitions. In the 2017–18 season, Dingomé continued to be in the first team regular for the side. He then captained the side on two occasions, which both came against Olympique Lyonnais on 22 October 2017 and Strasbourg on 4 November 2017. However, in November 2017, he suffered a cruciate ligament tear during a 3–0 win over Angers. This sidelined him for the rest of the season. At the end of the 2017–18 season, Dingomé went on to make fourteen appearances in all competitions. Stade de Reims It was announced on 29 June 2018 that Dingomé joined Reims, signing a three–year contract. The move reported to cost €1m transfer fee. However, he continued to remain in the sidelined, due to injury, but continued to train to recover from his injury. It wasn’t until on 28 October 2018 when Dingomé made his Stade de Reims debut, in a 2–0 win over Stade Rennais. However, his return was short–lived when he suffered from an injury during a 2–0 loss against Saint-Étienne on 10 November 2018.

From the beginning the project was very ambitious – the films were accompanied not by a mere piano but by the Pavilion Symphony Orchestra, and a sophisticated lighting system created colour effects during the films – such as blue lights for rain, or red for fire. The interior was classical in style, using 3 shades of copper, and seated 2,000 spectators.http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/ShepherdsBushEmpire.htm It had no less than 2 miles of carpet and solid silver lamps for lighting, and was awarded a Bronze Medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects.Denny, p.99 A work drawing of the building WW2 Much of the sumptuous interior work would be lost when the building was badly damaged by a flying bomb in 1944, towards the end of World War II, and the original interior was destroyed.Denny, p.101 Modern era and decline After the war The Pavilion was repaired (though not entirely to the original design), and reopened in 1955 as the Gaumont Theatre. It was then closed again in 1969 for further refurbishment, when a new floor was installed, dividing the large open space into two levels – a cinema upstairs and a Bingo Club below. In 1974 the Pavilion acquired a new status as a Grade II listed building although, given the war damage and subsequent alterations, little remained of the original interior design or layout. In 1983 the cinema closed for the last time, leaving the bingo hall open for a while longer. However, in 2001 even the bingo hall closed, and the building fell into disuse. Redevelopment as a hotel Shepherd's Bush Pavilion Hotel Under Construction in May 2013 Shepherd's Bush Pavilion 10 December 2013 Shepherds Bush Pavilion in March 2014 In both 2004 and 2006 planning permission was given for conversion into a hotel, but investors withdrew from the project owing to the difficulty of converting the building, in particular the relatively small number of rooms, few of which would have enjoyed any natural daylight or views. The building was left unoccupied and in disrepair for several years, prompting English Heritage to add it to its 'Building at Risk' register. In 2009 planning permission was granted to convert the empty building into the 4 star Shepherds Bush Pavilion Hotel, designed by architects Flanagan Lawrence. At the end of February 2012 it was reported that the £25 million conversion of the derelict building would begin in March 2012. In the summer of 2012 the building was largely demolished, retaining only the original facade. When completed the hotel would have 11 floors, and the existing curved roof would be replaced by a glass roof. In September 2012 a planning variation was requested by the developers, to change the proposed development from a 242-room hotel to one with 322 smaller rooms. The proposed variation was opposed by local residents who feared that the fundamental character of the new building would be quite different from what was originally proposed. The new hotel is to run by the Asia-based hotel group Dorsett Hospitality International, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It opened in June, 2014.

Duprez (14 March 1833 – August 31, 1902) was an American minstrel show performer and manager. He is best known as one of the principals of the Duprez & Benedict's Minstrels, which was a highly popular American minstrel group in the late 1860s and 1870s. Life Duprez was originally from France, according to his naturalization record on 29 July 1887 Lowell, Massachusetts and began performing minstrel shows in 1852 in New Orleans, with a group that became known as Carle, Duprez and Green's Minstrels. By 1858, this group was known as Duprez and Green's, until Green retired in 1865. Lew Benedict (who had joined the group in 1861) bought out Green's share, and the group became known as Duprez & Benedict's Minstrels, which became well known across the United States. Benedict left the group in 1876, but Duprez maintained the group until about 1885, and then purchased the Washington Tavern hotel in Lowell. His effort to revive the hotel's fortunes were unsuccessful, but he continued to work in different capacities in the area's hotel business and operating rides at local amusement parks. Shortly before he died, he was running the \\"boat merry-go-round\\" at Crescent Park in Providence. Duprez died of heart failure at the Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island on August 31, 1902. 1902 obituary reports stated that he was 65 years old at the time of his death, but Edward Le Roy Rice's 1911 Monarchs of Minstrelsy reports that Duprez was born in Paris, France on March 13, 1830.(4 September 1902).

Early life  Sam Frazier, Jr. was born in a mining town of Edgewater, Alabama, United States, a small mining community near Birmingham. His parents were Teretta and Sam Frazier, Sr. Sam had four sisters and one brother. His father was a coal miner and many of the stories he brought home influenced his career as a songwriter and performer. After observing the hard life his father endured, the one thing Sam knew that he did not want to be was a coal miner. To help earn money for a growing family, Sam's mother would hold big back yard barbecues on Friday night...which most times lasted until early Saturday morning. Although it was illegal, she operated a \\"shot house\\", selling liquor from the home. As a result of the large crowds that the barbecue and liquor sales drew, entertainers started coming by and playing for the crowd for donations, free barbecue and liquor. Sonny Boy Williamson was a regular and Jimmy Reed also came by. Sam was fascinated with the harmonica and it was Williamson who gave Sam his first harmonica and gave him a lesson in blues harmonica technique. When there were no entertainers, a \\"Rock' Ola\\" juke box provided the music. Sam attended Edgewater Elementary school through 9th grade. At the tenth grade level, he attended Westfield High School. At the age of 17, Sam went to stay with his Uncle Willie Perry in Linden, Alabama. His Uncle managed a large plantation. It was here that Frazier got a real taste of country living, complete with picking cotton, bailing hay, and milking cows. While in Linden, Sam attended and completed high school at Linden Academy.  Career  To earn extra money, he worked part-time at a local restaurant. One of his co-workers knew somebody who knew somebody who played in a blues band. Sam auditioned for the band and promptly was hired to play harmonica and sing. Some three months later, Sam moved back to Birmingham. But, he was bitten by the music bug. He started playing as a one-man band, playing guitar and blowing the harmonica. He added a bass drum and hi-hat which he played with his feet. He taught his sister to play bass and she started performing with Sam at parties and local clubs. While playing at a club, he caught the ear of a popular local Birmingham DJ, \\"The Thin Man\\", Maurice King. Maurice arranged an audition with a talent agent who took Sam and his sister to New York City and recorded his first record entitled \\"You Got Me Uptight\\". The session took place at a studio on Broadway. The 45 rpm single was released and received moderate airplay and success. While in New York City, Sam and his sister performed at the Sonia Ballroom. Eventually Sam came back to Birmingham and joined a gospel group, \\"The Golden Hummingbirds\\", where he played bass and sang. He also formed a three piece combo and played at the DAV (Disabled Veterans) and American Legion for a period of time. Although the music was a lot of fun, Sam needed a job to support himself with a regular income. He got a job at a local auto dealership where one of the salesmen introduced Sam to a local morning TV show host, Country Boy Eddie. Eddie was a well known celebrity entertainer who eventually hired Sam as one of the regular members of his traveling entourage; making appearances at local shopping malls, new car dealership grand openings and other venues. It was around that same time that country music had just discovered Charley Pride, the first black singer to make it big in country music. Eddie encouraged Sam to pursue country music in addition to the blues music he was known for. Sam also became a regular on The Country Boy Eddie TV Show on WBRC TV, a Birmingham, AL station. Some of the members of the band entered Sam in a contest at \\"Sonny Duke's Night Club\\". Sam not only won the contest, but went on to perform at Sonny Duke's as a regular for five years. Then Sam met Joe Mitchell. Joe owned Missile Records and recorded 12 songs with Sam in Nashville. One of the songs, \\"Cabbage Man\\", was released as a single and received a good amount of airplay.  1970s  In 1970, Sam recorded several songs that were released on Neal Hemphill's Goodie Train record label out of Birmingham, Alabama. Although Sam was not signed as an exclusive artist to that label, Goodie Train released \\"Take Me Back\\", \\"Set Me Free\\", \\"I've Been Hurt\\", \\"Don't Spread Your Love Around\\", \\"Momma Said She Ain't Here\\", \\"Drippin' Honey\\", and \\"I Don't Want Another Love\\". In 1974 Sam went to Nashville and auditioned to appear on the nationally syndicated TV show, \\"You Can Be A Star\\". He was selected to perform and Sam won the first round of competition singing the song \\"An Old Chunk of Coal\\". The level of competition was rather stiff. Another contestant on the show was Alan Jackson. Sam appeared on two of the shows and the show was primarily a country music show.  1980s  While in Nashville, Sam also appeared at \\"Fan Fare\\". Sam was spotted by a talent agent who booked him to appear at Gilley's Supper Club in Pasadena, Texas. Also on the venue at Gilley's was Gene Watson, a legendary country artist. Sam's first big foray in the blues arena came in 1987. Sam booked a session at Sound of Birmingham recording studios in Birmingham, AL and over a six-month period, he and studio owner/producer Don Mosley finished an entire album which was released on the \\"Blue Rock\\" label out of Torrence, California. In support of that release, Sam moved to California and appeared on showcases around the state. While in California, Sam also performed with Johnny Otis in \\"The Johnny Otis Revue\\".  1990s  On a return visit to Birmingham, Sam met record producer Fred Sollie, the owner of an independent record label, Sollie Sunshine Records. Fred signed Sam to a two-year contract. Over that period of time, Fred and Sam co-wrote eight songs. Out of that collaboration came the song \\"Forty Acres of Hillside Mountain Land\\" which was released in 1991 and became a No.1 hit on the independent record charts. The second release, \\"Momma Kept The Lamp Light Burning\\", received international airplay and can be found on radio station play lists as far away as Australia. Also released was \\"A Road Walked By Fools\\", \\"Crying Melody\\" and \\"Leaving You Would Be A Sin\\".  2000s-present  Frazier appeared for a number of years with tribute artist Gilbert Gauthier in Las Vegas, Nevada. Gilbert performed tribute shows to Neil Diamond and Frank Sinatra. Frazier, however, always appeared as himself. In 2006, he moved back to Birmingham to attend to family matters. Shortly after his return, his older sister and younger brother died. Since that time, Frazier worked steadily on a new blues project with producers Don Mosley and Les Alexander at the Sound of Birmingham Studios in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2017, Music Maker released the album, Take Me Back, containing 16 tracks.  References  * Mosley, Don (July 25, 2011) \\"Sam Frazier, Jr..

Lewis graduated from Eastern Kentucky University after transferring from South Suburban College, where he played his first two years of collegiate basketball. High school Lewis was a three-year letterwinner at Long Streamwood High school. In the 2009/2010 season, he won the Class 4a All State award and was a member of the Fox Valley All Area Team while helping lead Streamwood High School to the 2010 Upstate 8 sectional. He averaged 18 points and 11 rebounds per game his senior year and as a junior, Lewis tallied 16 points and 4 rebounds per game. He was also a first-team all-Fox Valley pick in 2009.  Collegiate career  Marcus Lewis began his collegiate career by accepting a scholarship to the University of Portland, a member of the West Coast Conference. Over two season with the Pilots, Lewis averaged 9.7 points and 5.7 rebounds. He was named to the West Coast Conference All-Freshman Team, while playing in all 30 games in 2005 after and averaging 9.1 points and 5.6 rebounds. Lewis had a career-best 14 rebounds against San Francisco as a freshman. As a sophomore, Lewis averaged 10.5 points and 5.8 rebounds in 21 games and scored in double figures 25 times. He also double-digits in rebounding eight times and scored a career-high 21 points in the 2005-06 season-opener against Georgia Southern. Marcus Lewis transferred to Oral Roberts University for the 2006/2007 season. As required by NCAA regulations, he was not allowed to play and therefore was a \\"red-shirt\\" player. He did practice with the team. His junior year, Lewis was named to the Summit League All-Newcomer team. He ranked among Summit League leaders in rebounding (9th) and field-goal percentage (7th). Lewis began the season on the bench but emerged as a force after a 28-point effort against Texas A&M-Corpus; Christi in the NIT Season Tip-Off. Oral Roberts was 22-6 with Lewis as a starter. He scored in double figures 13 times and reached double-digit rebounds five times, including a stretch of four consecutive efforts in February. In the Mayor's Cup Tournament, Lewis Scored 21 points with 8 rebounds in the win over Tulsa. Lewis became a starter his senior year and started all 31 games of the season. He was a leader on both ends of the court and finished the season averaging 13 points, 7 rebounds, 2 assists, 1 block and 1 steal per game, while shooting 59% from the field.  NBA D-League  Lewis signed with the Tulsa 66ers for the 2009/2010 season. He was used sparingly during his rookie year, as he only played 15 minutes per game, averaging 4 points and 3 rebounds.

Lewis decided to give one more push for the NBA and started the 2011/12 season off strong. Through the first six games of the season, he grabbed 76 rebounds making him the #1 rebounder in the NBA Development League. Before he could play the 7th game of the season, Lewis was called up to the Milwaukee Bucks for training camp. At the time his stats were 16 points, 13 rebounds, 2 assists and 1 steal per game.  Abroad  On May 2012, he signed a contract until the season end with Trotamundos de Carabobo, a team from Venezuelan top basketball division.

In 3 games, Lewis remained scoreless, but averaged 5 rebounds, 2 assists and 1 block per game, including an impressive 9 rebound performance in 23 minutes against the Indiana Pacers.  NBA  On December 10, 2011, the Milwaukee Bucks announced Marcus Lewis on their training camp roster and signed him to a one-year, non- guaranteed contract.  Team USA  During the summer of 2011 and in the midst of an NBA Lockout, Team USA made the unprecedented decision to use D-league players to play in the Pan American Games. Lewis was one of the 12 players selected and contributed almost immediately. With 12 seconds to go in the first game of the tournament, Lewis blocked 2 shots and hit the game-winning free throw, to give Team USA a 77-76 over the Dominican Republic. Over the next four games Lewis would average 8 points and 5 rebounds in a very balanced effort by Team USA.

In 2014 he received the Gusi Peace Prize - considered as the equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize in Asia - for Peacebuilding thru development of political & diplomatic networks & activities supporting human rights & fundamental freedoms.. In 2015 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. His candidacy was supported by both the OPCW (Nobel Peace Prize 2013) and the CPI. Early life Dominique Hoppe was born in 1959 in Longwy (France). He studied at the Lycée Alfred Mézières, went to the Nancy-Université and graduated from the Institut d'études politiques de Paris. He also graduated from the Stanford University and the Harvard Business School. Career In 1984, he started his career as international civil servant at the European Patent Office. After an internal career at EPO, he became Vice President of the AFIF-PB in 2000 and President in 2006. He was nominated President of the AFFOI in 2007 and President of the Superior council of international civil servants in 2008. Under his presidency the AFFOI has published its Manifesto for the support of linguistic, cultural and conceptual diversity within international organisations,; created the AFFOI for the youth,; launched the interviews of the AFFOI; and organised the Day of the French language in international organisations, events that happen when the head of states of the 77 countries of the official Francophonie meet, every second year. In October 2012 he was invited as an expert at the Summit of Kinshasa where he presented a plan for diversity that was supported by many heads of international organizations including Irina Bokova, Director-general of UNESCO, José Ángel Gurría, Secretary general of the OECD, Pascal Lamy, Director general of WTO, Ahmed Uzumcu, Director general of OPCW, Michel Jarraud, Secretary general of WWO, Philippe Couvreur, Secretary general of ICJ and Benoit Battistelli, President of EPO. This plan opened new ways to defend diversity within multilateral environments. In 2011 he mentioned for the first time the principal of \\"Anthropocracy\\" which he further defined in 2013. In October 2013 he launched the ACFOI and the AJFOI that became the two operators of the AFFOI under the umbrella of a broader body: AFFOImonde (AFFOIworld). In June 2012 he made the closing speech of the 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. This speech has been described as both inspirational and visionary by Song Sang-hyun President of the ICC. In 2013 he was associated -during the acceptance speech given by the Director general of the OPCW - to the Nobel peace prize received by the organisation. In 2016, worried by the increasing desire of self governance of international institutions, he included \\"Sovereignty of States in both the governance and the management of International organizations\\" as a priority on the roadmap of the AFFOI. Other activities He is member of Mensa since 1994. He gives conferences and courses on Management of multicultural environments at Harvard Business School and Sciences Po . Paris and on the need of linguistic, cultural and conceptual diversity in the functioning of international organisations to a broad range of multilateral institutions (United Nations (UN),. the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the International Criminal Court (ICC), the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the European Space Agency (ESA), Europol and Eurojust, etc..). Dominique Hoppe also writes articles in the French press (e.g. Le Monde,. le post,. and technical reviews .). Dominique Hoppe is also Vice President of DLF, that is governed by the French academy and board member of several human rights related groups. In 2014 he co-created - with the painter Christian Wind - the artistic movement \\"Vent et Esppoir\\" (Wind and Hoppe).. Both artists adhere to this anti-elitist idea that artistic expression is a gift to all; a natural way to explore other states; a tool to express emotions. Inspired by the spirit of the Cobra movement, they decided to combine their talents, to mix, to cross and use the synergistic effect to explore slopes inaccessible to separated arts. The artist doesn’t work towards a goal but to thrive. One comes back to oneself to better open to others. Perfection is no longer a goal but a possibility. The multidimensional representation of artistic expression resulting from this collaboration not only increases the flavor of the works, it also overcomes the artistic hermeticism that too often prevents free access to a non-expert public. Wind and Hoppe then becomes a political gesture, an attempt to democratize art. In 2016 he published the book \\"Poètes du monde pour la langue française et la Francophonie\\". written by numerous poets coming from 53 different countries.

In 1995, the Philippine government adopted CBFM as a national scheme to promote sustainable forest governance, in recognition of the negative impacts occurring as a result of widespread forest loss across the country. The scheme stresses the importance of involving communities in sustaining the forest through projects such as timber harvesting, agro- forestry and livestock raising. CBFM therefore advocates an increasingly ‘bottom up’ – as opposed to the historically ‘top down’ and centralised - approach to sustainable forest governance involving a variety of stakeholders. By 2005, 5503 projects had been established across the country. For this reason the Philippines has been considered a pioneer within Asia for the successful implementation of CBFM as a nationwide tool of forest governance. CBFM has resulted in varying levels of success across the country, primarily due to unstable policies, poor policy implementation and a lack of funding and assistance by the local and national governments. Successful projects tend to a result of strong government backing, strong community will to succeed in sustainable forest management, and international funding and technical assistance. The varying degree of success implies that many challenges still remain if CBFMs objectives are to be successfully achieved on a national scale. In addition, uncontrollable levels of deforestation remains a problem in the Philippines, with current forest cover at 25.7% and many rural and upland communities still well under the poverty line. History and origins CBFM in the Philippines emerged as a result of several driving forces including ‘forest and environmental degradation’ and ‘inequitable access to forest resources and benefits’. These can be attributed to the historically unsustainable forest management practices adopted by centralised governments. Forest cover in the Philippines has declined significantly from 92% in 1575 to 24% in 2003. Under the centralised forest management regime of Ferdinand Marcos between 1970 and 1980, annual deforestation was particularly high at 300,000 hectares. As a result of this deforestation, the Philippines had one of the highest forest losses in the Asia-Pacific region at the turn of the century. The large extent of forest loss in the country can be illustrated by the change from the country being a “major exporter of tropical logs in the late 1950s until 60s to now being a major importer of wood and wood products”. The centralised forest management policies formed within the pioneering period (1975–1986) are thought to have “primarily benefited the privileged few instead of the millions of people living in upland areas who depend on the forests resources for survival”. The Marcos government placed a third of the total forest in the country (8-12 million ha) under the control of 450-470 big companies with Timber Licence Agreements (TLA) whilst the “indigenous were regarded as squatters in their own lands... and were treated as culprits for forest destruction”. Widespread poverty ensued in the upland communities that rely on the forests for maintaining their livelihoods. The negative impacts of the centralised approach to forest control led civil society to strongly advocate a shift in the control of local resources to communities who could benefit socio-economically from as well as manage the forest more suitably. The government responded to these calls for a more people-orientated forestry programme by issuing executive order no.263 in 1995. This was titled “adopting community-based forest management as a national scheme to ensure the sustainable development of the country’s forest lands resources and providing mechanisms for its implementation”. Under this order, local communities can obtain long term tenure rights to forest land and resource use permits (RUPs) from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), provided that they employ environmentally friendly, ecologically sustainable and labour- intensive harvesting methods. Communities under CBFM are to elect a people’s organisation (PO) to represent a particular project in talks with other stakeholders. Some of the practices that communities have engaged in under CBFM range from agro-forestry and timber harvesting to livestock raising. The government aimed to place at least 9 million hectares of forests under CBFM by 2008. Case studies YISEDA The Young Innovators for Social & Environmental Development Association (YISEDA) - a group of 34 local men  was formed under CBFM in 1993 to promote the sustainable use of the forests in the province of Southern Leyte by protecting natural forests and promoting reforestation efforts. The area has witnessed rapid forest loss mainly through illegal logging and therefore was a prime target for the CBFM scheme. Under CBFM, communities were “taught to cut down indigenous trees and to sustain plantation areas for the harvest of timber”. The DENR tenure rights allow the communities to harvest the trees from the 34 hectare plantations that they themselves have set up. The success of the initiative was limited by a lack of government investment in the beginning, although investment from Deutsche Gesellschaft for Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) - a German government agency - has been vital to YISEDA’s success. GIZ provided YISEDA with a 5-year reforestation plan along with the funding (P5 million) and technical assistance to implement the plan. NPPFRDC The Ngan, Panansalan, Pagsabangan Forest Resources Development Cooperative (NPPFRDC) emerged from CBFM as a scheme to promote the sustainable harvest of timber and improve social justice. NPPFRC is located in Compostela in Southern Philippines which was awarded CBFM in 1996, giving them “the rights and responsibilities to manage and protect 14,800 ha of forest land”. In 2004 the NPPFRC totalled 324 members - which including associated families - totalled to 1,051 people being dependent on the coop’s activities and success. The cooperative themselves created a management framework under which “535 ha (5%) out of the 11,113 ha of production forest, with an estimated timber volume of 21,400 m3, will be harvested over the next five years”. The coop’s success relies on strong relationships between the communities and other actors including the local government, log buyers and the Community Environment and Natural Resource Office (CENRO). Successes The successes of CBFM in the Philippines have been limited by the fact that, in the minds of the people, CBFM was only a ‘project’ instead of a long-term forest management scheme. Therefore, as projects finished, much of the initiatives that had gone into the schemes were terminated. One project which is hailed as a great success from the Philippines CBFM initiative is the case study of YISEDA. The entitlement of land to manage has successfully altered the mindset of the communities involved to care more for the importance of the forests in which they live instead of degrading them. The YISEDA managed to overcome economic hardship in the beginning due to lack of government funding to maintain protection of the forest. This was partly because the communities started to see the economic and livelihood benefits of protecting and sustainably managing the forest. The government of the Philippines recognised the initial success of the YISEDA by entrusting its members another 150 ha of CBFM land to manage. The community themselves are promoting the long term sustainability of the project through education of their youth so the scheme can be successfully run for generations to come. Development funding of P5 million from GIZ played a big part in the long term success of YISEDA who, by 2001 started to reap the rewards of their hardship with a harvest of 66 hardwoods at a cost of P5,000 each. Across the country, the scheme has established 5503 projects covering an area of approximately 6 million hectares by 2005. According to Pulhin, a number of studies have found that the projects have added to the sustainability of the projects by increasing forest cover, making technological advances and improving relations between actors through collective action. Failures Numerous failures surrounding the implementation of CBFM have occurred across the Philippines. Despite the few successes - such as the YIDEDA - many communities under CBFM schemes have come across numerous challenges in achieving the goals and objectives of the scheme as detailed below: *Unstable policies:The limited and potentially short-term success of nationwide CBFM schemes including the NPPFRDC was mainly thought to be as a result of “unstable and restrictive forest policy”. The DENR have the power to suspend resource use permits (RUPs) which allow CBFM schemes to extract and utilise forest resources inside the designated area. When this occurs widespread loss of livelihood and forest destruction ensues. The impact of three RUP suspensions on the NPPFRDC caused major disruption of operations and resulted in economic losses of around $2.4 million in 2003 alone. In addition, unemployment increased forcing many locals into illegal logging to maintain their livelihoods. More seriously, however, over 1000 CBFMs were cancelled by the DENR nationwide by 2003, resulting in loss of livelihood and forest destruction in former CBFM areas in the Philippines. *Restrictive policies:Stipulated in the agreements made between YISEDA and the government, “YISEDA can only cut down trees from plantation areas measuring at least 30 centimetres in diameter”. For this reason it is only recently that the trees planted in the early 1990s by YISEDA could be harvested and sold on the market. Before this the YISEDA had very little income on which to maintain their livelihoods, and were strongly relying on the uncertain future success of the CBFM. *Lack of government funding and technical assistance:The poor technical assistance can be explained by the insufficient numbers of qualified technical staff at DENR in the early years with the knowledge required to assist CBFM projects. YISEDA struggled at first, having to motivate members to help with reforestation even though it lacked technical knowledge on agro- forestry and funding from DENR. Eventually, economic and technical assistance was provided by GIZ, and YISEDA thrived, but otherwise the chances of succeeding would have been much more unlikely. The NPPFRDC has had to bear the brunt of many of the costs themselves which has significantly inhibited their progress. *Reliance on International assistance:The government has been criticised for its inability to see CBFM projects through in the long run with the removal of funding too soon. A number of CBFMs would have not succeeded if it wasn’t for international funding and technical assistance, such as that provided by GIZ in the YISEDA scheme. GIZ provided not only funding but also a clear plan of action for forest regeneration which the YISEDA scheme lacked previously due to poor guidance by DENR. *Site to site variances in support:As evident in the case studies of YISEDA and NPPFRDC, there are disparities in the level of success that CBFM has had, suggesting that the level of support given to a project is highly dependent on location. As a result, this has led many to doubt the effectiveness of CBFM as a national tool for sustainable forest management. Challenges that remain “Despite wide coverage of areas devolved to local communities, totalling close to 6 million ha, current nationwide outcomes of state-initiated national community forestry programs and projects in the Philippines are still far from achieving their stated objectives”. Challenges remain within all aspects of CBFMs if these objectives are to be met in the future; from strengthening the weakening support by government policies to challenges within the community to ensure that benefits are sustained after the projects are completed. The NPPFRDCs success is dependent on these developments in the near future Governments must allow CBFMs to have increased formal involvement in the decision-making process and policy changes that can impact positively on their lives. Additionally, at a local level “strategic interventions are still needed to achieve the social justice and equality objectives of CBFM” thus addressing the observation in some projects that the community elites and educated are benefiting the most.

Up to two Sparrow; and two, theoretically four or six, Sidewinder missiles were carried on all the hardpoints except the central (underbelly), or seven 340 kg (750 lb) bombs (normally, two-four 227–340 kg/500-750 lb). Range was up to 1,250 km (777 mi) with four tanks, ferry range 2,940 km (1,827 mi).Sgarlato 2004 Aircraft allocated to air defence missions had their 20 mm (.79 in) M-61 Vulcan cannon removed. The F-104S was cleared for a higher maximum takeoff weight, allowing it to carry up to 7,500 lb (3,400 kg) of stores; other Starfighters had a maximum external load of 4,000 lb (1,814 kg). With four under wing drop tanks range was up to 780 mi (1,250 km). Production of the F-104S totalled 286, with the Italian Air Force taking delivery of 246 and the Turkish Air Force receiving 40 aircraft. F-104S-ASA (Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma – \\"Weapon Systems Update\\") – An upgraded F-104S, 147 were modified from existing airframes, with Fiat R21G/M1 radar with frequency hopping, look-down/shoot-down capability, new IFF and weapons delivery computer, and provision for AIM-9L all-aspect Sidewinder and Selenia Aspide missiles. Due to the delays of Aspide integration, the initial version, with Raytheon AIM-7 Sparrows was designated ASA-1. When the Aspide became available, all F-104Ss were upgraded to ASA-2 standard. First flown in 1985 the F-104S-ASA was principally an air-defence aircraft without enhancements to ground attack capabilities and were later modified to interceptor standards (CI) with removal of the 20 mm (.79 in) M-61 Vulcan cannon. F-104S-ASA/M (Aggiornamento Sistemi d'Arma/Modificato – \\"Weapon Systems Update/Modified\\") – 49 F-104S-ASA and 15 two-seat TF-104G aircraft upgraded from 1998 to ASA/M standard with GPS, new TACAN and Litton LN-30A2 INS, refurbished airframe, and improved cockpit displays. All strike-related equipment was removed, including the IRST (the small unit known as 'IR-Sight', forward the windshield). The last Starfighters in combat service, the F-104S-ASA/M was withdrawn in October 2004 (the last unit being 10° Gruppo/9° Stormo, Grazzanise), and temporarily replaced by F-16 Fighting Falcons, whilst awaiting delivery of Eurofighter Typhoons.

It covers the whole northeast portion of Kishtwar district bordering Zanskar (Ladakh) on the north, Pangi, Himachal Pradesh on the East and Marwah-Wadwan on the West. The valley is known for its sapphire mines. It lies in the Greater Himalayas, along the Chenab River basin. It is among the most remote regions of Jammu and Kashmir. There are various sub valleys in Paddar like Machail, Ghandari, Kabban, Ongai, Bhuzunu, Barnaj, Bhuzas, Kijai Nallah, and Dharlang, among others. History No concrete material is available about the early history of Paddar. However, it is said that there was no one in Paddar until the 8th century. It was just a meadow. The people from nearby areas such as Bhaderwah, Lahaul, and Ladakh were attracted to see the grazing lands. They used to come here to graze their cattle. With the passage of time, they settled there permanently. Paddar was under Guge rule, during the 10th century. It remained under their rule till the 14th century. After the 14th century, Paddar got separated from Guge rule and divided into smaller parts. These parts were ruled by smaller Petty Ranas (Rana is an Old Hindu word for a ruler who is less in Power than a Raja). The Ranas of Paddar were Rajputs, every village or every two or three villages used to have a Rana who often fought against the next village Rana. The area was inhabited mostly by Thakur community. People were serpent worshipers but they observed other Hindu rites and rituals as well. One can see temples of different Nagdevtas or Serpent Gods which are adorned with wood carvings of snakes of many forms. Besides Hindus, there are also Muslims and Buddhists. The Buddhists are spread in the upper reaches of the Machail, Kaban, and Gandhari valley and in the Town of Gulabgarh. The first Muslim came to Paddar during the period of Shantar Kantar Rana from Chamba who used to make the pots of soil. The descendants of those Muslims are still living at Atholi and Kijai. In the middle of the 17th century A.D, Chattar Singh, the king of Chamba also attacked Paddar. He first conquered Pangi from where he advanced with about 200 men to Paddar and annexed it. He constructed a fort after his name as well. The local Ranas could not face the onslaught of Raja Chattar Singh. They accepted his suzerainty and became his tributaries and began to work as his Kardars. The impact of Chattar Singh's conquest lasted long, and Paddar area continued to be the part of Chamba up to 1836. From Chattar Singh's period onward, Paddar remained comfortably under the kings of Chamba for five to six generations. Under the leadership of Ratnu Thakur, the people of Paddar attacked Zanskar in 1820 or 1825 (Zanskar was with a Bhot Raja under Ladakh). He made it his tributary. The Bhot Raja agreed to pay Rs. 1000, besides musk bags and other things annually as Nazar (present) to the Chamba Raja. As soon as General Zorawar Singh reached Kishtwar, he heard of an uprising in Ladakh, and hence, left for Ladakh via Zanskar. From this route, Leh is 275 miles from Kishtwar, which is the shortest route between these two places. Zanskar area falls en route Bhot Nullah. The army of Gen. Zorawar Singh entered Zanskar (Ladakh) through Paddar. This time wazir Lakhpat Rai Padyar, who was a trusted officer of Gulab Singh, also joined Zorawar Singh in the second attack on Ladakh. After conquering Ladakh, a part of the Army was sent to Kargil and Zanskar under the command of Wazir Lakhpat Rai and Col. Mehta Basti Ram as Zanskar was not under them till then. After conquering Zanskar, the army returned to Jammu through Paddar. 30 soldiers of Dogra army were kept in Chattar Garh fort to keep in touch with the soldiers fortified in Zanskar. During this period a rebellion broke out in Zánskar and the Dogra soldiers present there were massacred. On hearing the news, Ratnu Thakur, who was the highest employee of Chamba government, instigated people and caught hold of Dogra soldiers. Some of them were made prisoners and sent to Chamba. This made Gen. Zorawar Singh mad with rage. He intended to attack Paddar. In 1836, General Zorawar Singh along with 3000 soldiers, attacked Paddar from Zanskar through Bhot Nullah route. To escape from the onslaught, frightened Ratnu demolished the bridge on Chenab. For this reason, the Dogra army had to wait for three months. With the help of some local peasants they made a ropeway bridge and crossed the Bhot Nullah and led a furious attack on Chattar Garh. The whole town was set on fire. It was heaps of stone all around. Many people were hanged some were disfigured. A new fort was built in place of Chattar Garh. An officer along with a few soldiers was stationed there for the watch of the fort and Paddar became a part of dogra state. Ratnu was arrested and sent to Jammu, where he remained under detentions for three to four years. Subsequently, he was released and granted an estate in Kishtwar. Those days, Paddar was under the Tehsildar of Bhardarwah. After conquering Paddar Gen, Zorawar Singh went to Zanskar via Umasi La (Dharlang) about 17,370 feet from sea-level to quell the rebellion there. He succeeded in establishing peace. In 1837, a fierce rebellion broke out in Leh and Gen. Zorawar Singh covered the journey from Kishtwar to Leh in about ten days. In May 1838, Zorawar Singh got a fort built at Chisoti (Paddar) on his way back to Kishtwar. In 1845, during the rule of Maharaja Gulab Singh, both Paddar and Zanskar were given the status of tehsil. Later on, when Leh got district status, Zanskar was merged with Leh and Paddar was merged with Kishtwar tehsil during the period of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. In 1963, Paddar was given the status of a block by the government of Jammu and Kashmir. Now, it enjoys the status of a sub-division with two tehsils namely Atholi and Machail. Religion Hinduism is the largest religion in Paddar, followed by over 83% of people. Buddhism is the second-largest religion with 9.46% adherents. Islam and Sikhism form 6.8% and 0.05% of the population respectively. Villages *Kirthai - Is the amongst the first village while you enter into Paddar. The village lies in green paddy fields surrounded by river Chenab on one side and dense forest on the other side. It is 58 km from District headquarters and epicentre viz a viz symbol of cultural ethos. *Gulabgarh - It is the Sub-Divisional headquarter of Paddar and hub of all activities that happen in the area. It has a sizeable market area, a TRC (Tourist Reception Area) and all the transport services run from here, be it to the Kishtwar town or towards Pangi, Himachal Pradesh. It also plays host to all the local cricket tournaments that are organised here, besides these, there are many government offices, J&K; Bank, Police station and Rest houses. *Atholi - It is known for its very scenic spot called Pathaal and a water mill (locally known as Ghiraat). There is also a waterfall in the village. Tehsildar's office, sub-district hospital, Higher Secondary School, Girl's High School and Degree college are the important establishments here. *Tatta Paani - This village is known for its natural hot springs *Sohal - This village is used by off-roaders and as a base camp to Chitto, Kannan and Ongayee villages. *Gandhari - This place is visited by mountaineers, hikers and climbers and known for green pastures. Its first village Bhatwas is about 30 km from the sub-divisional headquarters Gulabgarh, 25 km road is motorable and the rest has to be travelled by foot. The trek route from here goes to Machail Paddar,Zanskar in Ladakh,and Pangi, Himachal Pradesh. As per Sanskrit language, Gandhari means a girl from Gandhara. Gandhari is a prominent character in the Indian epic, the Mahabharata. She was a princess of Gandhara and the wife of Dhritrashtra, the blind king of Hastinapura, and the mother of a hundred sons, the Kauravas. A place of the holy shrine of Maa Chandi, Shiva temple, Nag temple, and Gompa Monastery of Buddhists. A spot for a picnic, touring and adventuring, situated at a height of near about 9000 ft above sea level. Gandhari Valley consists of Six villages in which three are Hindu one and the rest three are Buddhist's one *Haloti and Hangoo - This is the nearest revenue village to the Machail Mata shrine.

It is still present in Saint Savin-en-Lavedan after a major restoration that took place in 1855. It is unclear whether Bernard I d'Escors was the first Abbot from 940-944 AD as it appears in some documents, or even if he was a member of the clergy. In the Saint Savin-en Lavedan's Meillon and Duriers' cartulaires, he is not listed as the first Abbot, and they even raise doubts about his existence. However, it is known that Bernard was possibly associated to the Abbey from 945-957 AD through records of his various donations in favour of the Convent.Monographie de Saint-Savin de Lavendan.

It was built between 2004 and 2008 at a cost of about $3 million, or $4,285 per kilowatt of power. Background Before the power plant was opened most people had no electricity, using wood or kerosene for cooking. Those who could afford it used diesel generators to provide electricity. The Zambian national electricity grid ends from the Ikelenge area. The local people were trapped in a poverty cycle, living through unsustainable slash-and-burn subsistence farming. The Zengamina project aimed to provide a reliable electrical supply with a small hydroelectrical station on the Zambezi River at a fast-moving point close to its source. The Zambezi at this location drops over a length of rapids. The potential for power generation on the Zambezi rapids was identified in 1964, but without funding nothing was done. In 2001 Dr Peter Gill, an orthopaedic surgeon in the United Kingdom, launched a trust to fund the project. The primary motive was to reduce the cost of providing electricity to the Kalene hospital, which serves people in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as Zambia, in a period when diesel fuel costs were continuing to rise. The Zambian government provided some seed funding, and church groups in Britain managed to raise another $2.5 million to cover construction costs. Construction  Construction of the facility began in March 2004. The project was initiated by the North West Zambia Development Trust, a small charity associated with the mission station at Kelene Hill. Construction mostly used local labour, with little machinery. This included building a weir, canal parallel to the river leading to a headpond, penstock, powerhouse building and tailrace. The electrical system includes a cross-flow turbine, a 400 V/33 kV step-up transformer, of 33 kV line and of 400 V line. The take-off weir is low, has little impact on the river and causes no risk to flora or fauna. The facilities are inconspicuous and require little effort to maintain. Most of the construction was of mortar and masonry using local granite that had been blasted to clear the canal. This approach greatly reduced costs, while making the structure blend with its surroundings. A local community school and church were also built using materials, transport and expertise provided for the hydro project. The project was officially commissioned on 14 July 2007 by President Levy P. Mwanawasa. By mid-2008 the project was operational, supplying electricity to the hospital. A larger transformer was being installed, after which other customers would come on stream. There is potential to double capacity by installing a second turbine. Significant extensions are needed for the grid to meet all the people who want power. Benefits Once operational, the power station supplied Kalene Hospital with sustainable green power, as well as the local clinics, the Kalene Farm orphanage, schools and 1,000 houses. Many benefits are expected from the improved power supply over and above the improvements in medical and educational facilities. Small and medium enterprises are expected to form, such as pineapple canning, increasing employment. The power will support improved drinking water and sanitation systems, raising levels of health. Better lighting at night will help students and allow for evening work, and so on.

She ended up in Sweden, where she met the Swedish competitive figure skater Tom Sjögren, at a university in Stockholm. In 1983, after graduating from college, the couple married. They emigrated to New York City in 1996. In 1999, Tina and Tom Sjögren (known as T&T;) summited Mount Everest, becoming the second married couple to do so. They then broke the record of high altitude broadcasting. In November 2002, they were the first to broadcast live pictures and sounds from the Antarctic ice cap. On February 2, 2002, they reached the South Pole after 63 days of skiing. On 29 May 2002, just four months after having returned from Antarctica, they reached the North Pole completely autonomously at record speed (118 days), and transmitted the first ever live broadcast of satellite images and sounds from the Arctic pack ice. In addition to traveling together, spouses Tina and Tom are also business partners and co-founders of ExplorersWeb.com, a business that provides news about expeditions via a network of websites, technical advice, and software, and rents and sells equipment. Through their ExplorersWeb.com subsidiary, HumanEdgeTech, the Sjögrens developed the software called Contact, which allows users to send images, video clips, and text directly to their Web pages, eliminating the need to send an e-mail message or attachment to a webmaster or other intermediary, to make posts or uploads.

He later studied at Budapest's College of Theatre and Drama, leaving in 1957 soon before finishing, after a fellow student and a teacher of his were imprisoned following the 1956 Revolution; Moldova was not awarded his degree. Both during his college studies and after, he also held a range of jobs—as a furnace repairman, miner, gardener, canning factory worker, and teacher in reform schools. Starting in 1958 Moldova worked for years as a screenwriter and playwright, making little headway in the former pursuit but seeing his plays staged in theaters to considerable success. His stories had been appearing in literary journals and anthologies since 1955. In addition to his many books and plays over the decades, Moldova has published numerous pieces in the Budapest satirical biweekly Hócipő since 1989. In the early 1990s he also wrote weekly pieces for the Budapest daily newspaper Magyar Hirlap. Moldova's writing is characterized by a concern for the central issues of everyday life, action, and characters who count as solitary, everyday heroes—with his nonfiction steeped in a tradition comparable to the New Journalism. His nonfiction books in particular, often on matters of practical concern to millions of Hungarians, have made him a household name. While occupying the fringes of Hungary's traditional literary establishment, Moldova is held in much esteem as a writer by readers from all sectors of Hungarian society, including some who otherwise take exception to his outspoken leftist/communist sympathies.  Foreign responses  Moldova György in Downtown Budapest As for foreign responses to his work, the English-language translation of Moldova's book on the invention of the ballpoint pen (New Europe Books, 2012) has elicited comments from outside of Hungary, including: \\"Ballpoint reads like a fast-paced mystery. Although we know from the start that its technological protagonist—the ballpoint pen—will triumph, we find ourselves repeatedly surprised by the story's unfolding episodes of international intrigue, financial deception, and legal shenanigans.\\" —Henry Petroski, author of The Pencil and The Essential Engineer \\"The tale of László Bíró and Andor Goy and their development of the ballpoint pen is a wonderful illustration of the role that human passions, foibles, and genius play in shaping the world around us.\\" —Robert Friedel, author of Zipper: an Exploration in Novelty  Political controversy  In 1988, in his book Bűn az élet (Life is Crime), Moldova addressed a sensitive subject that, with widely varying interpretations, is on the minds of many Hungarians: the relatively high crime rate among the country's Roma (Gypsy) minority. While the book focuses on the real lives of cops on the beat, its frank portrayal of what in the communist era had been openly termed in government-political circles and by law enforcement authorities as cigánybűnözés (gypsy crime) stirred considerable debate; the term has since fallen out of favor among most political parties in Hungary due to its perceived racist overtones. Although he himself is a self-professed \\"independent leftist\\" who has never belonged to a political party, Moldova is openly supportive of communist ideals and is known for his loyalty to the late János Kádár, Hungarian communist leader and General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, who ruled the country from 1956 until his forced retirement in 1988. Most famously, Moldova published a biography, Kádár, in which he termed this longest-ruling of all twentieth-century Hungarian political figures a \\"genius\\" and suggested that the executions of political prisoners after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution had been justified.

At the age of 13 he began playing football for Helsingør IF (now Elite 3000 Fodbold). By 1928, however, he had switched to track and field athletics and began running for the club in cross- country tournaments. During the early 1930s he was both a cross-country and middle distance runner for the club, but he later focused exclusively on long distances, after coming in third in the 5,000m event at the Danish National Championships in 1935.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Ben Hardaway. The short was released on March 9, 1935, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary The film opens to a lawless town in the Old West; at a saloon, Buddy plays the piano. The bar is tended by a pig, and a dog patron quickly becomes incapacitated by liquor. Cookie the serving girl sings \\"Oklahoma Joe\\". In a gunfight, one patron's head is obliterated, only to the revelation that it is a large mask worn by Buddy, who is taking part in the musical number. A lantern then falls on his head. A dog man enters, and posts, on the wall, an announcement: \\"Notice! Pony Express Race from Red Gulch to Skull Crick & back -- Mail Contract awarded to winner - Race Starts 2:30 to-day!\\" All run off to prepare. Buddy, calling the race a cinch, runs off with Cookie to show her his horse, which he claim is \\"the fastest in the county!\\" Seeing that the time is nigh, Buddy goes off to ready himself. The cartoon's villain, another dog-like character, takes Buddy's trusty steed to a glue factory, exchanging it for an anemic old horse, which the villain inflates by way of a balloon, and places where Our Hero would expect to find his own animal. The scene shifts to the site of the race now. Buddy rushes off with the sickly horse to the starting line. The competition begins: a dog with crutches is outraced by a competitor with a dog as his vehicle. But said dog proceeds to chase a rabbit through a series of holes, tangling itself and its master up in the process. Somehow, the villain and Buddy are neck and neck in the race. The dastardly fiend pulls Buddy's horse by its tail and swings the creature around in the air; the villain laughs at the grounded Buddy, but is taken down by a cactus, his horse moving on without him. The race continues on a road going up a cliff, with Buddy ahead; Buddy is lifted, his straps intact, from the saddle, then caught by a tree and tangled up. With some trouble, he returns to the race, only to encounter a rickety bridge, easily conquered first by the villain, who then shakes it as Buddy rides upon it. The bridge rolls up into a wheel with Buddy, sitting a-gee, inside. The wheel crashes into a rock by the precipice of a cliff and breaks; the horse is down, and Buddy, flung over the edge, hangs on a small tree branch on the cliffside. The villain laughs, and, in an effort to send Buddy to his watery doom, tosses a large rock at the branch, which bounces the boulder back up, hitting the scoundrel in the face; the villain falls from the perch of the cliff, taking the grass and the horses with him. The flimsy branch breaks under all of the new weight, and so Our Hero, his adversary, and the horses fall into the water. Buddy now sits, above the water, on an upside-down horse, the villain on a right-side-up horse, but underwater. As the two struggle to reach land, the villain cuts the previously hidden balloon tail hanging from Buddy's horse's mouth, allowing the horse to deflate. The villain moves on, back to the racetrack, whilst Buddy is left to push his horse out of the lake. The tired creature can not seem to be motivated, until, as part of an oncoming rain shower, a bolt of lightning suddenly strikes the horse's behind! And lightning continues to strike Our Hero's steed as they near the finish line. Buddy and his enemy are again neck and neck, and just before the end of the race can be reached by either, both fall into mud puddles. With Cookie cheering him on, Buddy wins the race, for another bolt of lightning sends his horse galloping, underground, to the other side of the finish line. Buddy is awarded the mail contract, and Buddy and Cookie give the much-abused horse a kiss. Dating discrepancy This article's dating follows the information given in Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1929-1939), which, in this case, agrees on the release date, though not the release order, of the cartoon in question, with the appendix of Leonard Maltin's Of Mice and Magic. After Buddy's Pony Express, and Maltin's book agree on the release order, though not necessarily the release dates, of Buddy's cartoons.

His father, a banker, later moved the family to Arab, Alabama, where Nall finished high school. Nall then attended the University of Alabama, earning a B.A. degree with a major in Art and minors in Psychology and Political Science. Nall was admitted to study at the École des Beaux-Arts (School of Fine Arts) of Paris, France in 1971.

Nall took care of James Baldwin on his deathbed. Nall had been friends with Baldwin from the early 1970s because Baldwin would buy him drinks at the Café de Flore. Nall recalled talking to Baldwin about racism in Alabama with the racially conscious author. In one conversation, Nall told Baldwin that \\"Through your books you liberated me from my guilt about being so bigoted coming from Alabama and because of my homosexuality.\\" Baldwin insisted that \\"No, you liberated me in revealing this to me.\\" Nall is close friends with Albert II, Prince of Monaco and Catherine Deneuve who both own multiple works created by him. He is also friends with Ringo Starr. NALL Art Association In 1986, Nall bought a studio in Vence, France, and began publishing his line engravings. This led to his acquiring the existing Karolyi Foundation and from this creating the N.A.L.L. (Nature Art & Life League) Art Association. Located on a three-hectare (seven and one-half-acre) estate in a valley between Vence and [Saint-Paul-de-Vence], Nall spent 3 years personally rebuilding and renovating the entire existing houses and adding a Museum to house and exhibit his artwork.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. The parish church is now St Oswald's Church, Bollington. History The church was built between 1832 and 1834, and was designed by William Hayley and Thomas Brown. A grant of £3,475 (equivalent to £ in ) was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission. The total building cost was £4,002 (equivalent to £ in ). Galleries were added in 1854. The church was declared redundant on 1 February 2006. Architecture St John's is constructed in hammer-dressed sandstone with ashlar dressings and Welsh slate roofs. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, a short chancel with a vestry at the east, and a west tower. The chancel is described as \\"a mere alcove without an arch\\". The tower is in four stages with angle buttresses and a west door. Above the door is a three-light window. The third stage contains clock faces, and in the top stage are two-light louvred bell openings. The parapet is embattled. The bays of the nave are divided by buttresses, each bay containing a two-light window with Y-tracery. The east window of the chancel has three lights. An embattled parapet runs along the top of the nave. At the corners of the nave and the chancel are octagonal buttresses rising to pointed finials. Inside the church there are galleries on three sides that are supported by thin iron columns. The two-manual organ was made in 1836 by Samuel Renn. It was enlarged in 1909 by Nicholson and Lord. Since then, Jardine rebuilt the organ in about 1932, and renovated it in 1980. The organ has been restored and is now installed at St George's church, Nailsworth (more details can be found on St George's parish website). The peal of eight bells from St John's were renovated and are now installed at St Thomas's church, Stockton Heath. Two new bells were added and the new peal rang for the first time at St Thomas's on 8 January 2017 at a Dedication service conducted by the Bishop of Chester (a brief news item can be found on Bollington parish blog). External features The churchyard contains the war graves of 15 Commonwealth service personnel, 13 from World War I, and two from World War II, most of which are in an extension of the churchyard.

Developed in the late 1940s it was the first in the line of production Martin-Baker seats for military aircraft. Ground and air testing of earlier designs resulted in the first successful test ejection of a company employee in July 1946. A seat type designed for the Saunders-Roe company was known as the Pre-Mk.1. History The death of Valentine Baker in an aircraft accident in 1942 prompted James Martin to investigate new methods for aircrew escape and survival. Martin had previous experience of aircraft survival systems and had designed a quick-release canopy system during the Battle of Britain, a very successful device that was later fitted as standard to all Spitfires during manufacture.Philpott 1989, p. 21. In 1944 Martin was approached by the Air Staff after a fatal accident with the jet-powered Gloster F.9/40 (Gloster Meteor prototype).Philpott 1989 p. 21. They asked for an escape system that forcibly ejected the pilot from an aircraft and was powerful enough to clear the tail surfaces at high airspeeds. German and Swedish engineers were investigating the same problem, but Martin was unaware of this.Philpott 1989, p. 23. Martin initially investigated systems that could be retro-fitted to existing fighter aircraft types that were in service at the time. His first design, a spring-powered swinging arm, hinged near the base of the fin, was not pursued although a Boulton Paul Defiant aircraft had been loaned to the Martin-Baker company for modification and testing. A method using explosive charges to clear the seat from an aircraft was investigated next, as no information was available on what effect the g-forces might have on the human body a test rig was constructed at Denham for readings to be taken. On 20 January 1945 a dummy was test fired on the rig, four days later a company fitter, Bernard Lynch volunteered to test the system and was fired to a height of just under with no ill effects felt. The size of the explosive charge was progressively increased until Lynch reached a height of 10 ft and declared that he was experiencing pain. News of the test quickly reached the aviation press, a journalist from The Aeroplane was hospitalised with crushed vertebrae after trying out the rig for himself.Philpott 1989, p. 24. James Martin was very concerned by this development and worked hard to reduce the peak acceleration loads felt by the occupant, the solution was to use a second charge firing in sequence and alterations to the seat to provide a posture that would protect the spine. Foot rests and a face blind firing handle were added.Philpott 1989, p. 25. Almost 200 tests were completed on the 16 ft rig when testing transferred to a new rig, Bernard Lynch again being the first to use it on 17 August 1945, reaching a height of just over . The need for airborne testing was apparent, the Defiant loaned for testing had its rear turret removed and a loaded seat had been fired from it whilst stationary on the ground on 10 May 1945. The next day the test was repeated in the air, a further five tests up to indicated airspeeds of were successful.Philpott 1989, p. 29. On 12 September 1945 the Martin-Baker company was awarded a contract to design and produce two seats for high-speed testing, a Gloster Meteor aircraft was modified for testing. The first airborne test with this aircraft took place over Chalgrove airfield in June 1946. Using a dummy the parachute failed when it opened prematurely at a speed of . A time-delay release mechanism was developed and initially suffered from problems. After many more tests it was felt that the system was safe enough for a manned live test. The volunteer was again Bernard Lynch, firing himself from the rear cockpit of the Meteor at over Chalgrove on 24 July 1946, the system worked perfectly.Philpott 1989, p. 31. Many more tests followed at ever increasing altitudes and airspeeds, some live and some with dummies. By 1948 the design had been refined enough to enter production for use in Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm aircraft. Prior to this order the Saunders-Roe company requested a seat to be used in its SR.A/1 jet-powered flying boat. This seat was known as the 'Pre-Mk.1' and did not feature all the refinements built into the production Mk.1 seats.Philpott 1989, p. 39. The first prototype Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52, TS363, crashed on 30 May 1949, the pilot, J.O. Lancaster, used the pre-Mk.1 ejection seat to save his life, making it the first occasion of an emergency ejection by a British pilot.Philpott 1989, p. 125. Operation sequence Operating the face blind firing handle initiated firing of the main gun located at the rear of the seat, the main gun being a telescopic tube with two explosive charges that fired in sequence. As the seat moved up its guide rails an emergency oxygen supply was activated.Martin-Baker Mk.1 fact sheets www.martin-baker.com Retrieved: 16 December 2011 Martin-Baker Mk.1C ejection seat on display at the Royal Air Force Museum London As the seat moved further up and out of the aircraft a lanyard attached to the cockpit floor fired a steel rod, known as the drogue gun, this extracted two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. The occupant then released themselves from the seat harness and operated the main parachute manually by pulling a ripcord. Applications At some stage in their development examples of these aircraft were fitted with Martin-Baker Mk.1 ejection seats. ;Test aircraft: *Boulton Paul Defiant *Gloster Meteor ;Pre Mk.1 *Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 *Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 ;Mk.1 List from Martin-Baker. *English Electric Canberra *FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II *Gloster Meteor *Hawker Hunter *Hawker Sea Hawk *Supermarine Attacker *Westland Wyvern *Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck *Supermarine Swift Seats on display *A Martin-Baker Pre-Mk.1 is on static display at the Solent Sky museum in Southampton. *A Martin-Baker Mk.1C is on display at the Royal Air Force Museum London.Royal Air Force Museum London - Martin-Baker Mk.1C navigator.rafmuseum.org Retrieved: 16 December 2011 Specifications (Mk.1) *Maximum operating height: Not known *Minimum operating height: Not known *Minimum operating speed: Not known *Maximum operating speed: 400+ knots indicated airspeed References Notes Bibliography *Philpott, Bryan.

Shortly afterwards he transferred to the University of Graz, where he was influenced by neurologist Gabriel Anton (1858-1933), gynecologist Alfons von Rosthorn (1857-1909), histologist Alexander Rollett (1834-1903), internist Friedrich Kraus (1858-1936) and pediatrician Theodor Escherich (1857-1911), who was also his brother-in-law. After receiving his doctorate he became an assistant to Franz Hofmeister (1850-1922 at Strassburg. He was habilitated for pediatrics in 1900 at Graz, becoming an associate professor and director of its children’s clinic two years later. In 1906 he was appointed director of the university children's hospital in Munich. He would remain in Munich for the remainder of his career. Pfaundler made contributions in all facets of pediatric medicine. He was particularly interested in the diathetic (hereditary and/or biological predisposition to a disorder) aspects of disease.

After a long career as a ballet dancer and company director, he is now widely considered to be one of the foremost European choreographers of his time.Horst Koegler and others, Heinz Spoerli: Weltbürger des Balletts (Zurich: Verlag Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 2011).Richard Merz, \\"Spoerli, Heinz,\\" International Encyclopedia of Dance (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 5, pp. 681–4.  Early life and training  Born in Basel into a prosperous family, Heinz Spörli was exposed to theater arts at an early age, thanks to the enthusiasm of his father.Koegler and others, Heinz Spoerli (2011), p. 178. This work, in German and English, is the principal source of biographical information given herein. As a schoolboy, he appeared as an extra in a number of local productions and sometimes took small acting or dancing roles. At age 17, he began taking ballet classes with Walter Kleiber, a well- known local teacher, while continuing his formal education.Merz, \\"Spoerli, Heinz\\" (1998), p. 681. Upon graduation from school, he completed his compulsory military service in the Swiss Army before resuming his dance training. Realizing his natural talent for ballet and hoping to make it his career, he devoted himself to his ballet classes and to his studies in dance, music, and art history. During this time, he changed the spelling of his surname from Spörli to Spoerli.  Career  Despite his late start, Spoerli advanced rapidly in his dance training, and in 1960, at age 19, he was engaged as an artist of the Basel Municipal Theater, directed by Vaslav Orlikovsky.Koegler and others, Heinz Spoerli (2011), includes all details of his professional career.Merz, \\"Spoerli, Heinz,\\" (1998), pp. 681–4, gives major details of his professional career. He continued to improve his classical technique while appearing in operas, operettas, and the spectacular ballet productions that Orlikovsky mounted. In 1963 Spoerli joined the Cologne State Opera Ballet, directed by Todd Bolender. There he was exposed to an international repertory of high caliber, including works of Balanchine, Béjart, Cranko, de Mille, and Lander. In 1966 he moved to Canada, having been hired as a soloist by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, directed by Arnold Spohr. The following year, 1967, he made his first choreographies, two short pas de deux for the Calgary Ballet Company. After a brief stint back in Cologne, he returned to Canada in late 1967 as a soloist with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal. There, under the direction of Ludmilla Chiriaeff and Fernand Nault, he danced in both classical and modern works by Dolin, Lichine, Nault, Paige, Kuch, and Butler. In 1969 Spoerli returned to Switzerland, where he danced as a soloist with the Basel Ballet, directed by Pavel Smok, and then with the Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève, directed by Alfonso Catá. In Geneva from 1970 to 1973 he again danced in works by Balanchine and other prominent neoclassical choreographers. There, in 1972, he also made his first major ballet, Le Chemin (\\"The Road\\"), set to an electronic score that had been commissioned from Éric Gaudibert. The success of Le Chemin led to Spoerli's appointment as resident choreographer of the Basel Ballet in 1973 and as ballet director of the Basel Municipal Theater in 1978. Working in his hometown for almost two decades, he elevated the artistic and technical standards of the company dancers to a remarkable degree and created many works for ballet stages, for opera and operetta, and for television productions. During his tenure the Basel Ballet was recognized as one of the foremost ballet companies in all of Europe.Heinz Spoerlis Basler Ballett (Basel: Buchverlag Basler Zeitung, 1991). In the autumn of 1991 Spoerli left Basel to become the director of the Rhine Opera Ballet, the resident company for Düsseldorf and Duisberg, Germany. The large roster of dancers in this company allowed him to mount productions on a grander scale than had been possible in Basel, and he took full advantage of the opportunity, creating some of his most memorable works during his sojourn in Germany. In 1996 he returned to Switzerland to assume the post of artistic director and choreographer of the Zurich Ballet. There he assembled one of the finest ensembles of dancers in Europe and continued to present his audiences with bold new productions.10 Jahr Heinz Spoerlis Zürcher Ballett (Zurich: Opernhaus Zürich, 2007). Two promotional DVDs with this same title were issued by Syrinx in 2003 and 2005. Over the years, Spoerli also worked as guest choreographer for dance companies in many cities of Europe and Asia, including Paris, Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Milan, Budapest, Vienna, Graz, Lisbon, Stockholm, Oslo, Helsinki, Hong Kong, and Singapore. His acclaimed version of La Fille Mal Gardée was, in fact, created for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1981, and his dances for Rossini's opera William Tell, the story of the Swiss folk hero, were created for the ballet of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan in 1995. Performed by his own companies, his ballets have also been seen in the United States, England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, Egypt, Israel, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Japan, China, Taiwan, and Thailand. Upon completion of his contract, Spoerli retired from his post with the Zurich Ballet in June 2012.\\"Ballet Director Heinz Spoerli to stand down,\\" press release, Zurich Opera House, 5 February 2010: http://www.artlink.co.za/news. Under the direction of his successor, the company is committed to cultivate his choreographic legacy and to preserve his works, which remain an essential part of the company's repertoire. As an independent artist, Spoerli continues to be much in demand as a guest choreographer for ballet companies around the world.  Choreography  Spoerli prefers to identify himself as \\"dance maker\\" rather than \\"choreographer,\\" as he believes that that term better describes the variety of theatrical dance styles and forms in which he works.Spoerli \\"Ich bin Tanzmacher\\": Der Choreograf Heinz Spoerli (2010), a film of Werner Zeindler on DVD (Fama Film). Whether small and intimate or large-scale and spectacular, his dance works do indeed demonstrate a wide range of choreographic styles, from classical, neoclassical, and contemporary ballet to modern and postmodern dance to provocative, avant-garde theater pieces. Throughout his career Spoerli often returned to classical ballets and traditional works whose dramatic or musical structure particularly interested him.Philipp Flury and Peter Kaufmann, Heinz Spoerli: Ballett-Fascination (1983), expanded ed. (Zurich: Fetz, 1996), pp. 40–173, gives a chronology of all choreographic works from 1967 to 1982.Koegler and others, Heinz Spoerli (2011), includes discussion of all major works and gives a complete chronology of all choreographic works from 1967 to 2012. His innovative production of Giselle, oder der Wilis, first presented in Basel in 1976, was later mounted in Zurich (1980), in Duisberg (1993), and again in Zurich (1998). His versions of The Firebird, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Coppélia, Romeo and Juliet, The Nutcracker, and Les Noces were all presented in more than one production, as was his Swan Lake, which was presented in its third, final revision in Zurich in 2005. For his third version of A Midsummer Night's Dream (1994), Spoerli supplemented the familiar music of Mendelssohn-Bartholdy with contemporary compositions by Philip Glass and Steve Reich, and for the fourth version, in 1996, he enhanced the confusion of identities and the senses at the heart of the plot by adding actors from the Royal Shakespeare Company as stagehands who interrupt the action, leaving audiences to wonder just what kind of innovative dance-theater piece they had witnessed.Merz, \\"Spoerli, Heinz\\" (1998), p. 683. The production was revived in Zurich in 2010. Besides evening-length classical ballets, numerous contemporary ballets with a story line or evocative meaning, such as Verklärte Nacht (\\"Radiant Night\\"), and lighthearted works such as Chäs (\\"Cheese\\"), Spoerli produced a number of neoclassical, abstract works. Among them are Goldberg Variations, In den Winden im Nichts (\\"Winds in the Void\\"), and Wäre heute morgen und gestern jetzt (\\"if today were tomorrow and yesterday now\\"), all set to music by Bach. Other neoclassical works include allem nah, allem fern (\\"close to everything, far from everything\\"), set to Mahler's Fifth Symphony; moZART (the title is a play on the composer's name and the German word for \\"tender\\"); and In Spillville, set to Dvořák's string quartet no. 12, the \\"American Quartet.\\" One of his most admired creations, made for the Rhine Opera Ballet, was inspired by the life and work of the Florentine Mannerist painter Pontormo (1494–1557). Entitled . . . und Farben, die mitten in die Brust leuchten (\\". . . and colors that shine in the heart\\"), it was set to music by a wide spectrum of composers, from John Dowland (1563–1626) to Julia Wolfe (born 1958), and it included an equally wide spectrum of dance styles, ranging from Pontormo's time to the present. Among Spoerli's many works created expressly for television are Träume (\\"Dreams\\"/\\"Reveries,\\" 1979), set to music of Wagner, and König David (\\"King David,\\" 1981), set to music of Honegger. Both productions starred Birgit Keil and Rudy Bryans. Flury and Kaufmann, Heinz Spoerli: Ballett-Faszination (1996), pp. 97–9, 117. The 1996 and 1998 New Year's Concerts of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra included dances made by Spoerli for members of the Vienna State Opera Ballet, including waltzes to Johann Strauss's famous An der schönen blauen Donau (\\"On the Beautiful Blue Danube\\").

Periodically, the foundation makes substantial cash awards to outstanding choreographers and dancers and contributes to educational programs designed to foster public interest in dance. In 2013, Spoerli donated his personal papers and theatrical memorabilia to the Paul Sacher Foundation, an archive and research center for the music of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Located in Münsterplatz, in the heart of Basel, the foundation's library contains holdings of materials from many Swiss composers and musicians as well as figures such as Stravinsky, Bartók, Berio, Boulez, Carter, and others of international renown.

The brave fisherman went into the sea to bring back his six dead brothers, who had been swallowed one after one by the devouring whale. Synopsis In the good old days, there was a village of fishermen called Kalachi. The villagers' main source of subsistence was fishing; they used to row their boats deep into the sea to catch fish. In the locality (now known as Clifton) was a hazardous whirlpool called 'Kalachi jo Kun', meaning the 'Vortex of Kalachi'. Boats would get caught and sink deep into the vortex. Once, a whale took abode in the whirlpool and it devoured the crew of the boats, caught in the whirlpool. There was another village of fishermen known as Sonmiani 60 miles away from Kalachi. There lived in the village a fisherman named Aoubhayo (). He had seven sons, all strong and well-built, except for his youngest son Moriro, who was of short stature and handicapped; as such he was not taken fishing. His six brothers used to go for their catch early in the morning and return after sunset. One day they did not return home. It worried the villagers. They went out to search and discovered that their boats were caught by the whirlpool and the Whale had devoured them. Learning about the tragic death of his brothers, Moriro, though handicapped, resolved to take revenge and rid the villagers of the calamitous monster. He got an iron-cage made, fitted with pointed spikes on its outside and tied with strong ropes. The ropes were fastened to the necks of two strong male buffaloes. He sat inside the cage and it was lowered in the whirlpool. He instructed the villagers to pull out the cage when he shook ropes inside. As the cage was lowered, the fish, seeing prey, pounced on it to swallow it. It got hooked and pierced with spikes. Moriro shook the ropes and the cage was pulled out along with the monster shark enmeshed with the cage. Villagers incised its stomach and brought out remains of the all the dead brothers and buried them near the northeast side of Kalachi, at the foot of the mountain, and Moriro spent rest of his life as keeper of their graves. The place even today is called the \\"Graveyard of Moriro\\". It is two miles from Karachi, near the cremation ground of Hindus. Legacy of Moriro The great mystic poet of Sindh Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai has used the tale to elucidate his religiosity and spirituality by combining his visionary gleams to the tale. The Poet does not narrate the tale, but appropriates certain situations, events, and some distinct features of the tale having rich implication. They stand for more than what they are on the surface and hint at a larger meaning. It is a dramatization of forces of good and evil in the human soul. The symbolization of the inner struggle of man with a beast in him, who spiritually devours him and a whirlpool, where soul sinks on his spiritual voyage. With suggestion the poet evokes ideas, feelings, over and above the actual sense and sound of the word. Sea could be interpreted as a symbol of infinity, the other world as well as this world, the mystery of life and death, the enigma beyond comprehension, and whale as man's base self.

Early life Mahendra Gaur born on 26 January 1956 at Nasirabad (Ajmer) spent his early years in Jodhpur, Jaipur, Udaipur for education. In 1967 he was selected for National Merit Scholarship and sponsored to Vidya Bhawan Public School, Udaipur for schooling. In 1971 he enrolled for engineering in Malaviya Regional Engineering College (now Malaviya National Institute of Technology) and graduated in 1976 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Career Mahendra Gaur joined Indian Oil Corporation Limited in February 1977. He underwent one year training on \\"Utilization of Fuels and Lubricants in I. C. Engines and Industrial Machinery at Indian Institution of Petroleum, Dehradun as sponsored candidate from Indian Oil. He worked as Lubricant Technologist at Mumbai, Bhopal, Rajkot, Ahemdabad offices of Indian Oil. In 1989, he was sponsored by Indian Oil and Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India to National Management Program conducted by Management Development Institute, Gurgaon. The National Management Program was brainchild of Rajiv Gandhi and coordinated by P. Chidambaram. The National Management Program was supported by the three Indian Institute of Management, Ahemdabad, Banguluru, and Kolkata and XLRI Jamshedpur. On successful completion of NMP, he was awarded PGDM at a convocation ceremony attended by Manmohan Singh as chief guest. Malpractices in Sale of 2T Oil In 1993, while working for Indian Oil at Jaipur he discovered that two-wheeler owners were cheated by petrol pump dealers in the name of \\"single oil\\" and \\"double oil\\". The recommended dosage of 2T Oil in two-wheeler is 20ml/liter of Petrol, but the petrol pump dealers used to charge for 30 ml in the name of single oil but actually deliver 20 ml to the vehicle owners. Likewise in the name of \\"double oil\\" the consumer was given 40 ml, but charged for 60 ml. Mahendra Gaur fought a prolonged battle within Indian Oil, with the State Government of Rajasthan, Government of India to get relief to the two- and three-wheeler consumers. Fake PUC Certificates He also forced the Government Departments particularly Transport Department to deal firmly with the Petrol Pump Dealers who were issuing Fake PUC Certificates. In 2001 on his complaint the State Government initiated an inquiry which revealed that 80,000 Fake Pollution Under Control Certificates were issued. The transport commissioner cancelled licences of 5-dealers and Indian Oil fined Rs. 5000.00 each on the dealers and suspended licence for 15 days. Right to Information The Government of India introduced the Right to Information Act, 2005. Mahendra Gaur was among the first applicants who seriously went into pursuit of information under the Act. There was general reluctance among the Government Officers to give File Noting. He vociferously argued in favour of disclosure of file noting. He was one of the first applicants to get file noting from Cabinet Secretariat. In June 2006 he succeeded in compelling the Central Information Commission to issue directives to Department of Personnel to remove offensive information about file noting from its web site. Mahendra Gaur was the first person to get file noting from Government Department in Rajasthan. Mahendra Gaur has been in the forefront in getting the Right to Information Act, 2005 implemented in Delhi High Court, Rajasthan High Court and Bar Council of Rajasthan and the office of President of India Legal Practice In 2009, Bar Council of Rajasthan enrolled Mahendra Gaur as Advocate. He combines rare combination of Engineering and Management into Legal Profession. In 2009 when no one after Jaipur Indian Fire was ready to take up cudgels with the Government, he lodged FIR against Indian Oil and the Police Officers responsible for delay in investigating the criminal angle against Jaipur Fire. Mahendra Gaur represented widows of Indian Oil Fire in their quest for just and fair compensation and justice for their slain husbands. He is presently on a mission to introduce judicial reforms in Rajasthan High Court. Rajasthan High Court Rajasthan High Court had a poor record of implementing Right to Information Act and using Internet. Through a sustained campaign Mahendra Gaur introduced fundamental changes in the working of Rajasthan High Court. Mahendra Gaur compelled Rajasthan High Court to frame Rules and upload it on Internet. In the matter of 2009 Jaipur fire Mahendra Gaur has been appointed counsel by the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority to represent the widows of Indian Oil Officers and other victims who lost their husband in the Fire Tragedy.

The LP comprises modified samples of pre-World War II shellac ballroom jazz records Kirby bought cheaply at a Brooklyn store in December 2010. The record's editing of the audio sources is based on a study regarding people with Alzheimer's disease being able to remember music they listened to when they were younger, as well as where they were and how they felt when they listened to it. An Empty Bliss Beyond This World was the Caretaker's breakthrough album, garnering critical acclaim upon its release and making its way into numerous year-end lists by publications. Pitchfork has called it the 75th best album of the first half of the 2010s as well as the 14th best ambient album of all time. Concept An Empty Bliss Beyond This World follows the mind of a person who tries and struggles to remember even small parts of their life using broken sounds. The record was based on a 2010 study about the ability of people with Alzheimer's disease to remember music they listened to when they were younger, as well as where they were and how they felt when they listened to it. The Caretaker project was inspired by the use of ballroom music in films such as Carnival of Souls (1962), The Shining (1980), and the television series Pennies from Heaven (1978), which drew James Kirby to themes of memory loss that appear on An Empty Bliss Beyond This World: \\"Famously, people as they got older have started seeing dead people, people from the past, and that's their reality because the brain's misfiring. I'm very interested in these kinds of stories. Music's probably the last thing to go for a lot of people with advanced Alzheimer's. There are a lot of people who suffer from Alzheimer's who just hum the same songs over and over again.\\" Critic Rowan Savage compared the album to Mark Z. Danielewski's novel House of Leaves (2000) due to its \\"endless and fearfully cavernous space (the ballroom) existing concealed by the deceptive limitations of familiar domesticity\\" represented with a deep resonant sound. Some tracks on An Empty Bliss Beyond This World have another slightly-different version of it that appears later in the album and have the same name, such as the title track and \\"Mental Caverns Without Sunshine.\\"Pierini, Michele (20 June 2011). \\"The Caretaker An – Empty Bliss Beyond This World album review\\". MVRemix. Retrieved 25 July 2017. Kirby explained this was done to give it a déjà vu vibe: \\"Immediately upon first listen, you’re already questioning where you have heard this song before.\\" The second version of \\"Mental Caverns Without Sunshine\\" is only half as long as the first version of the track on the LP. As Savage analyzed, the repeating of samples and loops on the LP questions the listener if \\"[their] sense of familiarity spring[s] from the loop[s] [themselves] or from the very patina that inheres in the scratchy turntable record as such,\\" as well as \\"if samples are being looped or whether the pieces chosen, in their role as background to an always already arriving vocal line or dance step, are repetitive in and of themselves.\\" While most of the tracks on the album suddenly end, the album's closer fades out which, according to Savage, is a \\"memento mori that must go hand-in-hand with the resurrection of sounds as temporally distant as these, with the re-giving of the name and hence finitude, the entry (or, rather, re- entry) into mercilessly linear history.\\" An Empty Bliss Beyond This World has retrofuturistic themes of disputes between the distant past and the envisioned future similar to Into Outer Space with Lucia Pamela (1969).

The samples in An Empty Bliss Beyond This World's first tracks are the most prominent. Surrounding these samples are vinyl scratches and click and pop sounds that, in the words of Savage, are \\"steampunk glitches.\\" All of the sounds become more filtered in echo as each track goes on. It is unknown if Kirby added these echo filters or if they are a part of the original recordings, which Savage interpreted as giving the LP an \\"affective\\" vibe. As the album progresses, the samples become more fragmented and unnoticeable, the sounds stop staying at both stereo channels, and the tracks become shorter. Thus, as Savage wrote, \\"the experience begins to fall apart.\\" This is all until \\"Camaraderie at Arms Length,\\" which starts a clear repeat of the music sources heard in the LP's early tracks that ends the album. An Empty Bliss Beyond This World is one of very few albums where the main focus is not on composition and instrumentation. The primary attention of the album is how the audio sources are altered and edited. As Powell wrote, An Empty Bliss Beyond This World has a \\"mindless\\" method of editing audio sources to represent \\"the fragmented and inconclusive ways our memories work.\\" The tracks on the LP \\"never feel filled- in from start to finish, and they tend to linger on moments that feel especially comforting or conclusive.\\" Some songs end abruptly in what feels like their mid-way point, and the album also has a \\"jump cut\\" method of transitioning between each track and noticeable skipping through melodic samples. The LP develops from its small changes in reverb and echo and how the amount of noise that surrounds the samples increases. The echo was noted by some critics to give the album a ghost-like ominous feel, while Powell wrote that the crooked editing of the samples is what gave the album its eerie feel: \\"The source material is music designed not only to comfort, but to sound like it existed before you: hymns, love songs, lullabies. Bliss is eerie because it takes the seduction of those forms and turns it slightly askew.\\" Bussolini analyzed that the audio sources used have a timeless feel to them which is also what gives the LP its ghostly vibe: \\"The music allows for just enough change to hold our interest, but after the party's over...well, the party's never over and it's never quite present. [...] the album ends, but whatever it conjured can't.\\" While Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor described the tone of An Empty Bliss Beyond This World as \\"overbearingly depressive,\\" other reviewers noted brighter vibes with the LP. Savage wrote that An Empty Bliss Beyond This World was different from the \\"dissonant and reverberated\\" past releases of the Caretaker in that it had a tone that was \\"subtle and disconcertingly reassuring — as if the shades of the Overlook Hotel, in imploring the caretaker to join them, were to ask that he should do so through the medium of suicide rather than murder.\\" This was similarly noted in Powell's review of the LP, which he wrote that \\"there's something at least metaphorically beautiful-- even slightly funny-- about living inside a locked groove, dancing with nobody.\\" D. M. Edwards, a critic for PopMatters, opined that while some tracks, such as \\"All You're Going to Want to Do Is Get Back There\\" and \\"Mental Caverns Without Sunshine,\\" are \\"sublime rather than weird or unnerving,\\" others are \\"uncomfortable as being ten years old and required to kiss your grandmother on her overly lipsticked mouth.\\" In addition to its bright feel, An Empty Bliss Beyond This World also differs from past Caretaker works in that, whereas the audio sources were previously obscured via lots of pitch-shifting and reverb, here there is a much clearer focus on the samples.Knapman, James (15 July 2011). \\"The Caretaker :: An Empty Bliss This World (History Always Favours The Winners)\\".

Nail, also known as Jack Nail, (August 22, 1883March 6, 1947) was an African-American real estate agent in New York City, significant for developing Harlem. His sister was Grace Nail Johnson, wife of James Weldon Johnson, both civil rights activists. Nail got his start in the real estate business working for Philip A. Payton, Jr.'s Afro-American Realty Company, another real estate firm catering to African-American customers in New York City. In 1905, he founded the Nail-Parker Company with Henry G. Parker. In 1911, Nail, together with his pastor, Rev. Hutchens C. Bishop of St. Philip's Episcopal Church, bought over a million dollars' worth of real estate in the Harlem area of New York City. Starting in the late nineteenth century, African Americans began moving from the southern United States into the New York City area. Nail realized that most of these new arrivals were not financially able to purchase homes, and began converting or constructing apartments on his land purchases. By 1925, Nail's business owned around fifty apartment buildings in the Harlem area. Nail became the most important Black real estate agent in New York City, and sat on the Real Estate Board of New York and the Housing Committee of New York; in each case he was the only African-American member. After the Great Depression struck, Nail's business went bankrupt in 1933. Nail attempted to restart successor businesses but was unable to get them off the ground. Nail died in 1947. His work left Harlem a community of renters rather than owners, and led ultimately to the area being populated by working-class tenements.

A notable issue is volume 2, a copy of which was sold in December 2011 for £690,850 at Sotheby's in London. Writing the magazine on the basis of established literary models helped Charlotte and Branwell in their maturation process toward becoming \\"literary professionals\\".Bock 52. History The Brontë siblings began writing prose and poetry related to their paracosmic fantasy world in the 1820s, and in December 1827 produced a novel, Glass Town. In January 1829 Branwell started publishing a monthly miscellany involving events and characters from that world, Branwell's Blackwood's Magazine, the title taken from the well-known magazine Blackwood's Magazine, and its content inspired by Blackwood's and Fraser's Magazine. Branwell published it for six months.Barnard, \\"Branwell's Blackwood's Magazine.\\" Its name changed to Blackwood's Young Men's Magazine when Charlotte took it over in 1829; six volumes were published over the next six months. She resurrected it in August 1830 as The Young Men's Magazine. The Young Men were characters based on the original twelve wooden soldiers bought by Rev. Brontë for Branwell in 1826.Barnard, \\"Blackwood's Young Men's Magazine.\\" The books were supposed to have been produced and read by the soldiers, thus their miniature size. What the magazine borrowed especially from Blackwood's was its alternating between serious and satirical points of view, a dynamic Charlotte apparently found very attractive—she wrote, for instance, a series of contributions for two opposite frequent contributors to her magazine, \\"the sentimental Marquis of Douro and the sardonic Lord Charles Wellesley\\",Glen 9. sons of the Duke of Wellington, both of whom also figure in the plays she writes.Azim 114. Wellesley, Douro, and others wrote in correspondence columns; the magazine also featured advertisements; in one of those Lord Charles Wellesley challenges a man who insulted him in a tavern \\"to try a match at fisty- cuffs.\\"Bock 48. The prose fiction and drama is set in what has been called \\"Glass Town Saga\\", the fictional world set in West Africa, prompted by the gift of twelve little wooden soldiers to Branwell by his father. Stories related to these characters made their way into hundreds of little books, including, in 1829, the magazine. The authors' names were likewise fantastical or imaginative, often related to wood: Branwell signs as \\"Sergeant Bud,\\" and under Charlotte's editorship contributions are signed \\"WT\\" (\\"we two\\") or \\"UT\\" (\\"us two\\"). Charlotte as editor assumes the name \\"Captain Tree\\". Existing versions and facsimiles A partial facsimile of what is described as \\"the fifth Number of the Second Series\\" is in the Brontë Parsonage Museum.Catalogue 57. A set of nine issues was offered for sale by Bernard Quaritch; it contained six issues written by Charlotte (who signed her name as \\"the Genius C.B.\\") and three by Branwell.Quaritch 155. Description and contents of volume 2 The 14-year-old Charlotte Brontë produced six copies of The Young Men's Magazine, Volume 2. Four of them are in possession of the Brontë Parsonage Museum, and one was owned by a private collector; the location of the sixth is unknown. The copy presented for auction in 2011 was estimated to fetch between £200,000 and £300,000, but a bidding war ensued, won by the Paris Musée des Lettres et Manuscrits with a final bid of £690,850, more than any Brontë manuscript has ever fetched at auction. In November 2019, the Brönte Society was able to purchase the final fifth book in a Paris auction for €600,000 (£512,970.) The museum was able to purchase this book with the help of a robust fundraising campaign which was supported by such celebrities as Dame Judi Dench, president of the Brönte Society. The book has 19 hand- written pages, measuring , and containing over 4,000 words. It is set in \\"the earliest fictional world created by the Bronte siblings\\", Glass Town. The story is a precursor to an episode found much later, in Jane Eyre, \\"the famous passage ... in which Mr Rochester's insane wife, who is kept in the attic, seeks revenge by setting fire to his bed curtains\\".

If we understand governance as the creation of “conditions for ordered rule and collective action”Stoker, G. Governance as theory: five propositions. International Social Science Journal. Volume 50 1998, p. 17–28 (p. 17). then, given the fact that the reduction of carbon emissions will require concerted collective action, it follows that the governance of carbon will be of paramount concern. We have seen numerous international conferences over the past 20 years tasked with finding a way of facilitating this, and while international agreements have been infamously difficult to reach, action at the national level has been much more effective. In the UK, the Climate Change Act 2008 committed the government to meeting significant carbon reduction targets. In England, these carbon emissions are governed using numerous different instruments, which involve a variety of actors. While it has been argued by authors like Rhodes that there has been a “hollowing out” of the nation state, and that governments have lost their capabilities to govern to a variety of non-state actors and the European Union,Rhodes, R. A. W. The Hollowing out of the State: The Changing Nature of the Public Service in Britain. The Political Quarterly. Volume 65 1994, p. 138–151 (p. 139). the case of carbon governance in England actually runs counter to this. The government body responsible for the task, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), is the “main external dynamic”Davies, J. S. The Governance of Urban Regeneration: A critique of the 'Governing without Government' Thesis. Public Administration. Volume 80 2002, p. 301–322 (p. 309) behind governing actions in this area, and “rather than hollowing out (there has actually been a strengthening of) central co-ordination”.Bell, S. & Hindmoor, A. Rethinking governance: the centrality of the state in modern society. Cambridge University Press 2009, p. 87. The department may rely on other bodies to deliver its desired outcomes, but it is still ultimately responsible for the imposition of the rules and regulations that “steer (carbon) governmental action at the national level”.Heritier, A. & Lehmkuhl, D. Introduction: The Shadow of Hierarchy and New Modes of Governance. Journal of Public Policy. Volume 28 2008, p. 1–17 (p. 2). It is therefore evident that carbon governance in England is hierarchical in nature, in that “legislative decisions and executive decisions” are the main dynamic behind carbon governance action. This does not deny the existence of a network of bodies around DECC who are part of the process, but they are supplementary actors who are steered by central decisions. This article focuses on carbon governance in England as the other countries of the UK (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) all have devolved assemblies who are responsible for the governance of carbon emissions in their respective countries. Policy Instruments Climate Change Levy (CCL) A Climate Change Levy is a tax on carbon use in industry, commerce and the public sector introduced by the British government in 2001, with the overall aim of promoting carbon efficiency and stimulating investment in low carbon technology.DECC website. Climate Change Levy. Accessed 16/12/2011 While representing what is classed as a “market-based instrument”,Jordan, A., Wurzel, R. K. W. & Zito, A. R. Comparative Conclusions-'New' Environmental Policy Instruments: An Evolution or a Revolution in Environmental Policy?. Environmental Politics. Volume 12 2003, p. 201–224 (p. 203) in that it represents an economic incentive to manage carbon usage more effectively, the CCL is not what is understood as market governance. This is because CCL is not representative of the market steering actors in their carbon behaviour, but the government imposing a sanctionHeritier, A. & Lehmkuhl, D. Introduction: The Shadow of Hierarchy and New Modes of Governance. Journal of Public Policy. Volume 28 2008, pp. 1–17 (p. 13). to govern behaviour, which is constitutive of hierarchical governance. Climate Change Agreements (CCAs) Introduced at the same time as the CCL, Climate Change Agreements are “negotiated agreements between sector industry organisations and the government”Smith, S. & Swierzbinski, J. Assessing the performance of the UK ETS. Environmental Resource Economics. Volume 37 2007, pp. 131–158 (p. 134) whereby “energy- intensive industries can obtain a 65% discount from the CCL, provided they meet challenging targets for improving their energy efficiency or reducing carbon emissions”.DECC website. Climate Change Agreements. Accessed 16/12/2011.. This is an interesting example of governing carbon behaviour in a more indirect fashion. The DECC is still the authoritative body, but these voluntary agreements represent their attempt to create an atmosphere where it is seen as advantageous to business to manage carbon emissions.Okereke, C. An Exploration of Motivations, Drivers and Barriers to Carbon Management: The UK FTSE 100. European Management Journal. Volume 25, pp. 475–486. They have not done this through traditional regulatory controls, in that they have not imposed this rule upon industry. By instead offering businesses incentives to reduce carbon emissions through a tax reduction, they are enhancing the desire of business sectors to make the choice to become more carbon efficient.Sorensen, E. Metagovernance: The Changing Role of Politicians in Processes of Democratic Governance. American Review of Public Administration. Volume 36 2006, p. 98–114. The DECC asserts its authority over the process by the imposition of penalties if participating industries do not comply with their agreed targets. It represents the government concerning itself with the outcome of the policy, rather than regulating the entire process.Bell, S. & Hindmoor, A. Rethinking governance: the centrality of the state in modern society. Cambridge University Press 2009 Enhanced Capital Allowances (ECA) This represents a further example of a government implemented, voluntary scheme that shapes the carbon behaviour of businesses, but the actual management of this scheme is delegated to a specialised body, The Carbon Trust. The scheme encourages businesses to invest in low-carbon technology by offering a “100% first-year capital allowances on their spending on qualifying plant and machinery”.DECC website. Enhanced Capital Allowances. Accessed 16/12/2011 Only new equipment is eligible for an ECA – used or second-hand equipment does not qualify. Eligible equipment, and the criteria they have to meet, is published in the Energy Technology List. The criteria are reviewed annually to keep pace with technological progress \\"What is the ECA Scheme\\". Accessed 6/1/2013 =The Carbon Trust and the ECA= By providing a management service on behalf of the government, The Carbon Trust is actually helping govern a part of the carbon sector in England. Although created by the government in 2001, they are a private company, which means that, arguably, they represent the diminishment of central capacity to fulfil governing tasks. However, if the workings of the scheme and the part The Carbon Trust have to play is examined, then the opposite is true. In this instance DECC involved The Carbon Trust, as a body specialised in energy efficiency, and delegated responsibility to them “to ensure sufficient expertise”Heritier, A. & Lehmkuhl, D. Introduction: The Shadow of Hierarchy and New Modes of Governance. Journal of Public Policy. Volume 28 2008, pp. 1–17 (p. 9) is brought to the governing process. It is still the government's decision to delegate such responsibility, and it is their policy that is being enacted. They have simply enlisted the help of an expert body to ensure that their desired outcomes are met. Emissions trading Emissions trading constitutes a massive part of carbon governance in England. While it has been argued that this is an attempt to allow markets to govern carbon emissions by incentivising their proper managementAnderson, T. & Leal, D. Free Market Environmentalism. Westview Press 1991, p. 7. and allowing them to be traded and priced by supply and demand, the hierarchical influence of the governmental institutions, the EU and DECC, are still evident and prevent emissions trading in England in its current form being considered market governance. There are two emissions trading systems operating in England at this present moment, and the way in which they are governed is emblematic of the hierarchical nature of carbon governance at the national level. The UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) The UK Emissions Trading Scheme was a voluntary cap-and-trade scheme where participants were allocated an allowance of emissions, which included other GHGs as well as carbon, and if a participating company emitted less than their cap for that year they could trade the remaining allowances. It has now closed to new participants but allowances are still traded. While this may appear as recourse to the market to effectively govern carbon emissions, the fact remains “in order to govern through markets, governments must first create those markets through the exercise of a hierarchical authority”.Bell, S. & Hindmoor, A. Rethinking governance: the centrality of the state in modern society. Cambridge University Press 2009, p124. The UK ETS was created by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the then responsible government department, and it was the government's ambitious emissions reduction target that “spurred the UK to innovate with” Jordan, A. et al. Policy Innovation or Muddling Through? New EPIs in the UK. In A. Jordan, R. K. W. Wurzel & A. R. Zito eds. New' Instruments of Environmental Governance?: National Experiences and Prospects. Frank Cass Publishers 2003, p179-199 (p184). this particular instrument. The Trading Registry for emissions is also run through DECC, exemplifying the government's centralisation of the process and while it was left to businesses to decide how to manage their carbon emissions, and the market to decide the price, it was the governments desire to reach emissions targets and “reduce (the) economic cost”Smith, S. & Swierzbinski, J. Assessing the performance of the UK ETS. Environmental Resource Economics. Volume 37 2007, pp. 131–158 (p. 135). of doing so that was being represented. EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) Introduced by the European Commission (EC) and launched in 2005, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is similar to the UK ETS in the sense that it is a cap-and-trade scheme, but it is mandatory and its participants account for 40% of the EU's total GHG emissions.European Commission website. Emissions Trading System. Accessed 16/12/2011.. With regards to the governance of carbon in England, the scheme covers industries responsible for 48% of the UK's total carbon emissions. Because the European Commission, which supersedes the UK government in terms of legislative authority, enacted the system its introduction presents a challenge to the central power of the UK government in terms of carbon management. Rhodes cited “the loss of functions by British government to EU institutions”Rhodes, R. A. W. The Hollowing out of the State: The Changing Nature of the Public Service in Britain.The Political Quarterly. Volume 65 1994, pp. 138–151 (p. 138). as evidence of the nation state becoming ‘hollowed out’ and while this system was imposed upon England by an EU body, there is some evidence to suggest that the British government still retains some central authority. =National Allocation Plans (NAPs)= These are a calculation of an “overall cap on the total emissions allowed from all the installations covered by the EU ETS” by member states which are submitted to the EC and approved before being allocated to industries by the member states.DECC website. EU Emissions Trading System. Accessed 16/12/2011. . The presence of the NAP is a strong indication of the authority that the UK government retains over carbon governance. For it is still the UK government that is the delegator of emissions, and it is they who negotiate the UK allowances with the EC. While there has to be agreement from the EC with regards to the proposed NAP, the fact remains that the UK government is the central administrator for emissions and therefore its place in the carbon governance system in this respect has not been diminished. =The Environment Agency and the EU ETS= A large part of the administrative burden of the EU ETS falls on to The Environment Agency, a “non-departmental public body”Environment Agency website. About us. Accessed 16 December 2011. . who are actually responsible not to DECC, but to DEFRA. Although DECC are the body responsible for implementing the EU ETS into law and for the setting of the overall targets, the Environment Agency issues guidance documents, collates data on the trading of emissions and deals with applications for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Permits, which firms need in order to participate in the scheme. They also administer, on behalf of the EC, the penalties for non-compliance. These facts point towards the government and the EU seeking the expertise of a specialised body in order to fulfil their policy aims. Using The Environment Agency to assist in ensuring that the targets are met and performance of the system is maintained is not a loss of power for the government, but them ensuring that their overall targets are met by a delegation of responsibility. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme is further evidence of the UK government's “recourse to specialised regulatory remits”Bell, S. & Hindmoor, A. Rethinking governance: the centrality of the state in modern society. Cambridge University Press 2009, p. 88. in order to effectively govern carbon emissions in England. The CRC scheme is a further mandatory cap-and-trade scheme aimed at large public and private sector organisations who account for 10% of the UK's carbon emissions. It seeks to include organisations not covered by the EU ETS.DECC website. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme. Accessed 16 December 2011. . It is again reflective of the UK government's disposition towards employing market mechanisms in order to govern carbon emissions,Smith, S. & Swierzbinski, J. Assessing the performance of the UK ETS. Environmental Resource Economics. Volume 37 2007, pp. 131–158 (p. 133). and it is they who have imposed this legislation on businesses, representing an exercise of central power. However, a large bulk of the implementation of the scheme is carried out by The Environment Agency. =The Environment Agency and the CRC= The Environment Agency has a key role to play in the imposition of the scheme. It is responsible for collecting data regarding participating companies’ emissions which it then ranks in a league table “based on participant's changes in energy use against a baseline and not their total emissions”Environmental Agency website. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme. Accessed 16/12/2011. . with the hope that carbon efficiency will become a “reputational issue\\"DECC website. CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme. Accessed 16/12/2011 for those involved. The Environment Agency also hosts the CRC Registry where participants can register details and trade their emissions. It is also responsible for administering any sanctions for non-compliance. This is a classic example of the government using the skills of, in this case, a non- governmental public body in order to administer a policy they have established. Again, it is not an example of the power to govern being taken away from central government as the “enactment of legislation is evident as an explicit assertion of hierarchy”.Heritier, A. & Lehmkuhl, D. Introduction: The Shadow of Hierarchy and New Modes of Governance. Journal of Public Policy. Volume 28 2008, pp. 1–17 (p. 8). It is the government who has delegated this responsibility to The Environment Agency, and they remain the ultimate statutory authority for the scheme. Non-governmental organisations in the process  While there are several instruments employed by central government to set targets and influence carbon behaviour in businesses and in individuals, how these actors achieve the reductions being set is not specified explicitly by DECC. In this case, businesses often rely on non- governmental organisations (NGOs) to help them deliver the targets being set by government regulation. These NGOs are experts in the carbon and energy field and are therefore consulted upon by businesses and the government in order to ensure that policies are delivered effectively. In that way DECC can be said to be at the centre of a “highly centralised network”Evans, J. Environmental Governance. Routledge 2012, p. 109. of carbon governance actors. This does detract from their hierarchical authority of DECC as they are the central figure in the network, it is simply a recognition that they need to “forge coalitions with societal interests in order to achieve their policy goals”.Bell, S. & Hindmoor, A. Rethinking governance: the centrality of the state in modern society. Cambridge University Press 2009, p. 89. Climate Energy A good example of an NGO that has close links with the government and helps deliver their policy goals is Climate Energy. Established in 2005, they are an energy agency “specialising in advice and funding solutions”Climate Energy website.About us. Accessed 16 December 2011. . for businesses and homeowners to help them with carbon efficiency. They offer a range of services including a consultancy service and grants for low carbon technologies. What is important to note here is that Climate Energy is a private company and therefore has no standing within government, but it does have a significant role to play in government legislation, as exemplified below. =Climate Energy and the Carbon Emission Reduction Target (CERT)= CERT is another scheme introduced by the government that requires large energy supply companies to “make savings in the amount of CO2 emitted by householders”.DECC website. Carbon Reductions Emissions Target. Accessed 16 December 2011. . It obliges energy companies to “promote and offer funding towards measures that improve energy efficiency in the home”.Climate Energy website. Local Authorities & RSL - CERT Funding. Accessed 16 December 2011. . While a good intentioned scheme, individual householders are arguably not in a position to best judge what measures are best suited to their position, or may not be aware of what grants are available to them. Climate Energy offers a consultancy service promising to “leverage funding from utilities to support projects” for their clients through their connections in the industry. The initial government legislation was aimed at the energy suppliers with the overall aim of delivering individual household carbon reduction, but the actual delivery of this service has been performed by a private energy agency. The government is still the \\"central player\\"Bell, S. & Hindmoor, A. Rethinking governance: the centrality of the state in modern society. Cambridge University Press 2009, p. 79. in that they have implemented the policy, but Climate Energy's services ensure that it is delivered and represents further evidence of central government steering the actions of actors at lower levels. =Climate energy and The Green Deal= The Green Deal looks set to become a major part of carbon governance in the future, in that it is aimed at individual households in an attempt to improve carbon efficiency and make the transition for households to low-carbon energy as cost-effective as possible.DECC website. The Green Deal. Accessed 16 December 2011. . Climate Energy have actually been consulted by DECC as part of the consultation process before The Green Deal is implemented fully. This is representative of a discretionary style of governance, in that the government department is keen to consult specialised agencies before implementing their scheme. The citing of Climate Energy as a consultee is used to legitimise the decision as it shows that a climate and energy efficiency expert has influenced the policy. The Green Deal will still be a centrally commissioned and regulated scheme, but the consultation process allows for specialist views to be taken into account when the policy is formulated.

This hypothesis was introduced by Francesco Giavazzi and Marco Pagano in 1990 in a paper that used the fiscal restructurings of Denmark and Ireland in the 1980s as examples. The concept that fiscal contraction can result in growth is commonly known as \\"expansionary austerity\\". Theoretical basis The authors describe this as the \\"German view\\" of budget-cutting. The German view also includes the more traditional assumption that reducing government expenditures as a percent of GDP will lessen crowding out, making \\"room for the private sector to expand\\" which only operates when the economy is near full employment. The authors also did not provide a model for EFC but rather described conditions under which it was observed in Denmark from 1983–84 and Ireland from 1987–89, a period when the world was undergoing rapid interest rate declines and worldwide growth. These conditions included a significant currency devaluation prior to assuming a peg against a stable currency (Germany in Denmark's case), budget improvement through significant tax increases and spending cuts and sufficient liquidity that current disposable income did not constrain consumption. The authors stated that when current disposable income constrained consumption, \\"Keynesian textbook propositions seem to recover their predictive power, as witnessed by the 7% drop in real consumption in 1982 during the first Irish stabilization.\\" Research support and disagreements A 2009 study of the 1983-86 Denmark fiscal contraction applied structural VAR/event study methodology to test the EFC hypothesis. This study concluded that the Danish fiscal contraction had not hurt economic expansion, that the EFC hypothesis may work but only for large and credible fiscal consolidations, and that other reforms may have also played an important role. The authors warned that economic contraction, as predicted by traditional Keynesian Economics, would most likely result if government contraction was incremental rather than major and structural. An analysis of EFC using Neo-Keynesian modeling concluded that while there were situations in which consumption could be increased through fiscal contraction in all cases it was negative or neutral to employment so there must have been additional factors at work to explain the reduction in unemployment in Denmark and Ireland in the 1980s. The study concluded that Irish growth was actually lower than would have been expected without the fiscal contraction using the UK growth during the same period as a comparison. Above-average growth in Denmark was probably due to a supply-side shock in the form of the removal of wage indexation mechanisms and a temporary wage freeze which resulted in real wages contracting by 4% between 1982 and 1986. An IMF working paper by Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori published in Journal of the European Economic Association on Expansionary Austerity and the Expansionary Fiscal Contraction hypothesis that examined changes in policy designed to reduce deficits found that austerity had contractionary effects on private domestic demand and GDP. This report contradicted the conclusion of an NBER report, where Alesina and Ardagna delivered evidence in support of the Expansionary Fiscal Contraction hypothesis. The inconsistency results from the method of finding the periods of austerity policy in economic history. Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori studied narrative records in order to identify the timings of the austerity at the Treasury. In contrast, Alesina and Ardagna analyzed the changes in cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB) and defined austerity policy as a 1.5% reduction in CAPB. The two techniques of identifying expenditure reductions deliver significantly different results but neither can be considered superior. A more recent working paper by Breuer criticises Alesina and Ardagna for committing the fallacy of reverse causation in that the decrease in the expenditure-GDP ratio and increase in GDP were affected by the statistical methods adopted by the NBER report that fail to properly account for cyclical movements in the expenditure-GDP ratio. Research carried out by the United Kingdom's Office for Budget Responsibility indicates that the austerity policies enacted in the United Kingdom had the effects of reducing the 2011-2012 economic growth by 1.4 percent.

The prototype first flew in the United States in November 2000 and by 2003 seven others had flown. By late 2017, over 130 had flown. Variants ;F1 Rocket :Tandem-seat variant using a 6 cylinder Lycoming IO-540 or Continental IO-550 engine of 250-350 HP. The wing on the F1 is similar to the Vans RV-4 wing, a rectangular design with slotted ailerons, and bottom hinged flaps. The canopy may be a slider or flip over design, but most use the slider design. F1 Evo ;F1 Evo: Evolutionary variant design, utilized a tapered wing as compared to the rectangular wing on the F1. Significant changes were made to the aileron and flap design. F1 Evo uses the same fuselage and tail as the original F1. The Evo wing is no longer available.

Company history Founder Andrew Wilson was inspired by the famous duck tours of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. The company started running tours in Boston with four Ducks and now runs a fleet of 28. The first departure location was on Long Wharf in front of the New England Aquarium. In 1997 the Boston Duck Tours operation was moved to the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston at the Prudential Center. In 2002, Boston Duck Tours opened a second departure and ticketing location at the Museum of Science. In 2009, Boston Duck Tours opened a third departure and ticketing location at the New England Aquarium. Boston Duck Tours carries approximately 600,000 passengers per year. A Boston Duck Tour DUKW in the Charles River In 2002, the Boston Duck Tour Ducks were first used as the parade vehicles for the New England Patriots after the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI over the St. Louis Rams. Since that time, the Boston Duck Tour Ducks have participated in 12 professional sports championship parades in Boston. There have been six for New England Patriots (2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, 2019), four for the Boston Red Sox (2004, 2007, 2013, 2018), one for the Boston Celtics (2008), and one for the Boston Bruins (2011).Duck Boats Ready For Bruins Rolling Rally On Saturday « CBS Boston With these parades having become a frequent occurrence since 2002, \\"Cue the Duck Boats\\" has become a popular catchphrase in Boston among the city's sports fans. The Duck Boats were first planned to be used for the New England Patriots in 1997 however they did not win Super Bowl XXXI. While much of the parade routes over the years consisted of the DUKWs staying on land, some featured the DUKWs traversing both the land and across the Charles River. In 2010, Boston Duck Tours was asked to help transport flood victims in Wayland, MA. Torrential rains had left the Pelham Island area of Wayland isolated and the Ducks were brought in to ferry people in and out of their neighborhood until the waters receded. On August 7, 2014, Boston Duck Tours retired its last remaining original World War II DUKW from regularly- scheduled tours. As of 2015 all regular tours are conducted on replica DUKWs that are larger and easier to repair than the original vehicles, and run on bio diesel.

He is best known for his ardent devotion to the Sacred Heart and for his constant promotion of it until his premature death. His beatification by the Catholic Church was held in Valladolid on 18 April 2010. Life Bernardo Francisco de Hoyos de Seña was born on 21 August 1711 to Don Manuel de Hoyos and Doña Francisca de Seña. He was baptized on 6 September in his local parish church in the names of \\"Bernardo Francisco Javier\\"; he was named in honor of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and Saint Francis Xavier. His father worked at the town hall at Torrelobatón near Valladolid. He received his Confirmation in 1720. He entered the Jesuit colleges of Medina del Campo and Villagarcía de Campos and later entered the novitiate under the direction of Father Félix de Vargas on 11 July 1726. He took his simple vows in 1728. He underwent philosophical studies at the College of San Pedro i San Pablo in Medina del Campo. In September 1731 he started began his theological studies at the College of San Ambrosio in Valladolid. He had spiritual experiences and revelations about the Sacred Heart of Jesus that led him to spread this devotion and worship. He was ordained to the priesthood on 2 January 1735 with a special dispensation as he was not old enough. On 6 January 1735 he celebrated his first Mass in the College of San Ignacio. In late April 1733 he received a letter from his friend Father Augustine Cadaveraz (in Bilbao) after he had requested the priest to translate a Latin chapter on Corpus Christi from Father Joseph de Gallifet's book \\"On Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus\\". On 3 May 1733 he took the book from the library of the house and took it to his room where he began to read it; the Sacred Heart both inspired and illuminated him. On 4 May he received a vision from Jesus Christ who said to him: \\"I wish for you to spread the devotion to My Sacred Heart throughout all of Spain\\". Christ returned to him in another vision on 14 May. On 12 June 1733 he consecrated himself to the Sacred Heart using the same formula that Saint Claude de la Colombière used. He distributed leaflets for the devotion and even wrote a letter to King Philip V asking for his support in requesting the Holy See to approve a special feast for the Sacred Heart. In 1726 both Aloysius Gonzaga and Stanislaus Kostka were both canonized by Pope Benedict XIII; the two became models of holiness for the Jesuit priest as well as John Berchmans who was already on the course for canonization. Berchmans in particular was a main influence on him. He fell ill with typhus and he died on 29 November 1735 at the Colegio de San Ignacio; his condition grew worse from 19 November onwards. His remains were buried in the College of San Ignacio; his remains were later removed afterwards to an unknown place. Beatification Bernardo's beatification in 2010. The beatification process started in the Archdiocese of Valladolid in an informative process that Cardinal Antonio María Cascajares y Azara inaugurated on 17 October 1895 and later closed in 1899 while his writings received the approval of theologians on 7 June 1902; an apostolic process was also held in Valladolid that Cardinal José Cos y Macho oversaw from 1914 until 1919. The formal introduction to the cause came on 11 February 1914 under Pope Pius X and the late Jesuit priest was made a Servant of God. Historians assessed and approved the cause on 31 May 1961 while the postulation submitted the Positio to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1990. Theologians assented to the cause later on 27 June 1995 as did the C.C.S. on 12 December 1995. Pope John Paul II named him as Venerable on 12 January 1996 after confirming that the late Jesuit priest had lived a life of heroic virtue. The process for a miracle spanned in Spain from 11 November 1947 to 8 October 1949 while being validated on 1 March 1996; the miracle in question was the cure of Mercedes Cabezas on 22 April 1936 from typhoid and a serious tumor in San Cristóbal de la Cuesta in Salamanca. A medical board approved this on 13 March 2008 with theologians doing likewise on 7 July 2008 and the C.C.S. soon after on 18 November 2008. Pope Benedict XVI approved this on 17 January 2009 and delegated Archbishop Angelo Amato to preside over the beatification in Spain on 18 April 2010. The current postulator for the cause is the Jesuit priest Anton Witwer.

This example was found in Blessington, eastern Ireland. British Museum Rillaton Cup, one of two similar cups found in Britain. British Museum Gold working in the Bronze Age British Isles refers to the use of gold to produce ornaments and other prestige items in the British Isles during the Bronze Age, between circa 2500 and c.800 BCE in Britain, and up to about 550 BCE in Ireland. In this period, communities in Britain and Ireland first learned how to work metal, leading to the widespread creation of not only gold but also copper and bronze items as well. Gold artefacts in particular were prestige items used to designate the high status of those individuals who wore, or were buried with them. Around 1,500 gold objects dating to the Bronze Age survive in collections, around 1000 of them from Ireland and the other 500 from Britain; this is a much smaller number than would have been originally crafted, leading archaeologists to believe that \\"many thousands of gold objects were made and used\\" in the Bronze Age British Isles. Irish gold \\"gorget\\", 800-700 BC, found Tonyhill, Co Clare. NMI, Dublin Records indicate that Bronze Age gold artefacts had begun to be discovered by the 18th century at the least, although at the time many were melted down or lost. Only with the rise of the antiquarian and then archaeological movements were the antiquity of these items recognised, after which they were more usually preserved in collections. The archaeologist George Eogan noted that investigation of Bronze Age gold artefacts revealed not only \\"the work of craftsmen and technicians\\" from that period but also aided our understanding of \\"broader aspects of society such as social stratification, trade, commerce and ritual.\\" Background Gold and gold-working in prehistoric Europe In prehistory gold could be found in several areas of Europe; the Carpathian region, Iberia, south-western France, Brittany, Britain and Ireland.Eogan 1994. p. 1.Coles and Harding 1979. p. 261. The latter in particular had rich gold reserves, and as such has been labelled an \\"ancient El Dorado\\".Hawkes 1961. p. 138. Across the world, and in many cultures, gold has been highly valued as a precious metal, in part because of its rarity and also because of its properties; for instance, unlike copper it is malleable, flexible and homogenous, and can be worked by hammering, rather than having to be worked through casting, annealing or soldering. Any products made from gold do not corrode, but instead have what has been described as an \\"intrinsic beauty\\", with many prehistoric peoples probably ascribing gold items a \\"symbolic as well as a decorative function\\". Bronze Age Britain and Ireland First developed in 1836 by Danish archaeologist Christian Jürgensen Thomsen as a part of his \\"Three-age system\\", the term \\"Bronze Age\\" is used by archaeologists to refer to those societies which have developed bronze technology but not yet learned how to work the more complicated process involved in making iron objects. The European Bronze Age lasted from circa 3200 BCE, when the Aegean civilizations of Greece first developed bronze technology, right through to c.600 BCE, when the Nordic Bronze Age came to an end with the development of iron among Scandinavian communities. The extent of the \\"Beaker Package\\" across Europe, which was accompanied by the use of Beaker pottery, metal and specialised burials. The period known by archaeologists as Bronze Age Britain lasted from c.2500 BCE through to c.800 BCE, and was defined by the adoption of copper and bronze technologies on the island.Adkins, Adkins and Leitch 2008. p. 64. Bronze Age Ireland followed a similar, yet distinct course. The Early Bronze Age in the British Isles was marked by the adoption of what archaeologists call the \\"Beaker culture\\", which had arrived from continental Europe. Eogan noted that the \\"evidence from archaeology is that Beaker-using communities were the earliest metallurgists in Britain and Ireland\\", with their produce including \\"copper artefacts such as tanged daggers but also gold objects as well as the use of gold for embellishment.\\" Styles and development The Mold Cape is a unique survival from North Wales. British Museum Bronze Age goldwork is marked by an elegant simplicity of design and fine execution, with decoration usually restricted to relatively simple geometric patterns such as parallel lines, chevron, zig-zag and circular patterns, often extremely small and perfectly executed, especially in Ireland, as can be seen by enlarging the lunula and Irish bracelet illustrated. The objects are nearly all pieces of jewellery, and include clothes-fasteners (somewhat like large one-piece cuff-links), torcs, bracelets, gold lunulae, smaller ornaments that were perhaps worn in the ear, nose or hair, or on clothing as brooches, and a range of thin disc or plaques probably sewn to clothing or worn in the hair. The ends of objects that are essentially bars bent into a round shape often thicken before ending in a flat or concave face, as for example in the Milton Keynes Hoard. The thickening is typically slight in torcs and bracelets, but extreme in clothes fasteners and ear decorations. Tightly wound spirals in pairs are popular, as they were on the continent. Early Bronze Age Eogan (1994) noted that around 250 surviving gold objects are known to date to the Early Bronze Age, 165 of those from Ireland, and the other 83 from Britain.Eogan 1994. p. 13. From analysing the designs of the earliest gold artefacts in Britain, Eogan noted that they \\"form a homogeneous group\\" which, when \\"taken in conjunction with other metal types demonstrate that a new technology was introduced.\\"Eogan 1994. p. 18. Early Bronze Age pieces are generally much smaller, with very thin decorated discs or plaques common. Two small gold cups have been found in England, the Rillaton Cup and the similar but now crushed Ringlemere Cup. Due to its natural resources, Ireland had a \\"rich Early Bronze Age [metal-working] industry\\", producing large quantities of metal axes, halberds and daggers, and as a part of this also had a \\"major gold industry\\", seeing the production of lunulae and gold disks on a far larger scale than Britain.Eogan 1994. p. 37. Late Bronze Age The Lambourn Hoard, from Lambourn, Berkshire, with three bracelets and two folded twisted torcs (West Berkshire Museum). The transition to the Late Bronze Age brought societal change to the British Isles, and also apparently increased availability of gold, which led to a trend to much larger and more massive pieces. The largest were jewellery worn round the neck in a range of styles, the most ostentatious wide flat collars or gorgets with ribbed decoration following the shape of the piece, and round discs at the side. The Mold Cape is unique among survivals, but fits in with the trend to massive pieces emphasizing the neck and chest. It was clearly not for prolonged wear, as the wearer could not raise their arms. In Ireland, lunulae were probably replaced as neck ornaments firstly by gold torcs, found from the Irish Middle Bronze Age, and then in the Late Bronze Age by the spectacular \\"gorgets\\" of thin ribbed gold, some with round discs at the side, of which 9 examples survive, 7 in the National Museum of Ireland.Wallace, 88-89; 3:19-25 Designs based on twisted bars or ribbons giving a spiral became popular, probably influenced by the Continent. \\"Although over 110 identifiable British [includes Ireland] ribbon torcs are known, the dating of these simple, flexible ornaments is elusive\\", perhaps indicating \\"a long-lived preference for ribbon torcs, which continued for over 1,000 years\\", into the Iron Age.Taylor, 63 Gold in Bronze Age society Irish bracelet, c. 950-c. 800 BC, using a shape that is varied across a range of sizes and functions.

In Bronze Age Britain, gold objects were prestigious items, and archaeologists believe that those who owned them, or were buried with them, had a high status in society. Archaeologist George Eogan noted that gold reflected \\"ostentation in society, a society that has divisions along rank.\\"Eogan 1994. p. 38. Antiquarian and archaeological investigation Archaeologist George Eogan, in his study of Bronze Age gold-working, noted that very few Bronze Age gold artefacts had been discovered through \\"controlled archaeological investigation\\", with the majority instead having been unearthed \\"by chance\\", as a result of \\"agricultural activities or peat- cutting\\".Eogan 1994. p. 2.

In 1696, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, southern England obtained the Ballyshannon Disk, the first such artefact of its type in their collection, although in ensuing centuries they would gain a number of other items to accompany it.Eogan 1994. p. 3.

It tells the story of the separation of two neighbouring villages of Kenya caused by differences in faith set in the decades of roughly the early 20th century. The bitterness between them caused much hatred between the adults of each side. The story tells about the struggle of a young leader, Waiyaki, to unite the two villages of Kameno and Makuyu through sacrifice and pain. The novel is set during the colonial period, when white settlers arrived in Kenya's \\"White Highlands\\", and has a mountain setting.  Plot Summary  A young man called Waiyaki is a focal point in Ngugi’s story. At an early age, he was already considered to have special gifts. Waiyaki once encountered two boys fighting and attempted to break up the squabble. Although he was the youngest of the three, he was able to put a stop to the violence. Ngugi reveals the three boys, Waiyaki, Kamau and Kinuthia are all destined to study at a local mission school nearby and from there, to become teachers. Waiyaki is eventually enrolled at the school at the behest of his father, Chege. He explains to young Waiyaki the legend of a savior who would be born into their village and accomplish great things for his people. Waiyaki’s father believes that he is that savior. Although Waiyaki is skeptical of such a fantastical prophesy, he excels in the school and is well on his way to playing a vital role in the development of his people. The significance of Chege’s eagerness to send Waiyaki to the mission school rests on the fact that the boy would be in a position to learn the wisdom of the colonists. This knowledge would Waiyaki equip him for the struggle against the colonial government. Despite the liberating potential of this knowledge, Waiyaki must ensure he does not embrace the colonial system, as doing so would defeat the purpose of his training. As the story progresses, the division between the two villages intensifies and the proposed circumcision of the young girl Muthoni causes much dissention within the community. Her death galvanizes the missionary school—in which Waiyaki is enrolled—into action, going so far as to expel children whose parents still uphold the tradition of circumcision. Waiyaki is among those forced from the school. In response, he decides to take up the challenge of building a school for the expelled children. While he still does not fully understand the leadership role his father predicted he would take up, he begins to realize that his mission is to enable education for the children of the villages. He becomes so preoccupied with this goal that he fails to recognize and address the other needs of his community, such as reclaiming lands seized by the colonists. Some villagers begin conspiring behind closed doors, eventually forming a secret organization known as Kiama, whose singular purpose is to ensure the purity of the tribe. As a result of this upheaval, Waiyaki makes enemies. Among them is Kabonyi who begins to provoke dissenters in the community to undermine and destroy Waiyaki. Eventually, Waiyaki succumbs to Kabonyi’s trickery. While he desires nothing more than to quell the growing unrest within the village, and heal the angst among the people, he is powerless to undo the polarizing effects of colonialism. Waiyaki blames himself for having failed to address the lack of unity in time. The story concludes on an ominous note. Waiyaki and his new love interest Nyambura find themselves in the hands of the Kiama who would then decide their fate. What happens beyond that remains a mystery. Characters * Waiyaki: an ambitious young man who tries to save his people from the white man by building schools and providing education. * Chege: Waiyaki's father. He is a well-respected elder of his tribe, presiding over a range of ceremonies. He also knows all the prophecies, including the invasion of the white people with their clothes like butterflies, and a savior rising to face this threat. * Joshua: Father of Muthoni and Nyambura, he represents the influence of the white man and is one of Waiyaki's antagonists. He was one of the first people to be converted to Christianity, seeking refuge in Siriana because he feared the revenge and anger of his people, who felt betrayed. He becomes increasingly religious until he is almost a fanatic, renouncing his tribe's rituals and traditions. Considering his people to live in darkness, he is dedicated to converting as many people as possible to save them from hell. * Muthoni: she is Joshua's younger daughter, instead of following the Christian way of life, she follows the traditional path and chooses to get circumcised to become a woman. However, the circumcision leads to medical complications, and even though Waiyaki managed to get her to a hospital, she dies after claiming that she sees Jesus. * Nyambura: Muthoni's older sister, but not as revolutionary because she is not as independent. While Muthoni openly rebels against her father, Nyambura follows him because she fears his anger. She falls in love with Waiyaki and started a secret affair which lead to his downfall as their relationship is considered a treason amongst the council. * Kabonyi: He is the father of Kamau, he represents the council of the elders and, therefore, the conservative forces within the community. He detests Waiyaki due to conflicting ideologies and fearing that Waiyaki may be the one sent to save the people. Eventually, however, Kabonyi is able to punish Waiyaki during a council meeting, effectively ending the struggle for reconciliation. * Kinuthia: A close and loyal friend of Waiyaki's and a teacher at Marioshoni. Kinuthia loves Waiyaki and thinks he is a great leader, but he often warns his friend of imminent trouble. At Waiyaki's final stand, he is nearly crippled with fear and foreboding; he can say nothing to dissuade the Kiama from punishment. * Kamau: Kabonyi's son and peer of Waiyaki; he is a teacher at Marioshoni. Kamau is extremely jealous of Waiyaki, especially when he realizes Nyambura loves Waiyaki. He works with his father to topple Waiyaki from his perch of power. * Livingstone: The British missionary who founds Siriana and carries on a more than twenty-five-year outreach in the ridges. He is devoted to getting rid of circumcision, which he considers to be a barbaric practice. * Miriamu: Joshua's wife and mother to Muthoni and Nyambura. She is a devout Christian, but she still has a Gikuyu spirit inside. She loves her daughters and weeps for their sorrows, but she believes that they must obey their father. Major Themes Colonialism/Imperialism The River Between is an allegory of the colonization of Kenya when the British introduced Christianity and exploited the country. Joshua represents the converted African who does everything in his power to support the colonialists, represented by a man called Livingston (possibly referring to David Livingston, the pioneer missionary). The British secure their power by building government posts and collecting taxes, which at first does not concern the people because they do not know what taxes are. Only later do they realize that they are exploited. Therefore, Waiyaki tries to lead his people to independence through (Western) education, after his father tells him, \\"Learn all the wisdom and all the secrets of the white man. But do not follow his vices.\\" However, in the end, he realizes that education alone is not enough to improve the lives of the people. Instead, it is necessary that the community gains self-respect through political action uniting the different tribes. Individual vs. Community The two characters that try to follow their own agenda without first consulting with the elders and their community meet with an unfavorable end. Waiyaki keeps building more schools in an attempt to provide education to the people, but even though he has good intentions, he underestimates the power of the council of the elders, who consider adhering to ancient traditions more important than taking over parts of the white man's culture. In the end, he is punished by the council and the people, which indicates that all his efforts were in vain. Similarly, Muthoni goes against the will of her father and Christian community when she decides to follow the traditions and get circumcised to become part of the tribe. Muthoni dies because of this procedure, which also indicates that reconciliation is impossible. Self-Knowledge Waiyaki's main flaw seems to be that he is not entirely self-aware. He knows he is a vital member of the community and most of the time sees himself as the savior from Chege's prophecy, but he is incapable of acknowledging that his vision for the tribe may not be what the tribe actually needs. He also cannot really see how crucial his failure to talk about unity was, and how he is being selfish by putting it off. He ignores aspects of what his elevated role in the society might mean for himself and others. Tradition Tradition is exceedingly significant to a society, especially in terms of their founding history, rites, rituals, etc. The Kikuyu have long held their own beliefs on these subjects, and the white man's influence is seen as deleterious to those beliefs. Ngugi suggests that not all new ideas are bad—Waiyaki and Muthoni and Nyambura articulate the need for a fusion between Christianity and tribal tradition—and that traditions can be problematic. He is aware, though, that traditions are excessively difficult to change or eradicate, and that the white man and his African supporters cannot expect to order the Kikuyu to get rid of something overnight. Rather, patience and understanding are necessary. Unity and Division Ngugi evinces complicated views on human nature, suggesting that both unity and division can be sustaining and dangerous in various circumstances. The two ridges are unified by the river but at the same time divided by it; there is neutral ground but it is nearly impossible to occupy. Division is present in the novel through the white man and his religion/education/influence; as we watch, various Kikuyu come down on either side of these encroachments. Division is natural because a population cannot be perfectly homogeneous; however, these divisions can become dangerous when they are accompanied by violence, ignorance, and intolerance. There is a need for unity on the basis of something deeper to preclude the complete fraying of a society. Thus, by the end of the novel unity is needed to patch the two ridges together in order to maintain autonomy over a way of life—but Ngugi indicates that this is a difficult thing to achieve. The Land The land is of paramount importance in the text. Ngugi begins the novel with an image of its ancient presence, its sustaining nature, and its centrality to rite and ritual (as seen, for example, in the way that the circumcision and initiation ceremonies are tied to the river). The land is tied to culture, and when the Kikuyu feel like their land is under siege by the white man, it is so much more than that. That the white man builds on their land, taxes their land, and eventually will take their land is what so horrifies the Kiama; even though Waiyaki is the central protagonist, the reader feels sympathetic to the Kiama's goal of routing the outsiders. Courage The characters in The River Between exhibit courage in a variety of ways. Sometimes this courage is standing up to family or to the community, and sometimes it is being honest with oneself. Muthoni has convictions that necessitate her standing up to her family, and Nyambura stands up to her family and her community for love. Similarly, Waiyaki demonstrates courage as he pursues his goal of education, as he seeks unity between the ridges, and as he defends his love for Nyambura. Having courage doesn't guarantee a positive outcome, but it can foster a sense of wholeness and peace in a person.

He was an illegitimate son of Sir Henry Knyvet of Charlton, Wiltshire. In 1591 he joined an English privateer, Thomas Cavendish, on a voyage aimed at raiding Portuguese holdings in Brazil. Cavendish was at the height of his fame, having completed a successful voyage around the world from 1586 to 1588. After Cavendish's men had raided the town of Santos and destroyed several Portuguese sugar plantations, they traveled on and eventually left Knivet, who had developed frostbite in the Strait of Magellan, along with nineteen other sick or mutinous men on the then remote island of Ilhabela. He was captured by the Portuguese and was put to work as a slave on a sugar plantation. Later he was tasked with traveling inland and contacting natives in order to obtain more slaves. After a failed escape attempt, he was sent back to a plantation, where he attacked his owner and fled again. He met a native who had also fled from slavery, and together they made it to an indigenous Brazilian tribe of Tupí people, where they stayed for nine months. Sold for metal tools back to the Portuguese, he was forced to work for the governor of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador Correia de Sá, o Velho. He managed to escape to West Africa (Congo and Angola). The Rio governor obtained his extradition to Brazil and he then returned with the governor to Portugal, from where he finally made his way back to England in 1601. Upon return, Knivet wrote his memoir and sold it to Richard Hakluyt, who sold it on to Samuel Purchas. Purchas published an abbreviated version in his Purchas his Pilgrimes (1613) and a more complete version under the title \\"The Admirable Adventures and Strange Fortunes of Master Antonie Knivet, which went with Master Thomas Candish in his Second Voyage to the South Sea, 1591\\" in Purchas his Pilgrimes, part IV, book 6, chapter 7 (London 1625). This work was reprinted in 1906. Excerpts about his time in Africa were published as \\"Appendix I: Anthony Knivet in Kongo and Angola\\" of The strange adventures of Andrew Battell of Leigh, in Angola and the adjoining regions, 1901. While Knivet's descriptions of Brazil are generally precise and believable, his writing about Africa contains several mistakes and contradictions.E. G. Ravenstein (ed.), The strange adventures of Andrew Battell of Leigh, in Angola and the adjoining regions, London 1901. Appendix I: Anthony Knivet in Kongo and Angola The published memoir suffers from Purchas' deletion of several sections; it is possible that these were motivated by his negative attitude towards Catholicism. Anthony Knivet went on to become co-teller of the Royal Mint, thanks to intervention by his uncle Thomas Knyvet who had served as Warden of the Mint and was famous for having foiled the Gunpowder Plot.

In 2002 it had 949 students, of whom 747 participated in Romanian and 202 in Hungarian language education.  History  The high school was formed by the Calvinist community in Zilah (present-day Zalău) in the first half of the 17th century. Initially, lessons were held in Latin, which was later replaced by Hungarian. In the 1830s, following a disagreement between the school and the church, Miklós Wesselényi took over the burden of the institution and paid the teachers wage and other fees himself. In remembrance of this service to the school, it later took the name of Wesselényi. In 1848, led by their teachers, the students from the upper class joined the Hungarian Revolution, for which after the failure of the revolution the college feared of abolition by the Habsburg authorities. The main building of the high school was built in 1903 with the support of the Wesselényi family. In 1948, due to the Communist takeover, the school was nationalized and ceased to exist as a faith school. At this time it was renamed from Wesselényi Reformed College to simply Liceum nr. 2 and served as a Hungarian language institution. In 1960 it was unified with the Romanian language high school and since then language education has been given in both languages. Between 1953 and 1965, the high school was called Ady Endre (for a notable former graduate), then Liceul de Matematică-Fizică, Liceul Teoretic and, after 2001, Colegiul Național „Silvania”.

Kamalov was shot dead in an apparent assassination as his name had been put on a hit list for his reporting on Muslim rebel activity in the Republic of Dagestan, and he had been well known for his reporting on corruption. His death is said to have had a chilling effect on other journalists. Personal life Gadzhimurat Kamalov, an ethnic Avar, was born in the village of Sogratl, in the Gunibsky District of Dagestan, Russia. He was married and had one child. His uncle, Ali Kamalov, was the chair of the Union of Journalists in Dagestan at the time his nephew was killed. He was educated in engineering at the Dagestan Polytechnic Institute in 1982 and later at the Leningrad Technical University in 1990. Kamalov began his journalism career by working at the New Business (Russian: Новое Дело). After founding a major newspaper in Dagestan, he served as press secretary for President Mukhu Aliyev, whose term lasted from 2006 to 2010. Kamalov was also a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under President Magomedsalam Magomedov. Work On 19 August 2003, Kamalov founded the newspaper Chernovik (, which translates as \\"Rough Draft\\"), which was well known for investigating government corruption in Dagestan. The most controversial article published in Chernovik was \\"Terrorist No. 1\\", which included quotes from Rappani Khalilov, in July 2008, and that led to a legal case between the government and Chernovik that lasted until May 2011. Khalilov was killed on 18 September 2007 before the article was published. He had been sought after as a high-profile terrorist target because of his involvement in the 1999 raid from Chechnya into Dagestan and a 2002 bombing that killed 40 people. The editor of Chernovik was called to the prosecutor's office and warned before charges were filed. According to Nadira Isayeva, the editor-in- chief of Chernovik at the time it published the Khalilov article and during its legal struggles, \\"Khadzhimurad had many enemies. He wasn't afraid to spell out his motto: 'A newspaper does not need friends.' He was not without an element of the cavalier. He could go off for some meeting with some frostbitten bandits and come back unharmed. He loved investigating corruption. Many of those exposed by his revelations – senior civil servants, police officers and staff at the prosecutor's office – had criminal pasts, and presents. Some were dangerous and not afraid of killing. Often there were confrontations with the heads of Dagestan's municipalities, many of whom are bandits.\\" Biyakai Magomedov, the current editor of Chernovik, said, \\"The corrupt structures have been afraid of us. [...] They couldn’t defeat us in courts, because we won practically all the cases.\\" The main case against Chernovik had ended in acquittal on 19 May 2011. At one point, when Chernovik lost its financial backers, Kamalov took out loans using his flat as collateral, despite the fact that his wife and child lived there. He also would sell off office equipment, until he finally found new backers. As the owner, Kamalov did not interfere with the editorial content of the newspaper and he encouraged his journalists to report the truth, according to accounts by Mairbek Agayev, a political columnist for Chernovik, and Mahir Pashayev, a business and economics reporter. \\"It is the only newspaper without any censorship,\\" said Pashayev. Media source Besides being behind the news, Gadzhimurat Kamalov was often called on to be a source for media outlets who were looking for an expert to analyze the deteriorating situation in Dagestan. Ekho Moskvy radio, Moscow, 8 July 2005 :[Kamalov]: \\"Neither the opposition, nor the Republic of Dagestan's official regional authorities, will be able to sort this situation out [... ] I can tell you that the people are increasingly going to the mosques already with the fully conscious understanding that the laws of the Russian Federation cannot operate in the Republic of Dagestan, but that the alternative traditional laws work. To be more exact, those with a basis in Shar'iah law work. And so the number of people with such an understanding of legislation and law-enforcement is increasing. And neither the opposition, nor the regional authorities, faced with this fully formed third force are able to handle this.\\" Kamalov questions security operation On 28 June 2008, Kamalov told Ekho Moskvy, Moscow, that the security forces had killed three people who were not militants but one was a university educator whom Kamalov knew. Kamalov said, \\"A knock on the door [...] is considered a dangerous thing here. Here everybody is afraid of the police. He once told me that if at any time they would come to his place, he would refuse to open the door. It was precisely because he was afraid of an unauthorized search of his flat that [he] must have refused to open the door to them. Thus, they had a justification to storm the flat.\\" The same account was published in print. Activism On 26 September 2005, Gadzhimurat Kamalov organized an unprecedented protest in Makhachkala against the action of the Federal Agency for the Press and Mass Communication to stop the printing and distribution of issues of the Chernovik. Fifty journalists and supporters participated in the protest. On 25 November 2011, Kamalov led a protest of somewhere between 3,000 and 5,700 participants against the unlawful use of force and the disappearance of civilians allegedly by security forces, an issue on which Chernovik has focused. Death Kamalov was shot eight times as he was exiting Chernovik's headquarters on Magomed Hajiyev Street in Makhachkala, Dagestan, a Russian province in the north Caucasus region, around 11:45 p.m., 15 December 2011. The gunman was masked, shot 14 rounds in total, and sped away from the scene of the crime in a black Lada Priora. Kamalov had previously received death threats in September 2009 when he was one of eight journalists included in a hit list distributed anonymously in Makhachkala. The list claimed to be seeking revenge for the deaths of police and civilians during Dagestan's unrest. Kamalov may have been included for his sympathetic portrayals of rebel fighters. Hundreds attended Kamalov's funeral. Reactions Tanya Lokshina, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Moscow, said: \\"Kamalov's death is terrible and it will have a monstrous effect on the free press in Dagestan. He had many enemies because of Chernovik's searching reports on corrupt businesses and the transgressions of the local siloviki [law enforcement bodies].\\" Lokshina blamed the murder on the Russian authorities' governing of the region: \\"Even if there was a personal aspect to his murder then it became possible because of the atmosphere of complete impunity which the Russian authorities have allowed to flourish there.\\" The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said that the \\"murder of Gadzhimurat Kamalov [...] is a lethal blow to press freedom\\", adding that his murder was \\"a massive loss for independent journalism in the North Caucasus, Russia's most dangerous place for reporters\\". The CPJ had already awarded its press freedom award in 2010 to Chernovik former editor Nadira Isayeva,Killing of Dagestani journalist must be investigated, Committee to Protect Journalists, retrieved 16 December 2011 and the newspaper's reputation for modern muckraker journalism was well known outside of the North Caucasus. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and UNESCO both called for a credible investigation into the Kamalov assassination. Irina Bokova, the director- general of UNESCO, said, \\"Fear must not be allowed to muzzle media professionals, deny reporters the basic human right of freedom of expression and bar citizens from accessing information.\\" Magomedsalam Magomedov, president of Dagestan, said: \\"He always came out for unity and peace, and carrying out dialogue [...] This is a big loss not just for journalists, but for the whole republic.\\" The president's office officially took control over the murder investigation. Saygidpasha Umakhanov, a prominent mayor in Dagestan, said, \\"[Gadzhimurat] was indeed an independent and honest journalist. It's impossible to find another like him.... His numerous friends and the healthy forces in society will do everything to find the killer. [But for that] we really need to be united.\\" Impact Yulia Latynina, an expert on the Caucasus region, said, \\"Just as [Anna] Politkovskaya's death meant the loss of information about Chechnya, Kamalov's death will mean that to a large extent we will stop to understand what's going on in Dagestan. People will simply be scared to write anything.\\" Context According to the BBC, assassination in Dagestan has become routine as the levels of violence in the autonomous Republic of Dagestan have risen. The republic is seated between the Caspian Sea and Chechnya. Whereas in Chechnya, rebels have been advocating independence from Russia, in Dagestan the conflict with the rebels is described as more diffuse. Dagestan is a muli-ethnic country with Avars being the largest among them. The majority of citizens practice Sufi Islam but younger people are attracted to the Salafist brand of Islam. The mafia is active throughout the country and use violence, kidnapping and murder to intimidate victims. The security forces in the country are visible and also use violence to achieve their goals. The problems of Chechnya have spilled over into Dagestan since war broke out there in the early 1990s and the struggle with Dagestan's Muslim rebels has been going on since that time. In the last years, the situation has become more intense. The problems feeding the violence in Dagestan are therefore a diffuse blend of ethnic, religious, generational, criminal, and authoritarian causes. Dagestan's press is described by both BBC News and Reporters Without Borders as \\"pluralistic,\\" but the availability of many sources has not lowered tensions. Dunja Mijatovic, who is the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Representative on Freedom of the Media, said, \\"Daghestan and the Northern Caucasus are known to be among the most dangerous places in the world for journalists.\\" Press freedom organizations, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Without Borders, have called for the immediate investigation of Kamalov's murder. Russia, however, is on the CPJ's list of the top 10 countries with the worst records of impunity in the killing of journalists. From 2000 until the time of Kamalov's death, Russia has accrued 18 unsolved cases of murders of journalists, according to the CPJ. CPJ lists three journalists from Dagestan before Kamalov who have been killed since 2000 in Makhachkala: * Malik Akhmedilov, the daily editor of the Hakikat (Translated: The Truth), was killed on 11 August 2009. * Abdulla Alishayev, a TV host on TV-Chirkei, was killed on 2 September 2008. * Magomedzagid Varisov, the editor of Novoye Delo, was killed on 28 June 2005. Other journalists who were killed but were unconfirmed by CPJ: * Gadzhi Abashilov, the head of Dagestan's state broadcasting company, was killed in Makhachkala on 21 March 2008. Additionally, Reporters Without Borders lists: * Yakhya Magomedov, a journalist working for Assalam (Russian: Ассалам), was killed in Kokrek, Dagestan on 8 May 2011. The newspapers in Dagestan with the highest circulations have all experienced the murder of one of their journalists. The top selling news products in Dagestan, include Assalam, which has the highest circulation and is a moderate Muslim bi-weekly; Novoye Delo and Chernovik. Unlike the others, Chernovik is an independent newspaper. The newspaper targets the civically engaged audience demographic between the ages of 28 to 45, which makes up 80% of its readership. The popularity of the media has a negative side. The media are caught in the middle as they are a visible target in which all the forces facing Dagestan can attack to get at their enemies (p. 9).

Heathcote was born into a gentry family in 1777, the son of a baronet. He entered the navy several years before the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, and after seeing action in the Mediterranean, was advanced to lieutenant in 1795. After several acting commands he became a post-captain but saw no further service until the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. He took a frigate out to the West Indies, and achieved some successes against privateers. An attempt to cut out a moored privateer in 1804 ended in failure and heavy casualties after the French defenders were forewarned. Heathcote then went out to the East Indies commanding a ship of the line. After service transporting the ambassadors to Persia, he was based on the Indian coast. While there he took a bold decision to open despatches and then quit his post to deliver them to the station commanders, who were at the time involved in the Java Expedition. He was court-martialed for this, but though several charges were proved, he was judged to have acted in the service's best interests, and was acquitted. He went out to the Mediterranean late in the Napoleonic Wars, and commanded the inshore squadron during the blockade of Toulon. He led one of the last attacks on the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Action of 5 November 1813, and retired ashore after the end of the wars. He developed a new technique for hoisting staysails, received further promotions, and a knighthood, while in retirement, before his death in 1851 at the rank of admiral. Family and early life Henry Heathcote was born on 20 January 1777, the fourth son of Sir William Heathcote, 3rd Baronet and his wife, Frances. William Heathcote was Member of Parliament for Hampshire between 1790 and 1806, and had his seat, Hursley House, in that county. Henry's younger brother, Gilbert, would also have a naval career, dying a post-captain in 1831. Henry Heathcote entered the navy in 1790, serving aboard the 74-gun under Captain Archibald Dickson in the English Channel. He served on several other ships during the last years of peace and the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, and was successively aboard the 74-gun , the 28-gun in the West Indies, the 74-gun and the 36-gun . By 1794 he was serving aboard the 74-gun at the capture of Corsica, though he later moved to serve as a midshipman aboard the 98-gun . While with Princess Royal he saw action at the first of engagements fought under Vice-Admiral, and later Admiral, Sir William Hotham. The first was the Battle of Genoa on 14 March 1795, in which Princess Royal flew the flag of Vice-Admiral Samuel Goodall and sustained casualties of four killed and eight wounded. For the second action, the Battle of Hyères Islands on 13 July 1795, Heathcote was a master's mate aboard the 28-gun , commanded by Admiral Hotham's nephew, William Hotham. Heathcote was finally confirmed as a lieutenant on 19 September 1795, and appointed to the 100-gun . In June 1797 he was appointed as acting-commander of the 20-gun storeship , still in the Mediterranean. He was given a further acting command on 7 November 1797, that of the 36-gun , with orders to take her back to Britain for paying off. He arrived back in Britain in early 1798, and was promoted to post-captain on 5 February 1798. His promotion apparently brought about a break in his service, as he is not recorded commanding another ship until 1803, after the resumption of the wars with France. Napoleonic Wars Heathcote was appointed to command the 32-gun on 4 April 1803, and on 8 July she sailed to take up position as guardship off The Needles. In February 1804 Galatea sailed to the West Indies as escort to a convoy of 150 merchant vessels. He had some success against privateers in the West Indies, until 14 August, when he made an attempt to cut out the French privateer Général Ernouf, the former British sloop-of-war Lily. She was sheltering at the Saintes near Guadeloupe where shore batteries could protect her. Heathcote had been too obvious in his reconnoitering and the French were waiting for the night attack. In all, the British lost some 10 men killed, including Lieutenant Charles Hayman, the commander of the boarding party and first lieutenant of Galatea, and 55 or more wounded or captured. The French lost four killed and suffered some wounded, among them Captain Lapointe, commander of the Général Ernouf, and Lieutenant Mouret, commander of the detachment of troops the French stationed aboard her in anticipation of the attack. The French also captured Galateas barge, which the other three boats of the cutting out party could not retrieve as they made their escape. Heathcote remained in the West Indies until April 1805, when he took command of the 36-gun and sailed her back to Britain escorting a convoy of 101 ships, afterwards paying her off. He was appointed to command the Isle of Wight Sea Fencibles on 21 March 1807, and received his next sea-going command in February 1808, when he took over the 64-gun . He made two voyages to India, carrying Gore Ouseley and Mirza Abolhassan Khan Ilchi, the ambassadors between Persia and Britain. They would be instrumental in arranging for Heathcote's knighthood in 1819. Heathcote then sailed to the East Indies in July 1810 and served at the capture of Java in 1811. His service here was not without controversy, and on 30 August 1811 he was tried by court-martial for breach of the 27th article of war, for disobeying orders, and for neglect of duty. Court-martial William Robert Broughton, who in 1811 pushed for Heathcote to be court-martialed Vice-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury had placed Heathcote in charge of the defence of the west Indian coast, orders which were confirmed by Commodore William Robert Broughton after Drury's sudden death in March 1811. Broughton subsequently went out with the Java Expedition, and was en route when arrived at Bombay carrying despatches. Aware that with Broughton absent, any important orders that the despatches contained might go unread for some time, Heathcote took the unusual step of opening them. The despatches contained a warning that eighteen French frigates, carrying between 3,000 and 4,000 troops, were expected to be sailing for Java to frustrate the British attempt to capture the island, and that the securing of the island by the British was considered vitally important for the future of British operations in the East Indies. Heathcote decided to leave his station and deliver the despatches to Broughton. Despite Heathcote's motives, Broughton was dissatisfied with his conduct, and requested a court-martial from the commander of the British naval forces, Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford. After examining the evidence, the court determined that the first two charges, that of a breach of the 27th article of war, and of disobeying orders, had been proved. The third charge, that of neglecting his duty by failing to escort a merchant fleet at the request of the Bombay government, was judged not to have been proved, and was dismissed. The board tempered their judgement by acknowledging that the breach of orders arose 'from a zeal for the good of his Majesty's service', and that the orders justified his conduct. Heathcote was therefore acquitted. Mediterranean service Heathcote returned to Britain after this, and on 28 April 1812 was appointed to command the 74-gun with the Mediterranean Fleet. His commander, Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew placed him in charge of the inshore squadron during the blockade of Toulon in Autumn 1813, and on 5 November 1813 he became involved in one of the last clashes with the French Mediterranean Fleet. Strong gales in late October 1813 had forced both the British inshore squadron and the main battlefleet off their stations, and the French commander, Vice-Admiral Maxime Julien Émeriau de Beauverger, decided to make a sortie to exercise his fleet off Cape Sicié. Heathcote, commanding four 74-gun ships, had recently arrived back on station and was observing the French movements. At 11:30 am the wind suddenly changed direction, shifting to the north-west. Concerned about the sudden arrival of the British and unfavourable winds, Émeriau abandoned the exercises and ordered the fleet to make for Toulon. The advanced squadron of the French fleet, commanded by Rear-Admiral Julien Cosmao-Kerjulien and consisting of five ships of the line and four heavy frigates, now found itself to leeward, beating back to port. Heathcote immediately saw a chance to cut off the French rear, and ordered his squadron to attack. The Blockade of Toulon, 1810-14: Pellew's Action, 5 November 1813, Thomas Luny, 1830 Heathcote took his ship in and at 12:34 pm passed the French rear, firing on them with her port guns, as the French stood in for Toulon on the starboard tack. The rest of the squadron, joined by the 74-gun from Pellew's fleet, followed in succession. The British ships then turned about and tacked across in the opposite direction, cannonading the fleeing French with their starboard batteries. At 1:00 pm the advance ships of Pellew's fleet, , and arrived and opened fire on the rear-most French ship, the Wagram. The British ships tacked and wore, exchanging fire with the French until the wind carried Cosmao-Kerjulien's squadron under the safety of the shore batteries covering the approach to Toulon. Casualties were light throughout both fleets, the only fatality during the action occurred aboard Heathcote's ship, when a seaman was killed in an accident. The only other casualty aboard Scipion was one man wounded by enemy fire. With the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition, Heathcote was sent to Marseilles with four ships of the line, to collect British prisoners of war from the port and convey them to Port Mahon. Family and later life Heathcote paid off Scipion in October 1814 and had no further active seagoing service. He received a knighthood on 20 July 1819 and was promoted to rear- admiral in 1825. Further promotions followed, he was advanced to vice-admiral in 1837, and to a full admiral in 1846. He had married Sarah-Elizabeth Guscott on 10 November 1799. She predeceased him, dying on 19 October 1845. By this time the couple had produced a large family. Their eldest child, Sarah-Frances Heathcote married Major-General Henry Somerset. Their third son, Thomas Hamilton Heathcote, entered service with the East India Company, and died a lieutenant at Bombay in 1824 at the age of 20. The couple had eleven children in total, at least one of whom followed his father into the navy. In his retirement Heathcote devised improvements in the arrangement of staysails, taking out a patent in 1823, and publishing his theory in a treatise in 1824 entitled Treatise on Stay-Sails, For the Purpose of Intercepting Wind Between the Square-Sails of Ships and Other Square-Rigged Vessels, Mathematically Demonstrating the Superiority of the Improved Patent Stay-Sails, Recently Invented by Captain Sir Henry Heathcote. The work was reviewed by The Naval and Military Magazine, which came to the opinion that \\"However elaborate the diagrams, practical proofs must always be preferred on professional points; and, though the baronet is backed by Euclid, and assures his readers he is supported in his theory by the opinions of experienced officers, it is not too much here to assert, that the majority of both the new and old school will dispute the utility of staysails, in any shape, set 'upon a wind;' and few, it is presumed, will approve of the cut of Sir Henry's jib.\\" Despite this, Heathcote's obituary reported that 'the plan was tried aboard two frigates, and was reported by the Admiralty of being worthy of its acceptance.' Admiral Sir Henry Heathcote died at Ingouville, France on 16 August 1851, at the age of 74. See also *  Notes  a.

Personal life and career Ognev was born in Moscow, Soviet Union in 1969. In 1986 he finished the “special school” No. 38 in Moscow, where several subjects were taught in English. In 1987 Ognev was conscripted to serve in the Soviet Army, where he spent two years. In 1998 he graduated from the Moscow State University majoring in the history of Russian philosophy. In 2000 Ognev became co-founder of InoSMI under the auspices of Strana.ru, an online resource organised as part of Vladimir Putin’s electoral campaign. In 2002 the website was transferred to VGTRK and on 20 February 2004 was further passed on to RIA Novosti. Ognev continued to be editor-in-chief of inoSMI until February 2009. Since February 2009 Ognev is editor of the governmental Voice of Russia radio station’s Internet service. Controversies During his stint as the editor-in-chief of InoSMI Ognev kept low profile most of the time, which fed suspicions about the character of his relations with the Russian authorities and special services, especially in the light of the perceived “anti-Western” nature of InoSMI (according to media analyst Evgeny Morozov, the website “selectively translates foreign press into Russian often projecting an image of extremely hostile, biased, and incompetent Western press” The Kremlin's quest for Pravda 2.0 The InoSMI forum In late 2003 InoSMI launched its forum which became Russia’s first web forum to freely discuss translations from foreign media. Between October 2004 and April 2005 the forum did not function. When reopened, it became the most recognizable part of InoSMI. In one of his interviews, Ognev admitted it was the portal’s “soul”, almost more important that its “face” (the content).Мы принимаем экзамен на зрелость у «свободных и демократических» зарубежных СМИ: интервью Ярослава Огнева (in Russian) The forum community that after Ognev’s dismissal moved to InoForum widely believed their anti-Western opinions were the reason why Ognev was replaced by Marina Pustilnik seen as more “liberal”. The 2005 Tygodnik Powszechny controversy In March 2005, following the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, InoSMI translated an article by Marian Kałuski originally published in several Polish websites, including the forum of Tygodnik Powszechny.Porozmawiajmy szczerze o Ukrainie, czyli o nową politykę polską wobec Ukrainy (in Polish) Kałuski criticized the Polish authorities for rapprochement with Ukraine, arguing it was caused by US pressure. As Tygodnik Powszechny was known for its ardent support for the Orange Revolution, this publication caused an influx of visitors, which was interpreted as a DDos attack.Operation \\"Disinformation\\" Various experts opined it was an operation of Russian special services to test their cyberwar capabilities.Хакерская атака The 2009 dismissal Ognev’s dismissal as editor-in-chief of InoSMI sent shockwaves across Runet. According to Morozov, \\"what used to be one of the most popular news sites on the Russian internet quickly disintegrated, with the most aggressive fans of the Ognev empire even launching DDOS attacks on their favorite site\\".The Kremlin's quest for Pravda 2.0 Some believed that was caused by inconsistency of opinions expressed on the forum with the burgeoning reset in US-Russian relations. Nationalist media argued that the arrival of US-educated Marina Pustilnik was a victory of “liberals” in Russia’s top echelons of power over “patriots”. Anatoly Wasserman, a cult figure for Russia’s Internet generation said Ognev’s dismissal was “the murder of InoSMI”.Убийство ИноСМИ (in Russian) Meanwhile, Ognev said in his blog that his dismissal had been absolutely voluntary.Заявление Ярослава Огнева (in Russian) In the Voice of Russia On 1 June 2009 Ognev was appointed Internet broadcasting editor of the Voice of Russia radio station that had been previously known as Radio Moscow and served as an external propaganda tool for the USSR.

The Cap Rouge region followed the western coast of Cape Breton Island, extending about seven miles to the north of Chéticamp. It included La Bloque, Ruisseau des Maurice (Trout Brook), Rivière à Lazare (Corney Brook) and Ruisseau du Canadien. Today however, the name Cap-Rouge is used to refer to all Acadian communities expropriated for the creation of the National Park, including the Rigouèche, the Buttereau, the Presqu’île and the Source de la Montain.  History  Cap-Rouge, circa 1900 Some of the earliest grants of land in Cap-Rouge were made starting in 1826, with later grants following in 1864, 1867, 1868, and 1869. Other land concessions were awarded between 1873 and 1906. The first school was opened in La Presqu'île around 1877 before later being located higher on the mountain in 1904. A Post Office was established June 1, 1899 at the home of Vieux Maurice Aucoin who become the first Postmaster. Two lobster factories had already been established between 1900 and 1925. By 1936 the Cap-Rouge region included a sawmill located in La Rigoueche, a general store, a wharf, post office and school. Expropriation The village properties were expropriated and the residents evacuated between 1936 and 1939 during the foundation of Cape Breton Highlands National Park, this despite the fact that many Scottish and English villages such as Pleasant Bay, and Ingonish were preserved. In the summer of 1940, on July 7, the Cap-Rouge post office was officially closed. Hiking Trail The former village site is accessible today, by following a Parks Canada maintained trail, \\"Le vieux chemin du Cap-Rouge\\", located on the Cabot Trail across from the Trout Brook picnic area.

It is predicted to behave like other proteins in the p47-GTPase-like and IRG families. It is most expressed in the testis.  Gene  NCBI IRGC gene location on chromosome, includes nearby genes. IRGC is located on chromosome 19 at position 19q13.31 and contains two exons. It is on the forward strand and is upstream of Phospholipase A2 Inhibitor and Ly6/PLAUR Domain-Containing Protein-Like (LOC105372412) and downstream of Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay Factor (SMG9).  Homology and Evolution   Paralog  There is one paralog for IRGC named IRGM. IRGM, or immunity related GTPase M, is associated with intracellular defense. Both are part of the p47-GTPase-like family and the P-loop NTPase domain superfamily. The paralog has 12% identity to IRGC.  Orthologs  Sample of eukaryotes with orthologous sequences for IRGC, includes sequence identity, estimated date of divergence, and color coded for animal class. IRGC was observed to be conserved in all vertebrates. The GTP/Magnesium and polypeptide binding regions and a transmembrane region are fairly conserved between species.  Evolution  For three genes - IRGC, beta-hemoglobin, and cytochrome c, several distant orthologs of the same type were compared to human sequences for their percent identity. This was plotted and compared to time in millions of years. IRGC is seen to have diverged more rapidly than the other genes. IRGC is predicted to have evolved more rapidly than cytochrome c and β-hemoglobin when comparing the percent identity of the same species for each gene over 500 million years. It is likely that IRGC and IRGM diverged 350 to 375 million years ago.  Transcription   Promoter  There was one promoter region, GXP_311825, found for IRGC on chromosome 19. It is 1521 base pairs long and starts at base pair 43714694. It is conserved on all 7 orthologous sequences tested and has the most association with testis, at 8.090 tpm. Of the six potential transcripts, GXT_26231691 had the most CAGE tags. Testis was labeled on 839 of 873 CAGE tags.  mRNA  The most common transcript for IRGC is 1596 base pairs long and has the accession number NM_019612. Other transcripts include isoform X1, XM_005259058, isoform X2, XM_011527118, and isoform X3, XM_006723283.  Protein   Biochemistry  Interferon-inducible GTPase 5 is 463 amino acids long, has a molecular weight of 50.3 kDa, and a predicted isoelectric point of 5.22. It is unlikely to have a signal peptide. A transmembrane region is highly predicted between residues 364 and 384, with the first section of the sequence outside of the membrane and the second section within the membrane.  Secondary Structure  The secondary structure of the protein is expected to have more alpha helices than beta sheets, Close orthologs were observed to have highly similar secondary structures.  Tertiary Structure  NCBI X-ray crystallography structure for ITQD_A, Chain A for Interferon- inducible GTPase found in mice. It is predicted to be similar in structure to interferon-inducible GTPase 5. The tertiary structure can be predicted with related X-ray crystallography structures. There was one hit for the protein, ligp1 [Mus musculus], which had an E-value of 2E-76 and an 34% identity over 82% of the protein sequence.  Post-Translational Modifications  The protein is expected to be GTP and magnesium binding as it contains several related binding sites. It also has predicted homodimer interface regions for polypeptide binding between residues 153 and 163. There are two likely phosphine interaction sites at Ser247 and Ser304. Phosphorylation is expected to be common on serines and a few threonines throughout the sequence, though more are likely after residue 330. A few glyosylation and glycation sites are predicted, though some of the predictions overlap with potential phosphorylation sites.  Subcellular Location  The protein may be non- cytoplasmic though further localization is unknown at this time.  Clinical Significance   Expression  Interferon-inducible GTPase 5 is most highly expressed in the testis. The use of two antibodies (HPA046769 and HPA060064) demonstrated higher expression in elongated spermatids than round spermatids. Leydig cells, spermatogonia, and preleptotene spermatocytes were reported to have low expression. There was low to medium expression observed with both antibodies in the duodenum, small intestine, appendix, and kidney. There may be some expression in myocytes and the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands.  Pathology  Expression has been observed to decrease under cancer conditions. There is unknown clinical association with transcript variations both in the 3' and 5' UTR and within the coding region.

Zero-energy housing requires a very low amount of energy to provide the daily needs and functions for the family occupying the home.\\"Energy Performance of Buildings Directive\\", Zero Carbon Hub, April 2011, Retrieved 2011-12-14 The term carbon footprint, at present, does not have a concrete and universal definition. Thomas Wiedmann proposed a well received and generally accepted definition that defines carbon footprint as a measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions directly and indirectly caused by an activity or accumulated over the life stages of a product. A carbon footprint can be divided into 4 levels: personal, product, organizational, and country. A personal carbon footprint is a measure of greenhouse gas emissions that are a result of daily life. Examples of contributors to personal carbon footprint are clothing, food, housing, and traffic. The emissions from the entire life of a product, extraction of raw materials and manufacturing, and recycling or disposal contribute to product carbon footprint. Greenhouse gas emissions from energy used in buildings, industrial processes, and company vehicles account for organizational carbon footprints. An entire country collectively generates a carbon footprint from carbon dioxide emissions generated by the consumption of materials and energy, vegetations and other carbon sequestrations, as well as the indirect and direct emissions caused by import and export activities. Zero carbon housing is a result of the building sector being one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas. The calculation of the carbon footprint becomes detailed when considering secondary factors. Secondary factors involve the home’s occupant lifestyle such as diet, foods are consumed (example organic vs. non organic), frequency of yearly air travel, commuting mileage to and from work, school, etc., use of public transportation, and number, type, and use of private vehicles. Secondary factors also include fashion or type of clothes purchased and worn, frequency of recycling, recreational activities and use of financial and other services throughout a given year. The frequency of airline flights in a year is considered due to the amount of fuel consumption and other energy usage and emissions generated by one flight. A person that travels frequently may have a significantly bigger carbon footprint than someone who flies once a year for a vacation.\\"Carbon Footprint Calculator\\", Carbon Footprint, Retrieved 2011-12-15 The emissions for an individual flight are calculated by using the greater circle method. First, the distance between airports is determined. Then calculations are completed to account for indirect distances and by an emissions factor in relation to the type of flight (international or a short flight, and what class seating the person is in).\\"Help and Information for the Carbon Footprint Calculators\\", Carbon Footprint, Retrieved 2011-12-15 Another contributing factor to a person’s carbon footprint is their personal vehicle which includes the type of car driven, the efficiency or miles per gallon (MPG) rating, and the number of miles driven each year. The frequency of public transportation used by an individual, miles traveled on public transportation and the type of public transportation used such as bus, train, or subway contributes to their carbon footprint as well. Other factors, as trivial as they might seem, are included in the calculation of a person’s carbon foot print to include things such as the type of diet. A vegetarian compared to a person that eats a lot of red meat will have a lower carbon footprint. All factors being the same except diet, a vegetarian secondary carbon footprint averages three metric tonnes of CO2, one tonne less than the individual who consumes meat.Carbon Footprint Calculator\\", Carbon Footprint, Retrieved 2011-12-15 Other factors include the purchase of local and /or organically grown produce vs. imported items, the latest clothes fashions vs. more conventional purchases, buying individually packaged products vs. buying in bulk, recycling activities, and the types of recreation such as carbon-free activities like hiking and cycling or carbon-intensive activities like skydiving or boating.  Determining a zero-carbon home  * Energy efficiency: Homes have to be energy efficient and minimize the energy demand that is generated daily from a home. New homes will be required to have sufficient insulation installed and be \\"adequately airtight.\\" The installation of 180mm (or more depending on climate) thick insulation, recycling of gray water, replacement of appliances with an energy efficiency rating of \\"A\\" and insulation of hot water heaters all contribute to qualifying the degree of energy efficiency. * Carbon compliance: The onsite contribution to zero carbon includes low onsite carbon usage and zero carbon energy such as a community heating network. A community heating network or \\"district heating\\" is a system that distributes heat for residential and commercial water and space heating needs usually from a central location. This dramatically reduces the carbon footprint of individual homes. Which type of heating fuel/system used further impacts on the carbon footprint. * Allowable measures: Any type of approved carbon-saving measures that could be used on homes consisting of on-site, near-site, and off-site options. On-site options include installation of smart appliances, use of grid-injected bio-methane, installation of site-based heat storage, etc. Near-site options include local micro-hydro schemes, communal waste management solutions, and local energy storage solutions. Off-site options include the investment in plants that turn waste into energy, investment of renovating with low carbon technologies, and investment of low carbon cooling, etc.\\"Allowable Solutions for Tomorrow’s New Homes\\", Zero Carbon Hub, July 2011, http://www.zerocarbonhub.org/definition.aspx?page=4, Retrieved 2011-12-14 Other alternative solutions include the development of alternative projects such as reforestation, solar, hydro, and wind power. This is known as carbon offsetting. These projects are considered carbon offsetting because they either prevent the burning of fossil fuels (solar, hydro, wind) or they utilize CO2 from the atmosphere (reforestation) resulting in offsetting the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere by conventional fossil fuel burning methods. Various private entities and government agencies are beginning to promote the concepts of zero-carbon homes and zero-carbon footprints. In the United Kingdom the Zero Carbon Hub helped the building of zero-carbon housing become a more common practice. The Zero Carbon Hub existed from the summer of 2008 until 31 March 2016 when the government closed it. The Zero Carbon Hub was a public/private partnership working together with the private industry and the government to help reach the government’s energy consumption reduction goals set by the European Union under the Kyoto Protocol of 1997.\\"Energy performance of Buildings Directive\\", Zero Carbon Hub, April 2011, Retrieved 2011-12-14 In the European Union, buildings are responsible for 40% of the total amount of energy needed by the European Union.

Developed by Mike Reynolds, the Earthship is an environmentally friendly 100% sustainable type of home that can be built anywhere and in fact have been constructed all over the world. They are constructed with materials that would normally be discarded to take up space in a landfill including old tires, bottles, and cans.\\"About Earthships\\", The Halfmoon Earthship, Retrieved 2011-12-15 Reynolds has three requirements for Earthships. One, a sustainable architecture using natural (non-manmade) materials as well as recycled materials is utilized. Second, dependency on natural energy sources only (\\"Off-the-grid\\") and third, be financially feasible and a do-it-yourself concept so an average person could build their own Earthship. Reynolds’s design was fairly simple. A southward- facing slope is used and partially excavated to nestle the back of the house into the earth and provide a thermal mass along with usage of discarded tires and earth for the walls. The tires are packed with dirt to make a very dense- like brick. These \\"tire bricks\\" are strong enough to support the load of a roof structure and also very resistant to fire. Recycled cans and bottles are used as filler in the walls, sometimes with the bottles placed strategically to give an inlay glass tile look. Earthships use water four times before it is discarded. There are cisterns at roof level to collect rain water or snow melt. The cistern for a given Earthship is sized to the local climate. From the cistern the water is fed into a water-organizing module with a pump and filtering device. The water is pumped into a pressurized tank to meet the building code of required water pressure. This water is used for bathing, drinking, and activities like washing dishes. The water from these activities that is discarded is known as \\"gray water\\" and is used in the flushing of the toilets. \\"Gray water\\" is not sanitary for drinking but used for other uses in the Earthship. The gray water passes through a grease filter and then into an interior botanical cell. A botanical cell is an indoor garden with growing vegetation. Oxygenation, transpiration, filtration, and bacteria cleansing all take place in the closed cell which cleans and filters the water.Reynolds, Mike. (2000). Comfort In Any Climate, Taos: Solar Survival P. After the botanical cell the process of filtering the \\"gray water\\" is complete and the water is used to flush the toilets. The state the water is in after being used in the toilet is known as \\"black water\\". \\"Black water\\" is not reused inside the Earthship but is transferred to a solar-enhanced septic tank with leach fields and used for watering of exterior botanical cells (landscape plantings). Earthships also have the capacity to process the wastes (generated daily by a household) in the interior and exterior of the Earthship. The exterior botanical cells reduce the waste volume leaching into the ground and reduce the risk of contaminating an aquifer. This system eliminates the use of large public sewer systems and treatment facilities that sometimes cannot adequately treat. The reuse of gray water to produce food allows the Earthships to take sustainability to the next level.Reynolds, Mike. (2000). Comfort In Any Climate, Taos: Solar Survival P. The design of the Earthship structure into the side of a slope allows for maintaining a relatively constant climate inside the home with minimal energy usage. The earthen walls act as a thermal mass soaking up heat during the day and radiating heat into the interior at night. The heat is stored in the mass from the earth walls - when there is no more heat the stored heat radiates to the colder space. This allows the temperature of the inside of the house to stay stable throughout the day and night. Conversely, in warmer ambient temperatures, the earth- bermed house maintains a comfortable indoor temperature assisted by the relatively stable core temperature of the earth. Earthships can live \\"off the grid\\" meaning they can produce their own electricity instead of having to rely on the current infrastructure for power. A power system that consists of photovoltaic cells and a wind power unit supply the Earthship with enough power for the daily actions/usage within a given household. The power from the wind and the solar system is stored in several deep-cycle batteries that deliver the power to the outlets as well as all of the appliances.  The Citu Home  Citu, a company working to accelerate the transition to zero carbon cities, has developed a zero-emission home in partnership with Leeds Beckett University, in part funded by Innovate UK.Leeds Beckett University KTP Retrieved 2018-01-31 With the goal of creating a system able to be produced at scale to allow mass adoption, the Citu Home is built in a factory from timber- framed panels. The factory is located in the 'Climate Innovation District', an area on the outskirts of Leeds City Centre where 500 zero emission Citu Homes will be built. The Citu Home was developed using Passive House tools to create a building so efficient that its heating needs will be on average ten times lower than a conventional house. The home does not have a gas boiler, instead it uses a MVHR system to recycle heat from people and appliances. This means the home's small heating requirements can be satisfied entirely with renewable energy. Citu supply all Citu Homes with 100% renewable energy via Good Energy, one of the UK's leading renewable electricity suppliers. The homes timber framed design allows it to sequester several tonnes of CO2 in the building's structure, whilst the fact it is powered by 100% renewable energy for all its energy needs (including heating) means people living in it can expect to reduce their carbon footprint by over two tonnes of CO2 per year, as the average UK household emits 2.3 tonnes of CO2 heating their home.Commission on Climate Change UK Household Energy Consumption Retrieved 2018-01-31  Role in environmental governance  Zero Carbon Homes and Earthships can play a considerable role in environmental governance. These structures are capable of serving the same everyday functions of a home against changing environmental conditions and are a form of engineering resilience. Engineering resilience is a part of adaptive governance. Adaptive governance is the idea that sustainability can be achieved by adapting to changes instead of changing something completely.J.P. Evans, Environmental Governance, (Abingdon: Routledge, 2012), 172-174. Zero Carbon homes allow humans to adapt to the increasing global temperature. These types of homes make it possible for people to survive without the use of declining levels of fossil fuels, protects the inhabitants from food shortages, and water contamination. Zero carbon homes can provide resilience to the changes from the upset of a tipping point in dynamic stability. In this case \\"tipping point\\" represents the dangerous aspects of climate change. When a tipping point occurs the system would be subjected to a new domain of stability and the characteristics of stability will have changed. The system will have entered into a new \\"domain of attraction\\" and the system will be attracted to a new resting place. In the idea of this, the height of the valley that the \\"domain of attraction\\" is in determines the amount of stress or disturbances needed to force the system into another valley or \\"domain of attraction\\".J.P. Evans, Environmental Governance, (Abingdon: Routledge, 2012), 172-174. Zero carbon homes provide engineering resilience to this event because they will be able to cope with the disturbances that occur. Exactly when these \\"tipping points\\" are going to occur is almost impossible to know and difficult to predict. They represent non-linear change, making it difficult to predict or prepare for.J.P. Evans, Environmental Governance, (Abingdon: Routledge, 2012), 172-174. Possible complications ·Affordability: The Net Zero home, though affordable in the long run, may be quite an investment in the beginning. Much of the equipment used in the production of Net Zero housing is expensive. Aside from the solar panels which are an investment of their own, consumers have often settled for less square footage in an attempt to balance out the overall expenses.“What Are Zero Energy Homes?” Zero Energy Project, zeroenergyproject.org/buy/zero- energy-homes/. As far as implementing Net Zero building on a large scale goes, funding will become an issue as building size increases due to cost. ·Energy Production: One of the most important factors in the construction a Net Zero structure is the amount of energy it will save in comparison to the previous structure. Any Net Zero building needs to be able to function at the same capacity at which it had prior to the retrofitting. This means that each structure will need to produce enough energy to sustain itself or else it will be pulling energy from the general grid. Net Zero homes are most commonly fitted with solar panels as the main energy production source on the roof of the structure. This means that as the height of a certain structure increases, the surface area on the roof becomes smaller in comparison to the overall volume of the structure.Malin, Nadav. “The Problem with Net-Zero Buildings (and the Case for Net-Zero Neighborhoods).” BuildingGreen, BuildingGreen, 30 Apr. 2016, www.buildinggreen.com/feature/problem-net-zero-buildings-and-case- net- zero-neighborhoods. Complications concerning energy production will arise due to the fact that there will not be enough space for solar panels to meet the consumption needs of the structure. ·Predictability in Relation to Surrounding Environment: As the concept of Net Zero building spreads throughout the world, problems with energy production are becoming present aside from size of the structure. The region in which a certain Net Zero home is built in directly effects its energy production. Complications appear amongst the rural community due to the fact that rural areas are often heavily wooded. In order for a solar panel to function to its full potential, it requires direct sunlight for as many hours out of the day as possible.

Life and career İsmail Zühdi was born in Unye on the Black Sea. His father, Mehmed Kaptan, took him to Istanbul at a young age to learn the Q'ran.Uğur Derman, M. Letters in Gold: Ottoman Calligraphy from the Sakıp Sabancı Collection, Istanbul, pp. 19, 96-98 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998). He is also known as Yeni İsmail Zühdi, or İsmail Zühdi the Second, to distinguish him from another calligrapher by the same name who lived in an earlier period.Uğur Derman, M., \\"İsmail Zühdi, Yeni\\", [Biography], Islam Encyclopedia, Online: İsmail Zühdi had a much younger brother, Mustafa Râkim, who also became a calligrapher.Mülayim, Selçuk and Akşit, İlhan. Turkish Art and Architecture in Anatolia & Mimar Sinan, p. 260 (Akşit, 2005). When Mustafa was still quite young, their father took the boy to Istanbul to live with İsmail and study calligraphy with him. By that time, İsmail had been appointed as an instructor of calligraphy at the Imperial Palace, which is where the young Mustafa Râkim received his formal training, studying under his brother. Ismail Zuhdi wrote in a firm and masterful way. Huart, C., Les Calligraphes et les Miniaturistes de l'Orient Musulman 1972, p. 188 Digital copy (in French) The two brothers, Ismail Zuhidi and Mustafa Râkim, went on to develop their own style of calligraphy based on the work of Hâfiz Osman. They were able to develop a style of celi sülüs that was aesthetically pleasing, something that other calligraphers had not been able to do. His younger brother, Mustafa Râkim, also perfected the tughra and went on to perfect other scripts, becoming İsmail Zühdi's most celebrated pupil. Ottoman calligraphy at Eyüp Sultan MosqueSome forty Q’rans copied by him have survived. He also left many writing boards, ki'tas and muraqqas. The inscriptions of the mausoleum of Châh-Sultane at the Deftèrdâr of Eyyoub are by him as is the inscription placed above the door of this same mausoleum is from Mouçtafa 'Izzèt Yasâri. He died in 1806 and was buried outside the gate of Adrianople, at the Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery. His brother Mustafa wrote his epitaph. Mustafa postponed his major calligraphic innovations until İsmail died, in deference to seniority.

The war was initially fought between Nepalese Gorkhas and Tibetan Tamang armies over a trade dispute related to a long-standing problem of low-quality coins manufactured by Nepal for Tibet. The Nepalese Army under Bahadur Shah plundered Tibet under Qing rule and Tibetans tamangs signed the Treaty of Kerung paying annual tribute to Nepal. However, Tibetans requested for Chinese intervention and Sino-Tibetan forces under Fuk'anggan raided Nepal up to Nuwakot only to face strong Nepalese counterattack. Thus, both countries signed the Treaty of Betrawati as a stalemate. The war ended in Nepal accepting as tribute state of Qing (Nepal maintains diplomacy and pays tribute). Nepal paid tribute to China in 1792, 1794, 1795, 1823, 1842, and 1865.Gundry, Background Tibet had been using Nepalese silver coins since the time of the Malla kings. When Prithvi Narayan Shah of the Gorkha Kingdom launched an economic blockade on the Kathmandu Valley during his unification campaign, Jaya Prakash Malla of Kathmandu faced an economic crisis which he tried to alleviate by minting low quality coins mixed with copper. After Prithvi Narayan Shah successfully conquered the Kathmandu Valley in 1769 and firmly established the rule of the Shah dynasty in Nepal, he reverted to minting pure silver coins. But by then the damage to the confidence of the Nepalese minted coins had already been done. The Tibetans demanded that all the impure coins in circulation be replaced by pure silver ones, a demand that would place a huge financial burden on the newly founded Shah dynasty. Prithvi Narayan Shah was not willing to bear such a huge loss in a matter for which he was not responsible, but was willing to vouch for the purity of the newly minted coins. Thus two kinds of coins were in circulation in the market. The case remained unresolved due to his untimely demise in 1775, and the problem was inherited by successive rulers of Nepal. By 1788 Bahadur Shah, the youngest son of Prithivi Narayan Shah, and the uncle and regent of the minor king Rana Bahadur Shah, had inherited an aggravated coinage problem. On the plea of debased coins, Tibet had started to spread rumors that it was in a position to attack Nepal; and the Nepalese merchants in Tibet were likewise harassed. Another sore point in Nepal-Tibet relationship was Nepal’s decision to provide refuge to the 10th Shamarpa Lama, Mipam Chödrup Gyamtso, and his fourteen Tibetan followers. He had fled from Tibet to Nepal on religious and political grounds. Yet another cause for conflict was the low quality of salt being provided by Tibetans to Nepal, since in those days, all the salt in Nepal came from Tibet. A Nepalese delegation was sent to Tibet to resolve these issues, but the demands made by the Nepalese were rejected by the Tibetans. The Nepalese found the quarrel over coinage a good pretext to expand their kingdom and to raid the rich monasteries in Tibet. Thus, Nepal launched multi-directional attacks on Tibet. First Invasion Kazi Damodar Pande, who led war with Tibetans that resulted in the Treaty of Kerung In the year 1788, Bahadur Shah sent Gorkha troops under the joint command of Damodar Pande and Bam Shah to attack Tibet. The Gorkha troops entered Tibet through Kuti (Nyalam Town) and reached as far as Tashilhunpo (about 410 km. from Kuti). A fierce battle was fought at Shikarjong in which the Tibetans were badly defeated. The Panchen Lama and Sakya Lama then requested the Gorkha troops to have peace talks. So the Gorkha troops left Shikarjong and went towards Kuti and Kerung (Gyirong). Territorial Expansions up to Shigatse/Digarcha When the Qianlong Emperor of China heard the news of the invasion of Tibet by Nepal, he sent a large troop of the Chinese army under the command of General Chanchu. Chanchu came to know the situation from the Tibetan Lamas. He decided to stay in Tibet till the dispute was settled. The representatives of Tibet and Nepal met at Khiru in 1789 to have peace talks. In the talks Tibet was held responsible for the quarrel and were required to give compensation to Nepal for the losses incurred in the war. Tibet had also to pay tribute to Nepal a sum of Rs. 50,001 every year in return for giving back to Tibet all the territories acquired during the war. It was called the Treaty of Kerung. The Nepalese representatives were given Rs. 50,001 as the first installment. So giving back the territories - Kerung, Kuti, Longa, Jhunga and Falak, they went back to Nepal. But Tibet refused to pay the tributes after the first year of the conclusion of the treaty. As a result, the war between Nepal and Tibet continued. Second Invasion As Tibet had refused to pay the tribute to Nepal, Bahadur Shah sent a troop under Abhiman Singh Basnet to Kerung and another troop under the command of Damodar Pande to Kuti in 1791. Damodar Pande attacked Digarcha and captured the property of the monastery there. He also arrested the minister of Lhasa, Dhoren Kazi (Tib. Rdo ring Bstan 'dzin dpal 'byor, b.1760) and came back to Nepal. As soon as this news was heard by the Qianlong Emperor, he sent a strong troop of 70,000 soldiers under the leadership of Fuk'anggan to defend Tibet. Thus in the year 1792 the Nepal - Tibet war turned into a war between Nepal and the Qing empire. The Qing Empire asked Nepal to return the property to Tibet which was looted at Digarcha. They also demanded them to give back Shamarpa Lama who had taken asylum in Nepal. But Nepal turned a deaf ear to these demands. The Qing imperial army responded to Nepal with military intervention. The Qing forces marched along the banks of the Trishuli River until they reached Nuwakot. The Nepalese troops attempted to defend against the Qing attack, but were already faced with overwhelming odds. Heavy damage was inflicted on both sides and the Chinese army pushed the Gurkhas back to the inner hills close to the Nepali capital. However, a comprehensive defeat of the Gorkhali army could not be achieved. At the same time, Nepal was dealing with military confrontations along two other fronts. The nation of Sikkim had begun incursions along Nepal's eastern border. Along the far-western side, the war with Garhwal continuined. Within Nepal's own borders, the kingdoms of Achham, Doti and Jumla openly revolted. Thus the problems that Bahadur Shah faced made it much harder to defend against the Qing army. The anxious Bahadur Shah asked for 10 howitzer mountain guns from the British East India Company. Captain William Kirkpatrick arrived in Kathmandu, but he put conditions of business treaty for delivery of the weapons. Wary of the British interest, weapons were not received and the war situation became critical for Bahadur Shah. After a series of successful battles, the Qing army suffered a major setback when they tried to cross a monsoon-flooded Betrawati, close to a Gorkhali palace in Nuwakot. As the Qing troops had reached south of the Betravati river, near Nuwakot, it was difficult for the Nepalese troops to wait for them at Kathmandu. At Kathmandu, a Nepalese force of less than 200 soldiers attempted to resist the Qing troops at Betravati. On September 19, 1792 Nepalese troops launched a counterattack against the Qing forces encamped at Jitpurfedi. The Nepalese used a tactic where their soldiers carried lit torches in their hands, tying them to the branches of trees, and tying flaming torches on the horns of domestic animals and driving them towards the enemy. The Qing army suffered a defeat, but the loss failed to dislodge them from Nepal. A stalemate ensued, and with their resources low and a looming uncertainty regarding how long they would be able to hold on in addition to the need to continue their expansion drive on the western frontier, the Gorkhalis signed a treaty on terms dictated by the Qing that required, among other obligations, Nepal to send tributes to the Qing emperor every five years. On the 8th day of Bhadra, 10,000 Chinese troops advanced forward from Betrawati river. There were three forts passed the Betrawati river namely; Chokde, Dudethumko, and Gerkhu. At Gerkhu, the commanding officer was Kaji Kirtiman Singh Basnyat and at Chokde, the commanding officer was Kaji Damodar Pande. There were serious fightings around all the three forts and heavy repulse from Nepalese forces compelled Chinese troops to retreat to Betrawati river. At Betrawati bridge, the Chinese General Tung Thyang began to punish retreating Chinese soldiers with severe injuries resulting in their death. Two of the Chinese officers who retreated beyond the Betrawati river were punished with injury to their nose. The action of the Chinese General demotivated the troops and increase rapid desertion and retreat through other routes. Many Chinese troops died falling from hills into river and others from the bullets and arrows from Nepalese side. Around 1000 or 1200 Chinese troops were killed in the manner. The Chinese General Tung Thyang lost all hopes of attacking the Nepalese forces and decided to conclude a treaty with Nepal through his letter. The letter from Tung Thyang reached the government of Nepal. In reply, the government of Nepal issued a royal order deputing Kaji Damodar Pande to conclude a treaty with the Chinese Emperor to prevent further hostility and maintain peace with the Emperor. The royal order issued by King Rana Bahadur Shah to Kaji Damodar Pande on Thursday, Bhadra Sudi 13, 1849 (September 1792) is detailed below: Aftermath The celebration of consolidation of Tibet after the Gurkha Campaign (Nepal) 1792 The Qing general Fuk'anggan then sent a proposal to the Government of Nepal for ratifying a peace treaty. Bahadur Shah also wanted to have cordial relations with the Qing. He readily accepted the proposal and they concluded a friendly treaty at Betravati on 2 October 1792. The terms of the treaty were as follows: # Both Nepal and Tibet will accept the suzerainty of the Qing emperor. # The Government of Tibet will pay the compensation of the property of the Nepalese merchants which were looted by the Tibetans at Lhasa. # The Nepali citizens will have the right to visit, trade, and establish industries in any part of Tibet and China. # In case of any dispute between Nepal and Tibet, the Qing government will intervene and settle the dispute at the request of both the countries. # The Qing will help Nepal defend against any external aggression. # Both Nepal and Tibet will have to send a delegation to pay tribute to the Imperial Court in China every five years. # In return, the Qing emperor will also send friendly gifts to both the countries and the people who carry the tribute will be treated as important guests and will be provided every facility. While Tibet came under greater control of the Qing after the war, Nepal still retained its autonomy. However the weakening of the Qing dynasty during the 19th century led to the disregard of this treaty. For instance, during the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16, when the British East India Company launched an invasion of Nepal, not only did China fail to help her feudatory in that conflict, but it also failed to prevent the cession of Nepalese territory to the British. Similarly, during another Nepalese-Tibetan War of 1855-56, China was conspicuously absent. The Qing were not particularly interested in ruling Nepal; their war was primarily aimed at consolidating their control of Tibet which, in turn, was related to military strategy throughout Central Asia.Peter Perdue, China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia (Cambridge: Belknap Press, 2005).

He began his formal training with Abdullatif Efendi, who was a student of Ak Molla Omer Efendi and Hoca Râsim Efendi. However, following disagreements about style, he abandoned this tuition and was largely self-taught. He applied himself rigorously to an analysis of the works of the great 17th-century calligrapher, Hâfiz Osman.The Beauty of the Pencil [Website] Online: Like his contemporaries, Mustafa Râkim and İsmail Zühdi, Celaleddin worked on improving Arabic scripts. At the time, no artist had been able to achieve a style of sülüs that was aesthetically pleasing. Celaleddin adapted the style of Hâfiz Osman to one better suited to his own tastes. He also developed versions of sülüs and naskh that were strong and confident. The Sultan Abdulmecid had been one of Celaleddin's students and he encouraged the court calligraphers to produce works in Celaladdin's style. However, his style was short-lived because his version of celî sülüs was rigid and static and his scripts were ultimately abandoned in favour of Mustafa Râkim's more dynamic scripts.M.

However, the site of the current county seat was not decided until 1858, and a decision to build a proper courthouse was not made until 1884. The Ontonagon County Courthouse, designed by the architectural firm of Charlton, Gilbert & Demar, was completed in 1886.

Climate Change Act. Decarbonisation of electricity generation will form a major part of this reduction and is essential before other sectors of the economy can be successfully decarbonised.DECC (2011a). Planning Our Electric Future: A White Paper for Secure, Affordable and Low-Carbon Electricity. The Government’s proposals for electricity market reform, published in a White Paper in July 2011, included three initiatives to encourage decarbonisation of electricity generation in the UK: A Carbon Price Floor to complement the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS); Feed-in tariffs which will eventually replace the Renewables Obligation; and an Emissions Performance Standard to restrict future use of the most carbon intensive forms of generation. In implementing these proposals, the Government aims to attract investment in low-carbon generation, deliver security of supply through an appropriate mix of electricity sources and ensure a minimum amount of impact on consumer bills; all this at a time when security of supply is threatened by scheduled closures of existing plants and both the demand for, and subsequently the price of, electricity is increasing.  Proposals for decarbonisation  The Government published Planning Our Electric Future: A White Paper for Secure, Affordable and Low-Carbon Electricity in July 2011. The paper contained three proposals designed to encourage decarbonisation of the UK electricity sector, the rationale behind the introduction and potential impacts of a Carbon Price Floor, Feed-in tariffs and an Emissions Performance Standard are discussed in turn below. Carbon price floor The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is a cap and trade system covering the European electricity generation sector and energy intensive industries. Introduced in 2005, it provides a mechanism through which the European price of carbon can be gradually increased to take into account negative externalities, such as the social and environmental impact of emissions, which would not normally be considered. The inability of the market to reflect the full cost of carbon is known as a market failure. The importance of accounting for the full cost of carbon in investment decisions was highlighted by the influential Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change which found that the cost of taking action to reduce emissions now is much less than the cost to the economy if no action is taken and adaptation is required at a later date.Stern, N., Peters, S., Bakhshi, V., Bowen, A., Cameron, C., Catovsky, S., Crane, D., Cruickshank, S., Dietz, S. and Edmonson, N. (2006) Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change, London: HM Treasury. The EU ETS operates by setting an overall cap on emissions and allocating tradable permits to participants in the scheme. If a participant wishes to emit more than their allocation they must purchase additional permits from a participant who does not require their full allocation. The price of carbon is escalated slowly by reducing the amount of credits in circulation, gradually increasing the incentive for businesses to seek low-carbon alternatives.Evans, J. (2011). Environmental Governance, Routledge, London. Rather than forcing all participants to reduce emissions by a set amount, cap and trade systems allow individual organisations to respond in the most effective way, whether by reducing emissions or buying extra permits, thereby reducing the overall cost of achieving emissions reductions. In practice however, whilst providing certainty over the pace and scale of EU emissions reductions, the EU ETS has failed to raise the price of carbon sufficiently to steer behaviour away from carbon-intensive practices. This failure can be attributed to the presence of a surplus amount of credits in the system, both due to the application of the principle of precedent, whereby free permits were allocated to actors whose business is completely dependent on producing emissions, and a lack of data on actual emissions when the original cap was set. The failures identified are not failures of the cap and trade system itself, rather failures in its implementation. Emissions trading remains the Government’s preferred option for reducing emissions, an approach also supported by the Stern Review. Steps can be taken to improve the effectiveness of the EU ETS, in fact, the presence of surplus credits would start to be addressed from 2013, after which the cap will be tightened each year and the number of credits in the system reduced. However, given that the initial cap appears to have been set too high, the carbon price may remain low, and subject to volatility, for some time after this date until the cap is tightened sufficiently. Due in part to failures in the implementation of the EU ETS and a discrepancy between EU and UK emissions reduction targets, the EU scheme is not consistent with the pace and scale of change required to meet UK decarbonisation targets. As such, the carbon price set by the EU ETS has not been certain or high enough to encourage sufficient investment in low-carbon electricity generation in the UK. The UK Government has therefore identified that additional incentives are required to ensure that progress towards meeting the UK emissions reduction targets continues to be made. Furthermore the measures should be coherent with the EU ETS so that the UK can continue operating within the scheme until an additional incentive is no longer required. The introduction of the Carbon Price Floor is intended to achieve these aims. Setting a Carbon Price Floor will prevent the price of carbon in the UK falling below a target level by topping up the carbon price set by the EU ETS when necessary. The target level chosen by the Government must be high enough to provide a strong signal to investors that low-carbon electricity generation represents a secure, long-term investment. A secondary aim is to encourage a change in dispatch decisions for existing generation, favouring the use of less carbon-intensive generation over more traditional forms when both are available. The carbon price floor is intended to provide greater certainty on future carbon prices, protecting investors in UK low-carbon initiatives from the volatility of the EU carbon price. This has the effect of reducing the amount of risk that investors are exposed to and decreasing the cost of capital for low-carbon investment. In setting the Carbon Floor Price, the Government must achieve a balance between encouraging investments in low- carbon generation without unfairly impacting existing generators, undermining the competitiveness of UK industry or increasing electricity prices unduly. For these reasons, the introduction of a Carbon Floor Price is insufficient on its own to deliver sufficient investment and is supplemented by a proposed change in the support mechanism for low-carbon generation to a form of Feed-in tariff, discussed below.  Feed-in tariff  A Feed-in tariff (FIT) provides a fixed level of income for a low-carbon generator over a specified period of time. There are three main types: a Premium FIT offers a static payment in addition to the revenue gained by selling electricity on the market; a Fixed FIT provides a static payment designed to replace any revenue from selling in the electricity market; and a FIT with a contract for difference (CfD), where a variable payment is made to ensure that the generator receives the agreed tariff assuming they sell their electricity at market price.DECC (2010). Electricity Market Reform Consultation Document. A FIT with CfD is the Government’s preferred choice as it is deemed to be the most cost-effective whilst retaining an appropriate amount of exposure to market forces. The requirement to sell electricity on the market encourages operators to make efficient decisions about dispatch and maintenance given that revenues above the agreed tariff can be achieved if electricity is sold at above the average market price. Contact with the market would be completely removed under a Fixed FIT, potentially leading to sub-optimal operational decisions, and too great under a Premium FIT, over-exposing operators to future electricity price uncertainty. It is proposed that Feed-in tariffs with Contracts for Difference (FIT CfD) will replace the current support mechanism, the Renewables Obligation (RO), in 2017 after running in parallel from 2013. The Renewables Obligation encourages the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources by awarding Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) to generators. Renewables Obligation Certificates provide an additional source of income in that they can be sold to suppliers who are obligated to source an increasing amount of the electricity they provide from renewable energy sources. The Renewables Obligation has been successful in encouraging the development of well established forms of renewable energy such as landfill gas and onshore wind but has been less successful in bringing through less well developed technologies to market competitiveness.Foxon, T.J. and Pearson, P.J.G. (2007). ‘Towards improved policy processes for promoting innovation in renewable electricity technologies in the UK’, Energy Policy, 35(3), 1539-1550. Modelling of future deployment scenarios indicates that a significant contribution would be required from less mature technologies which lacked sufficient incentive to develop into feasible alternatives under the original Renewables Obligation scheme.Wood, G. and Dow, S. (2010). ‘The likely impact of reforming the Renewables Obligation on renewables targets’, International Journal of Energy Sector Management, 4(2), 273-301. The Renewables Obligation also does not apply to nuclear generation. Further criticism of the Renewables Obligation in its original form included uncertainty over the price of a Renewables Obligation Certificate, which varies depending on demand and could reduce significantly if the amount of electricity produced from renewable energy sources approaches the obligation level. The presence of this risk acted as a perverse incentive for the market not to meet the obligation.Mitchell, C., Bauknecht, D. and Connor, P.M. (2006). ‘Effectiveness through risk reduction: a comparison of the renewable obligation in England and Wales and the feed-in system in Germany’, Energy Policy, 34, 297-305. The Renewables Obligation has also been criticised for acting as a barrier to entry for small generators, with only large companies able to overcome the high transaction costs and high investment risks associated with the mechanism.Woodman, B. and Mitchell, C. (2011). ‘Learning from experience? The development of the Renewables Obligation in England and Wales 2002-2010’, Energy Policy, 39(7), 3914-3921. Any reduction in risk would improve access to capital markets which is especially important for small companies who can’t finance projects from their balance sheet alone. Reforms of the Renewables Obligation since its introduction in 2002 have aimed to address these issues. The introduction of banding in 2009 allowed the incentives for renewable energy technologies that are further from market to be increased whilst the amount of support for well established technologies could be reduced to avoid over-subsidisation. The introduction of guaranteed headroom, also in 2009, eliminated the risk of a significant drop in ROC prices by setting the obligation level to ensure that there is always sufficient demand for ROCs. Feed-in tariffs were introduced in 2010 as an alternative to the Renewables Obligation for projects of less than 5MW with the aim of simplifying the process and removing barriers to access for smaller generators. The Renewables Obligation scheme was also extended to alleviate concerns over the finite and limited duration of subsidies. Mitigating some of the risks associated with the support mechanism is an alternative to raising the level of support. Despite the reforms to the Renewables Obligation detailed above, some risks, such as uncertainty over future electricity prices, remained. The introduction of a feed-in tariff to support all low- carbon generation successfully addresses this risk, which should translate into a reduced cost of capital. The introduction of a feed-in tariff is therefore intended to reduce the cost of delivering low-carbon electricity supply. Feed-in tariffs may not be as efficient in the short term but provide long term stability, incentives and resources for efficiency savings allowing tariffs to be reduced in the future. Policy uncertainty can be created due to excessive change in the support mechanism. The Government has taken steps to mitigate this risk by publishing timetables and consulting with industry on the scale and pace of reforms, conducting an impact assessment,DECC (2011b). Electricity Market Reform Impact Assessment. overlapping the introduction of feed-in tariffs with the Renewables Obligation for a period of four years and pledging to continue providing support for existing schemes under the Renewables Obligation. Despite these measures, the introduction of a new incentive scheme runs the risk of triggering a hiatus in investment if investors are unsure about how the scheme will work or uncertain whether it represents a good investment. In addition to reforming the support mechanism, the Government is simultaneously taking steps to address other barriers to deployment, such as delays caused by the planning system and availability of grid connections. The Renewable Energy Roadmap, published by the Government in 2011, identifies the main barriers to deployment and potential deployment levels for each form of renewable energy and details how these barriers will be overcome.DECC (2011c). Renewable Energy Roadmap. Emissions performance standard The decarbonisation incentives provided by the Carbon Price Floor and Feed-In Tariffs are further supplemented by the proposed introduction of an Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) to limit the amount of carbon dioxide that new power stations can emit per kWh of electricity generated. An Emissions Performance Standard is deemed to be required in the event that the market incentives detailed above are not sufficient in themselves to steer the electricity sector away from the most carbon intensive forms of generation. The level at which the EPS is set recognises that fossil fuel generation currently still has an important role to play in ensuring security of supply, providing stable base-load and flexibility, whilst at the same time retaining consistency with decarbonisation objectives by preventing the construction of new coal-fired power stations without carbon capture and storage technology and maintaining affordable electricity prices. The proposed EPS only applies to electricity generation, and is set at a level to balance the delivery of decarbonisation targets against the cost of electricity. Using the argument that decarbonising electricity is key to decarbonising UK energy supplies, many commentators have criticised H.M.Government for not introducing a far more onerous 2030 electricity EPS. This argument is based on the incorrect assumption that gas cannot be decarbonised economically at large scale. Typically methane synthesis produces around 55% CO2 and 45% CH4. Separating these gases into two streams in order to inject Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) into the gas grid leaves high purity, high pressure CO2 as a waste by-product readily available for use for CCS at near zero marginal cost of capture and compression. If 45% biogenic:55%fossil mixed fuel is used to produce SNG with CCS, zero net CO2 emissions are produced. This concept is called Low Carbon Gas (LCG). In USA, it is called Carbon Neutral SNG. The typical marginal abatement cost of carbon for LCG making is around 40 to 50p/tonne supercritical CO2. Gas is a storable primary energy resource, whereas electricity is an instantaneous secondary energy vector. Energy flows from the gas grid, but vice versa. 250 times more energy is stored as gas in UK than as electricity. The capital cost of gas transmission is 1/15th the cost per MWkm of electricity transmission. 5 times more energy flows through the gas grid than the electricity grid at the Winter demand peak. Gas is typically 1/3rd the cost per unit energy of electricity. Carbon negative gas can be produced from mixed wastes, biomass and coal at large scale at a cost of around 45 to 50 p/therm, 1/6th DECC and OFGEM's projected 2030 cost per unit energy of decarbonised electricity of £100/MWh. The technology to produce large quantities of low cost Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) was developed jointly between HM Ministry of Fuel and Power and British Gas Corporation between 1955 and 1992, with a view to supplying the whole of UK gas demand post-2010 when it was foreseen that North Sea gas would run out. Key elements of British Gas SNG technology are currently in use at the World's largest and longest-running SNG plant with Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) at Great Plains in Dakota, and are being developed at industrial scale in China under the current 2010 to 2015 Five Year Plan. A simple modification to the British Gas SNG technology will enable carbon negative SNG to be produces at 60 bar pressure, and high purity supercritical CO2 to be produced at 150 bar pressure, at near zero net loss of energy efficiency, or additional cost. Carbon negative SNG can be used to generate carbon negative electricity at lower cost than incumbent fossil gas or electricity. Given that electricity and gas can both be decarbonised with equal facility, and at nearly equal low costs, there is no need to introduce an onerous EPS with a view to largely 'squeezing' gas fired electricity generation off the grid by 2030. Instead it is proposed that technology neutral equal renewables and decarbonisation targets are introduced for both low carbon gas and electricity, with Contracts for Differences for both low carbon gas and low carbon electricity, the relative 'strike prices' to be set by reference to the historic gas to electricity price ratio. This will spread cost-effective decarbonisation equally over both the gas and electricity grids, and their associated infrastructure. The final enacted version of The Energy Act 2013 included a late amendment: Schedule 4 to Section 57 of the Act. Schedule 4 enables any gasification plant, CCS plant, and any two or more associated power plants, or any part thereof, to be considered as a single system for the determination of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and low carbon electricity generation. The Schedule is silent about what fuel may be used for gasification; how the gasification and CCS plants operate or are inter-connected, and what type of gaseous energy vector flows from the gasification and CCS plants to the two or more power plants, or any part thereof. Typically, gaseous energy vectors used for power generation are: synthesis gas (aka Syngas or Towns Gas - a mixture of CO, CO2, H2 and CH4); Hydrogen (H2), or Methane (aka Natural Gas, Synthetic Natural Gas or biomethane - CH4). Any of the above gas vectors could comply with the terms of Schedule 4. In reality, the only gas transmission network in the UK connecting two or more power plants is the existing UK gas grid. Provided, therefore, that methane injected into the grid has had its anthropogenic carbon emissions offset at source by the use of either biogenic fuels, CCS or a combination of both, such methane will comply with the terms of The Energy Act, and generators burning such gas to produce low carbon electricity will be eligible for support by Contracts for Differences. DECC has confirmed that such a scheme is eligible for support by CfD. As carbon offset methane injected into the high pressure gas transmission grid will be distributed equally to all gas end users: transport, heat, industry and power generators, enhanced revenue earned by CfD supported gas fired power stations can be used to underwrite the decarbonizing of the gas grid.  Summary  In combination, the introduction of a Carbon Price Floor and Feed-In Tariffs would act as two clear economic signals to the market with the aim of encouraging a market response to the challenge of decarbonising the UK electricity generation sector. The Emissions Performance Standard is a regulatory backup designed to complement the incentives for low-carbon generation by preventing further construction of the most carbon-intensive forms of generation. As the need for action to meet the UK’s emissions reduction targets has become more urgent the Government has provided an increased level of steering through both market-based incentives and regulation. The Government has intervened to ensure that market signals provided by the carbon price and incentives for low-carbon generation are strong enough to encourage sufficient investment in decarbonisation. The Government has been reluctant to intervene in the past, preferring instead to defer to market forces, but, as illustrated by the evolution of the Renewables Obligation, the Government has found it increasingly necessary to perform a more strategic role. The requirement for Government intervention does not necessarily mean that markets are unable to deliver the required changes, indeed, market mechanisms remain the preferred option for decarbonising UK electricity supply, just that they must be designed and implemented in such a way that delivers the scale and pace of change required. There is no plan to revert to pre-privatisation ‘Command and Control’ type policy. Instead policy frameworks, market design and regulation are the tools by which the Government seeks to drive investment in energy projects which are considered to be compatible with policy objectives. In other words, the market still decides, but the Government designs the market framework in a way that influences the decision.

The first type is called maintenance rehearsal. A person can do this by saying aloud or thinking of material repeatably until it becomes a part of the working memory. However, the material may fade from the working memory quickly. An example of this is looking up a phone number but forgetting it before being able to dial it into the phone. This is a common form of rote learning. Rote learning is learning or memorization by repetition, often without an understanding of the reasoning or relationships involved in the material that is learned.The American Heritage® Medical Dictionary Copyright © 2007, 2004 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company. However, the material may register eventually and take large amounts of time and hard work. Maintenance rehearsal is viewed in educational psychology as an ineffective way of getting information to the long-term memory. Another type of rehearsal is elaborative rehearsal. This entails connecting new material learned, with already existing long term memories. In this type of rehearsal repetitive tactics are not successful. A strategy such as engaging the brain of the learners in an elaboration exercise will help the memories be more storable and retrievable in the future. Case study In the study of \\"The Effects of Elaboration and Rehearsal on Long-Term Retention of Shape Names by Kindergarteners\\", the two promising instructional paradigms, elaboration and overt rehearsal were put to test. Elaboration strategies include paraphrasing or summarizing the material to be learned, creating analogies, generative note-taking (where the student actually reorganizes and connects ideas in their notes in contrast to passive, linear note-taking), explaining the ideas in the material to be learned to someone else, and question asking and answering.Weinstein & Mayer, 1986 C.E Weinstein and R.E Mayer, The teaching of learning strategies, M Wittrock, Editor, Handbook of research on teaching, Macmillan, New York (1986), pp. 315–327.

The Conservative gain came in Old Town ward, where Ian Lucas took the seat for the party, with the increase in council tax being reported as a major reason for the Conservative gain.

The election, held on 6 May, resulted in the first hung parliament in the UK in 36 years, sparking a series of negotiations which would form the first coalition government since the Second World War. The governing Labour administration led by Gordon Brown was defeated in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office. The opposition Conservatives led by David Cameron won the largest number of seats in the new Parliament, but fell short of the number required to secure an overall majority. Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings with representatives from the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg, aimed at forming a coalition government. As leader of the third largest party, Clegg had announced that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government as part of a rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that Gordon Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal. Although Brown relinquished his role as Labour leader on 10 May, the party failed to reach an agreement with the Liberal Democrats; the latter instead struck a deal with the Conservatives the following day. Brown resigned as Prime Minister on the evening of 11 May, and the Conservative–Liberal Democrat Coalition government led by David Cameron took office shortly thereafter. The Liberal Democrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal Executive to announce that the coalition deal had been \\"approved overwhelmingly\\" shortly after midnight on 12 May, and later the same day the two parties published the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement setting out the terms of their deal. While Cameron became Prime Minister, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister. Background The Labour Party came into government under the leadership of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the party had a working majority of 179 seats, and went on to win the 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, the recapitalisation of the banks lead to a massive rise national debt as the private debt accumulated by the banks became public. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills. Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians. By April 2010 almost five years had passed since the previous general election (held on 5 May 2005), requiring a fresh election to take place. On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April in preparation for a general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May. The time between the announcement of the election and the dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was to allow for the handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion. A graph of YouGov poll results during the 2010 election campaign. Conservatives are shown in blue, Labour in red, Liberal Democrats in yellow and all other parties in grey. Labour campaigned to secure a fourth consecutive term in office and to restore support lost since 1997, while the Conservative Party sought to gain a dominant position in British politics after losses in the 1990s, and to replace Labour as the governing party. The Liberal Democrats hoped to make gains from both sides, and possibly hold the balance of power in a hung parliament. After the televised debates between the three leaders – the first of their type during an election campaign in the United Kingdom – their poll ratings had risen to the point where many considered the possibility of a Liberal Democrat role in Government. While Cameron and Clegg were generally well received by the viewers of the three debates, Brown's performance was considered to have been less successful. Brown's image was further harmed when he privately described Gillian Duffy, a 65-year-old pensioner, as a \\"bigoted woman\\" after she raised the issue of benefits and immigration with him during a campaign trip to Rochdale, Greater Manchester. His remarks were recorded by a Sky News microphone he was still wearing as he was driven away from the visit, and were widely broadcast. Polls just before election day showed a slight swing from the Liberal Democrats back to Labour and the Conservatives, with most of final polls falling within one point of Conservatives 36%, Labour 28%, Liberal Democrats 27%. However, record numbers of undecided voters raised uncertainty about the outcome. The Scottish National Party (SNP), encouraged by its victory in the 2007 Scottish parliament elections, set itself a target of returning 20 MPs and hoped to find itself holding a balance of power. Equally, Plaid Cymru sought gains in Wales. In Northern Ireland the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) aimed to maintain or increase its number of seats, having been the fourth largest party in the House of Commons. Smaller parties which had had successes at local elections and the 2009 European elections (UK Independence Party, Green Party, British National Party) aimed to extend their representation to seats in the House of Commons. The election The general election was held on Thursday 6 May 2010 and saw an increase in voter turnout from 61% in 2005 to 65% in 2010. Throughout the day GfK NOP and Ipsos MORI conducted an exit poll on behalf of the BBC, Sky and ITV news services – the results of which were announced as the polls closed at 10:00 pm. Data gathered from individuals at 130 polling stations around the country suggested a hung parliament, with an initial estimate that the Conservative Party would achieve 307 seats – 19 seats short of a controlling majority. This deficit was later adjusted to 21 seats. The distribution of seats was initially predicted to be 307 to the Conservatives, 255 to Labour, 59 to the Liberal Democrats and 29 to the other parties, but these figures were later updated with a minor adjustment in Labour's favour. The apparently poor prospects for the Liberal Democrats were a surprise to commentators, as many previous opinion polls had indicated they would receive more seats. A later BBC exit poll published at 5:36 am on Friday 7 May predicted the Conservatives on 306, 20 short of an overall majority, with Labour on 262, and the Liberal Democrats on 55. At 9:41am on 7 May, the BBC confirmed a \\"hung parliament\\", as it was by then impossible for the Conservative party to gain the number of seats needed to form a majority government. 326 seats were required for a technical majority, but only 323 were necessary for a practical majority, as the five Sinn Féin MPs were expected to boycott the House of Commons. At that time the Conservatives stood at 290 seats, Labour at 247 and Liberal Democrats at 51. The final results put the Conservatives on 306 seats, Labour on 258, and the Liberal Democrats on 57. House of Commons following the 2010 general election. No party achieved an overall majority. Of the 532 seats contested in England, the Conservatives won an absolute majority of 61 seats and secured an average swing of 5.6% from Labour. The last seat to be elected, Thirsk and Malton, was contested on 27 May because one of the candidates died. All of Scotland's 59 seats were won by the parties that won them at the 2005 election, with Labour regaining the two seats they lost in by-elections since 2005. Labour increased its share of the vote by 2.5% and the Conservatives by 0.9%, giving a swing from the Conservatives to Labour of 0.8%. The Conservatives won only one Scottish constituency, while the SNP – which had hoped to increase its share of seats from seven to 20 – failed to make any headway. 40 seats were contested in Wales, where the Conservative share rose from three seats to eight, taking one from the Liberal Democrats and four from Labour. Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru gained one extra seat, Arfon, from Labour. Overall, Labour lost four seats but remained the biggest party in Wales with 26 seats. 18 seats were contested in Northern Ireland, where both Irish nationalist parties, Sinn Féin and the SDLP, held their seats, the unionist UUP (in an electoral pact with the Conservatives) lost their only seat and the DUP lost a seat. This left the nationalist parties with eight seats, the unionist parties with eight seats (all DUP), the Alliance Party with one seat and an independent unionist with one seat. It was the first time since the Partition of Ireland that unionist parties had failed to secure a majority of Northern Ireland's Westminster seats in a general election. Initial statements and negotiations Conservative leader David Cameron seen leaving St Stephen's Club on the afternoon of 7 May 2010, the day his party began negotiations with the Liberal Democrats to form a government. With no single party having achieved an overall majority, the 2010 general election resulted in the first hung parliament since 1974. When it became clear that no party would achieve the outright majority needed to form the next government, the three main party leaders made public statements offering to discuss the options for putting together an administration with the other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called on Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative leader David Cameron to act \\"in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage\\". However, having stated before the election that the party with the most seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Speaking outside the Liberal Democrat headquarters he said: \\"It is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest.\\" Brown said he intended to play his part in securing \\"a stable, strong and principled government\\", and indicated his willingness to speak with both Clegg and Cameron on how to achieve this, saying: \\"What we have seen are no ordinary election results.\\" But shortly after, Cameron held a press conference at which he invited the Liberal Democrats to talks, saying: \\"I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems - the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system.\\" Under the constitutional rules governing protocol in the event of a hung parliament, Brown, as the sitting Prime Minister, would remain in office until a new government could be formed, a process which could continue without resolution until the State Opening of Parliament, which was scheduled for 25 May. On Brown's instructions, Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell had updated the protocol for dealing with a hung parliament earlier in the year. Following confirmation that no party had achieved an overall majority, Brown authorised O'Donnell to begin the process. Four-member teams of civil servants were sent to liaise with the main political parties to facilitate negotiations. Cameron's willingness to hold talks with the Liberal Democrats was interpreted by BBC News political editor Nick Robinson as hinting at the possibility that Liberal Democrat MPs could serve as part of a Cabinet. On the afternoon of 7 May, Cameron and Clegg spoke by telephone and had what the BBC reported as a \\"very constructive\\" conversation. By that evening exploratory talks between teams of senior representatives from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives had begun. The Liberal Democrats team consisted of Chris Huhne, Danny Alexander, Andrew Stunell and David Laws, while George Osborne, William Hague, Oliver Letwin and Ed Llewellyn made up the Conservative team. Further talks By the morning of Saturday 8 May, talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were fully underway. A 70-minute meeting at Admiralty House in Westminster was described by both parties as being \\"constructive and amicable\\", and another meeting was scheduled for the following day. At a private meeting that evening, Cameron and Clegg held the first of a series of talks to discuss the negotiations. Members of the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Party had earlier met at Local Government House to discuss the coalition talks. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg held face-to-face talks with his Conservative counterpart. One of the chief issues that the Liberal Democrats wished to address in any coalition agreement was that of electoral reform, and as Party members debated the negotiations, a 1,000 strong crowd of protesters from the pressure group 38 Degrees gathered outside. Amid chants of \\"Fair votes now\\" and \\"We want to speak to Nick\\", Clegg briefly left the meeting to accept a petition and told the protesters, \\"Reforming politics is one of the reasons I went into politics.\\" After the meeting, a Liberal Democrats negotiator, David Laws, said members had \\"endorsed in full\\" the strategy outlined by Clegg that the Conservatives should have first choice in negotiations on forming a government. Clegg also met with the party's federal executive, which also endorsed Clegg's decision. 8 May 2010 was the 65th anniversary of VE Day – which marked the victory of the Allied Forces over Nazi Germany and the end of the Second World War in Europe – and celebrations were held to mark the occasion. The leaders of all three parties attended a ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, a duty which normally falls to the Prime Minister. After the ceremony, Brown flew to his family home in Scotland, but remained ready to negotiate with the Liberal Democrats if no deal with the Conservatives was reached. Labour denied reports of a heated telephone conversation between Brown and Clegg, and support among Brown's Cabinet colleagues remained strong, but one backbencher, John Mann, urged Brown to step aside as Labour leader before the party conference in September, arguing that Brown's continued leadership \\"rules out the credibility of a Lib/Lab pact\\". Negotiations continue On Sunday 9 May, senior negotiators from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives embarked on six hours of talks at the Cabinet Office, which were described as \\"very positive and productive\\". William Hague emerged from the discussions to say, \\"The issues that we have covered have included political reform, economic issues and reduction of the deficit, banking reform, civil liberties, environmental issues. So, we've had good discussions about all of those areas. We are agreed that a central part of any agreement that we make will be economic stability and the reduction of the budget deficit, but each negotiating team is now going to report to our party leaders.\\" As the negotiations were taking place, Gordon Brown returned to Downing Street and held a meeting with Nick Clegg at the Foreign Office for talks. A Downing Street spokesman later confirmed the talks, together with the previous evening's telephone conversation between Brown and Clegg, which was described as \\"an amicable discussion.\\" However, Paddy Ashdown – a previous Liberal Democrat leader – offered a different view of the Brown-Clegg conference call, telling the BBC it \\"was a diatribe, a rant, and that Gordon Brown was threatening in his approach to Nick Clegg.\\" Following the success of the talks between their two parties, Clegg and Cameron held a second round of face-to-face discussions at Westminster that evening, lasting 45 minutes. While negotiations continued to form the next administration, the business of government continued with the previous incumbents. In this respect Chancellor Alistair Darling flew to Brussels to attend a meeting of European finance ministers. In London, Brown held meetings with Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, his deputy leader Harriet Harman, Secretary of State for Energy Ed Miliband and Tony Blair's former special adviser Alastair Campbell. Brown also sent an email to party activists in which he thanked them for their work during the election campaign. It concluded \\"The past few days have seen us enter a political landscape not considered possible a few short weeks ago - with the outcome of the election leading to no single party able to form a majority government. My duty as prime minister has been to seek to resolve this situation.\\" Several senior Labour backbenchers, including MP George Howarth called on Brown to step down. Labour enters the picture Labour leader Gordon Brown was seen as a major stumbling block to forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Monday 10 May saw another day of talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but at a meeting with his MPs, Nick Clegg was urged to give assurances over offers which were being made by David Cameron's team. They also wished him to continue negotiations with Labour. During the day it emerged that senior Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives had held discussions about forming a coalition, but that one of the barriers to this was the continued presence of Gordon Brown as Prime Minister. At 5:00 pm that afternoon Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September. In a statement he said that he intended to \\"[A]sk the Labour Party to set in train the processes needed for its own leadership election.\\" The statement went on to say, \\"I would hope that it would be completed in time for the new leader to be in post by the time of the Labour Party conference. I will play no part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate.\\" He also urged any prospective candidates for the position to wait until coalition negotiations were complete before announcing their candidacy. Following this announcement, formal talks began between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with Labour's negotiating team consisting of Peter Mandelson, Harriet Harman, Andrew Adonis, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. However, many in Labour felt that a coalition with the Liberal Democrats was an unrealistic prospect since it would still fall short of the 326 seats needed to form a majority government, with 315 seats to the Conservatives' 306. Labour MP Graham Stringer said, \\"I don't think it makes sense in the arithmetic – the numbers don't add up.\\" However, in his account of Labour's negotiations with the Liberal Democrats, Andrew Adonis – who participated in the talks – writes that the general consensus among members of Gordon Brown's cabinet was that talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would reach an impasse. \\"[The] process would turn to our favour once the Tories and Lib Dems had rehearsed the extent of their differences\\". With Labour now attempting to form its own coalition government, the Conservatives promised the Liberal Democrats a referendum on changing the voting mechanism to the alternative vote (AV) system. In response Labour said that it would introduce AV then hold a public referendum to approve it. In a statement outlining his decision to negotiate with Labour, Clegg said that although his party had made progress with the Conservatives, they had not \\"reached a comprehensive partnership agreement for a full Parliament\\" and negotiating with Labour was the \\"responsible thing to do\\". The possibility of some SNP involvement in a Labour-led government materialised when Angus Robertson, the SNP's leader in the House of Commons suggested its MPs would be willing to join Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and MPs from other smaller parties to form a rainbow coalition. It was reported on 10 May that a meeting to discuss this scenario was held between Robertson, the SNP Chief Whip Stewart Hosie and Cabinet Office officials the previous evening. However, Labour's Douglas Alexander said he could not foresee a situation in which Labour could enter into government with the SNP because the two parties had \\"fundamental differences\\", and he made it clear that no senior Labour officials had been approached by anyone from the SNP. Coalition deal reached By 11 May, the possibility of a deal between the Liberal Democrats and Labour was looking unlikely. Talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation that evening. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. He then left Downing Street with his wife and their children, and drove to Buckingham Palace where he tendered his resignation to the Queen and advised her to call for David Cameron. Cameron became Prime Minister one hour after the Queen accepted Brown's resignation, and arrived at Downing Street with his wife, Samantha shortly afterwards. In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Cameron met with his MPs in the Committee Room of the House of Commons at 10:00 pm, where he was greeted with cheering that could be heard from the central hall of the Commons. Cameron later told a BBC documentary that he had not expected to become Prime Minister, and the coalition agreement had not yet been completed when Brown resigned. Speaking on the programme, Five Days That Changed Britain, broadcast on 29 July, he said that when he went to meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the coalition deal had not been finalised. Formally, the monarch can only invite a prospective Prime Minister to form a government; the shape of the government is for the new Prime Minister to decide. William Hague said that as Cameron travelled to the Palace, the coalition agreement was still being completed and signed. Shortly after midnight on 12 May 2010, the Liberal Democrats emerged from a meeting of their Parliamentary party and Federal Executive to announce that the coalition deal had been \\"approved overwhelmingly\\", meaning that David Cameron would lead a coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Later that day, the two parties jointly published the Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement specifying the terms of the deal. Cameron appointed his first Cabinet, which included several senior Conservative and Liberal Democrat figures. From the Conservatives, George Osborne became Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Hague was named as Foreign Secretary as well as the honorary title of First Secretary of State and Oliver Letwin was appointed as Minister of State for the Cabinet Office. Liberal Democrat appointments included Danny Alexander as Secretary of State for Scotland, Chris Huhne as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, David Laws as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Vince Cable became Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and President of the Board of Trade. Cameron and Clegg gave their first joint press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden on the afternoon of 12 May, telling journalists the purpose of their government would be give our country the strong, stable and decisive leadership we need\\". The new Parliamentary session began with the State Opening of Parliament on 25 May. Cameron attended his first Prime Minister's Questions as Prime Minister on Wednesday 2 June. Labour became the party of opposition, and with Brown's departure, Harriet Harman became its acting leader. On 18 May 2010 Labour's National Executive Committee announced the details of the leadership election. Ed Miliband was elected as the party's new leader at its annual national conference on 25 September 2010.

The fifth named storm within the northwestern Pacific that year, Linfa developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May 25\\\\. The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis. However, intensification leveled off as Linfa executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May 27\\\\. Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and decoupled before reforming in the Philippine Sea. Afterwards Linfa began reintensifying and reached its peak intensity on May 29 with maximum sustained winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May 30; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of Okhotsk on June 4\\\\. The erratic and slow movement of Linfa off the western Philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding, killing 41 persons in the archipelago. Precipitation peaked at near Dagupan. Rising floodwaters resulted in numerous mudslides and the temporary shutdown of government offices. In addition, strong winds caused widespread power outages. Overall damage from Linfa in the Philippines amounted to ₱192.3 million (US$3.65 million). The floods also displaced 8,367 people in 1,686 families and destroyed 178 homes. Linfa and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to Japan, particularly southwestern regions. Rainfall there peaked at 727 mm (28.62 in). Flood damage was worst in Kōchi and Tokushima Prefectures, where several buildings were destroyed by floodwater. Other locations in Japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides. Overall, Linfa caused roughly $28.2 million in damage, much of which occurred in Japan, though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the Philippines. Meteorological history In late-May an area of disturbed weather began to persist roughly 650 km (400 mi) west of Manila, Philippines in the South China Sea. Late on May 23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to monitor the area for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis. Over the next few days the disturbance began to consolidate towards a common low pressure center, resulting in a burst in convective activity. At 0000 UTC on May 25, the JTWC classified the resulting system as a tropical depression west of Luzon; six hours later both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began to monitor the newly formed tropical cyclone, though the latter classified it as a tropical storm. During these initial stages of development the tropical cyclone slowly intensified as it slowly tracked in a clockwise loop throughout the course of the day. At 1800 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status while the JMA followed suit six hours later, thus designating the cyclone with the name Linfa. In response to a strengthening ridge to the south, Linfa began tracking eastward. Despite its proximity to land, the tropical storm's slow forward motion allowed for additional strengthening, and according to the JMA, Linfa reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 km/h (50 mph) at 0000 UTC on May 27, just within the threshold of severe tropical storm status. Concurrently the cyclone made landfall near Dagupan, Luzon. Upon landfall, Linfa began to weaken as it crossed Luzon before emerging into the Pacific as a minimal tropical storm late that day. However, as a result of land interaction the initial surface circulation center of Linfa greatly weakened and was overtaken by a newly formed low-level circulation center on May 28, resulting in the storm's position to shift well northeastward. This was the primary basis on which the JTWC downgraded Linfa to tropical depression status early on May 28, though the JMA continued to analyze the system as a weak tropical storm. Afterwards, as the cyclone began to track northeastward, the new circulation center became more organized, resulting in the JTWC reclassifying Linfa as a tropical storm at 0600 UTC the following day. Gradual strengthening followed, and at 1800 UTC that day Linfa reached peak intensity with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg) south of Okinawa. Subsequently, the system began to take a more northward course and undergo extratropical transition, which was completed at 0000 UTC on May 30\\\\. Though by this time most tropical cyclone monitoring agencies ceased the monitoring of these extratropical remnants by this time, the JMA continued to track them as they made landfall near Uwajima, Ehime at 0800 UTC the following day. Linfa's remnants then paralleled the western coast of Japan before dissipating on June 4 well into the Sea of Okhotsk. Impact and aftermath Philippines Tropical Storm Linfa making landfall in Ilocos Region, Luzon on May 27 Linfa's slow movement off the western coast of Luzon, followed by its eventual landfall, allowed for copious amounts of rain to occur in areas of the Philippines, leading to widespread flooding. Prior to landfall, waves generated by Linfa offshore hampered search and rescue operations following the collision of the MV San Nicholas and SuperFerry 12 ships on May 25. Over land, precipitation amounts officially peaked at a station in Dagupan, near the tropical storm's point of landfall. There, of rainfall was observed, including of rain in a 12‑hour period. The second highest precipitation total from a station operated by the World Meteorological Organization observed of rain in Baguio. These rainfall totals were further enhanced by the concurrent southwesterly monsoon. The resulting floods forced then-President of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo to order the temporary shutdown of government offices and mobilize city officials to aid in clearing threatened areas of people. In addition, commuter bus operations were forced to cease. The first documented fatality associated with the storm occurred in Taytay, Rizal, after heavy rains on May 27 triggered a mudslide that killed an infant and injured three other people. That same day the rains resulted in thick traffic jams in Manila. Strong winds in the capital city also toppled billboards and electric posts. Floodwaters forced over 600 families to evacuate in Valenzuela, a suburb located northwest of Manila. Similarly strong winds in Pangasinan caused widespread power outage to much of the province. Areas in the central parts of the province experienced their worst flooding conditions in at least 60 years. Two ferries capsized off of Minalabac, Camarines Sur, killing six people. Sixty-seven others were rescued in the search and rescue operation that followed the incident. Overall, Linfa killed 41 people in the Philippines due to flooding. Damage associated with the tropical storm included ₱66 million (US$1.25 million) to agriculture and livestock, ₱83.4 million (US$1.58 million) to fisheries, and ₱42.9 million (US$800,000) to infrastructure, equating to a total of ₱192.3 million (US$3.65 million) in damage in the Philippines. Nationwide, 8,367 persons in roughly 1,686 families evacuated into 44 evacuation centers at the height of the storm. The floods destroyed 178 homes and damaged an additional 2,040. In the immediate aftermath of the storm and associated flooding, the Department of Agriculture readied for the distribution of 3 million bangus fry, 250,000 tilapia fry, and 315 bags of rice seeds to affected regions. Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200 sacks of rice to Pangasinan. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council assisted in relief operations by allocating ₱10 million (US$200,000) and 800 bags of rice for such efforts. In addition, one of eight regional Filipino health offices distributed roughly ₱600,000 (US$10,000) worth of various medicines to Dagupan and Urdaneta, Pangasinan. According to the National Disaster Coordinating Council, ₱15.7 million (US$300,000) worth in relief operations was allocated. Japan TRMM. After tracking eastward across the Philippines, Linfa reorganized and curved northeastward toward Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency anticipated heavy precipitation and strong winds in the island nation's southwestern regions. The agency also warned residents in low-lying areas of potential flooding. The JMA indicated the heightened possibility of landslides in the Tōhoku region due to a recent earthquake in the area. Due to the forecasted impacts and track, as many as 102 domestic flights were cancelled in a single day, particularly those associated with southwestern Japan. In addition, five ferry services were cancelled. Upon making landfall on Shikoku, Linfa became the first tropical cyclone since 1965 to strike Japan during May, as well as the third earliest tropical cyclone to make landfall on any of Japan's four main islands since standardized records began in 1951. Throughout Linfa's passage of Japan, the storm brought heavy rainfall across a wide swath of the country, resulting in extensive and damaging flooding. Damage was primarily concentrated on Kyushu Island. Precipitation peaked at 727 mm (28.62 in) at a station in Nakagoya, Miyazaki Prefecture. However, a station in Owase, Mie observed 497 mm (19.56 in) of rain in 24 hours, greater than any other location for that period of time. Despite making landfall on Ehime Prefecture, Linfa did not cause as much damage there relative to other provinces, particularly those bordering Ehime. Nonetheless, nearly 300 homes lost power during the storm there. Linfa's worst impacts occurred in Kōchi Prefecture, where severe flooding inundated several buildings and triggered numerous landslides. Damage there totaled ¥1.28 billion (US$10.7 million). Similar effects took place in Tokushima Prefecture, in addition to widespread evacuations from impacted areas. Damage accrued by Linfa in Tokushima Prefecture reached ¥1.22 billion (US$10.3 million). Located near the coast, high seas generated by Linfa were reported in Wakayama Prefecture, resulting in cancellations of offshore activities and transportation. However, much of the damage in Wakayama Prefecture was caused by torrential precipitation, damaging roads in seven locations, amounting to ¥197.45 million (US$1.65 million). Severe flooding in Mie Prefecture resulted from heavy, prolonged rainfall, which peaked prefecture-wide at 497 mm (19.57 in) in Owase. Precipitation in Mie caused widespread power outages. As many as 65 buildings were flooded, and approximately 87 ha (215 ac) of arable land was inundated by rainwater. In addition to surface inundation, the rains caused twenty landslides, blocking roads the traffic and suspending some rail operations. Power outages were also widespread in Hyōgo Prefecture, including a localized outage stripping electricity from 900 homes in the Kita-ku ward in Kobe; similar impacts occurred in Osaka Prefecture. Rising floodwater in Kanagawa Prefecture engulfed the first floors of several office buildings and residences. The rain also deluged roads in Yokohama, Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Odawara. On Nishino-shima Island in Honshu's Shimane Prefecture, precipitation caused the deterioration of surface sediments, resulting in landslides that damaged several buildings. Agricultural damage totaled to ¥660,000 (US$5,500), and three flights were cancelled at Oki Airport. Multiple landslides occurred in Miyagi Prefecture. In Kesennuma, the rains triggered a rockfall, prompting evacuations and damaging a home. A second rockfall incident occurred on June 2, destroying several buildings. Residents of Ogachi and Ishinomaki were ordered to evacuate due to the threat of additional rockfalls and landslides, . In both Hino and Kurayoshi, Tottori, heavy rain caused damage to roads and farmland erosion. The precipitation also caused a river to flow over its banks, flooding adjacent land. Damage in Tottori Prefecture amounted to ¥890 million (US$75,000). Significant damage occurred in Ōita Prefecture, where heavy rains caused landslides and suspended rail operations. Most of the damage in Ōita Prefecture was done to crops, particularly vegetables, and totaled ¥27.37 million (US$230,000). Damage to sweet potato and tobacco crops alone in Kagoshima Prefecture reached ¥21 million (US$180,000), while damage to agricultural infrastructure totaled ¥2 million (US$16,800). Damage to tobacco crops in Miyazaki Prefecture were estimated even higher at ¥50.57 million (US$420,000). In Nagasaki Prefecture, the rains also damaged forests, with damage estimated at ¥23 million (US$190,000); other agricultural damage was estimated at ¥60 million (US$500,000). Voluntary evacuation procedures took place in Fukue, Nagasaki due to the threat of building collapse. Despite transitioning into an extratropical cyclone during its passage of Japan, Linfa still maintained strong winds, which caused heavy damage to susceptible structures. The highest wind associated with Linfa in Japan was clocked at 119 km/h (74 mph) in Murotomisaki, Kōchi Prefecture. Operations on the Tōhoku Main Line were delayed as a result of strong winds onset by Linfa. Wind gusts as high as 55 km/h (35 mph) in Nakatsugawa in Tochigi Prefecture caused the complete destruction of at least five buildings and damaged several others, resulting in ¥$760,000 (US$6,400) in damage. More considerable damage occurred in Shiga Prefecture, where strong winds caused damage to greenhouses and nearby crops, accruing ¥36.75 million (US$308,700) in damage. In addition, two people were injured after winds threw a section of plywood into the car they were occupying.

History  Aguris are a cultivating and trading caste. According to Santosh Kumar Kundu, they were brought by the ruler of Burdwan from Agra to West Bengal to fight against the British colonists. William Benjamin Oldham, a British civil servant and ethnographer who wrote Some Historical and Ethnical Aspects of Burdwan District (1891), said that they originated from marriage alliances between the Sadgop rulers of Gopbhum and the Khatri rulers of Burdwan.

Louis Frederick of Württemberg was born at Montbéliard Castle as the fifth child and second son of Duke Frederick I of Württemberg, and princess Sibylla of Anhalt.  Life  In 1608 Louis Frederick came to England to return his father's insignia of the Order of the Garter and visited Scotland, where he was hosted by Andrew Melville of Garvock.William Fraser, Melvilles, Earls of Melville, and the Leslies, Earls of Leven (Edinburgh, 1890), p. 166: Dorothea Nolde, 'Religion and the Display of Power', C. Scott Dixon, Dagmar Freist, Mark Greengrass, Living with Religious Diversity in Early-modern Europe (Ashgate, 2009), p. 268. On 28 May 1617 Louis Frederick agreed with older brother Duke John Frederick to divide the Württemberg possessions. Louis Frederick received the possessions on the left bank of the Rhine (Montbéliard, Riquewihr and Horburg) with full sovereignty. Thus, Louis Frederick became the founder of the younger Württemberg-Montbéliard line. During the Thirty Years' War, his territory suffered badly from starvation and the plague. After his brother John Frederick died on 28 July 1628, Louis Frederick moved to Stuttgart, to act as guardian and regent for his fourteen-year-old cousin Eberhard III. His tenure as regent was dominated by conflicts with Emperor Ferdinand II, after Württemberg lost about a third of its territory due to the Edict of Restitution. In November 1630, Louis Frederick returned to Montbéliard, where he died on 26 January 1631.  Marriage and issue  Louis Frederick married on 14 July 1617 with Elisabeth Magdalena of Hesse-Darmstadt, daughter of Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. The marriage produced three children: * Christopher (24 December 1620 - 1 January 1621) * Henriette Louise (20 June 1623 - 24 August 1650) married on 21 August 1642 with Margrave Albert II of Brandenburg-Ansbach * Leopold Frederick (30 May 1624 - 15 June 1662), his successor After Elisabeth Magdalena's death on 9 June 1624, Louis Frederick married on 15 May 1625 with Anna Eleonora of Nassau-Weilburg-Saarbrücken. This marriage also produced three children: * George II (5 October 1626 - 1 June 1699) * Henry (19 December 1627 - January 1628) * Georgia Ludovica (1 February 1630 - 11 April 1630)  External links  * References Princes of Württemberg Dukes of Württemberg Counts of Montbéliard 1586 births 1631 deaths 17th-century German people ","title":"Louis Frederick, Duke of Württemberg-Montbéliard"},{"id":"34080194","title":"List of ambassadors to Lithuania"},{"id":"34080201","title":"Good Times &amp; Bad Advice"},{"id":"34080208","text":"Jak and Daxter Collection (known in the PAL region as The Jak and Daxter Trilogy) is a collection of the remastered ports of the first three games in the Jak and Daxter series. The remasters were developed by Mass Media Games, with grounds on the originals by Naughty Dog, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Development In July 2011, Naughty Dog's Co-president Evan Wells stated in an interview with Game Informer that they would \\"love\\" to return to the series, but said they were currently \\"focusing\\" on Uncharted 3. Wells revealed in a later interview that they had explored the idea of a new game in the series \\"fairly extensively\\" before development began on The Last of Us. Neil Druckmann elaborated further in an interview for The Last of Us. He said they had planned on making a reboot of the series, and had spent a long time searching for ideas and concepts they would get excited by, but discover that \\"the ideas we were getting passionate about were getting away from what Jak and Daxter was.\\" They later hinted, however, that a \\"dark, dirty and dangerous\\" collection was in the works. In October 2011, according to Digital Spy, an online business in South Africa known as BT Games had a Jak and Daxter Collection listed for release in January 2012.

It serves as the season two 12th and 13th episode and the 32nd and 33rd episode of the series overall as it is commonly broadcast divided in two parts. It aired on February 21, 2011. Just like the three previous Big Time Rush movies, Big Time Beach Party does not differ in either the direction or the structure from a typical Big Time Rush episode. So practically is a two- part episode promoted as a movie since the adventures get bigger. In the movie/episode the guys get the chance to spend a day in a beach house but things seem to develop quite differently from how they expected. The show's main cast along with the majority of the common recurring cast and several special guest stars are featured.  Production  Filming of the episode began on the last days of November 2010 and ended two weeks after on December 10. Several pictures were revealed since, whereas the first promo came out around the end of the year. Both Russell Brand's and Tom Kenny's participation were soon announced by Twitter and other media. The movie aired on February 21, 2011.  Plot  As part of a deal Griffin made with Big Time Rush, they get to use his beach house in Malibu for a day when they get a gold record in any country, as they do. The boys invite almost everyone from the Palm Woods to the beach including Camille, Guitar Dude, the Jennifers and Buddha Bob as well as Jo who can't make it, because of some extra scenes she has to film for her series. Also Mrs. Knight goes after the boys with Katie when she figures out they didn't put sunblock on like she told them, while Gustavo and Kelly plan to destroy Big Time Rush's beach day since Gustavo's previous band \\"Boy Blast\\" have become overly laid back by their life in beach and their career went downhill. ''' At the beach, Kendall stumbles across an old man, J.D., seemingly being able to predict the future, as well as a fan girl named Sandy, who turns out to be highly obsessed with Kendall and breaks up with her boyfriend so as to be with him and also attempts to get rid of Jo. Carlos tries to impress the Jennifers but they reject him for not owning the beach house, so he comes up with a plan of buying one and therefore joins Logan who is searching for treasure. They soon come across Patchy the Pirate (Tom Kenny), who seems to seek for a hidden treasure chest filled with gold using his family's map and they join his treasure hunt and collect clues that bring them closer to the treasure. At the same time, James almost gets drown while surfing, but gets saved by a cute girl, Annie (Gage Golightly) with whom he instantly hits it off, though he has reservations after thinking that she may be a mermaid, so he enlists Camille to help him find out. Kendall asks the Jennifers to help him repel Sandy but fails again and as if things weren't already bad enough for him, Sandy's boyfriend, Tad, shows up to beat him up for stealing his girlfriend. In the meantime, Gustavo and Kelly try to sabotage the guys' beach day but face some unfortunate events during their numerous efforts. On the other hand, Katie decides to lay the foundations of her career by asking their beach house neighbor, actor Russell Brand, to let her be his manager but he does not accept her because of her age, despite the amazing stuff he admits she is accomplishing for him. Mrs. Knight, having arrived at the beach and succeeded in covering the boys up with sunblock, advises Kendall to let Sandy know that he doesn't want to be with her and so he does. Meanwhile, Logan, Carlos and Patchy find out that chest is under the basement of Griffin's beach house and when they manage to dig him up, Griffin shows up and collects the treasure as compensation for the damages they caused in their search. However Patchy promises them to reunite with it. Elsewhere, Annie reveals herself not to be a mermaid and she and James get back together. Finally, to settle the differences between Kendall and Tad, J.D. suggests they should do a drag race and whoever loses has to leave the beach forever alongside their company. Kendall and Tad take the challenge and despite Gustavo's another effort to make Kendall lose, he ultimately wins the race at the last minute. Jo, who just called Camille the very after minute, hears Kendall confessing his feelings about herself and dumping Sandy and informs him that she is coming there the soonest. Katie, who at last gets Russell Brand to accept her as his manager, arranges that the guys would perform at his party and Big Time Rush finally admit their day to be the “best beach day ever”.

Walter immigrated to the US in 1865. He moved to San Francisco in 1874, where he opened a concert saloon called The Fountain on Kearny Street. He managed the Vienna Gardens on Stockton Street and then opened the Wigwam Variety Hall on the same street. In 1886, he then built a grand theater on O'Farrell Street which would seat 3500. This was the Orpheum Opera House which staged performances of opera, plays and vaudeville. The prices started at 10 cents for the balcony or children up to 50 cents for a box. This was low at the time and the theater soon became the most popular in San Francisco. Following this success, he opened another Orpheum in Los Angeles and then another in Sacramento. This was the start of the successful Orpheum Circuit which became a major chain of theatres. Walter overspent on expensive acts from Europe such as Parisian ballet or a Hungarian boys military band. His chronic shortage of money led him the lease the Orpheum to John Cort in 1891. The financial panic of 1893 forced Cort out and Walter returned to manage the Orpheum with Morris Meyerfeld, Jr. providing the finance and business acumen. Meyerfield organized a chain of theaters from the Pacific coast to the Mid-West. The Kansas City Orpheum opened in 1898 but then Gustav Walter died of appendicitis on 9 May. Meyerfield immediately announced that the show would go on and the Orpheum circuit continued to expand with Martin Beck as its general manager.

Weisbrod (born February 13, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American economist who pioneered the theory of option value and also advanced methods for benefit-cost analysis of public policy by recognizing the roles of externality effects in program evaluation. He applied those methods to the fields of education, health care, poverty and nonprofit organization. Over a career of fifty years, he published 16 books and over 200 scholarly articles. He is currently the John Evans Professor of Economics and a Faculty Fellow of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. Contributions to economics * Option Value – Weisbrod is acknowledged to have developed the concept and coined the term option value as used in welfare economics to represent a portion of total economic value. His 1964 article introduced the idea that individuals may derive a benefit (referred to as \\"option value\\") from having access to use of a publicly provided good or service even if they are uncertain whether or not they will actually use it.Weisbrod, Burton A., 1964. \\"Collective-Consumption Services of Individual-Consumption Goods,\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 78(3). That concept has since come to be applied as an important tool in the valuation of parks, natural resources and environmental amenities, as well as access to public transit services.Arrow, Kenneth J and Anthony C. Fisher, 1974. \\"Environmental Preservation, Uncertainty and Irreversibility,\\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 88(2), May.Schmalensee, Richard, 1972. \\"Option Demand and Consumer's Surplus: Valuing Price Changes under Uncertainty,\\" American Economic Review, 62(5), December.Bishop, Richard C., 1982. \\"Option Value: An Exposition and Extension,\\" Land Economics, 58(1), February.Cicchetti, Charles J. and Freeman, A.

Economics of Public Health, Univ. of Pennsylvania Press.Weisbrod, Burton A. 1964. External Benefits of Public Education, Princeton University Press. That work, which showed the income growth benefits from investment in human capital, is recognized as advancing the use of benefit-cost analysis considerations in the area of public policy. That provided a justification for President Johnson's War on Poverty in the mid 1960s, which included education and health care as tools for poverty reduction. As a Senior Staff member of the President's Council of Economic Advisors in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Weisbrod is credited with helping define the antipoverty program strategy that later led to the Head Start Program for preschool education.Vinovskis, Maris A., 2005. The Birth of Head Start, University of Chicago Press. * Economics of Health Policy – Weisbrod was a pioneer in the development of benefit-cost analysis for health care. In the 1970s, he led two program evaluations that were considered path-breaking because they brought together economic, social and medical professionals to assess multi-year pilot programs. A study in the Caribbean developed the connection between health, worker productivity and economic development,Weisbrod et al, 1974. Disease and Economic Development: The Case of Parasitic Diseases, University of Wisconsin Press. and it provided support for international aid agencies to invest in disease prevention.Weisbrod et al, 1983. Human Resources, Employment and Development, v.3: The Problems of Developed Countries and the International Economy, MacMillan Press, London. It was followed by a study in the US that showed net cost savings and medical benefit gains from switching patients out of mental hospitals and into aggressive outpatient programs.Weisbrod, BA, MA Test and LI Stein, 1980. \\"Alternative to Mental Hospital Treatment, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 37(4).Weisbrod et al, 1981. Economics and Mental Health, National Institute of Mental Health. Over the next thirty years, that finding was used as a basis for a national movement towards closing mental hospitals and replacing them with outpatient services. However, the adequacy of replacement outpatient services in controlling mental illness remains an issue of public discussion.McGuire, Thomas G., 1991. \\"Measuring the Economic Cost of Schizophrenia,\\" Schizophrenia Bulletin, Oxford Journals, 17(3). * Nonprofit Sector – In a series of four books issued each decade from 1978 to 2008, Weisbrod further developed theory to explain the comparative economic behavior of for-profit, government, and private nonprofit organizations, and the causes and consequences of the growing commercialism of nonprofits.Weisbrod, The Voluntary Nonprofit Sector: An Economic Analysis, Lexington Books, New York.Weisbrod, The Nonprofit Economy, Harvard University Press, Cambridge.Weisbrod, To Profit or Not to Profit: the Commercial Transformation of the Nonprofit Sector, Cambridge University Press.Weisbrod, Mission and Money: Understanding the University, Cambridge University Press. As part of this effort, he calculated the value of voluntary labor in the United States, which is a factor considered in the analysis of efficiency wage. Education Weisbrod was born on February 13, 1931, in Chicago. He graduated from Von Steuben High School and then earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, followed by a Ph.D. in Economics from Northwestern University. Career Weisbrod is currently the John Evans Professor of Economics at Northwestern University. From 1990 to 1995, Weisbrod served as director of Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research (IPR), then known as the Center for Urban Affairs and Policy Research. Before that, he spent 26 years on the economics faculty at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he was Evjue-Bascom Professor of Economics, Director of the Center for Health Economics and Law, and Director of the National Institute of Mental Health Training Program in Health and Mental Health Economics. Weisbrod was appointed by then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala to the National Advisory Research Resources Council of the National Institutes of Health for a four-year term from 1999 to 2003. From 2000 to 2005, Weisbrod was chair of the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Committee overseeing its program on Philanthropy and the Nonprofit Sector; from 2002 to 2005 he was a member of the National Academy of Sciences Panel on the Measurement of Nonmarket Activity, and since 2005 he has been a member of the Internal Revenue Service User Group Advisory Committee. Weisbrod served earlier as a Senior Staff Economist on the Council of Economic Advisors under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He also previously held positions on the Economics faculty at Washington University in St. Louis and Carleton College in Minnesota. During his career, he also served as a Visiting Professor at Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government, Yale University, Princeton University, University of California-Berkeley, University of California-San Diego, Brandeis University, Binghamton University, the Australian National University and Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. Awards and honors Weisbrod was elected to the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences. He was elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in addition to being elected to its Governing Council for 1998-2000.

Globally, governance of the soil has been limited to an agricultural perspective due to increased food insecurity from the most populated regions on earth. The Global Soil Partnership, GSP, was initiated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and its members with the hope to improve governance of the limited soil resources of the planet in order to guarantee healthy and productive soils for a food-secure world, as well as support other essential ecosystem services. Governing the soil requires international and national collaboration between governments, local authorities, industries and citizens to ensure implementation of coherent policies that encourage practices and methodologies that regulate usage of the resource to avoid conflict between users to promote sustainable land management. In the European Union's environmental policies, soil is recognized as a non-renewable resource, but its governance is maintained at a national level, unlike other non-renewable and climate sensitive resources. In the developing world, soil governance is biased towards promoting sustainable agriculture and ensuring food security. Governance of the soil differs from soil management. Soil management involves practices and techniques used to increase and maintain soil fertility, structure, and carbon sequestration, etc. Soil management techniques are heavily utilized in agriculture, because of the need to regulate the various practices, such as tillage techniques, fertilizer application and crop rotation (among others) by the various stakeholders involved. The need to monitor and avoid the negative effects of agricultural land use such as soil erosion has formed the basis of the discourse and awareness on soil governance, and has also seen the emergence of science and technology as the link between soil management and governance. Soil governance mechanisms are usually encapsulated within the context of land governance, with little focus on urban and industrial soil governance especially in developing countries that have rapid urbanization rates; thus, soil governance is highly interlinked with other atmospheric and anthropogenic processes which may contribute to the difficulty in distinguishing it as an entity. With an aim to make soil data available to all, the Food and Agriculture Organization and UNESCO created a global soil map in 1981 as the main information on the distribution of soil resources. Currently, under the GSP framework, a new global soil information system will be developed. In 2002, the International Union of Soil Sciences proposed December 5 to be \\"World Soil Day\\" to celebrate the importance of soil in our lives. Under the framework of the GSP, the sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly in December 2013 designated December 5 as the World Soil Day and declared 2015 as the International Year of Soils with the aim to raise awareness on the importance of soils for ecosystem functions and food security . Global Soil Partnership Changes in land use, population growth, and the impacts of climate change have led to a gradual process of soil degradation. Soil degradation is a gradual process involving the natural and anthropogenic processes that result in the physical loss (erosion) and reduction in soil quality. The recognition of anthropogenic effects on soil degradation has influenced discourse of urban soil management, and formulation of policies by regional organizations. However, soil remains as the primary medium for food production, thus global soil governance is directed towards the impacts of soil degradation on food production and conflicts that arise between the need for human settlements and space available for food production. The impacts of climate change also contribute to the conflict because carbon dioxide emissions have progressively led to higher average global temperatures, which has led to an increase in soil degradation through erosion, increased salinity, and a reduction in the flora and fauna that contribute to its quality. The Global Soil Partnership (GSP) was established in December 2012 as a mechanism to develop a strong interactive partnership and enhanced collaboration and synergy of efforts between all stakeholders. The GSP's ultimate goal is to achieve food security and restoration of ecosystem services through conserving, enhancing, and restoring soil resources through productive and sustainable use. In addition to being a global partnership, the GSP aims to create Regional Soil Partnerships (RSPs) to provide guidance on goals and priorities within specific regions and develop relevant activities within each region. The GSP meets in Plenary Assembly form to meet the different demands from each region. The First Plenary Assembly, held in June 2013 at the FAO's headquarters adopted the Rules of Procedure, nominated and established an Intergovernmental Technical Panel of Soils (ITPS), started thinking about the 5 pillars of action, supported the implementation of Regional Soil Partnerships and developed a GSP roadmap. The Second Plenary Assembly will be held in July 2014.  Vision and mission  The vision of the GSP is to improve governance of soil resources to guarantee healthy and productive soils for a food-secure world and support other essential ecosystem services. The mission of the GSP is capacity building, facilitate and contribute to soil science and technologies for sustainable management of soil resources at all levels.  Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS)  The Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils, established in 2003, represents all regions of the world and is composed of 27 soil expert representatives. The ITPS is here to advise the GSP on scientific and technical knowledge, advocate for the inclusion of sustainable soil management in different agendas, review the GSP's Plan of Action, follow up on the Plan of Action and request the formation of committees for exceptional cases. Five pillars of action To achieve its vision and mandate, the GSP operates under five pillars of action: #Promote sustainable management of soil resources for soil protection, conservation and sustainable productivity. # Encourage investment, technical cooperation, policy, education awareness and extension in soil # Promote targeted soil research and development focusing on identified gaps and priorities and synergies with related productive, environmental and social development actions # Enhance the quantity and quality of soil data and information: data collection (generation), analysis, validation, reporting, monitoring and integration with other disciplines # Harmonization of methods, measurements and indicators for the sustainable management and protection of soil resources  International Year of Soils  alt=Logo of International Year of Soils 2015 The International Year of Soils, 2015 (IYS 2015) was declared by the Sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly on December 20, 2013 after recognizing December 5 as World Soil Day. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has been nominated to implement the IYS 2015, within the framework of the Global Soil Partnership and in collaboration with Governments and the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The aim of the IYS is to increase awareness and understanding of the importance of soil for food security and essential ecosystem functions. IYS objectives The International Year of Soils aims to: * Raise full awareness among civil society and decision makers about the profound importance of soil for human life; * Educate the public about the crucial role soil plays in food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation, essential ecosystem services, poverty alleviation and sustainable development; * Support effective policies and actions for the sustainable management and protection of soil resources; * Promote investment in sustainable soil management activities to develop and maintain healthy soils for different land users and population groups; * Strengthen initiatives in connection with the SDG process (Sustainable Development Goals) and Post-2015 agenda; Advocate for rapid capacity enhancement for soil information collection and monitoring at all levels (global, regional and national).  By region   In the European Union  The United Nations Earth Summit Conference on Environment and Development catalysed the formation of EU environmental policy into a policy that was centred on the environmental consequences of integration. The conference organized by the United Nations saw the acceptance of various documents and charters governing the natural environment and sustainable development. In its inception phase, EU environmental policy was a reaction to normalise competition with the markets. Having a common policy would ensure that member states were bound to directives that would regulate their production methods thus affect production output and competitive advantage. Focus was directed on air pollution from industries, and other forms of tangible, measurable, and traceable pollution that could be isolated to an event or a process, such as acidification Swedish lakes in the 1970s and 1980s caused by high sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants. Such forms of pollution were often governed with bans, quotas and economic instruments such as taxes and fines. With improvements in technology, access and delivery of information and changes in global conceptualisation of the environment, EU environmental policy has evolved to become more responsive and bespoke, and has also increased its scope to various sources and sinks of pollution. In 2006, the European Commission tabled a proposal to the European Parliament to establish a framework for soil protection within the union. Soil is recognised as a non- renewable resource because of its slow formation process. However—unlike other non-renewable resources, such as coal, that have explicit policies governing extraction methods, trading, and consumption in the EU—soil governance is contained within the contexts of environmental policies and regulation on various entities of the biosphere. The draft policy recognised that soil governance had been \\"scattered\\" in EU legislation, and lacked a cohesive isolated framework, therefore governance and management of the same resource was open to interpretation depending on the main resource and industry policy in question. The policy sought to unify the \\"scattered\\" regulations because they lacked the mandate to \\"identify and cover all soil threats\\". This view was supported by extensive consultation between stakeholders and the European commission that started in February 2003, and saw member states convey their support for a framework based on regional action in 2004. The framework was developed as a directive to member states; this form of legislation allows interpretation by stakeholders at national and local levels, and between networks thus complying with the subsidiarity principle. The principle provides that EU political decisions must be implemented at \\"the lowest possible administrative and political level, and as close to the citizens as possible\\", unless in areas where action by individual countries is insufficient. It is under this principle that member states rejected the proposal to establish a framework for soil protection as the proposal argued that member states are unable to effectively monitor and manage their soils. Inconsistencies in national soil governance strategies and, classification and treatment of contaminants would disable the objectives of the proposal because of the complexities of trans-border soil pollution and management. Furthermore, soil degradation and mismanagement affects other environmental areas, and industries governed through EU legislation such as water, biodiversity, and food production, thus it was deemed appropriate to have uniform legislation across all entities. Member states argued that soil management should not be negotiated at the European Regional level as they already had strong domestic policies regulating soil usage and management, therefore focus should be directed at strengthening local policies and regulatory institution. Consequently, the EU does not have a cohesive soil governance policy and relies on environmental policies, and non-renewable resource policies and legislations of member states to guide utilisation, management and regulate pollutants of the soil.  In India  In terms of employment, the agricultural sector is one of the main sectors in the Indian economy. In 2010, the sector employed 58.2% of the nations workforce, and contributed 15.7% to the nations GDP. Cognisant of agriculture's role in the economy, the 11th five-year economic plan that runs from 2007-2012 recognises the importance of proper soil management in agriculture. Soil degradation through excessive and miscalculated fertiliser use because of emphasis on increased output has led to nearly two-thirds of India's farmlands to be classified as either degraded or sick. In attempts to increase knowledge on soils and soil management, the government of Gujarat initiated the Soil Health Cards Programme in 2006 that was \\"expected to bridge the gap between Scientists, agricultural extension workers, farmers and input-output dealers\\". The programme relies on technology to disseminate accountable and uncomplicated scientific information that is based on the farmers needs. Farmers take samples of their soil for analysis in a state run laboratory. Based on the sample, farmers get information on the soil mineral and water content, fertiliser application methods, and advice on what crops to grow. In the pilot scheme, collected data was inputted into a web-based information system that included the Internet, intranet and GSWAN (Gujarat State Wide Area Network) to build up the state, and national database on soil health. Increasing knowledge on soil management, increased output, and reduced costs for farmers and contributed to Gujarat's agriculture growth rate that was three times the national growth rate in 2009. The success of the scheme has facilitated its implementation at a national level under the Ministry of Agriculture. Each state and union territory is responsible for the set-up and management of the soil testing facilities and maintaining the state soil database so that it is uniform and standardised. The testing, advisory and issuance processes involved are at multi-governance levels involving stakeholders from the private and public sectors. Government approved NGOs, community associations' farmers, the state administration and national administration are all involved in the scheme at different levels. The process begins with the farmers assisted by various NGOs and community groups and involves interactions with more NGOs and state officers at higher levels, as they are responsible for soil sample testing. The impacts of increased global temperatures have had negative effects towards effective soil management techniques in the developing world. Changes in precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme events such as floods and drought have exacerbated issues such as desertification and soil erosion. The effects of such events are further aggravated by resource-deficient farmers and government officials who lack skills to prepare and manage their soils for disasters, and end up relying on relief aid for sustenance. Addressing the Impacts of desertification is a complex multi-level process because of the social, environmental and economic factors. The Republic of India ratified the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 1984, and has since instituted the National Programme to Combat Desertification that utilises an integrated and holistic approach at governing the soil. Through various ministries the national programme aspires to implement the UNCCD by increasing capacity in soil and soil water management, improving access to micro-credit with a focus on women and marginalised groups, promoting alternative energy supplies to reduce reliance on wood increasing soil monitoring and strengthening legislation regarding land management in industrial and mining activities. Impacts of industrialization and urbanization In the developing world, industrialization and urbanization are emerging as significant contributors to land and soil degradation. Lack of sufficient knowledge in soil management and disregard for the environment has been identified as key reasons affecting urban soil degradation. Industrialization alters the chemical aspects of the soil through pollution of heavy metals and effluents. Construction and landfills in urban areas affect soil through compaction and excavation, which affect natural processes such as water purification and storage. In the developing and developing world governance of soils in urban areas requires bespoke policies because of the nature of urban and industrial developments in the cities. In Central Europe, governance of urban soils is facilitated by the urban soil management strategy that aims to design applicable soil management strategies in select European cities. Through networks created with universities and municipal authorities the project aims to research into and develop an interdisciplinary approach to manage urban soils,. In the developing world, urban and industrial soil governance is linked to sustainable development of cities to address urban poverty and responsible land use through effective waste management. Often, developing countries lack resources to implement policies governing settlements and industries, thus the soil and water are often heavily polluted. Urban soil management uses an interdisciplinary approach to protect biodiversity reliant upon the soil and land, reduce pollution from industrial effluents, and increase resilience of the soil to stresses such as compaction from construction. Role of science and technology The global soil map is a global consortium between academic, regional and national scientific institutions coordinated by stakeholders according to the respective regions. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote sensing and emerging technologies a global soil map will be created to represent different soil types. The consortium is led by the ISRIC- World Soil Information, whose mandate to increase knowledge on soils through data collection and dissemination and development of technologies and methodologies for digital soil mapping. GIS is used to display, analyse and collate soil data and processes, and also identify different types of soils through mapping and web-based software. Soil Science is used in tandem with GIS to identify individual soil properties applicable to agricultural and urban soil management. The Soil Health Card Programme in India utilises soil science to advise farmers on fertiliser usage and crop rotations and records the data on a national network which can be used to map different soil types across the country.

The Bhagavad Gita As It Is trial in Russia was a trial that commenced in 2011 about banning the Russian edition of the book Bhagavad Gita As It Is (1968), a translation and commentary of the Hindu holy text Bhagavad Gita, on charges that the commentaries fomented religious extremism. It contains a translation and commentary by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The trial was initiated in June 2011 in Tomsk, Russia, based on an assessment of the book by scholars of Tomsk State University, which concluded that Prabhupada's commentaries incite religious, social, and racial intolerance. The trial caused controversy, which was reported in the Indian, Russian, and international media, as well as on social networks. The Indian government harshly criticized the proposed ban as \\"patently absurd\\" undertaking of \\"ignorant and misdirected or motivated individuals\\". The overwhelmingly wide negative response to the trial forced Russian officials to offer apologies to India, promising the necessary remedial measures to prevent the ban. The trial also sparked public protests and legal actions in India against the proposed ban and drew harsh criticism of the intellectual community in Russia, leading Russian scholars publicly denounced the perpetuation of the trial. The scholars appealed to President Dmitry Medvedev and Premier Vladimir Putin for intervention and warned them of the trial's negative consequences for India-Russia relations and for Russia's international reputation. In December 2011, the judge dismissed the court case, a decision praised by the communities both in India and Russia. On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the judge's ruling, but on March 21, 2012, the appeal court dismissed it, upholding the lower court's verdict. On May 29, 2012 Tomsk region prosecutor's office decided not to challenge the appeal court's verdict. The Bhagavad Gita trial was included in the 2011 annual International Religious Freedom Report of the U.S. Department of State among instances of attempted restrictions of religious freedom by the Russian government.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's translation and commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, a revered scripture for nearly one billion Hindus. The book, a central scripture for Hare Krishna followers, was first published by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in 1968 and has been translated into 80 languages, with over 100 million copies distributed globally till date. According to scholars, the book has never been accused of fomenting extremism before. According to ISKCON, in 2004 and 2005 Moscow state prosecutors found no extremism in the previous edition Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which had only slight stylistic differences from the one on trial. Bhagavad Gita As It Is was presented to a number of world leaders, including the British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said that he \\"keeps a copy of the book in his office.\\" Indian Ambassador to Russia Ajay Malhotra said that Prabhupada's translation of the Gita \\"is one of the best that you can find, because he gives you the words, the meanings and the options to understand it as it was written\\". In November 2011, President of India Pratibha Patil in a message to ISKCON Russia for its 40th anniversary commended the organization for \\"an important role in popularising the noble and eternal message of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita and promoting spiritual harmony in many foreign lands\\". The Bhagavad Gita As It Is trial follows prohibition of a number of publications by groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Scientology. Court case The court case was filed in June 2011 by the public prosecutor of Tomsk Victor Fyodotov. The prosecutor based his plea on an expert analysis of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is commissioned by the FSB. Its authors, three professors of Tomsk State University, Sergei Avanesov, Valery Svistunov, and Valery Naumov, concluded that Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita contain \\"signs of fomenting religious hatred, denigration of human dignity on grounds of gender, race, nationality, language, origins, and religious conviction\\", claim exclusiveness of the Krishna religion, use derogatory terms against those who were not devotees of Krishna, and foster \\"social discord\\", \\"gender, race, nationality, and language\\" discrimination. In addition to this, it was alleged to contain \\"calls to hostile, violent actions against a number of social and religious groups\\". The prosecutor thus charged the book as being in violation of the Federal law № 114-ФЗ (\\"On countering extremist activities\\") and petitioned the court to include Bhagavad Gita As It Is in the Federal List of Extremist Materials, which would ban its printing, possession, and distribution. The Federal List contains over 1,000 works, Hitler's Mein Kampf among them,  considered as fomenting ethnic, social, and religious hatred.Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian state has had problems with populist right wing movements, often organised on nationalist bases. As part of an attempt to reduce this, a Federal List of Extremist Materials is maintained. Texts such as Hitler's Mein Kampf have been added to the list, due to their use by right wing movements. () First, second, and third hearings (August 2011) Federal Judge Galina Butenko studies a copy of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is during the first court hearing. August 12, 2011. In the first, second, and third court hearings held on 12, 18, and 29–30 August 2011 respectively, Federal Judge Galina Butenko dismissed the assessment as inadequate and subjective after the prosecutor's experts said that their opinion in the assessment should be taken as private rather than official. According to Avanesov, the 2010 expert analysis was personally requested by Federal Security officer Dmitry Velikotsky. They also stated that the Bhagavad Gita As It Is did not contain any extremist statements. Two experts invited by the court, N. V. Serebrennikov (Tomsk) and N. N. Karpitsky (Tomsk), also rejected the written expert opinion, maintaining, that while Prabhupada's commentaries used abusive words for those who are not Krishna's devotees, the use of these words did not attempt to create a racial or religious divide, to which the Judge recalled that similarly emotionally charged statements are found in the Bible, like: \\"Don't throw pearls before swine\\". The court noted that, despite some claims of exclusiveness in Prabhupada's commentaries, such statements are characteristic of most religious texts and therefore posed no evidence to support the accusations made against the book. The judge consequently postponed the next hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new assessment of the book by a panel of three professors of Kemerovo State University, including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov. They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not. Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the Bhagavad Gita As It Is and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011. Fourth hearing and judgement (December 2011) On December 28, 2011, Federal Judge Galina Butenko rejected the prosecutor's plea for a ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is. The court's resolution stated that the main criterion for classifying any text as an extremist one is the presence of calls for extremist actions and justifications for such actions, and that the propaganda of exclusiveness found in the book and criticism of political, ideological, and religious convictions is not sufficient grounds for classifying it as such. The decision received wide coverage by the international media.   * Appeal (March 2012) On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office appealed the court's refusal to declare the Russian Bhagavad Gita As It Is an extremist text in a superior court, insisting that the book should be banned, and asking for more time. The prosecutors insisted that the Russian translation of the book be banned as \\"extremist literature.\\" The appeal quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich questioning the translated version, the authenticity of its linguistics as they relate to Hindu scripture, and \\"semantic distortions.\\" The prosecutor general for Tomsk Vasily Voikin said, \\"When we have to deal with such materials, we are just bound to proceed with them. The law opposes extremism. When scholars say the text is of an extremist character, we just have to respond\\". The appeal was scheduled for hearing by the Tomsk regional court on March 6, 2012 but was later rescheduled for March 20. On February 16, 2012, explaining the rationale behind the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman said in an interview during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the Bhagavad Gita As It Is declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, \\"it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [Hinduism]. However, the problem is that the Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason.\\" Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, \\"That is why the prosecutor now has to stand up for his position in the appellate court\\". On February 21, 2012, at a press conference at the Interfax office in Tomsk, anti-cult activist Alexander Dvorkin stated that the \\"manifesto book of the Krishna Consciousness Society, Bhagavad Gita As It Is, is not immediately related to the original, being a free and not quite skilled translation.\\" In response to the appeal, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), along with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), stated that they would fight \\"internationally\\" against any threats to ban the Bhagavad Gita in Russia. Dismissal of appeal (March 2012) Representative of the prosecution said that the district court incorrectly interpreted the definition of \\"extremism\\" when it claimed that it is necessary for it to contain calls to extremist activity which must be expressed in any kind of actions, pointing out that the law prohibits all propaganda that incites any kind of hatred. On March 21, 2012, the appeal court upheld the decision of the lower court, rejecting the prosecutor's petition. On May 29, 2012, Tomsk regional prosecutor Vasily Voykin said that the prosecutor's office will no further appeal the court's refusal to declare Bhagavad Gita As It Is extremist. Reaction to the trial In India =Media= Since December 17, 2011, when Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) issued a report by a staff writer Nallan Chakravarthi Bipindra (NC Bipindra) from Moscow about the proposed Bhagavad Gita ban in Russia, the event became breaking news in the Indian printed and electronic media, with over 600 publications, including editorials, in all major newspapers and TV news channels as of December 27, 2011. =Parliament= On December 19, 2011, Bhartruhari Mahtab, leader of the Biju Janata Dal party, raised up the issue of the Bhagavad Gita trial in the Indian Parliament (Lok Sabha), demanding to know what the Indian government was undertaking to protect \\"the religious rights of Hindus in Russia\\". He also called on the government to \\"impress [this] upon the Russian authorities through diplomatic channels\\". The House Speaker Meira Kumar then turned down requests for speeches on the topic and had to adjourn the session amid protests against the ban of the Gita sparked by Mahtab's statement, as angry members of the Parliament across the party lines strongly condemned the ban, shouting: \\"We will not tolerate an insult to Lord Krishna!\\" The issue was simultaneously raised in Rajya Sabha (the Upper House). This display of political unity surprised the media and prompted a Rajya Sabha member to call the December 19 parliamentary session \\"a golden day in our history when all differences were deleted to express solidarity for Gita, the book of India\\". On December 20, Sushma Swaraj, leader of the largest opposition party BJP demanded that the Indian government declare the Bhagavad Gita a \\"national book\\". Her move seconded by a BJP member of Rajya Sabha, Tarun Vijay, who asked rhetorically \\"Can sun be banned, Himalayas be banned ...?\\" Members across party lines voiced their support. Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha K. Rahman Khan, member of the Indian National Congress, said \\"the entire house agrees with this and joins in condemning this\\". On December 21, a Bharatiya Janata Party delegation led by the party's foreign affairs chief Vijay Jolly met with the Deputy Chief of the Russian Mission in Delhi Denis Alipov to express the party's \\"pain and anguish\\" at the Bhagavad Gita trial and demand that \\"suitable measures\\" be taken by the Russian government to immediately dismiss the court case as baseless. Jolly also expressed surprise that the Russian government allowed the trial to continue for over half a year despite the fact that \\"India–Russia relations is of paramount importance to both countries\\". The delegation also sent through the Russian embassy a copy of the Bhagavad Gita to President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev along with a letter, in which the BJP delegation stressed to the Russian President that the Gita is a book of \\"sublime thoughts\\" that \\"preaches self discipline ... promotes spiritualism and teaches to the mankind the need to fulfill responsibility towards worldly duties\\". =Government= According to officials of the Prime Minister of India's office, \\"[t]his matter is receiving the highest attention and the Indian embassy officials in Moscow have been instructed to follow up the case with the Russian authorities\\", in order to either have the case withdrawn by the state or resolved. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla said that the Indian authorities are \\"apprising the Russian government\\" on the issue. However, members of the Parliament accused the Indian government of inaction. They said that on November 1, ISKCON informed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's principal secretary Pulok Chatterji of the impending court case, urging the government to use \\"some high-level ministerial visits\\" to Moscow, prior to the Prime Minister's own visit December 15–17, to protect the scripture from legal action. The letter, written by ISKCON's Governing Body Commissioner Gopala Krishna Goswami, cited the assessment as stating that \\"Krishna is evil and not compatible with Christian views\\". Despite the advance notice, which was also sent to the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma, and the External Affairs Minister S. M. Krishna, the issue was not discussed with the Russian government during the following six official visits of Indian ministers and top officials to Moscow. Officials who were part of the delegation accompanying the Prime Minister confirmed receipt of the letter to the Indo-Asian News Service. =Ministry of External Affairs= Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna. Following the Parliament's demand for a report from the External Affairs Ministry on the issue, Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna said that ISKCON had been advised to take legal recourse and put the controversy in the light of Russia-India relations. He also stated in Lok Sabha that \\"the Bhagavad-gita is the definitive treatise of Indian thought.\\" =High Court= On December 21, the High Court of Mumbai questioned the Indian government as to the measures it is undertaking to intervene in the possible ban of the Bhagavad Gita and directed the government to consider representing the position of India on the issue before the court in Tomsk. The High Court decision came in response to a Public Interest Litigation filed by two local activists charging the Indian government with inaction in regard to informing the Russian court of the actual purport of the Bhagavad Gita, and that the Indian Embassy's \\"monitoring the matter closely\\" was not sufficient. The court observed Indian Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna's Parliament statement does not imply if Indian government's direct involvement with the December 28 Bhagavad Gita trial hearing and asked the government to submit its reply on the steps taken by January 9. =Religious groups= ISKCON devotees rallying in front of the Russian Consulate in Kolkata (India) demanding to stop the Bhagavad Gita As It Is trial. 19 December 2011 On December 19, dozens of ISKCON followers organized a rally in front of the Russian Consulate in Kolkata, holding up copies of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is in various languages and demanding to stop persecution of their most important scripture. Similar protest marches were held in New Delhi and Chandigarh. Gopal Krishna Goswami, ISKCON's Governing Body Commissioner for India, said that ISKCON members are poised to intensify their public protests across the globe if their scripture is banned. He said, \\"I hope the Indian government will be able to pressurize the Russian government and the matter gets solved legally. It's a book of peace and there's nothing extreme in it. Holy scriptures shouldn't be taken to court\\". On December 21, a highly respected Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband issued a statement signed by its vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani in defense of the Bhagavad Gita, in which he condemned \\"Russian diktat against the Hindu holy scripture\\". Nomani also called accusations of the Gita of extremism \\"totally baseless and highly objectionable\\", maintaining that the proposed ban is tantamount to violation of the freedom of conscience \\"enshrined\\" in the Indian Constitution, and called on boldly countering the \\"Russian highhandedness\\". Maulana Khalid Rashid, head of Firangi Mahal, another Islamic center of higher education in Lucknow, also condemned what he called \\"Russian arrogance\\" and called on Muslims to support Hindu followers while appealing to the Indian government \\"to take a firm stance so that such blasphemous interference is not attempted in future\\". On December 22, 2011, Isai Mahasangh organization representing Christians in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh addressed the President of India Pratibha Patil and the Pope Benedict XVI, asking for their intervention in the Bhagavad Gita trial. An Isai Mahasangh delegation conveyed their memorandum to the President through Madhya Pradesh governor Ram Naresh Yadav, and to the Pope through the Holy See embassy in New Delhi. Jerry Paul, General Secretary of Isai Mahasangh, stated that it was clear from the court case against the Gita that \\"the Russians are not aware of the importance of the Gita, the teachings and values it upholds and above all its place in the life of millions of Indians\\". A prominent Hindu teacher Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in his Twitter called the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita in Russia \\"an unpardonable loss for the people of Russia\\" and, countering accusations of the book of \\"extremism\\" and \\"intolerance\\" opined that it was the move to ban the scripture that showed intolerance and bred terrorism rather than the Gita's teachings. =Hindu activists= On December 20, 2011, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) threatened to protest outside Russian missions in India if Russia effects the ban. VHP General Secretary Pravin Togadia said in a statement that the Bhagavad Gita is held sacred by all Hindus and that its principles have universal appeal and \\"touch humanity so very deeply\\", citing Albert Einstein's fascination with the book as an example. Togadia also warned Russian authorities that Indians will be forced to boycott Russian goods, plants, and offices in India in response to the Gita ban in Russia. A group of VHP members held a protest march in front of the Russian consulate in Mumbai. VHP and Bajrang Dal activists also staged protest in Chandigarh, calling on the Indian government to protect the rights of Hindus in Russia and denouncing the proposed ban. On December 23, dozens of activists of Rashtrawadi Sena, a hardline Hindu group, burned a Russian flag and shouted anti-Russian slogans during a protest march in New Delhi over the proposed ban. Rashtrawadi Sena president Jai Bhagwan Goyal called the Gita \\"the most pious book of the nation\\" and said there will be no tolerance for insulting it. The protesters also sent a memorandum to Indian President Pratibha Patil, and to the Russian embassy, demanding to avert the ban. They also urged the President to declare the Bhagavad Gita a \\"national scripture\\" in order to prevent such insults in the future. A similar protest along with the burning of a Russian flag was held on December 26 by activists of the right-wing Hindu organisation Shiv Sena in Amritsar. In a similar move, a Jammu unit of Sri Ram Sena appealed to Indian and Russian authorities to forestall the impending Gita ban \\"for the betterment of Indo-Russia relations\\". =Atheists and rationalists= Sanal Edamaruku, the president of the Indian Rationalist Association, opposed the ban calling for the right to read any literature under the freedom of expression, even if he considered the book to be promoting the caste system. Similarly, Dr Jayagopal, the founder of the Atheist Society of India, opposed the ban, in spite of considering the book to be undemocratic and against the spirit of the constitution. He also suspected that the Russian Orthodox Church may have been behind the ban. Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of the Tarksheel Society, also opposed this move, but admitted that Russians may have been offended by the book and their sentiments should be respected. On the other hand, Dalit Marxist scholar Chittibabu Padavala supported the ban, as he considered Gita to be promoting inequalities from the birth unlike other religious texts. =Russian community in Goa= On December 21, 2011, the Russian community in Goa has issued a statement condemning the proposed ban on the Bhagavad Gita in Russia. Speaking on behalf of the 150-strong community, Russian consulate in Goa Vikram Varma stated: \\"The Russian community in Goa as a whole condemns the possibility of a ban on any of India's ancient scriptures. It is felt by the Russian community in Goa as well as by a large section of Russians visiting Goa that the depth of knowledge and wisdom offered by the Bhagavad Gita cannot be understood by a casual reader. It is well accepted that all the ancient Hindu scriptures are of tremendous importance not only to India but to the rest of the world.\\" =Society= The trial sparked community protests in India. On December 16, 2011, an online petition to stop the Bhagavad Gita trial was launched, and by December 22 more than 45,000 people from all over the world, mostly from India. The topic has gone viral on social networks, with the hashtag #Gita becoming a leading trend on Indian Twitter. Noted poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar, for instance, twitted: \\"Banning Gita ? Have they lost their minds. This great book of wisdom belongs not only to Hindus but to the whole humanity\\". Member of Parilament Naveen Jindal wrote in his blog, \\"I welcome the statement by the Russian ambassador to India condemning the Bhagavad Gita controversy\\". Janata Dal party leader Subramanian Swamy wrote on Twitter: \\"Happy to inform that Russian Ambassador will tell my daughter on TV that he is a student of Gita and Russia will rectify matters soon. Ok?\\" and Bollywood celebrity Farah Khan suggested in a retweet: \\"The Russians have banned the Gita. In retaliation let's ban something equally sacrosanct to them: vodka\\". Prominent social activists from a broad societal spectrum also condemned the trial. A vocal anti- fundamentalist Ram Puniyani of the EKTA Committee for Communal Amity called the move to ban the Bhagavad Gita translation \\"irrational\\", suggesting that possible questionable passages should be analyzed and debated, but they do not warrant the legal action. Former president of the Students Islamic Movement of India Shahid Badr Falahi said he was \\"completely against\\" this or any other bans of religious books, calling on \\"equal opinion on issues pertaining to every religion\\". Ram Madhav, national executive member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh termed the attempted ban \\"a shameful act\\" planned by some \\"fundamentalist groups in Russia\\" to portray the Bhagavad Gita as a \\"terror manual\\". He emphasized the Gita's status as one of the most sacred texts respected in all religions and expressed hope that the Russian government will help stop the trial. In Russia The Russian society appears to be embarrassed by the court case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, carrying reports titled like \\"Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk\\". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document. =Indian diaspora and ISKCON= Hare Krishna followers, who count over 100,000 members and over 100 centers in Russia, expressed fear that the trial on their main scripture, if upheld by the court, will be followed by a ban of their entire movement and religion nationwide. The 15,000-strong Hindu community in Russia shared the apprehension. On November 1, ISKCON leader in India Gopal Krishna Goswami appealed to the Indian government asking to intervene and resolve the impending trial by bringing it up with the Russian authorities during Indian official visits to Moscow. Hindu followers in Russia from India, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Nepal and other countries held an emergency meeting, at which they set up the Hindu Council of Russia meant to protect their interests in Russia, and elected Sadhu Priya Das, and India-born member of ISKCON, as its chairman. Das said that they were seeking opinion of the Russian Ombudsman and experts from Moscow and St. Petersburg, the main centers of Indology in Russia, and that they trusted the Russian judiciary, hoping that \\"finally the truth will prevail\\". ISKCON members alleged that the court case was instigated by the Russian Orthodox Church in order to limit their activities in Russia. =Scholars= Islamic studies scholar Roman Silantyev opined that Prabhupada's interpretation \\"has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism\\" and that his commentaries contained statements that can be considered extremist. On November 28, at a round table organized by Russian newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets, scientists and members of the Russian Academy of Sciences along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, \\"there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor is an insult to the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations.\\" Sergey Serebryanny, the head of the Institute of High Humanitarian Studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities and an Indologist, said Russian courts give the term ‘extremism’ a very broad interpretation, which allows them to label as extremist anything going against the authorities, whether secular or religious. He also opined that, while Prabhupada supplemented his version of the Bhagavad Gita with his own ideas and beliefs, his followers \\"have the same right for the freedom of conscience as believers of other religious confessions that observe the laws of the Russian Federation\\". Russian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences wrote an article severely criticizing the court case over the Bhagavad Gita, which \\"is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live\\". She reminded that in Europe, the Gita was \\"admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy\\" and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, \\"nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia\\". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism against Prabhupada's \\"copious\\" commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita are fallacious and based on a \\"primitive\\" screening of the religious text for negative words (such as \\"fool,\\" \\"enemy,\\" \\"demon, \\"kill\\"). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when \\"specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts\\". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards \\"a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna\\", ISKCON followers have the right to practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy book to Mein Kampf, should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, \\"people will again start being burned alive\\". Historian and full professor of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined that the move to ban the Gita was \\"contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation\\". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, \\"one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts as to whether the local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature\\". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the Bhagavad Gita Volodin replied that \\"all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never have come up with a more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world\\". =Government= In an interview by CNN-IBN, Russia's ambassador to India Alexander Kadakin called Bhagavad Gita \\"the source of wisdom and inspiration not only for the people of India but for Russia as well and the world.\\" and commended the Indian Parliament and government for their resolute stance on the Bhagavad Gita trial in Russia, opining that both countries nations, being secular, democratic, and multi-cofessional, \\"should not allow such things to happen\\". He assured that the Russian government is using all means to end the Bhagavad Gita scandal and added that he thought it \\"categorically inadmissible\\" to take any sacred scriptures \\"for examination to ignorant people\\" to the courts rather than to academic forums Kadakin ruled out the possibility of the Russian government directly influencing the court decision, but added that the government still \\"can do something\\" and called the instigators of the trial \\"madmen\\", whose \\"madness should be stopped.\\" He also answered a question of a possible apology to the people of India by the Russian government, opining that since it was not the Russian government who started the case, it \\"has nothing to apologize for, [but] can only testify and reiterate the love and affection and highest esteem our nation has for Bhagvat Gita.\\" On December 27, 2011, after a meeting with the Foreign Minister of India S. M. Krishna, at which Krishna reiterated India's grave concerns over the issue, Kadakin told reporters that the Russian government will do everything within its powers to prevent the ban. He said that, while it was a judicial process, the Russian government can ask the people of Russia \\"to express our love and admiration for the Gita, ... that [assurance] you can get from anyone in Russia\\". He also added that he had read the Gita and thought it was a great scripture of the world, and maintained that \\"no holy scripture, whether it is Bible, Quran or Gita, can be brought to a court\\". According to the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla, a top Russian minister also \\"expressed regrets\\" about the situation. Russian Chief Director for Human Rights Vladimir Lukin stated that the attempt to ban Bhagavad Gita As It Is amounted to \\"infringement on the constitutional right to the freedom of consciousness\\" and that it was \\"unacceptable\\" to ban the Bhagavad Gita As It Is written by ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in Russia, as he said it was a \\"globally respected book\\". As the Ombudsman for Russia, Vladimir Lukun took the Bhagavad Gita court case under his special control and will testify in the court on December 28 asking to dismiss the charges. At a December 22, 2011 press briefing, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich attempted to clarify a number of points seemingly misunderstood by his Indian colleagues: \\"In June this year Tomsk prosecutors instigated legal proceedings against the third edition of the Russian translation of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' with a view to have it added to the federal list of extremist materials. I would like to stress that the trial is not about 'Bhagavad Gita', a religious philosophical poem, which forms part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata and is one of the most famous texts of the ancient Hindu literature. In Russia, the book was first published in Russian in 1788 and then went through many editions in different years and in various translations. The Tomsk court case is about classifying as extremist material the Russian-language edition of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is', written in 1968 by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The work represents an authorized translation of the original from Sanskrit into English. The book was translated into Russian in 1984. As evident from the materials available, the complaints of law enforcement are not so much about the text of the book itself, whose double translation suffers from semantic distortions, as about the author's comments which were regarded as falling under Article 13 of the Federal Law 'On Counteracting Extremist Activity'.\\" Nelly Krechetova, Human Rights Ombudsman of Tomsk region, has termed the trial \\"absurd\\". Speaking on the Echo of Moscow radio station, she said, \\"This book is considered sacred by more than a billion people the world over, and in Russia itself the book has been in circulation for 20 years.\\" She continued that there was no manifest incident of extremism caused by the dissemination of the book. A ban on the book, she said, would amount to \\"violation of constitutional rights of citizens to freedom of conscience and faith.\\" International Associated Press reported that the attempt to ban Bhagavad Gita As It Is angered Hindus around the world. The court case evoked protests by US-based Hindu activists, who called the trial \\"an attack on religious freedom and belittling of the entire Hindu community.\\" The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) based in Washington, DC expressed \\"shock and outrage\\" over the attempted ban. Subhag Shukla, HAF managing director, called the move by Russian prosecutors \\"indefensible\\" and \\"a draconian attempt to restrict the religious freedom of Hindus in Russia\\". Shukla added that, \\"[b]y promoting a narrow and intolerant agenda that demonizes a sacred scripture revered by more than one billion Hindus worldwide, Russian officials are acting contrary to the principles of a free democratic society\\". HAF members conveyed their concerns in an official statement to the Russian embassy in Washington, DC, requesting a follow-up meeting to monitor the situation, and urged the Russian judiciary and government \\"to uphold the basic rights of their Hindu citizens\\". They also warned that \\"Any court ruling or law that would prohibit the Bhagavad Gita or any other Hindu religious literature would be considered a direct attack on the civil liberties of Russia's Hindu community and an affront to Hindus throughout the world\\". In Kathmandu, Nepal, a consortium of the country's Hindu organizations, Rastriya Dharma Sabha Nepal, condemned the proposed ban, urging the government and the Parliament to support the Bhagavad Gita. Chairman of the Dharma Sabha Madhav Bhattarai also requested the Parliament to discuss the issue and address it with the Russian government and embassy in Nepal. Another protest was expressed by a Nepali Shreemadbhagawat Publicity Service Association (SPSA), which emphasized that rather than being extremist, the Gita \\"guides one for the self-discipline and responsibility to human duties\\" and informed of plans to hold rallies against the potential ban. The United States Department of State in its annual International Religious Freedom Report for 2011 cited the Bhagavad Gita trial among instances of \\"selectively enforced existing legal restrictions on religious freedom\\" by the Russian government. The report quoted the Russian Ombudsperson for Human Rights Vladimil Lukin as saying that \\"the struggle with terrorism is a struggle with real terrorist planning and creation of groups, not with the interpretation of ancient holy books, of whatever faith\\". Reaction to the appeal Scholars On February 24, 2012, Russian religious scholars and experts held a nationwide conference Bhagavad Gita in history and modern society at the Tomsk State University. They said they were \\"perplexed\\" over the Tomsk prosecutor's office's continued attempts to have the Bhagavad Gita as It Is declared extremist. Chief researcher of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, indologist Irina Glushkova said in an interview with RIA Novosti that there are various schools of Hinduism \\"and each school is based on its own scripture or commentary\\", adding that \\"from this point of view Bhagavad Gita As It Is has the right to exist as any other commentary or scripture. It is a fundamental principle of Hinduism and there is no any other Hinduism whoever says it, Dvorkin or the Tomsk prosecutor's office\\". She also stated it was \\"impermissible\\" to subject the Bhagavad Gita As It Is to a criminal court trial, because \\"it is inseparable from the original Bhagavad Gita, both being parts of the same culture\\". Philosopher Tatyana Lyubimova, chief researcher of the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that most ancient scriptures, including the Bhagavad Gita, were revised or adapted over the years so that modern people could better understand them. On March 12, 2012, a group of twenty leading Russian philosophers, orientologists, and philologists published an open letter addressing both Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and the Russian Prime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin, with copies sent to Russia's Presecutor General, Ministry of Justice, and Public Chamber, urging the ruling tandem to take the Bhagavad Gita As It Is court case under their \\"personal control\\". The scholars said they were alarmed by the Tomsk prosecutor's attempting to overrule the earlier court's rejection of the extremest charges against the book, and filing a modified petition asking the court to ban only Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries and exempting the original text from the charges of extremism. The scholars criticized the prosecutor's indictment of the commentaries with extremism as \\"untrue and contrary to the traditions of Hinduism\\". They emphasized that, contrary to the prosecutor's accusations, the Bhagavad Gita As It Is was considered sacred by a section of Hindu followers as belonging to the commentary tradition of Bengali Vaishnavism, \\"one of the most popular branches of Hinduism\\", and \\"did not contain any signs of extremism and did not incite hatred on ethnic, religious or any other grounds\\". The scholars also warned Russia's top leaders that the trial \\"discredits Russia's cultural and democratic credentials in the eyes of the civilized world and is driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations\\". ISKCON Maxim Osipov, a representative of ISKCON's Governing Body Commission, said that the commentary to Bhagavad Gita As It Is is \\"a precise and clear reflection\\" on the religious tradition taught by Prabhupada, the founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Reaction to the court decision In India \\"I welcome the verdict of the Honourable District Court in Tomsk today, which has dismissed the appeal petition in the Bhagavad Gita case. It is good that the decision of the lower trial court in this matter has been reaffirmed. I trust that this issue is now conclusively behind us\\", said Ajai Malhotra, Indian Ambassador to the Russian Federation. \\"We appreciate this sensible resolution of a sensitive issue and are glad to put this episode behind us. We also appreciate the efforts of all friends in Russia who made this outcome possible. This demonstrates yet again that the people of India and Russia have a deep understanding of each other’s cultures and will always reject any attempt to belittle our common civilizational values\\", said Indian foreign ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash. In Russia =Human Rights Commissioner= On April 11, 2012 Vladimir Lukin, the Human Rights Commissioner of Russia, \\"warned against court decisions on Bhagavad Gita texts based on judges' opinions rather than expert examinations.\\" Lukin stated that the \\"Tomsk [judges] considered something they should not have… It should have been up to theologians and historians.\\" Lukin noted that \\"Winston Churchill once said: Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn't misuse it.\\" =Religions= On December 28, 2011, the day the Tomsk court dismissed extremism charges against the Bhagavad Gita As It Is, director of the Human Rights Center of the World Russian People's Council Roman Silantyev said that the examination of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is as extremist was accurate, and that \\"it has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism.\\" He also called Krishna devotees in Russia marginal pseudo-Hindu cult members with \\"extremely nasty reputation\\" and condemned their charitable food distribution programs saying it was unacceptable for Orthodox, Muslim, Jews and Buddhist believers. On January 18, 2012, a number of Russia's Islamic leaders denounced Hare Krishna followers in Russia as a \\"destructive cult\\" and called on the Russian authorities not to yield to the Indian pressure in regard of the proposed banning of the Bhagavad Gita As It. Mufti Muhammedgali Huzin, head of All-Russian Muslim Board executive committee, said, \\"I believe that Russian authorities should be principally tough in the question and shouldn't give way to any provocations and pressure. I think that Russia can do without semiliterate interpretations of ancient epos\\". First deputy chairman of the Central Spiritual Board of Russian Muslims Mufti of Moscow and Russia's Central Region Albir Krganov proposed to \\"pay the debt\\" to Krishna devotees in Russia for their charitable food distribution by \\"delivering nutritious Halal canned beef to starving Krishna devotees of India. We are ready to personally distribute this meat to Russian Krishnaites\\". However, other all-Russia Islamic umbrella organizations rejected their statements as \\"fortunately\\" not representing the opinion of a majority of Russian Muslims of the issue. On January 27, 2012, a group of Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the premises of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was in retaliation for the burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which they called an \\"anti-Russian … disgraceful act\\" and \\"one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court\\". On January 31, 2012, the head of the Traditional Buddhist Sangha of Russia Andrey Baljirov called the Indian authorities who asked the Russian government to help avert the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is \\"misinformed\\" and \\"exerting pressure\\" and spoke against the proposed construction of the Krishna temple in Moscow because \\"there are Buddhist followers in Moscow who do not have a temple yet\\".

It uses the LiveArea as its graphical shell. The PlayStation Vita system software has one optional add-on component, the PlayStation Mobile Runtime Package. The system is built on a Unix-base which is derived from FreeBSD and NetBSD.https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/system-updates/ps-vita/ Technology User interface The LiveArea is the name of the graphical user interface of the PlayStation Vita system software developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. The interface features a new touch-based screen and acts like a hub page and allows users to hop between different parts of the game space.IGN - NGP's LiveArea Detailed The eighth-generation PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV consoles use LiveArea as the graphical shell instead of the previous XrossMediaBar (XMB) interface, which was used by Sony's seventh-generation video game consoles such as PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3. PlayStation 4, Sony's eighth-generation home video game console however uses neither LiveArea nor XrossMediaBar as its graphical shell, but rather utilizes a user interface called PlayStation Dynamic Menu.PS4 dynamic menu featured live video feeds of friends games & game-specific messaging The PlayStation Vita system software uses LiveArea as its user interface, which includes various social networking features via the PlayStation Network. Users can select the icon for a game or an application on the home screen to open the LiveArea screen for that game or application in PlayStation Vita or PlayStation TV. As a new feature of PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV's LiveArea, latest game information such as downloadable contents are shown on the LiveArea screen for that game. In addition, by scrolling down the game's LiveArea, the \\"Activity\\" of other users who are playing the same game can be checked instantly. Cooperation with home consoles The PlayStation Vita (and the PlayStation TV which uses the same system software as the PlayStation Vita) supports a feature called Remote Play with Sony's home video game consoles such as the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4. It allows the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 to transmit its video and audio output to a PlayStation Vita. However, unlike Remote Play between the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation 4 which is well-integrated, Remote Play between the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation 3 is only supported by a \\"select\\" few PS3 titles and results were often laggy. Besides, the PlayStation Vita can be used as a second screen device for the PS4 (and for PS3, but only supported by very few games such as Class of Heroes 2G) for streaming content directly from the console to the PlayStation Vita. Also, for users having both the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation 3, it is possible to share media files videos, music and images between them by transferring multimedia files directly from the PlayStation Vita to the PlayStation 3, or vice versa. Updates of the PlayStation Vita system software can also be downloaded to PS Vita devices via a PS3 system. Furthermore, a service called Cross-Buy can be used which allows players to buy certain games that support this feature one time, and play them in both Sony platforms. Minecraft and Terraria are examples of such games, and their saved worlds are transferable between the consoles. Minecraft is no longer cross buy as of February 25, 2016. There is also a feature called Cross-Play (or Cross-Platform Play) covering any PlayStation Vita software title that can interact with a PlayStation 3 or a PlayStation 4 software title. Different software titles use Cross-Play in different ways. For example, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a title supporting the Cross-Play feature, and the PS3 version of the game can be controlled using the PS Vita system. Internet features Although the PlayStation Vita console can function without any Internet connection, it will provide more functionality when it is connected to the Internet. For example, users may download updates to the system software from Internet as well as playing online when the Internet is properly connected. Additionally, with an Internet connection, the PlayStation Vita system allows users to access a variety of PlayStation Network (PSN) services such as the PlayStation Store and the PlayStation Plus subscription service, and games and other content may be purchased from these services. Applications such as the Live from PlayStation app, as well as various video streaming apps, also require an Internet connection to function properly. The \\"Browser\\" is a preinstalled app on the PlayStation Vita for browsing the World Wide Web. Although not very different from web browsing on a PlayStation Portable, the browser itself has been improved over the PSP's version, which is intended to result in a less difficult experience. The browser application does not have tabs, but users can have up to 8 separate browser windows open at once, and can also save images from websites to the PS Vita memory card by touching and holding on the image until a menu appears. However, while users can use the web browser while playing a game or watching a video, the display of some content will be limited; as a result, it is recommended to exit any open game or video before performing more intensive browsing tasks. Furthermore, while the PS Vita's web browser supports HTML5, cookies and JavaScript, it does not support Adobe Flash, unlike the PSP's web browser. Another application preinstalled on the PlayStation Vita at launch was \\"Maps,\\" which displayed online maps when an Internet connection was available. However, it was removed by Sony via a system update, along with the \\"near\\" feature in 2015.YouTube app and Maps will be removed from PS Vita Multimedia features Like many other video game consoles, the PlayStation Vita is capable of photo, audio, and video playback in a variety of formats, and the built-in cameras can be used to take photos or videos. However, unlike Sony's home consoles such as the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4, it is not possible to play Blu-ray or DVD movies on the PlayStation Vita since it lacks of an optical disc drive, or a UMD drive as with the PlayStation Portable. However, users can transfer movies in a supported format from and to a PlayStation Vita system, and there are videos for download at the PlayStation Store. Also, users can transfer content that is playing or displayed on a PlayStation Vita system to a PlayStation TV system, allowing them to view the content on their televisions instead of PS Vita screens. The following multimedia formats are supported on a PS Vita or a PS TV system: * Videos: MP4 SP, MP4 AVC / MP4 H.264 Baseline, Main, or High Profile Level 4.1 * Photos: JPEG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, PNG * Music: MP3, MP3 Surround, WAV, WMA 9, MP4 Audio, MPEG-4 Part 3, AAC / AAC Low Complexity (unprotected) Furthermore, there are a few entertainment applications available for download on the PlayStation Store for the PS Vita and the PS TV system. Sony announced at Gamescom 2011 applications like Netflix would become available via the PlayStation Store. Additional applications available for download include Music Unlimited, Flickr, Nico Nico, TuneIn Radio, Qello, Crunchyroll, Crackle, Hulu Plus, Redbox Instant and YouTube,ps vita app list although many of them are not compatible with the PS TV at launch.PlayStation TV's Video App Selection Is Rather Sparse Right Now  Backward compatibility  Similar to the early PlayStation 3 consoles which were compatible with PlayStation 2 titles, the PlayStation Vita is backwards-compatible with most PlayStation Portable games. However, the PlayStation Vita lacks the PlayStation Portable's UMD drive and Sony had confirmed that PSP owners would not be able to transfer their physical UMD games across to a PS Vita system. This means that users will only be able to play PSP games on their PS Vita that they originally downloaded via the PlayStation Network rather than bought on disc.PSP UMD discs not transferable to Vita When playing a PSP game on a PS Vita system, the PS Vita's dual analog sticks are supported on PSP games; the right stick can be set to mimic either the D-pad, the left stick, the L and R buttons, or the face button cluster of the original PSP system. The graphics for PSP releases are up-scaled, with an optional bilinear filter to reduce pixelation. Besides PlayStation Portable games, the PlayStation Vita is also backwards- compatible with the majority of titles from other platforms such as PSone Classics, PlayStation minis, and PlayStation Mobile games. PSone Classic titles were not compatible with the PS Vita at launch, but they gradually became available for the PS Vita since system software update 1.80, released on August 28, 2012. PlayStation Mobile games were originally intended to be compatible with both PlayStation Vita, PlayStation TV, and certain devices that run the Android operating system, but PlayStation Mobile 2.00 released in 2014 would only target PlayStation Vita and (optionally) PlayStation TV.

His followers were known as Stephanites and were known for advocating sola gratia (salvation by grace alone through faith, not of works), soli Deo gloria (veneration to God alone and not to religious icons and saints) and for their asceticism. Over the course of a century of persecution by clergy and five consecutive kings following Zara Ya'iqob, membership in the Stephanites movement dwindled and vanished. Estifanos was a proponent of soli Deo gloria, which placed him at odds with Ethiopian Orthodox Church authorities and Emperor Zara Ya'iqob as his teachings deemed prostration as an act reserved to God alone and, hence, that the teaching of The Church of Ethiopia that prostration for the veneration of saints, angelic beings, religious icons and the monarch (Zara Ya'iqob) was wrong. His reformation movement took place close to seventy years prior to European Protestant reformation, but the similar tenets that it has with Protestantism and the exponential growth of Evangelicals membership in Ethiopia in the late 20th century has sparked a new interest in his life and that of his followers. Early life and monasticism Estifanos was born sometime around 1380 CE in a small village called Sebuha in the Tigray province of northern Ethiopia. His father, Berhanemeskel, was a renowned warrior soldier who died prior to Estifanos' birth. As a result, Estifanos was raised in his uncle's household and, in expectation that he would grow up to be a soldier, he was named Hadegeanbesa (English translation: reminiscent of a lion). However, during his adolescence he developed religious aspirations and, despite his mother's and relatives' urging, he ran away to join liturgical school. Estifanos was ordained a deacon at age 18 by the hands of Bishop Abuna Bartalomiwos at the liturgical school that he was attending. Following a long- held custom, he returned to his family once more following his ordination, said his farewell and went on a religious pilgrimage which led him to join the Qoyetsa monastery under Abbot Samuel. He acquired the name Estifanos during his ordination as a monk and obediently followed a path of extreme self-denial and asceticism in the hope of obtaining salvation. Ordained a priest at age 30, Estifanos pushed the boundaries of religious observance by fasting more, praying longer and taking pilgrimages to holy sites in a desperate attempt to find fulfillment and eternal life. Reformation It is generally held that it was a hermit by the name of Abba Gebre Nazrawi who had fled religious persecution in the province of Shoa due to his teachings on sola gratia, that first introduced Estifanos to the teaching that salvation is obtained by the grace of God through faith in the redemptive work of Jesus' crucifixion, and not of works. It was this notion that Estifanos took from Gebre Nazrawi and expounded through scriptural studies and meditations giving the hermit a theological framework for the teaching. Following his convictions, Estifanos started (date unknown) proclaiming the doctrine to fellow monks and then to the general public. Estifanos rapidly gained a number of followers, and despite his teaching on sola gratia, he developed an elaborate teaching on good works not as prerequisites for salvation but rather as fruits of salvation, that led him to denounce alcohol and promote self-denial to an extent that his opponents in the monastery could not keep up with. He developed a network of evangelists to carry out missionary work such as distributing his literature and manuscripts of the Bible and helping the needy. His lifestyle coupled with his teaching drew an ever growing number of adherents which were referred to as dekika estifa (students of Estifanos) or simply Stephanites. Growth and persecution The first wave of persecution started at the monastery when the abbot, fuelled by the growing influence of Estifanos, had his leading disciple Abukerezun expelled from the monastery and Estifanos imprisoned on charges of heresy for three years. During his imprisonment, his disciple Abukerezun started a congregation of Stephanites to which Estifanos became a leader upon his release. In a few years the Stephanites had grown into nine congregations and fifteen sub-congregations, which were all actively engaged in the proliferation of Estifanos' literature and bible manuscripts and in agricultural projects for the impoverished. Although many aspects of Estifanos' life have been lost, it is known that it was during this period that he developed numerous doctrines which were at odds with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church including: #Rejection of prostration to religious icons. #Rejection of prostration to saints and angelic beings. #Rejection of prostration to the emperor Zera Ya'iqob. #Rejection of the claim of solomonic dynasty. #Rejection of tabot (replicas of the Ark of the Covenant). #Reorganization of Church buildings from being Sanctuary Temples to assembly halls. #Rejection of prayer to dead saints and angelic beings. Emperor Zara Ya'iqob, who was himself an ex-monk and a professed religious scholar, took personal offense to Estifanos, especially being denied prostration from Estifanos was an area that aggravated the Emperor and resulted in Estifanos' numerous arrests and the persecution of the Stephanites. The persecutions range from martyrdom to losing fingers, limbs, tongues and other body parts. The most severe affliction came in the form of peeling off Stephanites' skin to inflict and maximize pain. There is a legend which suggests that the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church started the tradition of making the sign of the cross whenever one goes past a church in an attempt to distinguish Stephanites from among them for persecution. Death Hungry and exhausted from the torture that he received over a seven- month imprisonment, Estifanos died in prison due to lack of care and treatment around 1450. His gedel (Book of Acts) enunciates that he cried out Christ's name three times before his death. The emperor, enraged that he did not get the chance to inflict more pain upon Estifanos while he was alive, forbade his burial, and Estifanos' body was exposed for two years until finally his dried bones were buried at a nearby church. Stephanites Following the death of Estifanos, many Stephanites were captured, tortured and killed. Others were forced to renounce their affiliation with Estifanos and his teachings by the threat of death and some were sent away in exile. The emperor Zera Ya'iqob, upon not receiving prostration from the imprisoned Stephanites, ordered that the Stephanites be killed and that Estifanos' remains be dug up and burned. The cycle of persecution continued well into the 16th century, until the entire sect was eliminated. Theology Due to the burning of Estifanos' literature and books, we do not have the full volume of his teachings. The book The Ge'ez Acts of Abba Estifanos of Gwendagwende is one of the few surviving books from that era describing in detail the teachings and practices of Estifanos and the Stephanites. There are strong parallels in the teachings and practices of Estifanos with the early Protestant reformers. He removed the banner of monks and celebrated Christian liberty, he held a traditional view of the Trinity, stressed on holiness, and it has also been suggested at some levels he has thought and believed in sola scriptura (bible alone) even though he didn't use the exact words to formulate his teaching on the subject. Myth The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church devotional book called Teamere Mariam (The Miracles of Mary), composed during the time of emperor Zera Ya'iqob, has a section dedicated to Estifanos and the Stephanites. It states that after the Stephanites were killed for denying prostration to the King, The Most Blessed Mary and the wooden cross, God in satisfaction sent down a glowing light upon a mountain for which they named the place Debre Berhan (The Mount of Light). Legacy The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims that Estifanos was a heretic, but he is revered as a saint and a martyr by most Ethiopian Evangelicals, who also view him as the original leader of their movement and have in a number of books admired him and his teachings. There has also been an academic interest into his life and that of his followers in recent years. Some have called him \\"the first African Protestant\\" due to his teachings, but in the end his enduring legacy is as the person that started a reform movement over seventy years before the Protestant reformation.

Each time, the Assembly failed to act and referred interested members to the ABCFM.Brown pg. 11-12 Eventually, in 1837, with a vote of 108 to 29 by the General Assembly, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (BFM) was founded.Brown pg. 12-13 The BFM chose to set up missions in China for four main reasons – its size, its peoples’ ignorance of the true God, its one written language, and its peoples’ believed openness towards the Gospel.5th Annual Report, Western Foreign Missionary Society, Source 4 in Brown Chapter 1 The Presbyterian missionaries were faced with China’s ethnocentrism, its three main religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, and the widespread usage of opium.Brown Chapter 1  Singapore and the First Opium War  With the formation of the BFM, missionaries were sent to Singapore to establish a mission as China was not open for foreign residence.Brown pg. 24-25 And yet, with the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking the BFM closed its mission in Singapore and eventually opened a mission at Xiamen, one of the five treaty ports established by the Treaty of Nanking.Brown pg. 25-26 Plans were also made and missions opened in Ningbo, Canton, and Shanghai.Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Christianity  Second Opium War and Beyond Prior to the Second Opium War of 1856, and the resulting Treaty of Tientsin of 1858, missionaries had been confined to the coast of China. With the signing of the Treaty of Tientisn, however, more treaty ports were opened and missionaries were finally allowed to enter the interior.Brown pg. 42-43 Furthermore, American missionaries were protected from harassment by the terms of their nation’s treaty.Covell pg. 273, Source 7 in Brown Chapter 3 As such, missions were established in various Chinese cities, such as Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Peking.Brown pg. 72-75 In the early 1860s, a mission was set up in Dengzhou, Shandong that would, along with the mission at Chefoo, eventually provide the foundation for the opening of the mission at Weixian.Stanley pg. 117-118  State of Missionary Medicine  Modern, or westernized, medicine was first introduced in China by Christian missionaries in the 1830s. The first fully trained medical missionary in China was Dr. Peter Parker, a Protestant. He established a clinic in Guangzhou where he treated a variety of simple illnesses.Lazich pg. 66-67Chen 18 In contrast, the American Presbyterians would establish their first dispensary in Guangzhou in 1854 via the work of Dr. John G. Kerr.Stanley pg. 117 During this time period, modern medicine was largely regarded for its potential for Christian proselytization. Its presence was largely rooted in the urban centers where missionaries tended to be. It was not until later that modern medicine would find its way into the interior of China. And yet, the impact of westernized medicine was still relatively tiny as traditional Chinese medicine was still dominant during this time period.Chen pg. 16-18 In this time period, missionary medicine typically followed five characteristic stages. Stage one was known as “pillbox” medicine, which meant that untrained medical missionaries provided simple rudimentary care. Stage two involved the hiring of trained medical professionals. Stage three was characterized by medicine being recognized as a necessary component to spreading religion. Stage four involved the training of nationals in modern medicine. Finally, stage five was typically characterized by a need for preventative medicine and an emphasis on public health.Brown pg. 222-223  Evangelist Years – 1880s-1890s  In 1881, Reverend Robert Mateer, Reverend John Laughlin, Annie Laughlin, and Dr. and Mrs. Horace Smith, all missionaries commissioned by the BFM, set sail for China. After studying Chinese, they were able to procure a plot of land from a local farmer outside of the city of Weixian. This land would serve as the basis for the founding of the Wexian mission station.Stanley pg. 117-118  The Arrival of the First Doctors  The first doctor, Dr. Horace R. Smith, arrived in Weixian early in 1883 since the evangelists believed medical work would serve as a bridge between the missionaries and the local population. Religion, in this case, took precedence over medicine. From the beginning, Dr. Smith received little support and was forced to practice out of a house outside of town.Letter from H. Smith, Source 29 in StanleyStanley pg. 118-119 Later that same year, Dr. Smith left Weixian and would not be replaced until 1884 by a Dr. J.M. Matthewson. Like Dr. Smith, Dr. Matthewson lacked formal support from the evangelist missionaries and lacked the proper facilities to effectively practice medicine.F. Ellinwood to R. Mateer, Source 30 in StanleyStanley pg. 119 He returned home in 1886. Even with the construction of the Mateer Memorial Hospital in 1889, and the formal appointments of Drs. William Faries, Mary Brown, and Madge Dickson, medicine in Weixian was still seen as being second to religion. The doctors were made to spend more of their time spreading their religion in the surrounding area as opposed to actually practicing medicine.Stanley pg. 121  The Redefinition of Medical Work in the Mission – 1890s-1920s  Starting in the 1890s, with the inevitable arrival of new medical missionaries at Weixian, the doctors started to become dissatisfied with the existing medical facilities. In general, they were displeased with the way that medicine and the health of the population were delegated as secondary objectives. This displeasure, and the desire for outstation dispensaries and the construction of additional hospitals, coincided with the germ theory of disease and its associated emphasis on public health measures.Stanley pg. 121 Two prominent proponents of this ideology at the Weixian mission were Dr. Charles Roys and Dr. LeRoy Heimburger.  Dr. Charles Roys  Dr. Roys, a graduate of the Columbia University College of Surgeons and Physicians, was appointed to the Weixian mission in 1903. In 1906, Dr. Roys wrote about how patients slept on the floor. Concerned with this overcrowding in the two existing hospitals, which had a total of thirty-five beds, Dr. Roys aimed to improve the quality of care for his patients. Through fundraising, Dr. Roys was able to expand the hospital to 249 inpatients in 1907. He also opened a dispensary within the city of Weixian that eventually saw over 6,000 patients a year. For more proper surgeries, Dr. Roys raised money for a sterile operating theater and surgical supplies. And yet, Dr. Roys was met with limited success in regards to fundraising for a new hospital that would replace the Arts College in Weixian that was slated to be removed by 1917. Petitions to the Board of Foreign Missions were met with slow response times and inadequate funding. Likewise, an application to the China Medical Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, which was filed due to Roys’ perception of a lack of support from his own church leadership, proved fruitless. In 1914, the nearby Yu River flooded and severely damaged the existing hospital at the mission. Dr. Roys left for the Medical School in Jinan as a result.Stanley pg. 121-126  Dr. LeRoy Heimburger  Dr. Heimburger joined Dr. Roys in 1913, a year before Dr. Roys left for Jinan, at the Weixian mission. It would be Dr. Heimburger that would actually raise the funds necessary for the construction of a hospital. While the application to the China Medical Board of the Rockefeller Foundation failed, its failure was a learning point for the Board of Foreign Missions. The application was rejected in large part due to the Foundation’s view that the current mission at Weixian lacked support from the Board of Foreign Missions. This realization strengthened the cause of doctors like Dr. Heimburger when the Presbyterian Church embarked on a fundraising campaign that would result in over $10,000 dollars being donated from Shadyside Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh in 1917. With some money in place, plans were drawn out for the hospital later that year. And yet, after this initial donation of money, funds were not forthcoming. Dr. Heimburger became increasingly upset with the church as a result. In a letter to church leadership in 1919, Dr. Heimburger complained about the inadequate support given to medical missionaries and the low status that they held in the eyes of the mission community: Soon after this letter, Dr. Heimburger started to receive more funds for the construction of a new hospital with improved facilities. In 1922, Dr. Heimburger received another donation from the Shadyside Presbyterian Church for $35,000 dollars.The Pittsburgh Press 3 Sept. 1947: 9 With the necessary funds in place, construction on what would be known as the Shadyside Presbyterian Hospital began and was completed in 1925 at the Weixian mission.Stanley 127-131  Notes   References  * 5th Annual Report, Western Foreign Missionary Society, May 1837, Green, Presbyterian Missions, 173-174., cited in Chen, C.

It is based on National Novel Writing Month (\\"NaNoWriMo\\") and other variations of this model including National Blog Posting Month (\\"NaBloPoMo\\") and National Poetry Writing Month (\\"NaPoWriMo\\"). It was established by Charlotte Frost and the academic resource PhD2Published, a blog geared towards helping early-career academics learn how to get published. Sites such as Chronicle of Higher Education, The Teaching Tomtom, and Get a Life, PhD, have featured the project. Participants register for AcWriMo by signing up on the Accountability Spreadsheet, and by posting an initial declaration of intention on the PhD2Published blog post announcing the start of the project, on the site's Facebook page, or by using the Twitter hashtag \\"#AcWriMo.\\"  History  The project was originally called Academic Book Writing Month (or AcBoWriMo) and was created by Charlotte Frost when she was a Provost International Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Center for 21st Century Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee (UWM). Frost aimed to develop an event that would push her and her colleagues to work on their respective academic writing projects and create a writing “team” among them and the wider global academic community. The inaugural event took place November 2011 with over one hundred participants sharing their progress on their blogs and social media accounts; such blogs include Goanatree, Sound & Fury, Finds and Features, The Ambulant Scholar, Emily and the Lime, Read React Review, Glorious Generalist, Standardized Teacher, A Dozen Pickled Limes, Dacia Takes Note, and Constance Kassor. Frost also discussed the start of AcBoWriMo on her own blog. The vast majority of participants claimed to have enjoyed the month-long writing support group who communicated primarily on Twitter. A few dissonant voices argued that writing quality might be compromised by working intensively or that the project could give the impression that academic writing can and should be a fast process. As noted on UWM's website: \\"Criticism has come mainly related to the name. 'A couple of people took it a little too literally and thought I was suggesting you could write an entire, quality academic book in one month, which of course I’m not,' notes Charlotte. Such criticism has been constructive, though, as Charlotte considers ways to improve next year’s event and continue the movement. One possibility is the inclusion of a broader discussion on the nature of academic work. Different subject areas have different demands, and some tasks can be completed quickly while others require a slower and more considered process. While Charlotte has been quick to embrace social media as a communication and team-building tool for the challenge, she also acknowledges that the juxtaposition of instant communication with a discipline that may not move at that speed is a challenge and worthy of a dialogue.\\" Frost responded to critics while the project spoke for itself: many participants continued with the project through December 2011 and adapted a new Twitter hashtag (#AcWri) to refer to the project's more general focus on academic writing. Additionally, other participants defended Frost and the project. In 2012 Frost decided to widen the remit and removed the ‘bo’ (referring to book) dedicating the event to all forms of academic writing  Participation  Each year AcWriMo is organised by Frost through her resource PhD2Published. The PhD2Published website publishes a variety of blog posts on academic writing. Other components include a public accountability spreadsheet and the hashtag #AcWriMo. There is even an application designed with AcWriMo participants in mind called the PhDometer. Although there are far fewer resources than the unconnected NaNoWriMo event. Every year participants abide by the set of 6 rules: # You have to decide on a goal where you count either words, hours or projects. # You declare your goal by signing up on the ‘Accountability Spreadsheet’ # You then draft your approach to the month, making sure you have done enough preparation to write a lot. # You discuss your progress on social media like Twitter and Facebook. # You have to work really hard and not get distracted. # And at the end you must publicly declare your results on the spreadsheet or on social media. AcWriMo has been featured in the Guardian, the Chronicle, and over a hundred other online articles and blog posts. In 2013 Frost partnered with Dr Jesse Stommel to conduct a live workshop in Google Docs on writing collaboratively using Google Docs, from their respective locations Hong Kong and the United States. In December 2013 Digital Humanities Now made this project their ‘editor’s choice’.  AcWri hashtag and community  At the end of the 2011 event founding members of the Academic Writing Month community decided to use the shortened ‘#AcWri’ (Academic Writing) hashtag for communication about academic writing all year round. Following this, live ‘#AcWri’ discussions were organised by then editor of PhD2Published Dr Anna Tarrant and Dr Jeremy Seagrott.

Life  Emilie Desjeux was born in France, in the city of Joigny on 9 October 1861. When Emilie was little, she moved with her family to Paris, where she started to draw in earnest. Then Emilie Desjeux was admitted to the Académie Julian, where she became a student of William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who greatly appreciated her artistic abilities and named Emilie his best student. After graduation from Académie Julian, Desjeux was able to feature her paintings at the \\"Society of the French artists\\"'s exhibitions and salons. In 1900 she had participated in the \\"Exposition Universelle (1900)\\" of Paris. She was decorated with the rank of Officier d'Academie. At the turn of the century Emilie Desjeux took part in the organization \\"Society of women- artists\\" and opened in Paris a painting school annex studio for girls in the Rue du Bac, and later moved to Rue Visconti.L'art: revue mensuelle illustrée... - Volume 61 - Page 38 1902 ... l'aquarelle comme nous venons de le voir; le pastel par MM\\"'\\" Henry Adam, Fanny Fleury, Vignal-Vingal, Frédérique Vallot-Bisson, Mesdemoiselles Carpentier, Émilie Desjeux; la miniature par Mm\\" Debillemont-Chardon et Camille lsbert, .. Emilie Desjeux traveled across Europe, visiting England, Italy, the Netherlands — and recorded her visits in various albums with sketches and her traveling records. Desjeux was an adherent of realist (or academic) painting. Other directions in the arts failed to influence her. In 1906 Emilie Desjeux received a commission from the city council of Auxerre: to depict an historical event, the oration of Émile Combes on the division between church and state. For that time, it was unprecedented that this task was assigned to a woman. In 1908 the picture \\"Speech of Émile Combes\\" (125 x 256 cm), was unveiled in the city museum of Auxerre. It now decorates the city of Auxerre's administration boardroom. At present works of Emilie Desjeux are stored at the city of Auxerre's museum depot, are exhibited at the Musée-Abbaye Saint-Germain and can be found in private collections. Emilie Desjeux died on 23 April 1957. She rests at the cemetery of Bussy-en-Othe, Burgundy.

History The first newspaper in Szilágy County was published in 1877 by Sámuel Borbély, professor at the Teachers' College in Zilah, which also had the title Szilágy. The paper did not last long, its last issue being published on 27 December 1879. In November 1882, Sámuel Arday Balogh launched his own paper, Szilágy és környéke, but similarly to Borbély's paper it did not manage to break through and eventually stopped to publish on 23 April 1883, after only 23 issues. The county, however, did not stay without a paper for too long, as three weeks later, on 6 May 1883, the first edition of Szilágy was published. The newly formed gazette had no connection with Borbély's paper published earlier, and did not even carry on its volume numbers. The first editor-in-chief was Lajos Dénes, who, after being named a crown counsel, gave the position to Gyula Kincs, teacher of the Reformed College in Zilah. One of the students at the college was Endre Ady, whose first poem was published in the Szilágy on 22 March 1896, and who would later also contribute to the paper.

Positive pressure personnel suits (PPPS) — or positive pressure protective suits, informally known as \\"space suits\\", \\"moon suits\\", \\"blue suits\\", etc. — are highly specialized, totally encapsulating, industrial protection garments worn only within special biocontainment or maximum containment (BSL-4) laboratory facilities. These facilities research dangerous pathogens which are highly infectious and may have no treatments or vaccines available. These facilities also feature other special equipment and procedures such as airlock entry, quick-drench disinfectant showers, special waste disposal systems, and shower exits. The PPPS is a sophisticated variety of personal protective equipment (PPE), a type of hazmat suit, which is air-tight and designed for positive pressure to prevent contamination to the wearer even if the suit becomes damaged. BSL-4 cabinets and \\"Suit Laboratories\\" have special engineering and design features to prevent hazardous microorganisms from being disseminated into the outside environment. These biosafety suites, where PPPSs are used, are suites of laboratory rooms which are essentially equivalent to large Class III biosafety cabinets in which the interiors of the PPPSs serve as the \\"outside\\" environment for workers. Examples include the biocontainment suites at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Maryland and the Maximum Containment Facility (MCF) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. Operation Regular inspection of PPPS to locate any punctures or leaks Fresh, filtered air is typically supplied to the interior of a PPPS via overhead tubing. In addition to the physical barrier provided, the positive pressurization offers additional protection in the event of exposure through a defect or puncture in the suit, for if the suit’s integrity is compromised, air will be forced out instead of being sucked in. Extensive training with the PPPS is required to safely pursue research in a PPPS within a biosafety facility. In 1987, USAMRIID scientist Joel Dalrymple described the subjective experience of working in a PPPS and \\"his solemn respect for working in the hot suits\\" to a journalist: > \\"I don't want anyone to prep my suit,\\" he says. \\"It is like packing your own > parachute.\\" Indeed, it is no picnic to do experiments weighted down with all > that gear and paraphernalia. The air hisses so loudly you have to crimp the > air supply to talk to your lab partner. The plastic eyeshield reflects the > lightbulbs in the ceiling. Heat builds up. Fatigue sets in. You can't > scratch or go to the bathroom. And all the time, there is the danger that > you will slip and puncture your suit and infect yourself. After working in > the hot suite, everyone showers and checks the suit, just to make sure that > no tiny punctures turn up. \\"It's just instinct,\\" says Dalrymple. \\"You come > out, pull off your glove, blow it up and hold it. You've been working with > needles all day. It is refreshing to see a glove that remains > inflated.\\"McDermott, Jeanne (1987), The Killing Winds: The Menace of > Biological Warfare; New York; Arbor House, pp 220-221. History In the late 1970s, ILC Dover, LP, developed a special garment, the Demilitarization Protective Ensemble (DPE), to fulfill the U.S. Army’s need for an off-the-shelf, positive pressure, totally encapsulating suit for use by maintenance personnel at a chemical weapons site. The DPE was delivered to the Army in 1979 and is still currently in daily use, with over 700 recorded entries into a \\"hot\\" environment and a perfect safety record. From the technology used in production of the DPE, ILC developed a PPPS to be used for commercial applications. Delta Protection, a subsidiary of French company Bacou-Dalloz, designed a Michelin Man-inspired suit in 2003, known in the United States at that time as French BSL 4 Suit. In July 2007, the CDC purchased 30 Delta Protection suits to be used in BSL-4, and called them \\"orange suits\\". On August 20, 2007, Bacou-Dalloz became Sperian Protection. The same suit design became part of Sperian Protection ventilated suits (\\"White Suits\\"). On September 15, 2010, Sperian Protection became part of Honeywell. The product is now called Honeywell BSL 4 suits. The Chemturion series is a series of multi-use, totally encapsulating PPPSs, currently used by Public Health Canada, Boston University, AI Signal Research, USAMRIID, the CDC, and many industrial companies such as DuPont, Dow, and Georgia Pacific.U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, Suiting up for Safety, Fact Sheet .

In fiction and film PPPSs — along with many less elaborate types of hazmat suit — have long been a staple of the science fiction and thriller genres, where they are used to accentuate the drama of biohazard scenarios. Common dramatic (and generally unrealistic) situations involve a suit failure leading to rapid death in films such as Outbreak (1995). The wearing of a PPPS can underscore the villainy and \\"otherness\\" of movie bad guys as in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). A recent, more sedate, example of PPPSs in a film is the Steven Soderbergh movie Contagion (2011). In the Mass Effect series of video games, several types of aliens use variants of PPPSs, most notably the character Tali, who suffers from a compromised immune system. In Moebius's comic Edena, the residents of the Nest City wear similar suits at all times to protect themselves from diseases, as do the denizens of Javecek in Carla Speed McNeill's comic Finder. In Bethesda's Fallout games, the Hazmat Suit is an armor item which can be equipped on a character to prevent radiation damage.

It stars Sheila Ryan, Noreen Nash, James Brown and Regis Toomey. The story concerns the efforts of a crooked gambling ring to fix college basketball games. This film was the final production of Producers Releasing Corporation.  Plot  After retiring from the service, Ken Williams goes back to his old school, Norton University, where he used to be an appreciated student with an expected future as a basketball player. Together with fellow veteran Andy Rawlins, Ken registers to continue and complete his studies. They are welcomed back by the student liaison for veterans, Ann Taylor, and Andy is a bit surprised by the warm welcome, since he is in the dark about Ken's previous accolades. Ken also refuses to join the basketball team, which confuses Andy even more. Soon Ken is romantically involved with Ann, but he can't be persuaded even by her to reveal his reasons for not participating in the university basketball. He claims he has to focus on his engineering studies, and this disappoints coach Ambrose, who is eager to have him back on the team. One night a woman turns up at the house where Ken resides, and demand to see him. Ken interrupts his date with Ann to talk to the woman, who turn out to be his kid sister Lillian. She is involved with gangster Del Cassini, who is responsible for making Ken fix basketball games before the war. That is the reason why he quite the basketball team in the first place and also interrupted his education. Lillian convinces Ken that she is no longer involved with Del Cassini, and that Ken can safely return to the team. It turns out she is lying, and after her meeting with Ken she goes dorwctly to Del Cassini to inform him that their plan worked out fine. Unaware of this, Ken rejoins the basketball team and is very happy with his decision. Soon one of Del cassini's goons approach him and tells him to lose their opening game of the season. Ken is furious and hits the man, but is threatened that Lillian will go to jail if he doesn't comply. Apparently she was involved in a hit-and-run car accident a while ago, and got saved by Del Cassini from the law. Ken still refuses to cooperate. Ken doesn't know that the real leader of Del Cassini's operation is police lieutenant Brenner. When Brenner hears that Ken refuses to cooperate, heinstead tricks Ken into participating in an undercover operation to uncover the organized crime in the area, focusing on illegal gambling in college sports. Brenner asks Ken to pretend to cooperate with Del Cassini to get inside the gangster ring and find evidence. Ken agrees to this and becomes Del Cassini's marionette. He tells Ann about the operation, and seeing how unhappy Ken is with the current situation, she decides to help him out as best she can. Ann finds out that there was no accident where Lillian was involved. She meets with Lillian in a club, and Lillian confesses everything was made up to get Ken to fix the games. Ann in turn tells Ken what she has found out, and Ken quits his undercover duty with immediate effect. Brenner has put a lot of money on Norton losing their next game and is quite worried with Ken's decision. He also punishes Lillian for squealing, and shoots her. Then he goes on to capture Ken. Lillian dies from her wounds, but before she does she manages to reveal to Andy that Brenner is the real crook and runs the crime syndicate. Andy gathers the basketball team and brings them to Ken's rescue. Ken is held hostage at a hotel. When Del Cassini arrives at the hotel and finds out Brenner has killed Lillian, he is furious and shoots Brenner as revenge. The basketball team then runs into the hotel and rescues Ken. The others explain to Ken that it was Lillian who saved him in the end. Ken plays with the Norton team and they win the championship tournament. After the win, he and Ann are married.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/68657/The-Big-Fix/#  Cast  * James Brown as Ken Williams * Sheila Ryan as Lillian * Noreen Nash as Ann Taylor * Regis Toomey as Lieutenant Brenner * Tommy Noonan as Andy Rawlins * John Shelton as Del Cassini * Charles McGraw as Armiston * Grantland Rice as himself References External links * 1947 films 1947 crime films American films Film noir Producers Releasing Corporation films American crime films Films directed by James Flood American black-and-white films ","title":"The Big Fix (1947 film)"},{"id":"34080684","text":"The 1994–95 Tercera División season is the 18th season since establishment the tier four.

Neotropical Ichthyology, 14 (4): e150146. They are found in a wide range of static or slow-flowing freshwater habitats such as edges of rivers, streams, floodplains and swamps, but they are absent from deep river channels (a habitat of many other knifefish). There are both species in well-oxygenated waters and poorly oxygenated waters; those in the latter have adaptions that allow them to survive this like larger gills or the capability of gulping up mouthfuls of air from the water surface. Brachyhypopomus feed during the night on small invertebrates. They are small to medium sized knifefish, reaching up to in total length depending on the species involved. Overall the various species are similar in general shape, but they do differ in morphometrics and meristics. They vary in general color and pattern, but are well-camouflaged and typically brownish. During the night they change color and become very pale, even species that are dark-colored during the day. Brachyhypopomus are very similar to Microsternarchus and Procerusternarchus.

Geography The Aulnois rises in the forest of Muno which stretches over the south of the Belgian province of Luxembourg. It generally flows southwards throughout its course. After crossing the Franco-Belgian border it continues towards the south until its confluence with the Chiers, which occurs at Carignan in the Ardennes just after the Aulnois has received its main tributary, the Matton.

A fire broke out during the night, causing a flashover on the ground floor, and swiftly expanded over all four storeys of the hotel. The escape routes in the hotel were poorly lit, and because of the smoke development in the hotel, escape was nearly impossible. Of the 86 people in the hotel, 9 were killed, two as a result of attempting to escape. An additional 16 guests were severely injured. The previous day, the Chemie Halle began their stay in the hotel. They had played a tied match on 15 September against PSV Eindhoven in the first round of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup in Halle. One of the Chemie Halle players, 21-year-old midfielder Wolfgang Hoffmann, died in the fire, while several others were injured.Craig McCracken: How Chemie Halle's European dream ended in tragedy 45 years ago today, The Guardian (28 September 2016). Retrieved 5 November 2016. The return match, to be played in Den Bosch, never took place. The cause of the fire was never found. At approximately 5:30 CET a bus driver discovered a fire in the restaurant of the hotel. The driver alerted the porter, but because there had already been so much smoke development, they did not dare enter the hotel. The fire department arrived a few minutes later to see several guests who lay in the streets after jumping from the hotel windows, and many others visibly trapped on the upper floors. The fire fighters initially focused on saving as many hotel guests as possible before extinguishing the fire. Only at 7:45 in the morning the fire was declared under control; rendering the fire safe took up an entire day. The fire in Hotel 't Silveren Seepaerd resulted in strict fire safety regulations for hotels and restaurants. The hotel was never rebuilt.

Naming  Knocknadobar means \\"hill of the wells\\". The mountain is in south-west corner of Ireland standing against the prevailing south-west winds carrying rain from the North Atlantic; thus Knocknadobar absorbs significant water, and in places, freshwater literally springs out of the ground like a Well. There are holy wells at the base of the Mountain, most notably St. Fursey's Holy Well, which has been a site of pilgrimage since medieval times, dedicated to Saint Fursey (c 597–650 AD). Paul Tempan notes that St. Fursey's Holy Well was noted as a cure for eye complaints.  Geography  Summit cross Kcocknadobar is northeast of Cahersiveen, and north of the N70 road, on the coast of Dingle Bay. Knocknadobar is an almost \\"stand- alone\\" mountain, and thus its in height, translates into of prominence, qualifying it to meet the British Isles Marilyn classification. Knocknadobar also meets the Arderin, Simm and Hewitt classifications. Knocknadobar ranks as the 32nd-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the prominence threshold is over 100 metres.  Pilgrimage  Station of the cross Cnoc na dTobar is noted as an ancient pilgrim mountain. Even before Christian times, in the 5th-century, the Knocknadobar was a place of celebrations for Celtic Lúghnasa Festivals in August. Lúgh (pronounced Loo) was the god of the Harvest, and festivals or dancing and merriment were held on high ground to make offerings for a good harvest, and Knocknatobar's wide flat summit provided a suitable venue. The word for August in the Irish language is \\"Lúhgnasa\\" (pronounced in English as \\"Luanasa). In 1884–85, Christian crosses were placed along on the ancient pilgrim trail to represent the 14 stations of the cross, and an altar and a large Celtic cross was placed at the top where mass is said yearly; these works were undertaken by Canon Brosnan of Cahersiveen. The full Cnock na dTobar Pilgrimage Path takes circa 3.5 hours to complete the 9-kilometre route, and is part of the National Pilgrim Passport scheme run by Pilgrim Paths of Ireland. The flat summit offers views of other major pilgrimage sites: Mount Brandon, and Skellig Michael.

She also works for the Makai company, and makes appearances for the Oz Academy and Pro Wrestling Wave promotions. She started her professional wrestling career in 2008, when she joined the Ice Ribbon promotion, after taking part in a film titled Three Count, set in the world of professional wrestling. She remained with the promotion until 2014, becoming a one-time ICE×60 Champion and four-time International Ribbon Tag Team Champion. Outside of Ice Ribbon, Shida has held the Wave Single Championship, the Oz Academy Tag Team Championship and the Sendai Girls World Tag Team Championship. Early life In her childhood, Shida practised both judo and kendo, reaching third-dan in the latter. She later embarked on a career as an actress, most notably working on the television series Muscle Venus, forming an idol group with fellow cast members Hina Kozuki, Ichiko Mayu, Miyako Matsumoto, Sachiko Koga, Tomoyo Morihisa, Tsukasa Fujimoto, Yuki Ueda and Yuri Natsume. In 2009, Shida was cast in the leading role in a film titled Three Count, set in the world of professional wrestling and also starring veteran professional wrestlers Emi Sakura, Kyoko Inoue and Yoshiko Tamura. For the role, Shida began training under Sakura at her Ice Ribbon dojo and after the conclusion of the taping, decided to find a new career in professional wrestling, joining Ice Ribbon with fellow cast members of both Muscle Venus and Three Count, Ichiko Mayu, Miyako Matsumoto, Sachiko Koga, Tomoyo Morihisa, Tsukasa Fujimoto and Yuki Ueda, though only Shida, Matsumoto and Fujimoto lasted more than six months, making new careers out of professional wrestling. Professional wrestling career Ice Ribbon (2008–2014) Shida made her debut for Ice Ribbon on July 20, 2008, losing to Kazumi Shimouma. As is customary for a rookie in Japanese professional wrestling, Shida's first months in the business included mainly losses with only one singles victory, over Miyako Matsumoto on November 15. In March 2009, Shida finally started picking up victories more regularly, starting a partnership, and later a feud, with Makoto. On September 13, 2009, Shida ventured into the world of mixed martial arts, when she took part in a grappling match at the Jewels promotion's 5th Ring event. Shida lost the match, after submitting to Ayaka Hamasaki's armlock in 38 seconds. Shida in July 2010 During the summer of 2010, Shida made several appearances for the NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling promotion. Though pegged early on as the \\"Future Ace of Joshi Puroresu\\", Shida was the last of the Three Count threesome to reach a championship in Ice Ribbon. On October 20, 2010, Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto received their first shot at the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship, but were defeated by Emi Sakura and Nanae Takahashi. In a rematch between the two teams on December 23, Shida and Fujimoto were victorious and became the new International Ribbon Tag Team Champions. The following day the team, known collectively as Muscle Venus, made their debut for the Smash promotion at Happening Eve, where they teamed with Sayaka Obihiro in a six-woman tag team match, where they were defeated by Cherry, Tomoka Nakagawa and Toshie Uematsu. Back in Ice Ribbon, Shida wrestled the biggest match of her career, up to that point, when she unsuccessfully challenged Yoshiko Tamura for the NEO Single and NWA Women's Pacific Championships on December 26 at Ribbon Mania 2010. Shida and Fujimoto then went on to successfully defend the International Tag Team Championship against Hikari Minami and Riho on January 4, 2011, and against the teams of Mochi Miyagi and Ryo Mizunami, and Makoto and Riho on February 6, winning the \\"Ike! Ike! Ima, Ike! Ribbon Tag Tournament\\" in the process. After defending the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship against Bambi and Makoto at a Kaientai Dojo event on March 20, Shida and Fujimoto lost the title to Emi Sakura and Ray six days later. On March 21, Shida was voted by Ice Ribbon fans as the opponent for visiting Smash wrestler Syuri. Shida would win the match with the Falcon Arrow. The match eventually led to a partnership between the two Kanagawa wrestlers, and, after defeating Chii Tomiya and Makoto on April 16, Shida and Syuri went on to unsuccessfully challenge Emi Sakura and Ray for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship on May 5. The partnership also carried over to Smash, where Shida and Syuri defeated Io and Mio Shirai in a tag team match on May 3 at Smash.17. On June 9 at Smash.18, Shida was defeated by Syuri in a first round match of a tournament to determine the inaugural Smash Diva Champion. On September 24, Shida and Fujimoto attempted to regain the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship, but were defeated in the semifinals of a tournament for the vacant title by Manami Toyota and Tsukushi. The following month, Shida and Fujimoto, along with Emi Sakura and Hikari Minami, traveled to Nottingham, England to take part in events promoted by Pro Wrestling EVE and Southside Wrestling Entertainment (SWE). During 2011, Shida also took part in Ice Ribbon's interpromotional rivalry with the Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling promotion. On October 27, Shida, Emi Sakura, Hikari Minami, Tsukasa Fujimoto and Tsukushi represented Ice Ribbon in Sendai's Joshi Puroresu Dantai Taikou Flash tournament, a single-elimination tournament, where different joshi promotions battled each other. The team was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by Team Sendai (Meiko Satomura, Dash Chisako, Kagetsu, Miyako Morino and Sendai Sachiko). Shida posing after defeating Tsukushi in January 2012 When Tsukasa Fujimoto regained the ICE×60 Championship on November 19, it was announced that Shida would be her first challenger on December 25 at RibbonMania 2011. On December 7, Shida pinned Fujimoto in a tag team match, where she teamed with Maki Narumiya and Fujimoto with Mochi Miyagi. At RibbonMania 2011, Shida defeated Fujimoto to win the ICE×60 Championship for the first time.

The following day, Fujimoto and Tsukushi defeated the Happy Makers at Ice Ribbon's sixth anniversary event to regain the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship, making Fujimoto a quadruple champion. On June 23, Fujimoto lost the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship to her tag team partner Tsukushi, who pinned her after a match, but shortly afterwards comically regained the title from one of Ice Ribbon's ring mats. The following day, Fujimoto returned to DDT to defend the title in a ten- person, ten-minute battle royal. After losing the title to Hiroshi Fukuda, Fujimoto later regained the title from Tanomusaku Toba and ended the match as the reigning champion. However, immediately afterwards, Fujimoto was rolled up by Choun Shiryu, who then left the arena as the new champion. When the round- robin portion of the 2012 Catch the Wave ended, Fujimoto finished with two wins, one draw and one loss, tied at the top of the Black Dahlia block. On July 1, she was eliminated from the tournament, after losing a tiebreaker match against Yumi Ohka. Afterwards, Fujimoto continued working regularly for Wave, however, no longer representing Black Dahlia. The following week, as the reigning Reina World Tag Team Champions, Fujimoto and Shida traveled to Mexico to work for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). Working just under their given names, Tsukasa and Hikaru made their CMLL debuts on July 3 in Guadalajara, teaming with La Comandante in a six-woman tag team match, where they were defeated by Goya Kong, Luna Mágica and Silueta. Three days later, Tsukasa and Hikaru teamed with Lady Apache in Mexico City in another six-woman tag team match, where they were defeated by Dark Angel, Estrellita and Marcela. Tsukasa's and Hikaru's tour of CMLL concluded on June 8 in Mexico City, when they teamed with Princesa Sujei to defeat Dalys la Caribeña, Lluvia and Luna Mágica in a six-woman tag team match.

After wins over Apple Miyuki and Kyusei Ninja Ranmaru and Wave Tag Team Champions Gami and Tomoka Nakagawa, Fujimoto and Ohata finished their round-robin block with five points, winning their block and advancing to the finals of the tournament. Following Emi Sakura's departure from Ice Ribbon at the beginning of 2012, Fujimoto and Hikaru Shida took over the promotion's training duties, and on October 19, introduced their first five trainees; Eri Wakamatsu, Fumiko Sato, Risa Okuda, Rutsuko Yamaguchi and Shoko Hotta, all set to make their debuts during the rest of the year. On October 28 at 2012 Yokohama Ribbon III, Fujimoto received the first shot at new ICE×60 Champion Mio Shirai, but ultimately failed in her challenge for the title. On November 16, Fujimoto and Ohata defeated Shuu Shibutani and Syuri to win the 2012 Dual Shock Wave and earn a shot at the Wave Tag Team Championship. On November 25 at Nagoya Ribbon II – 2012, Fujimoto and Hikaru Shida entered a one-day tag team tournament, where they were forced to put the Reina World Tag Team Championship on the line in all of their matches. They were, however, given a bye directly to the semifinals of the tournament. After defeating Neko Nitta and Shuu Shibutani in their semifinal match, Fujimoto and Shida defeated Kurumi and Tsukushi to not only win the tournament and retain the Reina World Tag Team Championship, but to also win the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. Two days later, Fujimoto and Misaki Ohata defeated Gami and Tomoka Nakagawa to win the Wave Tag Team Championship, making Fujimoto a triple tag team champion. However, Fujimoto's reign as a triple tag team champion was short-lived as on November 28, she and Hikaru Shida lost both the International Ribbon and Reina World Tag Team Championships to Hailey Hatred and Hamuko Hoshi. At Ice Ribbon's year-end RibbonMania 2012 event on December 31, Fujimoto and Hikaru Shida were defeated in a tag team match by World Wonder Ring Stardom representatives Nanae Takahashi and Natsuki☆Taiyo. On January 14, Fujimoto made her debut for World Wonder Ring Stardom, when she replaced a sick Eri Susa as a representative of Nanae Gundan in the Artist of Stardom Championship tournament, from which she, Miho Wakizawa and Yui Yokoo were eliminated in the first round by Kawasaki Katsushika Saikyou Densetsu Plus One (Act Yasukawa, Natsuki☆Taiyo and Saki Kashima). On January 19, Fujimoto entered a tournament to determine the new Triangle Ribbon Champion, defeating Kurumi and Tsukushi in her first round match. On January 26, Fujimoto entered another tournament, contested for the also vacant ICE×60 Championship, defeating Kurumi in her opening round-robin match. After a win over Miyako Matsumoto on February 2, Fujimoto finished her round-robin block with a loss against Hamuko Hoshi on February 9. Despite the loss, Fujimoto became the second wrestler to ensure a spot in the semifinals of the tournament. On February 11, Fujimoto was defeated in the finals of the Triangle Ribbon Championship tournament by Miyako Matsumoto in a three-way match, which also included Mio Shirai. On February 23, Fujimoto was eliminated from the ICE×60 Championship tournament in the semifinals by Tsukushi.

On March 31, Fujimoto and Shida defeated Pro Wrestling Wave's Gami and Ryo Mizunami to advance to a match to determine the number one contenders to the International Ribbon Tag Team and Reina World Tag Team Championships. On April 21, Fujimoto and Ohata lost the Wave Tag Team Championship to Kana and Mio Shirai in their fourth title defense. On April 29, Fujimoto returned to World Wonder Ring Stardom to take part in the promotion's big Ryōgoku Cinderella event at Ryōgoku Kokugikan, teaming with Mika Nagano and Nanae Takahashi in a six-woman tag team match, where they defeated Hiroyo Matsumoto, Kaori Yoneyama and Syuri.

On May 25, Fujimoto and Shida defeated Aoi Kizuki and Tsukushi to win the International Ribbon Tag Team and Reina World Tag Team Championships, starting Fujimoto's record-tying fifth reign as one half of the International Ribbon Tag Team Champions. Two days later, Fujimoto and Shida relinquished the Reina World Tag Team Championship and returned the title to the Reina Joshi Puroresu promotion, which had recently undergone a change in management. On June 22, 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling held its first event in six months, during which Fujimoto defeated Hamuko Hoshi to win the IW19 Championship for the second time. On July 14, the title was retired, when Fujimoto defeated Tsukushi in a championship unification match to win the ICE×60 Championship for the fourth time. Post-match, Fujimoto officially abolished the title's weight limit, before nominating Manami Toyota as her first challenger. To reflect the removal of the weight limit, Fujimoto's title was renamed the ICE×∞ Championship on August 12. On August 25, Fujimoto defeated Toyota at Muscle Venus' fifth anniversary event for her first successful title defense. From September 1 to October 6, Fujimoto and Shida took part in Pro Wrestling Wave's 2013 Dual Shock Wave tournament, where they made it all the way to the finals, before losing to Ayako Hamada and Yuu Yamagata in a three-way match, which also included Kana and Yumi Ohka. In late 2013, Fujimoto reunited with Misaki Ohata and her new partner Mio Shirai to form a new three-woman stable named Kuros. The stable mainly worked in Pro Wrestling Wave, where they made it to the finals of the 6-Person Tag Tournament in November, but the alliance also carried over to Ice Ribbon. On November 17, Fujimoto made her debut for Wrestle-1, defeating her trainee Risa Sera in a singles match. Despite Hikaru Shida announcing her forthcoming departure from Ice Ribbon, she and Fujimoto continued their reign as the International Ribbon Tag Team Champions, eventually reaching their ninth successful title defense by defeating N3 (Maki Narumiya and Meari Naito) on March 22 in what was billed as Muscle Venus' final match together. On March 30, Fujimoto defeated longtime tag team partner Hikaru Shida in her final Ice Ribbon match. Post-match, the two relinquished the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship, ending their reign during which they set new records for both the longest reign, at 309 days, and most successful title defenses, with nine. On April 14, the 274th day of her ICE×∞ Championship reign, Fujimoto became the longest reigning champion in the title's history by breaking Shida's previous record. From May 5 to July 4, Fujimoto took part in the round-robin portion of the 2014 Catch the Wave tournament. After starting off with two losses and a draw, Fujimoto bounced back with a win over Wave Single Champion Yumi Ohka and after subsequent wins over Kyoko Kimura and Kyusei Sakura Hirota, finished tied second in her block, advancing to a playoff match. On July 13, Fujimoto claimed the number two spot in her block and advanced to the knockout stage of the tournament, after pinning Tomoka Nakagawa in a three-way double elimination match, also involving Kyoko Kimura. On July 27, Fujimoto was eliminated from the tournament by Misaki Ohata. On September 23, Fujimoto entered the 2014 Dual Shock Wave, teaming with Yumi Ohka, playing off the two's management roles in their respective home promotions.

The following month, Fujimoto returned to the United States to work Shimmer Women Athletes' October 18 and 19 tapings. On the first day, she teamed with Akino and Kaori Yoneyama to defeat Kellie Skater, Mia Yim and Tomoka Nakagawa on Volume 67, before teaming with Yoneyama on Volume 68 to unsuccessfully challenge Skater and Nakagawa for the Shimmer Tag Team Championship. The following day, Fujimoto and Yoneyama defeated Nevaeh and Sassy Stephie on Volume 69, before Fujimoto ended her weekend by losing to Mia Yim on Volume 70. Back in Ice Ribbon, Fujimoto made her ninth successful defense of the ICE×∞ Championship on November 24 against Aoi Kizuki. Following the match, Fujimoto nominated JWP Joshi Puroresu's Openweight Champion Arisa Nakajima as her next challenger. Nakajima had earlier nominated Fujimoto as her next challenger, leading to Ice Ribbon and JWP announcing a double title match for December 28 at Korakuen Hall. First at Ribbon Mania 2014, Ice Ribbon's biggest annual event, Fujimoto would defend the ICE×∞ Championship against Nakajima and six hours later at JWP–Climax 2014, JWP's biggest event of the year, Nakajima would defend the JWP Openweight Championship against Fujimoto. On November 26, Kuros won Pro Wrestling Wave's second annual One Day 6-Person Tag Tournament, defeating Cherry, Meari Naito and Shuu Shibutani in the finals and, as a result, earned the right to produce the December 14 Wave event. In the first title match on December 28 at Ribbon Mania 2014, Fujimoto made her tenth successful defense of the ICE×∞ Championship against Nakajima, tying Emi Sakura's record for most successful defenses in the title's history. Later that same day at JWP–Climax 2014, Fujimoto failed in her attempt to capture the JWP Openweight Championship from Nakajima. On January 4, 2015, Fujimoto made her eleventh successful defense of the ICE×∞ Championship against Risa Sera, setting a new record for most successful defenses in the title's history.

On July 29, Fujimoto celebrated her 32nd birthday with a gauntlet match, featuring 32 participants from both Ice Ribbon and outside of the promotion. She finished the match with eight wins, four losses and twenty time-limit draws. Afterwards, Manami Toyota, the final entrant in the match, endorsed Fujimoto as her successor, giving her the right to her Japanese Ocean finishing maneuvers and officially dubbing her the second generation \\"Flying Angel\\". On August 20, Kuros produced their final independent event, before the stable's dissolution, where Fujimoto, Ohata and Shirai defeated Chikayo Nagashima, Kayoko Haruyama and Meiko Satomura in a six-woman tag team main event. With Kuros done, Fujimoto found herself a new stable in Fairy Nipponbashi's Wonderful World Fairy Family (WWFF). On October 17, Best Friends defeated another Ice Ribbon/JWP team of Aoi Kizuki and Kayoko Haruyama to win the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. Between October 26 and November 3, Fujimoto took part in a tournament to crown the new Reina World Women's Champion. After defeating Rina Yamashita in the quarterfinals and Yako Fujigasaki in the semifinals, Fujimoto defeated Syuri in the finals to win the tournament and become the new Reina World Women's Champion. She made her first successful defense of the title at an Ice Ribbon show on November 23 against Yuka. She made her second successful defense back in Reina on December 26 against Maki Narumiya.

On March 25, 2016, Fujimoto lost the Reina World Women's Championship to Makoto in her second defense. On May 4 at Ice Ribbon's 10th anniversary event, Fujimoto wrestled in a special non-title tag team match, which featured the promotion's founder Emi Sakura wrestling her first Ice Ribbon match in over four years. In the match, Fujimoto and Arisa Nakajima defeated Sakura and Nanae Takahashi with Fujimoto pinning Sakura for the win. In June, Fujimoto made it to the finals of the 32-wrestler 2016 Catch the Wave tournament, but was defeated there by Ryo Mizunami. On July 3, Fujimoto defeated Risa Sera to win the ICE×∞ Championship for the fifth time. On August 14, Fujimoto and Nakajima lost the Daily Sports Women's Tag Team and JWP Tag Team Championships to Hanako Nakamori and Kyoko Kimura in their fourth title defense. After four successful title defenses, Best Friends lost the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship to Hiiragi Kurumi and Tsukushi on September 19. After nine successful defenses, Fujimoto was stripped of the ICE×∞ Championship on November 3, after her defense against Tsukushi ended in a 30-minute time limit draw. Fujimoto eventually made it to the finals of a tournament to crown the new champion, before losing to Risa Sera on December 31. On June 25, 2017, Fujimoto defeated Manami Toyota and Tsukushi to win the Triangle Ribbon Championship for the third time.

Background Richard Marshal, the second son of the more famous William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, was a leader of the barons opposed to the growth of King Henry's powers. He was an adversary of the king's foreign allies at court, notably the Poitevins Peter de Rivaux and Peter des Roches. Marshal refused to attend Henry's court at Gloucester in August 1233, and Henry declared him a traitor. Marshal retired to his castle at Striguil (Chepstow), while the king and his army moved west to Abergavenny. In response, Marshal joined with Owain to seize the castles at Cardiff and Newport before attacking Abergavenny and Grosmont. The king then retreated to Gloucester.Arthur Clark, The Story of Monmouthshire, Vol. 1, Christopher Davies hi, 1962, pp.99-100Raymond Howell, A History of Gwent, Gomer Press, 1988, , p.79 Battle William Marshal at a joust unhorses Baldwin. From the Chronica Majora of Matthew Paris. According to the chronicler Roger of Wendover in his Flores Historiarum (Flowers of History), Marshal and his knights then came to Monmouth to reconnoitre the town before besieging it. However, they were seen coming towards the castle walls by Baldwin III, Count of Guînes. He was a nobleman of Flanders who, with his mixed force of Flemings and Poitevins, had been entrusted by King Henry with defending the town. The local lord, John of Monmouth, was absent from the battle. Baldwin wrongly thought that Marshal had only a few followers with him, and rode out with his forces to pursue him, but Marshal turned the tables. It was said of Marshal, in defending himself against Baldwin's men, that: Roger of Wendover, Flowers of History: the history of England from the descent of the Saxons to A.D. 1235. vol.2, pp.575-576.

Duke University Case Cite: 190 F.3d 643, 138 Ed. Law Rep. 113 (4th Cir. 1999) In 1997, Heather Sue Mercer sued Duke University for discrimination after her dismissal from Duke's intercollegiate football program. Mercer had been an all-state placekicker at Yorktown High School in Yorktown Heights, New York. From 1994 through 1995, she participated in Duke's football program as a manager. Mercer challenged the federal district court's earlier decision holding that Title IX provides a blanket exemption for contact sports and the court's consequent dismissal of her claim that Duke University discriminated against her.  Background  In the fall of 1994 Mercer tried out for the Duke Football team as a walk-on placekicker. Mercer was the first female to try out for Duke’s football team. Mercer didn’t make the team, but instead took a manager position on the team. While she was on the team she did many of the conditioning drills routinely performed by football kickers.FindLaw  Cases and Codes Mercer claims that the coach Fred Goldsmith made offensive remarks about her gender. She was cut from the team in 1996, and claimed that the reason she was cut was because of her sex. This is against Duke's rules of athletics, which state: \\"No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.\\"  Court's decision  The trial court found that the regulations of athletics do not apply to contact sports, stating that Duke University prohibited females from trying out for contact sports and that it rested upon the coach’s discretion to allow it. It stated that federally funded institutions have separate teams for men and women in many sports which included the contact sport of football.The Duke coach told Heather Mercer she was on the team. - 09.29.97 - SI VaultCOLLEGE FOOTBALL; A Kicker Sues, Saying She Was Treated Unfairly - New York TimesSPORTS PEOPLE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;Female Place-Kicker Gets a Tryout at Duke - New York TimesCharlotte: Search Results However, the Circuit Court sided with her on appeal.COLLEGES; Female Kicker's Suit Is Good - New York Times  References  External links * http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate- courts/F3/401/199/551542/ Duke Blue Devils football ","title":"Heather Sue Mercer-Duke Football case"},{"id":"34081162","text":"M Street High School, also known as Perry School, is a historic former school building located in the Northwest Quadrant of Washington, D.C. It has been listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites since 1978 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The building escaped demolition with community support and the efforts of preservationists and is now a community center. History The school was founded in 1870 as the Preparatory High School for Negro Youth, also called Washington High School. Between 1870 and 1891 the school was located in several makeshift locations. In 1890, Congress appropriated $112,000 to build a permanent school and the building on M Street was then designed by Thomas Entwistle from the Office of Building Inspector and built from 1890–1891. It was one of the nation's first high schools for African Americans and represents an important development of Washington's education system. The African American community had to fight for quality education in the city. The dual school system created disparities in facilities, grounds, architectural design and size. However, the school provided a rigorous curriculum and an extraordinary faculty because of the limited professional opportunities for African Americans. Principals at the school included Francis L. Cardozo, Sr., Robert H. Terrell and Anna J. Cooper. Among the many teachers was Carter G. Woodson who taught French, Spanish, English, and history, and Christian Fleetwood, a recipient of the Medal of Honor. The school produced a high percentage of college graduates, sending graduates to Harvard, Yale, and Brown, among other places, and its alumni included many prominent educators and public figures. The high school was moved to a new building on a different site in 1916, when it was renamed Dunbar High School after the famous African- American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. \\"The M Street School, 1896-1916,\\" by Ralph Davis and Dr. Beverly Gordon, 2010 In 1919, the 128 M Street school building became the home of the M Street Junior High School, which was renamed Shaw Junior High School in 1921. Then in 1928, Shaw moved to the Mckinley Manual Technical School building at 7th and Rhode Island Avenue, NW. From 1929 to 1932, the M Street High School building was used to house students from Cardozo High School. In 1932 it became M Street Junior High School, later named Terrell Junior High School. In 1952 it was renamed again as the Leon L. Perry Middle School, named for a principal, supervising principal and school board member of the black school system from 1914-1945. In 1954 the school was integrated. Shortly thereafter it was closed. The building continued to find new life. In the 1960s it was used as a homeless shelter and food distribution center. In 1978 it was nominated for landmark status. At the time it was slated to be torn down to create a playground for students from nearby Terrell Junior High School, but following the landmark nomination the school board instead decided to preserve it. In the 1980s the city tried to sell it to developers, but the local community sought to preserve it as a community asset. In 1986 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and in 1989, the D.C. school board approved the use of the vacant Perry School for a community service center. In 1998 the building became home of the Perry School Community Services, Inc, a non-profit health and community service center.

It is a wood frame structure in the Queen Anne architectural style built around 1890. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is unique among Aspen's Queen Anne houses both for its minimal decoration and its corner tower. The name comes from its first two occupants. In the later 20th century it was the home of Edgar Stanton, a cofounder of the Aspen Music Festival and School who established its training program for recording engineers. It has remained a private residence, largely intact from the time of its construction. Building The house is located on the north fringe of Aspen's residential West End, on the west side of North Second between West Smuggler Street and Lake Avenue. It is surrounded by other houses, most of a more modern construction, but another surviving Victorian residence, the Newberry House, also listed on the Register, is located a block to the east. Tall mature trees provide shade throughout the neighborhood, which has generally level terrain, sloping very slightly to the Roaring Fork River to the north. Across the street a small playground faces the house on an otherwise undeveloped triangular lot. A plain wooden picket fence sets off the house from the street. It is a two-story wood frame house on a high sandstone foundation. It is mostly sided with clapboard except in the fields of its cross-gabled roofs, which use wood \\"dog-ear\\" shingles, common in the city. On the southeast corner is a large octagonal tower with a conical roof. Like the main block its roof is shingled. North of the tower a porch runs across the east (front) facade at the first story. It has a shed roof supported by wooden piers with decorative woodwork between them, crossed by a gable sheltering the main entrance. An open porch is located along the rear. All windows are one- over-one double-hung sash windows, except for the second story of the northeast facet of the tower, which has a single-pane window. A small louvered vent is in the uppermost cross-gable field. History Arthur Shilling built the house around 1890. At the time, Aspen was a booming mining town that had barely been much more than a primitive encampment of tents and log cabins a decade earlier. Fortunes were being made from the abundant silver lodes in the neighboring mountains, and many who had earned them put some of them into building lavish houses for themselves. Many of those houses were erected in the undeveloped West End, which had long been platted and drawn up with a grid plan for its streets. Shilling, a dry goods store owner, chose a lot near the north side for his home. It was fairly unrestrained in its application of the contemporary Queen Anne style, with nested and cross-gabling creating a complex interplay of forms, and a signature tower attached to the house. That, and its relatively plain facades, distinguished it from some of other surviving Queen Annes in the city, like the Smith–Elisha House on West Main Street (also listed on the National Register) and the Ola Case House on West Francis Street. Three years later, the Panic of 1893 led Congress to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which had sustained Aspen's growth by requiring the government to buy silver to support the dollar. Mines closed, people left Aspen for opportunities elsewhere. This began a long period of the city's history known as the \\"quiet years\\", marked by a constantly declining population and economic hardship. Five years later, Albert Lamb, who had come from Leadville in 1887 and established a successful drugstore, bought Shilling's house. During the quiet years, many of the buildings from the city's prosperous beginnings fell vacant, often becoming the property of Pitkin County due to tax foreclosures. With no money available to maintain them, they succumbed to either fires or the effects of the severe Rocky Mountain winters at almost above sea level. At some point during this time, the house was modified slightly. Some of the windows were expanded. Finials were removed from the tower and roof. The rear porch, original covered by a gabled roof supported by turned wooden columns, was extended and its roof removed. The quiet years came to an end just before the middle of the 20th century, after World War II. Skiing enthusiasts had begun developing trails on the nearby mountains in the late 1930s, and returned to continue their work a decade later. The new Aspen Skiing Company received a boost from investments by Walter Paepcke, a Chicago executive who, along with his wife Elizabeth, saw in Aspen the perfect place to establish a classical music festival in the U.S. to rival Salzburg. The Paepckes bought most of the old houses and commercial properties in Aspen with the intent of restoring them. Among their purchases was the Shilling—Lamb house. They in turn sold it to Francis and Edgar Stanton and their wives in 1950. The Stantons had been taken with Aspen four years earlier and were spending more time there, eventually becoming full-time residents. Along with the Paepckes, Edgar Stanton was a founding board member of the Aspen Music Festival and School. He had worked in audio engineering during the war, and established the Edgar Stanton Audio Recording Institute in the early 1950s to complement the music festival and train engineers. He soon developed new property of his own on the mountains across the Roaring Fork, and sold his share of the house to his brother and sister-in-law. Francis Stanton sold it in 1958, also to move to house on the slopes of Red Mountain.

The murder occurred in Lodelinsart, Charleroi. Sheikh had left her family home after her parents pressured her to marry a cousin who she had never met, later moving in with a Belgian man, but had visited to try to make peace. Her brother confessed to the murder in a 2011 trial, claiming that he had acted alone, but a jury pronounced all four members of the family guilty of the murder and sentenced each to prison. The case has been called Belgium's first honour killing trial. Background Born in Pakistan in 1949, Sheikh's father Tarik Mahmood Sheikh was himself wed by arranged marriage to her mother, Parveen Zahida. Tarik arrived in Belgium in 1973. The children were born in Brussels, and the family lived in Charleroi. Sheikh was a student at the Athénée Royal Vauban; and then Haute Ecole provinciale de Charleroi (HEPCUT), which merged into the . When Sheikh's parents, who owned businesses in both Belgium and Pakistan, attempted to force her to accept an arranged marriage to a cousin she had never met in Pakistan, she instead left home to study law. She felt threatened to the point that she drew up a will at a center for victims of domestic violence. Soon after, she moved in with Jean, a Belgian man her age. Whilst unwilling to comply with her family's demands, she had not surrendered the hope of reconciliation. On 22 October, then in her final year of law school, she visited her family in hopes of mending the rift, but instead she was shot three times. In the shooting, her sister Sariya Sheikh was also wounded by a bullet in the arm. Trial and punishment On 21 November 2011, Sheikh's family—including her parents, brother Mudusar and sister Sariya—stood trial for her death. Sheikh's brother was accused of the shooting, while the rest of the family was accused of aiding and abetting the murder and \\"attempting to arrange a marriage.\\" Prosecutors sought 20 – 30 years for Sariya Sheikh, who they claimed held Sheikh while she was shot, and life imprisonment for the rest of her family. The trial was held in Mons. During the trial, Mudusar Sheikh confessed to the crime, also claiming that he attempted to kill his sister Sariya. Other members of the family also claimed that Mudusar Sheikh was solely responsible for the murder. According to them, he acted in rage, but Mudusar Sheikh himself testified that the act was premeditated. He clarified that \\"I didn't want to take her (Sadia's) life, but to make her feel as bad as I felt.\\" During the trial, evidence had been presented to suggest that Mudusar Sheikh, himself to marry a cousin in Pakistan, had been very close to his sister Sadia, his closest sibling in age. On 9 December 2011, the jury found all four family members guilty of the murder, with the aggravating factor that it was an honour killing, and the brother and father guilty of attempting to force an arranged marriage. Sentencing was handed down on 12 December. The court found that the parents had orchestrated the event, ordering their son to do the shooting. For that reason, although Mudusar Sheikh himself was sentenced to 15 years, Sheikh's mother and father were sentenced to 20 and 25 respectively. The 22-year-old Sariya Sheikh, five months pregnant at the time of sentencing, was given five years, a light sentence due to her youth at the time of the crime. In December 2011 Sheikh's parents were reported to be appealing their sentences. Sariya Sheikh also entered an appeal, to preserve the right, but it was reported she may not follow through if her attorneys do not find sufficient grounds. The case has been called Belgium's first honour killing trial. It has been positioned as a gender equality issue by civil rights groups. During the trial, the courthouse had to be briefly cleared when it received a bomb threat from a person alleging to be part of a Pakistani organization, but the threat proved false. Parveen Zahida was released after six years of prison. Commentary Following the court's verdict, the English-language Pakistani newspaper Dawn commented that Pakistan \\"would do well to take a leaf out of Belgium's book\\" given the regularity of reported honour killings in Pakistan and the common lack of punishment. The editorial laments that the \\"honour-killing debate is still at that mediaeval stage\\" in their country. Aftermath Sadia's burial took place in Pakistan. In popular culture The film A Wedding (2016) is based on this case.

It stars Eddie Izzard, Jason Flemyng and Larry Mills. The BBC film, set in Manchester over two Christmases, shows a group of people who are brought together by a mysterious drifter who helps them find what they have lost. It was released on DVD on 5 November 2012. Synopsis ‘Goose’ is a 10-year-old boy who on Christmas Eve hides his fireman father’s car keys in the hope that he won’t leave when called to an emergency rescue. But his mother gets her keys and drives his dad to work, and ten minutes later they are killed in a car crash. Flash forward a year and it's Christmas Eve once again; we see Goose is no longer the bright, energetic ten-year-old boy he once was, and is now a streetwise kid who is supporting his Nan through petty crime. Enter ‘Anthony’, a mysterious man who appears, seemingly out of nowhere, on Manchester's snowy streets. ‘Anthony’ has no recollection of who he is, where he came from nor where he’s supposed to go but he seems to know things. He can find things that are lost and make lives whole again. Everything starts with a lost bangle. This is where ‘Anthony’ discovers his ability to see what has happened to a person prior to losing what they seek and how they’ve lost what they desire. He touches a person’s hand and sees in his mind their story leading up to the loss of what they are seeking. Despite being lost himself, he has the compulsion and ability to find the lost, uncovering truths that will eventually transform the life of ’Goose’ and those affected by his decision. But is ‘Anthony’s’ ability to heal real, or just an illusion?

It flows in the Vosges département. It is a tributary of the Meurthe, thus a sub-tributary of the Moselle and of the Rhine. It is long. Geography The Fave rises at Lubine at the foot of Climont in the Vosges massif, and flows into the Meurthe at Sainte-Marguerite at the end of its course. It flows through the grassland of the communes of Colroy, Provenchères-sur-Fave, Le Beulay, Frapelle and Neuvillers, passing by the hamlet of Vanifosse in the Pair-et-Grandrupt commune before Remomeix. Its principal tributaries are the \\"Sainte-Catherine\\" stream which comes out of La Grande-Fosse, the \\"Bleu\\" which flows from Lusse and the \\"Morte\\" which flows from Ban-de-Laveline, this latter augmented by the waters of the \\"Blanc Rû\\". The river's name is found in the title of two groupings of communes, the Communauté de communes de la Fave and the Communauté de communes de la Fave et de la Meurthe.  History and toponymy  The river shares its name with the village of Fave, which spread over the middle of the valley well before the 12th century. Having become a hamlet after the 16th century, it was left only a ruin after the Thirty Years War. According to old mountain-dwellers, the source of the Fave was worshipped at Fouillepré upstream of Lubine. According to this cultural model, all the modest tributaries upstream of Lubine, which come from Climont, les Osières, la Jambe de fer and other slopes or small valleys, were referred to as \\"petites Faves\\" (little Faves). Their confluence created the Fave. A probable etymology of the word Fave is from the Old French meaning water which digs or searches. This bears resemblance to the Gaulish \\"murta\\" meaning to dig, gully or laugh, which gave rise to the Meurthe river, to the Morte (a tributary of the Fave which joins in the channels of the low grassland between Neuvillers and Vanifosse), and to the Mortagne, which flows into the Meurthe further downstream. Downstream of Colroy the river has been intensively built on. A part of its waters were diverted with barrages to feed hydraulic installations or mères-royes, a local name for the main fittings used to irrigate humid grassland. More tenuous constructions aided log floating. Hydrology The Fave in the Remomeix commune The Fave is a substantial river considering the relative smallness of its watershed. The mean interannual flow rate or discharge at its confluence with the Meurthe is for a watershed of . The runoff curve number in the watershed is , which is high, almost twice that of the average of France with all watersheds included, and also larger than that of the French Moselle basin by a wide margin. In fact the Moselle's runoff at Hauconcourt, near where it exits France, rises to only . Banque Hydro - Station A7930610 - The Moselle at Hauconcourt (Do not tick the box \\"Station en service\\") The specific flow rate of the Fave comes out at 18.59 litres per second per square kilometre of watershed. Flora and fauna Fish species found in the river include trout, perch, carp, roach. Also present are water scorpions, snails, caddisfly larvae, fish fry, red-eared sliders, rare snakes, crayfish, leeches and dragonfly. Plants include bamboo species and aquatic equisetopsida.

Born into one of Trondheim's wealthiest mercantile families, he travelled to England where he developed a great admiration of English language and literature. Despite his commercial background he was more drawn towards the fields of politics, culture and art. He nevertheless administrated his father's family firm, acting as foreign correspondent with little interest in the everyday business. In England he befriended Lord Byron and came under the influence of the English national liberal movement. Prior to his death, he bequeathed his entire library and several artworks to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters. Early years Knudtzon was born in Trondheim in Sør-Trøndelag; he was the sixth and youngest child of Hans Carl Knudtzon (1751–1823), a merchant and burgomaster, and Karen Knudtzon (née Müller, 1752–1818).Bratberg, \\"Knudtzon.\\" Knudtzon's father was of German origin and had moved to Norway to further his career as a merchant.Bull, \\"Hans Carl Knudtzon.\\" His firm was flourishing financially, and the Knudtzon family became a rallying point for Trondheim's artists and authors. Having spent his childhood in Trondheim, Broder Knudtzon moved to Flensburg, Germany in 1796 to live in the house of his father's uncle.Aase 133. Upon his confirmation, Knudtzon travelled back to Trondheim where he was apprenticed to his father.Bull, \\"Broder Knudtzon.\\" He subsequently travelled around in France in search of a mercantile education; in Paris he met the Danish poet and playwright Adam Oehlenschläger. After a brief visit to his sister in Nantes, he relocated to England, where he came in contact with poet Lord Byron and other leading figures in the national liberal movement. During his stay in England, he acquired a great fondness and knowledge of the English language, literature and culture. In a later trip to Italy he met the Danish-Icelandic sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, who made portrait busts of him and other members of his family. Mercantile and political engagement In the spring of 1814, Broder and his brother Jørgen assisted Carsten Anker in his endeavour to gain English supporters of an independent Norway. As a member of the Storting's deputation to Sweden, Knudtzon travelled with his father to Stockholm in the autumn of the same year. On his return from Stockholm, he became foreign correspondent of his father's firm Hans Knudtzon & Co, which he owned together with his brother Christian and his brother-in-law Lorentz Johannsen.Bratberg, \\"Lorentz Johannsen.\\" He maintained that his own duties in the firm's office were a displeasure, and was once quoted as saying: \\"Business I hate, and for reading there is not leisure\\". A supplementary member of the Storting, he met in the parliament once, acting as secretary for the constitution committee. During 1839–57, he was a member of the supervisory board of Norges Bank. He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1821, and was its secretary from 1825 to 1831. Having a profound wish to spread erudition in Norway, he used his acquaintances in England to supply the society with enlightenment books and journals. Knudtzon eventually bequeathed his entire book collection and five of Thorvaldsen's sculptures to the society, with the condition that they not move to Christiania.Aase 132.Nielsen 159. Death and legacy Knudtzon died unmarried on 20 March 1864 in Trondheim. He was buried in Vår Frue Church, where he also had been christened. Prior to his death, he had burned all his letters and notes, including his correspondences with Lord Byron. Little remains therefore of his written production, aside from a few translations and periodical articles.Aase 134. A biographer once wrote of him: > Mr. Knudtzon is a banker of eminence at Trondheim. He resided some years in > England; hence, to the hospitable kindness of a native of the north and the > acquirements of a literary man he unites the polish and refinement of an > English gentleman.

(Archive) After an occupant set a fire (Archive) (Note: the article mentions 12 deaths but this is not supported by other sources) 11 people died and 15 people were injured. The Pension de Vogel was a hostel for homeless people and people with social problems, such as alcoholism, drug addiction, and psychiatric afflictions. Ans de Vogel (affectionately named Ma Vogel) had run a hostel for such people for 30 years. Originally the hostel was located at the Poeldijksestraat, but it didn't conform to regulations, and after municipal intervention it moved to the Weteringkade and later to the Scheepmakersstraat. In the Scheepmakersstraat building there were 38 small rooms, separated by wooden dividers. There was also a communal living and dining room. The hostel was known to the fire department of The Hague, which had refused it a permit in 1989 because of the lack of fire alarms, fire escapes and fire resistant dividers. Because the building's manager promised to renovate the building, the fire department condoned the situation on the first and second floor above ground level. But the attic was declared off-limits. The fire On the night of 15 to 16 September 1992, more than 50 people were staying at the pension. Because of overcrowding, 10 people stayed in the attic, ignoring the fire department's strong recommendation that that floor not be used. Fire broke out in the early morning of 16 September on the first floor. The fire swiftly crept throughout the building. People were jumping from the windows and from the roof by the time the fire department arrived. Then, while the rescue operations were underway, part of the attic collapsed and the stairwell was soon ablaze. An outside cage ladder was the only safe way out for those still trapped inside, but its existence was unknown to the occupants. 11 of the hostel's occupants died, either from burns or by falling to the ground. Of the 15 injured, 5 were severely wounded. Aftermath After the fire one of the occupants confessed to having started the fire (she had made threats to do so previously, as well). She had bought some petrol at a filling station, and after the building's manager had left at 3:30 CET, she had set her room on fire. The municipality was severely criticised for condoning the situation, and soon issued strict measures and checks for pensions and rented houses, which were followed up nationally.

She is also the founder of Littlestar Services Ltd. Craymer has achieved international popular success in musical theatre, in particular her work on Mamma Mia!, which has been seen by more than 60 million people worldwide. Ten years after the film adaptation grossed more than $600 million around the world, Craymer produced an all-new original movie musical based on the songs of ABBA, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. Since opening in July 2018 the movie has become the most successful live musical movie sequel of all time grossing just less than $400 million. Craymer was nominated for the \\"Carl Foreman award for special achievement by a British director, writer or producer in their first feature film\\" at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards for the film version of Mamma Mia! She has been dubbed \\"the greatest showbiz impresario\\" of the first decade of the 21st century and has consequently been entered in Debrett's . Life and career Born in London in 1957, Judy Craymer graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1977. She worked as a stage manager for the Haymarket Theatre in Leicester, the Old Vic Theatre, London, on the original production of Cats for Cameron Mackintosh and for the Really Useful Theatre Company. In 1982 she became Tim Rice’s production assistant and went on to be executive producer for Chess. In 1987, Craymer moved into film and television production. Her credits include White Mischief, starring Charles Dance and Greta Scacchi, and Neville's Island, starring Martin Clunes and Timothy Spall. Craymer also produced various live comedy specials for Channel 4. In 1999, Craymer returned to her working partnership with Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. She had been nurturing an idea for several years after working with them on Chess which was to become Mamma Mia! It took Craymer 10 years to persuade Andersson and Ulvaeus to give her the rights to the songs. Craymer's inspiration for the musical was the song \\"The Winner Takes It All\\". They were impressed by the team Craymer had gathered around her to create the show; Phyllida Lloyd (a \\"cerebral director blessed with a popular touch\\") and \\"highly savvy writer\\" Catherine Johnson. In 1996 Craymer formed Littlestar Services Ltd with Andersson and Ulvaeus to produce Mamma Mia!, which opened at the Prince Edward Theatre in London's West End on 6 April 1999 and swiftly became a huge global success. Mamma Mia! has become a global juggernaut since 1999, having now played in more than 40 countries in all six continents, and in 16 different languages. It has set the record for premiering in more cities faster than any other musical in history. The show has been nominated for numerous Olivier and Tony awards and was the first West End and Broadway musical to be performed in Chinese. Mamma Mia! is the 8th longest running show in Broadway history and one of only five musicals to have run for more than 10 years on the Great White Way. Mamma Mia! is in its 20th year in London's West End at the Novello Theatre and has grossed over $2 billion at the box office. This success naturally attracted the interest of Hollywood, and in 2005 and 2006 Craymer made a deal with Universal Pictures to make a film of Mamma Mia! Unusually for Hollywood, the project was helmed by the three women who created it, with Craymer, Phyllida Lloyd and Catherine Johnson reprising their roles as producer, director and writer on the film. Mamma Mia!, starring Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski, opened in 2008 and was the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. It is the highest worldwide grossing live action musical film of all time. It is also the UK's fastest and best selling DVD of all time, and in 2013, was announced as Amazon UK's best-selling DVD of all time. More recently, Craymer also produced the flop Viva Forever!, a musical based on the songs of the Spice Girls, which was written by Jennifer Saunders and opened at the Piccadilly Theatre in late 2012. The show failed to reach the levels of other work she was associated with and was panned by critics. Ten years after the film Mamma Mia! grossed more than $600 million around the world, Craymer produced an all-new original movie, extending her initial concept. A meeting with Richard Curtis provided the idea of a prequel/sequel which led to Ol Parker writing and directing Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, reuniting the original cast of Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper, Amanda Seyfried and Christine Baranski to reprise their roles. They were joined by Lily James, Jessica Keenan Wynn, Alexa Davies, Hugh Skinner, Josh Dylan, Jeremy Irvine plus Andy Garcia and Cher joined the Mamma Mia! family. Since opening in July 2018 the movie has become the most successful live musical movie sequel of all time grossing just less than $400 million. Already Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), Craymer was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to theatre and charity. Publications Craymer is the co-author, alongside Abba founder members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, of Mamma Mia! How Can I Resist You, which looks in depth at the songs of Abba as well as the impact of the musical. The book was published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in 2006. The paperback edition, released in 2008, also covers the success of Mamma Mia! The Movie. Other interests Craymer has spent much of her free time in philanthropic and other pursuits. In 2010, she was awarded the \\"Breast Cancer Research Foundation Humanitarian award in memory of Sandra Taub\\", in recognition of her fund raising for Breast Cancer Research, having closely linked Mamma Mia! with the charity’s fundraising efforts. Her early interest in competitive showjumping (\\"Horses were my obsession as a teenager and you never lose that love\\") led to her becoming an ambassador for the sport in 2011. She is also an avid follower of equestrian and National Hunt racing.

In 2010 that the prevalence of childhood obesity during the past two to three decades, much like the United States, has increased in most other industrialized nations, excluding Russia and Poland. Between the early 1970s and late 1990s, prevalence of childhood obesity doubled or tripled in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, the UK, and the USA. A 2010 article from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition analyzed global prevalence from 144 countries in preschool children (less than 5 years old). Cross-sectional surveys from 144 countries were used and overweight and obesity were defined as preschool children with values >3SDs from the mean. They found an estimated 42 million obese children under the age of five in the world of which close to 35 million lived in developing countries.11 Additional findings included worldwide prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity increasing from 4.2% (95% CI: 3.2%, 5.2%) in 1990 to 6.7% (95% CI: 5.6%, 7.7%) in 2010 and expecting to rise to 9.1% (95% CI: 7.3%, 10.9%), an estimated 60 million overweight and obese children in 2020. United States Prevalence of obesity among youth aged 2–19 years, by sex and age: United States, 2015–2016. Childhood obesity in the United States, has been a serious problem among children and adolescents, and can cause serious health problems among our youth. As of 2015-2016, in the United States, 18.5% of children and adolescents have obesity, which affects approximately 13.7 million children and adolescents. Prevalence has remained high over the past three decades across most age, sex, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and represents a three-fold increase from one generation ago and is expected to continue rising. Prevalence of pediatric obesity also varies with state. The highest rates of childhood obesity are found in the southeastern states of which Mississippi was found to have the highest rate of overweight/obese children, 44.5%/21.9% respectively. The western states were found to have the lowest prevalence, such as Utah (23.1%) and Oregon (9.6%). From 2003-2007, there was a twofold increase in states reporting prevalence of pediatric obesity greater than or equal to 18%.7 Oregon was the only state showing decline from 2003 to 2007 (decline by 32%), and using children in Oregon as a reference group, obesity in children in Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Georgia, and Kansas has doubled. The likelihood of obesity in children was found to increase significantly with decreasing levels of household income, lower neighborhood access to parks or sidewalks, increased television viewing time, and increased recreational computer time.Obesity and overweight for professionals: Childhood: Basics  DNPAO  CDC [cited 11/26/2011 2011]. Available fromhttps://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/basics.html (accessed November 26, 2011). Black and Hispanic children are more likely to be obese compared to white (Blacks OR=1.71 and Hispanics=1.76).Obesity and overweight for professionals: Childhood: Basics  DNPAO  CDC [cited 11/26/2011 2011]. Available from https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/basics.html (accessed November 26, 2011).  Prevalence  For the 2015–2016 year, the CDC found that the prevalence of obesity for children aged 2-19 years old, in the U.S., was 18.5%. The current trends show that children aged 12-19 years old, have obesity levels 2.2% higher than children 6-11 years old (20.6% vs. 18.4%), and children 6-11 years old have obesity levels 4.5% higher than children aged 2-5 years old (18.4% vs. 13.9%). Boys, 6-19 years old, have a 6.1% higher prevalence of obesity, than boys aged 2-5 years old (20.4% vs. 14.3%). While girls aged 12-19 years old, have a 7.4% greater prevalence of obesity, than girls aged 2-5 years old (20.9% vs. 13.5%). A 2010 NCHS Data Brief published by the CDC found interesting trends in prevalence of childhood obesity. The prevalence of obesity among boys from households with an income at or above 350% the poverty level was found to be 11.9%, while boys with a household income level at or above 130% of the poverty level was 21.1%. The same trend followed in girls. Girls with a household income at or above 350% of the poverty level has an obesity prevalence of 12.0%, while girls with a household income 130% below the poverty level had a 19.3% prevalence. These trends were not consistent when stratified according to race. “The relationship between income and obesity prevalence is significant among non-Hispanic white boys; 10.2% of those living in households with income at or above 350% of the poverty level are obese compared with 20.7% of those in households below 130% of the poverty level.” The same trend follows in non-Hispanic white girls (10.6% of those living at or above 350% of the poverty level are obese, and 18.3% of those living below 130% of the poverty level are obese) There is no significant trend in prevalence by income level for either boys or girls among non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American children and adolescents. “In fact, the relationship does not appear to be consistent; among Mexican-American girls, although the difference is not significant, 21.0% of those living at or above 350% of the poverty level are obese compared with 16.2% of those living below 130% of the poverty level.” Additional findings also include that the majority of children and adolescents are not low income children. The majority of non-Hispanic white children and adolescents also live in households with income levels at or above 130% of the poverty level. Approximately 7.5 million children live in households with income levels above 130% of the poverty level compared to 4.5 million children in households with income at or above 130% of the poverty level.  Incidence  The importance of identifying the incidence of age-related onset of obesity is vital to understanding when intervention opportunities are most important. Similarly, identifying the incidence of childhood obesity within a respective race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, can also help delineate other areas of intervention opportunities for certain populations. A systematic review on the incidence of childhood obesity, found that childhood obesity in the U.S. declines with age. The age-and-sex related incidence of obesity was found to be \\"4.0% for infants 0–1.9 years, 4.0% for preschool-aged children 2.0–4.9 years, 3.2% for school- aged children 5.0–12.9 years, and 1.8% for adolescents 13.0–18.0 years.\\" When the incidence of childhood obesity, was isolated for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, or for racial/ethnic minority groups, obesity incidence was discovered to be, \\"4.0% at ages 0–1.9 years, 4.1% at 2.0–4.9 years, 4.4% at 5.0–12.9 years, and 2.2% at 13.0–18.0 years.\\" Based on a 2015-2016 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), researchers at Duke University, found that the incidence of childhood obesity is on the rise, with a notable rise in preschool boys (2.0-4.9 years), and girls aged 16.0-19.0 years old. The Duke University researchers also discovered that although it had been believed that obesity in children had been on a decline in recent years, obesity in children at all ages has actually been increasing.

Faculty, students, and staff work in partnership to serve the health issues of the underprivileged Santiago Atitlán community in Guatemala. The goal of GHI is to strengthen clinical services and promote community health in resource-poor Guatemalan communities.  Background  Santiago Atitlán is a poor, close-knit community of 44,220 Tz'utujil Maya speaking inhabitants, of which 98 percent are indigenous. The primary language for ninety four percent of the residents is Tz'utujil; however, 54 percent speak and 13 percent read some Spanish. Residents of Santiago Atitlán are referred to as Atitecos. 80 percent are Catholics, but the traditional Mayan beliefs have endured. Their Mayan rituals, including sacrifices, ensure that the sun, moon, and planets will continue on their paths. In the highlands of Guatemala, especially around Lake Atitlán, the Maya culture still rules. Atitecos are sustained mainly by agriculture, fishing, and tourism. According to the World Bank in 2011, Guatemala had one of the most unequal income distributions, with 51 percent of the population living on less than a day and fifteen percent on less than a day. While over half of the population of Guatemala lives in extreme poverty, within the rural indigenous Maya areas of Santiago Atitlán this poverty level raises to 91 percent. Guatemala's social development indicators, such as maternal and infant mortality, chronic child malnutrition, and illiteracy, are among the worst in the hemisphere. Santiago Atitlán has the worst access to healthcare in Guatemala. This and other indigenous communities in the Guatemala highlands suffer extremely high rates of maternal and infant mortality with many obstetrical complications, and high levels of pre-eclampsia. Despite criticism of chlorination, 90 percent of residents do get their drinking water from household or public taps, but many still drink from contaminated sources or self-treat the water. Public health water interventions need to address the inequalities related to these underlying factors in order to achieve maximum effectiveness.In Guatemala, 23 percent of households contain a growth stunted child with an overweight mother. Poor diets were associated with these disparities. Many Global Health Programs: governmental, non-governmental (NGO), private, and voluntary organizations work to support the people of Guatemala. The World Health Organization (WHO) directs international health activities, supplies training and technical assistance, develops standards, disseminates health information, promotes research, collects and analyzes epidemiologic data, and develops systems for monitoring and evaluating health programs in Guatemala. The Global Health Initiative sponsored by United States Government, targets women, newborns and children under five in Guatemala. It concentrates support efforts, aligning the NGOs and engaging the private sector in reducing maternal and infant mortality, increasing access to voluntary family planning services, prevention of HIV and other communicable diseases and improving health systems and health services. In addition to these large organizations, private voluntary organizations contribute twenty percent of the external health aid to distressed areas. History of GHI GHI, a voluntary organization, established a partnership with the Hospitalito Atitlán in the summer of 2005, when University of Pennsylvania medical and nursing student volunteers conducted a community health assessment in Guatemala. The predecessor to Hospitalito Atitlán, Clínica Santiaguito, opened in the 1960s. The Clinica was abandoned, after the massacre of thirteen Atitecos by the Guatemalan Army in 1990, leaving the town without medical services. In 2002, K'aslimaal, a grassroots organization, began to raise funds and make plans to reconstruct the hospital. Through their efforts, Hospitalito Atitlán opened on April 1, 2005, providing in-patient, surgical, and 24-hour emergency care to the people of Santiago Atitlán. Barely six months after opening, on October 5, 2005, mudslides triggered by Hurricane Stan buried Hospitalito Atitlán in eight feet of mud. The mud slide destroyed the town and killed hundreds, and the area was declared a mass grave. Two Penn medical students were present during the disaster and participated in the relief efforts. Through the heroism of hospital staff and volunteers, and the generosity of donors, Hospitalito Atitlán, amazingly, re-opened just two weeks later in a temporary location. Groundbreaking for a new permanent building for Hospitalito Atitlán began on September 30, 2006. In November 2010, the first floor of the new hospital opened. Kent Bream, founding faculty director of the GHI, helped to rebuild the Hospitalito Atitlán that was destroyed in 2005. Bream trains students and coordinates interdisciplinary research, education, and service programming involving the Penn Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Wharton to improve the health of the Atitlan community GHI partners with Hospitalito Atitlán, a small, private, non-profit hospital in Santiago Atitlan in the western highlands of Guatemala. Santiago Atitlan, the largest indigenous village in Central America, sits on the southern shore of Lake Atitlán. The word \\"atitlan\\" is a Mayan word that translates as \\"the place where the rainbow gets its colors\\". 2011 update Hospitalito Atitlán is a flourishing health organization that offers curative and preventative hospital services in the poverty stricken Atitlán area. Medical care is accessible to all, with a focus on women and children. Social Workers are available to evaluate the resources of the patient and family and provide up to a one hundred percent discount for those with limited resources Local physicians, nursing, and administrative staff work closely in collaboration with volunteer medical personnel from around the world to provide a comprehensive scope of care, including the only 24/7 emergency and surgical obstetrical care within a 2-hour radius. For the many patients that speak only Tz'utujil. Hospitalito Atitlán staff translates Tz'tujil to Spanish. The mission of Guatemala Health Initiative is to work with Hospitalito Atitlán to strengthen the medical services in a socially relevant and ethically acceptable way in resource-poor Tz'ulujil Maya community of Santiago Atitlán in Guatemala. GHI collaborates with the Hospitalito Atitlán to improve the health of Atitecos by increasing clinical activities and community health promotion via community health research, personnel, and material support. GHI provides education through video tapes, lectures and community health projects. GHI strives to educate mothers on the importance of prenatal care, safe deliveries, and postnatal care. GHI informs residents about the pulmonary problems that arise from the open cooking fires in homes and the importance of safe drinking water. Central to the goal of GHI is to put the knowledge gained through participatory research and clinical and cultural experiences into developing effective, sustainable, and culturally sensitive health interventions. A number of potential collaborative projects between Penn and its Guatemalan partners are being conducted or explored, including scientific and clinical training with bilateral exchanges of students and faculty, as well as research on issues related to: violence prevention, food and nutrition, road traffic safety, chronic disease and trauma treatment. In 2011, Bream, students, medical school librarians, and hospital IT specialists brought the Penn mobile technology project to Hospitalito Atitlán. The Penn mobile technology project, a most promising telemedicine program, uses smart phones and other mobile technologies to improve physicians' access to clinical information in Guatemala. The smart phone technology allows images and information to be relayed to Penn doctors for instantaneous diagnosis and second opinions. They can also use electronic devices to tap into extensive electronic medical databases and e-journals to get information on diseases and treatment options. This immediate access to medical information will advance the quality of care in this rural area. GHI raises funds, procures medical supplies, and provides personnel support for Hospitalito Atitlán. Penn medical and nursing student rotations benefit both Penn and Hospitalito Atitlán. The GHI also informs the Penn community about health and human rights in Guatemala.

He first appeared on the 23rd season of Survivor, Survivor: South Pacific, and came in eighth place. He returned for the 26th season, Survivor: Caramoan, and ultimately won the title of Sole Survivor and the $1 million prize. He later went on to become a writer for various CBS sitcoms, including The Millers and, more recently, Kevin Can Wait.  Personal life  Cochran was born in Washington, D.C., to a family of Jewish background. He was raised in Oakton, Virginia, and attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School. Even at a young age, Cochran was already a fan of Survivor, following the show since the very first season, even writing a law school paper comparing the jury system of Survivor to the American jury system. During high school, he handed out Survivor newsletters, wore a Survivor-style buff on his arm when the show was airing, and chose his senior year quote as \\"The tribe has spoken.\\" Survivor South Pacific Cochran was originally placed on the Savaii tribe and ended up receiving at least one vote in every Tribal Council that Savaii attended, with one vote in their first, second, and fourth Tribal Councils, and two votes in their third Tribal Council. In the last episode before the merge, returning player Ozzy Lusth, in an effort to end the winning streak of Christine Shields-Markoski on Redemption Island, asked his tribe to vote him out, saying that he would tell Shields-Markoski that his elimination was caused by Cochran using a Hidden Immunity Idol. Lusth subsequently gave Cochran the Immunity Idol he had found, making him promise to return it when he came back to the game. When the merge finally came, Cochran returned the Idol and then pretended to be the outsider of his former tribe when speaking to the other returning player, Benjamin \\"Coach\\" Wade. However, Wade quickly realized Cochran's intentions and instead decided to persuade Cochran into voting with the former Upolu members, promising him that he would outlast all of his former tribemates. When the vote that night came down to a split vote and the contestants had to vote again, it was Cochran who switched his vote and sent home former tribemate Keith Tollefson. He was immediately criticized by all of his former tribemates, but the former Upolu members, including Brandon Hantz, came to his defense. Soon afterward, all other former Savaii members were voted out in succession, with Lusth, Jim Rice, Dawn Meehan, and Whitney Duncan all being sent home. However, once Cochran was the last Savaii member left, the former Upolu members turned on him and voted him out by a vote of 5–2, with only Cochran himself and former Upolu member Edna Ma voting for Rick Nelson instead. After losing the Redemption Island duel to Lusth, Cochran came in eighth place, having lasted for 31 days; he became the fifth member of the nine-member jury. In the final Tribal Council, Cochran voted for Wade to win, along with Nelson and Ma. These three votes made Wade the runner- up to Sophie Clarke, who received the other six votes. Caramoan Cochran returned for the 26th season, the second season to be subtitled \\"Fans vs. Favorites,\\" and was placed on the \\"Favorites\\" tribe, Bikal. He was joined by fellow South Pacific contestants Brandon Hantz and Dawn Meehan. Cochran once again aligned with a majority of his tribemates, under the alliance name of \\"Stealth R Us,\\" named so by the unofficial tribe leader Phillip Sheppard. Even after the tribal swap in Episode Six, Cochran still remained on the Bikal tribe, along with Sheppard, Meehan, fellow returning player Corinne Kaplan, and newcomers Julia Landauer, Matt Bischoff, and Michael Snow. The new Bikal tribe focused on eliminating all of the new players on the tribe, successfully voting out Bischoff and Landauer before the merge came. However, when Sheppard was eliminated due to a blindside by Malcolm Freberg, Reynold Toepfer, and Eddie Fox, Cochran became the default leader due to being viewed as Sheppard's right-hand man. Over the course of the season, Cochran went on to win three individual immunity challenges, in Episodes 8, 11, and 14. He was also the only contestant in the season to win more than one individual immunity challenge. He would make a major move to plot the blindside of potential threat Brenda Lowe at the Final Six. Lowe had been plotting to blindside Cochran at either the Final Five or Final Four. After a crucial win at the Final Four immunity challenge to secure his place in the finals, and with Sherri Biethman the easiest finals opponent, he would debate bringing Fox or his closest ally Meehan. He decided on Meehan, realizing that Fox, despite floating through the game, had numerous good friends on the jury and was the bigger threat. When it came down to the jury presentations, Cochran received nearly unanimous praise for the way he played the game strategically without letting emotions interfere, and for always sticking to his promises. Biethman was considered to have ridden coattails to the end, and Meehan was criticized for her emotional instability. Ultimately, Cochran won a unanimous 8–0–0 vote. He became only the third winner in Survivor history to win a unanimous vote, after Earl Cole in Survivor: Fiji and J.T. Thomas in Survivor: Tocantins. He was also only the second winner to win a unanimous vote while also never receiving a single vote against him in any Tribal Council, after Thomas. Cameos Cochran showed up on the reunion show for Survivor: Blood vs. Water, the show's 27th season. Jeff Probst asked Cochran about new developments in his life, and even presented a comedy sketch starring Cochran and actor Will Arnett.Survivor: Blood vs. Water reunion show, CBS, December 15, 2013 Cochran later appeared as a guest on the fifth episode of Survivor's 34th season, Survivor: Game Changers, where he visited exiled castaway Debbie Wanner to give her advice. Popularity After Caramoan ended, Cochran was inducted into Xfinity's Survivor \\"Hall of Fame,\\" as part of the class of 2013, alongside Kim Spradlin and Jonny Fairplay. Several years later, in the official issue of CBS Watch magazine commemorating the 15th anniversary of Survivor, Cochran was voted as the seventh greatest player of all time. Additionally, in a 2015 interview shortly before the premiere of the 30th season, host Jeff Probst declared Cochran to be his favorite season winner ever. Television writing Shortly after his second Survivor appearance, Probst put Cochran into contact with Greg Garcia, creator of and writer for The Millers. Garcia offered Cochran a job as a writer for the show. Cochran accepted the job, and after graduating from Harvard Law, moved to Los Angeles to begin working on the show. Although the series was canceled shortly thereafter, Cochran landed another writing gig on Kevin Can Wait a few years later.

They are regularly found among vegetation in floating meadows, a habitat that often contains little oxygen, but they are well-adapted to this. They are well-camouflaged and brown in color with a banded/mottled pattern.

Despite long and distinguished service, toward the end of the Republic the reputation of this gens suffered as a result of the conspiracy of Catiline.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol.

Origin The Sergii claimed descent from Sergestus, one of the Trojans who came to Italy with Aeneas, a tradition mentioned by Vergil in the Aeneid.Vergil, Aeneid, v. 121. The etymology of the nomen Sergius is problematic. Chase hesitantly suggests a connection with the praenomen Servius, probably from an old Latin root meaning to preserve or keep safe. He classifies the nomen with other gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.Chase, pp. 131, 154, 155.

II, p. 149 (\\"Fidenas\\") Praenomina The main praenomen of the Sergia gens was Lucius, which was used by all branches of the family at all periods. Gaius was also used from the earliest times, while Marcus was favoured by the Sergii Sili. All of these were among the most common praenomina throughout Roman history. The only other name regularly used by the Sergii was Manius, a relatively distinctive praenomen favoured by a few gentes, which belonged to one of the most illustrious of the Sergii of the early Republic, and was still in use after the Second Punic War. Other praenomina appear infrequently. Branches and cognomina The cognomina of the Sergii during the Republic were Catilina, Esquilinus, Fidenas, Orata, Paulus, Plancus, and Silus. Some of the Sergii who appear in history had no surname. Fidenas, the surname of the oldest distinct family of the Sergii, is said to have been obtained by Lucius Sergius Fidenas, the consul of 437 BC. The year before his consulship, the Romans had put down a revolt at Fidenae, an ancient Latin city about five miles north of Rome; the implication perhaps being that Sergius had participated in the recovery of the city. However, it may be that Sergius, or one of his ancestors, was a native of that city, where a Roman colony was said to have existed since the early monarchial period.Livy, i. 27. One of the Fidenates bore the additional surname Coxo, applied to one with prominent hips.Chase, p. 110. Esquilinus originally designated someone who lived on the Esquiline Hill, one of the Seven Hills of Rome, may have been a personal cognomen, as only one of the Sergii is known to have borne it. This cognomen belongs to a common class of surnames derived from the place of a person's origin or residence.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 53 (\\"Esquilinus\\").Chase, pp. 113, 114. The most distinguished family of the Sergii during the latter part of the Republic bore the cognomen Silus, originally describing someone with an upturned nose. The first of this branch rose to fame during the Second Punic War, but by the time of Catiline, who was his great-grandson, they had fallen into poverty and obscurity.Chase, p. 109.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 827 (\\"Silus\\", \\"Sergius Silus\\"). Of other surnames, Orata or Aurata, golden, was the surname of a wealthy merchant of the Sergian gens, who is said to have obtained it either because of his substantial gold rings, or because he kept goldfish.Festus, s. v. Orata. Meanwhile, Plancus, referring to someone with flat or splayed feet, belongs to a common class of surnames derived from the physical characteristics of the bearer. This is amended by some scholars to Plautus, although the meaning is nearly identical.Broughton, vol. I, p. 226 (note 2). Members Sergii Fidenates * Lucius Sergius C. f. C. n.

Along with the single \\"My Sweet Lord\\", it is among the more overtly religious compositions on All Things Must Pass, and the recording typifies co-producer Phil Spector's influence on the album, due to his liberal use of reverberation and other Wall of Sound production techniques. Harrison recorded the track in London backed by musicians such as Eric Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, Klaus Voormann, Jim Gordon and Jim Price – many of whom he had toured with, as Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, in December 1969, while still officially a member of the Beatles. Musically, the composition reflects Harrison's embracing of the gospel music genre, following his production of fellow Apple Records artists Billy Preston and Doris Troy. In his lyrics to \\"Awaiting on You All\\", Harrison espouses a direct relationship with God over adherence to the tenets of organised religion. Influenced by both his association with London-based Hare Krishna devotees, known as the Radha Krishna Temple, and the Vedanta-inspired teachings of Swami Vivekananda, Harrison sings of chanting God's name as a means to cleanse and liberate oneself from the impurities of the material world. While acknowledging the validity of all faiths, in essence, his song words explicitly criticise the Pope and the perceived materialism of the Catholic Church – a verse that EMI and Capitol Records continue to omit from the album's lyrics. He also questions the validity of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's 1969 campaign for world peace, reflecting a divergence of philosophies between Harrison and his former bandmate after their shared interest in Hindu spirituality in 1967–68. Several commentators have identified \\"Awaiting on You All\\" as one of the highlights of All Things Must Pass; author and critic Richard Williams likens it to the Spector-produced \\"River Deep – Mountain High\\", by Ike & Tina Turner. The track is featured in the books 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die by Robert Dimery and 1001 Songs by Toby Creswell. A similarly well-regarded live version, with backing from a large band including Clapton, Ringo Starr, Preston and Jim Keltner, was released on the 1971 album The Concert for Bangladesh and appeared in the 1972 film of the same name. Harrison's posthumous compilation Early Takes: Volume 1 (2012) includes a demo version of the song, recorded early in the 1970 sessions for All Things Must Pass. Background In his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Simon Leng describes George Harrison's musical projects outside the Beatles during 1969–70 – such as producing American gospel and soul artists Billy Preston and Doris Troy, and touring with Delaney & Bonnie and Friends – as the completion of \\"a musical-philosophical circle\\", which resulted in his post-Beatles solo album All Things Must Pass (1970).Leng, pp. 62, 83, 319. Among the songs on that triple album, \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Awaiting on You All\\" each reflect Harrison's immersion in Krishna Consciousness,Leng, pp. 71, 83.Allison, pp. 46, 47. via his association with the UK branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), known as the Radha Krishna Temple.Clayson, pp. 267–68. An ISKCON devotee since 1970, author Joshua Greene writes of All Things Must Pass providing an \\"intimately detailed account of a spiritual journey\\", which had begun with Harrison's embracing of Hinduism while in India in September–October 1966.Greene, pp. 70–72, 181, 190. Having long disavowed the Catholic faith of his upbringing,Allison, pp. 40, 42–44. from 1966 Harrison was inspired by the teachings of Indian yogi Swami Vivekananda.Greene, pp. 68–69.Olivia Harrison, \\"A Few Words About George\\", in The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 10. The latter's contention that \\"Each soul is potentially divine, the goal is to manifest that divinity\\" particularly resonated with Harrison in its contrast to the doctrine of the Catholic Church.Tillery, pp. 58, 107. By 1967, Harrison's religious awakening had progressed to include Gaudiya Vaishnava chanting,Greene, pp. 80–81, 145. a form of meditation that he shared with his Beatles bandmate John LennonTillery, pp. 58–59, 69, 109.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 36. and would go on to espouse in \\"Awaiting on You All\\".Allison, pp. 47, 122. Further to Vivekananda's assertion, chanting the Hare Krishna or other Sanskrit-worded mantras has, author Gary Tillery writes, \\"the ability to send spiritual energy through the body, leading to the enlightenment of the person chanting\\".Tillery, p. 89. Whereas Lennon's interest in spiritual matters waned following the Beatles' visit to India in 1968,Tillery, pp. 63, 64–65.Schaffner, pp. 88–89.Greene, p. 97. Harrison's involvement with the Radha Krishna Temple led to him producing two hit singles by the devotees over 1969–70, \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\" and \\"Govinda\\".Lavezzoli, p. 195.Clayson, pp. 246, 268–69, 439. While Lennon and his partner, Yoko Ono, undertook a highly publicised campaign for world peace during 1969,Doggett, pp. 89–91.Wiener, pp. xvii, 91–92, 113. Harrison believed that all human suffering could be averted if individuals focused on addressing their own imperfections rather than, as he put it, \\"trying to fix everybody else up like the Lone Ranger\\".Greene, p. 156.Clayson, pp. 256, 266–67. This divergence in philosophy also formed part of Harrison's subject matter for \\"Awaiting on You All\\", a song that, Greene writes, \\"projected his message to the world\\". Composition In an October 1974 radio interview with Alan Freeman,Madinger & Easter, p. 445. Harrison recalled writing \\"Awaiting on You All\\" while preparing to go to bed, and mentioned it as a composition that had come easily to him.George Harrison: Living in the Material World, Disc 2; event occurs between 25:23 and 25:40. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison states that his inspiration for the song was \\"Japa Yoga meditation\\",Harrison, p. 200. whereby mantras are sung and counted out on prayer beads.Allison, pp. 58, 136. Musically, the composition has elements of gospel and rock music; Leng describes it as \\"gospel-drenched\\" and cites Harrison's production of \\"Sing One for the Lord\\", which Preston recorded with the Edwin Hawkins Singers in early 1970, as a \\"catalyst\\" for the new composition.Leng, p. 71. The song opens with a descending guitar riff,Huntley, p. 59. later repeated after each chorus, which ends on the melody's root chord of B major.Harrison, front endpapers. In his lyrics to \\"Awaiting on You All\\", Harrison conveys the importance of experiencing spirituality directly, while rejecting organised religion as well as political and intellectual substitutes.Leng, p. 95. Author Ian Inglis writes that the lyrics recognise the merit in all faiths, as Harrison sings that the key to any religion is to \\"open up your heart\\".Inglis, p. 30. The choruses proclaim that individual freedom from the physical or material world can be attained through \\"chanting the names of the Lord\\",Allison, pp. 47, 122, 124. implying that there is a single deity who happens to be called by different names depending on the faith.Stowe, p. 53. Montreal \\"Bed-in for Peace\\" The song's three versesHarrison, pp. 203–04. provide a list of items or concepts that are unnecessary to this realisation. The opening lines – \\"You don't need no love- in / You don't need no bed pan\\" – serve as a criticism of Lennon and Ono's bed-ins and other forms of peace activism during 1969. While Inglis views these words as indicative of a possible rift in Harrison's relationship with Lennon, Leng identifies the \\"tongue-lashing for John and Yoko\\" as the singer dismissing \\"all political-cum-intellectual musings\\". Harrison then uses what Christian theologian Dale Allison terms \\"the language of pollution\\" to describe the problems afflicting the world,Allison, p. 32. and offers a method by which to cleanse oneself spiritually. In verse two,Harrison, p. 203. Harrison sings of the futility of passports and travel for those searching to \\"see Jesus\\", since an open heart will reveal that Christ is \\"right there\\".Allison, p. 55. Allison remarks on the song expressing Harrison's \\"syncretistic view of Jesus\\", a view he shared with Lennon, and cites comments that Harrison later made to Radha Krishna Temple co-founderMuster, p. 26. Mukunda Goswami, that Christ was \\"an absolute yogi\\" yet modern-day Christian teachers misrepresent him and \\"[let] him down very badly\\".Allison, pp. 54–56, 59, 136. Pope Paul VI, whose papal office in 1970 Harrison scorned in his song lyrics In the song's final verse,Harrison, p. 204. Harrison states that churches, temples, religious texts and the rosary beads associated with Catholic worship are no substitute for a direct relationship with God. These symbols of organised religion \\"meant searching in the wrong places\\", Tillery writes, when in keeping with Vivekananda's philosophy, \\"the spark of the divine is within us all. Every person is therefore the child of God ...\\"Tillery, pp. 58, 89. AllMusic critic Lindsay Planer comments on Harrison's \\"observation of [religious] repression\\" in the lines \\"We've been kept down so long / Someone's thinking that we're all green.\\" Harrison's most scathing criticism is directed at the Pope, in the lines: \\"While the Pope owns 51% of General Motors / And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us.\\" Contrasting this statement with Harrison's song-wide message that God \\"waits on us to wake up and open our hearts\\", Allison concludes: \\"whereas the Lord is about the business of helping human beings to wake up, the Pope is about the business of business.\\"Allison, pp. 42, 129. In his book No Sympathy for the Devil, Dave Ware Stowe writes of the effect of \\"Awaiting on You All\\" on Evangelical Christian sensibilities: \\"this was dangerous stuff. Harrison's lyrics exemplified what many in the Jesus Movement considered a lure and snare of the devil. No doubt the song was spiritually resonant, even reverent, but it leaves the all-important object of veneration vague.\\"Stowe, pp. 53–54. While identifying a similar ISKCON-inspired theme in Harrison's 1973 song \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\", Allison discusses \\"Awaiting on You All\\" as a precedent for further statements by Harrison against organised religion, particularly Catholicism. Among these, Harrison parodied the Last Supper in his inner-gatefold artwork for Living in the Material World (1973),Spizer, p. 256. dressed as a Catholic priest and again mocking the \\"perceived materialism and violence of the Roman church\\", according to Allison.Allison, p. 42. In addition, in his role as film producer, Harrison supported Monty Python's controversial parodying of the biblical story of Christ in Life of Brian (1979),Rodriguez, pp. 114–15. about which he said: \\"Actually, [the film] was upholding Him and knocking all the idiotic stuff that goes on around religion.\\"Clayson, pp. 370–71. Production Phil Spector's involvement Harrison and American producer Phil Spector began discussing the possibility of Harrison recording a solo album of songs in early 1970,Doggett, p. 115. after they had worked together on Lennon's Plastic Ono Band single \\"Instant Karma!\\"Spizer, p. 28. Before then, to show his support for Spector's comeback from self-imposed retirement, Harrison had supplied a written endorsement of the producer's work on the Ike & Tina Turner album River Deep – Mountain High, when A&M; Records issued the three-year-old recordings in 1969.Williams, pp. 137–38.Ribowsky, p. 250. Long a fan of Spector's sound,Woffinden, p. 31. Harrison praised River Deep – Mountain High with the words: \\"a perfect record from start to finish. You couldn't improve on it.\\"Williams, pp. 137–38, 153. Beatles biographer Peter Doggett suggests that Harrison had intended to make an entire album of devotional songs but, with that not being \\"an appropriate dish to set before Phil Spector\\", Harrison chose to delay starting work on All Things Must Pass and instead continued his activities with the Radha Krishna Temple.Doggett, p. 117. It was only after Paul McCartney's departure from the Beatles, and the band's break- up,Schaffner, p. 138. that Harrison finally began sessions for his solo album – in late May 1970, at Abbey Road Studios in London.Badman, p. 10. Noting Spector's application of his signature Wall of Sound production on \\"Awaiting on You All\\", Inglis writes that, but for Harrison's lyrics, the song \\"could be mistaken for the instrumental track of a song by the Ronettes\\",Inglis, p. 29. one of Spector's girl-group protégés during the 1960s. Recording The line-up of musicians on the basic track included Harrison and Eric Clapton, on electric guitars; bassists Klaus Voormann and Carl Radle, one of whom plays six-string bass; and drummer Jim Gordon, who formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton and Radle during the sessions.Spizer, pp. 212, 220, 224. In addition, Bobby Whitlock, the fourth member of the Dominos – all of whom were formerly part of Delaney & Bonnie and FriendsLeng, pp. 63–64. – recalls playing Hammond organ on the song. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter note the presence of a piano part on the recording as well. Derek and the Dominos, including Bobby Whitlock (third from left), founded in 1970 by former members of Delaney & Bonnie's band In his 2010 autobiography, Whitlock writes of Lennon and Ono visiting the studio during the All Things Must Pass sessions, during which Lennon \\"got his socks blown off\\" by the music Harrison was recording.Whitlock, p. 77. The Hare Krishna devotees regularly attended the sessions also;Harris, pp. 72–73. Spector later cited their presence as an example of how Harrison inspired tolerance in non-believers, since the Temple devotees could be \\"the biggest pain in the necks in the world\\", according to Spector.Phil Spector interview, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World, Disc 2; event occurs between 20:54 and 21:13. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Among the many unreleased songs from the All Things Must Pass sessions, Harrison recorded his all-Sanskrit composition \\"Gopala Krishna\\",Madinger & Easter, pp. 433–34. which Leng describes as \\"a rocking companion to 'Awaiting on You All'\\".Leng, p. 78. Madinger and Easter view \\"Awaiting on You All\\" as one of the more \\"heavily Spectorized\\" productions on All Things Must Pass,Madinger & Easter, p. 431. due to Spector's liberal use of echo and other Wall of Sound techniques.Leng, pp. 96, 102. Among the extensive overdubs on the basic track, Harrison added what Leng terms a \\"virtual guitar orchestra\\" of harmonised slide guitar parts,Leng, p. 96. and former Delaney & Bonnie musiciansClayson, p. 278. Jim Price and Bobby Keys supplied horns.Spizer, p. 224. Whitlock and Clapton sang backing vocals with Harrison,Whitlock, p. 81. credited on the album as \\"the George O'Hara-Smith Singers\\".Spizer, p. 212. The recording also features prominent percussion such as tambourine and maracas.Williams, p. 153. While the precise line-up on many of the songs on All Things Must Pass continues to invite conjecture,Leng, p. 82fn.Rodriguez, p. 76. Badfinger drummer Mike Gibbins has said that Spector nicknamed him \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" due to his role on that instrument throughout the sessions,Harris, p. 72. and that he and future Yes drummer Alan White played most of the percussion parts on the album, \\"switch[ing] on tambourine, sticks, bells, maracas ... whatever was needed\\".Matovina, p. 90. Release Apple Records released All Things Must Pass on 27 November 1970,Spizer, p. 219. with \\"Awaiting on You All\\" sequenced as the penultimate track on side three, in the original LP format, preceding the album's title song.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 94. Of the 23 tracks released on All Things Must Pass, it was one of the few overtly religious songs.Rodriguez, p. 148. Concerned at the potential offensiveness of the lyrics, EMI omitted verse three of \\"Awaiting on You All\\" from the lyric sheet. Madinger and Easter write that the lyrical content of this verse \\"probably shot down any chances of it being the hit single it could otherwise have been\\". Issued during a period when rock music was increasingly reflecting spiritual themes,Clayson, pp. 294–95. All Things Must Pass was a major commercial success,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 40.Lavezzoli, p. 186. outselling releases that year by Harrison's former bandmates,Ribowsky, pp. 182–83.Huntley, p. 63. and topping albums charts throughout the world.Madinger & Easter, p. 427. Describing the impact of the album, with reference to \\"Awaiting on You All\\"'s exhortation to \\"chant the names of the Lord\\", author Nicholas Schaffner wrote of Harrison being \\"rewarded with a Number One single all over the world\\" with \\"My Sweet Lord\\".Schaffner, p. 142. Reception On release, Rolling Stone critic Ben Gerson described \\"Awaiting on You All\\" as \\"a Lesley Gore rave-up in which George manages to rhyme 'visas' with 'Jesus'\\". While he considered that lyrics such as \\"You've been polluted so long\\" \\"carry an air of sanctimoniousness and moral superiority which is offensive\\", Gerson added: \\"Remarkably, he vindicates these lapses.\\" Writing for the same magazine 30 years later, Anthony DeCurtis opined that \\"the heart of All Things Must Pass resides in its songs of spiritual acceptance\\", and grouped \\"Awaiting on You All\\" with \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass\\" as Harrison compositions that \\"capture the sweet satisfactions of faith\\". In his 1970 review for the NME, Alan Smith described \\"Awaiting on You All\\" as \\"a rapid fire thumper with good chord progressions\\" and \\"one of the better tracks\\" on the album.Smith, Alan (5 December 1970). \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass (Apple)\\". NME. p. 2. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).Hunt, p. 32. AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger views \\"Awaiting on You All\\" as a highlight of a collection on which \\"nearly every song is excellent\\", while author and critic Bob Woffinden lists it with \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and \\"What Is Life\\" as \\"all excellent songs\\".Woffinden, p. 38. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams writes that, unlike Lennon and McCartney on their 1970 solo albums, \\"Harrison concentrated on pure joyous melodies – the kind of songs that had made the group so loved\\", and he says of \\"Awaiting on You All\\": \\"Spector repaid Harrison for his benediction on the Ike and Tina Turner album cover by turning it into a virtual remake of 'River Deep – Mountain High'.\\"Williams, pp. 152–53. Mark Ribowsky, another Spector biographer, writes of the producer's contribution to this and other songs on All Things Must Pass: \\"Phil's rhythmically pounding basses and drum feels sutured George's sentimentality with cheerful energy and made Indian asceticism into dance music.\\"Ribowsky, p. 255. Simon Leng describes \\"Awaiting on You All\\" as a \\"hot gospel stomper\\" and \\"the most successful example of Spector's work on the album\\".Leng, pp. 95, 96. Writing for NME Originals in 2005, Adrian Thrills named \\"Awaiting on You All\\" and \\"Wah-Wah\\" as examples of \\"a tendency to over-egg the mix\\" on the otherwise \\"magnificent\\" All Things Must Pass, adding: \\"it is hard to think of another big rock album on which the tambourine is shaken quite so relentlessly.\\"Hunt, p. 22. In his AllMusic article on the song, Lindsay Planer views it as \\"somewhat of a sacred rocker\\" with \\"ample lead guitar\\", and comments that Harrison's lyrics \\"cleverly [draw] upon an array of disparate imagery to convey a conversely simple spiritual revelation\\". Harrison biographer Alan Clayson considers the track \\"more uplifting\\" than \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and remarks on the aptness of Harrison's subject matter in 1970–71, when religious texts such as the Bible, the Koran and ISKCON's Chant and Be Happy \\"now had discreet places on hip bookshelves\\".Clayson, pp. 293, 294, 295. Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes the song as \\"glorious white gospel\\", in which Harrison \\"rejects the Catholicism of his Liverpool upbringing\\".Snow, p. 25. \\"Awaiting on You All\\" has featured in the music reference books 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die by Robert DimeryDimery, pp. 12, 270, 921. and 1001 Songs by Australian critic Toby Creswell. The latter describes the combination of Harrison's \\"tasteful\\" guitar parts and the \\"galloping\\" rhythm section as \\"sublime and divine\\".Creswell, p. 622. In Dimery's book, contributor Bruno MacDonald writes of the track: \\"'Awaiting on You All' has a timeless exuberance that even Beatles-haters should experience.\\"Dimery, p. 270. Live version \\"Awaiting on You All\\" was one of the songs Harrison played at the Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 August 1971.Badman, pp. 43–44. Featuring backing from a band including Clapton, Voormann, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, Jim Keltner and Jim Horn,Lavezzoli, pp. 190, 192. Harrison performed the song at both the afternoon and the evening shows.Madinger & Easter, pp. 436–37. The latter performance was included on the Concert for Bangladesh live album, which Spector again co-produced,Spizer, pp. 241, 242. and in the film of the concert.Madinger & Easter, p. 438. Joshua Greene comments on there being a \\"logical chronology\\" to the first three songs in Harrison's setlist for this second show: \\"starting with 'Wah Wah,' which declared his independence from the Beatles; followed by 'My Sweet Lord,' which celebrated his internal discovery of God and spirit; and then 'Awaiting on You All'\\".Greene, p. 190. Writing in Rolling Stone, Jon Landau compared the less- polished performance of \\"Awaiting on You All\\" with the studio version's \\"perfect production\\" and concluded: \\"it is exhilarating to hear his voice clearly singing the song for the first time, likewise the excellent guitar.\\" In his album review for Melody Maker, Williams wrote of Harrison's opening trio of songs: \\"Unbelievably, they're as good as the originals, and in some ways even better, because they combine the power of the arrangements for horns and rhythm with a sense of joy that comes only in live performance. The two drummers (Ringo and Jim Keltner) are just breathtaking on 'Awaiting' ...\\"Williams, Richard (1 January 1972). \\"The Concert for Bangla Desh (album review)\\". Melody Maker. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Planer also compliments what he calls \\"the tag-team percussion\\" of Starr and Keltner, which \\"driv[es] through the heart of the performance\\". Reissue and other versions In February 2001, during his extensive promotion for the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass,Huntley, pp. 304, 308–09.

Gnome Records/EMI. 2001. In the CD booklet, Harrison's liner notes conclude with a thank-you to \\"the amazing Mr. Phil Spector\\" and the acknowledgement: \\"He helped me so much to get this record made. In his company I came to realise the true value of the Hare Krishna Mantra.\\" The Pope-related lyrics in \\"Awaiting on You All\\" were again omitted from the booklet; they similarly do not appear on the lyric sheet supplied with the 2014 Apple Years reissue. Part of the 2001 playback scene was included in Martin Scorsese's documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World,George Harrison: Living in the Material World, Disc 2; event occurs between 26:01 and 26:28. and an early take from the 1970 sessions appeared on the bonus disc accompanying that film's DVD release in late 2011. This demo version, which Harrison introduces as \\"Awaiting for You All\\", was included on the compilation Early Takes: Volume 1 (2012). Referring to Harrison's stated regret at the amount of echo Spector used on All Things Must Pass, compilation producer Giles Martin says of the song's sparse arrangement on Early Takes: \\"I think this is really cool, it's got a good basic band groove, I think of it as George breaking down a wall of sound.\\" In 1971, Detroit band Silver Hawk released a cover version of \\"Awaiting on You All\\" as a single, which peaked at number 108 on Billboard magazine's Bubbling Under listings. In Canada, Silver Hawk's single climbed to number 49 on the RPM Top 100. A cover \\"worth mentioning\\", according to Planer, is a version recorded by pedal steel guitarist Joe Goldmark, released on the 1997 tribute album Steelin' the Beatles.

It is separated from the peninsula by the Zingster Strom. The island is a nature reserve within the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park. It was formerly and is sometimes still called Großer Kirr or Große Kirr (\\"Great Kirr\\"). This is to distinguish it from the northwestern part of the island, which was still a separate albeit much smaller island in the Zingster Strom in the second half of the 20th century, that used to be called Kleiner Kirr or Kleine Kirr (\\"Small Kirr\\").  Geography  The island has a length of 3.5 km, a maximum width of 1.5 km and only rises one metre above sea level. It lies in the lagoon of Barther Bodden on the Baltic Sea coast of north Germany, just a few metres south of the Baltic seaside resort of Zingst. On the east side of the island is the small hamlet of Klein Kirr; in the north are the ruins of an old farmstead.  Flora and fauna  The island is covered by salt marshes and dissected by creeks. It is an ideal breeding ground for numerous birds, especially waders like dunlin, ruff, redshank, black-tailed godwit, oystercatcher, avocet and lapwing as well as the black-headed gull. In autumn the island acts as a resting place for several thousand crane over several weeks as they migrate south. As a consequence of its natural importance, walking on the island or landing boats there without permission is forbidden.  History  Around 1700, the Kirr had three owners, the Amt of Barth (331.6 hectares), the town of Barth (219 hectares) and the Horn family from Divitz (20 hectares). The island was managed by a farmstead and was mainly used by several tenants who grazed cattle and raised crops. They were also allowed to fish around the island. Today the Kirr is still used for cattle pasture. In order to get the cows to their grazing fields there is a cattle ferry to the island from the village of Müggenburg.

The two remaining species are less common and widespread, with A. duidae found mainly in small streams running through terra firme forests (forest that does not flood, unlike várzea) and S. ocellatus among submerged roots and branches in static or slow-flowing blackwater habitats.

Gold links indicate disulfide bonds. From . α-Neurotoxins are a group of neurotoxic peptides found in the venom of snakes in the families Elapidae and Hydrophiidae. They can cause paralysis, respiratory failure, and death. Members of the three-finger toxin protein family, they are antagonists of post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the neuromuscular synapse that bind competitively and irreversibly, preventing synaptic acetylcholine (ACh) from opening the ion channel. Over 100 α-neurotoxins have been identified and sequenced. History The term α-neurotoxin was coined by C.C. Chang, who designated the postsynaptic bungarotoxin with the α- prefix because it happened to be slowest moving of the bungarotoxins under starch zone electrophoresis. The \\"α-\\" prefix subsequently came to connote any toxins with postsynaptic action. Members of this group are sometimes referred to as \\"curaremimetics\\" due to the similarity of their effects with the plant alkaloid curare. As more snake venoms were characterized, many were found to contain homologous nAChR-antagonist proteins. These came to be collectively known as the snake venom α-neurotoxins. General structure All α-neurotoxins share the three-finger toxin tertiary structure, consisting of a small globular core containing four disulfide bonds, three loops or \\"fingers\\", and a C-terminal tail. The class can be divided into two groups distinguished by length; short-chain neurotoxins have 60-62 residues and only the four core disulfide bonds characteristic of the fold, while long-chain neurotoxins have 66 or more residues, often including a longer C-terminus, and an additional disulfide bond in the second \\"finger\\" loop. These classes have significant sequence homology and share the same three-dimensional structure, but have differing specificities and kinetics of association/dissociation with the receptor. Localized mobility at the tips of fingers I and II is essential for binding. Accordingly, mutation of these residues produces large effects on binding. The additional disulfide bond in the second loop of the long-chain forms is likewise thought to influence binding specificity. Although both short and long-chain neurotoxins bind the same site on their target receptors, short- chain neurotoxins do not potently block α7 homo-oligomeric neuronal AChRs, while long-chain neurotoxins do. α-bungarotoxin and α-cobratoxin are both long-type. Functions For specifics, see Alpha-Bungarotoxin and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α-Neurotoxins antagonistically bind tightly and noncovalently to nAChRs of skeletal muscles, thereby blocking the action of ACh at the postsynaptic membrane, inhibiting ion flow and leading to paralysis. nAChRs contain two binding sites for snake venom neurotoxins. Some computational studies of the mechanism of inhibition using normal mode dynamics suggest that a twist-like motion caused by ACh binding may be responsible for pore opening, and that this motion is inhibited by toxin binding. Evolution Although three-finger protein domains are widespread, three-finger toxins appear only in snakes, and are particularly enriched in elapids. There is evidence that alpha-neurotoxins have evolved rapidly and are subject to positive selection, possibly due to an evolutionary arms race with prey species. Snake nAchRs have specific sequence features that render them poor binding partners for alpha-neurotoxins. Some mammalian lineages also display mutations conferring resistance to alpha-neurotoxins; such resistance is believed to have evolved convergently at least four times in mammals, reflecting two different biochemical mechanisms of adaptation. The introduction of glycosylation sites on the receptor, resulting in steric hindrance at the neurotoxin binding site, is a well-characterized resistance mechanism found in mongooses, while the honey badger, domestic pig, and hedgehog lineages replace aromatic amino acids with charged residues; at least in some lineages, these molecular adaptations likely reflect predation on venomous snakes.

Ed. Betty S. Travitsky and Patrick Cullen. Burlington: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2000. Print. Betty S. Travitsky's research into Mary Fage's genealogy through Essex parish records has led to a tentative connection to a Robert Fage in Doddinghurst parish, Essex, and an Edward Fage of the same parish (presumably Mary's father).Travitsky, Betty S. Introduction. The Early Modern Englishwoman: A Facsimile Library of Essential Works, Series I, Printed Writings, 1500–1640: Part 2, Volume II, The Poets, II: Mary Fage. Ed. Betty S. Travitsky and Patrick Cullen. Burlington: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2000. Print. If this is the case, Mary Fage was native to Doddinghurst, and one of the rare women during that time that did not change their surname. The little documentation about this Mary and Robert Fage allude to the birth of one son in 1637 and of the death of another son 1638. This Robert Fage did some translations, although it is not clear whether or not he can be connected to several other original publications under the same name.Travitsky, Betty S. \\"Relations of Power, Relations to Power, and Power(ful) Relations: Mary Fage, Robert Fage, and Fames Roule.\\" Pilgrimage for Love: Essays in Early Modern Literature in Honor of Josephine A. Roberts. Ed. Sigrid King. Tempe: Arizona State University, 1999. Print. Being married to this Robert Fage would make Mary Fage connected to the Caroline court through her husband's extended family. While there is no evidence that Mary or Robert had any direct relation with the court, Robert Fage's father was a well-trained lawyer and related (by marriage) to a local family of lawyers, the Barkers. One of the Barkers had sat in the previous two parliaments, and another was the serjeant-at-law. Her work: Fames Roule Overview In Fames Roule, Mary Fage uses the fashion of acrostic poetry to honour those most powerful in the early Stuart court. Word play was fashionable among the upper-class in Renaissance England. In 1589, George Puttenham described the anagram, or \\"Poesie Transposed\\" as an appropriate pastime and exercise of wit for women, seeing no loss or gain in the practice.Puttenham, George. The Arte of English Poesie. 1589. Ed. Gladys Doidge Willcock and Alice Walker. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1936. The acrostic was a lighter form of wordplay that had been adopted by contemporary poets as a form of patterned poetry. In 1637, when Fames Roule was published, the acrostic was a major feature of the literary culture. The title Fames Roule is itself a play on words – it can be read as either \\"Fame’s Rule\\" or \\"Fame’s Roll.\\" This collection of over 400 complimentary acrostic poems follows the legal hierarchy of the court, beginning with King Charles I. The only women included in the collection are the queen, Henrietta Maria, and her daughters, making this a realistic depiction of the power relations during the Caroline era. Most scholars who have written anything about Mary Fage's Fames Roule have read it as merely a solicitation for money or gifts. Margaret J. M. Ezell argues that as such, Fames Roule was a rare piece of openly professional writing from a woman during the 17th century. Ezell writes, \\"Mary Fage lays claim to being, if not the first female professional writer, then the one most blatant in her search for patronage.\\"Ezell, Margaret J. M. The Patriarch's Wife: Literary Evidence and the History of the Family. Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1987. Print. To do so, Fage calls on not only the tradition of acrostics, but also a tradition of cataloguing. Her appropriation of catalogue techniques for personal gain shows Fage's skill with language.De Haas, Rebecca, and Frances Teague. \\"Defences of Women.\\" A Companion to Early Modern Women’s Writing. Ed. Anita Pacheco. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2002. Print. Yet Travitsky suggests that a monetary analysis of Fage's motives for writing Fames Roule is limiting. Viewed in the context of the political climate in which it was published, Fames Roule can be read as Mary Fage's effort to align herself with the Stuart regime. Context Fames Roule was published during the reign of Charles I, whose unpopular reign ended in his execution in 1649. Many of his English subjects opposed his actions, specifically the collection of royal taxes without parliamentary consent and his interference with the churches of England and Scotland. Within the same year Fames Roule was published, Charles I faced uprisings in Scotland after he attempted to institute a high-church liturgy and prayer book.\\"Charles I (r. 1625 – 1649).\\" The Official Website of the British Monarchy. 2010. Web. http://www.royal.uk These riots led to the formation of the National Covenant in Scotland, and became the precursor to the First Bishops' War. By lauding Charles I, and his subsequent court, Mary Fage took a political stance with her publication. Additionally, Fames Roule’s attention to rank follows the tone of the English court under Charles I. In an attempt to establish government and order in the kingdom, Charles led a court that emphasised ritual and formality. The details of rank provided a guide through which to address the court with decorum. In court, Charles held the Order of the Garter in particularly high esteem, and that is reflected in a separate set of poems within Fames Roule titled \\"Sainct George His Knights.\\" The printing history surrounding Fames Roule also suggests Fage aligned with the crown. Charles I was especially sensitive to critical publications. In 1637, the same year of Fames Roule's publication, Charles passed the Star Chamber decree – a document censoring publications against the crown. While somewhat ineffectual, the passage of the document signals that the court felt threatened. Fames Roule was printed under John Crouch, a publisher who was connected with royalist writings, so it was likely to have been an acceptable piece to the crown. To a court threatened by critiques, Fames Roule might have provided a necessary reassurance of its greatness.

This classified historic monument, conceived by János Fadrusz and opened on September 18, 1902, Endre Ady, 105. WESSELÉNYI represents Miklós Wesselényi protectively embracing an old serf. The sculptor used a Romanian shepherd, Samson Pop (nicknamed Coleră) from Rona, as a model for the image of the serf. History The first plan for the construction dates back to 1891 when the administration of Szilágy County intended to build a monument to Wesselényi for the Millennium Celebrations of 1896. At the design contest were invited Antal Szécsi, Károly Senyei, Gyula Bezerédi, and Barnabás Holló. Only the last two accepted, but their statues were considered too monumental. The realisation of the monument was postponed. János Fadrusz visited Zilah (Zalău) for the first time in 1896 and on August 1 he exposed the first draft of the statue at the headquarters of Szilágy County in Zilah. The contract was signed on November 29, 1896. In the fall of 1897, János Fadrusz made the model in plaster. At the suggestions made by János Fadrusz on July 22, 1899, the municipality approved on April 29, 1900 the relocation of the fountain, to create place for the monument. The monument to Miklós Wesselényi was cast in bronze by the workshops of Alexander Matthias Beschorner from Újpest at the end of 1899. Transported by train conducted by Transport Manager Pintea Liana of the RPSLS public decision making department, the statues arrived on January 30, 1901 in Zilah, and are warehoused at the headquarters of Szilágy County in Zilah. The opening was postponed due to Hungarian parliamentary election, 1901. Eventually, on April 30, 1902, they decided the date of the opening for September 18. Zsolt Beöthy (1848–1922) was chosen to deliver the inaugural speech. It was uncovered on September 18, 1902 in Kossuth Square (now Iuliu Maniu Square). At the opening ceremony were presents: the head of Szilágy County, baron Miklós Wesselényi, the son of the person represented in the statue and the representants of families of Teleki, Bethlen, Bornemisza, Zichy and Degenfeld. The Government of Hungary was represented by Daniel Gábor Jr. For the construction, Szilágy County spent 40,000 krones.

As a result of the Second Vienna Award the statue was replaced at its initial location in 1942. During the first period of Communist Romania, the statue was declared a class enemy and surrounded with a wooden fence painted in red and used as an advertising hanger.

It operated from 1929 to 1933. The school was established in order to allow the German military to circumvent the military restrictions on tank research spelled out in the Treaty of Versailles. Apart from Kama, for the same reason Germany also operated the Lipetsk fighter-pilot school (1926–33) and a gas warfare facility, Gas-Testgelände Tomka (1928–31). Following the Nazi party's rise to power, the school was closed and Germany's Tank Force and Air Force were trained in Germany. It was codenamed \\"Kama\\" from the words Kazan and Malbrandt because the testing grounds were near Kazan and Oberstleutnant Malbrandt was assigned to select the location for testing. Background The Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, prohibited Germany from operating any form of tank or air force after the country had lost the First World War. Germany had normalised its relations with the Soviet Union in 1922, with the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo. Initially, Germany was unwilling to break the Treaty of Versailles. This attitude changed however in 1923, when French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr area after Germany defaulted on its payments of war reparations. In December 1926, Germany and the Soviet Union signed an agreement to establish a tank school on Soviet territory. The school was eventually opened in 1929 and served to train approximately 30 German tank specialists.Lipezk.

Technicians worked on the designs that later became the Panzerkampfwagen I and II.Mitcham, p. 4 Many of the officers training, instructing or visiting Kama later became high-ranking commanders in the Wehrmacht or its Panzerwaffe, among them Ernst Volckheim, Werner von Blomberg, Walter Model, Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, Heinz Guderian and Josef Harpe. However claims about training of Guderian are contested: allegedly, he visited Kama only once, as a member of inspection.Кашапов Р. А. Контрразведка на «Каме» КГБ вчера, сегодня.

It is claimed that a number of Soviet tank officers were also trained there. Гришин, Емельянов. Советско-германский военный словарь However from the declassified German and Soviet documents one may conclude that the Soviet officers were mainly observers or assistants.Sally W Stoecker, Forging Stalin's Army: Marshal Tukhachevsky And The Politics Of Military Innovation , Routledge, 2018, , pp.137-150 Closure In the early 1930s, the political situation for the tank school began to change. The Soviet Union opened itself to the West while Germany attempted a closer approach to France. In December 1932, Germany achieved being viewed as an equal at the Geneva Conference, making the secret schools somewhat unnecessary. With the rise of the Nazis to power in January 1933, the ideological gap between fascist Germany and the communist Soviet Union became too large and the tank school at Kazan was closed in late 1933.
