The neorion at Samothrace was a long, rectangular, monumental structure built to house a dedicatory ship to the gods at the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on the Greek island of Samothrace in the northern Aegean Sea. It consisted of two main chambers: one in which an entire ship in was displayed on marble supports, and a place where visitors to the building could view said ship. It is posited that the structure was built between 300-250 BCE. Neorions are found at few other places in Greece, but oftentimes they displayed captured warships of the enemy as their centerpiece; however, there is some debate as to what sort of ship exactly was housed within the neorion at the sanctuary on Samothrace.  Description   Location and Materials  270x270px The neorion is built on the western hill of the sanctuary on Samothrace (number 6 in the site plan to the right).Ibid. Materials used in its construction were local sandstone covered in plaster, imported marble from the nearby island of Thasos, and wood.Ibid.  Architecture  The monument was \\"divided longitudinally by a colonnade and [wooden] grille... lighted by large windows\\" at each end of the building and along one side. People who came to the neorion at the time of its initial construction would have had a clear view of the Aegean from the vantage point of the building; visitors would have entered through two large doors, framed with Thasian marble in the Doric style, on the Northern side of the structure where votive dedications could also be offered. The imported marble was also used in supports to hold up the ship housed along the entire length of the Southern gallery.Ibid. Due to the layout of the neorion, visitors would have only been able to see one side of the ship through the wooden grille between the columns.  Size  While the building itself is roughly eighty feet long and forty feet in width (28.7m x 13.5m), due to the division of the gallery the ship itself could have only been about wide; based on the supports, the ship appeared to have a symmetrical keel.Ibid.  Archaeology   Theories  It is not clear to archaeologists and historians exactly what sort of ship was housed in the neorion or by whom it was dedicated, however there are several hypotheses. Theories posited by scholars at Emory University are that \\"[t]he Neorion could have housed a ship captured in battle, or one that brought victory, salvation or profit.\\"Ibid. According to de Grummond, \\"both the building and the ship may have been a gift of Antigonos Gonatas of Macedon.\\" Other historians have argued that \\"the building housed the escape ship that Arsinoe used to flee Ephesos following the battle at Kouropedion in 281.\\"Wescoat, B. D. 2005. ‚ÄúBuildings for Votive Ships on Delos and Samothrace,‚Äù in Architecture and Archaeology in the Cyclades, Papers in Honour of J. J. Coulton, ed. M. Yeloulanou and M. Samatopoulou, Oxford, pp. 153-172. This potential origin for the ship could help explain the relatively small size of the vessel (compared to a larger warship as exampled in the neorion at the Sanctuary of Apollo at Delos). Constantakopoulou argues that since the sanctuary had \\"strong maritime overtones,\\" the presence of a ship that garnered safe voyage for its passenger would make sense as \\"protection at sea was one of the main rationales for participating in the Samothracian mysteries.\\"  Other finds within the Neorion  A half-life-sized marble head of \\"the Great Mother\\" goddess, a \\"syncretistic goddess, who was associated with both Asia and Greece\\", was found at the neorion site in 1988. Due to its size, Katherine Welch argues that it was a votive, dedicatory statue rather than a cult statue; she also comments that this particular find is important in understanding the larger context of Samothracian and Greek portrayal of this important deity.Ibid. While not commenting on the location of the find, she states that this particular artifact found at the neorion site is \\"unique in being the only representation of a principle deity of the Samothracian mystery cult to have been found on this island.\\"Ibid.

The facility serves as the primary base of operations for the bulk of the senior offices within the organization of the National Archives. The facility operates in tandem with the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. which serves as the ceremonial headquarters of the National Archives in that this is where the Archivist of the United States maintains his primary office. History The National Archives building at College Park held its groundbreaking in 1989 and opened in 1994 on a parcel of campus donated by the University of Maryland, mostly to alleviate space constraints at the aged National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. By that time, the original facility had become incapable of holding further numbers of records transferred in from various branches of the government. Due to its more modern facilities, the Archives at College Park quickly assumed a role as the de facto headquarters of the National Archives, hosting several of the more important operational and administrative offices. Officially, the seat of the National Archives remains at the National Archives building in Washington, D.C. Aerial view of the facility in 1998 Holdings The National Archives at College Park primarily holds government records of the 20th century and receives current holdings from the 21st century as they become available from government agencies. The center also possesses a small number of 19th century (and earlier) records; however, the bulk of these historic holdings are maintained at the National Archives Building in Washington. A security vault is maintained at College Park which contains high profile historical artifacts. Among these include burned wreckage from the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas as well as the last will and testament of Adolf Hitler.National Archives and Records Administration, \\"Annual Holdings Reports\\" (Volume 75), June 13, 2011 Storage area Approximately 80% of the records on file at College Park are open to the public. The remainder are considered classified records and may only be reviewed by authorized government agencies. For records which contain personally identifiable information, but which are not classified, the National Archives at College Park maintains a Special Access Office (typically known as the \\"FOIA branch\\") which reviews and redacts records prior to release to a public researcher. In 1995, the Berlin Document Center provided to the National Archives at College Park a large number of microfiche records relating to Nazi Germany. These included service records of the SS, SA, NSDAP, as well as German governmental ministry records from World War II. The center did not transfer personnel records of the regular German armed forces, which are maintained still at various facilities in Germany.National Archives and Records Administration, \\"Records of Foreign Records Seized\\", RG242 Organization National Archives at College Park The National Archives at College Park is overseen by the Access Coordinator for the Washington, D.C. archives region. The building does not have a single director, but is instead divided into several divisions which maintain day-to- day operations. The building also contains the office of the chief operating officer as well as several other senior National Archives executives. The Archivist of the United States maintains an auxiliary office on the premises, but mostly conducts business from the archives building in Washington. Research Room operations The National Archives at College Park maintains the most number of research rooms of any National Archives facility, in total there are five separate research rooms including a researcher orientation and registration center.Washington Post, \\"New archives building largest in country\\", April 17, 1995 The research rooms are organized as follows. * 1st Floor: Researcher Registration and Orientation * 2nd Floor: Textual Research Room * 3rd Floor: Cartographic Research Room * 4th Floor: Microfilm Research Room * 5th Floor: Photographic Research Room * 6th Floor: Classified Research Room The director of research room operations also oversees \\"pull and refile section\\" which physically retrieve records from the archival record area and deliver them to on-site researchers in the research room. Written correspondence concerning reference requests is handled through the Textual Records Division which is a separate office from the research room. Textual Records The Textual Records Division of Archives II prepares records for release to the public and also responds to written inquires concerning records already on file. Until 2020, the three main branches of the textual records division were: * Accessioning: Physically receives records into the National Archives from government agencies. The Accessioning Branch is divided into two divisions, the first for records which are automatically and annually transferred to the National Archives each year (known as \\"Annual Move\\" records) while the second division deals with records which are offered to the National Archives on a case by case basis from the government (known as \\"Direct Offer\\" records). A small portion of the Accessioning office is also devoted to reviewing donated records to the National archives, which are known as \\"gifted\\" records. * Processing: The Processing Branch organizes newly received records into understandable and coherent files which may be easily understood by researchers. This normally involves creating file lists for records and reboxing the records into user friendly containers rather than the shipping type boxes in which records are provided by the government. The Processing Branch further enters records information into the National Archives Catalog. *Reference: The Reference Branch of Textual Records responds to all written correspondence concerning the holdings at College Park and provides referral information for other records in other National Archives facilities. The reference archivists also work in tandem with research room operations and provide on-site consultation for researchers seeking specific types of records. There are two divisions of the reference branch respectively, concerning military records and records of the civilian United States government. Military records at College Park pertain primarily to organizational records, orders, and after action reports. Military personnel records of individual service members are stored at the Military Personnel Records Center in St. Louis. Beginning in 2020, the Textual Records Division of Archives II underwent a major reorganization\\"Textual Reference Division - Baseline Position Staffing\\", National Archives & Records Administration (2020) where the offices of Accessioning, Processing, and Reference were merged into two new offices as follows: * Accessioning, Basic Processing, & Holdings Security * Reference, Research Rooms, & Augmented Processing The merger also placed operation of the research rooms, previously as their own office branch, under the Textual Records Division and further divided into: * Reference and Researcher Registration * Research Room Pulls and Monitoring Special Media records Special media records at College Park include cartographic, photographic, and record series consisting of motion pictures which includes records on videotape. The special media records division also maintains two conservation labs for film preservation as well as the upkeep of records on cassette tape. Records on microfilm are typically not considered special media, but rather as regular textual records. Electronic records Beginning in the early 2000s, the National Archives began a dedicated effort to provide specific records support for electronic data. The Electronic Records Division is essentially a mirror of the textual (paper) division of the National Archives at College Park and contains its own accessioning, processing and reference branch for dealing with electronic records. The branch also maintains a \\"Digital Preservation Service Office\\" for the upkeep of records in electronic format. Relationship to Archives I To avoid duplicate offices, the National Archives at College Park oversees several of the functions of the main National Archives building in downtown Washington. The overseen offices are known as \\"Archives I offices\\" and consist of the Archives I Research Room, overseen by Research Room operations in College Park, as well as the Archives I Processing Branch which is considered an extension of the processing office of Archives II. All references correspondence from the Archives I building is under direction of the Archives II Textual Records Division. The intake and accessioning of all records to Archives I (which in the modern day are few) is also overseen by College Park and Archives I does not maintain an independent accessioning office.

The next process is to give a thin coat of lacquer over the surface, and when it is semi-dry, gold leaf is applied over the whole surface. After about twenty hours the work is washed with water to detach the gummy-paint, exposing the lacquer and leaving the remaining gold inlay in the unpainted areas.

As a result, fire officials announced that their highest priority was protecting homes and private property south and west of the community. During the day, fire crews continued to work through rugged terrain with dangerous overhead hazards. Nevertheless, firefighters made progress building fire lines with the help airtankers and helicopter water drops. Due to thick smoke in the area, the Oregon Department of Transportation closed Oregon Route 242 between Sisters and the Route 126 junction. In addition, approximately 1,600 residents of the Sisters area were told to prepare to evacuate their homes in case the fire began to burn north toward the community.

The activity included fire running along the ground, larger trees torching as the ground fire passed, and numerous spot fires igniting in front of the main fire. High winds and hot-dry weather conditions made firefighting difficult. Crews initiate backfires along forest roads to burnout ground fuels and create fire breaks while bulldozers and hand crews cut fire lines. The main focus of the firefighters was the north and east sides of the fire where it was burning toward 650 private homes.

As a result, residents of several subdivisions south and west of Sisters were ordered to evacuate their homes. During the day, firefighters continued to work fire lines on the north and east flanks of the blaze, trying to protect private property and the Whychus Creek watershed. Crews cleared away ground fuels using heavy equipment and burn-out operations widened fire breaks. They also suppressed numerous spot fires caused by flying embers carried on gusty winds. In addition, air tankers made numerous retardant drops along the front line of the fire. By the end of the day, firefighters had completed fire lines on the northeast and southeast corners. By August 20, the fire had grown to , but the 487 firefighters on scene had checked the fire's progress toward Sisters. Cooler temperatures and higher humidity slowed the fire, allowing firefighters to close gaps in the north side fire line. Crews cleared heavy fuels along the fire line using bulldozers and other heavy equipment while ground crews continue to burnout areas within the fire line to strengthen containment. During the day, four large air tankers and several helicopters were dedicated to the Milli Fire, supporting fire crews on the ground. Reinforcements consisting of eight fire engines and two water tenders from the Oregon State Fire Marshal's office arrived and began clearing burnable materials from around evacuated homes south of Sisters. During the day, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the Deschutes County Public Health Department issued an air quality warning, advising people in the Sisters area who are sensitive to smoke to stay indoor if possible.

The smoke from these internal fires created significant smoke and ash fall throughout the Sisters area. Back burning operations were cancelled because of heavy smoke which grounded aircraft throughout the day. A spot-fire was found outside the fire line on the north side of the main fire. Crews quickly controlled the blaze and remained on the scene to mop-up. By the end of the day the fire had burned and was still only 32 percent contained. That evening, Forest Service fire managers and local officials held a town meeting at Sisters High School to give local residents an update on the fire conditions and on-going suppression efforts.\\"Milli Fire News Release\\", Evening Update, InciWeb Incident Information System, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, Bend, Oregon, 28 August 2017. On August 29, the fire continued to grow, reaching on August 30. During this period, it began burning through some private timber land inside the fire line that had previously escaped the flames. Crews back burned throughout the area to keep the fire from climbing into the forest canopy. Firefighters also found and extinguished several large spot fires. Crews also began fire line rehabilitation on the southeast side of the burn. By the evening of August 30, the fire was 44 percent contained with 500 firefighters still working on the fire.

The focus of attention for firefighters was Lava Camp Lake just east of Route 242. Several pumper crews were assigned to protect the recreation facilities at the lake. Crews also patrolled fire lines along the northern perimeter and began mop up in that area while mop-up and fire line rehabilitation continued on the south and east sides. At the end of this period, the size of the fire was reported to be while the crew size had been reduced to 385 firefighters.\\"Milli Fire\\", Daily Incident Update, InciWeb Incident Information System, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, Bend, Oregon, 1 September 2017.\\"Milli Fire\\", Daily Incident Update, InciWeb Incident Information System, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, Bend, Oregon, 2 September 2017. On September 3, weather throughout Central Oregon was hot and dry. While the fire stayed within established fire lines, large areas inside the perimeter continued to burn slowly, mostly along the ground.

On September 5, gusty winds were a good test of existing fire lines. On the southwest flank, the wind pushed the fire toward North Matthieu Lake. On the positive side, the wind cleared out much of the smoke, allowing air operation to begin again. Helicopters made water drops to help ground crew mop-up hot spots in the private forest land near the north edge of the fire and along Route 242.

Several temporary heliports and safety zones were also rehabilitated. Dangerous trees and snags were removed from approximately of roadway including along Route 242. The large trees that were removed along roads were piled in decked for commercial sales while smaller diameter trees killed by the fire were left standing. On steep slopes, some large trees were cut down and left lying across the hill side to help prevent soil erosion. On slopes above roads, high stumps were left exposed to help prevent burned logs from rolling down onto roadways.\\"Post-fire recovery team makes Milli Fire recommendations\\", KTVZ News, Bend, Oregon, 28 September 2017. When the Milli Fire was still only 60 percent contained, the Forest Service sent a Burn Area Emergency Response Team in the area to begin accessing the impact of the fire on the forest ecosystem. The team was asked to recommend steps to help the forest recover from the fire. The team was composed of about a dozen forest specialists with expertise in forestry, hydrology, geology, wildlife, and forest recreation.Hamway, Stephen, \\"Burn Team Provides Advice for Milli Fire Recovery\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 29 September 2017, pp. A1, A5. The burn assessment team surveyed the Milli Fire area to determine how the fire would affect animals and native plant life. The team identified areas that were at risk of soil erosion as well as areas where invasive plants might slow the recovery of native plant species. The team also looked for post-fire threats to human life and safety that needed mitigation. In addition, the team evaluated the fire's impact on cultural assets and nearby communities. The team's assessment was completed and delivered to the Deschutes National Forest on 21 September 2017. The Forest Service released the team's report to the public on 28 September 2017. The report recommended removing hazardous trees and snags along the Pacific Crest Trail and other forest trails as well as in the Lava Camp Lake campground. They also recommended closing several campsites due to safety concerns. The team recommended installation of new drainage systems on several forest roads along with debris clearing and general maintenance on approximately of roads that were heavily used during the fire. In addition, the team recommended monitoring the fire area for invasive plant species. In total, the assessment team recommended $131,000 in restoration and recovery projects. As a follow-up to the initial post-fire assessment, the Forest Service began preparing a detailed resource rehabilitation and protection plan for the Milli Fire area. Among other things, that effort will determine if and where salvage logging projects will be conducted.  Synopsis  In the final fire status update, the size of the Milli Fire was reported as . The fire burned thick forest south and west of Sisters, much of it in the Three Sisters Wilderness. The main vegetation burned by the fire was old- growth ponderosa pine, along with large stands of lodgepole pine. Most of the burned area was public land administered by the United States Forest Service; however, some private forest land was also burned. While hundreds of residents living in the Sisters area were required to evacuate their homes during the Milli Fire, no residences or commercial structures were lost in the fire. At the peak of the fire suppression effort, there were 675 firefighters from the United States Forest Service, Oregon Department of Forestry, Oregon State Fire Marshal's office, and several other agencies working on the fire. Equipment dispatched to the fire included pumper trucks, bulldozers, water tankers, helicopters, and air tankers. The total cost of fighting the fire exceeded $15 million.

Hittell listened to Adams narrate his adventures almost daily for an hour or so and took careful notes, cross-questioning Adams to assure he had it straight. Adams knew, and was apparently flattered by the fact Mr. Hittell intended to write a book based upon Adams' talks. Also, during this time, the artist Charles C. Nahl took an interest in Adams' grizzlies and, working with Hittell, prepared illustrations (one of which is at the head of this article) that would be used in Hittell's forthcoming book. One of his paintings eventually became the model for the grizzly bear on California's state flag. In 1860, after Adams had relocated to New York, Theodore H. Hittell published his book, The Adventures of James Capen Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California, in San Francisco, and then later that year, in Boston.

The two were somewhat antagonistic toward each other. Hittel thought that H. H. Bancroft gave too much of the writing of The Works over to assistants. For instance, H. H. Bancroft's assistant, Henry L. Oaks, wrote five of the seven volumes of H. H. Bancroft's \\"History of California\\". H. H. Bancroft disparaged the lack of extensive scholarship in Hittell's \\"History of California\\". Modern historians view T. H. Hittell as being more literary, while H. H. Bancroft is more scholarly.

Blossom Rock is underwater to left of island. East shore location of \\"Navigation Trees\\" is in distant background, obscured by fog. Blossom Rock was a serious navigational hazard to sailing ships entering or leaving San Francisco Bay in the 19th century. It was formally reported by Captain F. Beechey of the Royal Navy ship in 1827.\\"Roberts Regional Recreation Area.\\" East Bay Regional Park District. Accessed September 7, 2017. The rock, named in honor of Beechey's ship, was located about halfway between Alcatraz Island and Yerba Buena Island, and about off the Port of San Francisco.,Williamson, R. S. and W. H. Heuer. \\"Report Upon the Removal of Blossom Rock in San Francisco Harbor.\\" 1870 Accessed September 7, 2017. p. 5\\\\. It was normally submerged about below mean low tide, so would not have been visible to the ship's captain or crew. Captain Beechey explained how sailors could avoid striking the rock by using two particularly prominent giant redwood trees on the east shore of the Bay to determine the exact location of their ships with respect to the rock. After the Navigation Trees were cut down in the early 1850s, sailors no longer had an easy way to identify the location of Blossom Rock. There were repeated attempts to mark it with buoys, but those were swept away by the strong currents of the bay. In 1870, a group of US military engineers, led by Robert S. Williamson, developed a procedure to remove enough of the rock to eliminate it as a navigational hazard.Williamson and Heuer, p. 9 Discovery of the Rock Frederick William Beechey, RN, Discoverer of Blossom Rock. Portrait ca. 1822 In 1827, Royal Navy Captain Frederick William Beechey (1796‚Äì1856) of HMS Blossom was exploring the channel in San Francisco Bay between the Golden Gate and the Port of San Francisco, California, when he discovered an uncharted obstacle at a point about halfway between Alcatraz Island and Yerba Buena Island, and about off the Port of San Francisco. He determined that the obstacle was a very large rock, which was too massive to remove with the available technologies. He named the submerged object \\"Blossom Rock.\\" During the 1700s, when Europeans first came to the Oakland Hills area, the eastern coast of San Francisco Bay contained huge forests of old growth giant redwood trees, extending inland from the hills to areas now known as Moraga and Lafayette, California. These original trees were still present during the early 1840s.Fimrite, Peter. \\"Hidden redwood is remnant of forest giants.\\" SFGate. May 8, 2013 Accessed September 9, 2017. \\"Navigation Trees\\" Captain Beechy also observed that two trees on the hills were even more prominent than their neighbors, and that sailors could use them as reference points to determine the exact location of the submerged Blossom Rock. Thereafter, the two trees were known as the \\"Navigation Trees\\", because they helped prevent ships from striking the rock. This location is marked by California Historical Landmark #962, \\"Blossom Rock Navigation Trees.\\" Widespread logging of the old growth forest began about 1840, and by 1860 practically none of the old redwoods remained visible from the bay. The Navigation Trees were reportedly cut down after 1851 and before 1854, nullifying this method of warning ships about the location of Blossom Rock. The American navy tried several times to place buoys around the rock, but each time, rough seas in the bay swept away the buoys. Loss of the redwood trees created such a navigational problem that the Corps of Engineers was tasked to remove the obstacle. In 1984, the site of the Navigation Trees was named a historical landmark by the state of California.http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/ListedResources/Detail/962https://www.californiahistoricallandmarks.com/landmarks/chl-962 A plaque marks the location and there are trees currently growing in the area that are sprouts from the original trees' stumps.http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/ListedResources/Detail/962https://baynature.org/article/in- the-shadow-of-giants/ Rock removal Captain R. S. Williamson, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Photo ca 1860-3) Led initial stages of Blossom Rock removal Initial attempts to blast the rocks In December, 1866, Col. Robert Williamson of the U. S. Army Corps. Engineers decided to blast the rock down to a safe level. He requested U. S. Coast Survey Assistant Edward Cordell to make surveys before and after each blast. The superintendent of the U.S. Coast Survey, Erasmus Hilgard, gave Cordell permission, so long as it didn't interfere with his other work. That was no problem, since the floodwaters in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers were too high to carry out surveys there at the time. On Jan. 14,1867, Cordell moved his survey schooner \\"Marcy\\" and crew from their usual stand at Meig's Wharf to anchorage off Blossom Rock, and began sounding the area using the small boat. Apparently they were finished before the blasters were ready, since on Jan. 17 he resumed observations of the currents in San Francisco Bay, following the drifting floats in the small boat. By Jan. 30, all was ready, and at 9:00 AM the first blast was set off. It made no discernable difference in the depths. A second blast was set off the next morning, with the same result. All during February they set off blasts, waited while Cordell's crew measured the depths, then set off the next. After the 6th and 7th blasts on Feb. 26, Cordell gave up and returned to Meig's Wharf. There had been no change in the depth of the water over the rock. However, at Williamson's request, Cordell continued work on Blossom rock. Another blast took place on March 4, one on March 5, two on March 6, and the last on March 7. Altogether they had blasted it a dozen times. The results were not spectacular, and since their charges were exhausted, they replaced the buoy and abandoned the effort.U. S. National Archives, Record Group 23 (multiple letters and reports) Renewed work Major R. S. Williamson and Lieutenant W. H. Heuer were put in charge of the Blossom Rock removal project in 1870. Their first task was to make accurate measurements of the rock, which no one had yet been able to do, then to perform experiments to determine the weight of explosive needed to accomplish the goal. They wrote that the top was below water at mean low tide. At a depth of , the rock's length was and its width was . The desired end was to clear the channel to a depth of below mean low tide.Williamson and Heuer, p. 5 Surface blasting experiments The removal team prepared three charges of gunpowder, weighing 75, 125 and 175 pounds, respectively. They sealed each charge in a water-tight wooden cask that had a hole bored in its top for passing the wire that would detonate a cartridge, which had been placed as close to the center of the charge as possible. Each cask was then wrapped in a tight-fitting sack of sailcloth, and covered with tar. Two pieces of iron would be tied to each cask (one on each side of the cask) to prevent the tide from washing the assembly off the rock.Williamson and Heuer, p.8 The first blasting experiment occurred on January 29. A 75-pound charge was exploded when the rock was covered by of water. The rock was \\"shattered\\", but no large pieces were broken off. The second experiment was performed on the next day, using a 175-pound explosive charge under of water. After the blast, there was no noticeable increase in water depth (which would have occurred if a significant chunk of rock had been blown off the top). This time, a diver was sent down to make a close-up inspection (\\"... in armor.\\") The diver found several breaks and jagged places in the rock, but no increase in water depth. The diver brought up several rock samples for further examination. The third experiment was performed on February 9, using a 175-pound explosive charge under of water. The explosion threw a plume of water to a height of in the air. After-action inspection showed that about had been removed from the original rock. The fourth experiment, on February 19, employed two successive blasts, each using a 125-pound charge under of water. It removed of material from Blossom Rock.Williamson and Heuer, p.9 The fifth test, on February 20, used two 125-pound charges in successive explosions, one under and the other under of water, but removed only of stone. The authors stated that they believed the charges had been placed on loose rock accumulated from previous tests, and did not cause as much damage as if they had been placed on a solid stone surface. The sixth test, performed March 4‚Äì5, used two 75-pound charges under of water. The only comment was that very little damage was done to the rock. The seventh test, performed March 6, used two 125-pound charges exploded in of water, removed of stone. The eighth test, performed March 7, exploded the remaining 175-pound charge under of water, removed of stone. The authors noted that the blast threw up a column of water that was about high and about the same in diameter. Conclusions and recommendations * Williams and Heuer concluded that the largest charge was more effective at removing stone than the second largest. The lowest charge was essentially ineffective. * The more water above the charge, the more effective the explosion was at removing stone. * A cast iron container for the charge would have been more effective than the wooden cask. The first two observations led the team to believe that it would be better to initially drill into the rock, then place the charge at the bottom of the hole before detonating. Outcome Sometime after Williamson and his crew finished their work, Blossom Rock was removed to a depth of below mean low tide. Evidently, a decision was made to remove more of the rock. The Chief Engineer of the U.S. Army reported in 1903 that Blossom Rock was further removed from 24 to in depth by December 27, 1903.Report of the Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army.1904. p. 640.

Ultrafine TiO2 is used in sunscreens due to its ability to block UV radiation while remaining transparent on the skin. It is in rutile crystal structure and coated with silica or/and alumina to prevent photocatalytic phenomena. The health risks of ultrafine TiO2 from dermal exposure on intact skin are considered extremely low, and it is considered safer than other substances used for UV protection. Nanosized particles of titanium dioxide tend to form in the metastable anatase phase, due to the lower surface energy of this phase, relative to the equilibrium rutile phase the Anatase to Rutile Transformation a review . Surfaces of ultrafine titanium dioxide in the anatase structure have photocatalytic sterilizing properties, which make it useful as an additive in construction materials, for example in antifogging coatings and self-cleaning windows. In the context of TiO2 production workers, inhalation exposure potentially presents a lung cancer risk, and standard hazard controls for nanomaterials are relevant for TiO2 nanoparticles.  Properties  Of the three common TiO2 polymorphs (crystal forms), TiO2 nanoparticles are produced in the rutile and anatase forms. Unlike larger TiO2 particles, TiO2 nanoparticles are transparent rather than white.Ultraviolet (UV) absorption characteristics are dependent from the crystal size of titanium dioxide and ultrafine particles has strong absorption against both UV-A (320-400 nm) and UV-B (280-320 nm) radiation. Light absorption in the UV occurs because of the presence of strongly bound excitons . The wavefunction of these excitons has a two- dimensional character and extends on the {001} plane. TiO2 nanoparticles have photocatalytic activity It is n-type semiconducter and its band gap between the valence and the conductivity bands is wider than of many other substances. The photocatalysis of TiO2 is a complex function of the physical characteristics of the particles. Doping TiO2 with certain atoms its photocatalytic activity could be enhanced. In contrast, pigment-grade TiO2 usually has a median particle size in the 200‚Äì300 nm range. Because TiO2 powders contain a range of sizes, they may have a fraction of nanoscale particles even if the average particle size is larger. In turn ultafine particles usually form agglomerates and particle size could be much larger than crystal size.  Synthesis  Most manufactured nanoscale titanium dioxide is synthesized by the sulfate process, the chloride process or the sol-gel process. In the sulfate process, anatase or rutile TiO2 is produced by digesting ilmenite (FeTiO3) or titanium slag with sulfuric acid. Ultrafine anatase form is precipitated from sulfate solution and ultrafine rutile from chloride solution. In the chloride process, natural or synthetic rutile is chlorinated at temperatures of 850‚Äì1000 ¬∞C, and the titanium tetrachloride is converted to the ultafine anatase form by vapor-phase oxidation. It is not possible to convert pigmentary TiO2 to ultrafine TiO2 by grinding. Ultrafine titanium dioxide could be obtained by different kind of processes as precipitation method, gas-phase reaktion, sol-gel method, and atomic layer deposition method.  Uses  Ultrafine TiO2 is believed to be one of the three most produced nanomaterials, along with silicon dioxide nanoparticles and zinc oxide nanoparticles. It is the second most advertised nanomaterial in consumer products, behind silver nanoparticles. Due to its long use as a commodity chemical, TiO2 can be considered a \\"legacy nanomaterial.\\" Ultrafine TiO2 is used in sunscreens due to its ability to block UV radiation while remaining transparent on the skin. TiO2 particles used in sunscreens typically have sizes in the range 5‚Äì50 nm. Ultrafine TiO2 is used in housing and construction as an additive to paints, plastics, cements, windows, tiles, and other products for its UV absorption and photocatalytic sterilizing properties, for example in antifogging coatings and self-cleaning windows. Engineered TiO2 nanoparticles are also used in light-emitting diodes and solar cells. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 can be used to decompose organic compounds in wastewater. TiO2 nanoparticle products are sometimes coated with silica or alumina, or doped with another metal for specific applications.  Health and safety   Consumer  For sunscreens, health risk from dermal exposure on intact skin are considered extremely low, and is outweighed by the risk of ultraviolet radiation damage including cancer from not wearing sunscreen. TiO2 nanoparticles are considered safer than other substances used for UV protection. However, there is concern that skin abrasions or rashes, or accidental ingestion of small amounts of sunscreen, are possible exposure pathways. Cosmetics containing nanomaterials are not required to be labeled in the United States, although they are in the European Union.  Occupational  Inhalation exposure is the most common route of exposure to airborne particles in the workplace. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has classified inhaled ultrafine TiO2 as a potential occupational carcinogen due to lung cancer risk in studies on rats, with a recommended exposure limit of 0.3 mg/m3 as a time-weighted average for up to 10 hr/day during a 40-hour work week. This is in contrast to fine TiO2 (which has particle sizes below ~4 Œºm), which had insufficient evidence to classify as a potential occupational carcinogen, and has a higher recommended exposure limit of 2.4 mg/m3. The lung tumor response observed in rats exposed to ultrafine TiO2 resulted from a secondary genotoxic mechanism related to the physical form of the inhaled particle, such as its surface area, rather than to the chemical compound itself, although there was insufficient evidence to corroborate this in humans. In addition, when finely dispersed in the air and in contact with a sufficiently strong ignition source, TiO2 nanoparticles may present a dust explosion hazard. Standard controls and procedures for the health and safety hazards of nanomaterials are relevant for TiO2 nanoparticles. Elimination and substitution, the most desirable approaches to hazard control, may be possible through choosing properties of the particle such as size, shape, functionalization, and agglomeration/aggregation state to improve their toxicological properties while retaining the desired functionality, or by replacing a dry powder with a slurry or suspension in a liquid solvent to reduce dust exposure. Engineering controls, mainly ventilation systems such as fume hoods and gloveboxes, are the primary class of hazard controls on a day-to-day basis. Administrative controls include training on best practices for safe handling, storage, and disposal of nanomaterials, proper labeling and warning signage, and encouraging a general safety culture. Personal protective equipment normally used for typical chemicals are also appropriate for nanomaterials, including long pants, long-sleeve shirts, closed-toed shoes, safety gloves, goggles, and impervious laboratory coats, and in some circumstances respirators may be used. Exposure assessment methods include use of both particle counters, which monitor the real-time quantity of nanomaterials and other background particles; and filter-based samples, which can be used to identify the nanomaterial, usually using electron microscopy and elemental analysis.  Environmental  Sunscreens containing TiO2 nanoparticles can wash off into natural water bodies, and can enter wastewater when people shower. Studies have indicated that TiO2 nanoparticles can harm algae and animals and can bioaccumulate and bioconcentrate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency generally does not consider physical properties such as particle size in classifying substances, and regulates TiO2 nanoparticles identically to other forms of TiO2. = Toxicity = Titanium dioxide has been found to be toxic to plants and small organisms such as worms, nematodes, and insects. The toxicity of TiO2 nanoparticles on nematodes increases with smaller nanoparticle diameter specifically 7 nm nanoparticles relative to 45 nm nanoparticles, but growth and reproduction are still affected regardless of the TiO2 nanoparticle size. The release of titanium dioxide into the soil can have a detrimental effect on the ecosystem in place due to its hindrance of proliferation and survival of soil invertebrates; it causes apoptosis as well as stunts growth, survival, and reproduction in these organisms. These invertebrates are responsible for the decomposition of organic matter and the progression of nutrient cycling in the surrounding ecosystem. Without the presence of these organisms, the soil composition would suffer.  Metrology  ISO/TS 11937 is a metrology standard for measuring several characteristics of dry titanium dioxide powder relevant for nanotechnology: crystal structure and anatase‚Äìrutile ratio can be measured using X-ray diffraction, average particle and crystallite sizes using X-ray diffraction or transmission electron microscopy, and specific surface area using the Brunauer‚ÄìEmmet‚ÄìTeller gas adsorption method. For workplace exposure assessment, NIOSH Method 0600 for mass concentration measurements of fine particles can be used for nanoparticles using an appropriate particle size-selective sampler, and if the size distribution is known then the surface area can be inferred from the mass measurement. NIOSH Method 7300 allows TiO2 to be distinguished from other aerosols by elemental analysis using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Electron microscopy methods equipped with energy- dispersive X-ray spectroscopy can also identify the composition and size of particles. NIST SRM 1898 is a reference material consisting of a dry powder of TiO2 nanocrystals. It is intended as a benchmark in environmental or toxicological studies, and for calibrating instruments that measure specific surface area of nanomaterials by the Brunauer‚ÄìEmmet‚ÄìTeller method.

It is not the pelike that this article is describing, but it is a similar shape. A pelike was a ceramic container that the Greeks used as storage/transportation for wine and olive oil. As seen in the picture on the right, it had a large belly with thin, open handles. Unlike other transportation jars (like the amphora), a pelike would have a flattened bottom so that it could stand on its own. Pelikes often had one large scene across the belly of the jar with minimal distractions around. This would focus the viewers eyes to the center of the pelike which was often a mythological scene of sorts.  Historical Context  This red-figure pelike was created by the Lykaon painter in the classical period (440 B.C.). During the classical period there were two major shifts in painting, both to do with representation of space. The first change was creating a \\"foreground\\" and \\"background.\\" In order to do this the figures in the higher section were the background while the figures in the lower section were the foreground. The pioneer of this change was Polygnotos of Thasos. The pelike with Odysseus and Elpenor in the Underworld is a great example of this first change. The second change was creating more backdrops for certain literary scenes. The Lykaon painter was well known for his unique style and his depiction of mythological scenes. This jar was one of the \\"earliest and by far most representation in ancient art of a famous passage in the Odyssey.\\"  Description  There were many features used by the Lyakon Painter to depict the mythological scene on this pelike. * The ground lines to show the rocky landscape and plants crawling up around the edges * Odysseus' arm is tensed holding the sword which shows he is ready to attack, but his other arm is resting against his leg and holding his head up which indicates a feeling of melancholy. This could represent the hardships he has endured and all the ones he will have to. * All the characters are looking at Elpenor yet the viewer knows the main focus of the jar is Odysseus because of the details on him and facial expression. Hermes is seen leaning in and almost handing a hand out towards and Elpenor is concentrating on moving towards Odysseus. * The progression from right to left: the viewer can only see Hermes (far right) in full profile, Odysseus is still in profile but there is a slight twist in his position so the viewer can see more of him, Elpenor (far left) is almost frontal and trying to pull himself. * Elpenor pulling himself up brings in this idea of irony because in the myth this pelike is depicting Elpenor is a ghost, yet he is the only person in this jar that is actively trying (and struggling) with moving himself when he should be the most free. Elpenor's pose is known as the 3/4 pose which is difficult to paint effectively. * Hermes is present on the jar which shows that the story is being told from a different point than the story in Homer which does not feature Hermes. The Lykaon painter did a fantastic job in characterizing each individual person. Instead of making them generic people and only recognizable through objects, he made them distinct characters. The viewer can see how young Elpenor was when he died. He has no beard and his hair is cut short. On the other hand, Odysseus has a full head of hair and a thick beard. He appears to be still, but the viewer can get a sense of the fighter in him since his foot is tip- toed and ready to spring into action. The hat he wears gives a sense of time. It is different from a helmet used in war, which suggests he is returning home. Hermes facial expression is very neutral which gives a sense of wisdom. Similarly to Odysseus, he looks very still, as his feet are planted on the ground, but his knees are bent which indicates he could jump up to help the two mortals. Normally if there is a God present in a painting, they are the center of attention. In this pelike, the positioning of the people allows for Odysseus to be the center of attention.  Theme  The story depicted on this jar is from a scene in the Odyssey. Odysseus was traveling to the Underworld to speak to a prophet when he ran into his deceased companion, Elpenor. Elpenor was the youngest member of Odysseus' crew. One night on Circe Island, Elpenor drank too much and tried to fall asleep on the roof; however, he fell off in his sleep and died. His death went unnoticed, so he was not given a proper burial and given those rights. Since he died without the proper burial, he is stuck in his journey through the Underworld. This mythological scene is when Odysseus runs into him and Elpenor begs him to give him a proper burial. Odysseus decides to sacrifice two lambs in order for Elpenor to continue through the Underworld. Hermes stands behind Odysseus as he is a guide for lost souls in the Underworld.

In 2016 he was awarded the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award.Professor Roman Frigg has won the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation‚Äôs prestigious Bessel Research Award at lse.ac.uk, 2016/05/10. Born in Basel, Switzerland, Frigg obtained his MSc in Theoretical Physics at the University of Basel. In 2003 he obtained his PhD in Philosophy at the University of London under Nancy Cartwright and Carl Hoefer with the thesis, entitled Re-presenting Scientific Representation. After graduation Frigg started his academic career at the London School of Economics. After some years he was appointed Professor of Philosophy in its Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method. He is also visiting professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich at its Munich Centre for Mathematical Philosophy.  Philosophy  Frigg's philosophy draws from his physics background. He often takes examples from the field to demonstrate how order is emergent, holistic, and contextual by universal and exceptionless laws. For instance, together with Robert Bishop, he explained that there is self- organization and patterns of emergent order in the universe rather than a system being built up just from independently calculated movement of its part. This theory is applied to explain phenomena such as heavenly bodies, global politics, and even family life, among others with the view that a domain is regarded as ordered once its objects are seen as behaving according to a general law. Along with some philosophers like Gabrielle Contessa and Peter Godfrey-Smith, Frigg also theorizes that there are parallels between theoretical modelling and works of fiction that involve fictional characters. For the philosopher, the best way to understand mathematical models is to approach it as if they were more closely related to literary fictions than to bits of mathematics. This can be demonstrated in the way Frigg draws from Kendall Walton's theory, which offers a framework of understanding games of make-believe and uses it to understand the nature and varieties of representation in the arts of art and fiction.Walton, Kendall L. \\"Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts\\". Harvard University Press, 1990 Frigg proposed that scientists' prepared descriptions are analogous to props in games of make believe and that the descriptions do not require imaginings about actual objects but ask us to imagine a model- system. It is believed that this approach addresses the concept of model individuation - that \\"if models are simply mathematical objects, then when two distinct models use the same mathematics, we will not be able to individuate them as separate objects.\\"  Selected publications  * Roman Frigg, Re- presenting Scientific Representation.

Biography Pellegrino Strobel was the fourth of the eight children of the Tyrolean nobleman Michael Str√∂bel, an official of the Habsburg government of the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia. He was born in Milan, in Palazzo Marino. In 1857 he moved to Piacenza then in 1859 to Parma, where his father had obtained the position of councillor administration of Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma. He was introduced to the study of natural history from a young age by his uncle Leonard Liebener, a well-known naturalist, and Alexander von Humboldt, a friend of the family. He attended the gymnasium in Merano and graduated in law in Innsbruck in 1842. He studied natural sciences in Pavia but did not graduate, but was given the title doctor of natural sciences on March 10, 1872 while teaching in Parma. He was a member of numerous scientific institutions of international importance: in 1857 he was appointed professor of natural history in Piacenza in the \\"optional\\" schools, then on 6 December 1859 he was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Parma, where he was also a professor of mineralogy, geology and zoology. He collaborated with Luigi Pigorini to study the lake-dwelling Terramara in a work which included paleontology, botany, zoology, entomology, palynology, geology, anthropology and archaeology, to build a complete picture of these Bronze Age communities.Le terremare e le palafitte del Parmense (subtitle) seconda relazione del prof. P. Strobel e di L. Pigorini Tipi di G. Bernadoni, Milano (1864) In 1864 he was appointed to set up the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires. He participated in numerous exploration trips in Patagonia and the Andes, about which he published numerous anthropological and ethnological studies and of which he would organize one of the most important collections of molluscs. He returned to Europe on the death of his father and resumed teaching at the University of Parma, of which he was elected rector in 1891. He is especially remembered for notable studies on the culture of the Terramare and on the civilizations of the Bronze Age of Italy, as well as for his research on the molluscs of Italy. He died of heart disease in 1895 in his villa in Vignale, a hamlet in the commune of Traversetolo, near Parma.

By the decree of 30 thermidor an II (17 August 1794), Faure- Conac was sent on a mission with Bernard Thomas Tr√©houart to the ports of Brest and Lorient, for which the committee of inspectors allocated 6000 livres on (18 August 1794). During this mission, they learned from the authorities of Bergen in Norway that French sailors had helped to extinguish a major fire in the city. On 20 frimaire an III (10 December 1794), with his colleague, Faure- Conac sent to the Committee of Public Safety, the 171 decrees made during their trip, which were then redistributed to other committees. Recalled by the degree of 2 vent√¥se an III (20 February 1795), he was replaced by Julien- Fran√ßois Palasne de Champeaux and Jean-Nicolas Topsent.Michel Biard, ibid, p. 226 et 502. At the Convention, he opposed the plan by Marie-Beno√Æt-Louis Gouly regarding the reorganisation of naval artillery. Elected by the same department for the Conseil des Cinq-Cents on 21 vend√©miaire an IV (13 October 1795) by 151 votes from 218 voters, Faure-Conac was promoted to captain on 22 September 1796, as commander of the frigate Bravoure. On 8 vent√¥se an V (26 February 1797) he resigned his political position to serve in the Navy. Between 1799 and 1809, he commanded Indivisible, Bravoure, Constitution, and Cassard. On 4 January 1811, he was named commandant of the √âcole de marine de Brest, on board the school-ship Tourville until 1814. He was made an honorary contre-amiral on 1 January 1816 and retired to Ch√©n√©railles. He was made an officier of the L√©gion d'honneur and a chevalier de Saint-Louis.

After that, Ivorian referee Joseph Lougbo gave another standing-8 count against the Mongolian, which should have terminated the bout, according to international rules. In the third round, however, Pagendam was rocked by a punch to the head by Tserendorj, and Lougbo stopped the bout, awarding the Mongolian the win. Afterwards, Canada protested, contending that Pagendam had actually won the bout in the second round. The protest was upheld, and AIBA announced that the referee was suspended for the rest of the Games. Later however, the Canadians were informed that although Pagendam was the winner of the bout, he could not continue in the tournament for medical reasons.

It is co-written by Clarkson and its producers‚ÄîJussifer, NOVA Wav duo Denisia Andrews and Brittany Coney, Fade Majah, and Jesse Shatkin. A soul anthem about female empowerment, the singer declares herself as a \\"whole lotta woman\\" and challenges men to \\"accept it or walk away\\". Songwriters put a \\"fun twist\\" in the lyrics to allude to the size of Clarkson's waistline, her attitude, her self-worth, and her mouth. Members of the American soul band Earth, Wind & Fire, led by bass player Verdine White, are featured in the song. On the week of the album's release, Clarkson premiered \\"Whole Lotta Woman\\" in a live performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In celebration of the 2018 International Day of the Girl Child, Clarkson performed the song on The Today Show. Critical reception of the song was mixed. It reached number 142 on Billboard's US Digital Songs chart.  Writing and composition  \\"Whole Lotta Woman\\" was co-written by Clarkson and producers Jussifer (Jussi Karvinen), NOVA Wav (Denisia Andrews and Brittany Coney), Fade Majah (Evon Barnes Jr.), and Jesse Shatkin. In a feature on Rolling Stone, Clarkson commented that the song stemmed from a conversation she had with the NOVA Wav duo in a session in Los Angeles. She recalled, \\"It was really fun to talk to them about how it took me awhile to fall in love because I am a whole lot of woman ‚Äì I have a big personality. I'm a grown-ass woman that can pay her bills, and I make a lot of money. That's intimidating.\\" Clarkson, who grew up in Texas, remarked in a profile on The New York Times that the song's inspiration came from the challenges of being a financially secure woman looking for a man after internalizing the paradoxes of growing up in the South. Clarkson says that in the South women are told, \\"We want to educate you and we want you to be intelligent, but not too intelligent to where you're intimidating; we want you to be beautiful, but not too sexy to where you're a slut; we want you to be successful but not so successful that you make someone feel uncomfortable.‚Äù As a female pop singer, Clarkson has expressed frustration that for years her appearance, particularly her weight, has been a constant topic of discussion. This led her to write a song that said \\"Yeah, you're right, I am a whole lot of woman, and it's ok. I came with a brain, and I came with drive and passion and sensuality, and these things that are awesome. If you can't handle it, that's totally cool, but you're not tall enough to ride this ride, then move along. It's fine.\\" Members of the American soul band Earth, Wind & Fire, led by bass player Verdine White (pictured), were invited by Atlantic Records CEO Craig Kallman to play on the track. \\"Whole Lotta Woman\\" is an anthem that utilizes a bass-heavy groove. The lyrics allude to the size of Clarkson's waistline, her attitude, her self- worth, and her mouth using references to Southern cooking and singer Tina Turner. Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone says \\"the music recalls classic soul anthems like 'Respect' while also having the pop of Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation-era output like 'Black Cat. Craig Kallman, CEO of Atlantic Records, executive produced the album with Clarkson, and commissioned the horn section of Earth, Wind & Fire, along with its bass player, Verdine White, to perform on the song.  Critical reception  In a feature in The New York Times, Caryn Ganz described the song as a \\"feisty throwdown\\" and a centerpiece to Meaning of Life. Stacey Leasca of Glamour picked the track as the favorite from the album. Idolator's Mike Wass referred it as one of the album's highlights. Reviewing the album for The Atlantic, Spencer Kornhamer wrote that the song verges on \\"the edge of feeling like costume play‚Äîbut Clarkson connects the revival-church sound to her biography, playing up her Texan bona fides\\" and praised its outro as \\"fascinating, mutating into a trap breakdown but with women singing that style's 'hey' rhythm like doo-wop.\\" Glenn Gamboa of Newsday observed that Clarkson looks to innovate as \\"she takes a throwback soul arrangement to the song and adds intricate, current R&B; phrasing and lyrics like 'I'm a strong, bad-ass chick with classic confidence' to create something new\\". Los Angeles Times' Michael Wood noted that \\"she lays out the makings of a 'badass chick with classic confidence' in the song, but ends up with a 'pile of Southern clich√©s and added that it \\"plays like a female answer to 'Boys 'Round Here by Blake Shelton. Hannah Davies of The Guardian wrote that song feels like \\"a filler\\", and described its \\"body-positive pop\\" as sticking a \\"little too closely to the Meghan Trainor mould.\\" Whereas Spin magazine's Katherine St. Asaph wrote that the song's lyrics felt \\"forced\\" and described it as \\"where soul becomes vaguely appropriative, sub-Austin Powers caricature.\\"  Live performances  To promote the album's release, Clarkson debuted \\"Whole Lotta Woman\\" in a performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on October 31, 2017. She also filmed a \\"Nashville Sessions\\" performance of the song at the War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, which was released on November 2, 2017.

It is bordered by Coombe Road to the south and Lloyd Park Avenue to the west. To the north, access is from Deepdene and Mapledale Avenue, and the park adjoins Grimwade Avenue and Addiscombe Cricket Club. To the east the park is bordered by Shirley Park Golf Course. It was created from land owned by Frank Lloyd, a newspaper proprietor who died in 1927 which was bequeathed to the Borough of Croydon by his family, after his death. Tramlink Route 3 runs along the southern edge of the park parallel to Coombe Road. Description and usage The park is not enclosed, as would typically be the case for suburban parks. Coombe Road is bordered by a low hedge and grass-covered earth banks have been raised along the open Lloyd Park Avenue side to deter vehicular access. It is open 24 hours a day throughout the year. The main entrance is from Coombe Road, immediately adjacent to the Lloyd Park tram stop, where two car-parking areas are available. 'The Lounge Cafe' is also sited next to the car parks. Facilities available include rugby and football pitches, bowls, hard court tennis, children's playground, car parking, cafe, open-air gymnasium, disc golf, changing rooms and facilities, orienteering, cross country courses, horse riding and a pond. Towards the northern edge of the park is an area known as The Squashes, where a line of springs emerge during wet weather, the most frequent being Rippingill. Until 2010, the park was regularly used for the Croydon Summer Festival, hosting a variety of musical acts including, Martha and the Vandellas, The Proclaimers, The Lightning Seeds, The Damned and Courtney Pine.

Built in 1835, the building is located on Knez Mihailova Street, the commercial hub of downtown Belgrade. For decades, it was one of the favorite kafanas in the city, but it was closed in 2007.  Location  Grƒçka Kraljica is located at 51 Knez Mihailova street, near the end of the street and close to Kalemegdan Park, in the municipality of Stari Grad. It is situated on the corner of Knez Mihailova and Rajiƒáeva streets. West of the building, across the Rajiƒáeva, is the Faculty of Fine Arts, part of University of Arts in Belgrade. To the north and northwest, across the Knez Mihailova, are the City Library and the Rajiƒáeva Shopping Mall.  History   Origin  The lot on which the building was constructed was location of one of the three water towers which made city waterworks during the Ottoman period. The Ottomans constructed an aqueduct (ƒëeriz), to conduct water from the springs in the area of Veliki Mokri Lug. In downtown, they built three water towers: one at Terazije, another at Ruski Car and third where Grƒçka Kraljica is today. With pipes, the water was being lifted in the towers to give it additional force for further flow. The land was purchased by Despot Stefanoviƒá who built the one floor edifice in 1835. The author of the project is not known and the venue became a kafana (meyhane) immediately, named Despotov han (\\"Despots khan\\") after its owner and didn't change its purpose in the next 172 years, until it was closed. The building has a cellar and a backyard, while the floor was adapted into the rooms for rent. Originally, there were 8 rooms, later 11 and then 14, when the upper floor with 8 rooms was added in the c1850. After a while, the upper floor was adapted into the residential space.  19th century  The venue is considered an important point in the development of the city's catering industry but also for history in general. On an incident happened at the ƒåukur Fountain in the Dobraƒçina street, southeast of \\"Despot's khan\\". At that time, the Turks still administered the Belgrade Fortress, just west of the khan, as Serbia still wasn't de jure independent. Turkish soldiers, nizams, came to the fountain and a quarrel ensued between the Turks and a young Serbian merchant apprentice, Sava Petkoviƒá, who was then killed by the nizams. Serbian gendarmes arrived quickly and arrested the Turks. However, other nizams arrived and a verbal dispute began. An interpreter with the Belgrade police, Sima Ne≈°iƒá, tried to mediate between the Turkish soldiers and the Serbian gendarmes, but the Turks started shooting, killing Ne≈°iƒá. The commander of the Serbian guard, Ivko Prokiƒá, tried to remove the Turks from the scene but more shots were fired and the incident escalated into a city- wide conflict which lasted the entire night, with Prokiƒá also being killed by the Turks. The news about the incident spread around Belgrade, and Serbian armed rioters quickly overtook the Varo≈° Gate and destroyed the Sava and Stambol gates. On the following day, a truce was worked out by the foreign consuls in the city, especially John Augustus Longworth, British Consul- General. Under the terms of the truce, the Pasha in charge of the fortress agreed to remove his police from the town and the Serbian prime minister, Ilija Gara≈°anin, in turn, guaranteed their safety during the move. A day later, the pasha summoned the consuls to the fortress and while they were still underway, 56 fortress cannons began to shell Belgrade. About 50 civilians and soldiers died, about 20 houses were burnt down, and another 357 damaged. Shelling lasted from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. That was the day when funerals for Ne≈°iƒá and Prokiƒá were held. An official, ceremonial procession was passing through the main city streets when the shelling began. Serbian Prince Mihajlo Obrenoviƒá utilized the incident and in April 1867, the Turks completely withdrew from Serbia.V. Bubanj, The Drinking Fountains of Belgrade, Belgrade, 1986, 27‚Äì39S. G. Bogunoviƒá, Architectural encyclopaedia of Belgrade of the XIX and XX century, Architecture (I), Belgrade 2005M. Timotijeviƒá, The Myth about the national hero saviour and the erection of the monument to the Duke Mihailo M. Obrenoviƒá III, Heritage IV, Belgrade 2002. During the fighting in June 1862, Serbs formed their stand behind the still unfinished Captain Mi≈°a's Mansion, and in front of \\"Despot's khan\\". As the khan was always full, there were stories around the town that Stefanoviƒá is also hosting prostitutes. Though this apparently wasn't the case, Stefanoviƒá decided to sell the venue as the rumors began to affect his business. He sold the building to the banker Jovan Kumanudi, a member of the Kumanudi family. Jovan adapted it into the hotel and changed the name to \\"Hotel Grƒçka Kraljica\\", as the Kumanudi family was of Greek origin. When Turkish pasha handed over the keys to the city to Prince Mihajlo on 18 April 1867, it was also close to the venue. It was the beginning of the period when the kafanas in Belgrade, from Oriental-style inns, transformed into the European-type restaurants, in appearance, service and menus. After Jovan died in 1866, his children became the owners, first his son Andrija, also a banker, and later his daughter Mileva. Leaseholders included Janko Lazareviƒá (c. 1860), Aleksa Dimitrijeviƒá (c. 1896) and Dragutin Daniƒçiƒá (c. 1922). After 1945, when the new Communist authorities came to power, they confiscated and nationalized the venue.  20th century  The building achieved a rare feat for the edifices in Belgrade: it wasn't damaged or destroyed during all the major troubles. The riots during the May Coup in 1903 (when king and queen, Alexander Obrenoviƒá and Draga Ma≈°in were killed), World War I, World War II (both the massive and destructive German bombing of Belgrade in 1941 and Allied Easter bombing in 1944), Communist revolution 1944/45. Though upgraded and renovated on several occasions, thanks to not being destroyed, the building for the most part preserved its authentic exterior. After the Communist government took over, the name was changed to Plavi Jadran (\\"Blue Adriatic\\") in the 1950s and the disco was later opened in the cellar. Originally named Zvezda (\\"Star\\") and later renamed to \\"Metro\\", it was a very popular city venue. The ground floor and the cellar were renovated and expanded in 1990, and the restaurant was ceremonially opened by mayor of Belgrade , under the old name, \\"Grƒçka Kraljica\\". Though always full, especially as a favorite inn of the merchants and travelers, the venue wasn't considered much of a distinguished one during the 19th century. After the World War II it became very popular and was particularly known as one of the favorite meeting places for the \\"morning coffee\\". It was described as a \\"beautiful and beloved restaurant of older Belgraders\\" and a place visited for a drink or a lunch after a walk in Kalemegdan Park. Especially popular was the pastry shop in the right wing of the building. The state owned catering company \\"Tri grozda\\" became a leaseholder in 1969 and the ownership was transferred to the municipally owned \\"Poslovni prostor Stari Grad\\". \\"Tri grozda\\" closed \\"Grƒçka Kraljica\\" in 2007 for the impending renovation. The State construction inspection in 2008 concluded that \\"Tri grozda\\" doesn't have all the necessary permits because the building, though not protected by the law itself, is part of the Knez Mihailova Spatial Cultural-Historical Unit of Exceptional Importance. \\"Tri grozda\\" stopped the reconstruction, and not only failed to obtain the permits, but went bankrupt in 2012.  Recent  \\"Poslovni prostor Stari Grad\\" held no biddings for the new leaseholder in the next years, and, left as it was, the building deteriorated. The windows got broken and the fa√ßade was vandalized with the graffiti. On 1 December 2016 City of Belgrade took over the ownership from the \\"Poslovni prostor Stari Grad\\" and leased the venue. In May 2017, 10 years after it was closed, the construction works on the reconstruction continued. The woodworks, windows and doors, were replaced and the windows were glazed with the new glass. The interior was cleared of the rubble. However, it is not known who is the new leaseholder and what will be the purpose of the reconstructed building. Despite journalists' questions, city officials didn't disclose the information, while on the location, no one wished to speak to the reporters. Unofficial reports claim that the venue will not be in the catering business anymore. In November 2017 it was announced that the leaseholder is \\"Reina Amalia\\" company, since November 2014. \\"Stari Grad\\" didn't send invoices to the leaseholder for the first 2 years as, per agreement, \\"Reina Amalia\\" was to renovated the building with its own funds instead. When city took over, they began charging the lease, but the leaseholder reported problems with obtaining the permits from the city and quarrels with the neighbors, so they halted works. As they didn't pay any lease, city hanged a reminder notification on the venue's door, but didn't declare the contract void. Despite being on an exquisite location, as of 2020 \\"Grƒçka Kraljica\\" remains closed.  Mural in Rajiƒáeva  Mural in Rajiƒáeva before the 2018 renovation. Grƒçka Kraljica is the indented building on the left The venue is located at the corner of the Knez Mihailova and Rajiƒáeva streets, and the building in 19 Rajiƒáeva Street which leans on Grƒçka Kraljica, towers it, being much higher. As it is also wider than the building in which the restaurant is located, there was a large section of fa√ßade, without windows, facing the venue and the Knez Mihailova. In 1984 a group of art students, under the guidance of a painter and their professor ƒåedomir Vasiƒá, painted a mural. It depicts an art student from behind, holding a sketchbook under his arm. He is gazing above, at the waterfall of colors which flow from the top of the building. The original sketch was drafted by Perica Donkov, while the student was modeled after Mirko Ognjanoviƒá, who also worked on the piece. In 1982, the Center for the planning of the urban development of Belgrade, at the \\"Communications\\" conference, considered the idea of fixing the fa√ßades by painting murals. In 1983, the Arts Academy offered drafted artworks for 50 fa√ßades to the city hall. It was part of Academy's initiative of \\"artistic intervention\\", instigated by the students solutions for the walls and buildings which have no architectural merits for preservation, but which still can change the panoramic view of the city, and to fill the \\"urban emptiness\\". The Rajiƒáeva location, which was the \\"Beobanka\\" bank at the time, was approved the first by city officials, though at the same time another mural was painted on the \\"20th October\\" cinema, by the French Cultural Center. The mural was done within the Youth Day celebrations, held on 25 May each year. Vasiƒá even spent one night in police detention, until the CEO of \\"Beobanka\\" wasn't assured by the city that the painting of the mural was legally approved. Though in Belgrade few murals were done earlier, like in 1970 in the Bulevar Revolucije or in 1979 on the Western City Gate (both by Lazar Vujaklija), as the first in this period, the mural in Rajiƒáeva fueled the muralism movement, labeled the \\"fixing of the city\\" by the artists which wished to offer passersby a different feel from the empty and naked walls. Vasiƒá stated that this way art prevents urban space from being faceless. Though over 50 murals were painted in Belgrade since then by numerous artists (from 1984 to 1997 Vasiƒá and his students painted several other murals), the mural in Rajiƒáeva has been labeled as \\"legendary\\". In time, both the elements and the graffiti damaged it. It was renovated in 2003 but deteriorated again. It was fully reconstructed in September 2018.

With that said, Dr Rajan himself is of the view that the data available currently is not fully substantive to determine if the program could be deemed a success.

She established one of the first independent human rights organizations in Latin America and fought for both women's equality and an end to state-sponsored terrorism under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. She was influential in passing legislation for pay equity and maternity rights, as well as securing the repeal of laws curtailing basic human rights. Born into an influential family, Casco was educated as a teacher and taught from the end of the 1930s to 1965. Having relatives sent into exile and witnessing the devastation of two wars, she was propelled into working to alleviate the suffering of those who were more marginalized than she. Initially she began working on issues involving women and political prisoners. When elected to serve on the 1967 Constitutional Assembly, she worked to have basic human rights added to the Paraguayan Constitution. One of the founders of the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights of Paraguay, she became its president and served in that capacity until her death. Unable to prosecute those who abused others' liberties, the organization focused on providing aid to victims but also compiled information on those who had been forcibly \\"disappeared\\". Elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1968, Casco was an outspoken opponent of the dictatorial regime and was the target of state surveillance, imprisonment and intimidation. She served until 1977, when she resigned in protest to an amendment of the Constitution which allowed Stroessner unlimited terms as president. She was one of the parties involved in securing the release of political prisoners from the Ambush Concentration Camp. Throughout the 1980s, she traveled extensively trying to make the international community aware of human rights abuses in Paraguay so that they could apply pressure on the government to end reprisals against citizens. When Stroessner was ousted in 1989, she was elected as a Senator, serving in that capacity for the rest of her life. In 1992, when the archives of the Central Police Department of Investigations, known as the Terror Files, were unearthed, she became president of the Senate investigation into the records. The commission discovered that the Technical Affairs Department of the Ministry of the Interior was still operating and shut it down. That same year, she was honored by the United Nations for her contributions to human rights and humanity. Casco died in 1993 and is remembered for her record of defending human rights. Schools and monuments in Paraguay bear her name, and her likeness adorns a stamp issued by the Paraguayan government in 2000. Early life Carmen Elida de Jesus Casco Miranda was born on 17 June 1918 in Paraguay to L√≠dia Miranda Cueto and Ferm√≠n Casco Esp√≠noza. She was baptized on 6 August 1918 in Asunci√≥n. Her father made a military career in the Paraguayan army and fought in the Chaco War. Her mother's sister, Julia Miranda Cueto, was married to the military hero and later President of Paraguay, Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia. One of seven children, she had four sisters and two brothers. Casco's family was well-known, of aristocratic background, and had high social and political standing. Casco attended primary school at Colegio Mar√≠a Auxiliadora in Asunci√≥n and went on to study to be a teacher at La Providencia College. During her schooling, the Chaco War broke out, and though there was no fighting in Asunci√≥n, the family could not help but be affected since her father and uncle were both involved in the war. The ensuing political upheavals, sent her uncle Estigarribia, with whom her family were close, into exile. Her schooling included study of both French and Guarani languages, as well as the typical religious education. Early career and family Casco began her career teaching civics and French at the College La Providencia and Normal School #3. She also taught at the Lyceum San Carlos. In 1940, Casco married Mariano Lu√≠s Lara Castro, who had been a soldier in the Chaco Wars, a lawyer and professor at the Catholic University of Asunci√≥n. Lara's father was Ram√≥n Lara Castro, a journalist, president of the Paraguayan Institute of Historical Investigations and at one time served as the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs in Brazil. That same year, her uncle Estigarribia, who at the time was President of Paraguay was killed in an airplane crash, throwing the country into chaos. Both Casco and her husband adhered to the Liberal Party, even after it was banned by Estigarribia's successor, Higinio Mor√≠nigo. Mor√≠nigo, the only candidate on the 1943 ballot, ruled as an authoritarian president through persecution and banishment. Opposition resulted in the Paraguayan Civil War. When it ended in 1947, Casco became involved with helping political prisoners, as almost all of her maternal family had been exiled to Argentina and her paternal family lost all their property in Asunci√≥n. Her husband was also forced into exile, living briefly in Argentina and Uruguay, before his return to Paraguay in October 1947. Casco did not accompany him, as she was near the end of her third pregnancy and remained in Asunci√≥n alone with her sons Luis (born 1942) and Jorge (born 1945). Fernando (born 1948), was born soon after the Civil War ended and was followed by three more sons: Jos√© (born 1953), Ferm√≠n (born 1956), and Mart√≠n (born 1960). After both the Chaco War and the Civil War, her family lost their property and were sent into exile, leading Casco to become involved in human rights. Women's and human rights work By her own account, Casco began working with women's groups around 1946, mainly because she had the support of her brother Adolfo. While as a woman she had no real political power, she felt she had been less marginalized than others. Initially, women helped each other with social service needs, but in 1953, she and other professional women founded the Intituto Cultural de Amparo a la Mujer (Cultural Institute of Refuge for Women). Made up primarily of teachers, with a few doctors and lawyers, their objective was to counsel women and assist them in overcoming societal impediments, such as poor pay, discrimination, poverty, lack of health care, though at times they provided material support. They also attempted to refer women to other benevolent associations that might be able to help them. In 1954, a coup d'etat brought the dictator Alfredo Stroessner to power and within two years, he issued a decree banning the Institute and placing the women who organized it on lists of suspicious persons. The group did not disband, but instead transformed into the Women's Department of the Liberal Party, though in fact, the Liberal Party was still an illegal organization, as the one-party state was limited to the Colorado Party. Women were not allowed to run for office or participate in any decision-making process. Instead they performed benevolent works, visiting prisoners, raising money, hosting meetings and providing food for functions. The 1960s in Paraguay were characterized by repressive violence, armed attacks by soldiers and reprisals by guerrillas, which led to hundreds of deaths and imprisonment of political dissidents. Alternating waves of violence and conciliation served to strengthen fear and consolidate presidential power. In fact, women's suffrage was not achieved in Paraguay until 1961, and was not granted by means of women's agitation, as all forms of dissent were punished and democratization was extinguished. Rather, enfranchisement was granted because President Stroessner wanted to bolster his support with women who might influence voters. As early as 1962, together with Mar√≠a Campos Cervera, Mar√≠a Elena de P√©rez, Mary del Pino, and Beatriz M√©ndez de Prieto, Casco established another organization they called Amparo a la Mujer (Refuge for Women) to continue the work they had begun in 1953. In 1963, a women's journal, Cu√±atai, was launched, facilitating participation of women in the political arena, with Casco serving as the director. The journal survived for a year and a half. During all this time, Casco had continued teaching in various schools in Asunci√≥n, but in 1965 she stopped teaching and turned her focus to politics. In 1965, Casco became the president of the Primero Congreso Feminino liberal (First Liberal Feminist Congress) in which both women and men discussed women's civil and political roles in Paraguayan society. They addressed women's education, employment, and civic and social issues. In 1966, a new Constitution was proposed; Casco ran and was elected to the Constitutional Assembly. Although she was a member of the Liberal Party, her election was facilitated by her family connections, her involvement in human rights, and her support for both conservative and anti-communist views. Replacing the Constitution of 1940, the new Constitution was notable in that it had provisions for protecting human rights, including banning denial of habeas corpus and protections from mistreatment or torture. It also allowed for political opposition to re-emerge, prompting several former political leaders to return from exile, and protected individual rights, including the freedoms of association and movement. However, to gain those provisions delegates had to continue the executive authority over both the legislative and judicial branches of government and grant President Stroessner the ability to hold two additional five-year terms as president. President Alfredo Stroessner On 17 June 1967, Casco, Jer√≥nimo Irala Burgos, Lu√≠s Alfonso Resck, and others founded the Comisi√≥n de Defensa de los Derechos Humanos del Paraguay (Commission for the Defense of Human Rights of Paraguay), \\"one of the first independent human rights organizations in Latin America\\". It was founded on Casco's forty-ninth birthday, a date which may have been chosen because it would not have raised suspicions. The Commission did not have much support at its inception and was viewed as subversive by the autocratic regime; however, it was created as part of the Constitutional revision. Casco was elected as the first president of the Commission and strictly adhered to the belief that all people were born equal and had the same rights, regardless of ideology, or differences in their economic, political, religious, or social status. During the Stroessner era, fear of reprisal curtailed the reporting of many human rights abuses. The few cases which were reported were often obstructed by the court system, which Stroessner controlled. For many years, the Commission was the only human rights organization in the country which denounced the violence of the regime and attempted to assist political prisoners. To outside observers, the Commission appeared to be an ineffective, opposition party organ designed to denounce the government, but records in the Terror Files and memories of prisoners and their families report that Casco regularly helped families find lost members, placing notices of missing persons in newspapers (which also kept the public informed of frequent kidnappings) while denouncing state-sponsored terrorism thanks to her position on the Congress of Paraguay. She was assisted in these tasks by numerous men and women, who were willing to help if they could remain in the background. Under the guise of delivering food, these helpers, usually women, gathered information. Public service career Chamber of Deputies, Asunci√≥n, Paraguay Casco was elected as a National Deputy for the Radical Liberal Party in 1968, along with two women from the Colorado Party and re-elected in 1973, when two new female Deputies, Leonidas Paez de Virgilli and Ligia Prieto Centuri√≥n, were also elected. Almost immediately she began working to improve the situation of prisoners. At the time, prisoners were held in cells which had no beds or mattresses, no toilets, and were provided with no food. She demanded that the conditions improve and that all political prisoners be released. Simultaneously, through the Commission, she met regularly with prisoners' families and provided them with material and moral support. Her outspokenness resulted in constant harassment, physical abuse from government operatives, repeated arrests, and vilification in the press. Two of her sons, as well as one of her brothers and a brother-in-law, were also arrested and tortured. Her mail was monitored, her telephone was tapped, and she was unable to obtain a passport. If she traveled abroad, she had to obtain international documents to do so. She successfully worked on legislation that would provide women with equal pay and maternity rights. In 1974, she submitted a bill to authorize 24 February as the Dia de la Mujer Paraguaya (Day of the Paraguayan Woman) to celebrate the contributions of women to the Triple Alliance War, when they donated their jewels to fund the defense of the country and war expenses. The date was chosen by historian Idalia Flores de Zarza in recognition of the date when the women of Asunci√≥n hosted the First Assembly of Women of the Americas. In 1977, when President Stroessner called for another Constitutional Assembly to allow indefinite re-election for the Paraguayan Presidency, Casco formed a protest by inviting leaders of the various liberal parties to unite in opposition to the regime. When they failed to form a coalition, she urged them to boycott the election and resigned her seat as a Deputy. In 1978, Casco joined with Carlos Alberto Gonz√°lez, Domingo La√≠no, Miguel √Ångel Mart√≠nez Yaryes and others to form the Authentic Radical Liberal Party. The same year, in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, she organized and hosted the First Congress of Human Rights. The conference was held in the fonoplatea (live studio) of , despite its being prohibited by the regime. The event was attended by over 400 people; according to the police dossier on the event, there were many international participants. Around the same time, she began working with activists from the Juventud Paraguaya por los Derechos Humanos (JPDH) (Paraguayan Youth for Human Rights) organization. JPDH aimed to free all political prisoners by Christmas 1978, especially those held in the Emboscada Campo de Concentraci√≥n (Ambush Concentration Camp), which included such figures as Alfredo Alcorta, , and , members of the Paraguayan Communist Party, who had been arrested for their actions during the 1958 Paraguayan general strike. Combining their skills, Casco and Resck used international pressure, and Roberto Paredes led a raid by the JPDH on the Palacio de los L√≥pez, to force the closure of the camp. The two groups worked together, though some members of the JPDH thought the privilege accorded to Casco because of her family position made her both less willing to take risks and unable to relate to issues of the masses; conversely, she felt that the subversive ideologies of the radicals within JPDH would undermine the work of the Commission. Though there was no immediate reaction from the government to these actions, in 1979, Casco was exiled from the Radical Liberal Party, brought before the judge of the Criminal Court of First Instance and denounced by the government. Despite these attempts to intimidate her, Casco was unrepentant, hosting two additional Human Rights Congresses during the dictatorship in 1982 and 1987. She regularly participated in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights review process and on more than one occasion was personally the subject of concern for having her rights violated. Casco also began traveling internationally in the 1980s, attending conferences on human rights. In 1980, she traveled to London at the invitation of Liberal International to discuss human rights in her country. She was arrested in 1981 after returning from a trip to Germany and again in 1988 when returning from a trip to Spain. It was alleged that she had taken part in a march, La Converg√™ncia Nacional por Los Derechos Humanos (The National Convergence for Human Rights), held to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but in reality, she was arrested in the airport returning from Europe. Stroessner was finally overthrown by a coup d‚Äôetat led by Andr√©s Rodr√≠guez in 1989 and in the election which followed Casco was elected to serve in the Senate. She introduced measures to repeal Laws 209, the Law for Defense of the Public Peace and Personal Freedom which made dissent or fostering dissent a crime, and 294, the Law for the Defense of Democracy which outlawed communism and armed rebellion against the government. In December 1992, the archives of Stroessner's organized human rights abuses, known as the Terror Files were uncovered. Contained in the collection of documents created by the Departmento de Investigaciones del la Policia Central (DIPC) (Central Police Department of Investigations), were detailed records on forced disappearances, kidnappings, murder, political prisoners, surveillance, and torture. The records provided documentation that regular reports of the activity of the DIPC were submitted to the president and that Paraguay had participated in Operation Condor, a network of South American countries which clandestinely exchanged political prisoners. On 23 December 1992, the day following their discovery, Casco formed a parliamentary delegation to investigate the evidence found. Elected to serve as president of the Senate's Human Rights Commission, the delegation discovered that the Technical Affairs Department of the Ministry of the Interior was still operating an illegal detention center under the direction of Antonio Campos Alum and took steps to shut down the operation of state terrorism. She was honored by the United Nations for her contributions to human rights and humanity in 1992, along with her husband. Death and legacy In April 1993, suffering from complications of diabetes, Casco entered the hospital in Asunci√≥n, where she died on 8 May 1993. After her remains were laid in state at the National Congress, she was buried in the cemetery at Recoleta. In 2000, a commemorative stamp was issued by the Paraguyan Government bearing her likeness and honoring her commitment to women's rights. A high school, Colegio Nacional Do√±a Carmen Casco de Lara Castro, San Pedro, Paraguay was named in her honor, as was a technical college in the city of Itaugu√°. There is a street in Encarnaci√≥n which bears her name. In 2006, a tribute was held to her memory in the Carmen Casco de Lara Castro Square of the San Pablo neighborhood in Asunci√≥n. This square had formerly been named after Stroessner and was renamed when a bill to remove honors bestowed upon him was passed by the legislature. Casco has been recognized with programs recognizing her work for Paraguay's Human Rights Week, Paraguayan Women's Day, and International Women's Day. Scholarship from Argentina, Brazil and France has evaluated the importance of her career in the development of women's agency, human rights and emerging democracy after the dictatorship in Paraguay. Comparisons between her experiences in Paraguay and those of other leading women figures in other countries, who also emerged from dictatorships, give insight into how upper and middle-class women were able to take the lead in attaining rights in their countries.

Between 1650 and 1550 BCE, a disastrous earthquake, followed by a volcanic eruption, covered Akrotiri in a thick layer of pumice and ash, which resulted in the remarkable conservation of frescoes, including the Akrotiri Boxer Fresco, from multiple buildings throughout the town. This particular fresco was found in room B1 of Building Beta along with the Antelope Fresco. The boys' shaved heads and stray locks indicate their youth, while their darker skin tone indicates their gender. The boy on the right is completely nude except for a belt, whereas the boy on the left has jewelry; most likely markers of a higher status. They appear to be slightly over life size at roughly 5'10\\". In order to create such vibrant frescoes, a smooth lime plaster was applied to the walls and then painted over. It is unsure if the match was a competitive one or simply a routine sport.  Volcanic Eruption  The volcanic eruption on the island of Thera, also known as Santorini, was one of the largest plinian eruptions in the past 10,000 years, with a range of 30-40 cubic kilometers. An eruption of this size would have most likely generated a tsunami over 100 feet tall, traveling across the Aegean Sea and decimating populations in its path. The size of this eruption had far-reaching impacts on the environment and civilizations in the region, primarily the Minoans. The thick layer of pumice and ash from the volcano covered the island and preserved much of the ancient civilization for thousands of years. As a result, several pieces of Minoan artwork, primarily the frescoes, were preserved as fragments in the rubble, and have been reassembled by archaeologists. These frescoes provide modern society with an invaluable insight into the daily lives of the Cycladic people.  Spinal Deformity  The Akrotiri Boxer Fresco may have been the first example of a sports-related deformity ever recorded. The young boy on the right appears to have spondylolisthesis.  Role of Boxing in Minoan Culture  Bull-Leaping Fresco The Minoans practiced several sports, including wrestling, bull jumping, acrobatics, and of course: boxing. This is apparent in multiple pieces of art, ranging from other frescoes, such as the Bull Leaping Fresco, to pottery. The youth of the boys in the Akrotiri Boxer Fresco hints that athletes began training very early on in life, suggesting that sports were extremely important to Minoan society. It has even been suggested that athletics played a religious role in society due to their widespread practice. The youth of athletes in many pieces of artwork indicates that athletic competition may have been a rite of passage into adulthood for the Minoans. Although there is much scholarly debate as to whether or not the gloves that the boys are wearing were meant to provide protection for the bones of the wearer or increase the amount of damage inflicted on the opponent, it is clear that with the exception of gloves, jewelry, and belts, competitors wore as little as possible. Due to the simplicity of the sport, it is quite possible that boxing was created as a means to settle disputes and eventually evolved into an athletic competition.  How Frescoes are made  In order to achieve such vibrant coloration there are several techniques possible. In Buon Fresco- commonly known from renaissance art- a lime plaster was applied to the walls and then painted over while wet with colorful paint. In Minoan art, frescos often employed another technique as well known as Fresco Secco. After the plaster and paint dried, extra paint was sometimes used to add details, and would be applied with a binding agent. Some frescos are entirely created using this technique. The most common colors used in frescoes were green, blue, yellow, white, red, and black, all of which were derived from minerals and later fixed with organic material. Advanced geometric patterns suggest the usage of mechanical tools to improve the accuracy of the designs as well as a grid system for proportionality. As is common in other forms of Greek art such as pottery, male skin is generally painted red while females tend to be portrayed as white. In the Akrotiri Boxer Fresco, the youths' red skin suggest their gender while their partially shaved heads indicate that they are still children.

Set in the world of Butcher's contemporary fantasy/mystery novel series, The Dresden Files, War Cry takes place in the series' continuity, after the events of the novel Dead Beat. Plot A secret war is raging between the wizards of The White Council and the vampires of the Red Court. After attacks in Palermo, Sicily and the Congo decimate the ranks of the Wardens, the Council is desperate enough to promote Harry Dresden and place him in charge of a team of junior recruits on a secret mission to Iowa to extract a small group of mortal scholars who assist the Council. They reach the scholars just before night falls, forcing them to barricade their house against an army of vampires. Their initial assaults on the house are beaten off, but Harry knows that both time and numbers are on the enemy's side. Harry senses something wrong; if the vampires wanted the scholars dead, they could have destroyed the house from a distance. Eventually, one of the scholars admits that a Shoggoth is imprisoned in the cellar - a monstrous servant of the Old Ones that, among other things, wiped out the Akkadian civilization and devastated Hammurabi's capital of Babylon. Grimly, Harry recognizes the Shoggoth as a \\"supernatural weapon of mass destruction\\", that the vampires want to capture, despite the fantastic danger to the entire world. The vampires' next assault almost overwhelms the defenders, until Harry's half-brother Thomas Raith appears behind the vampires and kills several of them, before retreating inside the house. He warns Harry that his own clan, the White Court, has sent a force of human auxiliaries to assist the Red Court's leader, Baron Bravosa. This makes the situation even more serious, since the First Law of Magic forbids wizards from using lethal force against other humans. A mortal servant of the vampires (an ex-Green Beret) infiltrates the house and kills several of the scholars, opening a hole in the defense. Harry, who grimly reminds his proteges that he \\"plays to win,\\" releases the Shoggoth. The vampires hold it at bay with flamethrowers, and Harry sends the scholars to safety, escorted by the three junior Wardens. When the vampires' fuel runs out, Harry and Thomas lure the Shoggoth to a nearby quarry. Harry is attacked by Baron Bravosa, who taunts that Harry is no match for him, even if he weren't exhausted and badly wounded. Harry knows he doesn't have to be: a minor spell is enough to nudge Bravosa into the grip of the oncoming Shoggoth, and the vampire dies screaming in agony and begging for help. Once the monster is inside the quarry, Harry and Thomas plant and detonate explosives, destroying it. Leaderless, and deprived of their objective, the vampires retreat. Harry reunites with his team, and their elation at having survived and triumphed over the odds is tempered by the knowledge that only an extremely powerful wizard could have imprisoned the Shoggoth on the mortal plane, which means someone from the White Council, their own side, has not only violated the Laws of Magic, but sent them to protect it in the expectation that they would die. Elsewhere, a shadowy figure receives a phone call about the destruction of the Shoggoth, and comforts his caller by saying there are many other similar weapons they may use for their purposes.

It is focused on reducing social stigmas and ambiguity, by bringing attention to suicide statistically and sociologically, and encouraging positive dialogue and engagement as a means to prevent suicide. Suicide awareness is linked to suicide prevention as both address suicide education and the dissemination of information to ultimately decrease the rate of suicide. Awareness is a first stage that can ease the need for prevention. Awareness signifies a fundamental consciousness of the threat, while prevention focuses on stopping the act. Suicide awareness is not a medical engagement, but a combination of medical, social, emotional and financial counseling. Suicide awareness in adolescents focuses on the age group between 10‚Äì24 years, beginning with the onset of puberty.  Stigma and ambiguity  Stigma is a negative impact that society can often attribute to the suicidal condition, and which can hinder and prevent positive engagement with those demonstrating suicidal behavior. It can be experienced as self- stigma or cultural, public stigma. Self-stigma is the adverse effect of internalized prejudice, manifesting itself in reduced self-esteem, decreased self-efficacy, and a feeling of ‚Äúwhy try‚Äù or self-deprecation (undervaluing any attempts to get a job, be social, etc. because of lack of self-worth). It is experienced not only by those facing suicidal thoughts, but also by those directly and indirectly affected such as family members and friends. Public stigma is experienced by prejudice and discrimination through public misuse of stereotypes associated with suicide. Stigma can create a detrimental barrier for some seeking help. Research has consistently illustrated the physical link between suicide and mental illness, but ignorance and outdated beliefs can sometimes lead to these disorders being identified as a weakness or a lack of willpower. Stigma can prevent survivors of suicide attempts, and those affected by suicide deaths, from reaching out for support from professionals and advocates to make positive change.  Historical stigma  Historically, suicide has not always been considered a societal taboo.Lighthouse, ‚ÄúA Beacon of Hope,‚Äù (2012, June 4). The stigma of suicide. Retrieved from http://www.lighthousecharity.com/stigma-of-suicide/ It is critical to understand the historical context in order to raise awareness of suicide's impact on our current culture. Suicide was embraced as a philosophical escape by the followers of the Greek philosopher Epicurus when life's happiness seemed lost.Lighthouse, ‚ÄúA Beacon of Hope,‚Äù (2012, June 4) The stigma of suicide. Retrieved from http://www.lighthousecharity.com/stigma-of-suicide/ It has been glorified in self-immolation as an act of martyrdom as in the case of Thich Quang Duc who burned himself to death in protest of South Vietnam‚Äôs religious policy.Harding, J. (2016). Incendiary acts and apocryphal avant- gardes th√≠ch qu·∫£ng √∞·ª©c, self-Immolation, and buddhist spiritual vanguardism. Paj: A Journal of Performance & Art, 114, 31-51. Assisted suicide as a release from suffering can be traced back to ancient Roman society. In Jewish culture, there is a reverence for the mass suicide at masada in the face of attack by the Roman empire, showing how suicide has sometimes had a contradictory relationship with established religion. This indicates a tension between the presentation of suicide in this historical context, and its associations in our current society with personal anguish. Today, suicide is generally perceived as an act of despair or hopelessness, or a criminal act of terrorism (suicide attack). This negative backdrop was seen in Colonial America, where suicides were considered criminal and brought to trial, even if mental illness had been present. Suicide was identified in Roman Catholicism as a sinful act, with religious burial prohibited until 1983, when the Catholic Church altered the canon law to allow funerals and burials within the church of those who died by suicide. Today, many current societies and religious traditions condemn suicide, especially in Western culture. Public consideration of suicide in our culture is further complicated by society's struggle to rationalize such cult events as the Jonestown mass suicide.Fondakowski, L. (2013). Stories from jonestown. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. In light of these mixed historical messages, it can be confusing for youth, presented with an academic and historical profile for suicide. The ambiguity of accepted suicide and suicidal behavior definitions impedes progress with its utilization of variable terminology.  Public and cultural stigma  Today, even though suicide is considered a public health issue by advocates, the general public often still consider it a private shame; a final desperate solution for the emotionally weak.Rubin, B. M. (2015, January 18). Suicide attempt survivors come out of the shadows. Chicago Tribune. Retrieved from http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-suicide-attempt-survivors- met-20150118-story.html#page=1 It is stigmatized in the public perception by being associated with weakness, a ‚Äúcry for attention,‚Äù shame, and depression, without understanding the contributing factors. There can be a visceral and emotional reaction to suicide rather than an attempt to understand it. This reaction is based on stereotypes (overgeneralizations about a group: weak or crazy), prejudices (agreement with stereotypical beliefs and related emotional reactions: Sue attempted suicide; ‚ÄòI‚Äôm afraid of her‚Äô), and discrimination (unfair behavior towards the suicidal individual or group: avoidance; ‚Äòsuicidal persons should be locked up‚Äô). Erving Goffman defined courtesy stigma as the discrimination, prejudice and stereotypes which family and friends experience as suicide survivors. Public stigma is felt by medical professionals whose clients die by suicide and whose treatment is then questioned by colleagues and in lawsuits, often contributing to their being less inclined to work with suicidal patients. Property can also be stigmatized by suicide: property sellers in certain jurisdictions in the United States, in California for example, are required by law to reveal if a suicide or murder occurred on the premises in the past three years, putting suicide in the same category as homicide. These issues compound and perpetuate the public stigma of suicide, exacerbating the inclination for suicidal individuals, and their family and friends, to bury their experiences, creating a barrier to care.  Emotional stigma  Emotionally, the negative stigma of suicide is a powerful force creating isolation and exclusion for those in suicidal crisis.Scocco, P., Castriotta, C., Toffol, E., Preti, A. (2012). Stigma of suicide attempt (STOSA) scale and stigma of suicide and suicide survivor (STOSASS) scale: Two new assessment tools. Psychiatry Research, 200(2-3), 872-878. doi:10.1016/j.psychres.2012.06.033 The use of stereotypes, discrimination and prejudices can strip the dignity of those experiencing suicidal behavior. It also has the potential to inhibit compassion from others and to diminish hope.Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention. (2014, July). The way forward: Pathways to hope, recovery, and wellness with insights from lived experience, p. 17. Retrieved from http://actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/sites/actionallianceforsuicideprevention.org/files/The- Way-Forward-Final-2014-07-01.pdf Fear of being socially rejected and labeled suicidal can prevent communication and support. Distress and reduced life satisfaction are directly affected by subjective feelings of being devalued and marginalized. This develops into an internalized stigma; it creates self- stigmatized emotions, self-deprecation and self-actualization of negative stereotypes, causing further withdrawal, reduction in quality of life and the inhibiting access to care. This emotional stigma also affects suicide survivors: those suffering a loved one's loss, stirring up guilt, self-blame, isolation, depression and post-traumatic stress. Subjective experiences of feeling shunned or blamed for an incident can cause those close to the victim to bury the truth of what transpired. Awareness factors Suicide awareness expresses the need for open constructive dialogue as an initial step towards preventing incidents of adolescent suicide. Once the stigmas have been overcome, there is an increased possibility that education, medical care and support can provide a critical framework for those at risk. Lack of information, awareness of professional services, judgment and insensitivity from religious groups, and financial strain have all been identified as barriers to support access for those youth in suicidal crisis. The critical framework is a necessary component to implementing suicide awareness and suicide prevention, and breaking down these barriers. Protective factors Protective factors are characteristics or conditions that may have a positive effect on youth and reduce the possibility of suicide attempts. These factors have not been studied in as much depth as risk factors, so there is less research. They include: *Receiving effective mental health care. *Positive social connections and support with family and peers provides coping skills. *Participation in community and social groups (i.e. religious) that foster resilience. *Optimism enables youth to engage and acquire adaptive skills in reinterpreting adverse experiences to find meaning and benefit. *Life satisfaction, spiritual wellbeing and belief that a person can survive beyond their pain is protective against suicide. *Resiliency based on adaptive coping skills has can reduce suicide risk, and research suggests these skills can be taught. *Finding hope can be a key protective factor and a catalyst for the recovery process.National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention: Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force. (2014). The way forward: Pathways to hope, recovery, and wellness with insights from lived experience. Washington, DC: Author, p. 17. It is important to note, however, that in-depth training is paramount for those involved in any service that looks to the awareness and needs of those touched by suicide. Social media Suicide awareness and prevention have in the past only relied on research from clinical observation. In bringing insights, intimate experience, and real-world wisdom of suicide attempt survivors to the table, professionals, educators, other survivors and suicide attempt survivors can learn firsthand from their ‚Äúlived experience.‚ÄùNational Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention: Suicide Attempt Survivors Task Force.

Media and journalism, when reporting on suicide, have moved forward in their discussion of suicide. The Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide discovered the powerful impact media coverage, newspapers and journalists can have on the perpetuating stigma of suicide, and that it can lead to greater risk of occurrence. The specific rules that media representatives should follow are: * Don't sensationalize the suicide. * Don‚Äôt talk about the contents of the suicide note, if there is one. * Don't describe the suicide method. * Report on suicide as a public health issue. * Don‚Äôt speculate why the person might have done it. * Don‚Äôt quote or interview police or first responders about the causes of suicide. * Describe suicide as ‚Äúdied by suicide‚Äù or ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù or ‚Äúkilled themselves,‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcommitted suicide.‚Äù * Don‚Äôt glamorize suicide.Pirkis, J., Blood, R.

Health education is closely related to health awareness. School can be the best place to implement a suicide education program because it is the pivotal location that brings together the major influences in an adolescent's life. Pilot programs for awareness, and coping and resiliency training should be put into place for all adolescent school-aged children to combat life stressors and to encourage healthy communication.

In September 2017, he was nominated by President Donald Trump to fill a vacancy on the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. His nomination drew controversy due to his lack of judicial experience, partisan personal blogging, and failure to disclose that he was married to Ann Donaldson, the chief of staff to White House counsel Don McGahn. He became the third judicial nominee since 1989 to receive a unanimous rating of \\"not qualified\\" from the American Bar Association. On December 13, 2017, Talley withdrew his name from consideration for the appointment.  Early life  Talley earned his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy and history from the University of Alabama, and his Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School, where he served as an articles editor of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.  Career  Earlier in his career, he worked as an associate in the Washington, D.C., office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, served as law clerk to Judge Joel F. Dubina of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and served as a law clerk to Judge L. Scott Coogler of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Before joining the Department of Justice, he served for two years as Deputy Solicitor General under then-Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who endorsed his judicial nomination. Prior to joining the Alabama Attorney General's Office, Talley served as a speechwriter for Senator Rob Portman and as a senior writer for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.  Failed nomination to district court  On September 7, 2017, President Donald J. Trump nominated Talley to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, to the seat vacated by Judge Mark Fuller, who resigned on August 1, 2015. On October 17, 2017, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The ABA Standing Committee sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee dated November 7, 2017, stating that it believed Talley \\"did not have the requisite trial experience or its equivalent\\", but that it \\"had no questions about his integrity or temperament\\" and that with time and experience \\"Mr. Talley has great potential to serve as a federal judge.\\" The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights sent a letter dated November 8, 2017 to the Judiciary Committee stating that Talley \\"has demonstrated ideologically extreme views that call into question his temperament and ability to approach cases with the fairness and open-mindedness necessary to serve as a federal judge,\\" quoting tweets and blog posts and asking that Chairman Chuck Grassley \\"not break the Senate tradition of waiting to schedule nomination hearings until their ABA ratings have been submitted, for good reason ‚Äì so that the committee can have all the relevant information before it when questioning nominees for lifetime appointments to the judiciary.\\" On November 9, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee endorsed Talley for the lifetime appointment in an 11‚Äì9 party-line vote; Chairman Grassley, rejecting the ABA's \\"not qualified\\" opinion on Talley and fellow nominee Holly Teeter, wrote, \\"I‚Äôll be voting for both these nominees today.... I don‚Äôt see extensive trial experience as the sole factor in deciding whether a nominee is qualified.\\" On December 12, Grassley said that he had advised the Trump White House to \\"reconsider\\" the nominations of Talley and Jeff Mateer: \\"I would advise the White House not to proceed.\\" A spokesperson for Grassley said that the Senator \\"has been concerned about statements made by nominees Mateer and Talley, and he‚Äôs conveyed those concerns to the White House. Revelations of Talley‚Äôs statements surfaced only after he was reported out of the Judiciary Committee.\\" BuzzFeed News reported that Talley had offered to withdraw the previous week and that Alabama Senator Richard Shelby had asked Talley for his letter of withdrawal. On December 13 the White House confirmed that Talley and Mateer's nominations would not proceed. The nomination of Talley for a federal district court judgeship was noteworthy because Talley had never tried a case at the time of his nomination. Talley was unanimously rated \\"not qualified\\" by the American Bar Association's (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. At the time the rating was issued, the ABA had only on two other occasions since 1989 unanimously rated a judicial nominee as \\"not qualified\\". Talley's nomination was also unusual because of his lack of experience (at the time of the nomination, he had practiced law for three years) and because he \\"displayed a degree of partisanship unusual for a judicial nominee\\" on his blog, in 2016 denouncing Hillary Clinton as \\"Hillary Rotten Clinton\\" and in 2013, after the Obama administration announced plans and proposals to address gun violence following the December 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, expressing support for the National Rifle Association.Two days after Dianne Feinstein introduced the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, Talley wrote on his blog, \\"the President and his democratic allies in Congress are about to launch the greatest attack on our constitutional freedoms in our lifetime.... In the President‚Äôs mind, and in the mind [sic] of liberals in Congress, there is no such thing as a good gun, and there is no such thing as a good gun owner.... They [the NRA] stand for all of us now, and I pray that in the coming battle for our rights, they will be victorious.\\" In February 2013 on his blog, Talley said that he \\"agree[d] completely with\\" a reader's \\"thoughtful response\\" which stated, \\"We will have to resort to arms when our other rights ‚Äî of speech, press, assembly, representative government ‚Äî fail to yield the desired results.\\" While awaiting Senate confirmation, Talley failed to disclose that he was married to Ann Donaldson, the chief of staff to White House counsel Don McGahn. As part of his Senate confirmation, Talley was asked to identify family members and others who are \\"likely to present potential conflicts of interest,\\" but he did not identify his wife. Talley also did not mention his wife when describing his contact with lawyers for the White House. She is a witness in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Vanzetta Penn McPherson, a former magistrate judge for the Middle District, wrote an opinion editorial calling Talley unqualified for the position. On December 13, 2017, a White House official said that Talley had withdrawn his name from consideration. On January 3, 2018, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the United States Senate.\\"Congressional Record\\", United States Senate, January 3, 2018 On January 5, 2018, the White House renominated 21 of 26 federal judicial nominees who had been returned by the U.S. Senate. Talley was not among the 21 individuals who were renominated.  Writings  Talley has published three horror novels/novellas and two \\"true ghost stories\\"; in 2011, Talley's Lovecraftian horror novel That Which Should Not Be was a finalist for the Bram Stoker Award. Talley was part of The Tuscaloosa Paranormal Research Group, which investigated claims of paranormal phenomenon such as ghosts. With TPRG co-founder David Higdon he wrote the book Haunted Tuscaloosa about the group's investigations.  Personal life  On August 15, 2015, Talley married Ann Michelle Donaldson, also a Harvard Law School graduate, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

History The original Stanmore church, located on Old Church Lane, was consecrated in the name of St. Mary. It remained the village church until 1632, when it was replaced, and thereafter fell into ruin and was taken down. As of the late twentieth century, a single tomb survived in the back garden of a local house.

Gilbert and the Prime Minister George Hamilton-Gordon, the Earl of Aberdeen. The present church is built of Kentish rag and Bath stone, and was designed in an Early Decorated Gothic style by the Surrey architect Henry Clutton. It was built by the Lambeth builder George Myers.

The Portage Escarpment is a major landform in the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York which marks the boundary between the Till Plains to the north and west and the Appalachian Plateau to the east and south. The escarpment is the defining geological feature of New York's Finger Lakes region. Its proximity to Lake Erie creates a narrow but easily traveled route between upstate New York and the Midwest. Extensive industrial and residential development occurred along this route. General description The Portage Escarpment forms the northern and western boundary between the Appalachian Plateau and the Till Plains of the Central Lowland physiographic section of the United States. The escarpment begins in eastern New York. Nevin Fenneman placed its starting point between Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake, where the Onondaga Escarpment transitions to the sandstone of the Portage Escarpment. But New York state officials concluded that it began east of Auburn, New York. As it approaches Buffalo, New York, it turns to the southwest and hugs the shore of Lake Erie. The escarpment moves across northwest Pennsylvania, continuing close to the shoreline. In Ohio, the escarpment gradually moves further away from shore. At Cleveland, Ohio, it turns sharply southward. It proceeds in an undulating south-southwest direction across Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In these latter two states it is known as the Highland Rim. The landform's name is derived from attempts by the French to establish a portage over the escarpment in the 1750s which would link their Great Lakes forts with their fort at Pittsburgh. New York The Portage Escarpment (heavy black line) as it weaves through Ontario and Yates Counties in New York. In New York state, the Portage Escarpment (also known as the \\"Finger Lakes sedimentary deposit\\") consists of sandstone interbedded with shale. The base is almost all black and gray soft shale, while the upper portion is interbedded sandstone and shale. Because the more durable sandstone is not a capstone, the escarpment does not have a sharp, defined cliff or crest. This geologic makeup gives it a slope instead, and it often appears as two or more parallel terraces. The Portage Escarpment's eastern end is in the Finger Lakes region, where it is the dominant topographic feature. Prior to the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age), roughly 24 major rivers flowed north over the escarpment. The Wisconsin glaciation began about 85,000 years ago, and the ice reached its southernmost point approximately 25,000‚Äì21,000 years ago during the last glacial maximum. The ice sheet could not overcome the Portage Escarpment. Instead, the ice scoured downward, creating 11 long gouges in the earth. When the ice age ended about 10,000 years ago, these gouges filled with water coming down the escarpment and became the 11 Finger Lakes. The Portage Escarpment essentially runs along the northernmost tips of each finger lake. The glacial gouging and subsequent erosion by rivers and streams has led to the creation of deep valleys which extend southward as far as the southern tip of the Finger Lakes. This makes the escarpment appear to weave north and south in deep loops. The Wisconsin glaciation's scouring of the land in front of the escarpment in the Finger Lakes area has left the escarpment with a steeper slope than elsewhere in New York state. Here, the escarpment can be in height. West of the Finger Lakes region, the Portage Escarpment is relatively straight. The interbedded sandstone and shale here has suffered extensive erosion. In Livingston County, New York, this has left it much less well-defined. The Tonawanda Plain lies along the north side of the escarpment from its eastern terminus to Lake Erie. This lacustrine plain is bounded on the north by the Niagara Escarpment. Although quite wide at the eastern end of Lake Erie, the plain narrows considerably along the lake's southern shore. Here, the plain continues to be bounded by the Portage Escarpment, which turns southwest in a series of indefinite hills at Hamburg, Orchard Park, and East Aurora. Pennsylvania The Portage Escarpment continues to hug the southern shoreline of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania. It passes solely through Erie County, where it is from the lake. Here, Mississippian sandstone predominates over shale, and the escarpment rises to between in height. From Erie, Pennsylvania, to Cleveland, the escarpment is a little further from the shore, about . Ohio Standing atop the Portage Escarpment at about E. 110th Street, looking west down Woodland Avenue in Cleveland. The Portage Escarpment also largely controlled where the Wisconsin glaciation stopped in Ohio. The lacustrine Erie Plain lies beyond it to the northwest and west. The escarpment continues to hug Lake Erie until it reaches Cleveland. In this portion, the escarpment rises in three distinct terraces: A first terrace, which is about above the plain; a second terrace, about higher than the first terrace; and a third terrace, about higher than the second terrace. In total, it ranges from in height, and is wide, giving it a slope of per . East of Cleveland, much of the lower portions of the escarpment are covered in glacial moraine. Both the upper and lower parts are cut by numerous dry ravines, rivers, and streams. This makes the escarpment somewhat discontinuous. The upper terrace of the escarpment is difficult to distinguish from the Appalachian Plateau beyond, because both are eroded so deeply by water. Where the escarpment meets the Erie Plain, it is much more well- defined. Where the escarpment meets the valley of the Cuyahoga River, it bends southward and begins moving even further away from the shore. It is distant from the shore between the Cuyahoga River and the Rocky River, and distant from the shore west of the Rocky River. Here, the escarpment rises between in a single step. The much lower height of the escarpment has allowed glacial till to build up and cover much of the escarpment's topography. This part of the escarpment is extremely discontinuous, as it is broken by the broad river valleys of the Great Miami and Scioto rivers. Cultural and historic importance That portion of the Erie Plain between Lake Erie and the Portage Escarpment connects the Central Lowland of the Midwest with the Mohawk Valley in the east, and provides the only natural, low-lying route north of the Gulf Coast to the North American interior from the Atlantic seaboard. Consequently, this area is heavily populated. Settlement of Ohio largely occurred along the Erie Plain, following the natural route created adjacent to the Portage Escarpment barrier.

History Born Isaac Veyret (or Vereil) in 1653, Mathurin Desmaretz was first recorded as one of the leaders of a group of French flibustiers (buccaneers) in 1685. He joined with Edward Davis, Francois Grogniet, Pierre le Picard, and others hoping to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet off Panama. They engaged the fleet that May but were outgunned and outmaneuvered and left with little to show for their efforts. The combined group split up to raid separately, with most of the French contingent following Groginet. In early 1688 he was quartermaster to Jean Charpin aboard a ship supplied by retired fellow buccaneer Laurens de Graaf. They joined forces with Jean- Baptiste du Casse in early 1689, raiding off Cape Verde before returning to the Caribbean to attack Dutch colonies at Surinam and Berbice. When war broke out against England they assaulted St. Christopher; while leading ground troops their ship was stolen by mutinous English crewmen, led by William Kidd and Robert Culliford. The buccaneers under du Casse broke up in September; Charpin had been replaced by Jean Fantin, who took a brigantine and some of the French troops. Desmarestz purchased a fluyt called La Machine with the help of Charles de Courbon, comte de Bl√©nac (Governor of Martinique) and was elected Captain. He captured a few small ships in late 1689, putting into Guadeloupe in early 1690 to repair and refit, where the impoverished locals were happy to trade for Desmarestz‚Äô food and supplies. He returned to Martinique where he met pirate Etienne de Montauban, who left with him when they sailed in June. Bl√©nac was asked to have Desmarestz‚Äô buccaneers return to now-French St. Christopher to help defend it but refused to ask them. In August he captured a treasure-laden 24-gun Spanish frigate from Trinidad, keeping it for his own and renaming it Le Ballestrelle, and giving La Machine to Montauban. They harassed three East India ships before Bl√©nac returned to France. Desmarestz sailed again to Martinique in August 1691 to refit and obtain a new commission before sailing toward western Africa, hoping eventually to raid off the Red Sea. After capturing English and Dutch vessels on the way he stopped in the Azores to resupply, where local French officials interceded to protect him from angry Dutchmen and Englishmen. Desmarestz conducted raids off Gambia and Sierra Leone through summer 1692. By late 1694 Desmarestz was in the Indian Ocean , putting into Rajapur with the rickety and leaking La Ballestrelle. He purchased a grab to use as a tender and repair ship, sailing to Moh√©li in the Comoros Islands. He tried to return to Martinique in early 1696 but his ship foundered and was smashed just offshore. He tried to send the grab to Anjouan (modern Johanna) but Henry Every captured it. Every warned other English captains in the area about desperate armed Frenchmen on Moh√©li who were looking for a ship to steal, but he eventually took 52 of them on board his own ship Fancy. Other members of Desmarestz‚Äô crew were given to Mughal authorities when they became furious over Every‚Äôs capture of the pilgrim treasure ship Gunsway. Still others were found by a French warship squadron, who refused to help them and burned the ship they‚Äôd been building to escape Moh√©li. Ironically William Kidd picked up a few more later in 1697 off Anjouan when his own crew was decimated by sickness. Finally in December 1696 Desmarestz struggled to Reunion Island with a barely-seaworthy vessel and a few sick men. French officials knew he was a pirate but took him in when they saw his pathetic condition. He settled there, marrying a local woman and starting a family in 1697, and is believed to have died by 1700.

According to the story, Agamemnon committed a mistake and had to sacrifice Iphigenia to Artemis to appease her. There are different versions of the story. According to one side of the story, before Agamemnon could sacrifice her, Artemis saved her and replaced her with a deer on the altar. In the other version, Agamemnon actually went through with the sacrifice. The different versions aid in the different depictions of Iphigenia. The sacrifice of Iphigenia is immortalized on many different mediums. Vases are a common base for the story, but there are mosaics, paintings, and written works from every era illustrating the myth of Iphigenia. The most common scene depicted in the different visual media of Iphigenia is when she about to be offered up to Artemis on the altar.  Descriptions of the sacrifice by Pausanias  Paisanias was a traveler who wrote the Description of Greece which depicted his accounts of what he has seen on mainland Greece. He recorded a few depictions of the death of Iphigenia. He mentions that the temple of Artemis was where the sacrifice was to take place. He goes on to describe the temple of Artemis after its destruction. Pausanias then gives an example of an artistic depiction of Iphigenia that was found in Catalonia. In the mosaic, Iphigenia is being led to the altar and it is seen that Artemis is in the back waiting and holding a deer to replace Iphigenia with.  Iphigenia in Art   Volute Krater of the Sacrifice  thumb Volute Krater of Iphigenia's Sacrifice 185x185px There are several vases that were made and decorated with illustrations of the sacrifice of Iphigenia. The volute krater shown was made in Apulia around 370 BC-350 BC. It is in the red-figure technique. Here the sacrifice is about to take place, with the altar depicted in white. Agamemnon is also painted here with a knife in his hand, showing that he about to commit the sacrifice. Artemis and Apollo are also illustrated. Artemis is looking down upon Iphigenia and Apollo is seated on a rock to the left, looking back. Death is imminent because the offering is going to be made with an audience around.  Mosaic of Iphigenia  thumb A mosaic depicting Iphigenia 153x153px Recently, a mosaic depicting Iphigenia was found in Perge, Turkey during an excavation by archeologists. It is said to be about 1,800 years old. The mosaic shows Iphigenia during the Trojan War. It was concluded that the site was a cult area founded in the basement of a shop that could have existed during the days of Ancient Greece. In this depiction, Iphigenia is replaced by a deer, harrowingly missing death.  Iphigenia in Aulis  Iphigenia in Aulis is a play written by a Greek playwright Euripides. It revolves around Agamemnon's decision to sacrifice his daughter's life for Artemis. It is written through the eyes of Agamemnon. Death is a main theme in this play because of the Iphigenia's circumstance, but also because the Trojan war is on the cusp.  Iphigenia in Tauris  Iphigenia in Tauris is another play written by Euripides. In this telling of the tale, Iphigenia is not dead, and she meets with her brother. She is made a priestess in the temple of Artemis of the Taurians She recounts her story and tells how she arrived to the place by the hands of Artemis. Iphigenia conducts rites as a priestess to Artemis.

In September 2017, he was nominated by President Donald Trump to become a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas; however, the nomination was withdrawn in December 2017. Mateer previously served as general counsel of the First Liberty Institute, a religious liberty advocacy group headquartered in Plano. He is returning to the Institute, following his resignation from the Attorney General's Office.  Biography  Mateer earned his Bachelor of Arts with honors from Dickinson College and his Juris Doctor with honors from the Dedman School of Law. He spent nearly 20 years litigating in private practice, where he handled a range of trial and appellate matters. He then became general counsel and executive vice president of the First Liberty Institute. In two 2015 speeches, he described the issue of transgender children as a deception and \\"part of Satan's plan\\". He also spoke in opposition to state bans on conversion therapy at a conference hosted by Kevin Swanson, a pastor who preaches that the Biblical punishment for homosexuality is death. Mateer said that the legalization of same-sex marriage could lead to the legalization of polygamy and bestiality. Mateer most recently served as the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas under Attorney General Ken Paxton, supervising the state's active litigation matters. He recently resigned and filed a complaint against AG Paxton alleging wrongdoing along with other top attorneys in the litigation division.  Failed nomination to District Court  On September 7, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Mateer to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, to the seat vacated by Judge Richard A. Schell, who assumed senior status on March 10, 2015. Mateer was recommended to the White House by Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. After Mateer's remarks about transgender children being part of \\"Satan's plan\\" and his support for conversion therapy were publicized in late September 2017, John Cornyn, the senior Republican Senator from Texas and then- Senate Majority Whip, expressed skepticism about Mateer's suitability to sit on the federal bench. Cornyn and members of a committee that screens Texas judicial candidates said that Mateer had not disclosed the statements. Cruz said that he still supported Mateer's nomination. In December 2017, Mateer's nomination for the federal judiciary was withdrawn.

The elected Speaker of the House of Commons was Sir John Finch, the Member of Parliament for Canterbury. Following the debacle of the previous Parliament, when Parliament had refused the grant the King funds until their concerns about his favourite, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, had been addressed, it had proved difficult to prosecute the war with Spain. When Charles‚Äôs uncle, Christian IV of Denmark, was soundly defeated by Imperial forces at Lutter in August 1626 Charles needed funds urgently to go to Christian's aid. He therefore decided to bypass Parliament by levying a Forced Loan, which actually raised more money, some ¬£243,000, than Parliament had been prepared to give him in exchange for Buckingham's impeachment. In the event the money raised by the levy, the raising of which so alienated Parliament and its supporters, was spent on preparing to wage war on France after relations with that hitherto friendly country had deteriorated. When the Duke of Buckingham wanted to take a fleet to raise the siege at La Rochelle and was prevented by financial restraints, Charles reluctantly accepted the need to call this 3rd Parliament. Once assembled, the Commons indicated that it would vote the King five subsidies in return for his acceptance of a Petition of Right, confirming the rights of the individual as against the divine right of the King. After much debate, prevarication and delay, the King finally backed down and gave his assent to the petition in such a way it could be considered law. The Subsidy Bill passed through its final stage in the House of Lords by 17 June 1628. Parliament then turned its attention to tonnage and poundage, two onerous taxes on which the King was dependent and which Parliament considered illegal. The King brought the session to a rapid close. Over the summer the fleet to relieve La Rochelle was assembled, but the commander Buckingham was murdered by a disgruntled army officer. The fleet nevertheless sailed under a new commander but achieved little success. When Parliament reconvened in January 1629 it returned to the issue of tonnage and poundage, claiming that its continued imposition contradicted the Petition of Right. Matters got so heated that Charles dissolved Parliament by proclamation on 2 March 1629 and had nine of the leading protagonists arrested, one of whom, Sir John Eliot, would die in the Tower of London three years later. Charles then dissolved Parliament in person on the 10 March and was so disillusioned that he did not recall it again until 1640.

His father, Toni Sugiarto, was a police Brigadier General and member of the People's Representative Council until his death in 1997. His mother, Melinda Susilarini, is a former beauty pageant contestant whose father was the caretaker of Cipanas Palace. Arya married Yane Ardian in 2002. They have two children: a son and a daughter. Career Following the May 1998 fall of Suharto, Arya became one of the founders of the National Mandate Party (Indonesian: Partai Amanat Nasional or PAN). Between 1998 and 2001, he was a politics lecturer at Parahyangan Catholic University. Afterwards, he moved to Paramadina University, where he still lectures. He was also as a political observer, although he resigned from active position in 2010 due to conflict of interest with his career in PAN. As mayor He ran in Bogor's 2013 mayoral election with Usmar Hariman as deputy, receiving 132,835 votes (33.1%) with the runner-up Ahmad-Aim pair receiving 131,080 (32.7%).

In 1855, Anderson was elected to the so-called \\"Bogus Legislature\\", the first Kansas territorial legislature, from the 6th district, so named because of its disproportionate number of pro-slavery legislators over Free Staters. Known as Border Ruffians, several thousand men relocated from Missouri to Kansas in order to elect pro-slavery candidates; Anderson was among them although he retained his main residence in Lexington while officially residing in Fort Scott. He was elected Speaker Pro Tempore of the legislature. Anderson was a staunch supporter of slavery, and was the architect of several pro-slavery laws during the territory's existence. During the Kansas Border War, Anderson worked as a lawyer in Kansas. He was a founder of the \\"Law and Order Party\\" in Leavenworth in October 1855. During the American Civil War in 1862, Joseph and William Anderson and their father were arrested and imprisoned \\"for refusing to sign an 'oath of allegiance' to the Union.\\" Following their release, they moved back to Kentucky and Joseph continued as a lawyer.

ParsellPipher v. Parsell, 930 A.2d 890 (Del. 2007) is a case that was decided before the Supreme Court of Delaware. It shows that a minor can be held to an adult standard of care when engaging in inherently dangerous activities such as driving.  Facts  Three 16-year-olds were driving in a truck, all seated in the front seat: One boy (Parsell) driving and two girls, one in the middle seat and one next to the passenger side door. A passenger, the girl next to the door (Beisel), grabbed the steering wheel as if intending to make a car crash, at which all the occupants of laughed. A few minutes later the same girl grabbed the steering wheel again, this time actually causing an accident. The girl in the middle (Pipher), suffered damages and sued the driver. \\"As they were traveling at 55 mph, Beisel unexpectedly \\"grabbed the steering wheel causing the truck to veer off onto the shoulder of the road.\\" Parsell testified that Beisel's conduct caused him both shock and surprise. Although Beisel's conduct prompted him to be on his guard, Parsell further testified that he did not expect Beisel to grab the wheel again. Nevertheless, his recognition of how serious Beisel's conduct was, shows he was aware that he now had someone in his car who had engaged in dangerous behavior.\\" Parsell testified that he did nothing in response to Beisel's initial action. Approximately thirty seconds later, Beisel again yanked the steering wheel, causing Parsell's truck to leave the roadway, slide down an embankment and strike a tree. Pipher was injured as a result of the collision.\\"  Holding  In an opinion written by Justice Holland, the court held that the plaintiff's evidence should have been submitted to the jury because it was possible that the accident was foreseeable. \\"In general, where the actions of a passenger that cause an accident are not foreseeable, there is no negligence attributable to the driver. But, when actions of a passenger that interfere with the driver's safe operation of the motor vehicle are foreseeable, the failure to prevent such conduct may be a breach of the driver's duty to either other passengers or to the public. Under the circumstances of this case, a reasonable jury could find that Parsell breached his duty to protect Pipher from Beisel by preventing Beisel from grabbing the steering wheel a second time.\\" The case was reversed and remanded.

Biography Abu Said Uthman I succeeded his father Abu Yahya Yaghmurasen ibn Zayyan (1236‚Äì1282) as ruler of the Zayyanid dynasty. He was the pearl of perfection, lord of (diverse) fractions of the Abd el-Wad family. He was the bravest and one of the most fearsome warriors of his tribe Abou Zakarya Yah'ya Ibn Khaldoun Trad. Alfred Bel, Histoire des beni 'Abd El-Wad rois de Tlemcen jusqu'au r√®gne d'Abou Hammou Moussa II, Alger, Imprimerie orientale Pierre Fonatana, 1904 p. 158 He annexed to his empire the countries of his enemies and defended the lands of his subjects. His empire was luxurious and the cities were said to have been well administrated. Through marriages with the Hafsids, he was able to establish good relations with his eastern neighbors. This allowed Uthman I to withstand the ongoing attacks of the Marinids of Fez. The fighting led to devastating results in his Empire. The siege of Tlemcen by the Marinids was maintained from 1299 to 1307 during which the Marinids built the siege city of al-Mansura, which was at times even residence of the Marinid rulers. Despite the superiority of the Marinids, the Zayyanids were able to assert themselves, showing the support the dynasty had by the population of the empire. Uthman I did not live to see the end of the siege. Only under his successor Abu Zayyan I Muhammad (1303-1308) did the Marinids withdraw back to Al-Maghrib (al-Aqsa) after the death of their Sultan and as dynastic infighting broke out there. Expeditions Uthman I was a warrior, he took part in many sieges and battles consolidating his power within his empire and against his rivals (mainly the Marinids). *In 1287 he took the city of M√¢zo√ªna (located on the right bank of theChelif River from the Maghrawa and laid siege to the city of Taferdjint (no longer an existing city, possibly on the left bank of the Chelif River in the country of the Toudjin). *In 1290‚Äì91, the King of Tlemcen launched another expedition against the Toudjin. He victoriously marched through their country as he took control of the W√¢ncharis mountain, their refuge. Uthman I took the women and son of Mohammed Ibn‚ÄòAbd el-Qawi as prisoners but then sends them back to their domiciles. * During May 1289, Abou Sa'id took the city of T√©n√®s from the Maghrawas and from the Toudjin the city of M√©d√©a.Ibn Khaldoun (trad. William Mac Guckin de Slane), Histoire des Berb√®res et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique septentrionale, vol. I, Alger, Imprimerie du Gouvernement, 1852, p132,p371 * The Marinid Sultan Abou Ya‚Äòqo√ªb ben‚ÄòAbd el H‚Äôaqq marched against Tlemcen and camps not too far from the city Tuesday on 25 July 1290. On 27 September he returns to his capital after fierce combat and memorable attacks. *During the 18th of the following month (August) of the same year, Abou Sa'id attacked the Maghrawas that had established relations with the Marinid ruler during the siege, he conquered their country and forced them to obeisance, leaving his son Abu Hammu I in command of the city of Chelif. Uthman I then returns to Tlemcen. * On 28 April 1291, the Sultan marches against the Toudjin yet again, he kills their king and devastates their country. Then goes back to his capital. *In 1293‚Äì94 Abou Sa'id takes the city of Brechk located 19 miles west from Cherchell and 8 miles East of T√©n√®s from Tsabit ben Mandil of the Maghrawa after 40 days of siege. Tasbit manages to flee to Al-Maghreb (al-Aqsa)by sea. *During 1295‚Äì96, the Marinid Sultan marches against Tlemcen for the second time. He camps under the walls of Nedroma, then heads to mount Djidara (near Oran) then finally goes back to his kingdom. *In the same year the Sultan of Tlemcen launches an expedition against the Arabs and camps at Ma Taghalin and mount Ha'nach ( possibly near Constantine) not far from the Sahara and kicks the Arabs from the region.Abou Zakarya Yah'ya Ibn Khaldoun Trad.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

Main characters Mr. Pickles Mr. Pickles (voiced by Dave Stewart in the Season 3 Finale) is the titular protagonist and the Goodman family's pet Border Collie, revealed in the Season 3 finale to be descended from a long bloodline of dogs that are physical embodiment of the Devil that ruled over an ancient island nation that previously sacrificed any living dogs. Through reasons unknown, Mr. Pickles ended up in Old Town and living with the Goodman family - named by Tommy for his love of eating pickles. He also enjoys mutilating, killing and engaging in sexual debauchery with those who pose a threat to Tommy or other protagonists. Mr. Pickles is highly intelligent and possesses incredible strength, surgical skills that he uses to mutilate his victims, the ability to steal from an evil scientist, a high-tech android, and demonic powers which allow him to control local animals to do his bidding (it is shown in one episode of Season 3 that he can't control snakes due to them having no ears to hear his demonic commands but learns to control them through vibrations). Despite his evil ways, he loves and is extremely protective of the impressionable young Tommy and his family: protecting them from danger, and often killing those who might do them harm, such as murdering a group of pedophiles or turning an unlicensed breast surgeon who gave Tommy breast implants into a multiple-breasted freak. He has a long-standing feud with Henry Gobbleblobber, the only Goodman family member aware of Mr. Pickles' evil nature. While Mr. Pickles does not actually harm Henry, the dog does put the old man in humiliating situations while making him seem crazy to everyone else. Despite their adversarial nature, Mr. Pickles has saved Henry from being lobotomized while he was committed to an asylum and a cannibalistic serial killer that Henry had befriended, unaware he was an escaped convict and serial killer. Mr. Pickles has also shown to be sexually attracted to Tommy's mother by often groping, touching her private areas, and even playfully dry-humping her. Mr. Pickles' doghouse leads to a hidden, underground lair that's filled with blood, pentagrams, victims ‚Äì both living slaves and dead, mutilated bodies ‚Äì and a throne where he usually eats his pickles. Many of the series' one-time characters usually end up in his lair where they are either killed or kept as prisoners. Henry is the only person shown to be able to enter Mr. Pickles' lair and survive repeatedly as nobody believes him due to his tales. He is responsible for turning Henry's wife Agnes into Steve, which is implied to have been due to her promising to do anything he wanted her to. Mr. Pickles and Agnes work together to stop Henry from revealing the truth by having Agnes pretend she has amnesia, but their plan hits a snag when Henry takes her to a memory download service which is actually a blackmailing scam run by a group of hackers. Agnes angers Mr. Pickles when she almost blows everything while being confronted by her daughter and Henry over her failed attempt to seduce Stanley into having an affair which had been revealed by Tommy. She is killed by a passing truck but Mr. Pickles revives her and sends her on one last mission to destroy the satellite which contains a backup file of her memories. Though it is implied that Agnes became Steve because Mr. Pickles threatened to kill her, Mr. Pickles sheds a tear as he shoots Steve into space, indicating that he did come to care for her. He also works well with Beverly when Stanley and his coworkers are kidnapped and ends up saving her, Stanley, and his coworkers from their captors showing that he is just as protective of Tommy's parents. In the Season 3 Finale, Mr. Pickles chases Henry down to his cabin after he moves away, intending to lessen his credibility further by making it seem he can talk via a speaker for one of his spare Steves to speak through. But Mr. Pickles decides to frame Henry for mass murder instead after the old man attempted to kill him, with Henry escaping the Sheriff and finding Mr. Pickles's ancestral home where he and one of Mr. Pickles's servant conduct a scheme to kill him. Though Mr. Pickles appeared to outwit and seemingly killed Henry by switching bodies with the owner of a show dog he was making love with, he ends up being killed for real as Henry used the same spell to switch bodies with Mr. Pickles's servant and then the show dog. However, the show dog gives birth to a female puppy that Tommy names \\"Mrs. Pickles\\". Tommy Goodman Tommy Goodman (voiced by Kaitlyn Robrock) is the Goodman family's physically disabled young son. He is 6-year-old, wears leg-braces and considers Mr. Pickles as his best friend, often feeding him pickles whenever he behaves. Tommy is often protected by Mr. Pickles and is protective of Mr. Pickles as well, such as when he took it upon himself to search for Mr. Pickles after he was kidnapped by mercenaries. Due to his na√Øve personality, Tommy usually gets involved in dangerous situations and Mr. Pickles (at times frustrated) steps in to save him and dispose of the bad people involved. Like most characters on the show, Tommy is unaware of Mr. Pickles' evil nature. At one point in season two, Mr. Pickles spends most of the episode away from Tommy; this results in Tommy getting involved in a series of accidents, causing him to scorn Mr. Pickles and not give him a pickle. However, in Season 3's opening, he returns to his friendly nature after finding his grandmother Agnes. Agnes, however, shows contempt for Tommy, calling him a stupid boy even while pretending to be amnesiac. Stanley Goodman Stanley Goodman (voiced by Jay Johnston) is Tommy's father who works as a telemarketer. Stanley is constantly bullied by his boss; as a result, Stanley hardly has time to spend with his family, especially his son. Nevertheless, Stanley means well and is committed to his family. Though they don't interact much, Mr. Pickles seems to respect him to a degree. He even showed displeasure when it looked as though a doctor was about to bring Stanley harm. In the opening of Season 3, it is revealed that he once laid naked with his mother-in-law Agnes, which is revealed by Tommy when he had all the town's memories uploaded into his mind. However, Agnes reveals that he refused to have sex with her when she tried to seduce him. In Momma Named Me Sheriff, he quits his job as a telemarketer and became deputy where he works under the Sheriff. Beverly Goodman Beverly Goodman (voiced by Brooke Shields) is Tommy's stay-at-home mother who is the traditional dutiful mother and wife. Beverly is oblivious of Mr. Pickles' evil nature and dismisses the dog's sexual behavior, for instance groping and touching her, as simple dog mannerisms. Like her son, Beverly is very na√Øve and sometimes feels limited by her home life. Despite being the first person to dismiss her father's stories about Mr. Pickles, she is very close to him as he is one of the few people she can talk to. Near the end of the second season, she's shown to be very tired of her domestic duties and had a strained relationship with her mother, who prevented Beverley from following her dreams. In Season 3, she returns to her normal self after Agnes is found by Tommy unaware it was to prevent her father from revealing that Agnes was Steven. She hopes to reconnect with her mother despite believing she has amnesia. When it is revealed that Agnes had lied naked next to her husband, she is angered at Stanley and her mother, though Agnes reveals in anger that Stanley refused her attempts to seduce him before she is killed by a passing truck. However Agnes' death seems to give her some closure thanks to the knowledge that Stanley chose to remain faithful to her and their marriage. She and Stanley decide to tell Tommy that his grandmother is in a better place as he is unaware of her death. In Season 3 she is shown to be more assertive and capable, even working together with Mr. Pickles to rescue her husband when he is kidnapped together with his coworkers by an insane telemarketer-hating plantation owner. She is also capable of constructing a motorcycle from household items and even fight off a motorcycle gang all by herself. However, she has a habit of damaging her husband's trunk every time she drives even when she does not drive the truck itself, as she ends up damaging it with her makeshift motorcycle after it is hit by a bowling ball thrown by the Sheriff. However, she retains her kind-hearted personality when she refuses to punish Tommy's bullies physically as she doesn't condone corporal punishment or violence against children. Henry Gobbleblobber Henry Gobbleblobber (voiced by Frank Collison) is Tommy's grandfather and Beverly Goodman's father, referred to by everyone as \\"Grandpa Goodman\\" (despite the fact that he is really Beverly's father, while he and Stanley are in-laws), while . He is the only family member aware of Mr. Pickles' evil ways and has borne witness to the dog's several murders and other depraved acts. However, most of his family and the town Sheriff dismiss his attempts to expose the dog as just another of one of his \\"evil Mr. Pickles stories\\" and sometimes the Sheriff arrests him instead. Henry views Mr. Pickles as a monster though he understands that he and Mr. Pickles both care for Tommy's safety. Henry also suffers harassment from Mr. Pickles, though he briefly got peace from the dog during his brief fear of vacuum cleaners. At the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2, Henry attempts to expose Mr. Pickles by video-taping the inside of Mr. Pickles' doghouse to show to the Sheriff before learning he was one of Mr. Pickles' many high-tech androids. Henry ends being committed to the Old Town asylum when he attacked the real sheriff, realizing Mr. Pickles can't touch him while learning too late that asylum's director wishes to lobotomize him. Mr. Pickles eventually manages to free Henry from the asylum, ironically saving him. In the Season 2 finale and Season 3, Henry's attempt to find out about a strange coin associated with Mr. Pickles led to him learning that his wife Agnes, who is revealed to be Steve, is still alive and serves by Mr. Pickles' side. Henry threatens to expose them, but Mr. Pickles arranges Agnes to found while feigning amnesia, Henry takes her to a memory download service in an attempt to forcefully recover her memories before it backfired when the proprietor is revealed to be a blackmailing hacker. Following Agnes's death when she was run over by a truck after learning she lied naked with his son- in-law, Henry angrily tries to confront Mr. Pickles before finding her revived and made some peace with Agnes as she sacrifices herself to destroy the satellite containing the hacker's memory backups. In the Season 3 finale and Season 4, Henry grows tired of Mr. Pickles' continued torment and moves out of Old Town to a mountainside cabin while promising to visit the Goodman Family. Henry expected Mr. Pickles would come after him and lays a trap for him so he can kill the dog. But Mr. Pickles tricks Henry into believing he can speak while revising his original plan of further discrediting the old man to instead frame him as a mass murderer, with Henry on the lam with Sheriff following him to Mexico. Henry takes Sheriff's gun and forces him to take him to Mr. Pickles's ancestral island home, gaining an accomplice in one of Mr. Pickles's followers as they scheme to snipe the dog. Though it seemed Mr. Pickles was step away and killed him while setting up another to take the mass murder charges, Henry swapped souls with his accomplice prior to escape his death and then transferred his soul into a show dog Mr. Pickles was making out with to kill him. But Henry's victory is short-lived when Miss Pickles is born. In Momma Named Me Sheriff, Henry is shown to be annoyed by Mrs. Pickles' antics. Sheriff Sheriff (voiced by Will Carsola) is the unnamed sheriff of Old Town. He lives with his mother and sister. He behaves like a young boy and has a doll named Abbigail, whom he often talks to and has tea parties with. He is often called upon by Henry whenever he has evidence of Mr. Pickles being evil, but Mr. Pickles usually manages to place the blame on somebody else or remove the evidence causing the Sheriff to remain skeptical to the old man's claims. Ironically, despite his dubious abilities as a police officer, the Sheriff is often credited with the capture and arrest of individuals Mr. Pickles sets up to take the fall, contributing to the town's view that the Sheriff is a competent law enforcement official. The Sheriff himself seems to view Mr. Pickles as a good-natured dog and in season 2 even recruits Mr. Pickles as a police dog to help him track down some escaped serial killers. Mr. Pickles even saves the Sheriff from being killed by one of the escaped killers. This makes him one of the few people outside the Goodman family that actually ends up being protected by Mr. Pickles' evil actions. Because of his childlike personality, Mr. Pickles finds it easy to manipulate him, even dressing himself in human skin in Season 3 so he can engage in his daily sexual debauchery and murderous activities, then dressing a pimp in said skin suit and have him be killed by the Sheriff in order to take the fall for Mr. Pickles' activities while at the same time giving the Sheriff the perfect birthday present for his mother, her son being hailed as a hero in the paper for apparently stopping a dangerous serial killer. After Henry finally succeeds in killing Mr Pickles in the Season 4 premiere, Sheriff gets a spin- off called \\"Momma Named Me Sheriff\\" where Stanley is now working for him as a deputy. Recurring characters Steve Steve (voiced by Barbara Goodson) is Henry's wife and Beverly's mother who was originally known as Agnes Gobbleblobber. As revealed by Beverly, who bore some resentment towards her mother for cutting down her dreams of taking a career in fencing to be a housewife, Agnes was once a critical homebody. For reasons yet to be fully revealed, Agnes faked her death and became Mr. Pickles' gimp Steve. Steve lives in the caves under Mr. Pickles' doghouse as its guardian and right hand while often taking part in Mr. Pickles' depraved activities. In the Season 2 finale and Season 3 premiere, assuming she was revived by Mr. Pickles, Henry learns about Steve's true identity as she resumed her original identity while feigning memory loss with the intention to make Henry's life more miserable. But a series of events involving her memories being downloaded exposed her having lied naked with her son-in-law. This provokes Agnes into a rant, revealing that Stanley refused to have sex with her and overstep her boundaries when she insulted Tommy while nearly exposing herself. Agnes realizes too late that she offended Mr. Pickles and she ended up being run over and killed by a truck while pleading for the dog's forgiveness. After being revived by Mr. Pickles, Agnes makes some peace with Henry while making her goodbyes to him and Mr. Pickles before sacrificing herself to destroy the satellite containing her downloaded memories. Before the satellite is destroyed, it is implied from one of her past memories that Agnes became Steve when Mr. Pickles held a knife to her throat and she pleaded for her life. Floyd Floyd (voiced by Dave Stewart) is colleague of Stanley Goodman who works as a telemarketer. Morbidly obese to the point that his excessive fat sags, Floyd is almost always seen eating various foods. He got his obesity from traveling to food competitions, which he won. Because of his competition fame, he is surprisingly quite wealthy and lives in a mansion with his beautiful wife. His mansion's interior designs are made mostly out of food. He also has a gym, but doesn't use it since he can't fit through the door. Despite his appetite and appearance, he seems to get along with others, although Stanley finds him awkward to be around. In the second episode of the second season, Floyd has apparently become more obese. Mr. Bojenkins Mr. Bojenkins (voiced by Frank Collison in 2014‚Äì2016, Alex D√©sert in 2018) is a kindly African-American man that drives a wagon pulled by some large pit bulls. He's known to have sex with multiple women and is considered the Sheriff's best friend. Like the other adults, he makes fun of Grandpa's evil Mr. Pickles stories. In a season 2 episode, Mr. Bojenkins took it upon himself to save the Sheriff from a woman who was the daughter of a crime boss who was held captive by Mr. Pickles since Season 1. After rescuing the Sheriff with the aid of the Sheriff's elderly mother, he ended up sleeping with her. In Season 3, he attempts to teach the Sheriff how to be a man after noticing he is a momma's boy. He takes the Sheriff to a bar and treats him to a drink, but the Sheriff gets really drunk causing havoc in the bar. To make matters worse, Tommy finds Mr. Bojenkins' cellphone which contains the numbers of various women he has been sleeping with, revealing his womanizing ways. They confront him at the bar, revealing that he slept with the Sheriff's mother to the Sheriff who attacks him in a drunken rage. They fall into a river and are washed up to a forest ruled by ravenous wolves. The two argue but are attacked by the wolves, though the Sheriff is able to pacify them briefly with his doll Abigail, before they are dragged away. They meet the leading female of the pack who the Sheriff pacifies, though it works too well causing her to become attracted to the Sheriff who Mr. Bojenkins convinces to have sex with to save their lives, though they are forced to flee when the leading male returns. Mr. Bojenkins reconciles with the Sheriff after their adventure. Linda Linda (voiced by Dave Stewart), also known as \\"Crazy Linda\\", is an unattractive and deranged woman who is Beverly's best friend. She is known for trying to sell people, especially the Goodmans, products that are either old or broken. She was once married to Henry but that was because he was drunk, thanks to Mr. Pickles. She is often seen digging in trash to search for something to sell to people. She also has a daughter named Linda Jr. It is revealed that she's actually very wealthy and lives inside a fancy house that looks like a tree, but would often give some of her money away to the homeless. =Linda Jr.= Linda Jr. is the daughter of Crazy Linda. She looks similar to her mother but is cleaner. She has a thumb growing out of her navel but doesn't let it bother her. She's sweet, kind and helps Tommy learn to be himself and how being different shouldn't let him stop him from doing anything he wants to do. Linda indicates that she doesn't know the identity of her father. Boss Boss (voiced by Will Carsola) is Stanley's young, acne-ridden boss with a shrill, pubescent voice who uses his position to bully Stanley to do undesirable and humiliating things. In Momma Named Me Sheriff, Stanley quit prior to the spin- off. In one episode, his real name is revealed to be \\"Boss\\" and that he has been selling some dangerous items. Bullies The Bullies are two boys that make fun and tease Tommy for his condition while getting into suggestive poses that imply a homosexual attraction between them. In Season 3, it is revealed they are The Blorpton Brothers and Beverly attempts to speak to their parents after they beat up Tommy. However, their white trash parents encourage their behavior as they hate their kids and end up pawning them off to Beverly who is forced to deal with their misbehavior. Mr. Pickles almost kills them when they attack Tommy with vibrators, but Beverly interrupts his attempt to murder them to protect Tommy. Eventually, the bullies are kidnapped by a Motorcycle gang that ride Segways to punish them for their misbehavior, though Beverly rescues them on a motorcycle she built out of household junk and they become afraid of her after she single-handedly defeats the entire gang. Their parents try to ditch their children again but the Sheriff causes Beverly to run over them and their boys. Mr. Pickles decides to take revenge by painting the parents' full body casts and hanging them like pi√±atas for the motorcycle gang member who is celebrating his birthday. Blade Blade is a handicapped computer hacker who Mr. Bojenkins seeks the aid of in Season 2 to help save the Sheriff from his new girlfriend who is actually the daughter of a crime boss. He loves raw bass and tends to offer it to anyone who visits him resulting in his catchphrase \\"Fish?\\", though his grandmother hates that her house is full of stinking fish. In Season 3, Tommy seeks his help when a group of hackers running a memory upload service blackmail the town and seeks his help in stopping them, which results in the memories being downloaded into Tommy's brain, forcing Mr. Pickles to kill the hacker's leader and revive him to save Tommy and prevent Steve's memories from being revealed. Secondary characters Mayor of Old Town The Mayor of Old Town (voiced by John Ennis) appears in the season 2 episode Mental Asylum. Mr. Pickles accidentally kills the Mayor when he is with a prostitute, during one of Mr. Pickles' senseless acts of murder. Mr. Pickles later poses as the Mayor by using the Mayor's skin as a suit in order to free Grandpa Goodman from the asylum. Mr. Pickles makes the Mayor appear crazy at a town hall meeting by humping a female dog, allowing himself to be committed, which allows Mr. Pickles to get inside in order to free Grandpa. =Mayor's Wife= The Mayor's Wife (voiced by Kaitlyn Robrock) is a pompous woman who likes to flaunt her husband's status in front of others like Beverly Goodman, (saying \\"My husband, the Mayor.\\") She is unaware of her husband's unfaithfulness and was unable to tell Mr. Pickles was posing as her husband. She is horrified and publicly disgraced when the Mayor ‚Äì actually Mr. Pickles ‚Äì humps her pet dog during a town meeting. Warden The Warden runs the mental asylum Grandpa is wrongfully taken to. He is known to laugh maniacally in between sentences and deeply desires to lobotomize his patients. He issues a proposal to the Mayor to make lobotomies legal. Mr. Pickles, posing as the Mayor, approves his proposal before he is caught having sex with a dog and is promptly sent to the asylum. The Warden then prepares him for a lobotomy, but Mr. Pickles bursts from his body at the last minute and kidnaps the Warden. The Warden is then taken to Mr. Pickles' lair where he is given a lobotomy by one of the asylum patients (now mutated into a frog after identifying as one). The Warden is seen in the next episode living as a prisoner in Mr. Pickles' lair alive, but clearly different from his lobotomy. Ron Bolton Ron Bolton is a successful lawyer Grandpa hires in Grandpa's Night Out to help him claim infidelity to divorce Linda by hiring several undercover seducers, all of which Mr. Pickles disposes of by either killing or imprisoning them. As a last resort, Ron hires a hitman to kill Linda. Mr. Pickles kills the hitman and frames Ron for the murders of the hitman and the seducers. Baby Man Baby Man is an adult baby who appears in the first episode when Grandpa is taken to one of Mr. Pickles' fetish parties where the dog proceeds to kill and dismember the party-goers (excluding the Baby Man). Mr. Pickles later fuses him with the body parts of the other fetishists (both dead and alive). Despite this, the Baby Man's playful attitude still remains, although is often be found aggressively demanding milk, and appears from time to time in Mr. Pickles' lair. Frog Man Frog Man is a former patient at Old Town Mental Asylum. He is first seen admitting himself into the asylum, claiming that he thinks he's a tomato. When he's in the asylum, he sees an episode of Astronaut Dolphin Detective and then identifies himself as a frog. Mr. Pickles later kidnaps him after threatening the Warden to release Grandpa. Using various dead body parts, Mr. Pickles sews the man into a giant froglike body with little drills for fingers. The Frog Man is then used to perform a lobotomy on the Warden. Doc Walton Doc Walton is a cross-eyed plastic surgeon who offers numerous cosmetic procedures (advertised as \\"jobs\\") from within his horse-driven wagon. Tommy confuses his \\"jobs\\" as employment and is given a breast enlargement as a result. Doc Walton is later kidnapped by Mr. Pickles and taken to his lair where he is given a set of six large breasts. He is seen in the background of the second season inside Mr. Pickles' lair. Bigfoot Bigfoot (voiced by Sean Conroy) is a former criminal named Vito Pizzarelli who was one of the mob's most feared hitmen before he was caught by the police. They forced Vito to rat out the entire Gabagoolie criminal organization and he was then placed under different surgeries to portray the eponymous legendary figure by the witness protection program. Tommy and Mr. Pickles encounter Bigfoot in the woods and he agrees to help bake a new Father's Day pie after he ate the previous one. Mr. Pickles also helps Bigfoot by killing the Gabagoolie who wished to exact their revenge when they discovered his identity after he was caught in the grocery store picking up ingredients. Bigfoot reappears in season two, now married to a doe (dubbed his \\"dear wife\\") who gave birth to his son, Dear Boy, a deer-human hybrid. Bigfoot gets Tommy to look after his son while he spends some alone time with his wife. Unfortunately, his wife is killed by some hunters. Bigfoot claims that in his past he would have sought revenge, but his fatherhood has now changed him. Bigfoot mourns the loss of his wife at a campfire where he is confronted by the hunter who killed his wife. Mr. Pickles saves him by killing the hunter, and Bigfoot then asks him to look after his Dear Boy again while he spends time with his new lover, an owl. The Cannibal The Cannibal is a convicted serial killer and cannibal who is the main antagonist in the episode Serial Killers. He is considered too strange for \\"normal\\" serial killers and is prone to making cannibal-themed puns while licking his lips. He escaped police custody when he broke out of his cuffs inside the police car before eating Rape-and-Kill Ronny. The bus then crashed and released the remaining criminals during the road collision in the series opening. The Cannibal befriends Grandpa with the intent of feeding on him and soon gets invited to have dinner with his family. The Sheriff mistakes the Cannibal for a gum thief when he misconstrues his puns and joins the dinner in preparation to arrest him while the Cannibal plans to kill everyone. However, Mr. Pickles replaces his shiv with a stolen packet of gum and the Cannibal is then arrested for stealing gum alongside the actual gum thief who was mistaken for the cannibal. The Cannibal once again escapes custody, but is ritually killed by Mr. Pickles who removes his heart before playing with it. Superhero Guy Superhero Guy (voiced by Will Carsola) is an ex-superhero whose superhero career was destroyed when his true identity (Phil Robertson) was revealed by a baby pulling his mask off after he rescued a bunch of babies from a burning nursery that Crime Man blew up. This resulted in people calling him to do mundane tasks which led him to become addicted to sh√∂venpucker: the act of shoving super sour candy balls up his anus to get high. When the candy was banned, Superhero Guy started buying them from back-alley dealers and stealing steel to sell after he became bankrupt to feed his addiction. After Superhero Guy stole Tommy's leg braces, Tommy and Sidekick Boy attempt to help him by luring the now-elderly Superhero Guy into a rehab center using a piece of steel. Superhero Guy then stole the key to his secret base in hopes of selling the steel robot suit, but ended up using the suit to steal cars and a bridge to sell as metal. When Superhero Guy goes to the recycling plant, Mr. Pickles forces him into a large compacter but refrains from killing him when he notices Tommy's braces are inside, too. Superhero Guy then escapes, but ends up having his body fused into Crime Man's vehicle that Mr. Pickles rides in the night. =Sidekick Boy= 'Sidekick Boy (voiced by Tom Kenny) is the sidekick of Superhero Guy.

Crime Man Crime Man (voiced by Bob Bergen) is a supervillain that terrorizes Old Town. He was responsible for blowing up the nursery which led to events that led to Superhero Guy accidentally getting unmasked. In the present, Crime Man is still causing trouble.

Dear Boy is put under Tommy's protection when he wants to prove that he can be responsible, but Dear Boy's uncontrollable nature causes them to have a run-in with a couple of hunters. Dear Boy then has his foot caught in a bear trap and begs Tommy to euthanize him with a gun. However, his father soon rescues him just after his mother is killed. Due to him being part-human, Dear Boy is immune to Mr. Pickles' mind-controlling powers. Jon Gabagooli Jon Gabagooli (voiced by Frank Vincent) is the boss of the Gabagooli criminal family.

He resembles a priest with a large beard that is constantly stroked by a pair of beautiful women. His body is covered in tattoos of vegan slogans and vegetables, and his genitals have been completely removed. Beverly is invited to his headquarters and greatly upsets him with her misunderstanding of veganism (she believes one can both eat animal products and be vegan at the same time). He attempts to convert her to veganism by showing her a fake slaughterhouse video and locking her in a cage like an animal. Fearing that Beverly's influence will corrupt the other vegans, he decides to perform an ancient vegan ceremony from \\"hundreds and hundreds of months ago\\". He tied Beverly to a large V while blindfolded so that they can beat the 'ignorance' out of her with hammers. Beverly is saved when a non-vegan pizza she delivered earlier arrives which causes the other vegans to give in.

Parister and Tharanga Athuraliya for Niro Films. It stars an all-female cast of 36 actresses, including, Udari Perera, Dilhani Ekanayake and Menik Wijewardena in lead role along with Deepani Silva, Vishaka Siriwardena and Gayathri Dias. Music composed by Sarath Wickrama. This is Sri Lanka's first all-female featuring movie. It is the 1299th Sri Lankan film in the Sinhala cinema. title card The film has been shot around Matale and Riverston areas. It is the first Sri Lankan film with an all-female cast. Plot At the beginning of the film, it shows a girl placing a flower bouquet on a grave. One lady there, (I.P.Waruni) recalls her past and the film continues... The film follows a story of a troupe of girls who are on an adventure to unearth the truth behind the death of a young girl called Krishani Mendis (fictional character) in the cold hill country. The murderer is Nimesha, the elder sister of Nirasha(Udari) who is one of the girls who meet the spirit of Krishani in human form when they go to make a film in the hill country. Krishanthi calls herself Maduka, which isn't her real name. The girls meet Maduka on their way to the villa where they stay on the days of shooting their film. Maduka tells them that her vehicle has broken down. The girls invite her to join them. They have a great time there. Sometimes they make the housekeeper annoyed. Nirasha writes the stript for their story. One night, the spirit of Krishani takes over Nirasha's body. One of the girls gets injured in shooting the film so Maduka is asked to act instead of her. When they come home, they watch the film they made and admire Maduka's acting. Meanwhile, one of the girls finds a newspaper advertisement that says it's a year since a person called Krishani Mendis had died. She notices that the picture in the advertisement is similar to Madukha's. She is horrified, and tells the other girls about this. They watch the film again. To their astonishment, Maduka is not visible in the film. Instead, a smoke-like figure is visible. As the story moves on, the girls notice that Nirasha suddenly, behaves like Maduka. Funnily enough, when she becomes normal, she can't remember whether she did those things. For example, Nirasha can't drive cars but she drives a car which happens to be Krishanthi's. The servant of their house discovers that Nimesha does not behave in the decent manner as she used to do. The girls meet I.P. Waruni(Dihani) in police and get her support to solve this mystery. At their first meeting,I.P. Waruni tells them that Krishani had committed suicide and they have found poison in her body, but with their request, she starts a new investigation. They go through details given by two of Krishani's friends Pathima and another friend Subadra (who is working as a nurse). Meanwhile, Nirasha hit her mother on the head to get her hospitalized. I.P.Waruni goes to her house and discovers the connection between Krishani and Nimesha by seeing a photos of them by chance. Furthermore, she discovers that there was a big argument between them over a boy who was loved by both of them. I.P.Waruni finally decides to arrest Nirasha because she suspected her behaviour. She concludes that Nirasha did this purposely so that her elder sister Nimesha would come from abroad to see her mother. That would be the only way Krishani can take revenge from her. The story concludes as Krishani uses Nimesha to take revenge from Nimesha. She pushes Nimesha from the cliff just as Nimesha pushed Krishanthi. Before that Nirasha injects poison into Nimesha's body just as Nimesha did to Krishani. At the end of the film Krishani goes out of Nirasha's body as she has taken revenge from her murderer.

Overview The Ganges is a long river carrying a huge discharge of 70,000 m3/s. However, the river bank erosion problems are restricted to a few places. Floods and erosion pose a serious problem in the lower Ganges region, particularly in West Bengal. The Ganges enters West Bengal after/ near Rajmahal hills in Jharkhand. After flowing through Malda district, it enters Murshidabad district, where it splits into two river channels ‚Äì the Bhagirathi flows south through West Bengal and the Padma flows east into Bangladesh. River bank erosion is a common problem in river channels in the deltaic tracts and is widespread throughout the course of the Ganges in West Bengal. Official reports show that on an average 8 km2 of land is engulfed annually by the river in West Bengal. The Ganges forms one of the major river systems in India. From the Gangotri Glacier, it traverses a distance of 2,525 km to the Bay of Bengal. The river carries millions of tonnes of sediment load and deposits it in the plains. The sediment deposition creates many severe problems like the decrease of river depth. The Ganges is a meandering river and Farakka Barrage has disrupted the dynamic equilibrium of the river and hindered the natural oscillation of the river within its meandering belt, which is about 10 km wide in Malda and Murshidabad districts. The river has a general tendency to shift towards the left bank upstream of the Farakka Barrage and towards the right bank below the Farakka Barrage. River bank failure is because of certain factors like soil stratification of the river bank, presence of hard rocky area (Rajmahal), high load of sediment, difficulty of dredging and construction of Farakka Barrage as an obstruction to the natural river flow. The rivers in Murshidabad district have been continuously changing their meandering-geometry actively since second half of the twentieth century but the dimension of river bank erosion has been increased after construction of Farakka Barrage. More than 200 km2 of fertile land was completely wiped out till 2004 in Malda district. As of 2004, the Ganges had eroded 356 km2 of fertile land and displaced around 80,000 people in the period 1988 ‚Äì 1994, in Murshidabad district. Malda district In the early decades of the twentieth century, the Ganges flowed in a south-easterly course between Rajmahal and Farakka, but later in the century it formed a large meander to accommodate the additional water because of the barrage construction. Furthermore, nearly 64 crore (640 million) tonnes of silt is accumulated annually on the river bed. All these lead to massive erosion of the left bank. During the period 1969-1999, 4.5 lakh people were affected by left bank erosion of the Ganges in Malda district, upstream of the Farakka Barrage. 22 mouzas in Manickchak, Kaliachak I and Kaliachak II CD Blocks have gone into the river. Other affected areas are in Kaliachak III, Ratua I and Ratua II CD Blocks. The worst-hit areas lie in the left bank of the river stretch between Bhutnidiara and Panchanandapore in the Kaliachak II block. Even in the 1960s, Panchanandapur was a flourishing river-port and trading centre. It had the block headquarters, high school, sugar mill and a regular weekly market where traders used to come by large boats from Rajmahal, Sahebganj, Dhulian and other towns. After being hit by river bank erosion much of what was there at Panchanandapur has shifted to Chethrumahajantola. The Ganga Bhangan Pratirodh Action Nagarik Committee‚Äôs survey revealed a loss of 750 km2 area in Kaliachak and Manikchak. 60 primary schools, 14 high schools, coveted mango orchards have gone leaving 40,000 affected families. During the period 1990-2001 Hiranandapur, Manikchak, Gopalpur of Manikchak CD Block and Kakribondha Jhaubona of Kaliachak II CD Block were badly affected by river bank erosion. In 2004-05 large scale erosion took place in Kakribondha Jhaubona and Panchanandapur-I gram panchayats of Kaliachak II CD Block and Dakshin Chandipur, Manikchak, and Dharampur gram panchayets of Manikchak CD Block. Kakribondha Jhaubona, a gram panchayat, was totally lost by river bank erosion. The affected persons and their administrative responsibilities were merged with Bangitola gram panchayet administration. River bank failures occur in two phases. Pre-flood bank failure occurs because of the high pressure of increasing water on the bank walls. During floods the area is submerged and water seeps into the weak soil. After the floods, the banks collapse in chunks. Every monsoon a large number people are affected by river bank erosion. They become landless and lose their livelihood. It creates neo- refugees with many social problems. Sometimes, poverty leads to increase in crime. The consequences of floods are of the short range as economic recovery is possible, but effects of the slow and steady disaster of river bank erosion are of permanent nature, where the entire socio-economic structure is damaged and the affected population has to move and settle somewhere else. People seriously affected by river bank erosion in Malda have migrated in search of work to as far as Gujarat and Maharashtra. At Byculla, Mumbai, there is a whole colony of erosion affected people of Malda, where they are often branded as Bangladeshi infiltrators, as they have lost not only their belongings but also their documents in the erosion. Such is the tragedy of these neo-refugees in their own country. In the remote past, the Ganges used to flow past Gauda, 40 km downstream from Rajmahal. Over a long period, the river shifted westward and now it tends to come to its earlier position. Therefore, the whole belt up to Gauda is risk zone for river bank erosion. A group of experts has suggested the pressure on the left bank be reduced by diverting flow from the eroding channel. Alternatively, it is possible that in one devastating flood the Ganges will merge with Kalindri in the eastern side and the combined flow will merge with Mahananda at Nimasarai Ghat of Malda and afterwards the collective flow will merge with Ganges/ Padma in Godagari Ghat of Bangladesh. The Ganges has numerous abandoned channels in the area. Murshidabad district As of 2013, an estimated 2.4 million people reside along the banks of the Ganges alone in Murshidabad district. The main channel of the Ganges has a bankline of 94 km along its right bank from downstream of Farakka Barrage to Jalangi. Severe erosion occurs all along this bank. From a little above Nimtita, about 20 km downstream from Farakka, the Ganges flows along the international boundary with Bangladesh in the left bank. The following blocks have to face the brunt of erosion year after year: Farakka, Samserganj, Suti I, Suti II, Raghunathganj II, Lalgola, Bhagawangola I, Bhagawangola II, Raninagar I, Raninagar II and Jalangi. Between 1931 and 1977, 26,769 hectares have been eroded and many villages have been fully submerged. According to government reports between 1988 and 1994, 206.60 square km. land was eroded displacing 14,236 families. Dhulian and its adjoining areas were greatly affected in mid 1970s when about 50,000 people became homeless. The encroaching river wiped out 50 mouzas and engulfed about 10,000 hectares of fertile land. 1980-1990 was a decade of erosion for this district and during the decade Giria, Sekhalipur, Khejustala, Mithipur, Fajilpur, Rajapur, Akheriganj, Parashpur villages were badly affected. Many families living along the Ganges continue to be affected. As for example, in 2007, severe erosion occurred in Lalgola, Bhagawangola II, Farakka and Raninnagar II CD Blocks. In 2008, 1,245 families were affected in Lalgola, Bhagawangola I and Bhagawangola II CD Blocks. According to the Report on Impact of the Farakka Barrage on the Human Fabric: \\"People in Murshidabad had been experiencing erosion for the last two centuries but the ravages caused by the mighty Padma at Akheriganj in 1989 and 1990 surpassed all previous records. Akheriganj disappeared from the map destroying 2,766 houses, leaving 23,394 persons homeless many of whom migrated to the newly emerged Nirmal char along the opposite bank‚Ä¶. This area has lost its school, college, places of worship, panchayat office to the raging Padma‚Ä¶. Original Akheriganj of nearly 20,000 inhabitants has gone into the river around 1994.\\" \\"Jalangi situated 50 km east of Baharampur district headquarter has suffered tremendously in 1994-95. At Jalangi Bazaar severe erosion started in September 1995 engulfing nearly 400 metre width of land within a week and then high built up homestead land thereby destroying Jalangi High School, Gram Panchayat Office, Thana and innumerable buildings rendering nearly 12000 people homeless.\\" \\"As per official estimate, till 1992-94 more than 10,000 hectares of chars (flood plain sediment island) have developed in main places, which have become inaccessible from the Indian side but can be reached easily from Bangladesh. The erosion wiped away boundary posts at many places creating border dispute. In Parliament when this issue was raised the House was assured that the boundary was fixed on the map even though the river has shifted\\". \\"One typical example is that of Nirmal char built by eroding Akheriganj. Here a population of 20,000 lives in an area of 50 sq.km. From here Rajshahi city of Bangladesh can be reached within 45 minutes on road whereas to come to the mainland of India one has to cross the mighty Padma which will take more than three hours. Moreover, the basic infrastructure provided here is too poor and the people‚Äôs plight is further heightened by negligence of the mainland administration. Since there is no primary health centre, people go to Rajshahi for treatment. The concept of international border is very much flexible here due to basic problems of living. Instances of fighting for harvesting with Bangladeshi cultivators have been reported again and again apart from the usual problem of allotting created land to the rightful owners. Once again, the question of Bangladeshi infiltrators, the recent fiasco over ISI agents have increased in this district due to these char areas.\\" \\"Downstream of Jangipur Barrage the river Ganga/Padma is swinging away close to river Bhagirathi at Fazilpur leaving only 1.34 km. in width. In 1996, this distance was 2.86 km. If Ganga/Padma actually merges with Bhagirathi due to the natural tendency, it will lead to flood and catastrophe in the entire Bhagirathi basin. Bhagirathi water remains at a higher elevation than the river Ganga/Padma during lean season and if they merge the water of the feeder canal will flow through Padma to Bangladesh defeating the very purpose of the Farakka Project.\\" References Erosion Hydrology Ganges Malda district Murshidabad district ","title":"River bank erosion along the Ganges in Malda and Murshidabad districts"},{"id":"55178074","text":"Mustafa Nano (born 4 janar. 1960 Shijak, Durr√´s) is an Albanian political analyst, journalist and writer.

The convoy split on 15 January 1944, with Chios continuing on in convoy KMS 38G, arriving in Gibraltar, on 17 January. It's possible that she was delayed from sailing in the first, here intended convoy, and had to travel in the proceeding convoy.

After the critical success of Momus' Biblical- themed and stripped down debut album Circus Maximus (1986), Momus left √©l Records and signed with Creation Records after he bonded with record label boss Alan McGee. His first release for the label, The Poison Boyfriend is a song cycle that features a full band; its first half features acoustic-based singer-songwriter songs with cabaret pop influences, while the more upbeat second half features synthesisers and drum machines. Lyrically, The Poison Boyfriend is broad in its subject matter, though largely psychosexual, with lyrics including themes of sexual depravity and voyeurism and writing styles such as character sketches. \\"Murderers, the Hope of Women\\" was released as a single ahead of the album's release. Upon its release, The Poison Boyfriend garnered favourable reviews from critics. NME named the album one of the best of 1987, while Fact Magazine later named the album the 81st best album of the 1980s. Momus would later develop upon the album's sexual themes on later recordings. Background Momus (Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Currie) released his debut album, Circus Maximus, on √©l Records in 1986, which, in addition to being a critical success, became the label's most commercially successful release. Stylistically, the album was stripped down and featured heavy Biblical references. Circus Maximus caught the attention of Creation Records boss Alan McGee, who then signed Momus to Creation. While the signing was \\"something of a leap for Creation,\\" given how Momus' literate and caustic lyrics departed from the vaguer lyrics typical of those on the label's roster, Momus and McGee had shared interests in decadence and sex; Momus recalled \\"I was getting a bit of press in The Face and the NME, and I think Alan's interest might have been perked by the fact I'd written an article about Jacques Brel in which I said that Brel was more thrilling and dangerous than a thousand Jesus and Mary Chains, and Alan had just lost them at that point, so maybe something in that resonated.\\" Momus felt he would be greeted with more attention on Creation Records, while also conceding that being signed to the label would aesthetically \\"be a more toxic environment in some ways and there would be a certain kind of hideous Sixties revivalism saying it all goes back to the Pebbles compilation.\\" The Poison Boyfriend was recorded with producer Julian Standen and was engineered by Douglas Morris. Momus used a full band on The Poison Boyfriend, consisting of bassist Fein O'Lochlainn, drummer Terry Neilson, keyboardist Dean Klerat and extra percussionist Arun G. Shendurnikar. Music and lyrics Momus, pictured in 2005. With Momus enlisting a backup band for The Poison Boyfriend, the album is a departure from his debut album, and has been described by writer Richard King as a \\"Gallic-flavoured song cycle.\\" The first seven songs on the album add elements of cabaret pop, such as French accordion and waltzes, to Momus' singer-songwriter format influenced by Leonard Cohen, a style described by The Rough Guide to Rock as subdued and sometimes reminiscent of Nick Drake, whereas the last four songs are more upbeat and energetic, featuring synthesisers and drum machines. Several songs, such as \\"Sex for the Disabled\\", are said to border on synthpop. Lyrically, The Poison Boyfriend departs from the obscure religious themes of Circus Maximus, instead displaying a wider frame of lyrical reference, most notably incorporating a psychosexual theme that Momus would later develop on later releases. King felt the album \\"shone a light into a meditative and reflective voyeur's idea of romance.\\" Subjects throughout the album include sexual depravity, prurient postcards, \\"nested despair\\" and acerbic tale-telling, with the lyrical style incorporating character sketches, complex symbolism, flowery language and elaborate metaphors. Momus felt his exploring of taboo subjects was largely due to \\"being ashamed of my proper, middle-class upbringing.\\" \\"What Will Death Be Like?\\" makes use of repetition, with a simplistic pattern repeated throughout its seven-minute duration. Of the songs on side two, \\"Situation Comedy Blues\\" incorporates a mock-Motown Sound, while \\"Sex for the Disabled\\" is a quasi-soul \\"horny sex rap\\" in a Phil Spector-style Wall of Sound arrangement that Doug Brod of Trouser Press felt was a pastiche of Barry White, and which Huey compared to Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\". Lyrically, the \\"comically torchy\\" song is a surreal allegory concerning Thatcher's Britain, making note of Margaret Thatcher's contemporary \\"swerve in priorities.\\" Described by Huey as \\"disarming\\" and the album's biggest stylistic change, \\"Closer to You\\" is a deliberate self-parody in which Momus \\"croons horny, confessional come-ons like a bookish Barry White.\\" One writer felt the song was \\"a claustrophobic and uncomfortably personal exploration of obsession and longing.\\" Reception In 1986, the album was promoted with the \\"Murderers, the Hope of Women\\" twelve-inch single, containing the first three songs from the album. Released in July 1987 on Creation Records, his first album on the label, The Poison Boyfriend received favourable critical reception, and in his book How Soon is Now?: The Madmen and Mavericks who made Independent Music 1975‚Äì2005, Richard King, noting Momus' ambitions of the album, felt that the opening lyrics to \\"Closer to You\\"‚Äì\\"Maybe you're the Circle Line girl,\\"‚Äì were muttered \\"with a claustrophobic intensity\\" that confirmed Momums' ambitions were \\"set in an entirely different context from the rest of Creation's roster.\\" Momus would expand upon the sexual themes of The Poison Boyfriend on later albums. In a retrospective review, Doug Brod of Trouser Press wrote that \\"on The Poison Boyfriend, Currie dispenses with the religious imagery and enlists a backup band, while taking a less studied approach to consistently ace material,\\" while finding Momus' \\"bayonet wit\\" to be most obvious on \\"Sex for the Disabled,\\" which he felt was \\"a horny faux-soul sex rap with everything but the heavy breathing.\\" Steve Huey of AllMusic was more reserved, rating the album three stars out of five. While finding issue with \\"a sense that the author is hiding behind his own cleverness,\\" he nonetheless conceded that the album marked a leap forward in Momus' career, and concluded: \\"The Poison Boyfriend does reward some of the effort it demands, and points the way toward Momus' more fully realized Creation albums.\\" In The Rough Guide to Rock, the album is favourably assessed and named \\"a magic creation.\\" NME ranked the album at number 39 in their list of the 50 best albums of 1987. In 2012, NME included it in their list of \\"20 Lost Albums Ripe for Rediscovery,\\" with Brett Anderson of Suede praising the album, saying: \\"There‚Äôs a beautiful hazy melancholy to much of this record, his second release, which I think he lost as the songs became more twisted and intellectualised on later albums.\\" NME then included it in the list's extended \\"100 Great Albums You've Never Heard\\" form, where Anderson elaborated: \\"there was a delicate, less brazen element to the poetry, perfectly capturing the mood of Jacques Brel with their beautifully intense indifference.\\" In 2013, Fact magazine ranked the album at number 81 in its list of \\"The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s,\\" writing \\"The Poison Boyfriend confounds as often as it delights ‚Äì if Private Eye's Pseuds Corner concerned itself with the Creation catalogue, Currie would be a regular fixture ‚Äì but as far as spooked, naughty indie goes, The Poison Boyfriend is in a (top set) class of its own.\\" Track listing All songs written by Nicholas Currie (Momus). # \\"Murderers, the Hope of Women\\" ‚Äì 5:18 # \\"Eleven Executioners\\" ‚Äì 4:02 # \\"What Will Death Be Like?\\" ‚Äì 7:04 # \\"The Gatecrasher\\" ‚Äì 4:58 # \\"Violets\\" ‚Äì 4:56 # \\"Islington John\\" ‚Äì 5:15 # \\"Three Wars\\" ‚Äì 5:46 # \\"Flame into Being\\" ‚Äì 5:22 # \\"Situation Comedy Blues\\" ‚Äì 3:48 # \\"Sex for the Disabled\\" ‚Äì 4:51 # \\"Closer to You\\" ‚Äì 7:32 Personnel *Nicholas Currie (Momus) ‚Äì songwriter *Julian Standen ‚Äì producer *Fein O'Lochlainn ‚Äì bass *Vici MacDonald ‚Äì sleeve design *Terry Neilson ‚Äì drums *Douglas Morris ‚Äì engineer *Dean Klerat ‚Äì keyboards *Arun G.

The shrine is one of the most celebrated in Lahore, and has historically been revered by both Muslims and Sikhs. Location The tomb is located in the Alam Ganj neighbourhood of the Dharampura municipality, approximately 3 kilometres west of Lahore's Walled City. History Mian Mir wished to be buried next to his long-time friend Syed Muhammad Natha Shah Gilani. The tomb was built on the orders of Dara Shikoh, and was completed in 1640. Dara Shikoh had previously built a shrine dedicated to Mullah Shah, but intended for the shrine of Mian Mir to more superb. After Dara Shikoh's death, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb used much of the material collected by Dara Shikoh for the construction of Mian Mir's tomb, and instead used those materials in the construction of Lahore's grand Badshahi Mosque. The shrine was embellished by the use of precious stones, which were all removed by the Sikh Emperor Ranjit Singh in the 19th century to embellish the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Singh, however, had the interior of the shrine painted with floral patterns. Though a pilgrim to the shrine, Ranjit Singh also plundered the shrine of its marble for use in construction of his baradari at the Hazuri Bagh near the Badshahi Mosque and Lahore Fort. Architecture The shrine is popular with devotees. The tomb is enclosed by a rectangular structure topped by a dome made of gray granite with eaves overhanging the structure known as a chajja. The entire tomb is built upon a raised square plinth made of white marble that measures 54 feet on each edge. The tomb is surrounded by a courtyard made of red sandstone. The tomb itself is accessible from the courtyard by a set of steps made of white marble. The tomb is located in the centre of quadrangle measuring 200 feet on each side. The quadrangle is enclosed by high walls containing numerous small cells that form a cloister around the tomb on the southern and eastern side of the complex that were used by dervishes and pilgrims. The western portion of the complex is defined by a mosque constructed of pink sandstone, with five short domes atop it. A pink sandstone gateway leads to the shrine, with a couplet in Persian over the entrance reading: Associated shrines Adjacent to the tomb is the tomb of Mian Mir's nephew Muhammed Sharif, who served as the first sajjada nashin, or hereditary caretaker of the shrine. Another tomb, that of Haji Muhammed Saleh, is also located within the shrine complex. The shrine is located immediately west of the tomb of Nadira Begum, wife of the Mughal prince Dara Shikoh. The shrine of Mullah Shah was also built near the shrine. Urs festival The shrine is illuminated during the annual urs festival, and on religious holidays. His death anniversary, known as an urs, is observed there by his devotees every year.Death anniversary of Mian Mir observed in Lahore, The Nation newspaper, Published 20 December 2015, Retrieved 17 June 2017 Influence Devotees frequently tie strings of thread as prayers. The nearby Lahore Cantonment was originally named \\"Mian Mir Cantonment\\" in reference to the saint's shrine. The tomb has been used as a focal point to bring together Muslim and Sikhs. The shrine has been suggested to be model for the Golden Temple in nearby Amritsar. Shrine administration The shrine is managed by an Awqaf committee that consists of influential persons, such as judges and politicians. The committee has also included a Sikh organization, Guru Nanak Ji Mission, in the committee's activities.

It is a source of multiple bioactive compounds, including phospholipids, glycolipids, glycoproteins, and carbohydrates that have important functional roles within the brain and gut. Preclinical studies have demonstrated effects of MFGM-derived bioactive components on brain structure and function, intestinal development, and immune defense. Similarly, pediatric clinical trials have reported beneficial effects on cognitive and immune outcomes. In populations ranging from premature infants to preschool-age children, dietary supplementation with MFGM or its components has been associated with improvements in cognition and behavior, gut and oral bacterial composition, fever incidence, and infectious outcomes including diarrhea and otitis media. MFGM may also play a role in supporting cardiovascular health by modulating cholesterol and fat uptake. Clinical trials in adult populations have shown that MFGM could positively affect markers associated with cardiovascular disease including lowering serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.  Origin   MFGM secretion process in milk  Milk lipids are secreted in a unique manner by lactocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells within the alveoli of the lactating mammary gland. The process takes place in multiple stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between the inner and outer phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 Œºm in average diameter, is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. This secretion process occurs in all types of mammalian milk, including human and bovine. However, it is distinct from the lipid secretion mechanism used by all other non-mammary cells. That makes MFGM unique to milk and it is not present in non-dairy food products.  Sources of MFGM  MFGM is a structurally complex bioactive milk component, found in human milk as well as the milk of other mammalian species. The MFGM in human milk contains many bioactive components with diverse functions and has been linked to cognitive and health benefits to infants. Some compositional differences are reported to exist between species, but bovine MFGM, the best-studied non-human source, generally contains a lipid and protein composition, which is similar to that of human MFGM. MFGM makes up an estimated 2-6% of the total fat globules. As raw milk has an average total fat content around 4%, it therefore contains around 0.08-0.24% of MFGM. In other words, 417‚Äì1250 kg of raw milk is needed to supply 1 kg of MFGM. The content of MFGM in dairy products varies depending on the processing involved. During dairy processing such as churning or decreaming, the MFGM is disrupted and preferentially distributed into aqueous phases such as buttermilk, butter serum, or certain type of whey. Thus they can be a good source of MFGM for addition into food products. For example, infant formulas traditionally were lacking the MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more recent advances in technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat globule, allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and can be added to infant formula or other nutritional products.  Structure and components   General structure  The milk fat globule is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting mammary epithelial cell (lactocyte). This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. While MFGM makes up only an estimated 2% to 6% of the total milk fat globule, it is an especially rich phospholipid source, accounting for the majority of total milk phospholipids. In contrast, the inner core of the milk fat globule is composed predominantly of triacylglycerols. The MFGM structure is complex and comprises a variety of phospholipids, glycolipids, proteins, and glycoproteins, along with cholesterol and other lipids. Specific lipids and proteins are localized to different layers of the membrane, with carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids directed toward the outer surface of the milk fat globule; the lipid-to-protein weight ratio in MFGM is approximately 1:1. However, the nutritional significance of these components is defined not only by their structure or macronutrient category, but also by the physiological role that each nutrient serves. As a quantitatively minor presence within milk, MFGM likely contributes little to energy production, but its constituents may confer structural and functional benefits. Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, and elsewhere in the body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated. Lipid components The lipid component of MFGM is rich in phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis during the first year of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain. Each of these lipid classes is known to play functional roles within the body, including the support of gut, immune, and central nervous system development.  Protein components  Besides the polar lipids, the outer layer of MFGM contains a number of glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins. Proteomic analysis has revealed at least 191 different known proteins in human MFGM, and comparable numbers in bovine milk protein concentrates. While quantitatively these only represent 1% to 2% of total milk protein content, MFGM proteins are of significant interest because many are known to have bioactive and potentially beneficial properties; almost half of identified proteins have membrane/protein trafficking or cell signaling functions. The glycosylated proteins, including mucins (MUC-1, MUC-4, MUC-15), butyrophilin, lactadherin, and CD36, have been suggested to enhance triacylglyceride digestion efficiency. Furthermore, lactadherin and MUC-1, in addition to the non-glycosylated protein xanthine oxidase, have been shown or suggested in preclinical studies to possess antimicrobial properties.  Health Benefits of MFGM  Research has indicated that MFGM, or components thereof, may potentially play roles in brain development and cognitive function, immunity and gut health, and cardiovascular health.  Brain development and cognitive function  MFGM lipid components such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides are highly concentrated in the brain and support synaptogenesis and myelination. In the central nervous system, sphingomyelin is a key component of the myelin sheath, which insulates axons and supports efficient transmission of nerve impulses. During myelination, nerve axons are wrapped with multiple layers of cell membrane by oligodendrocyte glial cells, a process that accounts for a large portion of brain growth during late gestation and the first two years of life, but which can also continue up to 5‚Äì10 years of age. Meanwhile, gangliosides are concentrated within the brain‚Äôs gray matter and constitute approximately 6% to 10% of the total human brain lipid mass. Additionally, gangliosides are enriched at the synaptic membrane of neurons, and are functionally involved in neurotransmission and synapse formation. Brain ganglioside accretion occurs at an accelerated rate in the early years of life, coinciding with the most active period of myelination, axonal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis. Alongside the growth of brain size, total brain ganglioside concentration also increases 3-fold from early fetal development to 5 years of age. = Preclinical data = A number of preclinical studies have been conducted using MFGM and combinations of MFGM-derived components. Liu et al. (2014) studied brain development and spatial learning and memory in neonatal piglets. Piglets that were fed with a formula containing milk phospholipids and gangliosides to mimic levels in human milk made choices more rapidly and with fewer errors in a spatial T-maze cognitive test compared to controls, implying improved spatial learning. Similarly, Vickers et al. (2009) demonstrated that administration of complex milk lipids to rats from postnatal day 10 through adulthood (day 80) led to significant improvements in learning and memory tasks compared to control animals. Conversely, a study of complex milk lipid supplementation to pregnant mice did not have an effect on cognitive tasks in their offspring. = Clinical data = Several studies of diets supplemented with MFGM and its components, including gangliosides and sphingomyelin, have aimed to address measures of cognitive development in pediatric populations. In some of the studies, MFGM supplementation to infant formula was shown to narrow the gap in cognitive development between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Tanaka et al. (2013) studied the neurobehavioral effects of feeding formula supplemented with sphingomyelin-enriched phospholipid in 24 very low birth weight preterm infants (birth weight <1500 g). In this double-blind RCT, the preterm infants were fed either control formula containing phospholipids derived from egg yolk lecithin with sphingomyelin at 13% of total phospholipid or a supplemented formula with milk-derived phospholipids containing 20% sphingomyelin. Infants fed the supplemented formula had significantly higher percentages of sphingomyelin in total plasma phospholipids after 4, 6, and 8 weeks of feeding compared to those fed the control formula. The infants fed the supplemented formula also showed improvements across multiple developmental measures at 18 months, with significantly better scores on the Behavior Rating Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II), the Fagan test (novelty preference rate), the latency of visual evoked potentials (VEP), and sustained attention test than in the control group. Gurnida et al. (2012) assessed the cognitive effects of formula supplemented with a ganglioside-enriched, MFGM-derived complex milk lipid in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, healthy infants (2‚Äì8 weeks of age) were fed until 6 months of age, either control infant formula (n=30), or a supplemented infant formula (n=29) with added complex milk lipids to increase ganglioside concentration to approximately 11-12 Œºg/mL to be within the human milk range. A breastfed reference group (n=32) was also included. Results showed that serum ganglioside levels in the supplemented group were significantly higher compared to the control group at 6 months, but did not significantly differ from levels in the breastfed group. The cognitive outcomes measured using the Griffiths Mental Development Scale showed that the supplemented group had significantly increased scores for Hand and Eye Coordination, Performance, and Total Score (General Quotient) at 6 months compared to the control group, and there were no significant differences in cognitive performance compared to the breastfed reference group. Timby et al. (2014) also assessed the potential impact of MFGM supplementation on cognitive development in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months old) were fed until 6 months of age either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed reference group (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive scores than the control group (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed reference group. In contrast, there were no significant differences in motor domain scores between the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the reference group in the verbal domain. Veereman-Wauters et al. (2012) assessed the potential behavioral benefits of MFGM supplementation in young children. In this double-blind RCT, healthy preschool children (2.5 to 6 years of age) consumed for 4 months, either a control formula (n=97) providing 60 mg/day of endogenous phospholipid, or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=85) providing a total of 500 mg/day of dairy- derived phospholipids. At the end of the trial, parents and teachers completed the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA), a validated questionnaire considered to be a gold standard for assessing emotion and behavior in preschool children.B√©rub√©, R.L. and Achenbach, T.M., 2007. Bibliography of published studies using the ASEBA. Burlington, VT: University of Vermont, Research Center for Children, Youth, and Families. Significant differences in internal, external, and total behavioral problem scores were observed in favor of the supplemented formula group, as reported by parents (but not by teachers).  Immunity and gut health  MFGM bioactive protein components, including the glycoproteins lactadherin, MUC-1, and butyrophilin, have been shown in preclinical studies to affect immune response. These components influence the immune system by several mechanisms, including interference with microbe adhesion to intestinal epithelia, bacteriocidal action, support of beneficial microbiota, and modulation of other parts of the immune system. MFGM phospholipid components such as phosphatidylcholine are a key constituent of the intestinal mucus barrier, and therefore may contribute to intestinal defense against invasive pathogens. Sphingolipids, including sphingomyelin, are present in the apical membrane of the gut epithelia, and are also important for maintaining membrane structure, modulating growth factor receptors, and serving competitive binding inhibitors for microorganisms, microbial toxins, and viruses. Gangliosides are also present in intestinal mucosa and may possibly contribute to improved gut microflora and antibacterial defense. = Preclinical data = MFGM may be capable of modulating immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure is similar to that of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated inhibitory effects of MFGM against several pathogens. Both whole bovine MFGM and its extracted lipid components were found to exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus infectivity in vitro. Antibacterial effects of MFGM have included decreased gastric colonization and inflammation after H. pylori infection in mice; inhibition of shiga toxin gene expression by E. coli O157:H7; and decreased colonization and translocation of L. monocytogenes. Mice that were fed prophylactically with bovine whey glycoprotein fraction, including MFGM proteins, did not develop diarrhea after exposure to rotavirus. = Clinical data = The previously described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed the effects of MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM- supplemented group experienced a significant reduction in episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants‚Äô oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula. Zavaleta et al. (2011) evaluated the effects of an MFGM-enriched complementary food on health outcomes in term infants 6 to 11 months of age in Peru. In this double- blind RCT, 499 primarily breast-fed infants were fed for 6 months with a daily milk-based complementary food that included either whey protein concentrate enriched in MFGM, or an equal amount of additional protein from skim milk (control). Results showed that the group with the MFGM-supplemented diet had a significantly lower prevalence of diarrhea during the study compared to the control group (3.84% vs 4.37%; P<0.05), as well as a significant reduction (46%) in episodes of bloody diarrhea compared to the control group (P=0.025). Later through analyzing the metabolome and immune markers of those infants, Lee et al. (2018) reported that supplementation with MFGM may improve micronutrient status, amino acid, and energy metabolism along with a reduced proinflammatory response (e.g. interleukin-2). The previously described study by Veereman-Wauters et al. (2012) in preschool-age children (2.5 to 6 years old) also reported the effect of MFGM-supplemented formula consumption on health outcomes. Children receiving the MFGM-supplemented formula reported a significant reduction in the number of days with fever, and particularly the number of short febrile episodes (<3 days), compared to the control group.  Cardiovascular health  Dietary guidelines generally recommend limiting full-fat dairy products. This recommendation has been based on traditional hypothesis that dietary saturated fatty acids, such as those derived from milk fat, have serum LDL cholesterol raising effects. Subsequently, although not demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, serum LDL cholesterol has been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk based on observational evidence. A review of observational studies has suggested that the association between milk fat intake and serum cholesterol measures could vary depending on the type of dairy products. Differential effects of various dairy foods on plasma lipids might be partly dependent on the presence of MFGM. MFGM lipid components may play a role in supporting cardiovascular health by modulating cholesterol and fat uptake. = Preclinical data = MFGM lipid components such as sphingolipids are involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression. = Clinical data = Several clinical studies have shown that MFGM could positively affect circulating lipids. A single-blind RCT in overweight adults has shown that the effects of milk fat on plasma lipids were modulated by the MFGM content; compared to butter oil (control diet), consumption of whipping cream (MFGM diet) for 8 weeks did not impair the lipoprotein profile. Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double- blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of buttermilk rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure. MFGM supplementation in infancy is hypothesized to have programming effects that may influence circulating lipid levels later in life. Breastfed infants are known to have a higher total serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol than formula-fed infants in infancy, but lower levels in adulthood. A clinical study in infants has suggested that MFGM supplementation could narrow the gap between breastfed and formula-fed infants with regard to serum lipid status. Specifically, as compared with a control formula, infants receiving MFGM-supplemented formula had higher total serum cholesterol until 6 months of age, similar to breastfed infants. The LDL:HDL ratio did not differ between the formula-fed groups and was significantly higher in the breastfed reference group as compared with both formula-fed groups.

The group sophisticatedly utilizes social media as a tool for spreading its message and for international recruitment. The Islamic State is widely known for its posting of disturbing contents, such as beheading videos, on the internet. This propaganda is disseminated through websites and many social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and YouTube. By utilizing social media, the organization has garnered a strong following and successfully recruited tens of thousands of followers from around the world In response to its successful use of social media, many websites and social media platforms have banned accounts and removed content promoting the Islamic State from their platforms.  Target audience  ISIS targets a variety of different groups both in the Middle East and Western Countries. There are a wide variety of motives for why fighters may be prompted to join ISIS. Researches from Quantum cite nine attributes characteristic of a fighter looking to join ISIS: status seeking, identity seeking, revenge, redemption, thrill, ideology, justice, and death. The standard ISIS recruit, both from the Middle East and Western countries, is relatively young. The average age of ISIS fighters is around 26 years old, with 86% of recruits being male. Middle Eastern recruits come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in Northern Iraq. Recent destruction in the Iraq War and Syrian Civil War has created hatred of Western Powers in the region. thumb A member of ISIS waving the Flag Western recruits are often 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants. Computer scientists Zeeshan ul-hassan Usmani also found that the majority of the Western recruits don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúat home‚Äù in their home country. As a result, these fighters often have desires to go abroad and escape conditions in their home country. In addition to recruitment, ISIS's social media presence is also meant to intimidate and spread terror around the world. ISIS's posting of beheadings and other execution videos primarily target the Western world.  Content and messages  ISIS produces propaganda videos that range from video executions to full- length documentaries. The videos have a high production quality and incorporate montages, slow motion scenes, and are often accompanied by a short dialogue. ISIS has a dedicated team of over 100 media insurgents dedicated to recording these videos. The ISIS executions typically consist of beheadings or mass shootings in retaliation to western intervention in ISIS territory. The particular videos that ISIS often post include executions of ‚Äúenemies of the Caliphate,‚Äù which often consist of westerners or Jordanian nationals. Most infamously, an executioner named Jihadi John was seen in many of these videos prior to his death in 2015. Jihadi John is notorious for executing many US, UK, and Japanese citizens such as Steven Sotloff, David Haines, and Alan Henning. In many of the videos and materials produced by ISIS, there is the theme of inclusion and brotherhood. Additionally, the videos also focus on 3 main messages: # Convey Narrative of Global War and Ultimate Victory # Radicalize Populations Globally # Encourage international lone state actor and small cell attacks in support of ISIS These messages can be seen throughout all content produced by the Islamic State such as war documentaries, execution videos, and Rumiyah (magazine).  Social media usage  From 2013 to 2014, the organization primarily used mainstream platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. In 2014, these large social media platforms removed ISIS content. Since then, ISIS has chosen to utilize social media platforms that either protect their content or allow for content to quickly be reposted. These platforms of choice are Telegram, Justpaste.it, and Surespot. ISIS also implements marketing initiatives like ‚ÄúJihadist Follow Friday,‚Äù which encourages users to follow new ISIS-related accounts each Friday.Wright, Shaun; Denney, David; Pinkerton, Alasdair; Jansen, Vincent A.A.; Bryden, John (2016-05-17). \\"Resurgent Insurgents: Quantitative Research Into Jihadists Who Get Suspended but Return on Twitter\\". Journal of Terrorism Research. 7 (2). ISSN 2049-7040. doi:10.15664/jtr.1213. This specific hashtag mirrors commonly used hashtags such as #motivation monday or #throwbackthursday. To augment their online presence and popularity, the organization encourages their followers to use a plethora of Arabic hashtags, which translate to #theFridayofSupportingISIS, and #CalamityWillBefalltheUS. This allows them to gain followers each week while promoting their community and message on a weekly basis.Berger, Morgan (2015-03-05). \\"Defining and describing the population of ISIS supporters on Twitter\\". The Brookings Institution. Retrieved 2016-05-22.  Twitter  During 2014, there was an estimated 46,000 to 90,000 Twitter accounts that advocated for ISIS or were run by supporters of the group. In 2015, Twitter reported that it banned 125,000 ISIS sympathetic accounts.Koerner, Brendan I. ‚ÄúWhy ISIS Is Winning the Social Media War.‚Äù Wired, Conde Nast, 1 May 2017 In 2016, it published an update of 325,000 deleted accounts.Twitter Inc. ‚ÄúAn Update on Our Efforts to Combat Violent Extremism.‚Äù Twitter, Twitter, 18 Aug. 2016, blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2016/an-update-on-our-efforts-to-combat- violent-extremism.html. Though many accounts have been suspended, ISIS supporters often create new accounts. Twitter defines those who recreate accounts as ‚Äúresurgents‚Äù and explains that these are often difficult accounts to remove completely, since they tend to pop back up in alternate forms. It is estimated that approximately 20% of all ISIS affiliated Twitter accounts can be traced back to fake accounts created by the same user. Many of these accounts are traced back to the ‚ÄúBaqiya family,‚Äù which is an online network of thousands of ISIS followers. Many of these accounts are active during important ISIS military victories. During the ISIS march on Mosul, there were about 42,000 tweets on Twitter supporting the invasion.  Telegram  During 2014, ISIS became very active on Telegram after many major social media platforms banned ISIS content and sympathetic accounts. Telegram is an encrypted messaging application. The platform by nature is created as an end- to-end user encryption platform. Further, it also has special features such as the self-destruct timer which erase all evidence and messages. The app has a user data protection policy because violating this policy could potentially damage the app‚Äôs brand of customer privacy. Government agencies have been unable to break Telegram's encryption technology. On Telegram, ISIS often uses the hashtag #KhilafahNews to attract their users. Telegram is used by ISIS to plan social media campaigns on alternate platforms. The organization also uses Telegram as an anchor platform to connect with their user base when their other accounts are banned on Twitter and Facebook. On 28 February 2016 it was uploaded a video where they threaten to explose the najaasah and shoot the hesitates. Produced by Ibn-Altayb and distributed by Al-Hayat, the video shows footage of Bruxelles attacks and the victims. In July 2017, Telegram came under scrutiny from the media and news media outlets. It has been documented that ISIS gunmen have used this app to maintain contact with ISIS leaders in Raqqa days before terror attacks in Turkey, Berlin, and St. Petersburg. Despite concerns from Western media, there has been little to no action taken against ISIS accounts on Telegram. In April 2019 a video was uploaded in which they urged lone wolves to attempt to attack during the Holy Week in Sevilla and M√°laga. In Sevilla, a jihadist who intended to perform a lone wolf attack was arrested.  TikTok  In October 2019, it was reported that ISIS recruitment content was discovered on TikTok. Approximately two dozen accounts were subsequently shut down in response.  Justpaste.it  Justpaste.it, an anonymous photo and text sharing website, has also been utilized heavily. With the option to lock images, the website allows anonymous users to send and receive content without registration. For this reason, ISIS members have shared photos of countless murders, executions, and battlegrounds onto the app to be disseminated to other applications. There have been calls to shut down the site to prevent its usage by ISIS or other extremist groups. However, founder Mariusz ≈ªurawek has resisted doing so. He stated, \\"I do not want to interfere with any type of conflict and stay on one side. Justpaste.it has many users. I cannot focus on a single group. I don‚Äôt see any reason why they should shut down the service. Should they shut down Twitter, too?\\" In 2014, Justpaste.it removed graphic content from the website‚Äîthis prompted ISIS to launch their own content-sharing pages. These sites included Manbar.me in 2014, Nasher.me in January 2015, and Alors.ninja, in July 2015. ISIS social media offices relied most heavily on Manbar.me to distribute propaganda photos of battles and city raids. In 2016, ISIS introduced PasteMaker and Sharetext, which mirrored the encrypted messages of Justpaste.it. Despite creating their own platforms periodically, they were considerably more difficult to navigate; thus ISIS returned to using Justpaste.it.  The Dawn of Glad Tidings - Smartphone Application  ISIS created The Dawn of Glad Tidings, an Arabic Language application. This app shares many of the tweets, pictures, and videos from ISIS sympathetic Twitter accounts. Additionally, it allowed users to see and monitor hashtags, tweets, images, videos, and comments that were posted on their accounts. The application was originally intended for ISIS followers to have a private online forum to communicate. This app was downloaded several hundred times on the Google Play app store before being taken down.  Offline impact  As the November 2015 attacks in Paris demonstrate, ISIS also resorts to old-fashioned methods of communication and propaganda. Lewis notes that the attacks in Paris represent a 'propaganda of the deed', a method developed by 19th century anarchists in Europe. The November 2015 ISIS attacks were perpetrated without prior warning, largely because the operatives met face-to-face and used other non-digital means of communication. Additionally, it is common for ISIS to claim responsibility of many terror attacks around the world such as the Paris Attacks, the Pulse night club shooting, and the Las Vegas attack.  Usage of the dark web  ISIS‚Äôs activities on the surface web are subject to scrutiny and regulations by corporations, government agencies, and hackers. ISIS has been forced to look for a new online safe haven. ISIS also posts a variety of content on the Dark Web. The Dark Web is untraceable and provides complete anonymity to both the viewer and the original poster. They also actively publish a variety of their content on the dark web as well as their own internally generated platforms.Bertrand, Natasha. ‚ÄúISIS Is Taking Full Advantage of the Darkest Corners of the Internet.‚Äù Business Insider, Business Insider, 11 July 2015 ISIS's usage of dark web has made anti-terrorism work more difficult. Using the dark web, ISIS has made their own platform to increase their ability to spread their message. Without the intervention of corporate actors or government entities, ISIS has been able to freely spread their messages on their own platforms and websites. In 2017, Europol, the European Police, was able to uncover 52 unique online ISIS networks on the dark web. These 52 unique networks contained over 2,000 unique extremist items.  Relevant impact of the ISIS social media usage  ISIS social media posts have mobilized ordinary citizens throughout the world and other radical jihadists groups to act upon their digitized demands. Their methods have worked to effectively recruit younger individuals to join their groups in a consolidated setting. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube are more impressionable mediums, especially on a younger demographic. For this reason, ISIS strategically places their polished messages on these platforms to attract potential new members from an early age.Awan, Imran. ‚ÄúCyber-Extremism: ISIS and the Power of Social Media.‚Äù Social Science and Public Policy. A study about the repercussions of social media demonstrated that there were approximately 1,264 cases that could be categorized as ‚Äúviolent-inciting‚Äù examples; in these cases, ISIS social media experts have deliberately posted threatening propaganda to provoke offline aggression. Many ‚Äúcall for action‚Äù verbs that have a positive connotation have also been utilized to establish feelings of justification towards any pertinent violence.  Critiques of movement and backlash  Both national governments and corporations have taken a stand against ISIS in both the physical and virtual spheres. The U.S. Department of State announced an international coalition in 2014, in which they list five lines of effort to expose ISIS. They include: * Providing military support to partners * Impeding the flow of foreign fighters * Stopping financing and funding * Addressing humanitarian crises in the region * Exposing true nature‚ÄúThe Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS.‚Äù U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of State, 10 Sept. 2014, . Companies are also taking action to hinder ISIS social media recruitment attempts. Google‚Äôs ThinkTank, Jigsaw, launched a collaboration with YouTube in July, 2017 to redirect any potential recruits using the Redirect Method.Snider, Mike. ‚ÄúYouTube Redirects ISIS Recruits to Anti-Terrorist Videos.‚Äù USA Today, Gannett Satellite Information Network, July 20, 2017. After facing growing pressure from the government leaders, Facebook announced that the company is using Artificial Intelligence to detect terrorism related contents, their effort would extend to other Facebook owned platforms such as WhatsApp. ‚ÄúThe Redirect Method uses Adwords targeting tools and curated YouTube videos uploaded by people all around the world to confront online radicalization. It focuses on the slice of ISIS‚Äô audience that is most susceptible to its messaging, and redirects them towards curated YouTube videos debunking ISIS recruiting themes. This open methodology was developed from interviews with ISIS defectors, respects users‚Äô privacy and can be deployed to tackle other types of violent recruiting discourses online.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Redirect Method.‚Äù The Redirect Method, redirectmethod.org/. By using this tactic, Jigsaw catches slogans that manifest any positive ISIS sentiments, like \\"Baqiyah wa Tatamadad\\" (Remaining and Expanding), and \\"Al Dawla Al Islameyah,\\" which includes ‚Äúal-Dawla,‚Äù a sign of respect. Lastly, Anonymous declared war against ISIS in November 2015, attempting to thwart the social media recruitment efforts by targeting ISIS's communication networks.Cohen, Paula. ‚ÄúAnonymous Hackers' Group Declares War on ISIS.‚Äù CBS News, CBS, 16 Nov. 2015, www.cbsnews.com/news/anonymous-hackers-declare-war-on-isis/.

Winning no less than 47 gold medals, she has been described as the most successful Spanish-speaking actress of the 19th century, on a par with Eleonora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt. Biography Born on 28 August 1860 in Cienfuegos, Luisa Mart√≠nez Casado Mu√±oz was the daughter of the writer, theatre and newspaper owner, Luis Mart√≠nez Casado, and his wife Guadalupe Mu√±oz. She had three elder sisters and two younger brothers. Thanks to her father, when she was only six years old, she appeared on the stage reciting La vaquera de la Finojosa. In 1868, the family moved to Havana where Mart√≠nez Casado appeared in El gorri√≥n, a play written by her father. As she grew older, she appeared in an ever-wider variety of plays, together with established actors including Ceferino Guerra, Julio G. Segarra, Ana Su√°rez Peraza and Elo√≠sa Ag√ºero. It is believed Enrique Zumel's Laura (1864) was written specially for her. In 1876 she performed in Mexico where she was reported to have been \\"inimitable\\". On her return to Cuba in July 1877, still just 17, she played Dorotea in Pancho Fern√°ndez' Los negros catedr√°ticos. and appeared in Jos√© E. Triay's Cervantes in memory of the author of Don Quijote. In September 1878, Mart√≠nez Casado was admitted to the Madrid Royal Conservatory where she studied under Concepci√≥n Sanpelayo, Florencio Romea and Matilde Diez. She was such a talented student that she completed the four-year course of study in just six months, receiving the conservatory's first prize for tragedy, comedy and drama. In December 1878, she performed in Spain in a work written for her by Jos√© Echegaray titled Mar sin orillas. She continued to perform to wide acclaim in Madrid and the provinces over the next five years. When she was 28, she returned to Cuba for a short period, signed a contract with the theatrical empresario Leopoldo Bur√≥n, and in 1888 went on to Mexico City where she appeared at the Teatro Arbeu, receiving standing ovations and countless bouquets. President Porfirio D√≠az even invited her to the presidential palace while his wife presented her with gifts including a jewelry box with over 30 jewels. After touring the Mexican provinces, she returned to the capital in 1889, appearing this time at the Teatro El Nacional. On 1 January 1891, Mart√≠nez Casado married Isaac Puga, an actor she had met in Spain and who had travelled to meet her in Cuba. Together they had four children. The same year she returned to Spain, broke off her contract with Bur√≥n and created her own theatrical company bearing her name. Over the next 20 years, she performed with her company in Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Santo Domingo, Panama, Costa Rica and Venezuela, earning more than three million peso, a veritable fortune. In 1910, now aged 50, Mart√≠nez Casado established the Sociedad para el Fomento del Teatro, a foundation aimed at encouraging Cuban authors to write plays and revive past Cuban theatrical works. In 1911, following the death of her husband, Mart√≠nez Casado retired from the stage, giving her last performance in C√°rdenas where she played in Locura de amor by Manuel Tamayo y Baus. On 28 September 1925, Luisa Mart√≠nez Casado died in her home town of Cienfuegas.

The Bluejacket 23 is a Canadian fibreglass monohull sailboat designed by Cuthbertson & Cassian (C&C; Designs) as a day sailer and club racer and first built in 1967. Production The boat was built by Paceship Yachts in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. It was first offered in 1967 in the Daysailer version, with a roomy cockpit and an open cuddy (cabin). By 1970 it was also offered in the MORCEE version, a modification of the original design, which was adapted to comply with the Midget Ocean Racing Club Rule (MORC) by fitting a self-bailing cockpit and enclosing the cabin. A total of at least 107 boats were produced (including both versions, based on known hulls) between 1967 and 1974. It is now out of production. Design The Paceship Bluejacket 23 is a small recreational keelboat. It has a fractional rig, a spade rudder, and a fixed fin keel. The boat has a draft of . It displaces and carries of iron ballast. The Bluejacket 23 has a theoretical hull speed of . The design of the Bluejacket 23 is very similar to several other Cuthbertson & Cassian designs built in Ontario around the same time, including the Classic 22 by Grampian Marine (which predated the Bluejacket), and the Viking 22 and later Gazelle 22 from Ontario Yachts. (Paceship) Bluejacket 23 Daysailer sailboat at anchor on the Bras d'Or Lake. Hull and deck The hull, deck and interior liners are integrally molded of multi-laminate fiberglass construction, built by the hand-layup method using polyester resins, mat and roving throughout the boat. Positive flotation is provided by large blocks of foam contained inside the cockpit seats and in the bow. A non-skid pattern is molded into deck and cockpit surfaces. There are two fixed lights in the cabin top for visibility and interior illumination. The deck is reinforced with plywood that is sandwiched into the laminate. All hardware is either bolted through or tapped into metal which is bonded into the laminate. =Interior liner (Daysailer only)= The Daysailer interior liner is a one piece moulding. It is not integral with the deck. No self-bailing is provided in this model. It is recommended that a boom-tent be used to reduce the amount of rain water getting into the boat. A bilge pump would also be a useful extra. =Interior liner (MORCEE version)= The MORCEE has a self-bailing cockpit with the cockpit an integral part of the deck. The cuddy cabin is enclosed with a hatch slide arrangement. The liner in the cabin is a separate moulding and contains two berth cushions and a sink. Keel The fin keel is of cast iron with a double resin coating to prevent corrosion and is of a hydrodynamic design supplying maximum lift with good stability. The keel is mounted to the hull and has a separate moulded keel grid that provides greater strength in this area. The keel is attached with stainless steel flat head bolts, nuts and flat washers. No gasket is used to mount the keel as the mating surfaces are well matched. Keels are mounted at the factory using a silicone marine sealer between the keel and hull. Rudder The rudder is a spade type made of fiberglass with a brass rudder stock. The rudder port is a bronze tube with bushings top and bottom. Steering is by tiller. The tiller head is cast bronze and is held on with a pin. This pin passes horizontally through the head and stock. An allen screw locks into a key in the rudder stock. The tiller is straight grained ash. The rudder can be rotated a full 360 degrees if needed. Deck hardware Fully equipped for sailing, the Bluejacket 23 has deck hardware of stainless steel, Marinium and chromed brass. Fiberglass winch bases mount two No.1 snubbing winches used for headsail sheeting. Mast and boom The anodized aluminum deck stepped mast and boom are aluminum type 6351 alloy and have integral sail slots and non-geared roller reefing. Standing and running rigging Standing rigging is 1 x 19 stainless steel wire rope (breaking strength ) with swage terminals, stainless steel turnbuckles and chain plates. Running rigging is of Samson braid, including jib sheets and main sheet. Halyards are stainless steel having dacron rope tails. Sails This yacht comes equipped with a mainsail as well as a working jib as standard equipment. A No. 1 Genoa and a Spinnaker are optional. Outboard motor well The lazarette contains a built in outboard well, which includes access hatch and well plug. This well is bulkheaded off from the main hull and is of the self-draining, non-filling type. There is an access door through the bulkhead for outboard operation [recommended 3 - 6 H.P. (not supplied)]. A shelf for gasoline tanks and a well plug that fairs the well opening in the hull for racing is supplied. Like most outboard wells, it is possible to take water in under some operating conditions. The following procedure is recommended to minimize this problem: #Remove the motor from the well when sailing. This will reduce drag and contribute to better sailing qualities. #Install the plug insert. This will keep much of the water out of the well. #Remove the drain plug from the forward part of the motor well box. This will allow any water to drain out. When under power, decide on conditions if the plug is best left in or out. Trim All wood trim is No. 1 grade, oiled teak and includes hand rails on cabin, cabin trim, cockpit trim and rub rails. The tiller is straight grained ash. Accommodations Cabin (MORCEE Model Only) The cabin is fully enclosed and has two fixed lights in the cabin top for visibility and interior illumination. The companionway closes with teak hatch slides. Forward a double V berth is raised a few inches above the cabin sole and is fitted with two 3\\" foam cushions in a choice of colours.

History Origin 15 Reception Depot (15 RCD) was activated on 10 September 1939 to muster South African volunteers signing up to take part in World War 2, it operated as the reception depot to service the then Witwatersrand Command.http://sadf.info/UnitArmyPersonnelGeneral.html The depot drew its recruits mainly from Johannesburg and the immediate surrounds. UDF era and World War II The depot operated from the Milner Park Showgrounds and the Wanderers Grounds in Johannesburg. The unit was also responsible for the routing and demobilisation of returning South African Union Defence Force (UDF) soldiers until it was disbanded after the Second World War on 31 December 1945. . SADF era and the Bush War The unit was reactivated on 29 April 1964 owing to the threat of a United Nations action in respect of South West Africa, and in case such a situation required the mobilisation of South African Army Citizen Force units. When the threat subsided, the unit was retained to process the bi-annual national service intake of white South African conscripts drawn from the greater Witwatersrand area. The government policy of compulsory conscription preceding 1994 was exclusively for young ‚Äòwhite‚Äô South African men. Men of ‚Äòblack‚Äô South African heritage at the time were recruited into the South African Army on a voluntary basis and joined ethnically differentiated Battalions directly as 'Permanent Force' members. 15 Reception Depot was one of a number of Reception Depots around South Africa which was tasked to the intake of national service conscripts into the South African Defence Force (SADF). Each Regional Command in the SADF structure had its own Reception Depot. Due to the population size of the Witwatersrand region and resultant intake size, 15 RCD spearheaded the drafting process. The reception depot units fell under the Personnel Services Corps (PSC) of the SADF. To mobilise these 'white' South African conscripted troops, duties and tasks performed by 15 RCD involved: * the registering of young white males at high schools * the issuing of call-up papers * confirmation of the recruits arrival * logistics surrounding mustering locations * public relations and media relations * intelligence gathering as to anti-conscription protests and threats * the transport of these recruits to various allotted training units * security operations surrounding the mustering stations and convoys of recruits in transit to their respective training bases 15 Reception Depot HQ was stationed at the Witwatersrand Command's Drill Hall in downtown Johannesburg until the Drill Hall was bombed on 30 July 1987 by a lone Umkhonto we Sizwe insurgent, Hein Grosskopf. The explosion injured 26 people (a mix of both military personnel and by-standing civilians) with no deaths, the building was however deemed unsafe and 15 Reception Depot's HQ moved into a high rise building adjacent to the Drill Hall. 15 Reception Depot initially conducted the bi-annual intake of national servicemen from Sturrock Park railway station in Johannesburg and escorted these recruits to their respective army training units by train, this intake of conscripts was later moved to the Nasrec Expo centre show grounds and the majority of national servicemen recruits were convoyed to their training units in busses. During early 1994, 15 Reception Depot became involved in the mustering of members of the SADF's reserve. SADF Army numbers needed boosting by trained SADF conscripts ahead of South Africa's first fully democratic election. During these General Elections which were held between 26 and 29 April 1994, these SADF Reservists were called to maintain national security at the election stations themselves and the secure transfer of ballot boxes for counting. SANDF era From April 1994, the unit was initially involved in the integration of non-statutory forces members into the newly reformatted South African National Defence Force (SANDF). The first multiracial intakes also occurred in 1994 through the Voluntary Military Service (VMS) System. Mustering at this time of VMS recruits was coordinated by 15 RCD at the Nasrec show grounds. After 1994 Witwatersrand Command was re- designated as Gauteng Command, and the Command along with 15 Reception Depot HQ was moved to Group 18 located at Doornkop military base. By the early 2000s, Commands were no longer responsible for individual recruitment, making Reception Depots essentially redundant.http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/21062/Transformational%20leadership%20in%20the%20SANDF.pdf?sequence=1  Leadership  15 RCD Commanding Officers Capt J.W.

He currently lives and works in Moscow.  Biography  He graduated from the Lyceum of Animation Cinematography (2004), the Moscow Institute of Journalism and Literature, Department of Journalism and Photography (2009), and the Rodchenko Moscow School of Photography and Multimedia where he studied at Igor Mukhin's studio in 2010‚Äì2013. Evgeny Granilshchikov's works belong to various media including video and sound art, photography, installation, and independent cinema. In many of his projects artist explores questions of his own generation as well as themes of personal and political frustrations. Bohemia (2009‚Äì2011) and Insomnia (2011) photo series are the first two projects completed by Granilshchikov. Artist's thesis became a three-channel film Positions, which, directly referring to Jean-Luc Godard‚Äôs film La Chinoise (1967), depicts personal and political search of the three young citizens of Moscow. For this work, Granilshchikov became winner of the Kandinsky Prize in nomination \\"New Artist. Project of the Year\\" in 2013. In 2013‚Äì2014 artist's works were on display at the cycle of shows High Hopes, organized by the Museum of Screen Culture Manege  MediaArtLab in cooperation with Triumph Gallery (Moscow), hosted by the Manege Central Exhibition Hall. In 2014, Granilshchikov's film Courbet's Funeral was screened as part of the 4th Moscow International Biennale for Young Art, which went by the theme A Time for Dreams and was curated by David Elliott. The film was also featured in the main programme of the Kino Der Kunst festival in Munich and was listed among best artworks of year 2014, according to aroundart.org journal on contemporary art. The film was shot using a smartphone and comprised found videos, both documentary and production footage. In 2015, Unfinished Film (2015) by Evgeny Granilshchikov was screened during the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen and goEast Festival of Central and Eastern European Film, where it won the OPEN FRAME AWARD. The film was also shortlisted in nomination \\"New Generation\\" of the Innovation Prize-2014, the 10th all-Russian competition in contemporary art. Artist's films are characterized by a non-linear structure and absence of a particular storyline; characters are often played by director's friends who wander around the city, discussing personal topics, criticizing current social and political situation and possible actions within this context. \\"A direct point of view, medium-shot, but more often a long shot, the interspersing of long and short episodes, an uneven rhythm,\\" describes Granilshchikov himself. \\"In this film, there is no classical narrative, as if it has been assembled from chance scenes which have no unambiguous links between them. We never find out where the characters are going, what their aims are, but we see how an implicit feeling of alarm is hidden behind all their simple actions and movements.\\" Together with the short video Untitled (reenactment), works Courbet's Funeral and Unfinished Film form a trilogy that, according to artist's own words, can be interpreted as \\"a reenactment of the everyday life of the noughties.\\" The next film by Granilshchikov, To Follow Her Advice, which was shot in Thailand, was on display in 2015 as part of the main programme of the 6th Moscow Biennale, opened under the theme How to Gather? Acting in a Center in a City in the Heart of the Island of Eurasia (curated by Bart De Baere, Defne Ayas, and Nicolaus Schafhausen). In 2016, Multimedia Art Museum (Moscow) organized artist's solo show Untitled (after defeats), curated by Andrey Misiano and Anna Zaytseva, which presented the polaroid series Untitled (accidental shots), videos Munich (2015), Empire (2016), and Ghost movie (2016). Same year this exhibition entered the finals of the Kandinsky Prize in nomination \\"Project of the Year.\\" In 2016, Granilshchikov's project War (untitled), first screened as part of the show One Within The Other. Art of New and Old Media in the Age of High-speed Internet in the Moscow Museum of Contemporary Art, was shortlisted in nomination \\"New Generation\\" of the Innovation Prize 2015. In 2013‚Äì2015 Granilshchikov was also entitled to the scholarship provided by Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, as part of the institutional programme for support of young artists.

The album is an intimate song cycle centred on the romantic break-up of frontman Bobby Wratten and Anne Mari Davies, his former bandmate in The Field Mice and Northern Picture Library. After writing several songs about the break-up in early 1995 that Wratten believed to be messy, he discarded them, but engineer and musician Ian Catt persuaded him to record material based on the break-up in his own studios in Mitcham, South London, over the subsequent autumn and winter. Musically, Her Handwriting blends indie pop and electronic music, and features dreamy guitars and ambient textures. The album was named after a lyric from the Go-Betweens and was promoted with the single \\"Abba on the Jukebox\\" ahead of the album's release, one of the less direct songs on the album, which was greeted with critical acclaim. Similar acclaim met the album when it was released the following month. Melody Maker later named it one of the year's best albums, and LTM Recordings re-released it in a new remastered with bonus tracks in 2006. Background and recording During the later days of indie pop group The Field Mice, frontman and songwriter Robert \\"Bobby\\" Wratten and backing singer Anne Mari Davies, already musical partners in the group, formed a romantic relationship just before that group disbanded in 1991; their last album, For Keeps, documented the start of their personal relationship. The couple formed Northern Picture Library in 1993, a band which former Field Mice drummer Mark Dobson soon joined, which moved the couple into a dub-influenced dream pop direction that nonetheless retained the jangle pop guitar sound from the Field Mice. Primarily studio-only artists at this point, Davies began suffering from stage fright, strong enough to make live performances impossible for her, and in some of the band's contemporary material, Wratten and Davies had begun questioning their relationship. Soon after, the couple split up, both romantically and as musical collaborators, thus also ending Northern Picture Library. In the spring of 1995, a heartbroken Wratten, who had always used real life scenarios as inspiration for his songs, began writing his own songs about the break-up with the idea to release them as a mini-album under the new band name of Trembling Blue Stars for Sarah Records, but he found the songs to be \\"pretty much a mess. In the words of band biographer Michael Hill, \\"[Wratten] found himself unable to commit his feelings onto tape after giving it a couple of unsuccessful tries.\\" Saint Etienne collaborator and engineer and long-time friend of Wratten, Ian Catt, persuaded Wratten to record in the studio Catt had created in his parents' home in Mitcham, South London, within easy reach of Wratten's home. On 31 October 1995, Wratten recorded the first song for Her Handwriting at the studio, \\"Do People Ever?\\", alongside the eventual outtake \\"Less than Love\\", which was unreleased until the album's 2006 remastered version. Hill later reflected: \\"These were encouraging signs for Wratten. Working became cathartic, not debilitating. He was emboldened to write and develop material he had earlier feared he'd not be able to approach in any objective way, examining the circumstances of his breakup from every possible angle.\\" The rest of the album was recorded at the studio between November 1995 and January 1996, mostly as a collaboration between Wratten and Catt, though Harvey Williams, Wratten's ex-Field Mice bandmate, played guitar on \\"Last Summertime's Obsession\\" and \\"For This One\\". He had composed the latter song and \\"A London Story\\" when Northern Picture Library were still active. Wratten also invited Davies to appear on the album, though she declined. Davies did however make a guest appaearance on Trembling Blue Stars' second album Lips That Taste of Tears (1998), which lyrically continues the heartbreak themes of Her Handwriting. Music and lyrics Folk singer Jackson Browne (pictured in 2005) was an influence on Her Handwriting. Her Handwriting bridges together styles of indie pop and electronic music in a fashion that Michael Edwards of Exclaim felt \\"was a natural progression from the electronic experimentation of Northern Picture Library.\\" The melancholic album incorporates pastoral, dreamy guitars and a muted ambient atmosphere, with \\"lush\\" electronics that have been compared to Saint Etienne. The record also bears the musical influence of Jackson Browne, especially in its usage of folk rock touches, elegant piano riffs and arrangements which build towards \\"heart-wrenching\\" musical and emotional crescendos, similarly to Browne's Late for the Sky (1974); Wratten even uses a lyrical snippet from Browne's \\"Sky Blue and Black\\" (\\"the far too simple beauty\\") on the song with the same name. With its lyrics centred on Wratten and Davies' breakup, Her Handwriting has been described as an intimate song cycle. In the liner notes of the album's re-release, journalist Michael Hill compared the confessional lyrics of Her Handwriting to Joni Mitchell's Blue: \\"so startlingly specific in its narratives that one could practically retrace Bobby and Anne Mari's steps from the lyrical clues contained in a song like 'Abba on the Jukebox.' Yet, as with Mitchell, Wratten's work didn't feel unduly self-absorbed, just remarkably frank. He made palpable the joys and terrors of falling in - and out - of love. The details made his songs feel more authentic and compelling, familiar to anyone who's ever longed for another, especially someone determined to remain out of reach.\\" The seven- minute \\"Abba on the Jukebox\\" contains chintzy drum machine beats, a brief, high-toned guitar phrase and sighing backing vocals, with lyrics solely comprising a list of memories spent with a partner. Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger said of the song's lyrics: \\"What Rob Wratten discovered with the Field Mice is that if you say something plainly enough, your words work harder and you can give the most ordinary phrases the emotional weight of novels. [‚Ä¶] What he discovered with 'Abba on the Jukebox' is that you didn‚Äôt even have to go that far ‚Äì what makes this song so poignant is that the loss between the lines, the knowledge that these things he's describing can't ever return or be remade, goes unmentioned.\\" Jason Ankeny of AllMusic wrote that the song \\"easily captures the evocative grandeur of its title,\\" while also highlighting \\"For This One\\" as shimmering \\"with breathtaking loveliness.\\" Release and reception Released in May 1996, Her Handwriting was the first album released on Shinkansen Recordings, an indie label newly established by Matt Haynes after retiring Sarah Records after 100 releases; an edited version of \\"Abba on the Jukebox\\" had been released as a single to critical acclaim the previous month. The album title references the lyric \\"that's her handwriting, that's the way she writes\\" from the Go-Between's song \\"Part Company\\" from their album Spring Hill Fair (1984). Wratten explained: \\"There was a couple of things on there that it is referencing. One is the Go Betweens which I like. It was also a nice name for the record as it was break up record.\\" The album packaging is somewhat ambiguous with its lack of production credits or recording information; Hill later reflected: Her Handwriting was released to unanimous acclaim from music critics. Melody Maker and NME featured pieces on the band, and the band were also invited by Mark Radcliffe to record a session for his BBC Radio 1 show on 2 July 1996. Vox compared the album's mood to Massive Attack's collaborations with Tracy Thorn, and hailed the album as one \\"with which to grow old and sad gracefully,\\" while Mike Sutherland of the NME wrote that \\"Wratten's trademark blend of pastoral guitars and lush, Saint Etienne- esque electronics is fine-tuned to near perfection and even the hardest hearts find themselves whispering along to 'What Can I Say To Change Your Heart?'.\\" The success turned Trembling Blue Stars from a one-off project into a fully fledged band; however, American journalist Michael Hill noted that, despite the great reviews, the album was a \\"success d'estime\\" at the time of its release, being commercially unsuccessful but slowly gaining a cult following via word of mouth praise. In a retrospective review, rating the album four stars out of five, Jason Ankeny of AllMusic highlighted the album as an \\"Album Pick\\", saying \\"few artists bare their souls quite so beautifully as Wratten, and the 14 tracks which make up Trembling Blue Stars' debut rank among his most sublime to date.\\" He wrote that the album \\"possesses a stately elegance which allows Wratten to dangle on the brink of romantic despair but never allows him or his songs to lose their dignity.\\" Michael Edwards of Exclaim! was favourable, saying \\"[w]hen it comes to break-up albums, it would be hard to imagine a more comprehensive one than Her Handwriting.\\" He felt the songs' document the end of Wratten's relationship \\"in a way that had to be cathartic for Wratten or else he would never have recorded such personal moments for the entire world to hear. It never crosses the line into self-indulgence even though there are times where it can make for uncomfortable listening.\\" Melody Maker ranked the album at number 23 in their list of the 50 best albums of 1996.rocklistmusic.co.uk/mmlists_p2.htm#1996 \\"Abba on the Jukebox\\" was ranked number 19 in the 1996 edition of John Peel's Festive Fifty, an annual listeners' poll of the best songs of the year, and in 1999, Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger ranked it at number 15 in his list of the \\"Top 100 Singles of the 90s,\\" who called it \\"a coming-to-terms: the song's litany of places, snapshot moments and tiny private actions is a way to map out a love by looking at its edges, to understand the shape of something too bright and raw for direct inspection.\\" The album has been seen as influential; Edwards reflected that, \\"[a]lways ahead of his time, [Wratton] was bringing together indie pop and electronic music before it was cool to do so,\\" while Hill posed Give Up (2003) by The Postal Service as a \\"direct descendant\\" of Her Handwriting.

The genus contains three described species, Linguamyrmex brevicornis, Linguamyrmex rhinocerus, and the type species Linguamyrmex vladi all known from Late Cretaceous fossils found in Asia. History and classification Linguamyrmex is known from a total of four adult fossils. The holotype is specimen number \\"AMNH BuPH-01\\" from the American Museum of Natural History; the other three specimens described are also in the same collection, but were not placed as members of L. vladi. The described specimens are of worker caste adults which have been preserved as inclusions in transparent chunks of Burmese amber. The amber specimens were recovered from deposits in Kachin State, in Myanmar. Burmese amber has been radiometrically dated using U-Pb isotopes, yielding an age of approximately 98.79 ¬± 0.62 million years old, close to the Albian ‚Äì Cenomanian boundary, in the earliest Cenomanian. The fossils were first studied by paleoentomologists Phillip Barden and David Grimaldi with their 2017 type description of the new genus and species being published in the journal Systematic Entomology. The genus name Linguamyrmex was formed as a combination of the Greek \\"myrmex\\" which means ant, and the Latin \\"lingua\\", which means tongue, as a reference to the shape and appearance of the clypeal projection. The specific epithet vladi is a patronym honoring Vlad III, known as Vlad the Impaler, who was the ruler of Wallachia. It was coined as a reference to both Vlad's preferred execution style and for his inspiration of Bram Stoker's Count Dracula, who drank blood. The three remaining workers studied, BuPH-02, BuPH-03, and BuPH-04 were assigned to Linguamyrmex due to several factors. Each of the specimens is incomplete, all missing portions of the antennae, making comparison of the scape length to the other segments impossible, and all specimens are missing the terminal segments of the gaster. Based on the worker size and on paddle composition Barden and Grimaldi suggest the three workers may belong to undescribed species. Linguamyrmex is one of several ant genera described from Burmese amber, the others being Burmomyrma, Camelomecia, Ceratomyrmex, Gerontoformica, Haidomyrmex, Myanmyrma, and Zigrasimecia. Linguamyrmex is one of five genera in Haidomyrmecini, the other four being Ceratomyrmex, Haidomyrmex, Haidomyrmodes and Haidoterminus. The genus is distinguished from them by the well developed gasteral constriction on the abdomen, a feature only seen, to a lesser degree, in Haidomyrmodes mammuthus. Additionally Linguamyrmex has an enlarged and paddle shaped clypeus, similar to the extremely modified clypeus of Ceratomyrmex, but which is smooth along the stalk instead of sporting setae, and with trigger hairs placed at the base of the setae pad on the paddle instead of at the base of the paddle stalk. Behavior and ecology Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri head As with all haidomyrmecine members, the head structure of Linguamyrmex is interpreted to facilitate trap-jaw behavior, as is seen in modern specialized genera of Formicinae, Myrmicinae and Ponerinae. In haidomyrmecines the clypeus is modified to span from near the oral opening up past the mandibles to near the vertex of the head, the only ant group with such a modification. Along with the clypeal structuring a pair of long setae are positioned in the path of the mandibles. In modern trap-jaw ants such setae are used as triggers that initiate the rapid closure of the mandibles, often to capture prey or sometimes in a defensive action. The upper areas of the clypeus are always coated in a brush of stout setae in the region where the mandibles came to rest when triggered to close. Based on the modification of the clypeus, it is probable that Linguamyrmex would have captured prey from the front, other strategies being made improbable due to the upward motion of the mandibles. In haidomyrmecines with highly modified cleypeal areas, such as Linguamyrmex and Ceratomyrmex the horn probably served as a pinning or trapping point for the mandibles with captured prey. This hypothesis for the purpose of the clypeus in Linguamyrmex is further supported by data obtained from X-ray micro-computed tomography scans of specimen \\"BuPH-03\\". Scanning of the specimen shows density variation in the paddle, with the outer edges less dense than the central core area on the paddles underside. This indicates the paddle was strengthened with thickened cuticle or with metals sequestering in the cuticle, the latter being more likely from the distinct contrast shown in the x-ray. The location of the highest density is near the center of the paddle at the point of impact for the mandibles when they closed, likely to help brace the paddle against misfires of the mandibles, or impact through soft bodied prey, such as beetle larvae. Metals such as calcium, iron, manganese, and zinc are used by insects in both mandibles and ovipositors to reduce wear and increase durability. Description Head of the holotype worker The head of the Linguamyrmex holotype measures from the front edge of the clypeus to the rear of the head at the occipital foramen, which is placed high on the back side, near the vertex. There are three ocelli placed just to the front of the vertex, and the bulging ovoid compound eyes are positioned high on the head capsule. The antennae are not fully preserved, with only three full segments, the scape, pedicel, and flagellomere I. The antennae insertion is just in front of and below the eyes, positioned in depressions on each side of the frontal triangle. The frontal triangle extends down from the vertex and merges with the base of the clypeal horn, which is reinforced with clear membrane-like cuticle. The clypeus is enlarged and modified into a paddle shaped horn that has a pad of setae on the underside. The stalk of the horn is smooth, with no setae, and the trigger hairs seen in haidomyrmecines sprout from near the base of the setae pad on the paddle. The pad is composed of long fine setae around the edges changing to shorter thicker setae in the center. The mandibles scythe shaped in general outline, curving out and upwards from the head towards the clypeal horn. There are expansions near the base of each mandible which angle in towards each other, and which have upper surfaces that are concave and covered with setae pointing towards the mouth. Linguamyrmex brevicornis Dorsal The mesosoma has a small propleuron that is hidden except where the mesosoma touches the head capsule, while the pronotum is broad and has a coating of fine setae. To the rear of the mesosoma, the propodeum is gently rounded upper front face that curves to become a shear rear face. Both the propodeal spiracle and metapleural gland are visible on the sides of the mesosoma, with the spiracle elongated into a slit shape, while metapleural gland is a horizontal opening placed rear of a well- developed bulla. The petiole has a gradually sloping front face and rounded upper surface. The rear is broadly attached to gasteral segment I and the distinctly showing helcium is striated. An incomplete fusion line runs along the side of the petiole and gaster, with a thin membranous section present below, while a constriction between segments I and II that rings the full gaster. There is a forward projecting horn on the underside of sternite III that also has distinct striations. The cuticle of the gaster is translucent, which shows that the apodemes of gastral sternites IV and V are expanded and heavily sclerotized.

In 2009, he was an external student at The Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA Moscow). In the years 2004‚Äì5, Dolgov was involved in the Voronezh-based artistic groups Border Investigations together with co-members Arseny Zhilyaev, Maria Chekhonadskikh, Nikolay Alekseev, Ivan Gorshkov and Alexander Sinozersky and Popular Border Investigations. In 2008, together with Nikolay Alekseev, Ivan Gorshkov and Arseny Zhilyaev, he co-founded the Voronezh Center of Contemporary Art (VCCA). Dolgov‚Äôs first solo show took place at the ‚ÄúEnergiya‚Äù Sport Center, a venue of VCCA. It was titled Utopia Is What You Need But You Is Not What Utopia Has Need For and demonstrated Dolgov‚Äôs interest in the ‚Äúcontemporary utopian project of trans-humanism, the optics of utopian desire and the subjectivities it derives from‚Äù. In 2009, Dolgov‚Äôs debuted as a curator with the exhibition Can‚Äôt Take It Anymore, also at the VCCA, dedicated to the semantic and visual strategies of contemporary artists working with painting and graphic mediums. In 2010‚Äì2011, together with Nikolay Alekseev, Ilya Dolgov was nominated for the Innovation Prize, the all-Russian competition in the field of contemporary arts in the Regional Project of the Year category (Innovation VI: exhibition Live Museum of Performance, VCCA, 2010; Innovation VII: exhibition Utopia Ruins, H.L.A.M. Gallery, 2011). In 2012, Dolgov presented his project Herbarium for the first time at the H.L.A.M. Gallery, Voronezh, which included graphic work, installations made of reed, cane and moss, as well as video documentation of nature in its stereotypical vision. The graphic series depicted a re-drawn herbarium, collected at the Grafsky reserve under Voronezh in 1998 with the index of the class and order categories attached. In this project, the artist investigated the human perception of nature, the relations between an individual and nature, observes the expansion of the plant world and, in the installation of cane cubes, designs the invasion of the space by the plants. That same year, the project won the 2012 Innovation Prize in the Regional Contemporary Art Project nomination. Dolgov continued to collect and draw plants afterwards, so that the later versions of the Herbarium exhibition feature works executed in 2012 and later, as well as more recent installation pieces. In 2013, at the Moscow State University‚Äôs Zoological Museum in collaboration with Gallery 21 Ilya Dolgov presented his first personal exhibition in Moscow. In the Azoic project, the artist continued his investigation of the limits of relations between man, nature and machines. Here, Dolgov models a system of interconnections between imaginary creatures‚Äîchimeras‚Äîunveiling the ties inherent in the modern world, basing on the concept of Azoy as ‚Äúan ancient period in the history of the Earth, where there were no organisms, machines and humans, while the planet was inhabited by the Azoyids. In those creatures, the biological, the technological and the cultural had not yet divided into separate ways of being‚Äù. Using video, graphic works, scientific atlases and various other objects as his materials, Dolgov invents some of the chimeric Azoyids, but also discovers them in the everydayness (e.g. a water cart, a flowerbed, a carrier, a group of teenage traceurs in a concrete box, or a technology that takes care of the animals on a farm). In 2013 the project was nominated for the Kandinsky Prize‚Äîa national award in the field of contemporary art in the ‚ÄúYoung Artist. Project of the Year‚Äù category. His next nomination for the Kandinsky Prize came in 2015 in the same category, for the installation Model of Nature, Goethe‚Äôs Model exhibited at the XL Gallery in Moscow. In this piece, the artist concentrated on the interrelations between man and nature through the works of Goethe. The narrative was taken from Dolgov long-time ongoing online project ‚ÄúForest Journal‚Äù, meanwhile hexagons as a form of ‚Äúovergrowing‚Äù derived from D‚ÄôArcy Thompson‚Äôs theory of mathematical biology. Since 2013, Ilya Dolgov has been working on his creative research Internet project ‚ÄúForest Journal‚Äù focusing on nature and the attempts to understand, observe and describe it on a new level. Making a forest, wasteland, a meadow, a field, a coomb and a fowl-farm his subject matter, the author of the idea, Dolgov, in cooperation with Alex Buldakov, Ilya Romanov, Ivan Gorshkov, Zhanna Dolgova, Anastasiya Taylakova, Elizaveta Konovalova and Lukas Corte, through observation and sensual perception is aiming to answer the key question in each of the bimonthly issues: ‚ÄúWhat is nature?‚Äù In the artist‚Äôs own words, ‚ÄúForest Journal‚Äù is an attempt to make two steps back in the exploration of the world, in order to re-define it in a novel way. I‚Äôm employing the old-fashioned approach of a natural philosopher, an enthusiastic amateur natural scientist. Each of the issues is dedicated to one theme and includes texts, photographs, video, documentation of natural processes, and other materials. Ilya Dolgov currently lives and works in Kronstadt, under St Petersburg. His is married to Zhanna Dolgova, also an artist, member of the Lisichki Collective artistic group.

It ranges across the northern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, being present from the lower shore down to about , on sand, gravel and other habitats. Taxonomy This species was first described in 1804 by the zoologist and ornithologist George Montagu as Gordius annulatus but was later transferred to the newly created genus Tubulanus. Description T. annulatus is an elongated, slender worm that can reach in length but does not usually exceed in width except when fully contracted. The dorsal surface is a bright red, orange-red or brownish- red in colour, with three longitudinal white lines and up to fifty white transverse rings, while the underside is paler. The dorsal white line runs from the white snout region while the two lateral white lines start at the first transverse ring. There is no ventral white line as is the case in the otherwise similar Tubulanus superbus. The first transverse rings are far apart from each other while the remaining rings are closer together and approximately equidistant. This species does not have lateral sensory glands on its flanks, but there are cephalic glands (mucus-producing glands) on the head. It often secretes a silken mucous tube to which sand grains and other particles stick. It is possible that the distinctive colouring of this species is aposometic, warning fish or other predators that the worm is unpalatable. Distribution and habitat The range includes the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea as well as both Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America. Although sometimes found on the lower shore, it is more common in the subtidal zone to depths of about or more. It is found in a range of habitats including sand, gravel, silt and mud, as well as among shellfish. Ecology As an omnivore, T. annulatus functions as both a predator and scavenger. It glides over the seabed on a trail of slime produced by the cephalic glands. On encountering prey, the proboscis is everted (turned inside out) through a pore near the snout. The proboscis winds around the prey and mucus and toxic secretions immobilise it. It is then passed to the mouth and swallowed whole, or if too large, digestive juices are secreted onto it and the semi-digested tissues are sucked into the mouth.

Formed in 2013, the band currently consists of vocalist Eno Williams, guitarist Alfred Kari Bannerman, percussionist Anselmo Netto, drummer Jose Joyette, bassist John McKenzie, trombonist/keyboardist Tony Hayden, trumpeter/keyboardist Scott Baylis and saxophonist/keyboardist Max Grunhard. History The band was formed in London 2010 by producers Max Grunhard, Leon Brichard, and Benji Bouton. The trio were interested in producing music fusing elements from 1980s afrobeat and 90s drum-and-bass. They approached singer Eno Williams to create vocals for the project. After the first sessions had been successfully finished, live musicians were added to create a full band. These included the Ghanaian guitarist Alfred Bannerman from the band KonKoma and Afro-rock band Osibisa, Brazilian percussionist Anselmo Netto, and multi- instrumentalists Tony Hayden and Scott Baylis. The band released their first single in January 2014 on Soundway, entitled Lets Dance. Their self-titled debut album followed in March the same year. In 2016, the band signed to Merge Records to create their follow-up record. Their second album, Uyai, was released in 2017. Musical style Ibibio Sound Machine is a clash of African and electronic elements. The band claims their sound is inspired in equal measure by the golden era of West African funk and disco, modern post-punk, and electro. The name of the band itself finds influence from Eno Williams' mother, whose native tongue was Ibibio. While Williams was born in London, she spent most of her childhood in Nigeria with the rest of her family. Her mother often recounted numerous folk and children's stories from her own heritage and passed them on to her daughter. Williams took this inspiration and crafted lyrics from these sources and married them to modern themes.

She was very active in social service work and is considered the \\"founder of public nursing in Oregon\\". Early life Saidie Orr was born in Granger, Missouri, on June 23, 1880, the daughter of Robert Perry Orr and Catherine Lindsay. Career Saidie Orr Dunbar started her career with the Oregon Tuberculosis Association when she took over the position as executive secretary in 1913. She came back to this position later in her life and continued to tour Oregon regularly, promoted the setting up of county health departments, and setting up local groups to aid in the fight against tuberculosis before retiring in 1951. She was very actively involved in social service work; she served two terms as secretary of the National Conference of the Tuberculosis Secretaries; she was vice-president of the Portland Americanization Council; she was vice-president of the Council of Social Agencies. From 1923 to 1926 she was the head of the Federation of Women's Clubs in Oregon, and was a member of the national federation. She eventually became the president of the national federation in 1938 and maintained that position until 1941. She instituted a two-year course of study on Latin America that culminated with a Good Neighbor Tour to South America in 1940. With the support of the Oregon federation, the state legislature of Oregon passed a law in 1941 that provides measures such as blood testing to help to control or prevent syphilis from women expecting children. She was involved in the American way movements, which became popular during World War II. She believed that members of women's clubs \\"should make some contribution toward the safety, the permanence and the enrichment of our American way of life, which will carry us through the dark days ahead and add to the solidarity of our national life\\".

The second conviction has been named as the first murder conviction in Spain without a confession, murder weapon, body, or any organic remains of the victims. Laso disputes the validity of other forensic evidence and continues to claim his innocence. Early life Laso was born in Ja√©n, Spain in 1955, although he lived most of his life in Tarragona province. In the 1980s he lived with his wife Dolores \\"Lolita\\" Camacho (b. 1963) and their two children in Amposta, Tarragona. Laso and his brother-in-law Miguel Camacho ran a brothel in a four-room farmyard, with Laso acting as the pimp and recruiter of prostitutes. The partnership ended after Laso and Camacho had an argument during which Laso destroyed several mirrors, lights and other items in the place. In addition to his relationship with prostitutes, Laso was also unfaithful to his wife with other women. First murders Laso's wife was found decapitated by a train in Amposta Station shortly after midnight on June 9, 1988. The death was considered a suicide in spite of the Camachos' suspicions about Laso. Nine months later, Laso's car fell off a 20-metre cliff while transporting Laso and his six-year-old son. Laso was unharmed, despite claiming to have fallen off the cliff and been left unconscious for 15 minutes as a result of the incident, while his son was killed and incinerated. The car insurance provided Laso with 3.5 million pesetas that he used to establish a video rental store. Miguel Camacho feared that Laso intended to kill the whole family one by one, and hired a private investigator to find evidence that Laso had actually killed his wife and child. The PI proved that Laso had actually strangled his wife and that she was already dead when the train hit her. An indicator of this was that Camacho had not instinctively lifted her head as the train approached, unlike all deceased in known instances of suicide on train tracks. He also set his car on fire himself. Laso offered multiple versions of the events to law enforcement, and while he ultimately admitted to staging both \\"accidents\\", he never confessed to a murder. He was found guilty on trial and sentenced to 56 years in prison for both murders in 1993. Nonetheless, he was paroled already in 1999, citing good behaviour during his incarceration. Later murders After his release, Laso worked as an undertaker, ambulance driver and barman. He married Julia Lamas, a Tarragona building caretaker who didn't know about his criminal past. Nonetheless, Laso also had affairs with other women including Lamas's sister Mercedes, who was herself married to Maurici Font. Laso proposed Mercedes several times to divorce their respective spouses and move in together, but she refused. On 29 March 2009 Laso met Font in an orchard property of the former that both men tended to as a hobby; afterward, Laso picked his wife up at her workplace. Neither Font nor Lamas were ever seen again. Font, a retired hospital watchman, would often pick his wife up at the hospital where she worked at as a nurse, but he didn't show up that day. Instead, it was Laso who went to the place at 15.30 and told her that Font had an affair with his sister-in-law and that the two had run away together to never come back. At the time, Laso was sweaty, looked tired, was missing his glasses and had a scratch on the bridge of his nose, which fueled Mercedes's suspicions. They went to the residences of both people missing, where she noticed that most of their items were still in their place, including Julia's car. Mercedes said that they should report the disappearances to the Mossos d'Esquadra, but Laso talked her out of it, insisting that it was a voluntary disappearance. Nevertheless, Mercedes denounced the disappearances the next day after talking to a female friend and shared her suspicions about Laso. The Mossos interrogated Laso several times. He was always collaborative and accused Mercedes of lying. In one of the interrogations, Laso revealed that Font had called his mother from Morella, Castell√≥n, where Julia's adult son from a previous marriage lived, and told her to not worry about them, that they were starting a new life together and that Julia had a new job in a local retirement home. Julia's son later testified that Laso had travelled to Morella and attempted to talk to him, but that he had ignored him. Sometime later, \\"Font\\" called the offices of the Diari de Tarragona from Morella, stating the same plus the fact that he had left in disgust after discovering that his wife was unfaithful, and requested that the investigation on their disappearance be closed. He also sent a fax to the Social Security office to request that his monthly pension be deposited in a new bank account. The fax included a copy of Font's National Identity Document (DNI), but the accompanying signature was not his own. Laso also tried to usurp the job of Julia Lamas as the building caretaker. When GPS and mobile phone tracking showed that Laso had been at the time and place where all the communications had been sent from, the missing persons investigation was reworked as a murder investigation and Laso was arrested as the suspect. The Mossos searched Laso's orchard extensively, along with his bar (where he dug a hole in the basement after the disappearances) and the Amposta cemetery where he had worked in as an undertaker and his first family was buried. GPS showed that he had driven to the cemetery once at 01.30, after being in his orchard, but the bodies were never found. At Laso's home, the Mossos found Julia's glasses, a colour copy of her DNI, the prepaid mobile phone used to call the Diari, and a crowbar and hoe that tested positive for haemoglobin. However, no undegraded DNA could be retrieved from the tools for comparison. In 2010, after the disappearances but prior to his arrest, Laso had a relationship with another woman and attempted to start yet another simultaneously with a recently divorced neighbour. When the neighbour refused, Laso sneaked into her basement and left a rose taped to a dead bird. The next day, the woman had a car accident and was informed that someone had manipulated the brakes. Trial and sentence Laso manifested several times that he looked forward to the trial, believing that no jury could condemn him of murder without a body. However, he was pronounced guilty of both counts and subsequently sentenced to 30 years in prison, in 2014. The Supreme Court of Spain upheld the sentence in 2016. Laso's orchard was expropriated after the investigation and a road built over it.

Two OGPU officers search the room of Father Anton Kirillitch, who has been banned from his church and ordered to stop preaching. He shares the room with Grigori Orlov, ejected from his Chair at the University for a \\"reactionary\\" refusal to give a Marxist slant to his literature lectures. Both live in poverty, in half a room of Grigori's former house, now seized by the State. To visit Grigori come his son, Andrey, and his son's wife, Elizaveta, both 35, who eloped to England in 1914 and are now naturalised British. Andrey, a left-wing writer in London, is horrified by his father's treatment and by the workings of the Soviet r√©gime. Elizaveta, a doctor in London, has tried the West and found it wanting. She is more open-minded about the USSR, and finds a non-sentimental attraction in the work to be done. Their marriage is in trouble: she no longer loves Andrey. Vera Levine, 19, Elizaveta's sister whom she last saw before the War, arrives, an \\"agricultural expert\\" full of youthful enthusiasm for the New Russia, along with Leonti Levine, their father, a former antiques-dealer now Inspector of Collective Farms in the northern Ukraine. With the Levines is Vladimir Blok, 30, an OGPU official and Revolutionary Judge. Vera suggests that the returned √©migr√©s visit \\"her\\" collective farm in the Ukraine. Vladimir gives permission (Orlov son might perhaps be pressured to write positively about the USSR when he returns to London) and allows Grigori to accompany them. Act One closes with the arrest by the OGPU of Father Anton, who knows this means the Lubyanka and liquidation. Act Two takes places three days later at a railway station in western Russia, where the travelling party are waiting for a connection. Behind the political arguments, Elizaveta and Vladimir are sexually attracted; Andrey and Vera are falling in love. Leonti loathes Grigori from pre-Revolution days (they quarrelled over their children's elopement). When Leonti briefly leaves his luggage unattended, Grigori glances at Levine's pocket-book, finds something compromising inside, darts to the cloakroom to make a copy, then returns the book to the frantic Leonti, who thought it had been stolen. On the collective farm in Act Three, in the Soviet House, Vera is in her element and full of pride. We witness a workers' wedding where the Soviet girls dance with spirit. Elizaveta tells Andrey their marriage is over: she has chosen Vladimir and will stay on in the USSR. The atmosphere darkens with a series of peremptory trials presided over by Vladimir: crimes against the individual are punished leniently, crimes against property (and therefore the State) with terrible vengeance. When some peasants are accused of being kulaks and sentenced to the Gulag for \\"hoarding\\" small quantities of grain, Andrey, watching, can take no more. He snatches Blok's pistol and shoots him dead. He is seized and knows he will be executed. Grigori, to save his son, tells Elizaveta what he found in her father's pocket-book: Leonti has been smuggling goods across the nearby Polish frontier (an \\"anti-Soviet\\" activity). Elizaveta, he insists, must blackmail her father with the threat of telling the fanatical Vera, to smuggle Andrey across the frontier. Andrey, however, will only attempt the escape if his father comes too. Elizaveta confronts Levine, who, terrified of Vera, caves in. The telephone line is cut. After delivering Vladimir's funeral oration offstage (which we hear), a tearful Vera enters to say goodbye to Andrey before he is carried off to Kiev. After a minute or two, she realises that the muffled figure in the dark room she has been addressing is not Andrey, but Elizaveta. The Orlovs have escaped. Elizaveta hints at what has happened; we guess Levine will not return. Vera raises the alarm ‚Äì in vain. The play ends with Elizaveta attempting to console her weeping sister. Productions and publication The first dramatisation of the Soviets on London's West-end stage, The Bear Dances was directed at the Garrick by Leon M. Lion, with designs and d√©cor by Robert Lutyens. The first night was attended by some serving members of the British Cabinet and by various ambassadors to London. The play ran from 31 October to 5 November 1932 (only eight performances), closing early. It was, however, with cuts,Lucas, letter to Rogers of the People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne, 21 November 1932 revived with more success by various repertory theatres in the North of England in the later 1930s, including the People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne.Lucas, F. L., Four Plays (Cambridge, 1935), Preface The text was published in May 1933 by Cassell and Company of London. To it was added a long Introduction, 'The Gospel According to St Marx', in which Lucas discussed the shortcomings of Soviet Communism and defended his play against the reviewers' criticism.

E.

L., autobiographical essay in World Authors, 1950‚Äì1970: A Companion Volume to Twentieth-Century Authors, ed.

L., The Bear Dances: A Play in Three Acts (London, 1933), Introduction), with Vera and Vladimir acting as spokesmen for the new order, Lucas's verdict on the Soviet system is damning. Fear, inhumanity, injustice abound. The play's title suggests captivity, pain and submission.Edith Shackleton in Time and Tide, 5 November 1932, p.1222 \\"The intolerable thing about Moscow,\\" wrote Lucas, \\"is not that it is Communist; it is that it is not Communist. Genuine Communism, while one might disagree with it, one could respect. But this pseudo-Communism of the Kremlin is perhaps the most gigantic sham in history. It has waded through seas of blood ‚Äì for what? That a r√©gime where the rich were powerful might be replaced by a r√©gime where the powerful are rich.\\" Lucas, F. L., 'A Week of Berlin', Manchester Guardian, 19 and 20 October, 1948 Reception Despite approval of its subject-matter (\\"Any study of conditions in Soviet Russia is certain at the moment to command attention,\\" noted The SpectatorThe Spectator, 4 November 1932) and praise for the directing, acting, and designs, the reviewers found The Bear Dances \\"overladen with pamphleteering argument, on both sides\\". \\"The play's weakness lies in its tendency to repeated pleading,\\" observed Ivor Brown in The Week-end Review.The Week-end Review, 5 November 1932, p.541 \\"Heavy blue pencilling would have given this play a chance of life,\\" agreed John Pollock in The Saturday Review.The Saturday Review, 5 November 1932, p.474 The Stage conceded that the trial scene, the fatal firing, the bargaining with Levine, and the escape \\"were all more or less interesting and effective\\".The Stage, 3 November 1932; p.14 Henri Barbusse in The Daily Worker, however, condemned the playwright for peddling \\"slanderous caricatures\\" of the Soviet Union. (\\"Too unnerving,\\" was Lucas‚Äôs comment on this.) Komisarjevsky, calling it the only authentic play on the USSR by an Englishman that he had seen, told Lucas that he would have liked to have produced it himself.

Preparation  The cakes are made from a dough of semolina, butter, and milk or water, and leavened with baking powder. The dough may also contain some sugar. The dough is formed into rounds and then cooked on a hot griddle or flat pan. The use of semolina gives harcha a crumbly texture comparable to cornbread. In Rif, Morocco, buttermilk or yogurt, thinned with water, can be used instead of milk. Harcha can be made into small pancakes, or large ones the size of a truck tire.  Serving culture  Moroccan Harcha with Moroccan mint tea Harcha is commonly smeared with honey and butter, and served with mint tea during breakfast or as a snack. It is also one of the breads consumed during Ramadan. It can also be served like a sandwich, stuffed with cheese or with meat confit. Finally, it can be crumbled and used as a tender bed for stew.  Variants  Terminology for the bread may vary across Morocco and Algeria. Agronomy specialist Mike Sissons for example mentions the term \\"mbesses\\" as a variant of harcha. Mbesses however may instead refer to a sweet cake found in Algeria, also called Khobz Mbesses which has similar but not identical ingredients. In the late 19th century, Algerian bakers who migrated to Fes, Morocco, introduced a type of bread called El Khobz El Harcha, which was made by sprinkling semolina on the bread before putting it in the oven. This is clearly different from and should not be confused with Harcha, which is entirely made from semolina flour and other ingredients such as milk. In the rural hinterland of Algiers, it is commonly called harch√¢ya, while timharchat prevails in Kabylia, and the term ragda is used elsewhere in Algeria.

The second whorl shows three strong spiral threads. The following three whorls contain 11 or 12 axial ribs with subequal interspaces and no pronounced shoulder. The spiral sculpture between the sutures of three consists of strong subequal flattish threads somewhat swollen when they override the ribs, and with a few much finer threads in the interspaces between the major threads. The spaces between the reticulation on the earlier whorls are deep and have a pitlike aspect. Near the suture in fresh specimens is a dark spiral band extending to the rounded shoulder, in front of which the shell is yellowish white with (on the body whorl) four or five narrow brown spiral lines with much wider interspaces.

The novel addresses serious themes including sexual exploitation, corruption, and drug use. As a social-political novel, it critiques the ongoing social injustice in post-apartheid South Africa.  Plot summary  Azure is a twelve-year-old orphan with astonishing blue eyes and dark skin. At the opening of the novel, it is revealed that he left home three years ago after the murder of his parents. Azure roams the streets of Sea Point in Cape Town. His typical day consists of a lot of walking, a bath at the beach in the morning, parking cars in the city during the day, and sleeping near a swimming pool at night. He is well aware of other street kids whom he claims are deep into evil. Azure introduces his nine-year-old friend Bafana in chapter one who, unlike Azure, is into drugs and chooses to roam the streets even though he is not homeless. Liesel is also introduced in chapter one. She is a prostitute who sells joints to Azure and lives under the bridge along with ‚Äúskollies,‚Äù gangsters, and drunks. Azure earns most of his money by prostituting himself to ‚Äúmoffies,‚Äù which is the term used to refer to gay men. Azure gives his money to his older friend Joyce to put into a bank account for him. She insists on it as she tells him she knows how banks work. Azure calls Joyce ‚ÄúAuntie‚Äù out of respect and promises her he will never become part of a gang. He stays safe on the streets with the protection of Allen, a gangster pimp who works at Green Point. Allen is depicted as controlling and excessively violent. Azure cannot do anything with his own money unless he discusses it with Allen. It is through Allen that Azure realizes the power in money. One day, Azure goes under the bridge to visit Liesel but finds that she is not there. He instead spends time with Sealy, a gangster who also lives under the bridge. Soon, the gang leader Gerald pulls up in a car and calls Sealy away. When Gerald returns, Azure accidentally calls him Sealy. Gerald is immediately infuriated that Azure has compared him to a \\"kaffir\\" (a native black man) when he prides himself on his light skin. In his fury, Gerald assaults Azure and Azure runs away. Azure finds it difficult making money through prostitution. He keeps his distance from the bridge and remains constantly on guard for the sight of Gerald's car. Azure is too afraid to venture into town as he might face Gerald. He is also avoiding Allen because he hasn‚Äôt earned any money to give him, as well as Joyce because he is too embarrassed to show himself dirty and without shoes. Still looking to make money, Azure stays around the park in hopes that he will be picked up by a \\"moffie\\". Eventually one arrives and rewards Azure with fifty dollars for his services. Azure heads over to Bree Street to meet up with his friend Vincent. Vincent informs him that Gerald has been looking for Azure. He advises Azure to stop hiding and go directly to Gerald. Vincent states that Gerald believes himself to be white only because he has straight hair and light skin. It is from this that he derives his power and is therefore envious of Azure's blue eyes. Azure decides to take Vincent's advice and confront Gerald. He goes to his shack and finds Sealy sitting outside. He asks Sealy where Gerald is before Sealy suddenly begins to brutally assault Azure, telling him that he must do this because Gerald is watching. Azure is severely injured. After Gerald forces Azure to wash his car, he calls on his other followers to take Azure to the hospital. At the hospital, they lie to the doctors and say that Azure was beat up by a store owner for stealing. After his hospital visit, Azure is taken to a brothel in Salt River where he is locked inside a small room for three days. He tells himself that the adults around him only abuse him to make him stronger. Azure becomes weak from hunger and abuse. However, he believes he is becoming stronger as a result of the mistreatment he faces from adults. During Azure's stay in the brothel, he is forced to perform sexual acts with other men. Richard, his host, changes Azure's name to ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù because of his eyes. Vincent explains to Azure, after his release from the brothel, that Gerald is extremely dangerous. He portrays Gerald as a big T-Rex. Later, Gerald confronts Azure under the bridge. Gerald explains that he killed Azure's parents in order to make him stronger. He also explains that Richard and his friends forced themselves on Azure only to make him feel what it's like to be a woman. Gerald tells Azure to never go back to Sea Point. Azure soon discovers that Joyce has stolen his money. He decides he cannot trust anyone, especially with his money. In the moment, Azure uses the remainder of his money to purchase a bomber jacket with an orange lining despite Gerald's warning that only he is allowed to wear this colour. In response, Gerald threatens him and saws off the cast on his leg. Azure manages to escape and runs down the main road. Driven by madness, Azure climbs Table Mountain where he settles himself inside a cave. During his stay in the cave, Azure's desire to swim becomes stronger. He begins to have intense and imaginative dreams. In his dreams there is a T-Rex that destroys the town below the mountain and even eats Gerald. Azure wakes up from this dream with a determination to go swimming. For four days and nights, Azure continues to have obscure dreams. The dreams have one significant character, a beautiful woman named Saartjie who claims she is married to the T-Rex. After four days, Azure leaves the mountain with only thirteen cents in his pocket. He returns to town and finds Liesel's shack, along with the others under the bridge, completely destroyed. While looking for Gerald, Azure meets Sealy who informs him that Gerald committed suicide. Gerald was planning on killing Azure and went mad searching for him. Sealy reveals he only made it look like Azure's ankle was broken to fool Gerald and save Azure. Furthermore, he says he knows Azure killed Gerald and that's why he ascended the mountain. Azure concludes that Sealy is mad. Azure begins to no longer view himself as a ‚Äúboy‚Äù because he has seen things that have made him grow up. Azure believes grown-ups are evil, but still accompanies Sealy with his daily tasks. Sealy, the new leader of the gang, gets into hard drugs and is eventually arrested by the police. In the chaos, Azure leaves for the mountain again. On his journey he repeats to himself that his mother and father are dead. He finds another cave and dances madly around the fire he makes. The novel concludes with Azure describing a powerful storm that destroys the town and beach below. Azure watches the storm from the safety of the highest point of the mountain. He sees fire falling from the sky and engulfing the town and declares that the sun rules over everything. He repeats to himself that his mother and father are dead. He states that he knows what fear is because he has seen the center of darkness.  Characters  Azure - The protagonist of the novel, Azure is a twelve-year- old orphan boy living on the streets of Cape Town, South Africa. After the assassination of his parents in Johannesburg, he leaves his home feeling lost. Azure's physical appearance is unique due to his blue eyes and dark skin, making it difficult to racially categorize him. He shows a fascination with water and swimming throughout the novel. As a street child, Azure is exposed and subjected to drug use, gang activity, and abuse. He survives through prostitution by selling sex to older men. Later in the novel, he turns thirteen which he views as his entrance into manhood. He consistently tells himself that his struggles are making him stronger as a man. Bafana - Azure's friend, who lives on the streets. He is a nine-year-old boy whom Azure thinks is naughty because Bafana has a home to go back to but chooses to roam the streets and do drugs including sniffing glue and smoking buttons. Azure beats him whenever he sees him doing drugs. Liesel - Azure's older friend, Liesel is a woman who lives under the bridge and makes her money through prostitution. She is the one who sells Azure his joints during the beginning of the novel. She is deemed untrustworthy later in the novel after Sealy tells Azure that she was putting other substances in her joints. \\"Auntie\\" Joyce - Azure's older friend, whom he calls auntie out of respect. She works at the restaurant La Perla and often leaves leftovers near a bush for Azure and Bafana in the morning. In exchange, Azure runs errands for her. Azure trusts Joyce with his money. When he goes to retrieve his money later in the novel, Azure discovers that Joyce has been cheating him, which ends their relationship. Allen - A gangster pimp who works at Green Point. He is known for his bad temper and Azure claims he has witnessed him kill someone. If Azure wishes to buy anything he must first talk to Allen. When Allen is first introduced in the novel he severely beats one of the white women who works for him. Azure learns the value of power associated with money from Allen, who wears designer clothes and always has to be the best dressed. Vincent attributes Allen's temper and obsession with designer clothes to his anger over the fact that he is not full white but, in fact, mixed race. Sealy - One of Gerald's \\"minions\\". He lives under the bridge but is friendly with Azure. He is very stylish and can out dance anyone in town. According to Azure, this is the reason why Gerald is fond of him. After Gerald's death, Sealy becomes the new leader of the gang with Azure as his right-hand man. He beats up Azure when he comes to confront Gerald but later tells him he did him a favour by not injuring him more severely. Gerald - Gerald lives under the bridge and is the ringleader of the gang the Twenty-Eights. He prides himself on his light skin and straight hair. Vincent - Azure's special friend, whom he has known from his school days in Johannesburg. He is very in tune with the goings on in Cape Town and helps Azure whenever he can. He hangs out around Bree Street in town. Later on in the novel, Vincent leaves town, leaving Azure to face life by himself. Richard - Another of Gerald's minions, takes Azure to the hospital after being beat up by Sealy and then locks him in a room inside a brothel for three days. He is a pedophile who forces Azure to engage in sexual acts with him and his friends.  Themes   Sexuality  Sexuality is a prominent theme in the novel through its numerous scenes of graphically depicted homosexual acts. Azure survives by selling sex to older men he terms ‚Äòmoffies.‚Äô Literary scholars have suggested differing interpretations of Azure's sexualization. Some characterize Azure's homosexual acts as nothing more than a survival tactic and means of making money while others consider them as a part of his sexual growth and exploration. In his introduction, Shaun Viljoen presents his reading of the narrative as ‚Äúa bildungsroman of the boy‚Äôs sexuality in formation‚Äù with the exploration of homosexuality as a possible subtext. Other scholars go further in describing it as a ‚Äúcoming-out narrative of young South African gays battling with non-acceptance.\\" In an interview, Duiker denied the novel is about gay identity and said, ‚Äú'I‚Äôm a writer and interested in every aspect of human relations and identity. The whole thing is not an issue for me. My first novel, Thirteen Cents, did not have a gay character and neither will the third. I really don‚Äôt want to be pigeon-holed.'‚Äù  Coming of Age  The novel has been interpreted as a coming-of-age narrative which follows Azure's growth into manhood and confrontation with very adult circumstances. He must learn how to survive within an adult world of crime and corruption. He comes to believe that these things make him stronger in order to become a man.  Drugs  Throughout the novel, both main and secondary characters are frequently portrayed as being deeply involved in the use and sale of drugs such as marijuana. Although Azure condemns Bafana for doing hard drugs, he himself smokes marijuana several times throughout the novel in order to cope with his circumstances.  Pedophilia  Azure makes his money through prostituting himself to gay men. Although he consents to engaging in such sexual acts, the novel can be seen as broaching the subject of pedophilia and child molestation because Azure is underage. Most of Azure's clients are married white men who are in the closet about their sexuality; however, during his stay in the brothel, he is forced into performing sexual acts for Richard and his friends.  Survival  Azure lost both his parents at a young age because they were murdered. At the beginning of the narrative, he has lived on the streets for three years. The skills and techniques he uses to feed, clothe, and bathe himself indicate his ability to adapt and conform to life on the streets in order to survive. Much of the novel centers around his ability to survive in Cape Town's underworld without sacrificing his personal set of morals and values. He is often alone and must fend for himself.  Strength  Azure believes that everything he is going through is only happening to make him stronger.  Literary elements   Narration  The novel is narrated in the first person by its protagonist, Azure. Azure's immaturity is evident in his use of childlike vocabulary and syntax including ‚Äúthe frequency of the narrating pronoun 'I,' probably the most frequent word in the text; the short emotive sentences; and the clipped and sparse dialogue.\\" Such elements create a stark contrast with Azure's ‚Äúharsh and very adult circumstances‚Äù which are far from childlike and innocent. Duiker continuously alternates between realist, hyperrealist, and surrealist narration as his protagonist experiences different realms of consciousness. His sober depiction of Azure's lived reality as a street kid in Cape Town is interwoven with the character's hyperrrealist dream sequences. The supernatural is also present through the supposed ability of other street kids to take the shape of rats or pigeons and of Gerald to transform into the T-rex. Duiker's other novels feature similar supernatural and mythical elements which contribute to the author's critique of South African society. Under apartheid, much of the literature written by black authors featured a protagonist who is metonymic of the greater black community, meaning that the experiences of the individual also stand for the condition and experiences of the racial community as a whole. However, Thirteen Cents reflects the deviation of post-apartheid literature from this form of allegory. Azure's voice and perspective is not metonymic of the black South African racial community but exists as an exceptional individual who is not easily categorized.  Setting  Thirteen Cents is set in Cape Town, South Africa following the 1994 democratic election of Nelson Mandela which formally marked the end of apartheid. While Duiker does not comment on government affairs directly, the social and political context of post- apartheid South Africa as it applies to the individual constitutes a major part of the novel. Shaun Viljoen contests that much of the book deals with Azure's ‚Äúinterrogation and exploration of the temporal and spatial dimensions of his urban world.\\" Azure must navigate the dangers presented by Cape Town's underworld of drugs and gangs and overcome the dehumanizing forces that ‚Äúengulf and consume him on the streets\\" His desperate attempt to escape these violent conditions requires him to physically remove himself from the city by climbing Table Mountain.  Language  Several of the linguistic strategies used by Duiker in Thirteen Cents are characteristic of post-apartheid fiction, which challenges the previous linguistic separation of South African literature under apartheid. The use of untranslated words and code-switching by alternating between English and Afrikaans in the novel has become a common method of representing the coexistence of multiple languages in South African culture. Duiker combines English with regional dialect that mixes standard South African English and Afrikaans with Sotho and Xhosa words throughout the narrative. The purpose and implications of Duiker's frequent code-switching have been interpreted differently by various scholars in the field. Shaun Viljoen views the ‚Äúabsence of authorial mediation between the language of the story and readers‚Äù as suggesting Duiker's ‚Äúdesire to construct an uncompromising, true to life account of a harsh reality.\\" Contrarily, Kazeem Adebiyi asserts that these linguistic strategies celebrate the ‚Äúhybridity which has come to be associated with postcolonial culture‚Äù and that they point to the ‚Äúincipient rapprochement between hitherto adversarial codes in the country.\\" Duiker's use of code-switching follows in the tradition of other South African novelists including Peter Abrahams, Nadine Gordimer, and Richard Rive. However, unlike these writers, Duiker broaches taboo issues not addressed in other novels. Viljoen identifies three conventional boundaries of fictional representation which Duiker crosses in Thirteen Cents - ‚Äúhe graphically depicts sex between child and adult, he does so specifically in relation to homosexual acts, and he uses expletives and the language of insult in a sustained manner that goes beyond inflecting the prose with local color.\\" Duiker himself said ‚Äú\\"I don‚Äôt go out intentionally to shock. A lot of what I said could have been toned down. But violence is so much a part of our culture that if I had toned it down it wouldn‚Äôt have been authentic.\\"‚Äù  Genre  Thirteen Cents has been classified as a modern South African crime novel within the post-apartheid literary world. Duiker provides an excruciatingly realistic description of the dislocation and breakdown of communities and families in post-liberation South Africa. He also explores themes of corruption through police involvement in illegal drug use and gang activities. However, the apocalyptic ending as perceived through Azure‚Äôs eyes indicates the possibility for the growth of a more hopeful future. Duiker‚Äôs portrayal of a protagonist venturing into a life of crime creates an entry point into Cape Town‚Äôs marginalized underworld community and aligns with many other crime novels by black writers. Through Azure‚Äôs narration, Duiker illustrates the ‚Äúcomplex social realities that propel young black men toward crime.\\" In comparison, primarily white authors write detective novels from a perspective of law and order.  Influence for novel  In 1998, K. Sello Duiker spent three and a half weeks living with street children in Cape Town after being asked to help find a boy who had gone missing. Studying copywriting at the time, his absence resulted in his expulsion from college and his institutionalization in a psychiatric facility for two months. The experience of living on the streets was inspirational for him and upon his release he completed the first draft of Thirteen Cents in a few weeks. In interviews, Duiker has identified Bessie Head, Ben Okri, Ayi Kwei Armah, and Dambudzo Marechera as his literary influences. Scholars have also suggested that the character Azure alludes to Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye.  As post- apartheid literature  Thirteen Cents, along with Duiker's other works, is an example of post-apartheid literature. The genre moves away from a strict focus on racial binaries and political themes to more contemporary and intimate issues including violence, crime, poverty, and homosexuality. In Thirteen Cents, Duiker transgresses the binary categories of black and white to explore broader themes of crime and corruption and homosexuality as experienced by Azure. Yet, due consideration is still given to race and how it affects the lives of the characters in the novel. Racial identity and hierarchy comes to the forefront of the novel when Gerald believes that Azure likened him to a kaffir and when Vincent attributes Allen's unhinged violence to his inability to conceal his coloured blood.  Social commentary  Scholars have interpreted Thirteen Cents as a critique of South African society and, more specifically, of the issue of street children in post-apartheid South Africa. Mamadou Abdou Balou Ngom identifies the novel as ‚Äúan indictment of South African society.\\" The world depicted by Duiker through the detailed descriptions of Azure's struggle to survive on the streets is one of rampant violence and sexual exploitation. According to Ngom, by helping to expose the ‚Äúmultifaceted hardships facing street youths,‚Äù the novel significantly contributes to the literature on street children. Duiker also confronts the treatment of street children as criminals and a public nuisance by the authorities. This is evident through the doctor's hostility towards Azure in the hospital. On a broader scale, the novel portrays South Africa's acute poverty and socio-economic inequalities.

Life Maximilien Sorre, who signed his works \\"Max Sorre\\", was born in Rennes, Brittany, on 16 July 1880. He studied at the √âcole Normale de Rennes. From 1899 to 1901 he studied at the √âcole normale de Saint Cloud, which trained teachers for the departmental √©coles normales. On 6 August 1901 he was awarded a certificate to teach as a professor at the √âcoles Normales and the √âcoles primaires sup√©rieures. In 1902 he was appointed professor at the √âcole Normale de La Roche-sur-Yon. Sorre was appointed to Perpignan and then to Montpellier in 1903. He had already accepted the geographic views of Paul Vidal de La Blache and Emmanuel de Martonne. At the University of Montpellier he was taught by Charles Flahault, professor of botany. This course let him enroll in a doctorate under the direction of Paul Vidal de La Blache on a theme of biological geography in the eastern Pyrenees, a pioneering work he presented in 1913. His complementary thesis was entitled: \\"A critical study of the sources of the history of viticulture and the trade of wines and spirits in Lower Languedoc in the eighteenth century\\". During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Sorre was mobilized as an officer in 1914, and was seriously wounded in Artois in the autumn of 1915. While convalescing he established a closer relationship with Vidal, whose son had been lost in the war. After the war he was accepted in turn by the universities of Bordeaux, Strasbourg and then Lille in 1922. After the death of Antoine Vacher in 1920 the teaching of geography at the University of Lille had been disorganized for two years. Sorre stayed at Lille for a long period, and in 1925 accepted the chair of Regional Geography there. In 1929 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Letters of Lille, holding that position for eleven years. He also held the posts of Rector of the Acad√©mie de Clermont (1931‚Äì34) and Rector of the Academy of Aix-Marseille (1934‚Äì37). Sorre had left-wing views, and under the Popular Front he was named director of primary education by Jean Zay. He was director of Primary and Post-school Education from 2 June 1937. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) The Vichy Regime dismissed him from this position due to his political views, and he was returned to the Lille Faculty of Letters by a decree of 29 July 1940. In October 1940 Sorre was given the chair of Human Geography at the Sorbonne, where he ended his teaching career. At the end of his life Maximilien Sorre was President of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in the rue d'Ulm, Paris. He died on 10 August 1962. The Lyc√©e Maximilien Sorre in Cachan, Val-de-Marne, is named after him. Views During the first half of the 20th century Maximilien Sorre developed the concepts that Paul Vidal de La Blache had laid out in his Principes de g√©ographie humaine, adding concepts from the biological sciences and exploring the relations of man with his environment. Albert Demangeon had paved the way for more systematic conceptualizations of Social geography with his posthumously published argument that social groups ought to be within the center of human geographical analysis. That task was carried out by Pierre George and Maximilien Sorre, among others. Sorre was interested in the biological conditions of habitability of regions of the world, and the process of transfer of populations and cultures by international migrations. He was interested in the effect of epidemics and of changing environmental conditions. With this orientation he disregarded the dominant trends of post- war French geography.

In 2005, Nathans completed a training as Jewish Spiritual director, with Lev Shomea, Institute for Jewish Spiritual Direction. In 2007 Nathans Consultancy became part of Rijnconsult, and Hannah started HaMakor, Centre for Jewish Spirituality.http://www.hamakor.nl Nathans got a master in Hebrew language and culture at the University of Amsterdam.

He was a founding member of the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) in New York. He introduced the lambda symbol for the gay movement. He meant the lambda to symbolize the liberation that was achievable through activism, the link due to the fact that in chemistry the lambda is a sign for a catalyst and in Doerr's concept it symbolized an \\"exchange of energy\\". Originally the sign was colored chrome yellow ‚Äì a reference to the Aldous Huxley novel Crome Yellow ‚Äì on a dark blue field. In 1970 ten GAA members occupied the Republican State Committee headquarters to demand Governor Nelson Rockefeller support gay rights.

I and many of your friends, Tom, will find > it much harder to stumble on without you. A somewhat reticent, gentle > prophet died this week... We are crushed at losing you... Fortified in > having known you. Doerr died on August 2, 1987, and is buried with his parents at Centre County Memorial Park, State College, Pennsylvania.

Jose was the tenth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. Jose developed into a tropical storm on September 5 from a tropical wave that left the west coast of Africa nearly a week prior. A period of rapid intensification ensued on September 6, when Jose reached hurricane intensity. On September 8, it reached its peak intensity as a high- end Category 4 hurricane. However, due to wind shear, Jose weakened over the next few days as it completed an anti-cyclonic loop north of Hispaniola. Despite weakening to a tropical storm on September 14, Jose managed to regain hurricane intensity the next day as it began to curve northwards. Never strengthening above Category 1 status for the remainder of its lifespan, Jose degraded to a tropical storm once again on September 20\\\\. Two days later, Jose transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone as it drifted northeastwards off the coast of New England. By September 26, Jose's remnants dissipated off the East Coast of the United States. Initially projected to impact the Antilles already affected by Hurricane Irma, Jose triggered evacuations in catastrophically damaged Barbuda, as well as in Saint Martin. Eventually, as Jose changed its path, its inner core and thus the strongest winds stayed offshore. Nonetheless, Jose still brought tropical storm-force winds to those islands. Later on, Jose brought heavy rain, swells, and rough surf to the East Coast of the United States, causing beach erosion and some flooding. A woman died after she was caught in a rip current in Asbury Park. Meteorological history A westward-moving tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August 31. The wave passed south of Cape Verde on September 2, with a large area of disorganized thunderstorms. However, environmental conditions favored gradual development, which prompted the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to start tracking the system. Early on September 4, a surface low formed within the wave while located around 615 mi (990 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Continued organization occurred, and it is estimated a tropical depression formed by 06:00 UTC on September 5, with intensification to tropical storm status occurring six hours later; as such, it was named Jose. Operationally, the NHC did not initiate advisories until 15:00 UTC that day as a tropical storm, nine hours after it had actually formed. Once Jose became a tropical storm, gradual intensification ensued within the favorable environment of warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and abundant moisture. The storm developed an eye-like feature and symmetric, radial convection as it tracked west-northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge. Early on September 6, a period of rapid intensification ensued, due to the favorable conditions, with Jose attaining hurricane intensity by 18:00 UTC that day. Meanwhile, Jose, along with hurricanes Irma and Katia, marked the first time that three hurricanes were simultaneously present in the Atlantic since 2010. Despite being close to the outflow from the much larger Hurricane Irma to its west, Jose continued to quickly intensify over the next two days, which eventually culminated with it attaining peak winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a minimum pressure of at 18:00 UTC on September 8, while located to the east of the Leeward Islands. Upon doing so, Jose, along with Irma nearing landfall in Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, marked the first time two Atlantic hurricanes had maximum sustained winds of at least 155 mph (250 km/h) occurring simultaneously. Tropical Storm Jose off the United States East Coast on September 19 Jose slowly weakened as the eye became cloud-filled and wind shear began affecting the storm, dropping below Category 4 intensity by 18:00 UTC on September 10. The storm weakened below major hurricane status 06:00 UTC the following day, and below Category 2 status by 18:00 UTC September 11 as higher wind shear began to erode the core. As the storm was entering an anti- cyclonic loop, Jose was downgraded to a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on September 15 based on Dvorak estimates which put its wind speed below hurricane strength. At this time the NHC noted that northerly wind shear had kept all significant banding to the southeastern quadrant and the center was to the northwest of most convection. However, as the storm was completing the anti-cyclonic loop later on that day, a reconnaissance plane recorded surface winds above hurricane threshold. Accordingly, the NHC re-upgraded Jose to a hurricane. Rounding the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, Jose moved northward, beginning on September 16. Despite an asymmetric appearance on satellite imagery, the hurricane intensified slightly, reaching a secondary peak intensity of 90 mph (150 km/h) at 12:00 UTC on September 17. The wind field expanded as Jose continued northward, and a large convective band developed along the northern periphery as the central area of thunderstorms diminished. An area of convection and an eye feature reformed on September 19 while the storm was east of North Carolina. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September 20 indicated that Jose weakened to tropical storm status, by which time the storm turned to the northeast. Thereafter, the central convection diminished as the storm passed north of the Gulf Stream over cooler water temperatures. Early on September 22, the NHC redesignated Jose as a post- tropical cyclone, after convection had diminished for over 12 hours, and since the storm had acquired a frontal system. The northern convective band moved over New England while the center drifted southeast of Cape Cod. The remnants of Jose meandered around for another three days, before dissipating on September 25. Preparations and impact Leeward Islands and Bahamas Jose (right) strengthening while threatening the Leeward Islands during the first occurrence of three active Atlantic hurricanes since 2010. Hurricanes Irma and Katia can be seen to the left of Jose. Hurricane Jose threatened the Lesser Antilles within days of catastrophic damage by Hurricane Irma, especially in Barbuda, which was 95% destroyed by Irma. The government of Antigua and Barbuda began efforts on September 8 to evacuate the entire island prior to Jose's anticipated arrival. Nine shelters housing 17,000 persons were opened on Barbuda. Women and children of Saint Martin attempted to flee the island, although men stayed. However, the inner core remained far offshore of the Lesser Antilles, sparing Antigua and Barbuda. Moist southerly flow across the United States Virgin Islands resulted in thunderstorm activity; some flooding occurred on Saint Croix, inflicting $500,000 in damage. The government of the Bahamas shut down the Nassau International Airport and ordered evacuation from vulnerable Bahamian islands. On September 18 and 19, while passing far to the northwest of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane, Jose's outer bands produced wind gusts as high as and nearly of rain on the islands. United States U.S. Geological Survey specialists installed 17 storm-tide sensors in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. In advance of the storm, U.S. Geological Survey specialists across three states installed 17 storm-tide sensors ‚Äì seven in Connecticut, seven in Massachusetts and three in Rhode Island ‚Äì along shorelines likely to receive some large waves and storm surge from the storm to collect information about the storm's effects. The NHC issued a tropical storm warning for portions of the Atlantic coastline, including the Outer Banks in North Carolina, through Delmarva and the Jersey Shore. Tropical storm warnings were also issued for Long Island, and the coastline of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Storm surge warnings were also posted for Nantucket, Massachusetts and parts of the Outer Banks. Hurricane Jose's wind history. On September 19, rough surf and swells from Jose flooded portions of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, causing road closures along sections of NC 12. Jose produced a storm surge along the Atlantic coast, with the highest rise recorded at in Wachapreague, Virginia. The storm brought heavy winds and rain to Ocean City, Maryland on September 19, with large waves and strong currents flooding a parking lot at the Ocean City Inlet. Sand erosion at Assateague Island National Seashore forced the closure of two parking lots, but had otherwise negligible effects. On September 19, waves from Jose breached a dune and flooded a portion of Delaware Route 1 in Sussex County, Delaware, forcing the road to be closed and traffic detoured. Large waves from Jose caused beach erosion along the Jersey Shore. In North Wildwood, waves from the storm went over a seawall and high tide caused street flooding along the bay. Damage in North Wildwood reached an estimated $2 million. Flooding from Jose shut down Ocean Drive between Avalon and Sea Isle City. One person was found unconscious after being caught in a rip current in Asbury Park; she died in the hospital the following day. While the storm meandered offshore, tropical storm conditions affected parts of coastal Massachusetts. On Nantucket, wind gusted to , and rainfall at the airport reached . Rough seas prompted suspensions of ferry service to and from the island. Similar winds affected southern Martha's Vineyard. These conditions downed trees and power lines, disrupting travel and leaving more than 43,000 people without electricity. One tree fell on a car in Plymouth, and another struck a home and nearby shed in Norton. Overall damage was relatively light, amounting to $337,000.

The neo- classical three-storey building was constructed between 1846 and 1847 to designs by the Toronto architect William Thomas (and built by Garvie and Co.) for the then Niagara District. The building replaced an earlier court house removed for fear of it being in-range of cannon fire from Fort Niagara. Inside it had a courtroom, town hall chambers, offices and jail cells. The building was used as one of a few venues for the 1850 Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West. The court-house function remained until judicial courts moved to St. Catharines in 1863; the building then served as town hall and jail until 1866. It became an orphanage for girls from England from 1869 to the early 20th century. In 1962 the court house became home to the Shaw Festival. It received designation as a National Historic Site in 1981. As of the 2018 season, it was retired as an active performance venue and re-purposed for rehearsals, training, education, and expanded audience programs. Prior Niagara court houses * Second Niagara Court House and Gaol ‚Äì built in 1817 near Rye and Cottage Streets, the Georgian building was more grand than the first and far from cannon fire from the U.S. side of the Niagara River. It was replaced by the 1847 court house. It was demolished after 1866; the site is now Rye Heritage Park, with a marker placed at the end of the driveway into the park. * First Niagara Court House and Gaol ‚Äì built in 1795 at King and Prideaux Streets (today occupied by Bernard Gray Hall Bed and Breakfast). Originally the plans were to have it built at Mississauga and Queen Streets. The court house was merely a blockhouse building and was burned by American troops in 1813.

RELIS started its service at two centres in 1995, and has since 2001 been established at university hospitals in all four health regions of Norway. All the centres are tied to the clinical pharmacology departments at the university hospitals. RELIS has a question- answer service which aids health professionals in matters of medical drugs, often specific to an individual patient. The target group and users of the service is primarily medical doctors, but also pharmacists, dentists, nurses and midwives use the service. RELIS is also responsible for an information service aided at pregnant and breastfeeding women called Trygg Mammamedisin ('Safe Mommy Medicine'). This service is accessible through its own website, and also by phone. It is open to the public and is confidential and free of charge. Another important role for RELIS is pharmacovigilance. RELIS receives adverse side effect alerts submitted by health professionals, and RELIS then judges the course and causalities of each case, and sends a written reply to the person who submitted the message. The adverse side effect reports are then registered in a national adverse side effect database, in close cooperation with the Norwegian Medicines Agency.

The concept of data sovereignty is closely linked with data security, cloud computing and technological sovereignty. Unlike technological sovereignty, which is vaguely defined and can be used as an umbrella term in policymaking, data sovereignty is specifically concerned with questions surrounding the data itself. Data sovereignty is usually discussed in two ways: in relation to Indigenous groups and Indigenous autonomy from post-colonial states or in relation to transnational data flow. With the rise of cloud computing, many countries have passed various laws around control and storage of data, which all reflects measures of data sovereignty. More than 100 countries have some sort of data sovereignty laws in place. With self-sovereign identity (SSI) the individual identity holders can fully create and control their credentials, although a nation can still issue a digital identity in that paradigm.  History  The Snowden revelations on the National Security Agency's (NSA) PRISM program provided a catalyst for global data sovereignty discussions. It was revealed that the US was collecting vast swaths of data not only from American citizens, but from around the world. The program was designed ‚Äúto \\"receive\\" emails, video clips, photos, voice and video calls, social networking details, logins and other data held by a range of US internet firms‚Äù such as American tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Google and Twitter among others. In the wake of the revelations, countries became increasingly concerned with who could access their national information and its potential repercussions. Their worries were further exacerbated due to the US Patriot Act. Under the act, US officials were granted access to any information physically within the United States (such as server farms), regardless of the information's origin. This meant that any information collected by an American server would have no protection from the US government. Another instance that put data sovereignty in the news was a case between Microsoft and the US government. In 2013, the Department of Justice (DoJ) demanded that Microsoft grant the DoJ access to emails ‚Äúrelated to a narcotics case from a Hotmail account hosted in Ireland‚Äù. Microsoft refused, stating that this transfer would result in the company breaking data localization and protecting laws in the EU. The initial ruling was in favour of the US government, with Magistrate James Francis concluding that American companies ‚Äúmust turn over private information when served with a valid search warrant from US law enforcement agencies. Microsoft asked for an appeal and went to court again in 2016 with the case Microsoft v. United States. John Frank, the VP for EU Government Affairs at Microsoft stated in a 2016 blog post that a US court of appeals ruled in favour of Microsoft, supporting the notion that \\"US search warrants do not reach our customers' data stored abroad\\". On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the Department of Justice (DoJ) that represented ‚Äúmost of what Microsoft was asking for.\\"  Indigenous context  Discussions of indigenous data sovereignty for indigenous peoples of Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the United States of America are currently underway. Data sovereignty is seen by indigenous peoples and activists as a key piece to self-governance structures and important pillar of indigenous sovereignty as a whole. The decolonization of data is seen by activists as a way to give power to indigenous people to \\"determine who should be counted among them\\" and would be able to better reflect the \\"interests, values and priorities of native people\\". Scholars also argue that given the power over their own data, indigenous peoples would be able to decide which data gets disseminated to the public and what does not, a decision typically made by the settler government. In New Zealand, Te Mana Raraunga, a Maori data sovereignty network, created a charter to outline what Maori data sovereignty would look like. Some of the requests in the charter included \\"asserting Maori rights and interests in relation to data\\", \\"advocating for Maori involvement in the governance of data repositories\\" and \\"Supporting the development of Maori data infrastructure and security systems\\". In Canada, Gwen Phillips of the Ktunaxa nation of British Columbia has been advocating for Ktunaxa data sovereignty and other pathways towards self-governance in the community. National data sovereignty measures Canada has enacted various data sovereignty measures, primarily on storage of Canadian data on Canadian servers. As part of Canada's IT strategy for the years 2016‚Äì2020, data localization measures were discussed as a way to uphold citizens' privacy. By using Canadian servers to store Canadian data as opposed to American servers, this would safeguard Canadian data from being subject to the US Patriot Act. In 2017, it was discovered that Shared Services Canada and the Communications Security Establishment were \\"exploring options for sensitive data storage on U.S.-based servers\\" with Microsoft\\". Also in 2016 the EU Parliament approved their own data sovereignty measures within a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulatory package homogenizes data protection policy for all European Union members. It also includes an addendum that establishes extraterritorial jurisdiction for its rules to extend to any data controller or processor whose subjects are EU citizens, regardless of the location the holding or processing is conducted. This forces companies based outside of the EU to reevaluate their sitewide policies and align them with another country's law. The GDPR also effectively replaced the 1995 European Data Protection Directive that had originally established the free movement of personal data between member state borders, and in doing so granted interoperability of such data among nearly thirty countries.  Criticism  A common criticism of data sovereignty brought forward by corporate actors is that it impedes and has the potential to destroy processes in cloud computing. Since cloud storage might be dispersed and disseminated in a variety of locations at any given time, it is argued that governance of cloud computing is difficult under data sovereignty laws. For example, data held in the cloud may be illegal in some jurisdictions but legal in others.

Family Lucien Moreau was born in 1875, son of √âmile Moreau (1841‚Äì1919). He was the grand-nephew of Augustin Boyer, brother-in-law and partner of Pierre Larousse, the creator of the Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle. At the end of the 19th century his father √âmile, uncles Auguste and Georges and their cousin Cition owned a third of the thriving √âditions Larousse publishing house. Lucien Moreau was raised in a progressive environment, was not baptised, and as an adolescent was attracted to libertarian anarchism. Around 1900 he said he was \\"not a Christian at all\\". Moreau was the best friend of the Jewish playwright Edmond Fleg (1874‚Äì1963). They agreed that Jewish and French nationalisms \\"traveled in parallel lines\\", and rejected assimilation. From 1909 Lucien Moreau was in charge of the printing press of Larousse. Action Fran√ßaise Moreau was a personal friend of Charles Maurras, whom he met in 1892 when Moreau was editorial secretary of the Revue encyclop√©dique Larousse and Maurras was a literary critic. Moreau was definitely converted to royalism by 1903. He became a regular contributor to the journal L'Action Fran√ßaise. The political organization of Henri Vaugeois's Action Fran√ßaise movement, the Ligue d'Action Fran√ßaise, was launched in the spring of 1905, as was the Action Fran√ßaise Federation of Students, directed by Lucien Moreau. Members pledged to fight the republican regime and to support restoration of the monarchy under Prince Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans (1869‚Äì1926). From 1906 Moreau was president of the √âtudiants d'Action fran√ßaise. Moreau was not particularly interested in creating a coup d'etat, but was mainly interested in organization and teaching doctrine. He originated the concept of the Institut d'Action fran√ßaise, which arranged conferences and trained party cadres. In 1906 Moreau was given a tenured chair at the Institut d'Action Fran√ßaise. As professor of French nationalist he expounded the policy of the Action Fran√ßaise to doubters. On 16 November 1908 Moreau and Maurice Pujo created the Camelots du Roi youth movement. From 1908 Moreau and Jean Rivain were the pillars of the La Revue critique des id√©es et des livres. In 1920 Moreau initiated the expansion of the Institut d'Action Fran√ßaise into the provinces. From 1927 to 1932 he was director of the Soci√©t√© de librairie, d'enseignement et de publicit√© of the Action fran√ßaise. Lucien Moreau died in 1932.

It explains the various errors, misquotations, misinterpretations and misleading statements found in various curriculum textbooks taught in Pakistan. The first edition was published in 1985 under the banners of Vanguard books and the second edition came out in 1993. About the author Khursheed Kamal Aziz, popularly known as KK Aziz, was a historian in Pakistan. He received his early education from the MB High School in Batala, now in Indian Punjab, and then went to Forman Christian College and finally to Government College Lahore for graduation where one of his professors was the famed Patras Bokhari. Later he completed his studies at Victoria University in Manchester, UK. Aziz taught at various institutions such as the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford, UK, and at universities in Heidelberg, Germany as well as in Khartoum, Sudan and the Punjab University in Lahore, Pakistan. He also delivered occasional lectures at universities in Pakistan: Karachi, Peshawar, Islamabad; Bangladesh: Dacca; United Kingdom: Hull, New Castle upon Tyne and Oxford; Switzerland: Geneva and Bergen. He worked briefly, in the early 1970s, as an advisor to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and was the chairman of the 'National Commission on Historical and Cultural Research'. But he later fell out with the Bhutto government and left that position. Some years later, he returned his \\"Sitara-i-Imtiaz\\" medal awarded by the President of Pakistan, protesting his treatment by the martial law authorities after General Zia-ul-Haq seized power in 1977, and was forced to leave the country. He lived many years abroad as an exile and taught at many universities abroad. He began to collect his research material for his many famous books while he was teaching in Germany. His research material was enriched by the experiences he had while living in different countries. Events In 1985, when the first edition of the book was published, it did not do well partially because of the regime of General Zia-ul-haq, of which he was a staunch critic. He was still staying with his brother-in-law in Lahore's Model Town neighborhood when in 1993 the second edition of The Murder of History was published. This time the book did relatively well. This started an intellectual trend in Pakistan and after that similar kinds of works started publishing because of the restoration of the normal political process in the country.  Contents  The contents of the book are listed here: * The Prescribed Myths * The Calamity of Errors * The Road to Ruin * The Burden of Responsibility Description First of all the author has quoted a long list of blunders that are printed in textbooks that are enforced as part of the national curriculum by the government of Pakistan. According to the writer, the textbooks are full of factual errors. In fact, they are just a collection of misquotations, misinterpretations, self-serving and self-supporting statements, one-sided viewpoints, slanted opinions, half-truths and blatant lies. For example, the textbooks claim that the famous Lahore Resolution or Pakistan Resolution was passed on March 23, 1940 and on the basis of this, March 23 is called the Pakistan Day and is celebrated as a national holiday. The author proves that the resolution that was passed on March 24. Similarly, he says that Pakistan came into being on August 15, 1947, not on August 14, 1947. He also claimed that he was real author of Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi's book The Struggle for Pakistan. Mr. Qureshi indirectly accepted this fact in his preface to the book, he once said in the 1990s. \\"However, if were to write this book today, I would write differently.\\" Aftermath The third edition of Murder of History came out in 2010, and is now widely quoted by noted Pakistani and Western historians. Also, ever since his death, a series of books authored by Aziz have appeared. The history sections of book stores across Pakistan now carry a number of works authored by Aziz, something that was almost inconceivable even till the mid-1990s.

Wigwe as a social enterprise managed from inception by current COO, Antonia Ally, it was set to make meaningful contributions to global development through unconventional focus on leadership, health and youth empowerment.  Aims  The foundation aims to *(i) contribute towards the global efforts being made on malaria eradication in Nigeria, *(ii) generate more National awareness on Prostate Cancer *(iii) develop programs and schemes to support underserved youths.  Foundation Programs  *GMNP - Give Malaria No Place: In 2016, The HOW Foundation in partnership with Doctors Save A Life Foundation coined the ‚ÄòGive Malaria No Place‚Äô (GMNP) Initiative and developed a powerful ‚Äú2 Step‚Äù Solution in an effort to contribute to the global and national fight against malaria. The two-step solution was to first educate and then do diagnostics and distribution of malaria preventive tools. It was launched in May 2016, at the founder's hometown, Isiokpo in Rivers State, distributing millions of mosquito nets, malaria medicines as well as education on proper malaria preventive habits. It embarked on the second leg in February 2017. In a bit to raise awareness on Malaria Prevention habits via social media, the foundation held a competition encouraging people to post creative videos explaining what they felt was the biggest contributing factor to malaria in Nigeria and the solution. * Leadership and Mentorship Seminars: In October 2016, the foundation partnered with U.K. Based motivational speaker, Joshua Ajitena and coined \\"Be The Best\\", a yearly motivational seminar aimed at students in government owned secondary schools. The motivational seminars are focused on presenting practical methods the kids can adapt to overcome obstacles in today's social and economic environment. The hope is to encourage a diversification of job descriptions and a broader spectrum of future employment opportunities and development. *Prostate Cancer Awareness Campaigns: The statistics behind prostate cancer amongst black people is alarming. The Founder realised the issue was not amplified in comparison to its threat. The foundation has observed that many Nigerians can not identify the prostate, even more are not aware of the risks, over half of Prostate Cancer diagnosis in Nigerian men is found during the final stages of the cancer. In September 2017, to mark Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, the foundation kicked off a new initiative to the cause, \\"Blue-State Charity Football Match For Prostate Cancer Awareness. *Others: On Saturday 24 June 2017, the partnership with RCCG on the God‚Äôs Children Great Talent Show (a music talent show for children), Season 7 was concluded, in a continual bit to support and encourage underserved youth to strive to achieve their passion.

ACEL, founded in 1984 is the roofing bond of Luxemburgish student unions and represents more than 40 student unions, all spread across Europe. Therefore, ACEL is representing more than 10000 Luxemburgish students. It is hence considered as the most important student representative in Luxemburg. ACEL is politically non-committed, it represents no party opinion. Claiming to be the representative of all Luxemburgish students, this is particularly important to function properly.  Description  The major part of Luxemburgish Students study abroad, as the studies offered in Luxemburg are limited and do not cover all academic fields of study. This situation is unique and has several benefits, including the foundation of Luxemburgish Student Unions across various European cities. The student unions constitute the active members of ACEL, covering 9 countries; Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Luxemburg, The Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. These student unions receive and unite fellow Luxemburgish students during their academic studies. Besides ACEL counts 9 specific student unions among its members (Medicine, Economics, Law, Psychology, Literature, Engineering, History, Communication and BTS students ). Since its foundation, ACEL has defined its own purposes: * The Information of the Luxemburgish students and the future students * The Pooling of Luxemburgish Students, abroad or in Luxemburg * The Representation of the Luxemburgish students and defense of their rights on national as well as on international political stage  Student Unions   Specific  * ALEM Medical students * ALEP Psychology students * ANEIL Engineering students * ANELD Association nationale des Etudiants luxembourgeois en Droit * ANESEC Association nationale des Etudiants en Sciences Econmiques * elSiC Etudiants luxembourgeois en Sciences de l'Information et de la Communication * Historic.ul Association des Etudiants en Histoire de l'Universit√© du Luxembourg * Jonk BAD Librarianship students * LBS BTS students  Countries  = Austria = * LSI Innsbruck * LSW Vienna = Belgium = * CELB Brussels * CELBas Bastogne * LESTLE Li√®ge * Nei-Leiwener Louvain-la-Neuve = France = * AELP Paris * ALUS Strasbourg * CELG Grenobel * CELM Montpellier * ELAN Nancy * Letz'Aix Aix-en-Provence = Germany = * AELK Karlsruhe * ALESONTIA Bonn * AVL Aachen * LSB Bingen * LSC Cologne * LSD D√ºsseldorf * LSH Heidelberg * LSHH Hamburg * LSK Kaiserslautern * LSM Munich * LSRM Rhein-Main * LSS Saarbr√ºcken * LST Treves * LSW√º W√ºrzburg * SLUF Freiburg * VLIB Berlin = Great-Britain = * LSA Aberdeen * SLSB Students in Great Britain = Luxemburg = * CEFT Belval * CEST Science-, Technology- and Communication- Students * LSU Differdange = Netherlands = * LSNL Students in the Netherlands = Switzerland = * AELL Lausanne * Fribl√´tz Fribourg * LSBe Bern * LSSG St. Gallen * LSZ Zurich = USA = * LUAM Miami University, Oxford = Others = * aAcel Alumni of ACEL * REEL Organisational committee of the REEL  Information  One of the main goals of ACEL is to inform the students. In order to do so, ACEL publishes yearly its Guide of the future Graduate, which aims to facilitate student's entry onto the job market. Furthermore, ACEL also tries to inform the future students and this via its Guide of the future Student. Published first in 1987, it appears yearly in September and delivers practical information on the different cities and their universities. It is realized together with ACEL's different member unions and tries to answer questions related to housing, registration and what to look out for in general as a student. The Guide of the future Graduate, published first in 1999, pools all the necessary information for a successful entry upon the job market. It is published annually in the autumn with the Guide of the future student. Both guides are free and retrievable from ACEL itself and the CEDIES. Besides the 2 Guides, ACEL also publishes its Zoom, which is published yearly for the Student fair. This publication consists of a review of the ongoing academic year and the activities of ACEL. Within one encounters the experiences and the different projects of the member student unions, as well as information concerning the latter. ACEL presents itself is an informational booklet on the different activities of ACEL and its main goals. Besides its publications, ACEL participates in the different study fairs organized by the Luxemburgish secondary schools and tries to answer the pupils' questions regarding their future academic studies. Furthermore, ACEL also organizes yearly its Student for one day. During these day trips to different cities and their universities, which are organized together with ACEL's member unions, pupils get the chance to have a first hands on experience of the different cities, the universities, the student unions as well as the various fields of studies. The choices taken by the pupils during their last year of secondary school may define their future and ACEL tries to give them a deep insight into the life as a student during the Student for one day.  Pooling  The information and the political representation of the Luxemburgish students are ACEL's defining goals, but those two wouldn't be achievable without the aid of its member unions. In order to maintain the positive relation between ACEL and its members, the pooling pillar tries to regroup Luxemburgish students as well in Luxemburg as abroad. This goal is achieved via different events throughout the academic year  De Studentebal  The Students' Ball is unique in its nature. Thanks to its organizational form, it has established itself as the biggest open air student ball in Luxemburg. Together with ACEL, more than 20 of its member unions are present and propose the different typical drinks of their cities of study in a creatively designed environment. The event enables the Luxemburgish student, who throughout the academic year are spread across Europe, to get together. The different member unions participate in the raising and the truing of the site and the benefice is fairly divided among the participating students unions. With the generated profit the different student unions are able to propose different activities to their members in the following year.  Tournoi de No√´l / Christmas Tournament  During the Christmas Holiday, the different member unions of ACEL compete each other in a sports tournament, which includes football, basketball and volleyball. The ranks on the campus Geessekn√§ppchen in Luxemburg-city are always filled. Even if the competing teams always give their fullest, amusement and sportsmanship are the most important traits of the tournament. ACEL takes care of the organizational aspects of the championship and the LASEL ( the Luxemburgish secondary school sports federation ) organizes the athletic aspects of the tournament. The generated profit is contributed as donation to a good cause.  Intercercles and balls  Throughout the academic year, the student unions organize various events with different activities. During an event, a so-called intercercle, the organizing student union offers for example a cultural activity or a culinary one for which it invites the other student unions of ACEL to join. The background idea is to create get-togethers for students. ACEL offers sponsoring to the organizing student unions.  Representation  As important as the information and the pooling of the students is their political representation and the defence of their rights on the national as well as on an international level. Within this political context, ACEL fosters a constant dialogue with the responsible Ministries, as for example the Ministry of higher education. ACEL also represents its members among the Council on higher education and the Financial Aid Committee. For several years ACEL invests itself into a constructive dialogue with the Luxemburgish political powers to discuss the themes most mattering for students. It is in this context that ACEL has been able to achieve in 2016 an increase of the financial aid given to the Luxemburgish students by the government. Furthermore, ACEL has managed to achieve that Luxemburgish students pursuing their studies in France or Germany are freed of paying fees such as the GEZ in Germany or the taxe d'habitation in France.
