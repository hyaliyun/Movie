It consisted mostly of the Khoi chiefdoms (Gonaqua, Hoengeniqua, Inqua and others) that had been displaced by colonists and became incorporated into the Xhosa nation. Khwane kaLungane, a counselor and warrior under King Tshiwo, was chosen to lead the new chiefdom. This marked the start of his Khwane dynasty, which would lead the chiefdom for decades. The chiefdom spanned from the Buffalo River to Zwaartkops, but most of its territory was lost after the Xhosa Wars and was given to colony settlers (west of the Fish River) and the Fengu people (between the Fish and Keiskamma rivers) by the colonial government. The chiefdom gradually grew more homogeneous, until a divide occurred when two members of the leading family, Pato and Kama, split and settled different areas of the region. In addition, Kama converted to Christianity, which further alienated himself from the royal family. Later, Kama was recognized by the Cape Colony as the true leader of the chiefdom, possibly due to his religious conversion.

It is found on a golden buckled bowl or cup which is among the pieces of the Treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The bowl is 12 cm in diameter and weighs 212 g, and has a handle or buckle, perhaps for hanging on a belt. The inscription is found around the outside of a circular design in the middle of the bowl. In the place where the inscription begins and ends, there is a cross. The inscription reads: .Gyula Moravcsik, Byzantinoturcica: Sprachreste der T√ºrkv√∂lker in den byzantinischen Quellen (1983) Prevailing opinion is that the language of the text is a Turkic language, and several translations have been proposed, though none are agreed upon. Vilhelm Thomsen translated the inscription: \\"Boila zoapan finished this bowl [this drinking cup], which Boutaoul zoapan made suitable for hanging up.\\"according to Gyula L√°szl√≥ and Istv√°n R√°cz (The treasure of Nagyszentmiklo≈õ, 1984) Nikola Mavrodinov translated it: \\"Bouila zoapan made this cup; Boutaul Zoapan made this cup suitable for drinking from.\\" Gyula N√©meth translated it: \\"Boila chaban's bowl, which was made to his order; Boutaoul had a buckle made for it, and this is his bowl.\\" Paul LazƒÉr Tonciulescu translated it: \\"Jupan Buila [has] all rights, jupan Butaul [has the right of] entering [in] all towns.Paul LazƒÉr Tonciulescu - \\"De la »öara Luanei la Ieud\\", Editura Miracol, Bucure»ôti, 1998 Description The treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s The treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s, of which the bowl is a part, consists of 23 decorated gold vessels weighing around 10 kg. It was found in 1799 on the banks of the Aranca river, near Nagyszentmikl√≥s (today S√¢nnicolau Mare in Timi»ô County, Romania), in the region of Avar settlement in the Carpathian Basin. It was also attributed to the lower Danube Bulgars, but the current view is that the treasure is of Avar origin and closely related to the Avar culture. The objects were made by specialized craftsmen in the 7th and 8th centuries and were hoarded by local lords. The treasure was last \\"used\\" and buried in the second half of the 8th century or perhaps in the early 9th century. Some of the vessels bear runiform inscriptions. Similar characters can be found on a bone needle case excavated in the Late Avar cemetery of Szarvas (in B√©k√©s County, Hungary) and dated to the second half of the 8th century. Based on this evidence, some scholars proposed a similar date for the Nagyszentmikl√≥s inscriptions. The inscription A drawing of the inscription made by J√≥zsef Hampel. The Buyla inscription is engraved in Greek letters on the inner bottom of a round buckled bowl (no. 21 in J√≥zsef Hampel's list), on a flat ring surrounding a lavishly decorated disk. The inscription has the following text, easily readable, and uses a 'C'-shaped glyph for sigma: :: ‚Ä† ŒíŒüŒ•ŒóŒõŒë ‚Ä¢ ŒñŒüŒëŒ†ŒëŒù ‚Ä¢ Œ§ŒïœπŒó ‚Ä¢ ŒîŒ•ŒìŒïŒ§ŒüŒôŒìŒó ‚Ä¢ ŒíŒüŒ•Œ§ŒëŒüŒ•Œõ ‚Ä¢ ŒñŒ©ŒëŒ†ŒëŒù ‚Ä¢ Œ§ŒëŒìŒ°ŒüŒìŒó ‚Ä¢ ŒóŒ§ŒñŒôŒìŒó ‚Ä¢ Œ§ŒëŒôœπŒó The lower case equivalent is: :: ‚Ä† Œ≤ŒøœÖŒ∑ŒªŒ± ‚Ä¢ Œ∂ŒøŒ±œÄŒ±ŒΩ ‚Ä¢ œÑŒµœÉŒ∑ ‚Ä¢ Œ¥œÖŒ≥ŒµœÑŒøŒπŒ≥Œ∑ ‚Ä¢ Œ≤ŒøœÖœÑŒ±ŒøœÖŒª ‚Ä¢ Œ∂œâŒ±œÄŒ±ŒΩ ‚Ä¢ œÑŒ±Œ≥œÅŒøŒ≥Œ∑ ‚Ä¢ Œ∑œÑŒ∂ŒπŒ≥Œ∑ ‚Ä¢ œÑŒ±ŒπœÉŒ∑ The transliteration is: :: ‚Ä† bouƒìla ‚Ä¢ zoapan ‚Ä¢ tesƒì ‚Ä¢ dugetoigƒì ‚Ä¢ boutaoul ‚Ä¢ z≈çapan ‚Ä¢ tagrogƒì ‚Ä¢ ƒìtzigƒì ‚Ä¢ taisƒì Paleographic and epigraphic considerations Some of the letters of the inscription have distinctive shapes. The letters sigma and epsilon have broad arcs. The base line of delta juts out on both sides. Beta has also a prominent base line, a form found in the Greek inscriptions from Bulgaria dated to the early 9th century, but otherwise it is rarely attested in the Greek-writing world: only on several Cherson coins of the Byzantine emperor Basil I (867-886) and also on one inscription of the same emperor, found in Mesembria (today Nesebar, Bulgaria). The shape of alpha is also attested on the 9th century Greek inscriptions from Bulgaria. On the other hand, omega's unusual shape, with a middle vertical line higher than the rounded sides, is specific for the 6th century Greek inscriptions and the oldest forms of the Greek Uncial script. =Vowels= In this inscription there is a free alternation between Œµ and Œ±Œπ, Œ∑ and Œπ, and Œø and œâ. These groups became homophones in Koine Greek, merging to , and . Also ŒøœÖ was read , œÖ was read , and ŒøŒπ was read either or . Interpretations In the late 19th century, J√≥zsef Hampel suggested that the treasure of Nagyszentmikl√≥s was buried by Gepids in the 4th or 5th century AD, and attempted to decipher the text of the inscription using the Greek language. Three words end in -Œ≥Œ∑, which was read by Hampel as the Greek Œ≥·øÜ = \\"land, country\\". He concluded that the inscription records two Gepid princes, Bouila and Boutaoul, and the three lands they ruled: Tagro, Etzi and Dygetoi. The last toponym was connected with the Getae of the Classical Antiquity. This interpretation was sharply criticized by Vilhelm Thomsen and Gyula N√©meth, who showed that the language of the inscription cannot be Greek, but an old Turkic language. Today almost all scholars share the view that the text was written in a Turkic language, but it has not been deciphered and the exact classification of the language has been a subject of debate. It has been often compared with the Turkic Bulgar language of the First Bulgarian Empire, attested on several 8th-9th century inscriptions found in north-eastern Bulgaria and written in Greek letters. More recently Eugene Helimski argued the language is close to Proto-Tungusic, but this proposal was rejected by Marcel Erdal as far-fetched. Buyla It is generally agreed that the first word is the Turkic title buyla or boyla (also spelled boila) which is attested on several Old Turkic and Danube Bulgar inscriptions and also mentioned by some 9th and 10th centuries Byzantine authors. Some scholars proposed that Buyla should be read as a personal name in this text. Butaul Butaul is usually read as a personal name. It may be interpreted as \\"son of Buta\\" with the final -ul being a development of the Turkic oƒüul = \\"son\\". This etymology was challenged based on the observation that according to the predominant model of construction of Turkic patronymics, the possessive forms oƒülu or oƒüli are expected. Based on the names attested on Old Turkic inscriptions, Erdal posited the reading But Aul. Zoapan In 1900, Karl Brugmann derived the Common Slavic *≈æupan—ä from ≈æupa \\"district, small administrative region\\", an etymology that was accepted by many linguists. However, others suggested the opposite evolution: ≈æupa as a back formation from ≈æupan, a title of Iranian etymological origin, generally found among Slavs. References Bibliography     http://bolgnames.com/Images/Treasure_1.pdf http://bolgnames.com/Images/Treasure_2.pdf Archaeology of Romania Collections of the Kunsthistorisches Museum History of Banat Inscriptions of disputed origin Inscriptions in unknown languages Proto-Bulgar inscriptions Turkic inscriptions Migration Period ","title":"Buyla inscription"},{"id":"34134809","text":"Peace is a psychological fantasy/ghost story novel by American writer Gene Wolfe, published in 1975. It is the story of a man from a small Midwestern town in the early to mid-20th century, Alden Dennis Weer, who narrates various memories from different parts of his life, including his childhood, early adulthood, and middle to old age. Style and interpretations Unlike a lot of Wolfe's work Peace is a standalone novel set in a somewhat contemporary time and place (as opposed to the future or an imaginary world). Despite this, the story of the novel is one of Wolfe's strangest and most difficult; the narrator's consciousness at times seems to transcend time and space, as if he's narrating from beyond our plane of reality. One interpretation is that the narrator, Weer, is dead, and the scattered memories are those of a ghost; in 2014, Wolfe confirmed that this was his intention.A Q&A; with Gene Wolfe, by Jason Pontin; in MIT Technology Review; published July 24, 2014 Different critics interpret differently what is actually happening in the novel, and another interpretation is that the memories of his old age are the fantasies of a middle-aged Weer, who is experiencing a nervous breakdown. The novel includes subtle clues to guide the reader's understanding of the story, although the mysteries behind these clues have been hotly debated.Mordicai Knode, \\"Gene Wolfe's Peace Will Leave You Anything But Peaceful,\\" Tor.com, October 26, 2012. Retrieved 2013-10-22. As in many of Wolfe's novels, much of Peace is taken up with stories within stories, particularly stories told to Weer as a child. Many of the key events of the novel are not explicitly narrated, but can be inferred or guessed at based on information in the stories-within-stories. Commentary Wolfe has described Peace as his favorite of his own work, as it is the one where he came closest to achieving his original goals. Neil Gaiman, who has frequently praised the novel, said: \\"Peace really was a gentle Midwestern memoir the first time I read it.

Sussex Parish Churches It is built of stone rubble with ashlar dressings, the porch is of brick and the roofs are tiled. Originally the Chancel extended beyond the bounds of the existing east wall. There were two Chantry chapels and, possibly, two aisles built in the 14th century. There was also a vestry to the north of the Chapel area. The north chapel and part of the Chancel were allowed to fall into ruin, probably in the early 16th century, but were rebuilt, using much of the original materials, shortly after 1660. During this rebuilding, the east window was moved to the current position, giving the church the unusual T-shape it has now. The church has a prominent tower. The Chancel area is traditionally, the responsibility of the Vicar, the remainder of the building being that of the Church Wardens. It seems possible that, at some time, there was a disagreement about this since, to make it absolutely clear two small stones inscribed, \\"Chancel Boundary, 1814\\" were inserted in the eastern columns. The niches (or piscinas), adjacent to the Altar, are original and were used for the cleansing of the Holy vessels, after celebration of the Holy Communion. An aumbry has been built into the wall, adjacent to the Altar, to keep the Blessed sacrament. During the Middle Ages, the nave must have been very dark, as the only light came from the three narrow windows in both the north and south walls and two in the west wall. In 1596, three of these windows were converted to oblong windows. The font, adjacent to this window, is about the same age as the church and is typical of early Sussex work. It was removed from the church, during the Civil War and its weather-beaten and rather battered appearance may be the result of it having been buried during this time. It was re-erected in 1660. There is a drain, from the font, which discharges just above the tiled floor. An Edict requires that the water in the font, which has been blessed, should be collected and cast away outside the church. In the old days, it was suspected that if this action was not taken, the water might be used for witchcraft purposes. In the 18th century, side galleries and large box pews were constructed the incisions to support the galleries can be seen, cut into pillars. It seems likely that, to compensate for the reduction of light, led to the villagers subscribing to the splendid brass candelabrum, installed in 1750. There is an iron screen, dating from 1815, in the north chapel, that is a fine example of the work of Sussex blacksmiths. The brick north porch and segment-headed doorway are late 18th century. On 3 September 2017, the Bishop of Chichester opened the Parish rooms, a building adjacent to the church. The purpose of the rooms, according to the St Mary's website, is to provide 21st- century facilities to the church. The rooms provide: *Lavatories *A small catering facility and running water *Sunday School facilities and small hall *Parish office *Storage. Music In the 15th century, the tower was added, complete with a minstrel's gallery; at the same time bells were hung, music for the services would have been provided by a village orchestra, comprising flute, fife, bassoon and fiddle. In 1850, a harmonium replaced the orchestra to provide music in the church. The current organ, in the organ loft at the west end of the church, came from the Chapel of St Luke in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford and is a 2 manual instrument by G M Holdich. In its former location in Oxford the organ was regularly played by the pianist and composer Jack Gibbons who as a child held the position of organist at the Radcliffe Infirmary's St Luke's Chapel. The church has both a junior and adult choir for the services.St Mary's music pages.

He was an artillery commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from October 1946 to October 1948. Early life When he studied at Xuzhou Peixin Middle School, he was expelled from academic status. After that, he went to study in Nanjing. In the summer of 1924, he joined the Socialist Youth League. In the same year, he was admitted into Guangdong University. In 1925, he passed an entrance examination of Zhongshan University in Moscow. After his graduation from Zhongshan University in 1927, he furthered his studies in artillery barracks in the Soviet Union. In 1928, he joined the Communist Party of Soviet Union, and then switched to Chinese Communist Party. In 1929, Zhu came back to China. He was once Chinese special correspondent, the chief of Red Army‚Äôs general headquarters, a teacher of Red Army‚Äôs schools, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau so on. At the end of the year 1932, he was appointed as Red Army Committee. In August, 1934, he was appointed as political director of legion one. Then he joined the Red Army. A pocket watch Zhu Rui used. After the Anti-Japanese War (1937-1945), Zhu led teachers and students of Yanan artillery school to the Northeast, collecting weapons abandoned by Japanese soldiers and developing artillery (troops) actively. In 1946Ôºå he took on the position of Artillery Commander and the president of artillery school.

He was one of the principal architects of the distinctive sound of West Coast 1970s pop and rock, after which he moved into production, eventually becoming President of Warner Bros. Records Nashville. Following a retirement period beginning in 2004, he re-emerged in Nashville in 2010. Early career Norman's career began in earnest when he joined Don Henley in Texas-based group Felicity in 1969, playing keyboards and guitar. Having renamed themselves Shiloh and by now based in Los Angeles, they recorded an eponymous album (1970, Amos Records) which bore early signs of the direction in which 1970s country-rock would soon move en masse. The album was produced by Kenny Rogers but following its release, the group disbanded. Norman resurfaced a couple of years later with Uncle Jim's Music, a group who combined West Coast and country music leanings. Norman joined the band after the release of their first album, contributing to their second collection for Kapp Records, There's A Song in This.Uncle Jim's Music Rate Your Music Music and arrangement career Norman contributed string arrangements and piano to a series of bestselling albums by the Eagles, released between 1973 and 1980 including Desperado, One of These Nights and Hotel California. During the same period he wrote string and horn arrangements for Linda Ronstadt's album, Don't Cry Now and Hat Trick ‚Äì America's third studio album (released on Warner Bros). He would continue to accrue arrangement credits throughout his career and well into its next phase in Nashville. Production career In the mid-seventies, Norman emerged as a producer of note. Among the albums he helmed, and which featured his smooth stylistic qualities, were song-writing legend Jackie DeShannon's You're The Only Dancer (Amherst, 1977) and Quick Touches (Amherst, 1978), the first of which restored DeShannon to the pop charts with the spirited anthem \\"Don't Let The Flame Burn Out\\". Other production jobs included albums by New Riders of the Purple Sage, Glenn Frey, The Osmonds, and Jennifer Warnes's first hit, \\"Right Time of the Night\\" (US #6). In addition, Norman's production techniques were enlisted repeatedly for one artist in particular ‚Äì he oversaw a large chunk of Anne Murray's platinum-selling output from 1977 onwards, including Let's Keep It That Way, New Kind of Feeling, and I'll Always Love You. Notoriously hard-to-please critic, Robert Christgau, credited these albums with Murray's \\"gradual revitilazation...\\" thanks to Jim Ed Norman's \\"...clean, honest, Nashville-quality work\\".Anne Murray reviews Robert Christgau The albums were platinum-selling successes, spawning multiple hit singles including the US No. 1, Grammy winning (Female Pop Vocal Performance) \\"You Needed Me\\" and a string of US AC chart-toppers ‚Äì \\"I Just Fall in Love Again\\", \\"Shadows in the Moonlight\\", \\"Broken Hearted Me\\", and \\"Daydream Believer\\". Norman's fruitful alliance with Murray extended well into the 1980s during which he produced the Gold-selling albums A Little Good News and Heart Over Mind, both of which won CMA awards. While Norman had been known for providing arrangements and keyboards on albums that typified the lush, Californian sound of the seventies, as a producer his natural inclination towards country music became increasingly prominent through his work with such artists as Kenny Rogers and Hank Williams Jr. By the outset of the nineties, Nashville was the place to be for a migration of Singer/Songwriters from Los Angeles, and the city gradually became known for music that mixed country with the folk and soul leanings brought by the influx. In 1990 Norman added his expertise to this emergent trend, producing the breakthrough self-titled Warner Bros/Reprise album by singer/songwriter Beth Nielsen Chapman, which was very much in the singer/songwriter blend of styles. He resumed duties for Nielsen Chapman's follow-up album You Hold the Key (Warner Reprise, 1993). Time at Warner Nashville After joining Warner Bros. Nashville as Head of A&R;, Norman was awarded Presidency of the company in 1984. There, he was responsible for nurturing the talents of Randy Travis, Faith Hill, Travis Tritt, and Dwight Yoakam. His new role was also notable for the fact that it did not curtail his direct creative involvement in music, and he continued to amass production credits throughout his time with the label, as well as undertaking arrangements for non-Warners artists. Among those he worked with at the time were Crystal Gayle, Kenny Rogers, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood.Stark, Phyllis Nashville Scene Diversity at Warner Bros. Norman was influential at Warner Bros. Nashville, demonstrating an inclination to increase the company's range of genres. To this end, he was involved in the successful expansion of the label's reach to include the WB Gospel and Christian division, and the launches of the Warner Western imprint, featuring Native American and Cowboy artists, and a Hispanic label ‚Äì Warner Discos. In addition, Norman spearheaded the Progressive division, with artists including Take 6, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Mark O'Connor and American guitar virtuoso Shawn Lane. Retirement and re-emergence Norman's retirement was confirmed on June 14, 2004, and shortly thereafter he relocated to Hawaii. Despite ostensibly retiring, he swiftly became involved in music again, organizing a music business program between the University of Hawaii and Belmont University, Nashville. In a short space of time, he was widely noted for his largesse, commitment to and support of local talent, which also benefitted Honolulu Community College, with the creation of the MELE program. In 2010, however, he broke his retirement and returned to Nashville, initially working on the debut album by Nashville Star contestant Christy McDonald, the first of a series of new production assignments which also included newcomers, Dylan Scott and Tim Dugger. He continues to encourage and support education via his involvement as Senior Fellow at The Curb Center for Art, Enterprise & Public Policy at Vanderbilt. In 2011, reports that he would be working with Rounder recording artist Claire Lynch began to emerge.Howard Heithau, Harriet Claire Lynch brings bluegrass charm to the Stage In 2014 it was reported that Norman was named the unique title of Chief Creative Officer of Curb Records. Just a year later, in 2015, Jim Ed Norman became the CEO of The Curb Group. The Curb Group is involved in the music industry, philanthropy, and motorsports. Awards and philanthropy Jim Ed Norman was surprised with the Bob Kingsley Living Legend Award February 24, 2016 on stage at the Grand Ole Opry House. The award is annually presented to someone who has made a lasting impact on the country music business. Kingsley, a famed radio personality, received the inaugural award in 2014 and Joe Galante, former head of Sony Music Nashville, was honored in 2015. The award was presented during a dinner to benefit The Opry Trust Fund. Following dinner, artists including Big & Rich, Don Henley, Mickey Gilley, Michael Martin Murphy, TG Sheppard, Gary Morris, Crystal Gayle, Mo Pitney, Jeff Hanna, Brice and Kenny Rogers paid tribute to Norman. And, Randy Travis made an unannounced rare public appearance. The Tennessean Jim Ed Norman was the Founding President of Leadership Music, an organisation that brings together music industry personnel, encouraging community spirit, education, the cross-pollination of ideas, and issue-based interaction.

Smith Nashville Community Music School, which provides private music instruction for low income families given by an all-volunteer faculty at 50 cents a lesson Norman was named Producer of the Year by Cashbox in 1989 for his work with Crystal Gayle among others. In 1990, he was given the Andrew Heiskell Community Service Award ‚Äì a Time Warner award designed to recognise those who have contributed outstanding degrees of community service. In 1993, Norman received the Anti-Defamation League Johnny Cash Americanism Award, given to recognise individuals who have fought against racism, prejudice and bigotry.Gores To Receive Award AllBusiness In acknowledgement of his efforts to link the Nashville community at large with the entertainment industry, Norman was given the Leadership Music Bridge Award (subsequently renamed the Dale Franklin Leadership Music Award) in 1996.

He made 46 total appearances during his first season at the club, in which the club finished in second place in the Superliga and reached the Danish Cup final, where they lost 3‚Äì1 to rivals FC Copenhagen. In the following season, R√∂cker was again a starter in central defense, this time alongside Hj√∂rtur Hermannsson or Paulus Arajuuri, as Br√∏ndby were contenders for the league title throughout the season. However, in decisive games against eventual champions FC Midtjylland, as well as AC Horsens, Br√∏ndby's lead in the table was lost and they finished in second place. They had more success in the Danish Cup, with R√∂cker scoring a crucial goal as Br√∏ndby beat Silkeborg IF 3‚Äì1 in the final to claim the trophy. Personally, he had a strong season with 40 total appearances in which he scored five goals. In January 2019, R√∂cker was appointed team captain of Br√∏ndby following the departure of Johan Larsson. He was, however, benched in the second half of the season, as Br√∏ndby dismissed head coach Zorniger and the club finished in fourth place. R√∂cker made 25 appearances during his final season at the club in which he scored one goal, as his contract expired at the end of the season. Wehen Wiesbaden On 13 June 2019, R√∂cker joined newly promoted 2. Bundesliga club SV Wehen Wiesbaden on a two-year contract, on a free transfer. He made 21 total appearances during the season in which he scored one goal, as Wehen Wiesbaden finished 17th in the league table and suffered relegation to the 3. Liga.

Pragya implements projects in the high altitude Himalayan regions of India and Nepal, and the highlands and savannahs of East Africa. Pragya's aim is to shape and enable holistic, sustainable development with a focus on the vulnerable and neglected communities and ecosystems in remote and hard to reach areas of the world. It works with marginalized communities focusing on social development, natural resource management, appropriate technology and enterprise development. History Pragya in KenyaPragya was founded in 1995 to address the acute issues of poverty and marginalisation that face indigenous communities in the high altitude Indian Himalayas. Since then, Pragya has worked to protect the natural environment of the Himalayas and support the people who depend on this fragile ecosystem. Pragya is an alliance of practitioners bonded together by a commitment to the cause. Pragya's early work focused on managing the vulnerable ecological systems and preserving the culture of the communities within the Indian Himalayas. Pragya has been successful in developing solving problems such as the reduction of available water and medicinal plants and livelihood options. The geographic focus has now expanded to include working within hard to reach areas in Nepal and East Africa. Pragya is conducting research and delivering services within the fields of education, health, water and sanitation, natural resource management, renewable energy, women's empowerment, and sustainable livelihoods. Programmes A women's self-help group in the HimalayasPragya's work engages with the specific needs and challenges facing people in some of the most remote and ecologically sensitive areas of the world. The aims of these projects is to build the skills of people within the local communities so they can live independently and enjoy a fruitful livelihood. The projects also provide them with security and access to adequate facilities for health and education. It also helps these communities find ways to make use of the natural resources available to them, helping to preserve the balance between local communities and their fragile natural environment. Pragya focuses on research and advocacy to highlight the needs of people in these very marginal areas so that they have the opportunity to be included within mainstream development. In 2011 projects have directly benefited 31,583 people in the Himalayan region in 2010-11. 21,570 (68.2%) of these were children. Apart from this, Pragya projects reached 700,000 people including 490,000 children. Social Development Projects Education and information facilities - Pragya has been developing alternative learning centres and libraries for remote and marginalized communities that remain excluded from mainstream education. 112 education centres, 38 resource centres (19 IT-enabled) are serving to reduce the education and information gap in the Himalayas and Sub Saharan Africa. Pragya has piloted several innovations to reach quality education to the marginalised communities, and have been internationally recognised for its efforts. Basic welfare services for migrant workers in the Himalayas - Pragya is implementing a programme to address the basic welfare needs of migrant labourers working on road construction/maintenance in the high altitude Himalayas. Creches deliver early childhood care and ‚Äòschools on wheels‚Äô (mobile vans with computers and learning toys) provide primary education to the children in the labour camps. Protective gears, water filters and health camps are ensuring improved health, while advocacy is working towards long-term benefits. A migrant road worker in the Central Himalayashttp://andrewaitchison.photoshelter.com/gallery/India- Pragya-2010/G0000LoHEmuK8dvM Community managed resource centres - Integrated community development is being facilitated through community resource centres. These centres are equipped with libraries, computers, databases for marketing and government support and facilities for training and vocational skill- building. Health and nutrition for disadvantaged communities - Pragya has been working to improve the nutritional and health status of rural communities. The work addresses critical levels of malnutrition and associated health problems in the region. A pilot scheme in Nepal is now being expanded to Indian Himalayashttp://www.ashmorefoundation.org/grants-partners/grants/health/pragya and Kenyan Arid and Semi Arid provinces. Livelihoods and income generation - Pragya is developing 16 enterprises, 95 women's self-help groups, and more than 45 small enterprises and cooperatives. It has also set up buyer-seller linkages, production and sales centres in the region. For increasing visibility of local heritage based enterprises, 15 heritage museums/eco-trails have also been set up. Rights awareness and advocacy - Pragya is working to enhance participation in democratic processes among indigenous tribes to empower marginalized groups. Local representatives and leaders have been elected to enhance civil society engagement. Development media has been promoted through citizen journalism and people-state interfaces. Pragya has held more than 20 national/regional advocacy events. It has developed and anchored the High Himalaya Forum and Himalayan Heritage Network as effective advocacy platforms. Natural resource management and appropriate technology projects Pragya adapts available technologies (such as for water and energy) to tune them to the geographical context of the regions Pragya work in. It is important to make the available technologies more suitable for rural application. Renewable energy - Pragya has designed a decentralised renewable energy application for remote villages as most of these villages had remained without electricity. Pragya also set up two of the highest solar-wind hybrid systems in the world. The model has been incorporated in the Government of India policy for rural electrification.http://www.himalayanvoices.org/sites/default/files/Common%20Energy%20Facilities%20_0.pdf A combined wind/Solar power system providing electricity for the village of Lossar Medicinal plant conservation and sustainable livelihoods - A globally recognised intervention that combines conservation of medicinal herbs while growing them as cash crops has benefitted Himalayan farmers and Pragya is currently using the same model in East Africa. Pragya developed cultivation protocols through rigorous research at their Germ plasm banks and 13 nurseries. Support for market linkages were provided to women's self-help groups and farmers cooperatives. The plants threatened by: deforestation, climate change, over-use and destructive harvesting are also being conserved through 11 community managed In-situ Conservation Areas, Herbal Gardens. Participatory land and water management - Six different snow and water management technologies have been developed and more than 21 sites have been set up for demonstration in the Indian and Nepal Himalayas. Over 100 structures have been set up for water to use in remote villages and nomadic groups, and nine warehouses constructed for food security.http://whitleyaward.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/110803-Project- leaflet-Water-Access-+-Wasteland-Development-in-Himalayan-Cold-Deserts.pdf Safe water and sanitation - Pragya has been working to improve the health and hygiene of the communities in the Himalayas and African arid lands, by creating facilities for enhanced access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. A blend of traditional knowledge and scientific inputs, tested and perfected over past years, has been applied for the revitalisation of natural springs used as drinking water source, water storage and most importantly filtration systems have been established in most water-starved villages. Masons and women's groups are trained for maintenance and replication. Pragya's relief and rehabilitation efforts In August 2010, a cloudburst in the Ladakh Himalayas triggered flashfloods across the region and caused several deaths, massive destruction of property and infrastructure and much misery to the Ladakhis. Dozens of NGOs provided basic relief work and rescue including Pragya. Pragya conducted a rapid assessment of immediate local needs and stepped in with an appeal for relief, and funds raised contributed to water and sanitation facilities for victims, provision of medical help and other relief material, and months of intensive relief work. Pragya's efforts were recognised by the national government and the district administration in Ladakh. The floods damaged the town, 40 surrounding villages and devastated community structures affecting the storage of food items. Pragya established prefabricated weather proof insulated warehouses for food storage in association with Care today, Comic Relief and Big Lottery Fund. Pragya is now helping re-build the life of the residents in remote villages in Leh through a dedicated three-year programme. The Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh were hit by torrential rain, landslides and flash floods on 14‚Äì17 June 2013. The Pragya ground staff in Chamoli, Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag (Uttarakhand) and Kinnaur (Himachal Pradesh) worked to provide humanitarian support, as the team in Gurgaon sent across necessary relief material. We have supplied food to relief camps and medicines to health department. Blankets, tarpaulins, tents, water purification tablets, medicines, ration, hygiene kits have been reaching remote villages and stationery items, tents and teaching aids have been provided to schools damaged by the flood. Pragya staff have also provided coordination & IT support at the District Administration facilitated Control Room at Joshimath. Thanks to our supporters we were able to provide: 17 consignments of medicines, 4103 blankets and bedsheets, 81000+ packets of food items, 5199 kg food grains, 74000 water purification tablets, 4579 personal hygiene items, 443 tarpaulins to the flood affected people.http://pragya.org/doc/Outreach_Summary.pdfhttp://pragya.org/images/New%20Folder/print_media_thumbnail/Asian_Age.JPG Pragya is currently running Mobile Health Vans in 2 districts to address health concerns and has initiated rehabilitation measures for livelihood, education, water and sanitation provisions in 4 districts of Uttarakhand. The team also recorded its learnings and brought out a set of recommendations for a Himalaya Adapted disaster Management strategy. From Pragya's flood relief work.

It was the residence of Antoni Gaud√≠ for almost 20 years, from 1906 till the end of 1925. On 28 September 1963 it opened as a historic home museum.  History  At the end of the 19th century, Catalan industrialist Eusebi G√ºell i Bacigalupi, after a stay in England, returned to Barcelona with the intention to build a garden city for the Catalan bourgeoisie, on the grounds of the property Can Muntaner de Dalt, which he had acquired in 1899. He commissioned the project, which envisaged the construction of sixty houses with garden and all the services necessary, to Antoni Gaud√≠. In 1914 the works were stopped and the project was not completed. Only two of the houses envisaged were finally built: doctor Trias i Dom√®nech‚Äôs House and what is nowadays Gaud√≠ House-Museum which had to serve as a lure for potential land-buyers. These houses were added to the old house, that already existed in the place and whose owner was Eusebi G√ºell himself. The model property, designed by architect Francesc Berenguer i Mestres, built by contractor Josep Casanovas i Pardo and signed by Gaud√≠ himself, was built between 1903 and 1905. It was on sale but it attracted no purchasers. In 1906, Gaud√≠ bought the house and lived there with his father and niece. His father died that very same year, and his niece in 1912. Since then, Gaud√≠ lived there alone until the end of 1925, when, a few months before his death in 1926, moved to the workshop of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia Basilica. In his will, the architect donated the house to the Foundation Board of La Sagrada Fam√≠lia, which sold it to the Chiappo Arietti couple. In 1960 the Friends of Gaud√≠ association started a campaign so as to purchase the house to the Chiappo Arietti‚Äôs descendants in order to convert it into a museum. Three years later, it opened as Gaud√≠ House-Museum. Josep Maria Garrut had been its chairman since the museum opened to the public until his death in 2008. In 1992 the house was donated to the Construction Board of La Sagrada Fam√≠lia Foundation.  The building  The building has four floors. The ground and first floors are dedicated to the collection opened to the public. The basement is not open to the public and the second floor houses the Enric Casanelles Library, which can be accessed with prior permission. As for the collection, some rooms, such as the bedroom, the study or the inner door, as well as some personal Gaud√≠ belongings, evoke memories of when the architect lived in this house. They also host a great exhibition of furniture designed by Gaud√≠ for buildings such as Casa Batll√≥, Casa Calvet, Casa Mil√†, Casa Vicens or the Col√≤nia G√ºell‚Äôs crypt, that along with the wrought iron elements also designed by the architect - exhibited in the garden- are the most valuable objects of the collection. The collection also includes furniture, sculptures, paintings, drawings and other objects of Gaud√≠ coworkers that are exhibited in several rooms of the museum.

Since 2013 Richardson has played international cricket for Australia in both One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals, and as a teenager he played for Australia's Under-19 team, winning the 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup with them. Richardson is a right-arm fast bowler from country South Australia. He has struggled over the years for consistency in first-class matches, but is widely regarded as a white ball specialist due to his successes in the shorter forms of the game. In addition to being a skilled bowler he is a competent batsman and an athletic fielder. Career Youth career (2008‚Äì2010) Richardson was born in Eudunda in country South Australia, but he spent much of his childhood in Darwin in the Northern Territory. He moved back to South Australia to play for the Southern Redbacks, making his Twenty20 debut in the 2008‚Äì09 Big Bash and his one-day debut in the 2008‚Äì09 Ford Ranger Cup. In 2009 Richardson was named in Australia's under-19 squad for their tour of India ahead of the 2010 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. While on tour in India he managed a five-wicket haul in a youth test against India. After the tour he went with the team to Kenya to play in the World Cup. He played three matches in the tournament and impressed with both bat and ball. His first standout performance came against Ireland, when he scored 23 runs from 14 balls and took three wickets with the new ball to help Australia to a crushing 209-run victory. He was brought into the team for the final of the World Cup against Pakistan, top-scoring with 44 runs to help Australia to their third Under-19 World Cup title. During his youth career Richardson played in two youth Test matches and ten youth One Day Internationals (ODI). Continued career and international debut (2010‚Äì2013) Richardson continued to play for the Redbacks and was a crucial part of their win in the 2010‚Äì11 Big Bash, taking three key wickets against New South Wales in the final of the tournament. His form carried over into the other forms of the game in this season as well, with a man-of-the-match bowling performance against Queensland in the Ryobi Cup being followed up with his first-class debut for South Australia in the next Sheffield Shield game. He was impressive on debut, taking a wicket in each of his first three overs of first-class cricket. At the end of the season he was upgraded from a rookie contract with South Australia to a full contract for the first time, and when the Big Bash was replaced with the Big Bash League he stayed in Adelaide, playing for the new Adelaide Strikers. Richardson had a breakout season in 2012‚Äì13, particularly in the Ryobi Cup where he took 21 wickets in just five matches with a very good average of 13.8, including a six-wicket haul against Queensland. On the back of his strong performances for South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers, Richardson replaced the injured Mitchell Starc in the 2nd one day international against Sri Lanka on 13 January 2013, making his international debut. In his first One Day International he got a first ball duck lbw to Lasith Malinga and the fine figures of 6 overs 3 maidens, none for 15 runs when he was removed by umpire Marais Erasmus for repeatedly running on the pitch in his follow through. He was forced to remodel his follow through during the rest of the season, but he continued to impress in domestic cricket with a five wicket haul against Victoria and six wickets against New South Wales. IPL career and backup international bowler (2013‚Äìpresent) =Indian Premier League (2013‚Äì2014)= Richardson made international headlines when he was bought by the Pune Warriors in the 2013 IPL player's auction for $700,000, the third-highest price of any player that season despite the fact he had only played six first-class matches to that point. He went on to play just three matches for the Warriors in the 2013 season. Before the 2014 season he was bought by the Rajasthan Royals and had more success with them, playing 7 matches and taking 11 wickets. This ended up being his only season with the team as, though he was then retained by the Royals for the 2015 season, he withdrew from the tournament due to personal reasons. =Returns to international team (2014‚Äì2016)= Richardson also made up ground within the Australian national squad during 2014, playing for Australia A in a series of matches in Darwin. He had very good form, taking 13 wickets at an average of 11.30 and earning a return to Australia's ODI team for the 2014 Zimbabwe Tri-Series. He impressed Australian selectors enough to be included in both the ODI and T20I squad for Australia's matches against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. He made his Twenty20 International debut for Australia against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in October 2014. Despite his successes in 2014, Richardson was unable to secure his spot in the national side and wasn't included in the Australia A squad in 2015. Richardson made another comeback in the 2015‚Äì16 Australian summer when he was again very successful in one-day matches, being named South Australia's player of the tournament for the Matador Cup. He made his way back into the national team in January 2016, joining the ODI squad against India. His breakthrough performance came in this series, when in a match at Manuka Oval he took five wickets, causing the Indian batting order to collapse and taking Australia from a losing position to a dramatic win. After this series Richardson went with the Australian team to New Zealand, but he was withdrawn from the series due to a back injury. Later scans ruled him out of the rest of the season, meaning he missed the final four rounds of the 2015‚Äì16 Sheffield Shield season. =Further injuries and international appearances (2016‚Äìpresent)= Richardson returned from his back injury to first-class cricket for Australia A in northern Queensland in the 2016 winter, but injuries again affected him in the 2016‚Äì17 season. A hamstring injury interrupted Richardson's Matador Cup campaign and another back injury caused him to miss most of BBL06. Despite these injuries he had the most consistent Sheffield Shield season of his career, playing in eight matches for the Redbacks. Although Richardson started to find consistent form and recover from his injury problems, he was unable to gain a permanent place in Australia's national team as Australia already had four world-class fast bowlers in Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and James Pattinson. This limited Richardson's opportunities at the international level to occasions when one or more of the other fast bowlers was injured. As a result, Richardson was again included in the Australia A squad in 2017 for the 2017 South Africa A Team Tri-Series, though Australia had to pull out of the series due to a pay dispute. Despite the cancellation of the series Richardson was selected for Australia's ODI and T20I series in India when Hazlewood, Cummins and Pattinson were all simultaneously injured. In three ODIs in India he took seven wickets. After spending the first six seasons of the Big Bash League with the Adelaide Strikers, being the club's all-time leading wicket-taker taking 42 wickets in 40 Twenty20 matches for the Strikers and South Australia combined, Richardson decided he wanted a fresh start and signed a new five-year contract with the Melbourne Renegades ahead of BBL07. In April 2018, he was awarded a national contract by Cricket Australia for the 2018‚Äì19 season. In May 2019, he was added to Australia's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup, replacing Jhye Richardson, who was ruled out of the tournament with a dislocated shoulder. In February 2020, Richardson was named in Australia's ODI squad for their series against New Zealand. He missed the first match as he reported symptoms of COVID-19, though he tested negative and re-joined the squad. In April 2020, Cricket Australia awarded Richardson with a central contract ahead of the 2020‚Äì21 season. On 16 July 2020, Richardson was named in a 26-man preliminary squad of players to begin training ahead of a possible tour to England following the COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 August 2020, Cricket Australia confirmed that the fixtures would be taking place, with Richardson included in the touring party. Playing style Richardson is a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He is known for his fast pace and aggression and is skilled at bowling well-directed yorker. Richardson's bowling action is reminiscent of former Australian Test bowler Paul Reiffel. In addition to being a good bowler, Richardson is a capable batsman and an athletic fielder. He has good hands, meaning he is able to take impressive catches in the field, and he is also very fit. Richardson has done a two- kilometre time trial in 6:39, placing him among the fittest Australian cricketers. Richardson has had far more success in limited overs cricket, playing for Australia in both One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals, than in first-class cricket, as he is yet to play a Test match for Australia. This has led to him being referred to as a white ball specialist. Part of the reason for his success in shorter forms of the game is his ability to both open and close the bowling well. Veganism Richardson is a vegan, not eating animal products. Cricket balls are made with leather, an animal product, and Richardson has said that he would prefer if they were not made with leather.

North Stoneham House North Stoneham Park, also known as Stoneham Park, was a landscaped parkland and country house of the same name, north of Southampton at North Stoneham, Hampshire. It was the seat of the Fleming (subsequently Willis Fleming) family. The park was remodelled by Lancelot Brown in the 18th century. It is listed in the Hampshire Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In 2011, controversial plans were announced to build 1,300 new houses on the surviving portion, Avenue Park.' Origins The deer park at North Stoneham was probably part of a Saxon ecclesiastical estate in the early Middle Ages. Later it belonged to Hyde Abbey. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the manor was acquired in 1545 by Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton. In 1599, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton sold the North Stoneham estate to Sir Thomas Fleming, whose descendants owned it until 1953. Stoneham War Shrine The restored war shrine in 2011 Remains of the war shrine in 2009 The Stoneham War Shrine was built in 1917‚Äì18 in the Avenue Park portion of the parkland by John Willis Fleming, in memory of thirty-six local men killed in World War I, including his own son Richard. (An identical shrine was built at Havenstreet, Isle of Wight). The Stoneham War Shrine was sited on Cricketers' Hill, facing towards St. Nicolas' Church along the line of the former Avenue. The monument was designed by the architect Christopher Hatton Turnor, who had designed the Watts Gallery in Surrey. The Shrine was dedicated on 28 July 1918 by James Macarthur, Bishop of Southampton. During the late 20th century, the Shrine fell into an advanced state of dereliction. In 2011, it was restored to its original condition, and was re-dedicated on 22 May 2011. Preservation of the Avenue portion of the Park St Nicolas' church seen across the Avenue in 2011 In 1967, Pevsner described in his Buildings of England: Hampshire and the Isle of Wight how the parkland formed \\"a narrow but effective green belt between Eastleigh and Southampton\\". From 1991, Hampshire County Council recognized that efforts should be made to conserve, restore, and enhance North Stoneham Park as a viable historic and natural landscape, and commissioned a number of surveys and evaluations.; ; . Following these surveys, the need to protect and restore the remaining parkland was built into local and regional plans. The Eastleigh-Southampton Strategic Gap Planning and Management Framework (1993) set out the objectives to reduce further damage to the landscape, bring portions of land into public ownership as a ‚Äòrecreational and educational resource‚Äô, and protect and reinstate surviving features. The Framework was adopted in 1995 by Eastleigh Borough Council and Test Valley Council, and the restoration of Avenue area took place in phases between 1995 and 2011. In 1996, the southern portion (61 acres) of the Avenue was placed in public ownership. In 2000, a well-received landscape restoration project to the whole of the Avenue area, including Eastleigh Borough Council‚Äôs northern portion (13 acres). The Southern Daily Echo reported: 'The huge restoration project of the vital green lung on Easteigh's southern boundary with Southampton has been made possible through a partnership of Eastleigh council with local people.' The ¬£100,000 restoration was funded by developers' contributions following the redevelopment of North Stoneham Rectory. In 2008, Heritage Lottery-funding was awarded towards the project in order to return the Stoneham War Shrine to its original condition and further the conservation of the surrounding parkland. Plans to build 1,300 houses in the Avenue portion of the Park In 2011, Eastleigh Borough Council published the Draft Eastleigh Borough Local Plan 2011-2029, which included the recommendation that up to 1,300 houses plus community facilities should be built on the surviving Avenue area of North Stoneham Park. The designated area includes the Avenue area that was placed in public ownership in 1996 and restored in 2000. The Plan states that the area \\"is not subject to major environmental constraints\\" and that \\"it is acknowledged that it forms part of an historic landscape, but much of this has now become degraded.\\" The Council's 13-acre countryside site however would not be included: \\"The part that is of most interest (the woodland surrounding the Shrine) would be protected\\".; The plan states that \\"whilst the site was previously part of the strategic gap separating Southampton and Eastleigh, it is considered that the contribution that development on this site would make to addressing housing needs outweighs the limited erosion of this gap.\\" References Country houses in Hampshire British country houses destroyed in the 20th century Buildings and structures demolished in 1939 Borough of Eastleigh Gardens by Capability Brown ","title":"North Stoneham Park"},{"id":"34135341","text":"Buddleja davidii 'African Queen' is a cultivar raised by Dutch nurseryman W.

The infamous battle was one of the most intense for Australian forces since the Vietnam war at the time.. Background In late August at the American FOB Anaconda, a combined operation of Australians and Americans began the first patrol to \\"flush out the bad guys\\". The Australians managed to spot a party of three Taliban who were possibly organising fighters to hit the Americans who were some distance away. After the Taliban crossed the 'killing ground' where there would be no real cover for them to hide behind, the Australian snipers proceeded to engage and neutralise all three targets. American intelligence soon revealed further Taliban were coming in order to collect the dead. The Americans then changed their positions so they could observe up the valley. Right after the Taliban had stopped their vehicle, the Americans sent a volley of 40 mm grenades destroying the vehicle and its six occupants. It was later revealed that one of the Taliban inside was the eastern commander of the Taliban in that area. The ANA soldiers then proceeded to pilfer their AKs, ammunition and their webbing, and anything else of importance. An American medic treated one of the wounded Taliban and was soon released after questioning. They thought it was best to let him go to see what would develop from the coalition ambush. On the return to Anaconda, the patrol was ambushed by a handful of fighters with small enemy fire. The patrol was broadside onto the enemy and the green zone, and to the right was a large steep feature. With only one way to go the patrol turned all guns towards the enemy fire and threw everything they had. Eventually, the American JTAC called in two F/A-18 Hornets and provided two 20mm cannon runs into Taliban positions. On the first patrol a total of 11 had been killed that day. After an overnight rest, they began to gear up for the next operation the following day. Little did they know that it would turn into one of the biggest battles involving Australian troops since Vietnam. Battle A combined humvee convoy performing a routine clearance patrol exercise Trooper Mark Donaldson's medals on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. From left to right they are the Victoria Cross for Australia, Australian Active Service Medal with ICAT clasp, Afghanistan Medal, Australian Defence Medal and NATO Medal for the Non-Article 5 ISAF Operation in Afghanistan. The battle took place on 2 September 2008. After the success of a joint US-Australian ambush mission in the valley to the northeast of FOB Anaconda, the coalition force conducted a similar ambush mission in another valley to the east near a village called Ana Kalay. The mission commenced with two SASR patrols and a command element moving by foot in darkness to establish themselves in ambush positions to the north of the Ana Kalay valley. At 4 am five Humvees crewed by US Special forces of the 7th SF group and Afghan Special forces troops departed FOB Anaconda and made their way east into the Ana Kalay valley. The US/Afghan force was accompanied by the remaining two SAS patrols, two Australian SF Engineers from the Incident Response regiment and the Explosive detection dog, Sarbi. The SASR troopers joined the vehicle group to provide additional fire power for the move into the valley. The vehicle move could not be conducted under the cover of darkness, due to the Afghan SF troops not being issued with night vision equipment. The Afghan troops manned the first and last vehicles in the five Humvee convoy. Deep into the valley, both SASR patrols left the vehicles and moved into the foothills to establish themselves in southerly ambush locations. The SASR patrols were equipped with long range sniper rifles. With the ambush set, the five vehicles moved around the valley to different locations to encourage the Taliban force to deploy. The SASR force lay in wait to ambush Taliban as they infiltrated the area. The two SASR patrols to the north successfully ambushed armed Taliban as they moved into position. The southern patrols observed armed Taliban. According to Patrol Commander SGT Troy Simmonds, who commanded one of the southern patrols, in a 2013 interview for the Australian War Memorial \\"The enemy had children near them and due to the extended range and wind, we did not engage them.\\" After the engagement to the north, the northern patrols and command element commenced a foot move back over the mountains to FOB Anaconda. The vehicle element were unable to use an alternate route to return to FOB Anaconda and had to begin moving back through the enemy-controlled valley using a route similar to the one they had used to come in the valley. The two southern SASR patrols, a six-man patrol and a five-man patrol, walked down from the foothills to RV with the US SF vehicles for the extraction from the valley. The SASR hoped to provide additional firepower to assist the withdrawal. The two SASR patrols distributed themselves on the back of the centre three vehicles. Not long after the vehicles moved off from the RV, they were engaged by accurate mortar fire origination from the river valley of Ana Kalay. The mortars landed around the vehicles but no casualties were sustained. They were also attacked by accurate small arms fire. The force called in air support and ordnance was dropped on the mortar location. The vehicles were well spaced and had to slowly negotiate rocky terrain in a westerly direction with the green Ana Kalay river valley on their left and a ridge line on their right. The fire intensified and the coalition force began to take casualties. A number of SASR troops were armed with sniper rifles and they moved away from the vehicles on foot to provide support. The speed of the vehicle was very slow due to the rough terrain and much of the force being on foot. As the vehicles progressed along the valley, the fire intensified resulting in more casualties. SGT Troy Simmonds said \\"The fire was like rain on the surface of water\\". SGT 1st Class Gregory A Rodriguez K-9 unit - 527th Military Police Co, 709th Military Police BN, 18th MP Brigade, a US SF military dog handler was killed by enemy gunfire during the battle. Eventually the combined force made it out of the valley, having expended nearly all ammunition. The US SF suffered 1 x KIA and 1 x WIA. The Australian SASR troops had 9 x WIA., including both engineers. SGT Troy Simmonds revealed in his 2013 AWM interview, that of his five-man patrol, only one member was not wounded. The other 6 man SASR patrol had three members wounded... Aftermath Outcome The battle lasted over nine hours before the convoy managed to break off the action and return to the American FOB, Anaconda. They suffered heavy casualties before managing to withdraw. The infamous battle is described as a coalition defeat due to their withdrawal but the casualties sustained by the Taliban were estimated to have been up to 80 KIA, considerably greater than the casualties sustained by the coalition force.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ozlas1esE Dutch controversy An ADF report says Australian SAS and US forces were abandoned by Dutch allies during the battle in Afghanistan. A former Australian SAS sniper named Rob Maylor, wounded during the battle, said the Australians had pleaded with the Dutch saying: \\"We're in an absolute doozy of a shitfight. We need your assistance as we're taking casualties\\". But the Dutch helicopter pilots refused to offer covering for the Australian, US and Afghan troops in the ambush. The role of the Dutch in the battle was described by Maylor in his book SAS Sniper. He writes that during the battle the Australians saw two Dutch Apache helicopters escorting a Chinook and radioed the pilots to fire their Hellfire laser-guided missiles and 30 mm cannons on the Taliban. But the Dutch pilots refused to drop below , despite the Apaches being capable of operating at low levels under heavy fire.. \\"They wouldn't open up on the Taliban for fear they might draw some fire themselves,\\" Maylor said. In the end the soldier on the ground responsible for guiding air support told the Dutch: \\"If you're not going to engage then you might as well fuck off.\\" And they did, Maylor writes. Maylor's wounds from the battle were patched up by Donaldson, who was later awarded a VC for gallantry for rescuing a wounded interpreter that day.. These claims were never backed up by any official of the neither the Australian nor the Dutch MOD. The controversy did however draw a lot of attention to the publishing of Maylor's book. SGT Troy Simmonds The Patrol Commander of the forward SAS patrol in the convoy has been identified as SGT Troy Simmonds in Chris Master's book Uncommon Soldier.Allen & Unwin 9781741759716 Uncommon Soldier by Chris Masters He was shot by a ricochet in the leg during the latter stages of the battle. In a 2013 video interview for the Australian War Memorial, he recalls how after being shot in the leg, he was then blasted by an RPG explosion landing nearby. Later, he was shot through the back of his hat, his rifle was shot destroying its mechanism and he was shot through the hips. During the withdrawal from the battle, unable to climb on the back or in the vehicle, he jumped in the small space between the 'bull bar' and front of the vehicle. Still receiving heavy fire, he wrapped a heavy chain around his head to protect himself.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ozlas1esE Sgt Troy Simmonds AWM interview 2013. He explained that, now retired from the Army, he still had a Taliban bullet embedded in his pelvis. Mark Donaldson VC recipient On 2 September 2008, during the conduct of a fighting patrol, Corporal (then Trooper) Donaldson was travelling in a combined Afghan, US and Australian vehicle convoy that was engaged by a numerically superior, entrenched and coordinated enemy ambush. The ambush was initiated by a high volume of sustained machine gun fire coupled with the effective use of rocket propelled grenades. Such was the effect of the initiation that the combined patrol suffered numerous casualties, completely lost the initiative and became immediately suppressed. It was over two hours before the convoy was able to establish a clean break and move to an area free of enemy fire. Corporal Donaldson's acts of exceptional gallantry in the face of accurate and sustained enemy fire ultimately saved the life of a coalition force interpreter and ensured the safety of the other members of the combined Afghan, US and Australian force. Corporal Donaldson's actions on this day displayed exceptional courage in circumstances of great peril. His actions are of the highest accord and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the Special Operations Command, the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force.. Sarbi Sarbi is an Australian special forces explosives detection dog that spent almost 14 months missing in action (MIA) in Afghanistan after disappearing during the Battle of Khaz Oruzgan in September 2008. It is thought that a rocket explosion had scared her off after her leash was broken. She was rediscovered alive in late 2009 when an American soldier noticed Sarbi accompanying a local man. She was later flown back to the Australian base in Tarin Kowt where they confirmed it was indeed Sarbi. Her rediscovery generated worldwide news and was mentioned by Kevin Rudd, and General Stanley McChrystal. On 5 April 2011 Sarbi was awarded an RSPCA Purple Cross Award at the Australian War Memorial. The RSPCA Australia Purple Cross Award recognises the deeds of animals that have shown outstanding service to humans, particularly if they showed exceptional courage in risking their own safety or life to save a person from injury or death.

It is currently housed in a Colonial Revival brick building at the corner of Washington Avenue (New York State Route 5) and Dove Street. In 2011 that building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Young men who had recently graduated from college founded the club in the early 20th century as a place to gather until they had achieved the social status necessary to follow their fathers into the older Fort Orange Club. It met in one founder's house for several years until it could purchase a house that stood at the current location, on which it built a wing. When that house burned down in the 1920s, Albany architects the Fuller & Robinson company designed the current main building to replace it. It was his last major work in the city. The club has played a role in the city's social and cultural life since its founding. Speakers at its events in its early years included President William Howard Taft, Andrew Carnegie, Earl Grey and various governors of New York. Its amenities include a library, dining facilities, meeting rooms, and one of the oldest bowling alleys in the country, which may also be the oldest private bowling alley in continual use in the state. Buildings and grounds The club's complex occupies the three buildings on the lot along Dove between Washington and Elk Street, at the northwest corner of the intersection. The neighborhood is in a very densely developed section of Albany just two blocks west of the state capitol, a National Historic Landmark located in the Lafayette Park Historic District, also listed on the National Register. One block to the east is the State Department of Education building, another listed property. In the blocks around the club are many commercial and institutional buildings, some listed on the Register as well. Across Dove Street are the Classical Revival Harmanus Bleecker Library and Albany Institute of History and Art, both with portions designed by Albert Fuller as well. A block west at Lark Street (U.S. Route 9W) is the Washington Avenue Armory. Across Washington Avenue from the armory is the Walter Merchant House. The Alfred E. Smith State Office Building towers to the southeast at the corner of Washington and South Swan Street, dwarfed in turn by the modern Empire State Plaza to its southeast. North of Elk Street is Sheridan Park, with a large parking area in the center. South of Washington are the residential blocks of the Center Square/Hudson‚ÄìPark Historic District. The Washington Park Historic District, Albany's largest, is to the southwest on the other side of Lark. The proposed Lower Washington Avenue Historic District would include the buildings across the street from the club. Exterior The main club building is a three-story five-by-five-bay structure of brick laid in Flemish bond with wooden trim on a raised limestone basement topped by a flat roof. A two-story wing, with a one-story wing of its own, projects to the north along Dove. At the north end of the main block, a set of steps lead up from the street, which has no sidewalk, to an elaborate entrance portico. Low hedges set off the property at the corner and for a short distance north of the main entrance. Fenestration begins with recessed glass block windows in the basement. Above them, on the first story, 12-over-16 double-hung sash windows are set in recessed arched openings with keystones and splayed-brick lintels. At the lower end are ornate iron balustrades. A molded limestone stringcourse runs around the building at the level of the balustrades' top. On the second floor are eight-over-eight double-hung sash with the same lintel treatment and stone sills. A squared limestone stringcourse serves as the sill for the slightly smaller but otherwise similar windows on the third floor. Above them is a classically decorated frieze, with a wide modillioned cornice marking the roofline. The two northern bays of the east (front) facade are given over to the main entrance portico. Four clusters of paired round fluted Ionic columns, with the two on the sides having a third, topped by a classical entablature and frieze, support a flat roof with iron balustrade. A Palladian- style window, with French door, opens on to the balcony. Above it on the third story is a blind bay. To the north the two-story wing continues the brickwork and window treatment on the main block, minus the recessed arches on the first story, except in the northern two of its eight bays. At its roof is the same cornice treatment as that found on the main block, but without the frieze. It is topped with a short parapet; a large brick chimney pierces the roof near the north end. On the one-story wing, formerly a porch, this detail is further reduced, with the cornice giving way to a flush limestone stringcourse. There is also only a single rectangular window on the basement, fully exposed at this point. Interior The main entrance opens into a mid-floor vestibule with a marble floor and short stairs leading up and down. In the former direction, the basement has a large lounge, bar and dining area in the front, with terrazzo flooring and a four-lane bowling alley in the rear. The remaining space is given over to restrooms, storage and maintenance facilities. Up the steps is a lounge with fireplace. On its west is the large living room and meeting space that runs the full length of that side of the building. It has full-height windows and a fireplace. Other decoration includes projecting chimney breasts, engaged pilasters, molded shadow box panels, broad crown moldings and encased ceiling beams. Medallions representing the alma maters of the founding members form a frieze on some walls. In the rear is the large main dining room and its supporting kitchen, as well as the club's office and library. The Terrace Room runs along the rear facade. On the second floor, reached by either the main or secondary stair, is the President's Room and billiards room in the front of the building, along with more office and restroom space. In the rear wing are 13 sleeping rooms, with closets but without private bathrooms. The third floor has 10 more sleeping rooms, three of which have their own bathrooms. A rear door leads onto the roof. Outbuildings At the north end of the property are two additional buildings, both used by the club. They are separated from it by a stretch of lawn. Both have been extensively altered and are not considered contributing resources to the National Register listing. The first is a three- story brick structure that houses the club's squash courts. North of it, at the corner of Dove and Elk, is a two-and-a-half-story wood frame barn. Both were originally used as carriage houses for the late 19th-century mansion that was the original clubhouse. History The club was formed in 1901 by several young men from prominent and wealthy Albany families. They had all returned to the city after graduating from college, and wanted to get together occasionally and continue some aspects of their undergraduate experience such as singing and talking together, following the lead of other similar groups at the time in cities such as Chicago and San Francisco. Their fathers were, for the most part, members of the Fort Orange Club, Albany's oldest gentlemen's club, whose clubhouse is located a block to the east along Washington Avenue from the current site. The young men who founded the University Club assumed that, eventually, they would follow in their fathers' footsteps and join the Fort Orange Club when they reached sufficient age, and hoped that the University Club would establish itself as a junior to the Fort Orange Club. That latter organization was one of four prominent clubs in the city at the time, all of which had a waiting list for membership at least three years long. As such, any new club would have to have a distinctive feature to attract members. After two meetings at the old Albany Academy building in Lafayette Park attracted 140 interested young men, the club was incorporated and chartered. Nineteen members were elected as officers and directors, per the new organization's constitution, which limited the club to 175 members in residence. All had to be graduates of a college or university of recognized standing, or the U.S. Military or Naval academies. Its stated aims were \\"to establish and maintain a library, assembly and reading rooms; to promote social discourse among its members and to maintain and cultivate university spirit in the city of Albany.\\" They chose as their motto the Latin phrase Sapere Aude ‚Äî Incipe, meaning \\"Dare to be wise ‚Äî Begin\\". The entrance fee was $25 ($ in modern dollars) for residents and $15 ($ in modern dollars) for non- residents. Annual dues were $30 ($ in modern dollars) for residents and $15 for non-residents. Unlike other clubs the latter requirement did not stipulate a time for which the applicant had to have lived in the city. Within two months the club had found its first building, a former residence at 99 Washington Avenue. Six years later, the club bought another former residence at the current location, previously the home of the late George Amsdell, owner of Albany's largest brewery at that time. It set about spending $10,000 ($ in modern dollars) to remodel the three-bay Queen Anne style structure with a prominent angular, turreted bay for use as a clubhouse. This new home served the club well, as it enabled the launch of a speaker's series in 1908. The club entertained guest speakers such as Andrew Carnegie and Governor Charles Evan Hughes the following year. In 1910 two of the speakers chosen became major Albany events. President William Howard Taft accepted the group's invitation to one of its dinners, and the whole city welcomed him. People came from miles around to see Taft. Also present was Earl Grey, then governor- general of Canada. More than 300 attended the club's annual dinner at the Ten Eyck Hotel, leading the Times Union to claim that \\"probably more distinguished men were at the speaker's table than at any other banquet ever held in Albany.\\" The club's success brought with it the need to expand its space. By 1913 it had 335 total members. The following year it began construction of what is now the north wing in order to provide space for a restaurant and additional sleeping rooms. As general contractor, the club chose the Hoggson Brothers firm of New York. The Hoggsons, both Yale graduates, had handled the 1914 construction of the north wing. Their firm pioneered the concept of combining design and construction, including many building trades, in one company. Their new wing, with brick surfaces, clean lines, symmetries and flat roof, was a radical change from the asymmetric, angular and irregular building it was attached to. Over the next three years the club modified its membership requirements in response to World War I. A 1915 amendment to its constitution permitted recent graduates to defer half their entrance fees and dues for up to three years after graduation. Another amendment the following year created associate memberships, for those with a business in the city but living outside its boundaries. Finally, in 1917, with U.S. entry into the war, the club voted to excuse any member absent by virtue of military service outside the city from paying dues for the duration of hostilities. In 1923, the main clubhouse was damaged in a fire. It remained standing and structurally sound, but enough of the interior was exposed to the elements during the subsequent winter that the club decided to replace it. Bids were sought from three different firms; the firm of Fuller & Robinson received the commission. Albert Fuller, cofounder of the firm, had enjoyed a long and distinguished career in Albany. Either by himself or with different firms, he had designed a number of the city's notable buildings during that period, many today listed on the National Register. Around the same time, he was building the Harmanus Bleecker Library across Dove Street, a brick Classical Revival structure that complements the club buildings, and his Renaissance Revival 1908 Albany Institute of History and Art building directly opposite the club. For the club, he produced a building that was far more sympathetic to the ten-year-old wing than the original building. It would be his last major work in Albany, as he died ten years later. W.G. Sheehan, the contractors, began work as soon as the bid was awarded with the goal of opening the new building by summer of 1925. During construction, the club added to its punch list a refrigeration plant and fire alarm system. The job's final cost was $185,000 ($ in modern dollars), more than twice the original budget. A grand reopening was held in May 1925. By autumn it was apparent that it had been a success, as October and November were the best months for business the club had recorded up to that point. Membership and amenities The University Club now admits women as members. Applicants must still have graduated from a recognized college or university, although some memberships have been set aside for those who have not. Prospective members must be sponsored by two members and meet with the membership committee before being approved by the board. There are several classes of membership. The primary one is resident membership, for those who live in the counties that constitute the greater Capital District (Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady and Schoharie counties). Those residents who live close enough to the club (the Albany neighborhoods of Center Square/Hudson‚ÄìPark, Mansion, Washington Park or Park South) to be eligible for neighbor memberships pay the lowest fees and dues. Non-resident members also pay less. There are also joint memberships for married couples, clergy and corporate memberships and junior memberships for those under 35. Members are able to take advantage of the club's dining facilities, which come without a monthly minimum. They also have access to a billiards room and bowling alley. The latter hosts both open bowling and league nights. Free Wi- Fi is available throughout the building. Members also get reciprocal privileges at over a hundred other private clubs throughout the country.

He was later a partner in the firm Saxby and Farmer. Biography Saxby was born at Brighton on 17 August 1821 and in 1834 was apprenticed at the age of thirteen to a carpenter and joiner. In 1840 he was employed as a carpenter at the Brighton railway works of the London and Brighton Railway to make oak mile-posts, and where he designed a tool to automate their production. He later became the foreman of the carpenters and joiners, sawyers, pattern makers, plumbers, gas-fitters, and labourers at the works. Railway Signalling Saxby interlocking Frame, preserved in France, Gare de N√Æmes Two accidents took place on the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) during the early 1850s due to signalling failures. Saxby became interested in railway safety and invented an improved signalling lamp, giving considerable benefits and savings on the lamps then in use. He also invented a device for interlocking points and signals. In 1856 he was awarded a patent for this invention which was designed to act at once upon all the points and signals at a railway junction. Not only were the points and signals activated, but all the other signals in the system were locked against improper use. The first interlocked signalling system was installed at the Bricklayers Arms junction, near the Old Kent Road in South London. It consisted of eight semaphore signals and six pairs of points controlling the routes in and out of London bridge Station and neighbouring goods yards, with linkages to a signal box. Saxby and Farmer The signal box at Crawley built by Saxby and Farmer in 1877 In 1861 Saxby left the railway employment and started his own business at Haywards Heath to manufacture signalling apparatus. The following year he was joined in partnership by John Stinson Farmer, who had previously been an assistant to the manager of the LBSCR. Saxby and Farmer became the leading manufacturers of railway signalling equipment and established a works at Kilburn where they eventually employed 3,000 workers. The firm also established works at Brussels. In 1868 the company also constructed the world's first traffic signal for road traffic in London's George Street, working to the designs of the South-Eastern Railway engineer John Peake Knight. In 1875 firm brought out its first mechanical brake, which gave more powerful braking by connecting each vehicle's brakes together. Saxby's son James established a signal works at Creil near Paris in 1878. From the 1860s to the 1880s Saxby and Farmer were the dominant force in railway signalling equipment manufacture. Much of the equipment they provided survived in use for the greater part of the twentieth century. Signal boxes Saxby and Farmer became the major contractor responsible for building signal boxes on behalf of railways. The Type 5 design was one of the most successful and long-lived of all contractors‚Äô signal box designs, between 1876 and 1898 with eleven examples still in use on Network Rail and a further ten on heritage railways or otherwise preserved. The partnership with Farmer ended in 1888 and the French works became part of John Saxby Ltd in 1889. In 1901 the British company that Saxby founded merged with several rivals to create the Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd. The French company is now part of United Technologies Corporation. John Saxby died at Hassocks, Sussex on 22 April 1913. He is commemorated with a modern plaque in Brighton Station.

He translated and helped publication of the Chinese editions of Fishes of the World (2nd edition, by Joseph S. Nelson) and Fish Migration (a popular science book by Russian zoologist Peter Schmidt). Li was the major author of two published volumes in the Fauna Sinica monograph series, systematically reviewing and describing orders of bony fishes that include flat fish, cod, silverside, pearlfish, killifish, flying fish, etc. in or near China.Li, S.Z., Wang, H.M.: Fauna Sinica, Osteichthyes: Pleuronectiformes, Science Press, Beijing, 1995Li, S.Z., Zhang, C.G.: Fauna Sinica, Osteichthyes: Atheriniformes, Cyprinodontiformes, Beloniformes, Ophidiiformes, Gadiformes, Science Press, Beijing, 2011. He had written over 40 popular science articles about fish on Chinese newspapers and magazines, and been responsible for compiling and editing fish-related entries in several standard reference books (including Encyclopedia of China). Career and research Right after finishing graduate studies in ichthyology in 1950, Li initially worked on Chinese nomenclature of vertebrates, specializing in fishes, within the publication office of the newly-formed Chinese Academy of Sciences. Later in the year, he joined a team of zoologists (including Tso-hsin Cheng) engaged in consolidating and sorting out zoological specimen inherited from Fan Memorial Institute of Biology and National Academy of Peiping, two predecessors of the Academy of Sciences, in preparation of the later formation of the Institute of Zoology. Starting from the early 1950s, Li helped to initiate and participated in China's systematic surveys of marine fishes in Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and South China Sea, along China's coast. His scientific career, however, was interrupted in 1957 when he was labelled a \\"rightist\\" during the Anti-Rightist Movement. From then until the mid-1970s, while his research and publication capacity had been severely impacted by whims of political campaigns and turmoils, he managed to conduct surveys of freshwater fishes in the Yellow River, Ou River and Ling River, as well as in interior regions such as Xinjiang and Gansu provinces. While blacklisted as a \\"rightist\\" and assigned to work on aquaculture-related research in the early 1960s, he discovered a salmonid fish serendipitously in the vicinity of Qinling Mountains (considered to be a glacial refugium roughly in central part of China), which is later named Brachymystax tsinlingensis Li, 1966. For a relatively tranquil period of about a year before the Cultural Revolution, he was allowed to publish research results related to the salmonid fish, fishes in the Yellow River, and earlier surveys of marine fishes. But only until after the Cultural Revolution, Li was able to resume normal research activities. In his book Studies on zoogeographical divisions for fresh water fishes of China, Li divided the fauna of freshwater fishes in China into five major regions based on characteristics of fish species distributions, geographic environments and geological histories of these regions. According to his method, the demarcation line between Holarctic and Indomalayan realms in China, as far as freshwater fishes are concerned, lies largely along the Himalayas and Nanling Mountains ranges. This contrasts with the prevalent view of demarcation line between Holarctic and Indomalaya regions along the Qinling Mountains, even though the latter does not extend into Eastern part of China.Li, Sizhong: Studies on zoogeographical divisions for fresh water fishes of China (in Chinese), Science Press, Beijing, 1981 Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (FEOW), a collaborative global biodiversity project partly sponsored by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), cites this book as a source of references in delineation of freshwater ecoregions of China.Freshwater Ecoregions Of the World - FEOW: Bibliography Two of his books are published posthumously. In Fishes of the Yellow River and Beyond, he described over 170 native fish species and the characteristics of fish distribution in the Yellow River and its tributaries; a collection of his papers and popular science articles, as well as a personal memoir, are also included in the posthumous book published in Taiwan; this book was re- published in the mainland in 2017. Comparing fish species in the Yellow River in 2010‚Äì2015 and the survey results originally reported by Li in 1965 as part of his research on the book, a recent study by a Chinese team concludes that only about half of the native fishes in the Yellow River could still be found, due to anthropogenic environmental alterations and increased presence of introduced species over the past half-century. Li was also the primary contributor to a volume of the Fauna Sinica series covering the orders of Atheriniformes, Cyprinodontiformes, Beloniformes, Ophidiiformes and Gadiformes, which was published posthumously in 2011. Another volume of the Fauna Sinica series which he worked on during his last years, covering fish species in China within the orders of Beryciformes, Zeiformes, Lampriformes, Gasterosteiformes, Mugiliformes and Synbranchiformes (such as soldierfish, dory, opah, ribbonfish, stickleback, mullet, swamp eel, etc.), is yet to be published.‰∏≠ÂõΩÂä®Áâ©ÂøóÂá∫Áâà‰ø°ÊÅØ: Osteichthyes: Beryciformes-Synbranchiformes Fish species discovered or named Footnotes 1921 births 2009 deaths Chinese ichthyologists Writers from Xinxiang People's Republic of China science writers Victims of the Cultural Revolution Biologists from Henan Beijing Normal University alumni People of the Republic of China People from Huixian 20th-century zoologists ","title":"Li Sizhong (ichthyologist)"},{"id":"34135794","text":"Pseudoricia sibyllae is a moth of the family Notodontidae first described by Herbert Druce in 1885.

The text says: \\"This week it is your turn\\" The Swabian or W√ºrttembergische Kehrwoche (week of sweeping) began at the end of the 15th century in W√ºrttemberg, to improve household cleanliness. In its original form, it imposed duties on individual households regarding order and cleanliness inside the common property within the building, like staircases or entrances, as well as outside the house, especially on public pathways and places adjacent to the house. It was a weekly duty, taken in turns, on Saturday. History Stuttgart's municipal law from 1492 states, \\"To ensure that the city stays clean, everyone should remove their soil, (...) from your own street corner every 14 days, although only at night. Those who do not have a privy, must bring the waste to the stream.\\" In the 18th century, a new law, the \\"clean alley regulation\\" came about, that added detail. In 1988 the kehrwoche was abolished as a communal law. It doesn't apply to public order in any part of Baden-Wurtemberg, but it can be part of house rules and rental contracts. The communal order obliges every owner of a house to hold parts of his property, like entrance areas and access paths as well as the public pavements free of dirt, snow and ice. There is no determined time or interval, making it a permanent obligation, contrary to the weekly duty on Saturdays as in the tradition of the kehrwoche. Situation today In W√ºrttemberg, as generally in Germany and other countries, it is typical to include the cleaning activities in the rental agreement, describing which parties on which days clean the pavement, shovel snow and clean the staircases. Also a sign displaying the bolded letters \\"Kehrwoche\\" is often hung on the door of the party responsible for the Kehrwoche activities of the week. The rental owner as well as the other tenants can see who is responsible for such tasks. Agreements distinguish between \\"small\\" and \\"large\\" kehrwoche. Small kehrwoche includes hallways and staircases. Large kehrwoche includes the pavement in front of the house. Outside W√ºrttemberg, the cleaning of multi-tenant property is organised very similarly, using \\"large and small house rules\\" with identical meaning, as long as the delegation of cleaning responsibilities is not given to costly outside vendors or building superintendent. The Kehrwoche is often cited as something highly characteristic of Swabians or of Wurttemberg, often seen as proving their pettifogging obsession with order. In actual fact it proves to be more of a myth, or a projection of a German characteristic on one particular of its ethnic subgroups.

It was previously known as Ostertagia circumcincta and is colloquially known as the brown stomach worm. It is common in cool, temperate areas, such as south-eastern and south-western Australia and the United Kingdom. There is considerable variation among lambs and kids in susceptibility to infection. Much of the variation is genetic and influences the immune response. The parasite induces a type I hypersensitivity response which is responsible for the relative protein deficiency which is characteristic of severely infected animals. There are mechanistic mathematical models which can predict the course of infection. There are a variety of ways to control the infection and a combination of control measures is likely to provide the most effective and sustainable control.  Taxonomy  Teladorsagia is a member of the subfamily Ostertagiiniae in the family Trichostrongylidae and the superfamily Trichostrongyloidea. Ostertagia, Haemonchus and Graphidium are closely related taxa that are usually assigned to separate subfamilies. Teladorsagia davtiani and Teladorsagia trifurcata are probably phenotypic variants (morphotypes).  Morphology  Adults are slender with a short buccal cavity and are ruddy brown in colour. The average worm size varies considerably among sheep. Females range in size from 0.6 to 1.2 cm with males typically about 20% smaller.  Life cycle  The life cycle is relatively simple. Male and female adults breed on the abomasal surface. Eggs are passed in the faeces and develop through first (L1), second (L2) and third stage larvae (L3). Third stage larvae are unable to feed and are the infective stage. Following ingestion, third-stage larvae rapidly moult within 48 hours into fourth stage larvae (L4) which develop in the gastric glands. About 8 days after infection, the young adults emerge from the gastric glands, mature and breed. The prepatent period can be as short as 12 days. The number of eggs in the uterus of mature females can vary from less than 10 to more than 60 and is heavily dependent on the host immune response. The number of eggs produced per day by an adult female worm has been estimated as ranging from 0 to approximately 350, with longer females laying more eggs.  Epidemiology  It is responsible for considerable economic losses in sheep. It is believed to also cause severe losses in goats although there is a relative dearth of research in this species. In most countries, infection with third-stage larvae resumes in the spring and is triggered by the production of large numbers of eggs by periparturient females. The key trigger appears to be a relative protein deficiency in the ewe and the periparturient rise may be prevented by feeding supplementary protein. In the stereotypical pattern, egg production (assessed by faecal egg counts in the lambs) rises till midsummer then declines. The development of free-living nematodes is influenced by temperature and moisture and there is considerable variation within and among among years in the number of infective larvae available for ingestion. Consequently, the pattern of egg production during the year also varies among years. The number of infective larvae gradually dies down at the end of the grazing season when grass growth also declines. The end of the season varies among countries depending upon their climate and is also likely to vary from year to year within countries depending upon local weather but is poorly documented. For example, in Scotland, the season usually ends about late October. There is considerable variation among animals in faecal egg counts and much of this variation is genetic in origin. The sources of variation are dynamic and their relative importance changes over the course of the year. Other sources of variation, apart from inherited effects include maternal and common environmental effects and effects specific to each individual, including variation in intake and non-additive genetic effects. The gender of the lamb, type of birth (single or twin), date of birth and intensity of early exposure to nematode infection have relatively minor but still important effects. The inevitable variation between the observed count and the true faecal egg count also contributes to the observed variation. Both the natural history of infection and the sources of variation among individuals are relatively well understood for T. circumcincta compared to most parasites.  Clinical signs and diagnosis  Essentially all grazing animals are exposed to infection and most animals will carry some nematodes either as adults or arrested early fourth-stage larvae or both. For disease control, the aim is not to diagnose infection but to identify animals or flocks that are sufficiently heavily infected to show reduced production, decreased animal welfare or parasitic gastroenteritis. Heavily infected animals are relatively protein deficient. Clinical signs include reduced appetite, poor growth performance, weight loss and intermittent diarrhoea. In addition to clinical signs, faecal egg counts and the timing of infection are used to identify severely affected animals. However, lambs with very high numbers of worms produce very few eggs; there are strong density-dependent effects of worm number on egg production.  Genetics  The heritability of a trait in the narrow sense is the proportion of inherited variation divided by the total variation. It determines the response to selection. Faecal egg count is widely used to identify and select animals that are relatively resistant to nematode infection. Selection is most advanced in Australia and New Zealand where the dominant nematodes are Haemonchus contortus or a mixture of T. circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. For naturally infected Scottish Blackface lambs grazing fields contaminated with predominantly T. circumcincta eggs, the heritability of faecal egg count was not significantly different from zero for the first two months after birth then rose to approximately 0.3 at the end of the grazing season. Similar heritability estimates were obtained for a flock of Texel sheep. This heritability is similar to the heritability of growth rate in beef cattle and milk production in dairy cattle and indicates the feasibility of selective breeding for resistance to natural predominantly T. circumcincta infection. Genetic variation in faecal egg count in lambs following natural infection is predominantly due to genetic variation influencing worm size and fecundity rather than worm establishment and survival or larval inhibition. Indeed, the heritability of adult female worm size, which is closely related to fecundity, has been estimated at 0.6 whereas the heritability of worm number was only 0.14. The high heritability of worm size is one of the highest heritabilities known for a fitness related trait. There has been a lot of effort devoted to identifying the causal polymorphisms that underlie resistance to infection. Two genomic regions in particular have shown associations in a number of different studies: the DRB1 locus of the major histocompatibility complex and the interferon gamma locus. Linkage disequilibrium in sheep is quite high compared to humans and the causative loci need not be in these regions but are probably in or around these regions. There are a number of regions which have shown suggestive (nearly but not quite statistically significant) associations in more than one study and some of these are probably harbouring causal polymorphisms for nematode resistance. Many of the putative candidate genes influence the immune response and genetic variation seems to predominantly influence immune responsiveness to infection. Although there are clues that other mechanisms may also contribute to genetic variation.  Immune responsiveness  There are two major manifestations of resistance to T. circumcincta: the regulation of worm growth and the control of worm establishment and survival. The regulation of adult worm size and fecundity is strongly and consistently associated with IgA activity especially against fourth-stage larvae. This effect is so strong and consistent that it is likely causal because there is no other immunological mechanism that is so strongly associated with IgA activity. Eosinophil number is also associated with worm length and fecundity and it is likely that eosinophils and IgA interact to influence worm growth and fecundity. Eosinophils have been implicated in resistance to infection to Haemonchus contortus. Eosinophils play a much weaker role in resistance of mice to parasitic infections but this may reflect the fact that mice eosinophils lack the IgA receptor. The other major mechanism of resistance to T. circumcincta is the IgE and mast cell mediated control of worm establishment and survival. Again, this association is so strong and consistent that it is likely to be causal rather than acting as a marker for some other response. IgE activity against third-stage larvae seems to be most important. The number of molecules recognised by IgE seems to be relatively small; two-dimensional Western blotting identified only 9 molecules, although there is evidence for at least two other allergens. For comparison, 155 molecules were recognised by IgA on third-stage larvae.  Pathology  The immune response appears to be responsible for much of the pathology following nematode infection. Immune suppression abolishes many of the clinical signs. Infection causes a relative protein deficiency that leads to reduced weight gain or even weight loss. This due in part to a reduction in appetite. There is also a loss in digestive efficiency. Lesions in the epithelial barrier allow a loss of protein and in addition protein is diverted to tissue repair and immune and inflammatory processes. Protein supplementation of the diet can prevent the appearance of clinical signs which argues strongly that pathogenesis is a consequence of the relative protein deficiency. Following infection, there is a breakdown of the mucosal barrier which is a consequence of mast cell degranulation releasing a serine protease mast cell protease II that digests occludin and claudin in the tight junctions between epithelial cells. Many of the pathological responses such as epithelial hyperplasia, increased pH in the abomasum, pepsinogenaemia and lack of appetite are a consequence of repair processes triggered by the binding of epithelial growth factor in saliva to receptors on the internal surface of epithelial cells. Prolonged and sustained infection subverts the repair process into a pathogenic mechanism. Mixed infections of abomasal and intestinal species are more pathogenic than monospecific infections, at least in cattle. A plausible explanation is that infection in the small intestine inhibits reabsorption of proteins lost in the abomasum.  Mathematical modelling  A number of groups have modelled the infection process ranging from descriptive to semi-mechanistic to almost entirely mechanistic models. Initially models were mainly of academic interest but more and more models are playing a useful role in planning experiments. Models can test the hypotheses arising from natural and deliberate infections; for example whether genomic approaches can be used to identify animals that do not require anthelmintic treatment and suggest potential strategies for the control of infections.  Infection control  The methods to control nematode infection in livestock can be grouped into 6 categories: anthelmintic treatment, grazing management, biological control, nutritional supplementation, vaccination and genetic resistance. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Anthelmintic treatment usually involves treatment with one or more of five classes of broad spectrum drugs. drugs: benzimidazoles, levamisole, macrocyclic lactones, amino acetonitrile derivatives and spiroindoles. Narrow spectrum drugs are also available. Drug formulations vary among countries and only some countries allow combinations of drugs to be used. Anthelmintic treatment is cheap, simple and effective but is threatened by the development of drug resistance in parasite populations. There are a number of strategies to mitigate the development of drug resistance including the use of combinations to delay the development of drug resistance in parasite populations. Drugs have been so cheap and effective that it was usually easier and cheaper to treat all animals in a population. However, not all individuals require treatment and best practice is now to target treatment on selected animals to delay the development of drug resistance. The criteria to decide which animals are to be treated and the size of the untreated population are matters of active research. Grazing management usually aims to increase the supply of grass to grazing livestock but can also reduce the numbers of infective nematode available to infect sheep. The options include adjusting the stocking density, rotational grazing, the use of less infected pastures, alternating the use of pasture between animals and plants, between different species of animals or between young animals and older stock. Grazing management is cheap, simple and at least some elements are widely used but is seldom very effective in isolation and can be impractical. Biological control with spores of the fungus Duddingtonia flagrans has recently been licensed in Australia and can be very effective but requires regular, possibly daily, feeding. Nutritional supplementation can eliminate clinical signs but can be very expensive. Supplementation with protein or non-protein nitrogen sources appear more important than supplementation with energy sources. Non-protein sources such as urea are effective and relatively cheap but great care would be needed to avoid toxicity with high doses. There is currently no completely reliable vaccine but great progress is being made. In general, it is relatively easy to protect older animal but very difficult to protect younger animals. Genetic resistance includes the use of relatively resistant breeds such as the Texel, cross-breeding and selective breeding. Selective breeding can be very effective and almost completely eliminate the need for anthelmintic treatment but requires specialist expertise. Most experts feel that a combination of control methods will be more effective and sustainable. However, the most effective combination of control methods may vary from farm to farm and require specialist expertise to design and implement.

The Patent Office fire of 1877 was the second of several disastrous fires of the U.S. Patent Office. It occurred in the 1864 Patent Office Building of Washington, D.C., on September 24, 1877. The building was constructed to be fireproof, but many of its contents were not. About 80,000 models and 600,000 copy drawings were burned to some degree. No patents were completely lost, however (unlike the situation with the first Patent Office fire), and the Patent Office was soon reopened for recordings. History On 4 July 1836, the Patent Office became it own organization within the Department of State under the Patent Act of 1836. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth became its first commissioner. He started construction of a new fire-proof building, after the previous building had burned down in a disastrous fire. Architect Robert Mills was given instructions by Congress to design the building using fireproof construction material. Mills used masonry vaulted ceilings that spanned the interior spaces for an open floor plan, cement plastered walls, and cantilevered stone staircases from floor level to floor level. Construction of the building was finished in 1864. The Patent Office fire started at about 11 am on September 24, 1877. It was reported in the newspaper that the fire started in the room that held the patent models. There was a considerable amount of flammable material in that area. Spontaneous combustion of patented chemicals has been given as one the theories for the start of the fire. Another theory was that a lens might have caught the sun's rays and focused them on a combustible object. Others claim that it was an unseasonably cold morning, and that a fire started by some copyists in their office grate emitted sparks that fell onto the roof and caught a wooden gutter screen on fire. The roof was constructed of wood, which led to a rapid ignition and a fast-moving disastrous building fire. The fire burned part of the upper portions of the north wing and the west wing, consuming half the building. The Evening Star reported that the spectacle of the building going up in flames became extraordinarily shocking to the spectators as it turned into a calamity. Despite the fire-proof construction efforts the fire consumed the building and devoured some 87,000 patent models with their associated documents. Some of the important artifacts were saved, however, due to the extraordinary efforts of the Patent Office staff and some valiant firemen. Models destroyed This second Patent Office fire was even more destructive than the first fire in 1836 at Blodget's Hotel. According to the person in charge of the models, about 87,000 models were burned to one degree or another and some 600,000 photo-lithographic drawings were damaged by fire and or ruined by water. Although the building may have been considered fire-proof, the contents were not. An early part of the conflagration was a storage room used for rejected and postponed models. There were 37,000 postponed application models and 12,000 rejected cases, making the total damage tally around 136,000 patent models (of one type or another). The monumental building cost almost $3,000,000 in nineteenth-century dollars. Previous to the occurrence of the fire the Patent Office Building had been looked upon as a fireproof structure. A source reported the loss due to the fire as over a half a million dollars in value. The Patent Office could loan out the rejected models to museums and other organizations; however, due to future potential patent infringement they were against such transfers to preserve the integrity of the inventor's idea. These models included metal- working machines, wood-working machines, agricultural implements, carriages, wagons, railroading, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic engineering. An example of the original Eli Whitney cotton gin was among the representative models destroyed. In the south and west wings of the Patent Office there were some 100,000 models that were not damaged. Reports of the time show about two- fifths of all the models were damaged either by fire or water. An estimated 200,000 drawings were hastily carried out of the building before they were damaged. In spite of these great monetary losses (many times those of the first Patent Office fire of 1836), there were no patents totally destroyed in the fire. There were duplicates of the drawings (a lesson learned from the first Patent Office fire in 1836) and it was just a matter of printing them again. Despite the loss of the upper floors and some accumulated trash, the Patent Office was soon reopened.

It is part of a series of movies and television series based on Herriot's novels. It features Iain De Caestecker as the title character following his arrival at veterinary college, alongside Amy Manson and Ben Lloyd-Hughes as fellow students Whirly Tyson and Rob McAloon. Directed by Michael Keillor and written by Ann McManus and Eileen Gallagher, it was a Koco Drama production for the BBC which first aired on BBC One in December 2011. Plot The plot is based on the early life and studies of veterinary surgeon James Herriot, known for his autobiographical books which were the basis for the BBC television series All Creatures Great and Small. The series is set in the 1930s at the Glasgow Veterinary College, where Herriot (Iain De Caestecker) has arrived to train as a veterinary surgeon. It focuses on his relationship with his new-found friends Emma 'Whirly' Tyson (Amy Manson) and Rob McAloon (Ben Lloyd-Hughes). They lodge together at the home of Elspeth Munro (Natasha Little). Also featured are Jenny Muirhead (Joanna Vanderham), who is the only other female student at the college, and lecturers Professor Gunnell (Gary Lewis) and Professor Richie (Tony Curran). Topics which features in the story lines include the subjugation of women, the treatment of students by Professor Gunnell, and the rise of the fascist movement in the UK. Production Announced in July 2010 with the title Young James, the series was devised by Johnny Byrne, a scriptwriter on All Creatures Great and Small, and consultant producer Kate Croft. Byrne, who died in 2008 during the development of the series, knew Alf Wight (who wrote under the pen name Herriot) and his passion and experience convinced Croft that a series could be successful: The series was produced by Koco Drama, a Shed Media company, and written by their executives Ann McManus and Eileen Gallagher. The team had access to the Herriot archive and the archives of the Glasgow Veterinary College, including the diaries and case notes he kept during his student years. It was produced with the cooperation of Wight's family; they met de Caestecker, who found them \\"very helpful\\", and he had dinner with Wight's son Jim.

Christopher Hooton in Metro found that it failed to leave a lasting impression, saying it was \\"an insubstantial, mildly- pleasing period soap\\". He later said that \\"the last thing we needed was a bloated, plodding period drama\\", and he found the lighting \\"more appropriate to a sombre Dickens adaptation than tales of a charming young Scot bumbling his way through veterinary college\\". Jasper Rees for The Arts Desk also discusses the production design, and said: \\"Basically, they've made a children's drama and slotted it after the watershed. The writing goes exceptionally easy on nuance and texture.\\" It reminded Michael Hogan, writing in The Daily Telegraph, \\"of French and Saunders's cruelly accurate costume parody, The House of Idiot, where characters crowbarred in clumsy nods to 'the period' just to remind forgetful viewers\\". Despite the \\"odd amusing moment\\", he felt it \\"rather let down the well-loved original\\". At the 2012 British Academy Scotland Awards, Iain de Caestecker and Michael Keillor were nominated for the television actor and director awards respectively. In April 2012 the BBC confirmed the series would not return. DVD release The first series was released in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2012. In the U.S. and Canada on 4 September 2012.

She made her first appearance on 5 March 2001 investigating the shooting of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), which was part of the whodunit storyline \\"Who Shot Phil?\\". Marsden returned in 2002, 2003 and 2009 (for another whodunit storyline, \\"Who Killed Archie?\\"). She returned on 5 January 2012 for her third whodunit storyline, \\"Who's Stalking Phil?\\", departing four months later on 10 May 2012. Marsden returned for two episodes on 17 August 2012 to conclude the latter storyline. On 16 July 2015, she returned for part of the \\"Who Killed Lucy Beale?\\" whodunit storyline. When she was brought back in 2009, Marsden's feelings were explored in a segment of the BBC EastEnders homepage entitled \\"Marsden's Video Diaries\\", documenting the character's thoughts about the storyline in which she was involved. Marsden's relationship with Phil has been explored since her first appearance, with the BBC describing their relationship as a \\"romance in negative...her ultimate dream is that some day she'll get [Phil] behind bars\\" and the Daily Mirror Tony Stewart calling her Phil's \\"arch enemy\\". The character has been criticised by police detectives who felt that Marsden's habit of discussing investigation details with suspects (as her colleagues accepted bribes) did not properly represent their profession. In response, the BBC said it had sought advice from a police consultant for storylines involving Marsden. Storylines 2001‚Äì2003 Jill Marsden first appears on Albert Square in March 2001, having been assigned as the chief police detective in charge of investigating the shooting of local hardman Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). She identifies the five main suspects: Phil's stepson Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), ex-business partner Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), sworn enemy Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), love rival Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and former girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). After Marsden interrogates each of the suspects behind Phil's shooting, it is eventually transpired in April 2001 that Lisa was the culprit. However, Phil gradually forgives Lisa and decides to frame Dan for the crime instead. He plants the gun, which Lisa took from Steve's office, in Dan's possession and enables for Marsden and her colleagues to arrest Dan for shooting Phil. A couple of months later, however, Dan is acquitted due to lack of evidence. Marsden later arrests local housewife Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) for the attempted murder of her husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). Little Mo claims self-defence, since she has been a victim of domestic violence at the hands of Trevor. The trial ends, with Trevor's treatment of Little Mo revealed. In 2003, local resident Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) visits Marsden with evidence that Phil killed his ex-girlfriend Lisa. Marsden sets up a honey-trap for Phil in order to obtain a confession from him, with PC Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and DI Dominic Price (Paul Brennen) aiding her in the case; however, this fails when Kate falls in love with Phil and Marsden fires her. Marsden arrests Phil, but with insufficient evidence and no confession he is released. It later emerges that Lisa is safe and well, and Phil is innocent. This forces Marsden to let Phil off the hook, but she later arrests him for armed robbery; Phil's arch-rivals Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and his illegitimate son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) have worked together to set him up for the crime in revenge for what he did to their beloved family member, Sharon (Letitia Dean). 2009‚Äì2010 Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Phil's villainous uncle, Archie (Larry Lamb), is murdered on Christmas Day 2009. She arrives on the scene when several people claim that Archie's partner-in-crime, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), had killed him - though but Marsden waits before questioning her, and decides to interrogate the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his new girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found at the scene of the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. When Marsden notices Shirley's best-friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison) is at a vulnerable state over the matter, she questions Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off, Marsden arrests Phil's sister Sam (Danniella Westbrook) for the murder; Sam has accused her and Phil's mother, Peggy (Barbara Windsor), for killing Archie. Later on, Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy; she had been questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing. On 18 January, Marsden arrests Ian after Janine told her that Ian took advantage of her, stole Archie's laptop, which had a recording of them having sex on it, and dumped it in the canal. Ian refuses to talk, but when Marsden shows him CCTV footage of him dumping the laptop, and then shows him the recovered laptop, he admits visiting Archie on Christmas Day; claiming that Archie was threatening him and that he merely visited him to delete the recording. Ian denies murdering Archie, but Marsden is unconvinced and later charges him. A couple of days later, Janine tells Marsden she saw Ian leave the Queen Victoria on Christmas Day but the bust of Queen Victoria was on the bar after he left. Marsden places Janine at the scene, but she also denies murdering Archie. Marsden tells Ian that although the murder charge will be dropped, he will still be charged with burglary and theft of Archie's laptop. She and DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) attend Archie's funeral, watching people's reactions in the hope of a new lead. Peggy returns to Archie's grave; when Marsden asks why, she explains that she didn't believe him when he said his cancer had returned. The following week, Archie's daughter Ronnie (Samantha Womack) spots Marsden talking to her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) about Archie's murder; Jack tells Ronnie that he was fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the caf√©, Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained - ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whispers-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, prompting her to arrest Ronnie - who is later charged with assaulting a police officer; Ronnie is subsequently released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, Marsden witnesses fellow policewoman DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) entering the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. Marsden is suspicious when Jasmine arrests Jack's stepmother, Dot (June Brown), for assaulting her granddaughter Dotty (Molly Conlin).; earlier on, Dot slapped Dotty after she insulted her and wish that she had died at the hands of her father and Dot's criminal son - Nick (John Altman). Shortly after Dot is taken into custody, though later released without charge, Jack accuses Marsden for unnecessarily sending am uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettle the locals; he later realizes there was no new information. Janine tells Marsden that Ronnie has fled, but Marsden finds her at the Queen Vic. Marsden remarks that a new forensic profile has been found, and DNA screening of white males will shortly begin. After Hughes accepts a bribe from Jack to make the DNA samples disappear, Marsden receives an anonymous tip-off. The police search Janine's flat, finding the engagement ring that went missing the night of Archie's murder, and Janine is arrested; she is later released for lack of evidence. The police are again called with a warrant to arrest Jack's nephew Bradley (Charlie Clements), after his ex-lover Becca Swanson (Simone James) told Marsden that Bradley had attacked Archie on Christmas Day. Marsden spots him when his phone rings; two officers chase Bradley to the roof, where he stumbles and falls to his death. The investigation ends, since the police believe that Bradley had killed Archie; however, his killer was actually Bradley's estranged wife Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) - who later confesses the murder to her father-in-law Max (Jake Wood). 2012 In January 2012, Ian's one-time lover Denise Fox (Diane Parish) gives Marsden a letter that incriminates Phil in the death of a homeless man - who is reported to have died after Phil torched the car lot in an insurance scam in 1994; she adds that Phil also murdered his ex-fiance, Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), and Marsden thanks Denise for the information. Marsden arrives in Walford and begins trailing Phil. She asks Denise not to tell Phil that she is in town, wanting to ensure Phil's imprisonment. Marsden then targets Phil's son, Ben (Joshua Pascoe), interviewing him about Stella's death. Ben was abused by Stella and finds Marsden's questions distressing; however, she continues to press him. After a falling-out with Phil Ben changes his statement, telling Marsden that Phil told Stella to jump off a building or he would push her. Marsden then arrests Phil for murder, and Ben reveals he was stalking him. She informs Phil's partner, Shirley, that he has been charged with Stella's murder. Ben pleads with Marsden to keep his statement a secret from the Mitchells, but she tells him he must accept that his father will learn about Ben's involvement in his arrest eventually. After discovering Ben's lies about his father, Ian then passes this information on to Marsden and Ben is arrested. On the day Phil release, he helps Ben hide his involvement in Heather's murder; Marsden tells Phil at the police station she will contact him about Ben's accusations. The charges against Ben are dropped; Marsden visits Phil, taunting him that he will eventually slip up and further implies that Ben may ultimately bring him to justice In August, Marsden reappears when Ben confesses Heather's murder. She does not believe his confession, thinking it is another lie to get attention from Phil. However, Ben is arrested and charged with the murder after Marsden helps fellow policeman DS Luke Crisp (Rufus Wright) convince Ben's best-friend, Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), to implicate him as Heather's killer. 2015 In July 2015, Phil learns that Marsden is aiding her colleague DI Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman) with investigating the murder of Ian's daughter Lucy (Hetti Bywater); her father and the Beale family were earlier informed that Marsden would be coordinating with the case. When Phil answers the door that Marsden is knocking outside his house, he is shocked and appalled when she wants to speak to Ben about Lucy's murder. Phil slams the door in her face and then attempts to delay Marsden so Ben can flee Walford, but Ben is eventually arrested. Development Characterisation Nicknamed the \\"female sleuth\\" by the Daily Record, Marsden's profile on the EastEnders website describes her as \\"fearless, [a] no-nonsense copper and the scourge of Walford‚Äôs criminal fraternity.\\" The East Anglian Daily Times described Marsden as \\"tough\\", Ian Hyland from The Mirror called her \\"scary\\" and Nancy Banks-Smith from The Guardian characterised her as \\"strict\\". Naomi Mcelroy described Marsden as a \\"curly-haired copper\\", but said as a detective she was \\"rubbish\\"; Polly Hudson from The Daily Mirror similarly opined, saying she was \\"useless\\" (as did Mcelroy), and stated that Marsden was \\"making a right pig's ear\\" of investigating Archie's (Lamb) murder. The Daily Mirror Tony Stewart characterised her as \\"vindictive\\". Introduction, 2002 and 2003 returns Marsden first appeared on 5 March 2001 in the \\"Who Shot Phil?\\" storyline. In the whodunit storyline the five main suspects were Dan Sullivan, Steve Owen, Lisa Shaw, Ian Beale and Mark Fowler. A source in the Daily Record said, \\"Sooner or later the truth will out. But until then there's going to be a lot of probing going on.\\" She left on 27 March 2001 after unsuccessfully identifying the shooter (who turned out to be Lisa). In 2002 she appeared in January, April and from 14 November to 6 December. In November, when Marsden returns, the police suspect that Phil has murdered his ex-wife Lisa. The Daily Mirror said, \\"They are the words Phil Mitchell has heard many times before. 'You're nicked', baldy. Intrepid DCI Marsden may not be a Jane Tennison, but she's nabbed her prime suspect. \\"I've got some good news for you, Phil,\\" she says, after arresting him on suspicion of murder. \\"The police in Portugal found your jacket. Unfortunately for you, it's covered in blood. Mrs Fowler's blood...\\" In 2003, Marsden returned in March July, August, November and for a longer stint in December. Who Killed Archie? and 2012 returns Stacey (Lacey Turner, pictured).alt=Smiling young woman with short dark hair In November 2009, it was reported that Stanton would reprise her role as Jill. Digital Spy forum members had previously pointed out that her return was hinted at in a photo on the official EastEnders website and in a feature (\\"Script Peek\\") where Phil is quoted as saying, \\"I know exactly what makes her tick\\" before adding \\"I've wriggled off her hook so many times. She's already picturing me standing in the dock\\" in the 29 December episode. Marsden returned to investigate the murder of Archie Mitchell. A source told Digital Spy, \\"Marsden has a score to settle with Phil. She was never far behind Phil when he put a foot out of place all those years ago and she's back with a vengeance...With so many people in the frame for Archie's murder, Marsden has a difficult job on her hands if she wants to pin it on Phil.\\" Of her return she said, \\"It came completely out of the blue, and knocked me for six.\\"...I really thought Marsden was no more. It was a really great surprise because I‚Äôd just finished a year‚Äôs run at the National Theatre, appearing in a new play called England People Very Nice ‚Äì so it couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time.\\" She returned on 28 December 2009. Although Stanton did not know who murdered Archie, she guessed that it could be Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie was one of the few to correctly guess it was Stacey. \\"I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn‚Äôt going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we‚Äôd shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who could get away with it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!\\" Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fianc√©e Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: \\"The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemesis, DCI Marsden ‚Äì and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars\\". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, \\"suspecting that all is not what it seems\\". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012. Who Killed Lucy Beale? In July 2015, it was revealed that Stanton would be reprising her role as Marsden for the continuation of the Who Killed Lucy Beale? storyline. Whilst viewers know Bobby Beale is the culprit, Marsden, Samantha Keeble and Cameron Bryant will reportedly make an arrest for the murder, arresting an innocent suspect. Related media The BBC used viral promotion on the EastEnders homepage to further develop the storyline of Who Killed Archie?, with Marsden the main character in the nine videos. A new section (\\"Marsden's Video Diaries\\") was launched, encompassing events on the show from 25 December 2009 onwards in diary style from Marsden's point of view.These episodes were:   * Insight was provided on the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: \\"Christmas Day. I should be at home with my feet up eating a mince pie and watching the Doctor Who Christmas special. Instead, I‚Äôve been called into work. Murder. A bloody one too. The victim, one Archibald Mitchell. Not the first time a Mitchell's ruined my night. Still, if this leads to Phil Mitchell all wrapped up in Walford nick by New Years day, might be the best present I‚Äôve ever had.\\" On the videos Marsden discussed evidence, suspects she had brought in and her relationship with Phil. During the next three video diaries, Marsden talks about the suspects and the evidence against them. In episode three it is Ronnie, Peggy and Sam; in episode four she talks about Janine Butcher, and in episode five she discusses Ian's motives. Towards the end of the series (in episode seven), Marsden's boss threatens to fire her if she does not capture the culprit: \\"I‚Äôve got to get someone. I‚Äôve got to pin this on someone. Every address in the immediate area door-stopped. Five suspects questioned, one arrest. Nothing. They tell me nothing. Mitchell, the ex wife, the daughter, Beale, Butcher, [Jack] Branning, I‚Äôm getting closer, I just need time. Of course my boss is putting pressure on. Says I‚Äôm losing my touch, That he'll take the case of me. This is my case. Somebody's going down for it and it ain‚Äôt going to be me.\\" In the penultimate episode, Marsden announces that the DNA results have come through; this is aired on EastEnders. The final episode of Marsden's Video Diaries aired on 19 February 2010, three days before Marsden's departure in 2010. In this episode (\\"Case Closed\\"), the Lionel Richie song \\"Hello\\" plays as the \\"Who Killed Archie?\\" storyline replays with the focus on Marsden. The BBC described the episode: \\"DCI Marsden's caught Archie's killer ‚Äì or she's collared someone for it at least. But Hello!? Was it Phil she was looking for? Don't tell us you didn't spot the latent chemistry between this pair. Shirley must have been livid. We wouldn't like to surmise what the DCI planned to do with Phil if she got him behind bars. But we do hope this is one Endless Love that will be revisited...\\" Marsden's Video Diaries episodes Reception When Marsden returned in December 2002, Ian Hyland of The Mirror said he disliked the \\"smouldering\\" sexual tension between Phil and Marsden. Jo Atkison of the Western Mail discussed the Marsden-Kate-Phil storyline, saying, \\"Betrayal with a capital B is the order of the day in the Square this week. It's the cop Kate plot I'm interested in. To shop or not to shop is a dilemma that Kate finds hard to cope with as she waits for the confession that will nail Phil for good\\". In an interview with the East Anglian Daily Times, Stanton remarked that she was frequently asked to have her photo taken due to her role in EastEnders. Real-life police detectives criticised the portrayals of detectives Marsden and her colleague DC Wayne Hughes in the show, saying that viewers who see them talking to residents about the case and accepting bribes may believe that the police operate that way in reality. The BBC insisted that a police consultant was used, adding that \\"this is heightened fiction and all the things that we show might not always represent real life.\\" A spokesperson said, \\"We always have a police consultant on shows like this that we go to before casting.\\" Jane Simon and Brian Mclver described Marsden as having an \\"appetite for making random arrests\\". Simon added, \\"While the list of suspects includes the entire northern hemisphere, it's time for DCI Marsden to make another of her daily arrests. Like a Formula One pit stop, she has got it down to a fine art.\\" Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror commented on the \\"Who Killed Archie?\\" storyline: \\"Despite widespread apathy, Albert Square's Cockney rabble trundle on with the life-sapping saga of Who Killed Archie? Who gives a toss? While potential murderers Phil, Ian, Bradley (Charlie Clements) and the gang hint furtively at their guilt, the absurd DCI Marple ‚Äì sorry Marsden ‚Äì keeps arresting bunny-boiler Ronnie without a shred of evidence. \\"I've spent 20 years building a career on hunches,\\" bragged Miss Marsden. Yeah, and you've made it all the way to Walford nick. A real high flyer!\\" In 2015, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap bemoaned Marsden's return, saying \\"Can someone please explain to us why DCI Marsden is now in charge of the Lucy Beale case? She couldn't catch a bus, let along a killer.\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (2001) References External links Marsden's Video Diaries at BBC Online EastEnders characters Fictional British police detectives Television characters introduced in 2001 Female characters in television ","title":"Jill Marsden (EastEnders)"},{"id":"34136084","text":"Coat of arms of the town and municipality of Hoorn The coat of arms of Hoorn is a coat of arms that has been in use since the middle ages. Although over time it underwent some changes, there has been no change to the coat of arms since it was acknowledged in use by the High Council of Nobility in 1816. At present, in the original form, it is the coat of arms of the municipality of Hoorn. The current municipality was formed in 1979 by merging the city of Hoorn with the villages Zwaag and Westerblokker; it was decided to use the old coat of arms as coat of arms of the new municipality. Gemeentegids 2012, Cijfers en wetenswaardigheden over Hoorn, pag. 20, Wapen van Hoorn  Origin  The actual coat of arms, the shield, shows a horn held by a blue ribbon. According to a myth this is a horn of a bull, which fled from Monnickendam and lost its horn while pounding the city gate of Hoorn. Upon seeing the horn the sheriff decided that the horn would become part of the coat of arms of the city, as the city didn‚Äôt have a coat of arms yet. Heraldry Monnickendam  Development  The horn has always been part of the coat of arms, but during times there have been several supporters, during the 15th century both Mary, with baby Jesus, and John the Baptist (patron saint of the city), have been supporters of several official coats of arms. More normal pieces had Mary seated on a Gothic throne on top of the coat of arms. The seal of secrets of the city showed John the Baptist with the coat of arms at his feet Heraldry Hoorn In 1538 the coat of arms of the city was shown for the first time with two unicorns instead of Mary. This was the actual coat of arms of the bishop Jan van Egmond, bishop of the Archdiocese of Utrecht. Following the Reformation Mary was also replaced in the city seals by a unicorn, this time a single unicorn. Because of the Christian symbolism this was seen as an appropriate substitute. During the French domination the coat of arms was changed to the French standard. An eagle replaced the unicorn. As soon as the Batavian Republic was there the coat of arms from before French rule was reinstalled; this time it was also requested at the High Council of Nobility (Dutch: Hoge Raad van Adel), so it became official. The coat of arms was acknowledged at June 26, 1816  Blazon  Coat of arms on a vehicle of the municipality of Hoorn The description or the blazon of the coat of arms of Hoorn is as follows: In English: \\"Of silver, charged with a horn gules (red), ringed with gold, banded with azure (blue), with gold tassels, the shield held from behind by a sitting Unicorn gules (red), horned, maned, bearded, and flaked tailed of gold.\\" This blazon makes this coat of arms an example of canting arms.  Other usage  Banishing pole at Schardam. The unicorn with shield and horn are not only to be seen in the city and municipality of Hoorn. In the region West-Friesland are several banishing poles (a pole telling a banned person not to pass it, or this person will enter the judicial area and can be judged) with this unicorn on top of it. The horn points towards the city of Hoorn. One of these poles still stands in the village of Schardam, this pole dates from 1761. In 2007 big unicorns were painted by several artists to celebrate 650 years of town privileges. These unicorns later went on to auction.

He was Governor of Grenada from 1779 to 1783. Born at Chateau Vauchaussades, Combrailles, in the Auvergne, Durat's family had a history of military service. In 1751 he entered the French Army, serving in the Seven Years' War. He distinguished himself in the Siege of Fort St Philip, and was assigned to coastal defences until 1759, when he joined a planned expedition against Ireland that failed due to British blockades of the French ports. He was sent to the West Indies in 1763, serving as artillery chief at Martinique. In 1774 he was awarded the Order of Saint Louis for his service. By 1778 he had risen to lieutenant colonel of the Regiment de Cambr√©sis. The following year he was part of comte d'Estaing's expedition to capture Grenada, leading an advance unit that participated in the storming of Hospital Hill. D'Estaing rewarded Durat by appointing him governor of the island, a post he held until the British retook control under terms of the 1783 Treaty of Paris. Durat's governance was reported by the British residents to be harsh, and there was a backlash against the French residents afterward. These divisions contributed to the near-success of the F√©don Rebellion in 1795-96. After his return to France, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1784, and field marshal in 1788. He died at his home, Chateau Vauchaussade, on 20 January 1830. He was twice married. By his second wife he had a son S√©bastien Henri de Durat (1788-1806) who followed him into military service, joined the 34th Line Infantry Regiment and died of wounds sustained at Jena.

Family Symes (pronounced ) was born in Glen Osborne, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Frank H. and Clara (Heckert) Symes and graduated from high school in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. His later rise to prominence with the Pennsylvania earned him honorary college degrees from Waynesburg, Duquesne, Ursinus, Trinity, Marietta and Ohio. On September 27, 1919, he married Fern Elizabeth Dick; they had one daughter, Jeanne Doris. On the Standard Railroad of the World Symes joined the Pennsylvania Railroad as a clerk in 1916. One of the earliest‚Äîand largest railroads in the United States‚Äîthe Pennsylvania began styling itself the \\"Standard Railroad of the World\\" the same year James Symes went to work for the company. One of the largest railroads, it was also one of the largest business concerns in the U.S. It bought and carried miles of steel rails, bought and carried millions of tons of anthracite coal, carried more tonnage and earned more income than almost any other road in the nation. Symes was rapidly promoted through the World War One era and the era of nationalization under the U.S. Railroad Administration from car tracer, car distributor, and statistician, moving from Pennsylvania to the general superintendent's office in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1923 he was appointed freight movement director for the Pennsy's Central Region, with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He then apprenticed to the road's general manager in Chicago, Illinois, from 1927 to 1928. Following this posting he was appointed superintendent for passenger transportation on the western half of the Pennsy system, again headquartered in Chicago. In 1934 he went to the road's headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as chief of freight transportation. In 1935, he was lent out to the Association of American Railroads for a four-year period, serving as vice-president, operations and maintenance, for the industrial association of American's largest systems. He worked out of the AAR's headquarters in Washington, D.C. He returned to the Pennsy in 1939 as general manager for the Western Region at Chicago. In the 1940s and early 1950s Symes was promoted into the top operational positions on the Pennsylvania. These were vice-president at Chicago (1942‚Äì46), deputy vice-president for operations at Philadelphia (1946‚Äì47), vice president, operations (1947‚Äì52), executive vice-president (1952‚Äì54), and in June 1954, president. Death of the Pennsy and the birth of Penn Central On November 1, 1959, Symes was named chairman of the board of directors with Allen J. Greenough, former vice-president in charge of transportation and maintenance, succeeding Symes as president. Behind the scenes, Ball noted, \\"The one-time unimagineable, unthinkable scenario of Pennsy and New York Central discussing survival by merging the two properties had begun.\\" Retired Penn Central executive Peter E. Lynch noted in his history of the Penn Central that \\"A severe economic recession in 1957-8 caused both the Pennsy and the New York Central to lose seventeen percent of their revenue. Symes believed Pennsy and Central to be complementary and approached the Central's Robert R. Young in late 1957 about consolidation . . . . the two roads continued to talk after Young's death until early in 1959, when talks broke off because of Central's Alfred E. Perlman's belief that merger with the Baltimore and Ohio would better balance the Pennsylvania and its Norfolk and Western-Nickel Plate Road-Wabash Railroad affiliate.\\" This planning fell apart in 1960 when the Baltimore and Ohio instead decided on consolidation with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and the Western Maryland Railway, forerunners of CSX Transportation. Symes was not deterred, stating to the Interstate Commerce Commission during its Chessie system hearings in 1960 \\"that he did not oppose the Baltimore and Ohio/Chesapeake and Ohio merger and remained open to merging with the Central.\\" In fact, Joseph Daughen and Peter Binzen write that Symes was a surprise witness at the hearings, asked by the Chessie's management to show up and support their merger. Symes went out of his way to say that if the New York Central knocked on the Pennsy's door, \\"that door would not be closed\\". Financial pressures brought Perlman on October 25, 1961 to Symes and they agreed to take up where they had left off twenty-one months before. Agreement on key issues was quickly reached. The Central would sell its twenty percent interest in the Baltimore and Ohio. The Pennsy would divest itself, over time, of its one-third interest in the Norfolk and Western. (Penn Central's financial officer, David C. Bevan, would use the $300 million realized from this sale on non-rail diversification.) The Central would thus go out of business as a corporate entity, while the corporate existence of the Pennsylvania would continue under a new name. By 1962 the Pennsy and Central boards approved a Penn Central merger where one share of Pennsy stock would be exchanged for one share of the new company's stock, and 1.3 shares of Central stock would be exchanged for one share of the new Penn Central stock. Board representation would be based on shares outstanding in 1961‚Äîabout 6.5 million for the Central, about 13.2 for the Pennsy‚Äîthe outstanding shares, resulted in a sixty-forty split on the new board in favor of the Pennsy shareholders. By the end of the year the roads applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for permission to merge. ICC hearings and adverse reaction from the Department of Justice meant permission to merge would not be granted for an additional two years. Symes, first to testify before the ICC, touted the size of the system resulting from the merger‚Äîlargest in terms of miles of track‚Äîlargest in terms of gross revenue. Penn Central would be the tenth largest corporation in the nation, with assets of $5 billion and nearly 185,000 employees. H. Roger Grant notes that \\"Symes boasted that the combination could generate savings of $100 million annually and perhaps even more.\\" What was not as large were net earnings and return on investment. The Penn Central would be far down the list of U.S. railroads in terms of profitability. In spite of this, Symes declared the merger would \\"preserve and strengthen these railroads in the public interest and for the national defense, to arrest their physical deterioration of the last fifteen years, and to avert possible bankruptcy that could eventually lead to nationalization.\\" Nearly as difficult for the proposed Penn Central managers was the request to the ICC by the trustees of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, bankrupted in 1961, for inclusion into the new Penn Central. The New Haven primarily a Boston to New York line, heavily engaged in money-losing long-haul and local passenger operations. Under questioning, both Symes and Perlman rejected the notion of including the New Haven into the Penn Central. Both preferred the New Haven to be merged into a New England system which would include the Boston and Maine, along with the Central's own subsidiary, the Boston and Albany. Perlman's comments on this proposed New England system were dubious at best, as he also testified to the ICC that the Boston and Albany was a \\"marginal operation that regularly lost money.\\" The Boston and Maine was struggling under its own debt load and itself went bankrupt in 1970. Neither Symes nor Perlman offered an explanation of how one marginally successful road could be integrated into a bankrupt road and a soon to be bankrupt road and be made to perform. What was clear was that both men, with decades in the railroad industry, viewed the New Haven as outright poison. Symes testified that if inclusion of the New Haven were made a condition of the merger he would recommend to his board that the merger not \\"go forward.\\" Perlman was even more adamant, stating that \\"should this railroad, with all its inefficiencies and its liabilities today be taken over by systems that are still solvent, without first being made to help itself . . . it would be a grave mistake and a burden on interstate commerce and not in the public interest.\\" On October 1, 1963, one day before ICC hearings on the Penn Central merger ended, Symes stepped down as chairman of the Pennsy board (he would remain as chairman of the board's Executive Committee through 1968). In letter full of praise to C. Jared Ingersoll, chairman of board committee searching for Symes' replacement, Symes recommended Stuart T. Saunders; the board unanimously elected Saunders as Chairman/CEO effective October 1, 1963. As the merger approached, Symes and Saunders found themselves embroiled in political battle for the governorship of the state of Pennsylvania, where Democratic candidate Milton J. Shapp ran on a platform which included dire predictions against the proposed merger. One of Shapp's key charges was that the new company would re-route freight traffic out of Pennsylvania and onto former Central routes through New York state. Concessions by Penn Central management to employees (inclusion of the bankrupt New Haven, reinstatement of laid-off workers, job protection agreements) finally overcame objections from the Johnson administration's Department of Justice, which ended its opposition in November, 1967. The Penn Central merger finally went into effect on February 1, 1968, at which time Penn Central was the 10th largest business in the U.S., with more than 100,000 employees, 20,000 route miles of track, and operations over fourteen states and two Canadian provinces. At the end of 1961, the two roads had 120,416 employees, 247,766 freight cars, 7,009 passenger cars and 4,805 locomotives. On the last day of 1968 the Penn Central totals stood at 94,453 employees, 187,362 freight cars, 4,976 passenger cars and 4,404 units; 21% fewer employees; 24% fewer freight cars, 29% fewer passenger cars. The birth of Conrail and the death of Symes The merger proved to be one of the largest debacles in corporate history. On January 1, 1969, as part of the Interstate Commerce Commission's conditions to approve the merger, the New Haven was absorbed as well. Within just two years the Penn Central became the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history to that time. Adversarial management teams, poorly planned attempts to diversify away from railroading, failure to adopt a standardized computer system, years of deferred maintenance, federal regulation and federally subsidized competition (the interstate highway system, the St. Lawrence seaway), coupled with deindustrialization in the heart of the Penn Central's territory quickly overwhelmed the company. Failure to integrate the computer system alone meant the company lost waybills, lost freight cars, clogged rail yards, and freight customers, who had the option of switching to sea or truck, took their business elsewhere. The role of the New Haven remains disputed. Symes stated to Daughen and Binzen that the inclusion of the New Haven was a major factor in the collapse of Penn Central. Symes' hand-picked successor, Stuart T. Saunders, disagreed. In 1970, after two years of losses and major under- performance in freight and passenger rail operations, Penn Central announced in February 1970 that 1969 rail operations generated a loss of $56 million versus $5.1 million for the year before. Ominously, income dropped from $88 million to $4.38 million between 1968 and 1969. As a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation later noted, these reports \\"[ended] confidence in its commercial paper in the financial community.\\" From spring through summer, Penn Central's financial position with the financial community declined precipitously, the first quarter losses being reported as $100 million, compared to $220 for the entire twelve months of 1969. The company was $2.6 billion in debt. Large investors and financial institutions sold the company's stock. Chase Manhattan Bank's own analysts' negative forecasts for Penn Central led the company to sell more than 134,000 shares on May 22, 1970. Four days later Chase's Investment Department officially changed its recommendation to \\"sell\\". Penn Central was rapidly using up its lines of credit and unable to secure additional funding for operations through private institutions. Saunders approached the federal government for financing via the United States Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe, noting the company had reached its borrowing capacity. Perhaps Penn Central could be financed federally under the Defense Production Act. When the United States Department of Defense announced it could subsidize Penn Central to the amount of $200 million, the parties were blocked by Congressman Wright Patman, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, and the Senate Commerce Committee. This story broke in The Wall Street Journal on June 12, 1970. The same day Saunders and Perlman submitted their resignations to the Penn Central board. Attempts by the Nixon administration and Penn Central officials on June 20 failed to change Patman's views; no federal funding would be forthcoming. The following day, after a special board meeting, the Penn Central Transportation Company filed for Chapter 77 bankruptcy protection. The company Jim Symes worked for more than ten years to create lost over a half-million dollars a day by 1970, but the Board of Directors continued paying cash dividends; some subsidiaries would not stop paying dividends until a month after the parent company declared bankruptcy. Penn Central struggled on for over five more years as managers and politicians sought solutions to the railroad problems of the Northeast. The political solution turned out to be Conrail. Railway Age reported that in January 1976, Penn Central had 8,478 route miles under slow orders. In February Railway Age reported Penn Central suffered 1783 derailments in the first two months of the year, an increase of 878 percent for the same period in 1975.

It runs for 25 miles between the Pickering Junction on the eastern edge of Toronto, and the MacMillan Yard in Vaughan. Prior to the construction of the York Sub, CN traffic ran through the downtown core along the CN Kingston Subdivision and through the Union Station area. During the 1950s, CN developed a plan to move traffic off of this line to a major new switching yard (MacMillan Yard) in what was then farmland north of the city. Traffic normally passing through downtown was switched onto the two new subdivisions, the Halton Sub connecting to the west, and the York Sub to the east. Construction of the York Sub took place between 1959 and 1965.\\"CN York Subdivision\\", Rails in Toronto Originally built in what was then farmland, the York Sub is now mostly urbanized in the Greater Toronto Area and has little room for expansion. The line spurs off northwest from the Kingston Sub at Pickering Junction in Pickering, with a bridge crossing over Highway 401. The line briefly enters Toronto (passing through Rouge National Urban Park) and enters York Region, where it runs between Steeles Avenue and Highway 7 to west of Keele Street, where it continues west as the Halwest Subdivision at the wye tracks leading into the MacMillan Yard. It connects with the Newmarket Sub at Snider, with the Bala Sub at Doncaster, and with the Uxbridge Sub at Hagerman. Originally, there were diamonds with connecting wyes at each of these locations, but since the crossing with the Uxbridge Subdivision was grade separated, the connecting tracks at Hagerman were removed. The opening of the York Sub led to dramatically less traffic on the portion of the Kingston Sub between Pickering Junction and Union Station in downtown Toronto, with a notable exception being autorack trains travelling to and from the Ford assembly plant in Oakville. This allowed GO Transit to offer passenger trains along this route starting in 1967, on what is today known as the Lakeshore East line. Metrolinx has since purchased this section of the Kingston Sub, which has removed almost all of CN's traffic from the downtown routes. Metrolinx also purchased a portion of the Newmarket Sub from Bradford to Barrie to operate their Barrie line. The Newmarket Sub, south of Bradford, and north of Rama, is still owned by CN. The significant amount of traffic on the York Sub led to delays on the Barrie line, backing up at the Snyder diamond. This led to the creation of a new grade-separated bridge to bypass the junction, allowing GO traffic to operate unhindered. Similarly, a grade- separated bridge was built at Hagerman, where the Uxbridge subdivision crosses the York subdivision. This bridge opened for service in December 2008.

In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \\"five-for\\" or \\"fifer\\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a significant achievement. , 156 cricketers have taken a five-wicket haul on their debut in a Test match, with nine of them being taken by West Indian players. They have taken a five-wicket haul on debut against five different opponents: four times against England, twice against India, and once against Australia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka each. Of the nine occasions, the West Indies won the match four times, and drew once. The players have taken five-wicket hauls at three different venues, two in the West Indies and one overseas. The most common venue for a West Indies player to achieve the feat is Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, where it has occurred five times. All three hauls which occurred overseas took place at Old Trafford in Manchester, England. Hines Johnson was the first West Indian player to take a five-wicket haul on his Test debut, taking five wickets for 41 runs against England in 1948. Alf Valentine, Darren Sammy and Franklyn Rose took eight, seven and six wickets respectively, while six others have taken five wickets on their debut. Valentine took eight wickets for 104 runs, the best bowling figures by a West Indian bowler on debut, against England in 1950, at Old Trafford, Manchester. He accumulated 11 wickets for 204 runs in the match. Johnson and Valentine are the only West Indians to have taken ten wickets in a match on debut; Johnson is one of only nine bowlers to take two five-wicket hauls on debut. Amongst the bowlers, Johnson is the most economical, with 1.17 runs per over, and Sammy has the best strike rate. , the most recent bowler to achieve the feat was Sammy, taking seven wickets for 66 runs in his debut Test, against England in 2007.

Hunter- Blair incorrectly describes the Arte as a grammar of the language spoken in Canara, a district on the Malabar coast; see \\"Thomas Stephen Buston\\". Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. 1913. The Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) has two articles on Thomas Stephens, the one cited and another under \\"Thomas Stephens\\". was composed by the 16th-century English Jesuit priest Father Thomas Stephens, thus making Konkani the first among the modern Indian languages to have its grammar codified and described.Mariano Saldanha, \\"Hist√≥ria de Gram√°tica Concani,\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies 8 (1935-37) 715. See also M. Saradesaya, A History of Konkani Literature: From 1500 to 1992 (New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, 2000) 42-43. The system was expanded upon by Diogo Ribeiro and four other Jesuits and printed in Rachol (located in the Indian state of Goa) in the year 1640. A second edition was then developed and introduced in 1857 by J.H. da Cunha Rivara, who possessed a great passion for Konkani. Consequently, three versions of the Arte exist: #Arte da lingoa Canari. MS held by the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. #Arte da lingoa Canarim, composed by Padre Thomaz Estev√£o and Padre Diogo Ribeiro of the Company of Jesus & amended by other Padres of the same company. 1640. Grammatica da Lingua Concani, composed by Padre Thomaz Estev√£o of the Company of Jesus and edited by J.H. da Cunha Rivara. Nova Goa: Imprensa Nacional. 1857. Canarim Konkani has been known by a variety of names: canarim, concanim, gomantaki, bramana and goani. It is called amchi bhas (\\"our language\\") by native speakers and govi, or Goenchi bhas, by others. Learned Marathi speakers tend to call it gomantaki.M. Saldanha 717. J. Thekkedath, however, quotes Jose Pereira to the following effect: A lay brother of the College of St Paul around 1563 composed the first grammar of Konkani. His work was continued by Fr Henry Henriques and later by Fr Thomas Stephens. The grammar of Fr Stephens was ready in manuscript form before the year 1619. (Jose Pereira, ed., \\"Gaspar de S. Miguel‚Äôs Arte da Lingoa Canarim, parte 2a, Sintaxis copiossisima na lingoa Bramana e pollida,\\" Journal of the University of Bombay [Sept. 1967] 3-5, as cited in J. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India, vol. II: From the Middle of the Sixteenth to the End of the Seventeenth Century (1542-1700) [Bangalore: TPI for CHAI, 1982] 409). The name canarim or lingua canarim, which is how Thomas Stephens himself refers to it in the title of his famous grammar, has always been intriguing. It is possible that the term is derived from the Persian word for coast, kinara; if so, it would be means \\"the language of the coast.\\" The problem is that this term overlaps with Kanarese or Kannada. It is therefore not surprising to find Mariano Saldanha calling absurd the appellation lingua canarim, since the language of Goa, being derived from Sanskrit, has nothing to do with Kannada, which is a Dravidian language. The missionaries, who certainly travelled to Kanara as well, must have realized the infelicity of the term, but, not being philologists, continued to follow the current practice. Thus Stephens speaks of the lingua canarim, and a Portuguese missionary called his work Arte Canarina da lingoa do Norte, referring to the Konkanized Marathi of the northern provinces of Bassein, Bandra, and Bombay.Arte Canarina na lingoa do Norte. Anonymous MS, edited by Cunha Rivara under the title: Gram√°tica da Lingua Concani no dialecto do Norte, composta no seculo XVII por um Mission√°rio Portugues; e agora pela primeira vez dada √† estampa (Nova Goa: Imprensa Nacional, 1858). Cunha Rivara suggested that the author was either a Franciscan or a Jesuit residing in Thana on the island of Salcete; hence the reference to a \\"Portuguese missionary\\" in the title. All the authors, however, recognized in Goa two forms of the language: the plebeian, called canarim, and the more regular, used by the educated classes, called lingua canarim br√°mana or simply br√°mana de Goa. Since the latter was the preferred choice of the Europeans (and also of other castes) for writing, sermons and religious purposes, it was this that became the norm for all the grammars, including that of Stephens'. The licence of the Ordinary given to his work refers to it as \\"arte da lingua canarin bramana\\". For his PurƒÅ·πáa, Stephens preferred to use Marathi, and gives explicit notice of his choice, even though he also notes that he mixes this with the local \\"language of the Brahmins\\" so as to make his work more accessible.M. Saldanha 717-718. He was therefore well aware of the difference between Marathi and what he chose to call canarim.

The section from Eberswalde to Werbig junction is now a branch line, the adjoining section to the south to Frankfurt (Oder) is classified as a main line. The line is about 86 kilometres long and is served by line RB60 of the Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn (NEB). Route ODEG DMU in Niederfinow station The line starts at Eberswalde Hauptbahnhof and separates to it north from the Berlin‚ÄìSzczecin railway and runs to the east. The direct connection from this line towards Szczecin has been dismantled. The line runs parallel with the Finow Canal at first and then swings to the southeast after Niederfinow station. The line runs parallel to the Alte Oder, the westerly outflow of the Oderbruch swamp, through Bad Freienwalde and Wriezen, both former railway junctions, to Werbig station, which is built on two-level as an interchange with the Prussian Eastern Railway. After Werbig it runs south via Seelow to the end of the line at Frankfurt (Oder) station. In Boo√üen there used to be a junction with the line to K√ºstrin-Kietz, which was dismantled after World War II. History Eberswalde Hauptbahnhof The line was built in 1865/66 as a single-track line by the Berlin-Stettin Railway Company () and opened between Eberswalde and Wriezen on 15 December 1866 as a branch line. The main purpose of the railway was to promote the development of the Oderbruch. The continuation of the line to Frankfurt, however, was soon required. The implementation of this project was, however, to take another ten years and construction only started as a result of the construction of the parallel Wroclaw‚ÄìSzczecin railway of the Breslau-Schweidnitz-Freiburg Railway Company (Breslau-Schweidnitz-Freiburger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). The latter planned to build its line as a direct link between the Upper Silesian coal basin and the Baltic Sea. Since the BStE expected this would lead to a loss of revenue, it decided to build a largely parallel line west of the Oder using existing sections of the Lower Silesian-M√§rkisch Railway and the Berlin- Stettin main line. The extension to Frankfurt (Oder) was opened in three sections: *1 July 1876: Wriezen‚ÄìLetschin *1 January 1877: Letschin‚ÄìSeelow *15 May 1877: Seelow‚ÄìFrankfurt (Oder). Together with the 30 kilometre long Angerm√ºnde‚ÄìFreienwalde line, which was opened on 1 January 1877, this created a second direct railway between Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) and Stettin (Szczecin). Although the line linked to existing junctions such as Frankfurt (Oder), it gained importance as an alternative to the line on the east side of the Oder and especially for the carriage of local traffic. Stations were construction between Bad Freienwalde and Frankfurt on the line in Wriezen, Letschin, Neutrebbin, Letschin, Seelow and Sch√∂nflie√ü. In July 1880, a two-level interchange station was opened at Werbig at the intersection with the Eastern Railway to Berlin and a station was opened in Alt-Ranft. In May 1881, stations were opened in Boo√üen and Dolgelin and, in 1882, a connecting curve to the Eastern Railway was opened in Werbig for freight. A station was also built in Sietzing in this period. Carzig station was established later and Libbenichen station was built in the 1930s. After the nationalisation of the BStE in 1879, the entire line was transferred to the Prussian state railways as part of the Royal Division of the Berlin-Stettin Railway (K√∂niglichen Direktion der Berlin-Stettiner Eisenbahn, called K√∂nigliche Eisenbahndirektion Stettin from 1905). This led to the duplication of the line between Eberswalde and Freienwalde in 1905. Niederfinow station about 1901 At the beginning of the 20th century, plans were developed to establish a separate marshalling yard because of limited space in Frankfurt station. After much discussion about the location of the new yard, it was eventually decided to build it on the Eberswalde line between Frankfurt and Boo√üen. The line in this section had to be moved to the east and Boo√üen station was also moved. Work began on 1 April 1910 and work on the infrastructure was largely completed at the beginning of the First World War. Because many tracks were occupied by the military during the war, its commissioning was delayed to 1917. Connecting lines were built from Rosengarten on the line to Berlin and from Boo√üen to W√ºste Kunersdorf junction near Lebus on the line to K√ºstrin. The line between Frankfurt and Boo√üen was duplicated. After 1920, the line and the railway division of Stettin were absorbed into the railway division (Reichsbahndirektion) of Stettin of Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1926, a railcar shuttle service was established between Frankfurt and Boo√üen, serving in particular the extensive facilities of the marshalling yard. For the service, popularly called the Pendel (pendulum), a separate platform was created in Frankfurt station; it was about the length of a modern tram stop. Table 123d of the 1944/45 timetable included around nine pairs of trains running daily between Berlin, Eberswalde and Wriezen and four pairs of trains running between Wriezen and Frankfurt (Oder). Between the Frankfurt suburb Boo√üen and Frankfurt (Oder), there were additional suburban trains, which were shown in table 123e as operating almost hourly. The services running to and from Eberswalde did not stop at the three intermediate stations of Paulinenhof, Simonsm√ºhle and Gronenfelde, which were served by the shuttle trains. During the fighting around Berlin at the end of the Second World War in 1945 the line was in the main combat zone, notably of the Battle of the Seelow Heights. The Wehrmacht operated a special armoured train from Sch√∂nflie√ü. As a result of hostilities, the track was badly damaged and many bridges were destroyed. Developments after 1945 Station building in Frankfurt (Oder) After the Second World War, the second track between Eberswalde and Bad Freienwalde was removed for reparations. After severe war damage the track had to be rebuilt, as more than half of the bridges were destroyed on many sections. In March 1947, a severe flood caused new damage. The shuttle train between Frankfurt and Boo√üen as well as the intermediate stations in Simonsm√ºhle and Paulinenhof were abandoned in 1945 as well as the direct operation of passenger trains between Bad Freienwalde and Berlin via Eberswalde. The declaration of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line as the border with Poland, however, meant that the line gained in importance, as it was near the border and was used as a strategic railway. It was also of interest as a possible bypass for the Berlin node. In 1952, Deutsche Reichsbahn built a direct connecting curve of the track to the north in Eberswalde, so as to relieve congestion in Eberswalde station. It was particularly important for freight. from the 1960s, the line was used by direct express trains from Angerm√ºnde via Bad Freienwalde to Frankfurt (Oder), sometimes running further south. Summer holiday trains from Saxony to the Baltic Sea coast also ran on the line. For example, in 1983, the line was served by an express train between Angerm√ºnde and Dresden, an express train between Angerm√ºnde and Frankfurt (with through coaches from Schwedt) and a summer semi-fast train between Stralsund and Zittau. In addition there six pairs of stopping trains ran over the whole line, with some additional services between Eberswalde and Bad Freienwalde or Wriezen and trains ran between Kietz (now K√ºstrin-Kietz) and Frankfurt, which following the dismantling of the direct route in 1945 took the Eberswalde line to Boo√üen. Since the early 1960s, the line from Eberswalde to the Werbig connecting curve has been classified as only a branch line. The southern part of the route has continued to be classified as a main line and was upgraded to a speed of 100 km/h. At the end of the 1980s, the electrification of the line was considered. The political change in East Germany (Die Wende) and the resulting economic changes ended these considerations. In passenger transport, the two express services were initially retained. In the 1993/1994 timetable, services increased to three express trains from Eberswalde to Frankfurt, stopping at Bad Freienwalde, Wriezen, Werbig and Seelow, with two of them continuing to Dresden. Intermediate stations on the middle part of the line were each served by six pairs of passenger trains. On the outer sections services were denser. In 1994, the service was changed fundamentally. The stops in Sietzing, Dolgelin, Libbenichen, Carzig and Sch√∂nflie√ü Dorf were closed and trains ran over the whole route stopping at the remaining stations every two hours. The trains to Kustrin stopped in Boo√üen and Frankfurt-Klingethal until 1996. After 2000, the services to Eberswalde continued to Berlin. The trains ran every hour to Wriezen and every two hours continued to Frankfurt. On the one hand, the former operator, Deutsche Bahn, hoped this would increase passenger numbers, and on the other, this measure was necessary because the direct connection with Berlin via Wriezen on the Wriezen Railway had been closed in 1998. The Regionalbahn service RB 60 was extended to Berlin-Lichtenberg in the meantime as Regional-Express service RE 7, but this was abandoned after a year. At the timetable change on 12 December 2004, Ostdeutsche Eisenbahn took over the operation of passenger services on the line. For marketing reasons, the service was known as OE 60. Since the timetable change on 9 December 2012, the line has been operated as RB60. At the timetable change on 14 December 2014 the Niederbarnimer Eisenbahn took over the operation of passengers services on the route, using Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 DMUs. Trains run, every hour on weekdays and every two hours on weekends between Eberswalde and Wriezen.

Salisbury New York Times:James F. Bonner, 86; Studied Gene Regulation,By KAREN FREEMAN, September 19, 1996 a member of the National Academy of Sciences, notable for discoveries in plant biochemistry. Bonner invented a better way to collect natural rubber from trees.Los Angeles Times:James F. Bonner; Improved Citrus Harvesting Methods,September 21, 1996 As result of his invention Malaysia nearly doubled its production of natural rubber. Bonner was instrumental in the invention of a method of mechanical harvesting of oranges. One of his most notable discoveries was finding how histones control gene activity. Bonner was professor and professor emeritus of biology at the California Institute of Technology.  Career  Bonner was born in Ansley, Nebraska in 1910. He graduated from the University of Utah in 1931 with B.A. degree in chemistry and mathematics. He received the Ph.D. in biology at California Institute of Technology in 1934. Bonner spent the year after his PhD in Europe on a National Research Council fellowship at Utrecht, Leiden and ETH in Zurich. He was a postdoctoral fellow at California Institute of Technology after his return from Europe, then joined the faculty in 1936.  Plant Physiology  Early in his career, he invented a method for collecting rubber tree exudate (natural rubber) that greatly improved the efficiency of the process. He also invented a mechanical method for harvesting oranges. He studied the timing of processes in plants. Histones In the dawn of molecular biology in the 1960s, his interest turned to gene expression, in particular the regulation of production of RNA from genes. Experiments in his laboratory in collaboration with his postdoctoral fellow Ru Chih C. HuangJames F. Bonner. (1994)\\"Chapters from my life\\" Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol 45:1-23. showed that histone, a protein associated with the genes, shuts off gene activity.Campos and Reinberg (2009) \\"Historic perspective on histones\\" Annu Rev Genetics 43 (Supplement: Histones, Annotating Chromatin). If the histone fraction is extracted from isolated chromatin, more RNA is made whereas if histone is added back, the transcription of RNA is greatly decreased. In the course of these experiments, Huang and Bonner discovered DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but Bonner noted in a biographical article that several other groups discovered the enzyme simultaneously. They decided to focus on regulation rather than simply RNA production. Bonner continued to work on histones, establishing methods reproducibly to isolate each type of histone, along with graduate student Douglas Fambrough. Eventually they purified individual histones from pea plants and from calf thymus and showed, in collaboration with Emil Smith at UCLA, that the amino acid compositions and sequences of the same type of histone (histone H4) isolated from these widely disparate organisms were virtually identical.Robert DeLange, Douglas Fambrough, Emil Smith, and James Bonner (1968) \\"Calf and Pea Histone IV: I Amino acid compositions and identical and identical COOH-terminal 19-residue sequence\\" J Biol Chem 243 (22): 5906-5913.Robert DeLange, Douglas Fambrough, Emil Smith, and James F.

Early years Born about 1827, Kill Eagle was the son of a Brul√© father and a Sihasapa mother. His father may have been the first leader of a small Sihasapa band known as the Wazhazha (not to be confused with a Brule/Oglala band by the same name). Kill Eagle gained prominence through one of the \\"soldiers societies\\" (akicita). In 1864, he helped return the white captive, Fanny Kelly.New York Herald, 24 Sept., 6 Oct. 1876. By 1866, Kill Eagle had assumed his father's role as leader of the Wazhazha band (Sihasapa). He signed the Treaty of 1868 at Fort Rice, agreeing to settle his band on the Great Sioux Reservation.Kappler, Indian Treaties. By the early 1870s, his band was the second largest among the Sihasapa and had settled on the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Agency in present northern South Dakota. They experimented with farming and received rations from the Office of Indian Affairs through the Indian agent at Standing Rock. Great Sioux War, 1876-77 Map of the Little Bighorn Battlefield, 1876. This map was created by Capt. Robert E. Johnston, acting Indian Agent at the Standing Rock Agency, based on Kill Eagle's interview about the famous battle. Courtesy National Archives. In the spring of 1876, an embargo on the sale of ammunition to the Lakota was put in place as part of the escalation of the government's conflict with the Lakota over the Black Hills. While this policy was intended to limit access to ammunition for the non-treaty (\\"hostile\\") bands such as that of Sitting Bull, it also impacted friendly bands on the reservation such as that of Kill Eagle. Concerned that rations were not sufficient to feed his people, Kill Eagle illegally departed Standing Rock in May 1876 with approximately 26 lodges, heading out on a buffalo hunt. The remainder of Kill Eagle's band remained at Standing Rock under the leadership of Red Hawk. The lodges with Kill Eagle successfully killed buffalo but then inadvertently ended up in the main Indian non-treaty Indian village that had gathered for the annual sundance. They soon found themselves caught up in the Great Sioux War. Kill Eagle was abused when he refused to join in the fight against the army at the Battle of the Rosebud and he also appears to have stayed out of the fighting at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Kill Eagle and his lodges managed to slip away from the main village and surrendered at the Standing Rock Agency on September 15, 1876. He was interviewed by army officers about the Little Bighorn and his comments were widely reported in the press, one of the first native perspectives of Custer's defeat. He also gave information for one of the earliest maps of the battleground.New York Herald, 24 Sept., 6 Oct. 1876. Graham, Custer Myth, 48-56. Donahue, Drawing Battle Lines, 138-143. Dickson, \\"Prisoners in the Indian Camp.\\" Kill Eagle and his followers were treated as prisoners of war for nearly a year, with another prominent Sihasapa named Goose serving as band leader. Standing Rock Reservation Kill Eagle was again recognized as band leader for the Wazhazha in 1877 and he remained at Standing Rock for the remainder of his life. In the Sitting Bull Surrender Census, taken in September 1881, Kill Eagle is shown as leader of a small band of 25 families, totaling 123 people. Kill Eagle's own family included his wife, First Born, and three daughters named Medicine Woman, Foolish Woman and Pretty Face. He had four horses, five cows, two dogs and twelve chickens. The census also noted that Kill Eagle had cultivated two acres for the past two years and had cut twelve tons of hay and produced 37 1/2 bushels of corn.Dickson, Sitting Bull Surrender Census, 193 Kill Eagle disappeared from the census and rations records in 1885, suggesting that he died sometime during that year.

There are all kinds of shops on 238 Street, of which brand and boutique stores account for 83% of the total business area of 87,000 square meters. Hunan Road is one of the most bustling commercial streets of the ancient Nanjing city. History Construction Hunan Road extension was built in 1927, at which time Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China. Some of the new extensions of the road were named according to their geographical position, or the provincial or city name. In this way, the new extension of the road was named Hunan Road. Political events In the time of the Republic of China, Hunan Road was a compelling place. The Senate Interim Government of the Republic of China and the KMT headquarters had put their offices in this road. Several important events have occurred here, such as: * Organizing the central provisional government * Electing Provisional President of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen * Sun Fengming's assassination attempt on Wang Ching- weihttp://www.f-paper.com/?i634669-Photo:-Sun-Fengming-%22thorn-Wang%22-who- risk-into-a-scapegoat * Chen Bray's suicide Sun Fengming's assassination attempt on Wang Ching-wei is especially noteworthy because it ignited the country and the world.

Its length is 330 meters, and width is 12‚Äì16 meters. The street was originally a farmer's market. In early 2000, the Gulou District invested 8.8 million yuan for comprehensive reform. This included a full range of granite paving, a new color landscape dry fountain, planters, landscape lights, lounge chairs, public telephone kiosks and other public facilities. All residential buildings along the street applied for new European technology and put a Lion landmark on the buildings. Lion Walk Food Street units include financial, lighting, automation, landscaping and cleaning. It has gathered nearly 40 businesses, including food, restaurants and noodles. In a trial operation from June 2000 to the end of 2000, the whole turnover was 48 million yuan and rent of $ 2.4 million was paid. In the first 6 months of 2001, the total turnover was more than 52 million and 2.52 million yuan was turned over to rent.

The line was originally the main trunk for the Grand Trunk Railway between these cities, although there has been some realignment of the route between these cities. The majority of the Kingston Sub runs close to the northern bank of Lake Ontario and the Saint Lawrence River. The infrastructure consists of twin tracks, on which over 50 pieces of interlocking crossover tracks are grafted all along the subdivision. The extra length of these crossover tracks allows for high speed track interchange. Low gravity intermodal container trains are allowed to change tracks at 45 miles per hour, and VIA Rail's passenger trains, at 60. The governing traffic control system is CTC. Since 1995, no OCS operation clearance forms need to be filled by train conductors on the Kingston Subdivision. CTC signals thus provide both permission and authorization for train movements, as is the situation with most main line operation at CN. Just east of Newcastle, east of Toronto, the line is joined by the CP Belleville Subdivision, Canadian Pacific Railway's similar mainline route. The two remain nearly side-by-side to the east of Belleville, where the Belleville sub turns north to Smiths Falls. Sections of the Kingston Sub are no longer owned by CN. In particular, CN mainline freight traffic in the Toronto area no longer follows the Kingston Sub, and is re-directed north of the city along the York Sub. The section between Pickering Junction and Union Station in downtown Toronto has been sold to Metrolinx for GO Transit service, part of their Lakeshore East line. Stations The 1850s Grand Trunk Railway mainline consisted of 34 stations, many of which have been removed from service or no longer exist. Lansdowne station was torn down soon after CN abandoned service to the village in 1966; CN demolished an Iroquois station in 2002.http://www.trainweb.org/ontariostations/statdund.htm Stations currently on the Toronto-Montr√©al mainline include: * Union Station (Toronto) * GO Transit (no VIA service) at Danforth, Scarborough, Eglinton in Toronto * Guildwood * Commuter stations in Rouge Hill/Pickering, Ajax and Whitby serve GO Transit; No VIA service * Oshawa GO Station * Port Hope railway station * Cobourg railway station * Brighton (not in use, now part of Memory Junction railway museumhttp://www.northumberlandnews.com/community- story/3770146-looking-back-in-brighton-memory-junction-railway-station/) * Trenton Junction railway station * Belleville station (Ontario) * Napanee railway station * Ernestown (not in use) * Kingston railway station (Ontario) * Kingston Outer Station (abandoned, in ruins) * Gananoque railway station * Brockville railway station * Prescott (not in use, now houses Grenville historical society and archives) * Near Morrisburg, two historic stations from The Lost Villages were relocated but did not return to service.

Some have integrated flatbeds, some are discrete tractor units, and some are configured to spread a load between the tractor unit and a dollied trailer pulled behind it. Often more than one trailer is attached.  History  Moreland trucks with solid tires on Moses Mountain in the 1920s The most convenient trees to cut down were those near waterways for easy transportation. As the supply dwindled and loggers had to go further from water, they used teams of oxen or horses for hauling. These were superseded by steam-powered donkeys and locomotives. The final development was the logging truck. A truck was used for logging in Covington, Washington, in 1913. The coming of World War I and the resulting demand for the Pacific Northwest's Sitka spruce for airplanes \\"established log trucking in Washington\\". The United States Army assigned thousands of men to the Spruce Production Division to build roads into western Washington to harvest the dispersed stands of the best trees. After the war ended, a plenitude of surplus military trucks made their adoption attractive to logging companies, particularly smaller outfits that could not afford expensive locomotives. The primitive trucks were improved in the 1920s and 1930s, with more powerful engines and better braking systems. The old \\"narrow, solid rubber‚Äîsometimes steel‚Äîtreadless tires\\" were replaced by wider pneumatic ones with treads. Plank roads gave way to graded dirt ones. By the mid-1930s, trucks were hauling as much timber out of the Pacific Northwest as the railroads. World War II saw improved truck designs, and once again these were passed along to logging companies through the sale of surplus military vehicles after the war was over. Configuration B double logging truck in Australia There are two main types of modern logging trucks -- those used on rough ground and trails in the forest where they are felled and those used for transport on normal highways and roads. Because the roads in forests are rough and often temporary, the suspension and tires of an offroad truck are especially significant. Solid, low pressure and high pressure tires have been used. As many as nine axles may be used to provide low ground pressure and good traction. Timber is commonly grown in hilly country unsuitable for farming and so the ability of a log truck to climb a gradient is significant. The steepness depends on the quality of the surface - mud and snow are harder to climb than gravel and soil. For a manageable gradient, the speed will then depend upon the power of the truck. The legal weight limits will vary by jurisdiction but, for example, in the southern states of the USA, they range from -- about . To load the logs, the truck may be fitted with one or more winches or cranes. The logs are commonly unloaded by letting them roll off sideways. Manufacturers of log trucks include Peterbilt, Hayes Truck, Kenworth, Scania AB, and Volvo.

Alegr√≠a (July 17, 1886 ‚Äì July 29, 1965), was a poet, writer, lawyer and politician. Alegr√≠a was a founding member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and president of the political organization from 1928 to 1930. Early years Alegr√≠a was born in the town of Dorado, Puerto Rico where he received his primary and secondary education. In 1901, he earned a teachers certificate. Alegr√≠a became interested in politics at a young age and when he was 16 years old, he founded the Federal Youth Committee of the Federal Party in the town of Barceloneta. His family sent him to the United States to continue his college education. He attended Valparaiso University, in Indiana and in 1908 earned his law degree.LexJuris Political career When he returned to Puerto Rico, he joined the Union Party of Puerto Rico. The Union Party was founded in February 1904 by Luis Mu√±oz Rivera, Rosendo Matienzo Cintr√≥n, Antonio R. Barcel√≥, Jos√© de Diego and others after the disbanding of the Federal Party. The party supported greater self-government for the island, though the party was divided between those in favor of independence and those favoring statehood. The party was highly successful electorally through the 1930s.*Jos√© Tr√≠as Monge, Puerto Rico: The Trials of the Oldest Colony in the World (Yale University Press, 1997) Alegr√≠a was named municipal judge of the town of Salinas. He also served as the municipal judge of the towns of Santa Isabel and Manat√≠ in different occasions. In 1919, Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠, a member of the Union Party, felt that the party was not doing enough for the cause of Puerto Rican independence and with his followers founded the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico in San Juan. By the 1920s there were two other pro- independence organizations in the Island: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association of Puerto Rico. The Independence Association was founded by Alegr√≠a, Eugenio Font Su√°rez and Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa in 1920. On September 17, 1922, these three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and Coll y Cuchi was elected president. Alegr√≠a followed Coll y Cuchi and was elected vice-president. In 1924, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and was also named vice- president. By 1930, disagreements between Coll y Cuchi and Albizu Campos as to how the party should be run, led the former and his followers to abandon the party and return to the Union Party. Alegr√≠a was named party president in 1928 and held that position until 1930. On May 11, 1930, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. El Nuevo Dia In 1932, Alegr√≠a joined the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico, a pro-independence political party. In 1936, he was elected to the House of Representatives in the Puerto Rican legislature and served in that position until 1940. Arts During the 1930s, Alegr√≠a presided over the \\"Casino de Puerto Rico\\". As such he became interested in the visual arts. He learned some painting techniques from Puerto Rican artist Francisco Oller and from Fernando D√≠az Mckenna. From 1938 to 1949, he was the director of the magazine \\"Puerto Rico Illustrado\\", there he published some of his poems under the name of Raimundo Lucio. Among his written works are the following: * \\"Antolog√≠a de poetas j√≥venes de Puerto Rico\\" (Anthology of young poets of Puerto Rico) (1918) *\\"Cr√≥nicas fr√≠volas\\" (Frivolous Chronics) (1938) *\\"Retablos de la aldea\\" (Altarpieces of the village) (1949) *\\"El alma de la aldea\\" (The soul of a village) (1956) *\\"Cartas a Florinda\\" (Letters to Florinda) (1958) *\\"Rosas y flechas\\" (Roses and arrows) (1958) Later years Alegr√≠a was the President of the Puerto Rican Institute of Hispanic Culture.

Taxonomy This genus was originally created by J. K. Frenkel in 1977. Its use was discontinued but was resurrected in 2005. This genus currently includes species that have oocysts containing two sporocysts with four sporozoites in each without Stieda bodies. These species infect the enterocytes of mammals and are transmitted by the orofaecal route. DNA analysis has shown that this genus belongs to the family Sarcocystidae. The type species of this genus is Cystoisospora felis. Life cycle This parasite has been isolated from dogs, cats and raccoons. C. belli has been isolated from immunosuppressed humans ‚Äî particularly those with HIV infection. These parasites normally infect the enterocytes of the small intestine and are spread by the orofaecal route. The definitive hosts are cats but other species including various species of rodents may be infected. No further development occurs in these paratenic hosts and the parasites remain dormant until ingested by a definitive host. Epidemiology This genus has been recorded worldwide. C. felis and C. rivolta occur in up to 40% of cats in some tropical countries. Clinical Clinical signs include watery diarrhea, vomiting, fever and weight loss. The diagnosis is made by microscopic examination of the stool. Distinguishing between the species of Cystoisospora is most easily done with PCR. This method can also be used to make the diagnosis. Treatment is based on trimethoprim-sulfonamides with clindamycin or toltrazuril for resistant strains. Prevention Hygiene on the premises is important in prevention. Good litter tray hygiene is also critical in multi-cat households. Utensils, runs, cages and other implements should be steam-cleaned or washed in boiling water. Because of the importance of paratenic hosts such as cockroaches, insect control is critical.

Its function is unknown, but based on sequence and structure conservation, it is predicted to target the ribosomal binding site (RBS) area in the 5‚Äô UTR of various genes. It was found that expression of tsRNAs within E. coli inhibits E. coli growth, in a mechanism which is still unknown (and hence the name Toxic Small RNA). Several paralogous loci may encode similar (but not identical) tsRNAs in each coding genome. Experiments with four species of the Burkholderia lineage showed conserved and constitutive expression of tsRNAs in logarithmic growth phases. In Burkholderia cenocepacia four tsRNAs were expressed to high levels during biofilm growth. Two of these are located in intergenic regions, the other two are located in the 3 prime untranslated region of messenger RNA.

The regiment was raised in Palestine in 1918, from soldiers that had been serving with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and assigned to the 5th Light Horse Brigade. During the war the regiment fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire, in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and was awarded fourteen battle honours. During the inter- war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. It was later converted to a motor regiment during the Second World War but was disbanded in 1944 without having been deployed overseas. In the post war period, the regiment was briefly re- formed, before being amalgamated into the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers in 1956. Formation The 15th Light Horse Regiment was raised in Palestine in June 1918, from Australian soldiers serving in the disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and comprised twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullett 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse The Camel Corps were all trained infantrymen, and some of them had previously served with the Australian Light Horse regiments, but all required a period of training in horsemanship. Once formed, the regiment was assigned to the 5th Light Horse Brigade, alongside a French regiment and the 14th Light Horse Regiment. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted infantry armed with rifles, not swords or lances, and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullett 1941, p. 29. trooper of the 15th Light Horse Regiment Operational history Sinai and Palestine Campaign By the time the regiment was ready for service, the war in the Middle East was almost over. The regiment fought in only one major battle at Megiddo in September 1918. Over ten days the 5th Light Horse Brigade advanced destroying road and rail links, and pursuing the retreating Ottoman Army into Syria. They entered Damascus on 1 October 1918. When the war ended the regiment was recalled to Egypt to assist in policing a riot that had broken out, before returning to Australia. The war cost the regiment sixteen killed and only three wounded, but for their service they were awarded fourteen battle honours, most of them inherited from the disbanded Imperial Camel Corps. Perpetuation In 1921, Australia's part-time military forces were re-organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF following its demobilisation.Grey 2008, p. 125. Through this process, the 15th Light Horse was re-raised as a Citizens Forces unit within the 2nd Military District in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, drawing lineage from the 5th Australian Light Horse Regiment (New South Wales Mounted Rifles), which had been formed in 1903. This unit remained in existence throughout the inter-war years, and in December 1941 it was converted into a motor regiment, adopting the designation of the \\"15th Motor Regiment (Northern River Lancers). In 1942, the regiment was re-designated the \\"15th Australian Motor Regiment\\" and was gazetted as an AIF unit,Festberg 1972, p. 49. meaning that it could be deployed outside of Australian territory to fight if necessary.Grey 2008, p. 183. Nevertheless, the regiment was deemed surplus to requirements and on 12 October 1944 it was disbanded without having seen operational service during World War II. During the war years, the regiment was variously assigned to the 1st Armoured and 2nd Motor Brigades. In the post war period, Australia's part- time force was re-raised and in July 1948 the regiment was reformed as a single squadron, with the designation of the \\"A Squadron, 15th Amphibious Assault Regiment (Northern River Lancers)\\". The following year it was re- designated the \\"15th Northern River Lancers\\". In 1952, the squadron was expanded into a full regiment due to the influx of national servicemen, but in 1956 the regiment was amalgamated with the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers to form the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers.Festberg 1972, p. 37.Finlayson 2012, p. 334.

Described by media as a more optimistic version of Elliott Smith, Peasant toured extensively in both Europe and the US, sharing the stage with acts such as Cursive, Dr. Dog, Horse Feathers, Dan Mangan, Delta Spirit, Rocky Votolato, Sharon Van Etten, Chris Pureka, Hop Along, Illinois, Albert Hammond Jr., Liz Green and many others. Biography Damien Nicholas DeRose grew up in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, a small town where he began writing and recording in his bedroom in high school. He first toured the greater part of the U.S. in 2005 as a solo artist. The following year, he self-released his first collection of recordings, Fear Not Distant Lover; and toured the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands. Upon returning home, Peasant toured the U.S. a second time, and ended in Canada for Montreal‚Äôs 2006 Popfest. Soon after the Popfest, he signed his first official record deal with Paper Garden Records and began recording On The Ground with Paul and Ryan Cobb (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club et al.) ‚ÄòThe Cobbs‚Äô. On the Ground was released in 2008 on Paper Garden Records. The album was distributed through Conor Oberst‚Äôs label, Team Love. In 2009, Peasant recorded a Daytrotter Session and was featured on NPR's All Songs Considered blog \\"Second Stage\\" In addition to being featured on Bones, two songs from On The Ground, \\"Fine is Fine\\" and \\"Those Days,\\" were featured on ABC‚Äôs Kyle XY; and \\"Fine is Fine\\" was featured on Showtime‚Äôs United States of Tara. In 2010, Peasant released his 3rd album, Shady Retreat, which was entirely recorded on his own and had songs from it featured on a number of network shows, including ABC's Private Practice. In 2012, Peasant released Bound for Glory on Schnitzel Records. Shortly after, MTV featured Peasant‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmends‚Äô on its Stop/Watch program, where DeRose debuted his band at MTV's Time Square Studio. The newly formed live band appeared on BBC Radio with Marc Riley while on tour in the UK and sold out shows across the continent from Zurich to London. Music from Bound for Glory has also been used by NBC‚Äôs Parenthood, CBS‚Äôs The Good Wife and, again, Private Practice. Damien DeRose struggled with the disease of addiction for years before stumbling into a criminal act of burglary, for which he paid his time incarcerated, and made restitution, at a time addiction was not seen as the disease it is, and many followed this route before dying, or for the luckier ones, surviving this brain altering disease. Released in 2015, Damien DeRose remained in recovery until a fatal relapse on Nov 4, 2015. He is remembered not for his crime but for his true character and great loss to the music community. Damien DeRose remained humble and contrite with honest ambition to make amends and pay back to society in any way he could via music and awareness,and addiction support for all those affected by the disease. His family remains forever tormented by his suffering and his devastating loss too young. Damien's successful self made rise in music and beloved place in his family and community both override and spotlight the devastating costs of addiction that can lead to crime and acts of desperation. He will be remembered not for his mistakes, or his disease, but for his achievements and all the people who respect and love him still as the truly beautiful, inspiring person he was. DeRose died in November 2015 after being in a coma for over two weeks. DeRose's family and friends posthumously released a collection of unreleased songs on an album titled Home, which was released in December 2016.A second release entitled \\"Ancient Buried Scenes\\" was released in 2019. Both were intended for release by Damien before his death. There remain hundreds of songs his mother intends to release in near future. Several associated artists collaborate to make this possible.

Early life Allen was born on October 20, 1803 near Westfield, Massachusetts. He was the fourth son of Samuel and Ruth (n√©e Falley) Allen. He received his early education at Westfield Academy and Franklin, Connecticut. He studied law in Baltimore in the office of William Wirt while running a school with a friend. But he found himself obliged to seek a more active life on account of his health. Career In 1833, he went to Buffalo, New York, and involved himself in mercantile pursuits. His ambition was, through investments in land, to earn enough to take up a life of study and travel. The Panic of 1837 quashed these plans, and he passed the next seven years on his farm on the Niagara River. In 1842, he started the American Agriculturist in partnership with his elder brother, Anthony B. Allen, but soon after left for New Orleans on a business venture. In 1847, he rejoined his brother, now in New York City, where he had established an agricultural business in connection with the journal. Richard L. Allen resided on Staten Island with his family. In 1856 American Agriculturist was sold to Orange Judd, and the brothers opened a warehouse for supplying improved agricultural implements. Personal life In December 1834, he married Sarah Outram \\"Sally\\" Lyman (1812‚Äì1892), the daughter of the Hon. Jonathan Huntington Lyman and Sophia Hinckley Lyman. Together, they were the parents of: * Richard Hinckley Allen (1838‚Äì1908), an amateur naturalist who married Mary Campbell Wallace. * Mary Isabel Allen (1840‚Äì1908), who died unmarried in Northampton, Massachusetts. * Huntington Lyman Allen (1843‚Äì1844), who died in infancy. * Arthur Huntington Allen (1851‚Äì1923), a Presbyterian minister who married Agnes Crosby (1858‚Äì1891), daughter of the Rev. Dr. Howard Crosby, Chancellor of New York University. In 1866, three members of Allen's family sailed for Europe. Allen was not able to join them until 1868, and died in Sweden in 1869.

Life Born in 1889 in the village of Mediak in Chelyabinsk province, Orenburg Governorate (these days in the Argayashsky District, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia) to the family of the religious leader of a local Islamic community; his father Gabidulla Kurbangaliev was the local Imam khatib and a religious teacher who had a number of followers (Murids). Received instruction in the local medrese founded by this father, then in the medrese Rasulia in Troitsk. Taught in the medrese in his home village. Embarked on a promising clerical career. In 1916, he was preparing to become Russia's head Mufti as Mukhammat-Safa Bayazitov‚Äôs successor (see Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly). These plans were foiled by the Russian Revolution and the subsequent Civil War. In 1916, Muhammed Kurbangaliev took the post of the head of the Saint-Petersburg Muslim district. Civil War In 1917, became active as a Bashkir public figure championing Bashkir community‚Äôs interests in the country undergoing dramatic political and social changes. Promoted the foundation of Argayash National Okrug, a Bashkir ethnic administration region in the north of the present-day Chelyabinsk Oblast. Participated in the 1st and 2nd All-Bashkir Congress (Kurultay) in July and August 1917. Advocated an autonomous spiritual administration for Bashkortostan‚Äôs Muslim community; opposed to nationalizing land in any format. Together with his father, acted as the main opponent of Zeki Velidi Togan in the Bashkir national and liberation movement. Disagreed with Velidi when the latter took the Soviet side to preserve the Bashkir autonomy, and in the name of all Bashkirs announced support for Aleksandr Kolchak‚Äôs administration. Participated in the White movement, became one of the leader of Bashkir military units within Kolchak‚Äôs army. In the summer of 1919, he attempted to arrange a new All-Bashkir Congress in the city of Chelyabinsk, then retreated eastward together with Kolchak‚Äôs army. Entered into alliances with White Movement‚Äôs military leaders: Vladimir Kappel, Roman Ungern von Sternberg, Grigory Semyonov to protect Bashkirs‚Äô interests. Emigration In October 1920, Kolchak's army with the affiliated Bashkir troops suffered a major defeat, surrendering the city of Chita to the Red Army. Muhammed Kurbangaliev emigrated to Manchuria, where he attempted to bring together the √©migr√© Bashkir and Turkic-speaking communities, arrange for traditional Islamic religious practices among them, support native-language instruction, acting as an Imam and mudarris (teacher). In 1924, moved to Japan, founded a Muslim community (mahallah called Islamiya) in Tokyo and became its religious leader. In 1927, opened a school for Japan's Muslims. In 1928, convened an all-Japan Muslims‚Äô Congress. Opened print works which printed books in Arabic. Traveled extensively around the entire Japan preaching Islam, published several books about Turkic peoples and their histories. In 1932-1936, founded a Muslim community in Manchukuo, a medrese in Mukden, a publication called ‚Äù–Ø–ø–æ–Ω –ú”©—Ö–±–∏—Ä–µ‚Äù (Yapon M√∂xbire ‚ÄúJapan‚Äôs Herald‚Äù in Turkic languages). Published the first-ever Quran in the Far East. He developed relationships with Korean and Manchurian businessmen and established close personal relations with Japan's military leaders: Ogasawara Naganari, Nango Judiro, politicians ≈åkuma Shigenobu, T≈çyama Mitsuru (leader of Geny≈çsha). He also received funds from Japan's financial oligarchies to support his religious and public activities. On May 12, 1938, he opened the mosque \\"Islamiya\\" in Tokyo and became Japan's first Mufti. Japan's Muslim √©migr√© community was involved in the international politics and promoted Japan's expansion in South-East Asia, seeing this as a means to liberate their ethnic homelands from the Communist rule. However, Muhammed Kurbangaliev's activities came to impede Japan's coherent policy toward the Muslim communities in and outside of the country, and the country's authorities arranged for his \\"voluntary departure\\" for Dalian, Manchuria. Muhammed Kurbangaliev advocated Islam's equal positions in Japan alongside other religions. In 1939, Japan's PM Hiranuma Kiichir≈ç announced that Islam had equal rights in Japan with Buddhism and Christianity. Arrest, imprisonment, later life In 1945, when World War II ended, Muhammed Kurbangaliev was arrested by NKVD (the Soviet secret Police), condemned to 10 years‚Äô imprisonment for \\"high treason\\". Served his sentence in Vladimir Central Prison until 1955. After his release, he returned to his native region. He settled in a rural community near Chelyabinsk where he served as a Mullah until his death in 1972. See also * Islam in Japan External links * \\"The Kurbangalievs\\".

Judicial career William Thorne was appointed to the Third Circuit Court in Salt Lake City, Utah by Governor Norman Bangerter in 1986. He served as a circuit court judge until 1994 when Governor Michael Leavitt appointed him as a Third Judicial District Court Judge. Six years later, Governor Leavitt appointed him to The Utah State Court of Appeals where he has served ever since. Judge Thorne is the first Native American appointed to the Utah Bench. 2010 retention election William Thorne was certified by the Utah Judicial Council as qualified for retention election in 2010. He was retained in office receiving a favorable 77.18% of the ballots cast. Selected opinions State v. Ferretti Robert Ferretti plead guilty to murder under a plea bargain. He later wanted to withdraw his plea. He was in the time limits of the plea bargain. However, the district court did not allow him to orally withdraw the plea, or give him and his attorney time to file a written motion for withdrawal. After being heard by the Appellate Court, the decision of the lower courts was overturned, and Ferretti and his counsel were given adequate time to file a written motion for withdrawal. Kilgore v. West Jordan City, 2011 Ut. App 165 Kilgore Pavement Maintenance was hired by West Jordan City for road reconstruction. When the bid was made, liquid asphalt oil was $350 per ton. However, shortly thereafter it raised to $1,005 per ton. Kilgore filed a request with the West Jordan City Council to raise the price of the project by $91,000. This was denied by West Jordan City Council and Kilgore filed suit alleging, among other things, that the city breached its contract. The trial court dismissed th suit and Kilgore appealed. The Court of Appeals, in an opinion authored by Judge Thorne, affirmed the court ruling, stating that Kilgore had to provide materials at his own expense, and he was not allowed to increase the price based on an increase in the price of materials. LaChance v. Richman, 2011 UT App 40 The Court of Appeals, in an opinion authored by Judge Thorne, affirmed the trial court's denial of mother's claim for retroactive child support prior to the filing of a paternity action. The mother had sought an award from the father for retroactive child support dating to the time of their separation which was a few months after the birth of the minor child. The mother presented evidence to the trial court of child support worksheets and verification of income earned by the parties during the time for which she sought support. At trial, the issue of estoppel or laches was raised and the trial court was presented evidence by mother's consul that the sums sought were for reimbursement rather than child support. The trial court ruled that the mother was seeking reimbursement rather than child support and since she could not demonstrate either an agreement or unmet needs on the part of the child the trial court denied her claim. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling and refused to hear a new issue on appeal not raised in trial court. Additionally, the Court noted that the mother invited the error by agreeing she was seeking reimbursement rather than child support. Withers v. Jepsen, 2011 UT App 8 The Court of Appeals, in an opinion authored by Judge Thorne, affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgement on a partition of jointly owned real property and denial of claims for \\"owelty.\\" Two unmarried cohabitants jointly owned a home that was subject to a mortgage in both names. The woman sought to have the property sold and the man opposed. The trial court determined that because the home could not be equitably partitioned that it would be sold and the net proceeds divided equally. The man sought additional amounts for owelty which was dined by the trial court. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order that the property would be sold by recognizing that in a partition action one available remedy is the sale of the real property when physical division of the real property cannot be accomplished without great prejudice to the owners. The Court noted that the trial court determined that zoning restrictions would not allow actually partition and thus the oder for sale as appropriate.

It is home to the Marist Red Foxes baseball team of the NCAA Division I Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). The facility has a seated capacity of 350 spectators. It opened in 1992. The field's namesake is James J. McCann, a Poughkeepsie native and supporter of Marist athletics.  History  In the early 1990s, Marist trustee John J. Gartland, Jr. and the McCann Foundation worked with Marist to raise funding for a baseball facility that would allow the school to compete at the Division I level. In 1991, after funding was raised, McCann Baseball Field was built. It hosted its first game on March 29, 1992, an 8‚Äì4 Marist win over Fairleigh Dickinson. In 2005, the facility hosted the Empire State Games baseball tournament.  Features  The field's seating is located behind home plate and along the third base line. In foul territory, the field features a four-foot fence, which was installed in 2007 and allows spectators to stand along the foul lines. The outfield fences varies in height from seven to nine feet. In center field, the fence lies 414 feet from home plate, the farthest center field fence in the MAAC. The field itself is a natural turf mixture of bluegrass, rye, and fescue.

The cloud-based products allow resellers to offer online backup and recovery services to their clients with near-continuous, scheduled, or manual updates. Nine Technology pioneered use of Imation-branded RDX portable hard drives to implement cloud backup services without requiring an initial over-the-wire backup. History Nine Technology began as a subsidiary of Vault USA, an online backup managed service provider. Dissatisfied with existing software, Nine Technology‚Äôs executives began developing an entirely new system in 2006. Upon completion of the Powered By Nine product, Nine Technology sold the managed service business and began selling its own software. In December 2011, the technology that governs the Powered By Nine software was awarded a U.S. patent for its combination of block-level deduplication and encryption. Following the issuing of the patent, the technology and certain other assets were sold to Imation. Nine Technology continues to offer backup services as a partner of Imation and a stand-alone channel enabler. Headquartered in Middleboro, Massachusetts, Nine Technology currently employs 25 people and has offices in Middleboro, Guangzhou, China, and Toronto, Ontario. In December, 2011 they were acquired by Imation. In July 2012, NineTechnology sent out emails to all of their partners that they would be discontinuing all service on August 15. Accounts would not stay active, or be switched over to Imation. Products As of December 2011, Nine Technology has three products : *Powered By Nine¬Æ ONE is designed to back up individual PCs and laptops. *Powered By Nine¬Æ PRO is designed to back up servers. *Powered By Nine¬Æ Platform is the software-based product designed to allow data center managers and managed service providers to host their own back-end infrastructure. Products including local storage appliances and support for Apple and Linux operating systems are expected by the end of 2011. Technology Nine Technology was awarded a patent in December 2011 for its two-stage block-level global deduplication process, which dramatically reduces the storage space required in the infrastructure to maintain customer data. The process also reduces the amount of bandwidth required for a customer to update their files in the cloud. Following an initial ‚Äúfull‚Äù backup, customers using a Nine Technology product only send ‚Äúincremental‚Äù, or changed data to the cloud. The server architecture required to operate a Powered By Nine solution is a R.A.I.N. (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Nodes) organization. This data storage approach allows the system to expand should demand for space exceed space available. Adding load balancers to the system also makes backup and restore processes faster as the vault expands. In October 2010, Nine Technology and Imation announced a partnership that established Imation‚Äôs RDX portable hard drives as the preferred ‚Äúcloud-seeding‚Äù device of Nine Technology. This means that businesses that subscribe to the PRO service can launch their cloud storage solution by shipping RDX drives with their data to the Nine Technology data center.

It may rely on having a place of business in the jurisdiction (for legal persons), or remaining in or out of the jurisdiction for a certain number of days each year (for natural persons). Australia The \\"physical presence in Australia test\\" is one of the three tests under Australian law through which a charitable institution may be entitled to the income tax exempt charity endorsement; the others are the \\"deductible gift recipient test\\" and the \\"prescribed by law\\" test. The two elements of the test are whether the institution has a physical presence in Australia (wholly or through a division, branch, or subdivision) and whether or not the expenditures of institution are incurred principally in Australia. An institution may still qualify even if its expenditure is not incurred principally in Australia, provided that the amounts expended elsewhere are less than \\"disregarded amounts\\" (comprising gifts, proceeds from fundraising activities and government grants).http://www.ato.gov.au/nonprofit/content.aspx?menuid=0&doc;=/content/34308.htm&page;=5&H5; South Africa The South Africa Income Tax Act (No. 58 of 1962) in Section 1 defines a natural person as a \\"tax resident\\" if he is either ordinarily resident in South Africa, or meets the physical presence test. A natural person meets the physical presence test if he is present for more than 91 days during the year of assessment as well as a more than 91 days in each of the five preceding years, or if he was present for more than 915 days in aggregate in the preceding five years.http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Individuals/Learn-About- Taxes/Pages/Non-Residents.aspx However, a person who is absent from South Africa for more than 330 days following his previous day of presence will be deemed not to have been a tax resident since that day. Furthermore, a person who meets the physical presence test may still be deemed not to be a tax resident of South Africa if he is a tax resident of a country with which South Africa has a tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation.http://www.sars.gov.za/Tools/Documents/DocumentDownload.asp?FileID=65435 United States The United States uses a physical presence test both when determining eligibility of US citizens and permanent residents for favorable tax treatment for not being physically present in the US and conversely when determining when people who are not citizens or permanent residents are subject to US taxation. The former is covered in this section; the latter is covered in the article on the Substantial Presence Test. Overview One of the ways for US taxpayers to qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion is by passing the physical presence test.IRS Publication 54 (2011) IRS Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad. Meeting the test requires the taxpayer to reside in another country, living or working, for more than 329 full (24-hour) days in a 12-month period, including days spent in other foreign countries. An exception is available in the event of war or civil unrest that causes the taxpayer to leave. A less-than-24-hour visit to the US during travel between two points outside the U.S does not count as a break in a foreign stay. Determination of 12-month period Four rules determine a 12-month period for the purposes of the physical presence test:Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - Physical Presence Test # A 12-month period must be made up of consecutive months. # A 12-month period can begin on any day of any month. # The period does not begin until the first full day abroad. # The 12-month periods may overlap. A person who is present in the United States rather than abroad may still meet the physical presence test under the war and civil unrest exception. The Internal Revenue Service publishes a list of countries that qualify under the war/civil unrest exception and the respective dates during which the waiver applies. Conversely, days spent in a foreign country by a person who is present there in violation of a US ban on travel to that country do not qualify for meeting the physical presence test (or the bona fide residence test). Income earned there does not qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, and housing expenditures incurred there do not qualify for the foreign housing deduction. As of 2010, the only country in this category was Cuba (except the Guantanamo Bay corrections facility.) Foreign earned income Income earned abroad may qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, the foreign housing exclusion or deduction, as long as the income is earned in the taxpayer's tax home and the taxpayer meets either the bona fide resident test or the physical presence test.Foreign Earned Income and Housing: Exclusion ‚Äì Deduction IRS Publication 54 (2011) The income requirements for US citizens and resident aliens living abroad are the same. However, foreign earned income may qualify for some amount of exclusion. One is to subtract the amounts that are estimated from the foreign earned income exclusion. Tax obligations may be reduced by subtracting the foreign housing exclusion but only from non-excluded income by using tax rates that would apply if the income were included.

United Kingdom History Revision of the statutes was regarded by the Parliament of England as desirable as early as 1563 (see the preamble to the 5 Eliz 1 c 4). It was demanded by a petition of the Commons in 1610. Both Coke and Bacon were employed for some time on a commission for revision. Halsbury's Laws said that the first Act for statute law revision (in the sense of repealing enactments which are obsolete, spent, unnecessary or superseded, or which no longer serve a useful purpose) was the 19 & 20 Vict c 64 (1856).Halsbury's Laws of England.

Glossary. Repeal of obsolete enactments The Law Commission said that statute law revision originally referred to the repeal of enactments which had become inoperative, in order to facilitate the preparation of a revised edition of the statutes. They said that they intended to adopt a more forceful approach by also repealing enactments which no longer served a substantial purpose, and that they hoped that this would also facilitate consolidation.The Law Commission.

Uppland Runic Inscription 210 or U 210 is the Rundata catalog listing for a Viking Age memorial runic inscription which is carved on a rock-face that is located in √Östa, which is three kilometers east of Vallentuna, Stockholm County, Sweden, and in the historic province of Uppland. The inscription is signed by the runemaster √ñpir. Description The inscription on U 210 consists of runic text in the younger futhark that is carved on a serpent that makes three loops and with a cross located in the upper loop. The inscription, which measures 1.5 meters tall by 1.3 meters broad, is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. U 210 was described by one runic scholar as being a \\"good example\\" of a Pr4 style inscription. p. 123. The runic text indicates that the inscription was carved by a runemaster with a normalized name of √ñpir, who was active in Uppland in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. √ñpir was known for using loop patterns in his inscriptions, and used a three loop pattern for U 210. pp. 38-39.

Carey, wherein communication‚Äìthe construction of a symbolic reality‚Äìrepresents, maintains, adapts, and shares the beliefs of a society in time. In short, the ritual view conceives communication as a process that enables and enacts societal transformation.Carey, James W. (2009). \\"A Cultural Approach to Communication.\\" Communication as Culture. New York: Routledge. pp. 11‚Äì28. Carey defines the ritual view particularly in terms of sharing, participation, association, and fellowship.Carey 2009, p. 15 In addition, Carey acknowledges that, commonness, communion, and community, naturally correspond with the ritual view.Carey 2009, p. 18 In a similar way, the term \\"ritual\\" holds religious connotations. For Carey, this connection to religion helps to emphasize the concept of shared beliefs and ceremony that are fundamental to the ritual view. In contrast to the ritual view, James W. Carey presents what he considers the more commonly recognized transmission view of communication. In the transmission view the dissemination of information constitutes the primary goal. James W. Carey defines the transmission view in terms of imparting, sending, transmitting and giving information to others.Carey 2009, p. 12 In the transmission view information is disseminated across geography largely for the purpose of control. To support this idea, James W. Carey refers to the messaging systems of ancient Egypt wherein, \\"transportation and communication were inseparably linked\\" and served as a method of control. Where James W. Carey seemingly presents these two views as oppositional, he acknowledges that the dichotomy is false. He states, \\"neither of these counterpoised views of communication necessarily denies what the other affirms\\".Carey 2009, p. 17 Instead, they offer a nuanced perspective of communication that enables a broader understanding of human interaction. Approach to Communication In the foreword of Communication as Culture G. Stuart Adam states that, \\"Carey transferred the phenomenon of communication (and its technologies) from a place in the background of social theorizing and analysis to a place in the foreground.\\"Adam, G. Stuart (2009). \\"Foreword.\\" Communication as Culture. New York: Routledge. ix-xxiv, p. xi. Randall Rothenberg echoes this accreditation to James W.

(2003). \\"A Tetradic Analysis of GIS and Society Using McLuhan's Law of the Media.\\" Canadian Geographer 47.1: 5‚Äì17. Yet, James W. Carey himself was inspired and influenced by a number of well-known philosophers and theorists, in particular, John Dewey, Harold Innis, and Marshall McLuhan. In his essay, A Cultural Approach to Communication, James W. Carey references the writings of philosopher and psychologist John Dewey, to explore the complexities of, and draw out the contradictions for, the term \\"communication\\". James W. Carey then delineates communication into two main views, ritual and transmission. In fact, Dewey‚Äôs work informs Carey‚Äôs own use of the prepositions \\"of\\" and \\"for\\", creating distinctions in their usage.Adam 2009, p. x Moreover, Carey‚Äôs ritual and transmission view of communication, as Adam writes, draw largely from what Harold Innis implied in his work. Specifically, that media influences and contributes to the fabric of society, and its maintenance over the course of time relies on dissolution of the tensions in communication, that is its ritual and transmission forms.Adam 2009, p. xviii In A Cultural Approach to Communication, James W. Carey also references Marshall McLuhan‚Äôs assertion that, \\"the one thing of which the fish is unaware is water.\\" In so doing, James W. Carey supports the concept of \\"the symbolic production of reality\\", or what humans engage in, often unconsciously, as part of daily life, which forms the foundation for both of the ritual and the transmission views of communication. For James W. Carey, it is necessary for \\"us\\" to become aware of our symbolic reality, to better understand communication, and ultimately reshape common culture.Adam 2009, p. xiii Newspapers, social media and the ritual view In order to elaborate on his ritual view, and specifically its religious connotations, James W. Carey uses an example of mass media, the newspaper. In this case, James W. Carey likens newspaper reading to attending mass. He states, \\"attending mass, [is] a situation in which nothing new is learned but in which a particular view of the world is portrayed and confirmed.\\"Carey 2009, p. 16 The ritual act, then, becomes part of a shared culture, and according to the ritual view is maintained through time. James W. Carey details human interaction with newspapers to add another dimension to the ritual view, specifically drama. James W. Carey asserts that readers \\"engage in a continual shift of roles or of dramatic focus\\", when they read through a newspaper. Carey continues, that, \\"though news changes little‚Ä¶it is habitually consumed.\\" In this way, the ritual view of communication is concerned with the presentation of reality in a particular moment in time, and how individuals interact and share in it. Certainly newspapers have long been conceptualized in terms of community. For example, in his book Newspaper Use and Community Ties, Keith R. Stamm examines the relationship between individuals and newspapers in detail, relying on the works of Park, Jenowitz, Robert, and Merton.Stamm Keith R. (1985). Newspaper Use and Community Ties: Toward a Dynamic Theory. Norwood: Ablex Publishing Corporation. Yet, in the past few decades, newspapers, in their printed format, have experienced a steady decline in readership. In response, a large majority of newspapers now host online versions. This ongoing movement towards digital formats raises questions surrounding the changing relationship of individuals and newspapers. For instance, what becomes of the communities newspapers have long sustained? How does Carey‚Äôs ritual view of communication apply today? Although printed newspapers continue to retain readership owing, in large part, to the trustworthiness and insightfulness of content perceived by readers,Qayyum, M. Asim, et al. (2010). \\"Investigating the News Seeking Behavior of Young Adults.\\" Australian Academic & Research Libraries 41.3: 178‚Äì191. digitized newspapers surpass the printed format in terms of immediacy and geography. They also incorporate an additional dimension for connectedness, particularly through social media. Yet, the relationship between social media and newspapers is multi-layered and complex. Indeed, the relationship between the two requires further exploration in order to better understand the potential effect of social media on newspapers. However, since social media encompasses multiple platforms, it may be necessary to focus on a specific social media, for instance Twitter. In reference to Carey‚Äôs ritual view of communication Twitter enables the establishment, transformation, and maintenance of societal interaction. For example, Twitter involves both sharing and participation, by way of \\"tweets\\", and association and fellowship, by way of \\"following\\". At the same time, Twitter users engage in a somewhat ritualized way through the act of \\"following\\" particular organizations, individuals, or interests. Moreover, in \\"following\\" specific groups or persons Twitter users form \\"online communities.\\" However, the impact of Twitter on newspapers remains unclear. To what extent does Twitter work in tandem with newspapers? How does this change individuals‚Äô interaction with newspapers and their expectation of the journalists involved in newspaper production? How does Twitter transform ideas of community and enable interactions that were not possible with the printed newspaper format? The Role of Twitter Twitter describes itself as \\"‚Ä¶an information network [where] millions of people, organizations, and businesses‚Ä¶discover and share new information.\\"\\"What is Twitter?\\" Twitter.com. 10 Nov. 2011. However, Twitter is much more than an informational network, it both represents and serves contemporary communications. A consideration of the pace of our culture, the way individuals interact with each other, and with journalists on Twitter, along with the changing nature of community, provide insight into some of the questions surrounding Twitter, journalism, and the newspaper. Ultimately, the future success of the newspaper will rely on the entrenchment of Twitter, or platforms like it, within journalistic practices and newspaper production. Speed of interactions One of the key differences between newspapers of the past in contrast to today is the speed at which interactions take place. In fact, modern culture is characterized by a preoccupation with speed, or immediacy, particularly in terms of news. As one social media journalist put it, \\"Twitter has accelerated the news cycle to a point where news breaks every minute of every hour‚Ä¶\\"Ingram, Matthew (25 August 2011). \\"The Twitter Effect: We Are All Members of the Media Now.\\" Gigaom.com. Indeed, Twitter steaming occurs at a hyperactive pace. The expressions \\"fast forward\\", \\"ticking coverage\\", \\"instant access\\", and \\"real time\\", emphasize the rapidity with which Twitter operates, and correspondingly, people engage with it.Enda, Jodi (2001). \\"Campaign Coverage in the Time of Twitter: How Technology Has Transformed Reporting on Presidential Politics.\\" American Journalism Review 33.2: 15‚Äì21. So much so that the demand for instant news is now embedded in society. For example, during President Barack Obama inauguration, live online video streaming on internet news cites, saw a 200-300% increase in viewership.[Dayan and Katz ref] Yet, Twitter‚Äôs effect on the acceleration of news, and subsequently journalism and the news cycle, is nuanced. Web site Certainly, owing to the immediacy and transience of Twitter, readers appear to engage somewhat superficially. In turn, this evidences a negative effect of the technology. For instance, \\"During time-sensitive events that are global in scale like the Mumbai bombing, President Barack Obama visit to Cairo, or Air France‚Äôs plane crash near Brazil, people‚Äôs use of Twitter bursts with an astonishing frequency and intensity.\\"Yardi, Sarita; Boyd, Danah (2010). \\"Dynamic Debates: An Analysis of Group Polarization Over Time on Twitter.\\" Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society 30.5: 316‚Äì327. Yet, a large spike in interactions is soon followed by subsequent decays in tweets, evidencing how readers‚Äô attention quickly wanes. In this way engagement on Twitter appears easily abandoned or relegated, generally in favour of the next popular news item. Indeed, the restrictive format of tweets, with a limit of 140 characters, denies conversational depth. The result, therefore, is often a breakdown of conversation, whether by derogatory remarks or complete disengagement. Ultimately, the rapid interaction by users, followed by a lack thereof, or the degradation of conversation, suggests detachment on the part of users referencing a kind of superficiality of their usage. Interaction with journalists According to Twitter, over 100 million individuals worldwide use their site. Popularity alone is a good reason for newspaper journalists to engage with Twitter, gleaning a thorough and immediate account of global happenings. However, the connection that Twitter enables between journalists and their readers is equally significant. Where in the past newsreaders relied on the letter format to reach journalists, an insulated and time-intensive process, in modern day, newsreaders interaction with journalists is direct and instant. The interactions on Twitter, then, resemble more of a \\"peer-to-peer\\" relationship.Keenan, Edward; Jutras, Lisan; Vey, Kathy (17 October 2011). Discussion. The Evolving Newspaper. University of Toronto. Toronto. This allows newsreaders to provide their input direct to journalists, potentially enriching articles, inspiring article ideas, and generating a multi-faceted discussion. Of course, the platform on which Twitter operates also gives opportunities for journalists to test and explore ideas with their readers. That is, to gain feedback for an idea without investing much time or effort prior to actually developing it. Ultimately, where a direct and instant connection creates a dialogue between journalists and newsreaders a degree of trust is formed that often secures readership. Adaptation of newspaper production At the same time the dialectic between journalists and newsreaders, originating in part on Twitter, has begun to reshape the process of newspaper production. Several newspapers, in Canada and in the United Kingdom, have adopted a transparent production model, or \\"open\\" newsroom. For instance, Openfile.ca, an online Canadian newspaper with regional editions, operates with a transparency in that news, or stories in process, is made known and the journalist involved in writing a particular story is made explicit.About Openfile. Openfile.ca 2011. 10 Nov. 2011. What‚Äôs more, Openfile.ca gives credit to the individual from the community who made the recommendation for the story. In the UK, The Guardian has adopted an open newsroom in terms of allowing the participation of the public at in-house news meetings. Certainly newspapers recognize that the relationship between journalists and readers is increasingly collaborative. In turn, newspapers are exploring ways in which to adapt to accommodate this shift. Response to Web 2.0 Where Twitter enables journalists and newsreaders to connect, converse, and ideate, broadly speaking, Twitter empowers users to generate content, share, and converse with other users. The result is a proliferation of user- generated, or Web 2.0, content, with the potential effect of diminishing professional journalism. However, the proliferation of Web 2.0 content far from negates the role of journalists. Certainly, \\"‚Ä¶reporters have to know how to do a lot more, technologically speaking, than ever before‚Ä¶\\" to counterbalance user-generated content. In fact, many journalists have expanded their technological capabilities to include, for example, videographer and photographer. Yet, the saturation of an issue, by way of a multitude of tweets on Twitter, is often too much for the larger body of users to absorb, resulting in a continued reliance on journalists to wade through, decipher, and provide in-depth coverage of issue referenced on Twitter. The statement, \\"Twitter is hardly a medium for deliberative democracy\\" rings true. Twitter, then, cannot function to provide a depth of understanding, rather it relies on alternative platforms in which to unpack and contextualize pertinent issues. In this way, Twitter reaffirms the role of the journalist and the newspaper, while demonstrating the extant overlap of each. Ideas of community In \\"Communication as Culture\\", James W. Carey explains that with the dawn of the electric age the futurist ethos attributed electric technology with, among other things, the rebirth of community.Carey 2009, p. 88 Indeed, the futurist ethos was not far wrong. The advent of the Internet, a product of electric technology, has redefined community, particularly in terms of its global scale. To that end, Twitter is conceptualized as an online, global community. However, community exists only to the extent of the shared beliefs of Twitter users. That is, users are not a unified, cohesive group, rather a collective of individuals with often contrasting perspectives, seeking to find those who share their specific views. Similarly, individuals \\"hunt and gather [the news] they want when they want it,\\" often via social media, including Twitter.Garber, Megan (2009). \\"Common Knowledge: Communal News in a Fragmented World.\\" Columbia Journalism Review. pp. 1‚Äì10. An example of this is explored in \\"Dynamic Debates: An Analysis of Group Polarization Over Time on Twitter\\". The study looks at the interactions of advocates and critics of abortion on Twitter, focusing largely on the tweets occurring several hours and days following the death of late-term abortion doctor George Tiller. The study concludes that both pro-life and pro-choice supporters primarily interacted with like-minded individuals, that is, fellow supporters of either side of the abortion issue. Not only did each group seek to affirm already established beliefs, they also vehemently argued with dissidents. Although, the finding is not groundbreaking, it does demonstrate a certain loss of courtesy in the online environment. Furthermore, it shows the challenge that journalists and newspapers face in responding to the aggressive and polarized behaviour of Twitter, representative of the fracturing of community.

In this paper, Derrida questions the intentions and feasibility of Foucault's book, particularly in relation to the historical importance attributed by Foucault to the treatment of madness by Descartes in the Meditations on First Philosophy. Derrida's paper began a high-profile exchange between Derrida and Foucault as well as a considerable amount of attention from scholars.Boyne, R., 1990. Foucault and Derrida: The other side of reason. London: Unwin Hyman. p. 1. Foucault responded directly to Derrida in an appendix added to the 1972 edition of the History of Madness titled \\"My body, this paper, this fire.\\" Derrida again considered Foucault's 1961 text on madness with \\"To do Justice to Freud: The History of madness in the age of psychoanalysis\\" in 1991.

Derrida sent a letter inviting Foucault to attend this presentation.Foucault, M., 1994. Dits et √âcrits 1954‚Äì1988, vol. I: 1954‚Äì1969. Edited by D. Defert, F. Ewald, J. Lagrange. Paris: Gallimard. p. 26. The paper was subsequently published in the Revue de m√©taphysique et de morale in 1963 with the addition of a short passage inserted between brackets. Additional notes to the paper were published in the next issue of the Revue de m√©taphysique et de morale in 1964. The paper was subject to a further revision for its inclusion in the 1967 collection L'√©criture et la diff√©rence. The paper was translated into English by Alan Bass in 1978 as part of Writing and Difference. Structure of the paper Epigraphs Derrida prefaces the paper with two quotations. The first quotation is S√∏ren Kierkegaard stating that \\"The instant of decision is madness\\".Derrida, Jacques, 1978. \\"Cogito and the History of Madness\\" from Writing and Difference trans. Alan Bass. London & New York: Routledge. p. 36. Kierkegaard characterises the instant of decision as madness because it is only when one choice is not clearly superior to another when reason fails to indicate which option is better that a choice really needs to be made. The second quotation is James Joyce stating of Ulysses that \\"In any event this book was terribly daring. A transparent sheet separates it from madness.\\" Point of departure Derrida states that his point of departure for \\"Cogito and the History of Madness\\" is Foucault's 1961 book Folie et d√©raison. Derrida's paper primarily relies on two sections of Foucault's work, the original 1961 preface in which Foucault makes a number of general comments about the book, setting forth his intentions and methodology, and two and a half pages at the start of the second chapter where Foucault links Descartes to an historical event that silenced madness at the end of the classical age. Foucault's 1961 text was heavily abridged for a popular edition in 1964 that formed the basis for Richard Howard's translation of the text into English as Madness and Civilization. The abridged 1964 edition removed the pages concerning Descartes on which Derrida had explicitly based his argument in \\"Cogito and the History of Madness.\\" These pages on Descartes were only made available in English with Jean Khalfa's 2006 translation of Foucault's work on madness. Allusion to Hegel Derrida makes an allusion to the master‚Äìslave dialectic in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit in the opening pages of \\"Cogito and the History of Madness.\\" Argument concerning Descartes Foucault writes at the start of the second chapter of Madness and Civilization of a strange violent event that silenced madness at the end of the renaissance and the beginning of the classical age. He then discusses the treatment of madness by Descartes in the Meditations on First Philosophy. Foucault argues that Descartes refuses to recognise a commonality between himself and people who are mad and uses this dissociation as an excuse not to take madness seriously as a grounds for doubt. For Foucault this exclusion of madness by Descartes leads to a cogito that is more or less arbitrarily self- assured of its own rationality. Derrida argues that Descartes might appear to dismiss madness at the point of the meditation to which Foucault refers but shortly after this takes madness seriously as a ground for doubt when he considers the possibility of there being an evil demon controlling his thoughts. Derrida argues that Descartes includes the possibility of his own madness when he hypothesises that an evil demon could corrupt even the most assured and reasonable judgements he can make, such as those of basic arithmetic. Derrida argues that madness is not subject to an arbitrary exclusion by Descartes but that once Descartes earnestly but momentarily enters into the hypothesis of the evil demon he must be reassured by the ordered operative norms of his language and project of self-reflection.

However, in most outdoor environments an individual will experience terrain undulations requiring uphill running. Similar conditions can be mimicked in a controlled environment on a treadmill also. Additionally, running on inclines is used by runners, both distance and sprinter, to improve cardiovascular conditioning and lower limb strength. Gait One complete gait cycle is defined as beginning when one foot comes into contact with the ground and continuing until that same foot contacts the ground again. The gait cycle can be further broken down into a number of component parts. Running, by definition, involves a maximum of one foot in contact with the ground at any given time and often no contact with the ground. When the foot is in contact with the ground it is referred to as the ‚Äústance phase‚Äù. The ‚Äúaerial phase‚Äù is the period between contralateral foot contacts when the body is airborne. For one specific leg, the time of toe-off until subsequent heel contact is known as the ‚Äúswing-phase‚Äù for that leg. One complete gait cycle involves a stance and swing phase for each leg. Running is characterized as a ‚Äúbouncing gait‚Äù rather than the inverted pendulum mechanism of walking. The stance phase of running can be sub-divided into two parts; during the first half energy is used to perform the negative work of both slowing and lowering the center of mass. In the second half of the stance phase energy is used to perform positive work to lift and accelerate the body. Because of the synchrony of the fluctuations of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy experienced by the center of mass, mechanical work during running is performed by optimizing the combination of conserved elastic energy in tendons from lengthening and muscle contraction. Kinematics Kinematics of running is concerned with describing the motion of the body and in particular the joint angles realized at the hip, knee, and ankle. In level running the hip reaches maximal flexion prior to the end of the swing phase, followed by extension as the leg moves to meet the ground. Throughout stance phase the hip is extending until toe-off to provide propulsion. Knee joint angle displays a biphasic plot. At initial ground contact the knee flexes to lower the body followed by extending to propel the body. Maximal extension is reached at toe-off, after which the knee again flexes to provide clearance. At the ankle maximal plantarflexion is reached at toe-off and is followed by dorsiflexion until mid-swing when the ankle of dorsiflexion remains nearly constant until initial ground contact is made and further dorsiflexion occurs to lower and support the body. In the second half of the stance phase the ankle begin rapid plantar flexion until toe-off. A number of studies have been performed examining the kinematics of incline running. Swanson and Caldwell (2000) found greater joint flexion at all three joints during initial foot-strike. Also noted was an increase in extensor range of motion and angular velocity at all three joints during push off. Conversely, Klein et al. had found no changes in joint angles when running on an incline versus level surfaces. However, his subjects ran at a speed equal to anaerobic threshold (average of 3.5 meters/second) that was significantly slower than the subjects in Swanson and Caldwell‚Äôs study (4.5 meters/second). Also, grade was 5% in contrast to 30%. Stride Frequency and Length When running at a constant speed, it has been found that stride frequency increases during incline vs. level running with a concomitant decrease in stride length. At a speed of 30 meters/second Gottschall and Kram noted an increase in stride frequency from 1.45¬±0.06 Hz to 1.51¬±0.07 Hz at an incline of 9 degrees (15.8%). Telhan et al. validated this finding at a constant speed of 3.13 meters/second and a gradient of 4 degrees (6.98%) when they observed an increase in frequency from 168.5¬±8.1 steps/minute to 170.5¬±7.9 steps/minute. Both studies also saw significant decreases in stride length when running on an incline as compared to level running. The previous studies occurred at moderate speeds. When running velocity is increased 4.5 meters/second and grade increased to 30%, the same trends of increasing stride frequency and decreasing stride length are seen. Muscle Activation The quadriceps femoris muscle group and rectus femoris are both responsible for knee extension while the rectus femoris also contributes to flexion at the hip. Electromyographic (EMG) data has shown both to be active in anticipation of and during stance phase to support the body. The rectus femoris is also active in mid-swing phase as a result of its hip flexor capabilities. The major antagonist muscles to the quad set are the gluteal muscles (hip extension) and the hamstrings (hip extension and knee flexion). The hamstring muscles activate in mid-swing phase to help decelerate the lower leg. Both groups are active in late swing phase to begin to extend the hip as well as being active in the first half of the stance phase to perform the same action. Lower leg muscles acting on the ankle are the dorsiflexors (tibialis anterior) and plantarflexors (gastrocnemius and soleus). The gastrocnemius/soleus is active in the last part of swing phase to prepare for foot strike and remain active through stance until just before toe-off in order to propel the body forward. The tibialis anterior is active during swing to allow ground clearance and undergoes eccentric lengthening during stance to help control deceleration and lowering. During incline running increases in activation of the rectus femoris and gastrocnemius were noted by Cai. Yokozawa found incline running to produce increased activation in the vasti group, hamstrings, iliopsoas, and adductors. Neither of these two provided timing on what point of gait these increases occurred. Swanson also recorded EMG data, but compared differences before foot strike (swing phase) and after foot strike (stance phase) as well as on a wider range of muscles. Results showed significant increases in activation of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medial hamstring, biceps femoris, and gluteus maximus before foot strike. Following foot strike increases were seen in all muscles with the exception of the tibialis anterior and medial hamstring. Kinetics The kinetics of running, similar to the kinematics, is used to describe the motion of the body. However, in contrast to kinematics, kinetics also takes into account the relationship between motion and the forces and torques the causing it. These are expressed as joint moments and torques. Telhan et al. observed no change in the joint moments at the hip, knee, or ankle when comparing incline to level running. Also noted was the fact that both general kinetic patterns and peak magnitudes at all three joints were consistent with those in the current literature. The only significant change between the two conditions was an increase in the hip power at early stance phase. In contrast, Yokozawa saw increases in support phase knee and hip torques at the rectus femoris, hypothesizing it as a compensation mechanism for the decreased knee extension torque at the vasti set. Also seen was an increase in the net hip flexion torque during the recovery phase of incline running, allowing a quicker recovery and allowing a greater amount of hip flexion. Ground Reaction Forces Ground reaction forces (GRF) are exerted by the ground on the body in contact with it and reflect the body‚Äôs acceleration. During level running, ground reaction forces can be dichotomized into vertical ground reaction forces and horizontal ground reaction forces. In the comparison of incline to level running, the terms normal and parallel ground reaction forces are substituted for vertical and horizontal because when running on an incline the latter terms become inaccurate in describing the direction of force application. Measurements are expressed as a percentage of body weight, where a value of one body weight is the force exerted to support the body when standing. A plot of normal GRF is characterized by its biphasic nature, with an initial impact peak corresponding to the braking portion of the stance phase (heal strike) followed by a larger peak representing the propulsion part of the stance phase (toe off). Typical parallel GRF application during running involves two peaks, one that is negative during breaking and one that is positive during propulsion. Important characteristics of a GRF plot are the magnitude of the peaks (impact and active), the rate of loading, average force, and the total area under the plot. During level running at a speed of 3meters per second the vertical ground reaction force reaches a peak of approximately 2.5 times BW. Data on normal GRF during incline running has been sparse because of challenges in force platform construction. Gottschall and Kram (2004) mounted a force treadmill on wedges of varying inclines and found that compared to level running, the initial impact peak was decreased at 3, 6, and 9 degrees of inline. They also found that the braking parallel GRF was absent at 9 degrees of incline in addition to a 75% increase in the propulsive parallel GRF. Tehlan, however, did not find a blunted impact peak with incline running at 4 degrees. See also * References Farley, Claire T., and Daniel P.

L'Algonquin Gabriel Commandant, Septentrion, History Lake Blouin played a key role in the development of Val-d‚ÄôOr and the gold mines on which its economy is based. It was the main access route for prospectors and surveyors at the beginning of the 20th century. In the early 1920s, when a number of gold mines were starting up around what was to become Val-d‚ÄôOr, Lake Blouin allowed heavy equipment required for mining operations to be transported by boat from the town of Amos. A dock was built for that purpose at the south east end of the lake in 1925.http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=806882 Settlers and miners also use this route to access the area. As early as 1920, the lake was used as landing site for floatplanes providing services to the area. In 1946, a dock and fuelling station for these planes was opened on the south east shore of the lake. In 1949, a daily flight, using amphibious aircraft landing on Lake Blouin, linked Val-d‚ÄôOr to Montreal. Lake Blouin was also for a brief period used for timber rafting logs from the Val-d‚ÄôOr area to the sawmill in Amos.http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=686982 Fauna Fish species found in lake Blouin are: brown bullhead, yellow walleye, black walleye, Northern pike, Burbot, White sucker, Longnose Sucker, and Yellow perch.http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/eau/guide/resultat.asp?site=080010005 Culture Lake Blouin is featured in a popular song by Val-d‚ÄôOr native Ra√¥ul Duguay called \\"La bitt √† Tibi\\". The Rotary municipal beach on Lake Blouin is a popular summer attraction.

The SACRFB was founded in 1896. The split with the SACRFB was driven by a number of factors and people, including personality clashes between SACRFB rugby officials Cuthbert Loriston and Abdullah Abbass. Since the 1950s black, coloured and Indian sporting codes had come under increased pressure to pursue three divergent paths: form non- racial organisations, affiliate with white associations (where they would continue within their segregated leagues), or refuse to do either. From the 1960s the formation of organisations such as the South African Sports Association and the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee pressurised black sports groupings to move towards non-racial amalgamation. Danie Craven, then president of SARB, was one of the main driving forces behind the drive to affiliate coloured rugby under the SARB, believing that he could not desegregate rugby unilaterally while all other sporting codes followed the segregation policies set by the apartheid government. Loriston became the first president of the newly constituted SARFF, while the remainder of the SACRFB's clubs formed the SACOS-affiliated South African Rugby Union under leadership of Abass. SARU promoted non-racial rugby instead of the racially segregated associations that existed under SARB's organisational umbrella. It should not be confused with the body founded in 1992 that presently governs rugby in South Africa.

Founding of Community in 1889 After he rose to fame by debating with Hindu and Christian priesthood. He was revealed to take the covenant. The first one was Hakeem Noor-ud-Din who became the first Caliph of the community. On this day, 40 followers had taken the covenant. First Meal and Prayer After the taking of covenant, a meal was eaten and a prayer was held by all of the companions of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. It was the first gathering of the community. Increasing of Ahmadis Mirza Ghulam Ahmad had travelled in India and the number of Ahmadis increased. Claim and Rejection When Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to be the Promised Messiah for whom the Muslims were waiting, Maulvi Muhammad Hussein of Batala, who was his colleague was the first one to reject him. After his claim, he and his followers were the subject of the Muslim majority in India. The persecution of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community started from that day. Fatwa by Muslim Opponents Hussein indulged other clerics to prepare a fatwa against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and his followers.

The split of in 1914 The split in 1914 resulted in the formation of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, also known as Anjuman Isha\`at-e-Islam. The primary reason for the split was differences over the suitability of the elected Khalifa (2nd successor) Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad (the son of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad) and also ideological differences on key theological issues. The key ideological differences leading to the split pertained to the status of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad being a prophet or simply a mujadid, and the status of Muslims not accepting Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's claims.

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has established centres in 200 countries and states that its membership is in the tens of millions, while the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement states it is established in 17 countries of the world.

It is the first play of Bhavabhuti,Mirashi p.111 thus lacking in character and style compared to his two known later works: Malatimadhava and Uttararamacharita. Though currently composed of seven acts, the whole present text may not have been composed by Bhavabhuti. Structure and plot The play is composed of seven acts. Most modern scholars agree that Bhavabhuti has written the play from the beginning only to the 46th verse of Act V. According to one theory, the rest of the play is lost to time. Another theory suggests that Bhavabuti left the play incomplete after the 46th verse of Act V. However, two different extensions replace the lost material to make up seven acts. The North Indian version is composed by a poet Vinayaka and the South Indian version is attributed to Subrahmanya, but this is disputed. Both versions do not resemble Bhavabuti's style. However, the North Indian version is considered better in quality than the South Indian version.Mirashi p.146 Bhavabhuti's original: Act I - V.46 The prologue starts with the sutradhara (narrator) singing the prayer to God, followed by the introduction of Bhavabhuti and the themes of the play, pointing out the starting point and context of the story portrayed in Act I. In Act I, the sage Vishwamitra has called his disciples Rama and his brother Lakshmana to guard his sacrifice against demons. He has also invited King Janaka to the sacrifice site but he is unable to attend and sends his brother Kushadhvaja and daughters Sita and Urmila as his delegates.Mirashi pp.111-3 Act I begins with Vishwamitra introducing the Ayodhyan princes to Kushadhvaja, who in turn introduces his nieces to the sage. From behind the curtain, Ahalya hails Rama as her saviour and Vishwamitra tells her story to the Mithila royalty. Sita realizes that Rama is no ordinary being and develops feelings for him. Sarvamaya, a messenger of the demon king of Lanka - Ravana - demands Sita for his king. An angry Lakshamana reacts, but is pacified by Rama. Suddenly, demoness Tataka attacks the sacrifice site. Vishwamitra orders Rama to slay her, but Rama hesitates to kill a woman. The sage justifies her slaying since she otherwise would slay the priests. The powerful Tataka is killed, shocking Sarvamaya. A pleased Vishwamitra grants the princes divine weapons. Kushadhvaja wishes to have Rama as his son-in-law. Janaka imposes a condition, only the man who can string the enormous bow of the god Shiva may win the hand of Sita. So, Rama mounts the string on the bow, breaking it in the process. Kushadhvaja and Vishwamitra decide to marry Sita and Urmila to Rama and Lakshamana. Tataka's sons Maricha and Subahu attack the sacrifice site. Vishwamitra orders Rama to slay them, ending the Act.Mirashi pp.113-6 In Act II, Ravana's minister Malyavan and sister Surpanakha discuss news of Tataka and Subahu's death, Maricha's narrow escape and Rama's marriage. A letter from Parshurama arrives with a veiled threat to Ravana to stop atrocities on sages in Dandaka Forest or face the consequences. It offers friendship on condition he stops the carnage. Malyavan provokes Parshurama against Rama, who broke his guru Shiva's bow. In the main scene of the act, an enraged Parshurama arrives in Mithila and dashes into the inner chambers of Rama and Sita. Rama ‚Äî embraced by a frightened Sita ‚Äî meets Parshurama and praises him to calm the warrior-sage. While Sita is taken away, on the orders of Parshurama, Janaka and his family-priest Satananda arrive on the scene and send Rama inside. Satananda tries to pacify Parshurama and reminds him that he had broken social norms by entering the inner chambers, but Parshurama pays no heed.Mirashi pp.116-22 The sage Vashishtha, family-priest of Rama, Vishwamitra and Satananda try to calm Parshurama in Act III, with arguments including the father Dasharatha's plea, the seniority of Vashishtha to Parshurama (thus Parshurama should listen to his uncle Vashishtha), and Satananda's warning to use his penance power against his cousin Parshurama. Janaka and Dasharatha intervene and accelerate the dispute. As the scene is set for a battle between Vishwamitra and Parshurama's penance powers, Rama enters and humbly praises Parshurama, who prepares to fight him.Mirashi pp.122-9 In Act IV, Malyavan and Surpanakha visit Mithila in a flying machine and learn of Parshurama's defeat. Malyavan orders Surpanakha to possess the body of Manthara, Rama's stepmother queen Kaikeyi's maid. He plots to bring Rama to the Dandaka Forest where Ravana's demons and monkey ally Vali would get rid of him. Sita could then be easily acquired for Ravana and his brother Vibhishana would not be able to interfere. If he sides with Rama, the plan will fail and Lanka will be doomed, warns Malyavan. In the main scene, the defeated Parshurama politely talks to the sages and kings, with whom he quarrelled in the last Act and is forgiven for his transgressions. The sages bless Rama and Sita and leave. Parshurama gives away his weapons and requests Rama to protect the sages of Dandaka Forest. The possessed Manthara brings a false letter from Kaikeyi which instructs Dasharatha to send Rama to the forest for a 14-year exile and crown her son Bharata as king. Listening to this wish, Dasharatha faints. Bharata agrees to rule the kingdom till Rama returns and takes Rama's sandals as his reminder. The sorrow of Ayodhya is then described. Rama with Sita and Lakshmana leave for the forest and set up camp in Chitrakuta, where demon Viradha is troubling the people.Mirashi pp.129-37 Act V starts with a short story about Surpanakha lusting for Rama and Lakshmana cutting her nose, when they moved to Panchavati. Demons Khara, Dushana and Trisiras attack in vindication and are killed. The vulture Jatayu sees Rama and Lakshmana chasing a deer, while Ravana kidnaps Sita. Jatayu dies trying to protect Sita. In his last words, he reveals Sita's captor to Rama. As they move forward, they hear the distress call of Shramana. Lakshmana kills demon Kabandha and frees Shramana, the envoy who has joined forces with Vali's brother Sugriva. Malyavan instigates Vali to attack the grief-stricken Rama. Vali confronts Rama, and this is where Bhavabhuti's Act V ends.Mirashi pp.137-42 North Indian manuscript Act V continues with a fair duel between Vali and Rama. Rama slays Vali, who in his dying breath asks Rama for forgiveness and advises him to form an alliance with Sugriva and Vibhishana.Mirashi pp.142-4 Act VI begins with a disappointed Malyavan learning that his plans have failed, Lanka is set on fire by Rama's monkey general Hanuman and Ravana's obsession with Sita and his wife Mandodari's plea to return Sita. In the main scene, Mandodari tells Ravana about a bridge of flowing rocks to by built by the monkeys. Rama's monkey envoy Angada arrives, but his peace deal is rejected. Battle preparations start. The god Indra and the gandharva Chitraratha come to witness the epic war. The whole war is presented as a dialogue between them. Finally, Rama slays Ravana. Act VII starts with the presiding deities of the cities Lanka and Alaka discussing Sita's trial by fire, Vibhishana's coronation and Rama's preparations to return home. Rama and his party return to Ayodhya in Ravana's flying machine, describing the places they see below them. Hanuman flies ahead to convey the message of Rama's arrival to Bharata. A welcome party greets Rama and the play ends with Rama's coronation. South Indian manuscript Act V continues with Vali and Rama agreeing to fight.Mirashi pp.144-6 In Act VI, Rama kills a deer, not knowing it is Vali, cursed by a sage and turned into a deer. Sage Agastya gives Rama divine vision so that he can see the evil designs of Malyavan and Ravana. Act VII starts with a conversation between Indra and Dasharatha, who arrive from heaven in Ayodhya in a flying machine. They discuss Ravana's defeat, Vibhishana's coronation, Sita's fire ordeal and Rama's arrival in Ayodhya. The gods and sages bless the crowned Rama and Sita, ending the play. Themes Though Bhavabhuti's inspiration is the Ramayana, the earliest narrative of Rama's life; he has deviated with the Ramayana plot at many places, like love feelings in Sita's heart, Kaikeyi absolved of all guilt, Surpanakha possessing Manthara and Rama killing Vali in a fair battle. Bhavabhuti has even quoted some Ramayana verses verbatim. A unique feature of the play is the plotting of Malyavan.Mirashi pp. 146-8 While Ramayana is clear that Rama kills Vali justly from a hidden spot while Vali and Sugriva are in a duel, Bhavabhuti portrays Vali allying with the villain Ravana and killed in a fair battle, thus legitimatising the death of Vali at the hands of Rama. The most prominent rasa is Vira or heroism, expressed in Rama's valorous speech. Other rasas include Raudra (anger), in Parshurama's speech and Bibhasta (disgust) in grotesque descriptions of demons and their corpses. Bhavabhuti uses 20 poetic metres in the 200 verses of the play.Mirashi p. 151 Much about Bhavabhuti's life is known from the information given by him in the prologue of this play. Assessment Two of the acts are devoted to a confrontation between Rama and Parashurama. This overstretched dialogue is considered as a sign of the immaturity of Bhavabhuti at this period. The play is also criticized as a listing of events rather than a coherent composition. Bhavabuti is praised for his characterization of the various epic personalities and his innovative remodeling of the story, inducing various new themes and events. Bhavabuti's analysis of politics and his handling of the Manthara, Surpanakha, and Parshurama episodes with Malyavan's devious background politics is commended.

The probability of being selected for an individual is proportional to the cumulative reward, obtained by the individual. The cumulative reward can be computed as a sum of the individual reward and the reward, inherited from parents. Description Reward-based selection can be used within Multi-armed bandit framework for Multi-objective optimization to obtain a better approximation of the Pareto front. The newborn a'^{(g+1)} and its parents receive a reward r^{(g)}, if a'^{(g+1)} was selected for new population Q^{(g+1)}, otherwise the reward is zero. Several reward definitions are possible: *1. r^{(g)}=1, if the newborn individual a'^{(g+1)} was selected for new population Q^{(g+1)}. *2. r^{(g)} = 1 - \\\\frac{rank(a'^{(g+1)})}{\\\\mu} \\\\mbox{ if } a'^{(g+1)} \\\\in Q^{(g+1)} , where rank(a'^{(g+1)}) is the rank of newly inserted individual in the population of \\\\mu individuals.

The New Zealand government commissioned him in 1884 to compile a report on the indigenous forests of the country and appointed him as chief conservator of forests the following year. He published 130 papers in botany and plants including The Durability of New Zealand Timbers, The Forest Flora of New Zealand and Students' Flora of New Zealand. Early life and career Thomas was the son of a Coventry nurseryman, George Kirk, and Sarah West, a florist. As a consequence of his parents' involvement in nursery work, he displayed a keen interest in botany, and later worked at a timber mill in Coventry. In 1850 he married a silk marker, Sarah Jane Mattocks. Poor health and financial problems led to his emigrating to Auckland, arriving with his family on 9 February 1863. Soon after his arrival Kirk started on a collection of botanical specimens. He prepared a set of ferns and other plants for the New Zealand Exhibition which was held in Dunedin in January 1865. In the following year he worked as surveyor, and in 1868 became a meteorological observer in Auckland. In the same year he was appointed secretary of the Auckland Institute and took on the position of museum curator, an office he filled for the next five years. Kirk took part in a number of botanical expeditions, writing and publishing reports on the results. These included Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands in 1867, the east coast of Northland in 1868, the Thames goldfields in 1869, the Waikato district in 1870, and Rotorua and Taupo in 1872. Between 1869 and 1873 he found time to serve as secretary and treasurer of the Auckland Acclimatisation Society, teaching botany at the Auckland College and Grammar School and became an elected fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1871. In early 1874 he moved to Wellington and until 1880 lectured there in natural sciences at Wellington College, which was then affiliated to the University of New Zealand. Kirk proved to be a skilled teacher, enjoying the respect of staff and students. In 1874 he became a member of the Wellington Philosophical Society, serving as president in 1878 and 1879. He was appointed lecturer in natural science at Lincoln School of Agriculture, in Canterbury in 1881, and stayed until 1882, returning in 1883 and 1884. During this period he botanised in Arthur's Pass, Banks Peninsula, Lake Wakatipu and Stewart Island. Botanical expeditions \\"Felling Matai (Prumnopitys taxifolia) and Red Wood (Sequoia sempervirens) in Seaward Forest\\" The New Zealand government commissioned him in 1884 to compile a report on the indigenous forests of the country and appointed him as chief conservator of forests the following year. Although not trained as a forester, he was in favour of sound forest conservation. He founded the forest and agriculture branch of the Crown Lands Department, implemented regulations to curb the misuse of forests, and was instrumental in setting aside some 800 000 acres as forest reserves by 1888. Kirk was recalled in 1889 from retrenchment to work on the Forest flora of New Zealand, but died in the midst of this great work. At the time it was hoped that the work could be published under the supervision of his son, H. B. Kirk. Retrenchment did not dampen Kirk's botanical enthusiasm. He explored The Snares, Auckland Island, Campbell Island and Antipodes Islands and Stewart Island in 1890, and in later years the headwaters of the Turakina and Rangitikei Rivers. Sarah Jane Kirk in 1895 Kirk died in straitened circumstances and was buried in an unmarked grave in Karori Cemetery in Wellington. He was survived by his wife, Sarah, and five of his nine children. His daughter Cybele Ethel Kirk worked with unmarried and abandoned women whist another daughter Lily May Atkinson, was a well-known suffragette and temperance campaigner. Despite appeals, his widow was denied any compassionate grant from the Government. Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker wrote of Kirk's death: ‚ÄúThis is a great loss to Botany, for indeed except the late Baron von Mueller there was no other cultivator of Botany in the Southern Hemisphere who could compare with him and I have been looking for years for the Forest Flora of New Zealand by him as to a work of very great scientific importance\\". Kirk wrote some 130 papers on botany and plants, published in New Zealand and British journals. In 1875 his report on The Durability of New Zealand Timbers appeared, then The Forest Flora of New Zealand in 1889, followed by Students' Flora of New Zealand, published after his death in 1898. The Forest Flora of New Zealand was described by printer and journalist Robert Coupland Harding as: Agathis australis by John Hugh Boscawen (1851‚Äì1937) Thomas Kirk did not produce any of the illustrations for The Forest Flora of New Zealand, though they were carried out under his supervision. Drawings were done by draughtsmen of the Survey Department, while a Mr D. Blair and Mr A. Hamilton contributed at least twenty-six of the plates. Two staff members of the Survey Department, Hugh McKean and Hugh Boscawen, each contributed thirty-eight signed plates. Other artists were E. J. Graham (twenty-nine plates) and W. de R. Barclay (one plate). A close scrutiny of the twenty unsigned plates suggests they were the work of Boscawen or Hamilton. Bibliography * Brown, L. The forestry era of Professor Thomas Kirk.

It was the final film directed by Hanson before his death in 2016. Plot In 1987, an 8-year-old boy in Santa Cruz, California named Jay Moriarity is saved from drowning by his next door neighbor, surfer Frosty Hesson (Gerard Butler). This ignites his passion for the sport. One morning, Jay (Jonny Weston), now 15, sees Frosty leaving early and hitches a ride on his van. He sees Frosty and three of his friends riding a gigantic swell known as Mavericks, which with El Ni√±o coming in will be at its height in three months' time. Reluctantly, Frosty agrees to teach Jay how to surf Mavericks, but insists that Jay learn about the \\"foundation pillars of surfing\\". These involve him learning to paddle board 36 miles across Monterey Bay (from Santa Cruz to Monterey), treading water for 40 minutes and being able to hold his breath for four minutes. While training, Frosty encourages Jay to write essays to focus on the task. His first essay is about Kim (Leven Rambin), his crush, whose dog he saved when he was 8, which caused him to nearly drown. Jay gets closer to Kim as he trains, partially encouraged by Frosty's wife, Brenda (Abigail Spencer). A few weeks before the biggest swell of the season hits Mavericks, Brenda has a stroke and dies. A few days later, distraught from Brenda's death, Frosty paddles out into the bay. Jay follows him, and using the knowledge from his training, he helps Frosty back to shore. Frosty realizes that Jay is ready to ride Mavericks. Frosty takes Jay to Mavericks at Half Moon Bay and watches with his three friends as Jay treads water against the tide. The group agrees that Jay is ready to ride with them. For Jay's 16th birthday on June 15, 1994, his mother (Elisabeth Shue) gives him a radio so he can listen to the weather broadcasts and track the swell. Frosty gives him a custom-made \\"big wave gun\\" (a long surfboard especially designed for riding big waves). Kim reveals her feelings for him and they share a kiss. Frosty had wanted to keep Mavericks a secret, but Jay's notebook that he had been using for preparation ends up in the hands of his rival Sonny (Taylor Handley). When Jay and Frosty go to Half Moon Bay, there is a large crowd and boats taking surfers out. Many of the newcomers wipe out before getting to surf Mavericks. Jay wipes out at first, but then retrieves his board and successfully rides Mavericks. A title card reveals that he married Kim and died at age 22 while free-diving in the Maldives. The film ends with Frosty, Kim, and an assemblage of others holding a surfers' memorial service for Jay.

On December 19, Gerard Butler was hospitalised briefly after being injured during a surfing stunt. Gerard Butler was mentored by big-wave surfer Grant Washburn. Michael Apted received second-position director credit for this film because he took over as director during the last 15 days of principal photography, while Curtis Hanson recovered from complications arising from recent heart surgery. Soundtrack ;Other songs used in the film * The Offspring ‚Äì \\"Come Out and Play\\" * Jules Larson ‚Äì \\"Honey Baby\\" Reception The film has received mixed reviews from critics. It received a score of 45 out 100 from Metacritic based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 32% based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 4.86/10. The site's consensus states: \\"It's sweet, gentle, and affably modest, but Chasing Mavericks is ultimately pulled under by an unconvincing script and a puzzling lack of energy.\\" Roger Ebert praised the film, saying that \\"Chasing Mavericks is made with more care and intelligence than many another film starting with its template might have been. It's better than most movies targeted at teens. And the cinematography of the big Mavericks scene by Oliver Euclid and Bill Pope is so frightening that you sort of understand why Frosty stays on the shore, watching Jay with binoculars.\\" Home media Chasing Mavericks was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on February 26, 2013. Book In October 2012, Frosty Hesson published Making Mavericks with Zola Books. The book is a memoir filled with Hesson's life- affirming lessons and described his experience mentoring Jay Moriarity.

Moose* and Rita H. Mumm (2008) Molecular Plant Breeding as the Foundation for 21st Century Crop Improvement, Plant Physiology 147:969-977 and animal breeding. In Broad sense, Molecular breeding can be defined as the use of genetic manipulation performed at DNA levels to improve traits of interest in plants and animals, and it may also include genetic engineering or gene manipulation, molecular marker- assisted selection, and genomic selection. But more often, however, molecular breeding implies molecular marker-assisted breeding (MAB) and is defined as the application of molecular biotechnologies, specifically molecular markers, in combination with linkage maps and genomics, to alter and improve plant or animal traits on the basis of genotypic assays. The areas of molecular breeding include: * QTL mapping or gene discovery * Marker assisted selection and genomic selection * Genetic engineering * Genetic transformation  Aspects of Molecular Breeding   Marker assisted breeding  ; Genotyping and creating molecular maps - genomics : The commonly used markers include Simple sequence repeats (or microsatellites), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The process of identification of plant genotypes is known as genotyping. Development of SNPs has revolutionized the molecular breeding process as it helps to create dense markers. Another area that is developing is genotyping by sequencing. ; Phenotyping - phenomics : To identify genes associated with traits, it is important to measure the trait value - known as phenotype. \\"omics\\" for measurement of phenotypes is called phenomics. The phenotype can be indicative of the measurement of the trait itself or an indirectly related or correlated trait. ; QTL mapping or association mapping : Genes (Quantitative trait loci (abbreviated as QTL) or quantitative trait genes or minor genes or major genes) involved in controlling trait of interest is identified. The process is known as mapping. Mapping of such genes can be done using molecular markers. QTL mapping can involve single large family, unrelated individuals or multiple families (see: Family based QTL mapping). The basic idea is to identify genes or markers associated with genes that correlate to a phenotypic measurement and that can be used in marker assisted breeding / selection ; Marker assisted selection or genetic selection : Once genes or markers are identified, they can be used for genotyping and selection decisions can be made. ; Marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) : Backcross is crossing F1 with its parents to transfer a limited number of loci (e.g. transgene, disease resistance loci, etc.) from one genetic background to another. Usually the recipient of such genes is good adapted cultivars otherwise except the gene that is to be transferred. So we want to keep genetic background of the recipient genotypes, which is done by 4-6 rounds of repeated backcrosses while selecting for the gene of interest. We can use markers from the whole genome to recover the genome quickly in 2-3 rounds of backcrossing might be good enough in such situation. ; Marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) : MARS include identification and selection of several genomic regions (up to 20 or even more) for complex traits within a single population. ; Genomic selection : Genomic selection is novel approach to traditional marker-assisted selection where selection are made based on few markers. Rather than seeking to identify individual loci significantly associated with a trait, genomics uses all marker data as predictors of performance and consequently delivers more accurate predictions. Selection can be based on genomic selection predictions, potentially leading to more rapid and lower cost gains from breeding. Genomic prediction combines marker data with phenotypic and pedigree data (when available) in an attempt to increase the accuracy of the prediction of breeding and genotypic values.  Genetic transformation or Genetic engineering  Transfer of genes make it possible for horizontal transfer of genes from one organism to another. Thus plants can receive genes from humans or algae or any other organism. This provides limitless opportunity in breeding crop plants.

It signals the point where actions of the user take place. It can be used in text-based or graphical user interfaces to select and move other elements. It is distinct from the cursor, which responds to keyboard input. The cursor may also be repositioned using the pointer. The pointer commonly appears as an angled arrow (angled because historically that improved appearance on low resolution screens), but it can vary within different programs or operating systems. The use of a pointer is employed when the input method, or pointing device, is a device that can move fluidly across a screen and select or highlight objects on the screen. In GUIs where the input method relies on hard keys, such as the five-way key on many mobile phones, there is no pointer employed, and instead the GUI relies on a clear focus state.  Appearance  A wait cursor replaces the pointer with an hourglass. The pointer hotspot is the active pixel of the pointer, used to target a click or drag. The hotspot is normally along the pointer edges or in its center, though it may reside at any location in the pointer. In many GUIs, moving the pointer around the screen may reveal other screen hotspots as the pointer changes shape depending on the circumstances. For example: * In text that the user can select or edit, the pointer changes to a vertical bar with little cross-bars (or curved serif- like extensions) at the top and bottom -- sometimes called an \\"I-beam\\" since it resembles the cross-section of the construction detail of the same name. * When displaying a document, the pointer can appear as a hand with all fingers extended allowing scrolling by \\"pushing\\" the displayed page around. * Graphics-editing pointers such as brushes, pencils or paint buckets may display when the user edits an image. * On an edge or corner of a window the pointer usually changes into a double arrow (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) indicating that the user can drag the edge/corner in an indicated direction in order to adjust the size and shape of the window. * The corners and edges of the whole screen may also act as hotspots. According to Fitts's law, which predicts the time it takes to reach a target area, moving mouse and stylus pointers to those spots is easy and fast. As the pointer usually stops when reaching a screen edge, the size of those spots can be considered of virtual infinite size, so the hot corners and edges can be reached quickly by throwing the pointer toward the edges. * While a computer process is performing tasks and cannot accept user input, a wait pointer (an hourglass in Windows before Vista and many other systems, spinning ring in Windows Vista and later, watch in classic Mac OS, or spinning pinwheel in macOS) is displayed when the mouse pointer is in the corresponding window. * When the pointer hovers over a hyperlink, a mouseover event changes the pointer into a hand with an outstretched index finger. Often some informative text about the link may pop up in a tooltip, which disappears when the user moves the pointer away. The tooltips revealed in the box depend on the implementation of the web browser; many web browsers will display the \\"title\\" of the element, the \\"alt\\" attribute, or the non-standard \\"tooltips\\" attribute. This pointer shape was first used for hyperlinks in Apple Computer's HyperCard. * In Windows 7, when Windows Touch was introduced in the mainstream to make Windows more touch friendly, a touch pointer is displayed instead of the mouse pointer. The touch pointer can be switched off in Control Panel and resembles a small diamond shape. When the screen is touched a blue ripple appears around the touch pointer to provide visual touch feedback. When swiping to scroll etc., the touch pointer would follow the finger as it moves. If touch and hold to right click is enabled, touching and holding will show a thick white ring around the touch pointer. When this ring appears, releasing one's finger would perform a right click. ** If a pen is used the left-click ripple is colourless instead of blue and the right-click ring is a thinner ring which appears closer to the pen tip making contact with the screen. A click (either left or right) will not show the touch pointer, but swiping would still show the pointer which would follow the pen tip. ** Also, the touch pointer would only appear on the desktop once a user has signed in to Windows 7. On the sign in screen the mouse cursor would simply jump to the point which is touched and a left click would be sent on a tap, similarly to when touch input is used on operating systems prior to Windows 7. * In Windows 8 and above, visual touch feedback displays a translucent circle where the finger makes contact with the screen, and a square when attempting to touch and hold to right-click. A swipe is shown by a translucent line of varying thickness. Feedback can be switched on and off in Pen and Touch settings of the Control Panel in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 or in the Settings app on Windows 10, and feedback can also be made darker and larger where it needs to be emphasised, such as when presenting. However, the touch pointer is normally less commonly visible in touchscreen environments of Windows operating systems later than Windows 7. * The mouse-over or hover gesture can also show a tooltip, which presents information about what the pointer is hovering over; the information is a description of what selecting an active element is for or what it will do. The tooltip appears only when stationary over content. A common use of viewing the information is when browsing the internet to know the destination of a link before selecting it, if the URL of the text is not recognisable. ** When using touch or a pen with Windows, hovering when supported or performing a set gesture or flick may show the tooltip  Pointer trails and animation  An example of mouse pointer trails. ' can be used to enhance its visibility during movement. Pointer trails are a feature of GUI operating systems to enhance the visibility of the pointer. Although disabled by default, pointer trails have been an option in every version of Microsoft Windows since Windows 3.1x. When pointer trails are active and the mouse or stylus is moved, the system waits a moment before removing the pointer image from the old location on the screen. A copy of the pointer persists at every point that the pointer has visited in that moment, resulting in a snake-like trail of pointer icons that follow the actual pointer. When the user stops moving the mouse or removes the stylus from the screen, the trails disappear and the pointer returns to normal. Pointer trails have been provided as a feature mainly for users with poor vision and for screens where low visibility may become an issue, such as LCD screens in bright sunlight. In Windows, pointer trails may be enabled in the Control Panel, usually under the Mouse applet. Introduced with Windows NT, an animated pointer was a small looping animation that was played at the location of the pointer. This is used, for example, to provide a visual cue that the computer is busy with a task. After their introduction, many animated pointers became available for download from third party suppliers. Unfortunately, animated pointers are not without their problems. In addition to imposing a small additional load on the CPU, the animated pointer routines did introduce a security vulnerability. A client-side exploit known as the Windows Animated Cursor Remote Code Execution Vulnerability used a buffer overflow vulnerability to load malicious code via the animated cursor load routine of Windows. Editor A pointer editor is software for creating and editing static or animated mouse pointers. Pointer editors usually support both static and animated mouse cursors, but there are exceptions. An animated cursor is a sequence of static cursors representing individual frames of an animation. A pointer editor should be able to: * Modify pixels of a static cursor or of each individual frame in an animated cursor. * Set the hot spot of a static cursor or of a frame of an animated cursor. The hot spot is a designated pixel that defines the clicking point. * Add or remove frames in an animated cursor and set their animation speed. Pointer editors are occasionally combined with icon editors, because computer icons and cursors share similar properties. Both contain small raster images and the file format used to store icons and static cursors in Microsoft Windows is similar. Despite the similarities, pointer editors differ from icon editors in a number of ways. While icons contain multiple images with different sizes and color depths, static cursors (for Windows) only contain a single image. Pointer editors must provide means to set the hot spot.

They were released as bonus features in the Complete Sixth Series DVD and Blu-ray box sets in November 2011. The first four are narratively linked, centering on the question, \\"What does the Doctor do at night when his companions are asleep?\\" and take place in the console room of the TARDIS. The fifth one precedes the events of the episode \\"Closing Time\\", possibly a prequel or deleted scene, though this remains unconfirmed by the BBC. No cast or crew were credited for any of the five episodes except for writer Steven Moffat. Episodes \\"Bad Night\\" When Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) answers the TARDIS telephone in the middle of the night, she learns the Doctor carries on a very active social and adventuring life while his companions sleep. The Doctor (Matt Smith) then enters the TARDIS carrying a goldfish, whom he claims is actually a British Queen. Amy tries to piece together how the fate of the Commonwealth could possibly be affected by the Doctor, an unseen River Song, an unnamed Prince of Wales and the goldfish. She wants to have a serious conversation with the Doctor about her uneasy sleep, but the Doctor calls for her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) to come deal with her emotions when he realises that he picked up the wrong goldfish. \\"Good Night\\" The Doctor returns from another night out with River Song. Amy, wide awake and sitting in her nightie on the stairs, catches him. She convinces him to tell her what he does while he's out at night, then tells him why she is finding it hard to sleep lately because her life doesn't make any sense. Due to the events of \\"The Big Bang\\", she can remember two versions of her life, one without her parents and one with. The Doctor comforts her and reminds her of the saddest moment of her life. It was at a fair when she dropped an ice cream. While recalling the event, she suddenly remembers a woman with red hair, dressed in a nightie, who gave her a new ice cream. When she finishes the anecdote, the Doctor is by the doors, ready to go with her to the fair. \\"First Night\\" River Song (Alex Kingston) is incarcerated in her cell on the first night after apparently killing the Doctor (\\"The Wedding of River Song\\") when she hears the TARDIS. The Doctor informs her that her parents, Amy and Rory, are asleep and he is taking her out to Calderon Beta where he intends to show her the sky on the starriest night in the entire history of the universe. The Doctor also tells her that she will easily be able to break out of the prison whenever she wishes, and explains that the diary he gave her in \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" is to help keep track of their encounters. He shows her a dress he has chosen, but says there are more in the wardrobe down the corridor if she wants another. She hurries off to look while he pilots the TARDIS to their destination. While River is still in the wardrobe, the Doctor lands the TARDIS and hears laser-gunfire outside. He opens the door as a second River enters and collapses into his arms. \\"Last Night\\" Right before attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation, the Doctor finds that River is merely holding her breath, and had been chased by Sontarans. As he chastises her, she notices the gold dress he chose for their first visit to Caldoron Beta five years before, hanging near the console. She demands to know who he's brought, and storms up the stairs to find the hussy. A second later, the earlier River returns from the TARDIS wardrobe, demanding to know who he's talking to. She returns to the wardrobe. The older River returns, demanding to know to whom the Doctor is speaking. When he denies talking to anyone, she resumes her hunt. A third River enters the TARDIS, actually wearing the gold dress. This version of River was expecting to meet the Doctor here, but on seeing an identical gold dress hung by the console, asks why he has bought another. The Doctor asks her to step outside to check if the light on top of the TARDIS is working. The youngest River reappears, certain she has heard voices. The Doctor tells her he was talking to himself and she bustles off again. The second River returns to the control room, likewise convinced she heard the Doctor talking to someone. The Doctor brusquely activates her Vortex manipulator to send her back to prison. The third River re-enters the TARDIS, followed by a second, older version of the Eleventh Doctor, who informs her that she is in the wrong TARDIS. As they are about to leave, she asks the younger Doctor if they are off to see the Singing Towers of Darillium. The two Doctors share a brief, sad moment, knowing such a trip would possibly be the most advanced (in total age) Doctor she would see before she dies in the Library (\\"Forest of the Dead\\") in the Tenth Doctor's presence. As the older Doctor leaves, the youngest River returns to catch a glimpse of the Doctors together. She asks the younger Doctor about it but he refuses to tell her, using River's catchphrase, \\"Spoilers\\". River jokes that his secrets will be the death of her and walks past him. The Doctor pauses to have another sad moment before taking the youngest River on their date. \\"Up All Night\\" This episode takes place prior to \\"Closing Time\\" by Gareth Roberts and shows the night spent by Craig Owens (James Corden) before the Doctor pays him a visit. Craig faces his fears of being a father and caring for young Alfie, while Sophie (Daisy Haggard) prepares for her trip and the lights flicker ominously. Production The first two episodes, \\"Good Night\\" and \\"Bad Night\\", were filmed over two days alongside the 2011 Comic Relief charity special \\"Space\\" and \\"Time\\", and continue the narrative of Amy trying to talk to the Doctor. This also ties thematically with what happens to Amy during the fifth series and what is happening to her in the sixth series. For \\"Good Night\\", two \\"goldfish wranglers\\" were hired to take care of the goldfish. Release and reception Night and the Doctor was released on the Complete Sixth Series DVD or Blu-ray set, released in the Region 2 on 21 November 2012 and in Region 1 on 22 November. In total they are about fourteen minutes long; \\"Good Night\\" is the longest at nearly five minutes, and \\"Up All Night\\" is the shortest at two minutes. Ian Berriman of SFX called the serial the \\"most exciting bonus\\". He referred to \\"Bad Night\\" as being an \\"inconsequential fare, but good fun\\", and said that \\"Good Night\\" was his favorite. However, Berriman wrote that \\"Up All Night\\" was \\"pointless\\" after watching \\"Closing Time\\". Charlie Jane Anders of io9 thought that the mini-episodes embodied \\"why we love Steven Moffat's clever-pants dialogue and rapid-fire storytelling\\". Anders also wrote that \\"Good Night\\" added \\"some much-needed character development for Amy\\" and that \\"First Night\\"/\\"Last Night\\" had \\"some absolutely lovely River Song moments\\". DVD Talk's John Sinnott named Night and the Doctor as his favourite extra on the DVDs, describing them as \\"clever and funny and a very welcome addition to the set\\". Teresa Jusino of Tor.com described the mini-episode as \\"a beautiful addition to Doctor Who canon\\" because they stripped the typical adventures to show that the programme was \\"a beautiful show about people and ideas\\". She called \\"Bad Night\\" the \\"funniest\\" and \\"Good Night\\" the \\"best\\". IGN reviewer Arnold T Blumburg called \\"Bad Night\\" \\"frivolous fluff\\" and \\"Up All Night\\" a \\"cute prequel\\". He felt that \\"Good Night\\" and \\"First Night\\"/\\"Last Night\\" had more emotion and \\"more information and logic than any of the aired episodes\\", although he noted that the latter had \\"a disproportionately large if predictable helping of juvenile sexual innuendo\\".

It was built in 1826, and is a 2 1/2-story, frame building on a stone foundation. It has a gable roof with decorative bargeboard. It has an 11 feet in diameter, 4 feet wide, steel water wheel to run the machinery. Note: This includes The mill was given to York County by its owner in 1979.York County Parks, Wallace-Cross Mill Historic Site It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History The mill was constructed in 1826 and was operated continuously until the 1980s taking its water power from Rambo Run. The mill now a part of the York County Parks system was placed on the Pennsylvania Inventory of Historic Places on February 24, 1977 and the National Register of Historic Places on June 10, 1977. The owner Harry Cross gave the mill to the County of York in 1979. A major renovation of the building, both inside and out, was undertaken by York County Parks in the early 2000s. Since 1840, ownership of the mill changed only four times with one name change from the family name of Wallace to Cross. The restoration focus is the 1950 era; the pinnacle of Harry Cross' career when the mill ran 24 hours a day and seven days a week. All three floors of the mill are open to the public with milling displays and equipment. The exhibits and demonstrations appeal to all ages but especially fifth through seventh grade students of Pennsylvania history. Milling equipment includes a Lieberknecht mill and a hand-powered corn sheller. Also, there is a display on how millstones function and are sharpen. A family-tree display of the Wallace and Cross family can be found in the office. The first floor office where Harry Cross conducted his business gives the impression that he stepped out for a moment. It includes a stove, miller's desk, work bench and chairs. The mill was originally powered by a wooden overshot wheel with wooden spokes and shaft. In 1922, the wooden wheel was replaced by a steel Fitz wheel, manufactured in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Fitz was the preeminent manufacturer of mill wheels in the 19th century. The original Fitz waterwheel was restored and re-installed through the kindness of Harvey Bradley. Since 2003, the mill has been operated by the Friends of Wallace-Cross Mill. This dedicated group of volunteers host open houses June through October and conducts special tours.

It is part of the Gregory Rift, the eastern branch of the East African Rift, which starts in Tanzania to the south and continues northward into Ethiopia. It was formed on the \\"Kenyan Dome\\" a geographical upwelling created by the interactions of three major tectonics: the Arabian, Nubian, and Somalian plates. In the past, it was seen as part of a \\"Great Rift Valley\\" that ran from Madagascar to Syria. Most of the valley falls within the former Rift Valley Province. The valley contains the Cherangani Hills and a chain of volcanoes, some of which are still active. The climate is mild, with temperatures usually below . Most rain falls during the March‚ÄìJune and October‚ÄìNovember periods. The Tugen Hills to the west of Lake Baringo contain fossils preserved in lava flows from the period 14 to 4 million years ago. The relics of many hominids, ancestors of humans, have been found here.  Features  Main volcanoes and lakes in the rift valley The valley is bordered by escarpments to the east and west. The floor is broken by volcanoes, some still active, and contains a series of lakes. Some of the soils are Andisols, fertile soils from relatively recent volcanic activity. Lake Turkana occupies the northern end of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya. There are also volcanoes in Lake Turkana. The Suguta Valley, or Suguta Mud Flats, is an arid part of the Great Rift Valley directly south of Lake Turkana. The shield volcano Emuruangogolak straddles the valley to the south of Suguta, and further south Mount Silali and Paka rise from the valley floor. Paka is a shield volcano, with widespread geothermal activity. South of Paka are Mount Korosi, Lake Baringo and Lake Bogoria. Menengai is a massive shield volcano in the floor of the rift with a caldera that formed about 8,000 years ago. It overlooks Lake Nakuru to the south. This region also includes Lake Elementaita, Mount Kipipiri and Lake Naivasha. The Hell's Gate National Park lies south of Lake Naivasha. In the early 1900s, Mount Longonot erupted, and ash can still be felt around Hell's Gate. Mount Longonot is a dormant stratovolcano located southeast of Lake Naivasha. Mount Suswa is a shield volcano located between Narok and Nairobi. Lava flows from the most recent eruptions are still not covered by vegetation, and may be no more than one hundred years old. Lake Magadi is the most southern rift valley lake in Kenya, although the northern end of Lake Natron in Tanzania reaches into Kenya. The Elgeyo escarpment forms part of the western wall. The Kerio Valley lies between the Tugen Hills and the Elgeyo escarpment at an elevation of There are large deposits of Fluorite in the Kerio Valley area. Further south the Mau Escarpment is a steep natural cliff approximately 1,000 m (3,300 ft) high, running along the western edge of the Great Rift Valley about Lake Naivasha. Yet further south the Nguruman Escarpment is around 50 kilometers long and elongated in N-W direction. Its northern edge is about southwest of Nairobi, while the southern edge is near the Tanzanian border, at the northwestern corner of Lake Natron. The Aberdare Range forms a section of the eastern rim of the Great Rift Valley to the north of Nairobi. Mount Satima lies at the northern end of the Aberdares and is their highest point, and Mount Kinangop at the southern end is the second highest. The mountains form a ridge between these two peaks. Ngong Hills are peaks in a ridge along the east of the Great Rift Valley, located southwest near Nairobi.  Lakes  Kenya is home to 64 (9.50%) of the total lakes found within the continent of Africa. Eight of these make up the main lakes in the Kenyan Rift Valley. From north to south, the names of these lakes are Lake Turkana, Lake Logipi, Lake Baringo, Lake Bogoria, Lake Nakuru, Lake Elmenteita, Lake Naivasha, and Lake Magadi. Of those eight, only Lakes Baringo and Naivasha are fresh water. East African Rift Valley, Kenya ISS 2012 Lake Turkana, at the northern end of the rift, is long, between and wide and is at its greatest depth. Most of the other lakes are shallow and poorly drained, and therefore have become alkaline. They have waters that are rich in blue-green algae, which feed insect larvae, small crustaceans and lesser flamingos. The larvae and crustaceans are food for fish and greater flamingos. Massive flocks of these birds have been found to have an effect on the lakeside sediments also. Their numbers cause trampling of the silts in certain areas, while the feeding grounds are oxygenated due to probing beaks in the mud. Their nest mounds can also be preserved and cemented as the lake's water levels change. These form irregularities in the lakeside topography. Trona, an evaporative mineral, used for sodium carbonate production, has been mined at Lake Magadi for nearly 100 years. It produces about 250,000 metric tonnes per year. Other precious minerals like rubies and pink sapphires have been found and mined from areas around Lake Baringo. In 2004, over 2 kilograms of Corundum were collected. Lake Bogoria is a caustic cauldron fringed by geysers and populated by over a million flamingos. Three shallow alkaline lakes and the surrounding lands make up the Kenya lake system: Lake Bogoria at , Lake Nakuru at and Lake Elementaita at . This system has one of the most diverse populations of birds in the world, and is the home of thirteen globally threatened species of bird. It is an important nesting and breeding site for great white pelicans, and is the most important feeding area for lesser flamingos in the world. The system is home to globally important populations of black-necked grebe, African spoonbill, pied avocet, little grebe, yellow-billed stork, black-winged stilt, grey-headed gull and gull-billed tern. The Kenya lake system is a key location on the West Asian- East African Flyway, a route followed by huge numbers of birds in their annual migration from breeding grounds in the north to wintering places in Africa. The lands around the lakes include large populations of black rhino, Rothschild's giraffe, greater kudu, lion, cheetah and wild dogs. The Kenya lake system is surrounded by the steep escarpment of the Rift Valley, which provides a spectacular backdrop. Other lakes are Lake Chew Bahir, in the northeast extension. This lake lies mainly in Ethiopia but extends into Kenya in the rainy season. Lake Kamnarok is another small lake.

The service was founded in 2008 by Marco Arment and has around 2 million users as of late 2011. In April 2013, Marco sold a majority stake to Betaworks and by mid 2016 Pinterest acquired the company. In July 2018, ownership of Instapaper was transferred from Pinterest to a newly formed company Instant Paper, Inc. The transition was completed on August 6, 2018. History Instapaper started out as a simple web service in late 2007 with a \\"Read Later\\" bookmarklet and stripped-down \\"Text\\" view for articles. When Marco Arment launched the service publicly on January 28, 2008, its simplicity rapidly earned accolades from the press, including Daring Fireball and TechCrunch. In April 2013, Arment sold a majority stake in Instapaper to Betaworks. Afterward, the service's web interface was redesigned. On August 23, 2016, Instapaper was acquired by social networking service Pinterest. The service will continue to operate, and the Instapaper staff will work on development for both Instapaper and Pinterest. On November 1, 2016, Instapaper announced that it would discontinue its subscription model and offer its \\"Premium\\" features to all users. On May 23, 2018, Instapaper announced that it had suspended its services for residents of the European Union in order to address compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. Service was restored on August 7, 2018. Features Instapaper can be used via a web-based interface, or through mobile apps for Android and iOS. Within a web browser, a \\"Read Later\\" bookmarklet can be used to save pages to a user's personal unread queue on Instapaper. Every article is automatically reformatted to remove excessive formatting and graphics. Instapaper was initially distributed as a paid app. Later, the app became a free service, but with certain features exclusive to a \\"Pro\\" version of the app, and later an \\"Instapaper Premium\\" subscription, such as ad-free browsing, full-text search, and voice dictation on supported platforms. These features became free for all users on November 1, 2016. iOS Instapaper's free iPhone app (removed from the App Store on March 12, 2011) with offline reading was one of the first apps in the App Store on July 12, 2008. Instapaper's paid app, then called Instapaper Pro, launched shortly afterward on August 26, 2008 and introduced tilt scrolling, which automatically scrolls a column of text when the device is tilted slightly up or down. On March 10, 2011, with the launch of the 3.0 app, Instapaper added social sharing and browsing features. Later in 2011, the redesigned 4.0 app added full-text search of all saved articles for customers with the optional $1/month subscription. The Instapaper iPad app launched with the iPad itself on April 3, 2010. Android The Instapaper for Android was built by development shop Mobeluxhttp://mobelux.com in 2012 and supports Android phones and tablets. Kindle An automatic send-to-Kindle feature was added on March 8, 2009. The Kindle feature alone is used by over 60,000 Kindle owners as of late 2011. Manually sending individual articles, or digests of recent articles, from the Instapaper app is currently a Subscriber feature. The Feature On June 1, 2008, Instapaper launched Give Me Something to Read, a standalone website that featured a few high- quality, longform, nonfiction articles every day from Instapaper's most frequently saved articles. Unlike a conventional social news website, which carries stories posted automatically by popularity, Give Me Something to Read is human-edited. Marco Arment was the editor for the site's first year. On July 27, 2009, Arment hired Richard Dunlop-Walters as a part-time contractor to take over as editor. As of March 2011, Dunlop-Walters was Instapaper's only employee besides Arment. On March 22, 2012, Give Me Something to Read was renamed The Feature. The articles are still hand-picked, and they are featured in Instapaper's website as The Feature, and in the iOS app as The Feature section. Marco Arment observed about The Feature (formerly known as Give Me Something to Read): > The very similar Longform and Longreads both started significantly later > than Give Me Something To Read but always got a lot more attention, with > Longreads fueled especially by its active Twitter presence. They‚Äôve both > done great things, but I always believed that Give Me Something To Read > deserved a similar level of attention that it never seemed to achieve. Reception Instapaper has been positively reviewed by publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, PC Magazine, Macworld, and Wired. Competitors and similar services Instapaper is one of several \\"read it later\\" (also known as \\"read later\\" or \\"saving\\") services. In November 2013, Mashable named Instapaper and the following four clients as the \\"5 Best Read-It-Later Apps\\"; they all support a variety of devices and other apps. * Pocket (originally titled \\"Read It Later\\"), began as a Firefox extension in late 2007, similar to Readeroo but using local browser storage, before matching Instapaper's core features later in 2008 and 2009. As of October 2013, it integrated with more than 300 apps, such as Flipboard and Twitter. * Readability, released in 2009 and discontinued in 2016, allows one to share to their social media accounts and easily send articles to their Amazon Kindle. Top Reads displays the most popular Readability articles and is fully integrated with Flipboard, Longform, Pulse, and Twitter clients such as Tweetbot. * Evernote Clearly, rolled out in 2011, allows users to download articles to the Evernote app as well as to the Chrome, Firefox, or Opera browser; it also works with Evernote Business and in conjunction with the Evernote Web Clipper. Web Clipper works with the aforementioned browsers, as well as Internet Explorer and Safari. As of January 22, 2016, Evernote discontinued support for Clearly. It is no longer available for download, and no further updates will be made to the extension. Customers with existing installations of the Clearly browser extension can continue using it. * ReadKit is an app for Mac devices (only) that supports Instapaper, Pocket, and Readability as well as Delicious, Feed Wrangler, FeedBin, Feedly, Fever, NewsBlur, and Pinboard. The app aggregates all of one's content from the abovementioned sources, so one need not switch from one app to another.

Plot As described in a film magazine, after a long sea voyage, Larry Smith (Farnum) comes home to find his sister (Bower) dead, the victim of some unknown person. Shortly after his mother (Drew) dies of a broken heart, Smith sets sail with a determination to wreck vengeance upon the murderer. Unknowingly he has become a mate to Captain Sutton (Nye), the man who ruined his sister. At a South Sea port Smith meets Violet North (Carmen), known as the Painted Lady. Smith falls in love with her and proposes, but she will not marry him because of her past, and the next day sails away with the rest of her party. Logan (Robbins), one of the \\"dogs\\" on Sutton's vessel, was a witness to Sutton's attack on the Smith girl and for this reason Sutton sails away leaving Logan on shore alone. Logan meets Smith and tells his tale. Logan and Smith search the islands for a trace of Sutton. When a storm rises and Violet, aboard a yacht, is tossed onto the island occupied by Smith.

The database was assembled by using a structure-based chemical shift calculation program (called SHIFTX) to calculate expected protein (1)H, (13)C and (15)N chemical shifts from X-ray or NMR coordinate data of previously assigned proteins reported in the BMRB. The comparison is automatically performed by a program called SHIFTCOR. The RefDB database currently provides reference-corrected chemical shift data on more than 2000 assigned peptides and proteins. Data from the database indicates that nearly 25% of BMRB entries with (13)C protein assignments and 27% of BMRB entries with (15)N protein assignments require significant chemical shift reference readjustments. Additionally, nearly 40% of protein entries deposited in the BioMagResBank appear to have at least one assignment error. Users may download, search or browse the database through a number of methods available through the RefDB website. RefDB provides a standard chemical shift resource for biomolecular NMR spectroscopists, wishing to derive or compute chemical shift trends in peptides and proteins. Scope and Access All data in RefDB is non-proprietary or is derived from a non-proprietary source. It is freely accessible and available to anyone. In addition, nearly every data item is fully traceable and explicitly referenced to the original source. RefDB data is available through a public web interface and downloads. Features All chemical shifts in RefDB have been computationally re-referenced to DSS (a common NMR chemical shift standard). RefDB is a continuously updated resource that uses web-bots to query public databases (BMRB, GenBank, Protein Data Bank) and fetch assignment, sequence and structure data on a weekly basis. It then applies a series of data checking routines (using keywords to remove paramagnetic or denatured proteins) followed by a series of calculations to identify and correct chemical shift referencing errors. RefDB is fully web- enabled database, it stores data in two standard formats (NMR-STAR and Shifty), it performs automated data updating, checking and validation and it provides open access to output data in a fully downloadable flat file format as well as in a hyperlinked browsable table (see Fig. 2). RefDB also supports keyword queries and sequence searches (using local BLAST). RefDB is usually updated on a weekly basis. The RefDB database, along with its associated software, is freely available at http://refdb.wishartlab.com and at the BMRB website. Protocols RefDB has been prepared using a combination of three different computer programs. The first program (SHIFTX) calculates backbone 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts from protein 3D coordinate data. The second program (SHIFTCOR) compares the calculated shifts with the observed shifts, evaluates any statistically significant differences and performs the necessary chemical shift corrections. The third program (UPDATE) automatically retrieves newly deposited BMRB data along with any corresponding PDB data. UPDATE also directs the data to SHIFTCOR and appends the ‚Äòcorrected‚Äô chemical shift file to the RefDB database.

He spent the majority of his career in non-League football, but made 31 appearances in the Football League for Nelson during the 1928‚Äì29 season. Biography Harry Ridley was born in Sunderland, County Durham, on 25 November 1904. He resided in the area for most of his life and died in Fulwell, a suburb of Sunderland, on 16 March 1989 at the age of 84. Career Ridley began his career in non- League football with Spennymoor United in the mid-1920s. In 1926, he had a trial with Football League Second Division side Fulham, but was not offered a professional deal and went to play in the Southern Football League with Aldershot. In July 1928, he was signed by Nelson of the Third Division North to replace Bill Slack, who had left the club at the end of the previous season. Ridley scored on his Nelson debut, playing at outside-left in the 2‚Äì2 draw with Hartlepools United on 28 August 1928.Dykes (2009), p. 82 He retained his place in the starting line-up until the end of November, scoring further goals against Wrexham and Crewe Alexandra. During the second half of the 1928‚Äì29 campaign, Ridley found his appearances limited as he shared the outside-left position with Tom Carmedy and Jack Fletcher. On 2 March 1929, he scored the only goal of the game as Nelson beat Carlisle United at Seedhill. In total, Ridley scored 7 goals in 31 league matches for the Lancashire club, netting his last goal in the final match of the season, a 4‚Äì4 draw with Accrington Stanley. At the end of the season only nine first-team players were retained and Ridley was one of those to leave Nelson, returning to non-League football with West Stanley. After spending a year with West Stanley, Ridley joined North Eastern League side Workington in August 1930. The following year he returned to Spennymoor United, where he remained for two seasons. Ridley transferred to Blyth Spartans in July 1933 and later had a spell with Murton Colliery Welfare, before returning to Spennymoor for a third time in December 1934.

After graduating in 1969 he moved to the United States to become a fighter pilot. During his studies in the United States he was chosen as the volleyball captain of the airbase volleyball team. Return to Iran After returning to Iran following flight training, he became a pilot of Northrop F-5.

There are, however, numerous former IRIAF pilots who not only deny that Baba‚Äôie ever even qualified on F-14s, but also outright refuse to even mention his name, most likely because of his close cooperation with the clerical regime in Tehran. Death Statute of Babaei at Babaei square, Qazvin General Abbas Babaei was killed on 6 August 1987, while in the rear seat of a F-5B while over Iraqi air space. He was hit by a 23 mm round of an air defense system on Sardasht air space, a city located in west Azerbaijan, Iran. It turned out Iranians' defense system, operated by Sepah, had hit Babaei's aircraft in error. The pilot, Major Ali Mohammad Naderi managed to land the jet, but Babaei died within 10 minutes. Sepah used the ZSU-23 self- propelled, radar guided anti-aircraft weapon system (SPAAG) at the time. In 2011, The Delight of the Flight was shown on Channel 1. The film was about Babaei's lifetime.

Chemical shift referencing is a particularly widespread problem in biomolecular NMR with up to 25% of existing NMR chemical shift assignments being improperly referenced. Some of these referencing problems can lead to systematic errors of between 1.0 to 2.5 ppm (especially in 13C and 15N chemical shifts). Errors of this magnitude can play havoc with any attempt to compare assignments between proteins or to structurally interpret chemical shifts. Identifying which proteins are mis-assigned or improperly referenced can be challenging, as can correcting the errors once they are found. The SHIFTCOR program was designed to assist with identifying and fixing these chemical shift referencing problems. Specifically it compares, identifies, corrects and re-references 1H, 13C and 15N backbone chemical shifts of peptides and proteins by comparing the observed chemical shifts with the predicted chemical shifts derived from the 3D structure (using PDB coordinates) of the protein(s) of interest [1]. The predicted chemical shifts are calculated using the ShiftX program. The SHIFTCOR program was originally used to construct a database of properly re-referenced protein chemical shift assignments called RefDB. RefDB is a web-accessible database of more than 2000 correctly referenced protein chemical shift assignments. While originally available as a stand-alone program only, SHIFTCOR has since been released for general use as a web server.

Hokmavar is restricted to Sham Qazan and Akhini neighbourhoods in south, Jamshidabad neighbourhood in north, Vijaviya and Bahar neighbourhoods in east and Qaramalek neighbourhoods in west. Hokmavar has been mentioned in historic Persian travel literature. Hokmavar was originally a village near Tabriz, however with the expansion of the city within last decade it has become a neighbourhood of Tabriz. Old Hokmavar village had two gates and four squares which were destroyed mostly within the last decades of gentrification. There are still several historic mosques remaining in Hokmavar. Hokmavar historical bath has been saved. During the Iranian constitutional revolution, Hokmavar was an important resistance center against Mohammad Ali Shah's forces. Ahmad Kasravi, who was born and grown up in Hokmavar, has documented his memories of the constitutional revolution in one of his book History of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. During Iran-Iraq war 200 participants from Hokmavar in the war have been killed and also Hokmavar was bombarded in 1986. Hokmavar is the main olericulture center of Tabriz, due to its large vegetable farms, which partially have survived the city expansion. At least since Pahlavi period, Tabriz municipality has had a plan to change the farms into a large park, Tabriz Grand Park, however, the plan was postponed several times. Within last decade, Tabriz municipality has captured some of Hokmavar's farms, claiming that they will be changed into a park. However, part of those captured lands have been changed into settlement land use and new neighbourood of Nezampezeski has been established. Similarly, majority of Tabriz's historic gardens in its old neighbourhoods have been changed into settlements. Recently, a few of the farms of Hokmavar has been changed into a park and a road has been built in the middle of the farms. On 8 August 2015, a group of Hokmavar farmers had a protest against Tabriz municipality plans. A poetry book on Hokmavar, called Hokmavar Nameh, has been written by a native of Hokmavar.  Etymology  There are several opinions on the etymology of Hokmavar. Some consider it as composed of two Azerbaijani words: \\"Hami (all)\\" and \\"Kavar (vegetable, olericulture), and the name of district can also be related to Avar. Dehkhoda dictionary translates the Persian word ÿ≠⁄©ŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿØ (Hokmabad) into vegetable farm. It is also mentioned to be originated from middle Persian, meaning beautiful garden cottage. According to Ahmad Kasravi in his controversial book on the etymology of the names of the Iranian cities and villages \\"avar\\" means place. and therefore Hokmavar means place of ruling. It has also been mentioned that Hokmavar comes from Azerbaijani words meaning \\"walls made out of brick and stone in a special form\\" and then has been persianized.

Niven first signed for East Fife in 1942, after being spotted by East Fife manager John McArthur. He made his first senior appearance for Hibernian, during a temporary loan in March 1942. Niven was also loaned to Dundee before he broke into the East Fife first team. He was their regular first choice goalkeeper during their period of success after the Second World War. Niven only conceded one goal in 210 minutes of football in the 1947 Scottish League Cup Final win against Falkirk. Former Scotland goalkeeper Jack Harkness praised Niven afterwards in his match report for the Sunday Post. East Fife won the B Division championship in 1948. Niven appeared to be on course for further success in the 1949‚Äì50 season, but he was injured before the League Cup semi-final. East Fife won both the semi-final against Rangers and the final against Dunfermline without him. East Fife then reached the 1950 Scottish Cup Final, but Niven was injured in a league match five days earlier. The second choice goalkeeper was also injured.http://qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1033 \\"Queens Legends - Bobby Black\\" This meant that 21-year-old Gordon Easson had to make his first team debut for East Fife in the Cup Final.

He played in the 1952 Scottish League Cup Final, which Kilmarnock lost 2‚Äì0 to Dundee. Niven retired from senior football in 1953 and became a mechanical engineer, working for Sir William Arrol & Co.

The book tells of the trio during the Depression and Prohibition in rural Virginia, who made a living bootlegging moonshine. The novel is told from both the perspectives of the three Bondurant brothers, mainly focusing on the youngest, Jack, and of the writer Sherwood Anderson, who described Franklin County in that period as the \\"wettest county in the world\\" while working there as a journalist during Prohibition. The film Lawless (2012), directed by John Hillcoat, is based on the book with a screenplay by Nick Cave. Background The novel, inspired by the author's paternal grandfather Jack and two grand-uncles, Forrest and Howard, focuses on the historical events of the Great Franklin County Moonshine Conspiracy, a series of events and a trial related to the illegal activities of the moonshiners in Franklin County. Sherwood Anderson was there working as a journalist at the time. To research the historical period, Bondurant listened to family stories and used archival records, news clippings and court transcripts. Locals began to think of the three brothers as \\"indestructible\\" because all of them survived. In an essay, Bondurant said that he had illegal moonshine from Franklin County, despite having been raised in Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C.. As a teenager, he first drank moonshine, and he knows his relatives in Franklin County drank moonshine at family events. Bondurant said he had difficulty getting information from people in Franklin when researching the novel. The illegal liquor-making in the county is a topic not often broached in public. He says that \\"you could spend years [in Franklin County] and never see [moonshine drinking], even as it is all around you.\\" Style The New York Times Book Review emphasized that the lyrical and lively style of the novel is in service to extremely grotesque subject matter with detail that \\"can leave a reader queasy\\". Similarly, Lauren Bufferd at BookPage.com warned readers that the novel is \\"extremely graphic, with multiple descriptions of physical injury, brutality and sadistic behavior.\\" The novel takes place on two different story lines: the first follows the Bondurant brothers during the 1920s and 1930s, while the second takes place in 1934 as Sherwood Anderson writes about their feats. The New York Times book reviewer, Louisa Thomas, suggests that this juxtaposition of chronologies works well in some situations but not in others, causing unnecessary complication for the reader. Reception In The New York Times Book Review, Louisa Thomas noted that the \\"prose is lyrical\\" but had mixed feelings about the use of a broken narration as the fictional reporter Anderson investigates the \\"Bondurant boys\\". Ann H. Fisher of Library Journal called the book \\"a cracklingly good novel, with plenty of action and local color.\\" She also noted that the book should be included in \\"regional collections\\" in Virginia. Reviewing the audiobook edition of the novel for Library Journal, Scott R. DiMarco called the story a \\"gripping, hauntingly told tale\\" and recommended that libraries purchase the audiobook. Film adaptation The novel was optioned in 2006, but the project's initial financing was lost in early 2010. The project was revived later that year. A film adaptation of the book, entitled Lawless and directed by John Hillcoat, was released on 31 August 2012. The film stars Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, and Jason Clarke as the three Bondurant brothers. Also in the film are Gary Oldman, Guy Pearce, Jessica Chastain, and Mia Wasikowska. The screenplay was written by Nick Cave, who earlier wrote the screenplay for Hillcoat's The Proposition (2005).

Pascual Chavez Villanueva, Rector Major of the Salesians, speaks of him as \\"the great missionary of India and of the Philippines in the footsteps of St Francis Xavier\\".\\"Non posso non accennare a uno dei salesiani pi√π rinomati di questa Ispettoria, don Jos√© Luis Carre√±o Echand√≠a, il grande missionario dell‚ÄôIndia e delle Filippine sull‚Äôesempio di San Francesco Saverio, la cui tomba sono andato a visitare con venerazione, ammirazione e riconoscenza, nella Casa del Missionario che egli stesso ha voluto costruire ad Alzuza.\\" ‚ÄúVoi siete una lettera di Cristo, scritta non con l‚Äôinchiostro, ma con lo Spirito del Dio vivente‚Äù (2¬™ Cor 3,3), Letter of the Rector Major, ACG 383, Rome, 8 Settembre 2003. Early life Born on 23 October 1905 to Rogelio and Teresa, Carre√±o entered the Salesian school of Santander, Spain, in November 1913, and later the school for aspiring Salesians at Campello. From Campello he went to the Salesian novitiate at Carabanchel Alto in 1921, and made his profession on 25 July 1922. After a brief military service, he made his perpetual profession at Sarr√¨a on 11 December 1928. He was ordained priest at Gerona on 21 May 1932.J. Rico, \\"Jose Luis Carre√±o.\\" The Memory of the Salesian Province of Bombay 1928-1998, ed. Peter Gonsalves (Matunga: Province Information Office, Don Bosco Provincial House, 1998) p. 60. India Having volunteered for the missions, he spent a year at Cowley, England, studying English. He set sail for India and landed in Bombay in 1933. When the second Salesian province was formed in South India, with its provincial house at Vellore, Carre√±o, not yet 28 years old, was sent to as novice master to Tirupattur.Thekkedath 2:1375. In August 1939, India felt the echoes of World War II. All foreigners, including missionaries who belonged to countries at war with Great Britain, were taken to concentration camps in 1942. Carre√±o, belonging to a neutral country, was not disturbed, and was even able to mediate for his fellow Salesians before the authorities.Rico, p. 61. Provincial, South India In 1943, in the middle of the war, Carre√±o received a message over the Vatican Radio to take the place of Eligio Cinato, the provincial of the Southern province, who had been interned. At the same time, the Salesian Archbishop Louis Mathias of Madras invited him to be his Vicar General. In 1945 Carre√±o was officially appointed provincial.Thekkedath 2:790. The Salesian centres doubled under the leadership of Carre√±o: Kotagiri (1946), Poonamallee (1947), Nagercoil (1947). In his term Fr Aurelius Maschio managed to buy land in Mumbai and begin building what is today Don Bosco High School (Matunga). One of Carre√±o's most far-reaching acts was to begin a university college in the remote and large Dalit village of Tirupattur. The college went on to transform the whole district. It was also Carre√±o who was largely responsible for ‚ÄòIndianizing‚Äô the face of the Salesians in India, by searching for local recruits instead of relying solely on missionaries.Rico, p. 61. \\"The most lasting contribution of Fr. Carre√±o to the province, and indirectly to Salesian India as a whole, was the effort that he made to increase the number of candidates to the priesthood and to Salesian life.\\"Thekkedath 2:1377. On Carre√±o's term as Provincial, see Thekkedath vol. 2, ch. 24, pp. 783-870. Goa At the end of the war, certain of the interned Salesians were not allowed to stay on in British India. They hit upon the idea of going to Goa, then a Portuguese enclave. The first Salesian to enter Goa was Vincenzo Scuderi. He was followed by a group of seven others, including Giuseppe Moja. In October 1952, Carre√±o himself was sent to Goa. He stayed there eight years. During this time the work expanded to include two technical schools, a high and elementary school, two public churches, one of them in Panjim dedicated to the Pilgrim Virgin; the care of more than 600 poor boys, the presses, the Catholic Hour on the government radio station, and the work for vocations. When the Indian government broke diplomatic relations with Portugal over the issue of Goa, Carre√±o was called by the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to act as an intermediary in the liberation of Indian prisoners in Goa. Four months later Goa granted amnesty to the Indian prisoners. Between Madras and Goa, Carre√±o spent almost thirty years in India.Rico 61-62. Philippines and Spain From Goa he was assigned to work in the Philippines. He arrived in 1962 and remained hardly 3 years. He is, however, remembered with great affection by the young people and Salesians who knew him. During his stay in the Philippines, there were differences of opinion about ways of going ahead with the Salesian work, between missionaries who had come from China and others like Carre√±o who had come from India and elsewhere. He went back to Spain where he founded the Hogar del Misionero (House for Missionaries).Chavez Villanueva, ACG 383. He died on May 29, 1986 in Spain.Rico 62. Writer and poet Carre√±o was a prolific writer of popular books. Some of them, such as G in M (\\"God in a Mirror\\"), were apologetic. Many were religious. His books on the Shroud of Turin have been translated into several languages (see Bibliography below), and may still be found in print. He not only wrote, but also encouraged others to write; evidence of this is his election as Patron of the Konkani writers association in Goa during his stay there. Among his musical compositions was the beautiful Latin hymn \\"Cor Iesu Sacratissimum\\", and \\"Siam Salesiani\\", sung in English translation as \\"We are Salesians\\". Among his more popular compositions was Kotagiri on the mountain, Tirupattur on the plain. Bibliography Primary * G in M [God in a Mirror]. Panjim. * Warp in the Loom. * El Retrato de Cristo - Ed.

Where basic healthcare treatments were hard to come by, especially across the hinterlands of Uttar Pradesh, she has brought world class facilities there. The humanitarian efforts in healthcare she has been undertaking in remote corners of the country has saved many lives.  Early life  Niira Radia (n√©e Nira Menon) was born on 19 November 1960 in Nairobi, Kenya in a Punjabi family. In the 1970s the family moved to London where she attended Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls followed by the University of Warwick. In 1981 she married Janak Radia, a Gujarati businessman, with whom she had 3 sons. In 1994, the Radias divorced and Niira moved to India as a Person of Indian Origin. On the advice of a numerologist, she added an extra letter to her name to make it \\"Niira\\".  Career   Travel agent  Between 1988 and 1993 Niira Radia incorporated a string of travel and aviation related companies in London, in which she and her family members were shareholders and held positions such as company secretary and director. By 1995 these companies had been liquidated, many of them after filing bankruptcy.  Aviation consultant  In 1994 Radia's father, Iqbal Menon, met an advisor to Sahara Airlines at a party in London who mentioned that the airlines was looking to lease Boeing 737-400 aircraft to expand the business. Menon, who was involved in Radia's aircraft lease business, sent Radia to New Delhi, India to meet Sahara Airlines CEO, Uttam Kumar Bose. Radia helped Sahara negotiate with International Lease Finance Corporation, a Los Angeles based company, for the lease of two Boeing 737-400 aircraft and spare parts. A Boeing 737-700 aircraft operated by Sahara Airlines at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi. In 1995 Radia rented an office in Vasant Vihar, Delhi. She was hired by the Sahara Group in New Delhi, India as an aviation consultant. Acting as a liaison officer, Radia used her expertise in the areas of travel, aviation, government policies and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board to resolve Sahara Airlines' issues with the commercial department at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi. During these negotiations, Radia met Rao Dheeraj Singh, a traffic supervisor with Sahara Airlines, and grandson of former Haryana Chief Minister Rao Birender Singh. In March 1996 Radia persuaded Singh to quit Sahara Airlines and join her as a business partner in Mumbai. At the behest of part-owner Chandu Panjabi, Radia was to work on getting foreign hotel management companies interested in the restoration of Hotel Sea Rock, Bandra that had been damaged in the 1993 Bombay bombings.Hotel Sea Rock, Bandra as seen in 2008. It was abandoned after the 1993 Bombay bombings. While in Mumbai, Radia also arranged funding for Agni Sakshi (1996), a Hindi film produced by Chandu Panjabi's friend, Binda Thackeray, Bal Thackeray's son. In early 1997, Radia and Singh moved back to New Delhi. Acting as aviation consultants, they traveled to Bahrain with Sahara Airlines CEO, Uttam Kumar Bose, to negotiate the purchase of helicopters from Eurocopter.Eurocopter AS-355N operated by Air Sahara as part of its helicopter charter service. After a successful negotiation, Sahara Airlines placed a $25 million order for four helicopters - three AS-355Ns and one AS-365N Dauphin. The deal netted Radia and Singh a huge commission that they routed through Sofema, a company created the same year for guiding the foreign sales of large French aeronautic and defence groups. To bring the money into India, Radia and Singh made several trips to London and Dubai together. Following the trip to Bahrain, Singh and his wife, Anjum, had an acrimonious divorce. Radia moved from a rented flat in Safdarjung Development Area to a residential estate in Asola. She arranged for her three sons and her sister to come from London and live in India with her. Singh also moved in with her and Radia began introducing herself as Singh's wife on social occasions. She also certified herself as Singh's spouse in legal papers. After the 1998 Indian general election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) formed a government under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for a year. On 19 March 1998 Ananth Kumar, representing the Bangalore South Lok Sabha constituency in Karnataka, became the Minister of Civil Aviation. Radia became emotionally close to Anantha Kumar. Kumar introduced Radia to Swami Vishwesha Teertha, who became her spiritual guru. In July 1998 Radia incorporated Crownmart International (India) and became its CEO. KLM uk hired Crownmart to handle the legal formalities involved in the return of two aircraft leased to ModiLuft by AirUK in 1996.Boeing 737-200 aircraft operated by ModiLuft in the mid 1990s. The aircraft had been impounded by the Central Board of Excise and Customs for non-payment of ‚Çπ8.5 crore (‚Çπ85 million) as Inland Air Travel Tax collected by ModiLuft from passengers but not remitted to the Government of India. Radia and Singh worked with prominent lawyer RK Anand who filed a case with Delhi High Court. Anand and his team of lawyers were able to persuade the court to pass an order to release the aircraft on the condition that AirUK would first deposit ‚Çπ8 crore (‚Çπ80 million) with the government and furnish a bank guarantee of ‚Çπ4.5 crore (‚Çπ45 million). Radia's lawyers informed her that the court order could be stayed by the next morning. Radia ensured that ‚Çπ8 crore was deposited the same day and AirUK's pilots took off that same evening. Crownmart earned ‚Çπ2.5 crore (‚Çπ25 million) as fees for getting the aircraft back into the possession of KLM uk. After the sale of Eurocopter helicopters to Sahara, Sofema approached Radia and Singh suggested that they help broker the sale of helicopters to the Maharashtra and Karnataka state governments. Even though it was forbidden for state governments to use middlemen and commission agents in the purchase of helicopters, Radia and Singh traveled to London to sign a contract with Sofema. Since a Shiv Sena-BJP government was in power at Maharashtra at that time, Radia asked Ananth Kumar to arrange a meeting with a senor BJP functionary in Nagpur who facilitated the deal. The Maharashtra government, then under the Indian National Congress ultimately bought an AS365 N3 Dauphin helicopter from Eurocopter in April 2001 at the cost of ‚Çπ23 crore (‚Çπ230 million). The Karnataka government did not buy a helicopter after initially expressing interest. In 1999 Radia persuaded Ananth Kumar as Minister of Civil Aviation to block the approval for Jet Airways to acquire five new aircraft from ATR, a French-Italian aircraft manufacturer. Since Naresh Goyal, the CEO of Jet Airways, refused to deal with Radia, she went to ATR who agreed to pay her ‚Çπ1.85 crore (‚Çπ18.5 million) to get the approval from the Ministry of Civil Aviation. To receive their commission Radia, Singh and Karuna Menon traveled to Zurich to open Swiss bank accounts. They also opened accounts in the Channel Islands, a tax haven. In April 1999 Radia persuaded Ananth Kumar as Minister of Civil Aviation to change its policy of aircraft acquisition from Boeing to Airbus for Air India's new fleet requirements. The ministry began a formal process of aircraft evaluation for the purchase of 39 aircraft at a cost of ‚Çπ9,000 crore (‚Çπ90 billion) but the evaluation of offers was stopped in August 1999 due to upcoming Lok Sabha elections. When rumours began to circulate in the Indian media that India's aviation policy was being influenced by the minister's relationship with Radia, Ananth Kumar was removed from his position as Minister of Civil Aviation. In 2000 Singapore Airlines was keen to re-negotiate a more liberal air bilateral pact with the Indian civil aviation ministry in order to obtain a staggered increase in its flight frequencies over a multi-year period. Singapore Airlines approached Radia who got it done. Singapore Airlines was at that time also in talks with Ratan Tata over a 40% stake in Air India and it put in a good word for Radia.  Airline owner  In 2000 Radia attempted to start her own airline, Crown Air, but the Ministry of Civil Aviation declined to give her permission because it failed to meet the requirements for adequate paid-up capital, ownership pattern, equity base and appointment of a chairman. Radia increased the paid-up capital from just ‚Çπ1 lakh (‚Çπ1,00,000) to ‚Çπ30 crore (‚Çπ30 million); clarified that she and her sister, Karuna Menon, were the promoters; obtained approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) and the Home ministry to raise equity abroad; and started negotiations with International Lease Finance Corporation to obtain aircraft. However, her application was declined again for lack of transparency in funding. In August 2000 Uttam Kumar Bose was sacked as CEO of Sahara Airlines after aircraft lease rentals negotiated by him were found to be as much as 50 percent higher than market rates. He joined Crown Air as CEO but went back to Sahara after nine months. In 2004 Radia tried once again to start her own airline by taking over the defunct ModiLuft and renaming it Magic Air. Uttam Kumar Bose once again quit Sahara Airlines to help launch Magic Air. Radia failed to get permission because of her foreign citizenship and rules forbidding foreign investment in Indian domestic aviation.  PR Veteran  Also see Radia tapes controversy In 2000 Ratan Tata, fresh from the failure to obtain a stake in Air India along with Singapore Airlines, decided to consolidate the public relations and advocacy functions for the Tata Group as a whole. Impressed by her smooth handling of the Singapore Airlines bilateral pact with India, Tata offered all 90 Tata Group accounts to Radia, who set up Vaishnavi Corporate Communications Pvt Ltd (VCCPL) in 2001 for public relations work. Apart from the Tata Group Radia also handled clients such as Unitech Group, Confederation of Indian Industry, Hindustan Construction Company and the GMR Group. From 2005 to 2009 Radia head-hunted a number of senior Indian bureaucrats. In 2005 she hired Satish Kumar Narula, former Chairman, Airports Authority of India (AAI), who had retired in January 2004. He joined Vaishnavi Communications as a company director. Former secretary of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ajay Dua, former secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation Akbar Jung, and former Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, V. Subramanian, also joined Vaishnavi Communications for a brief period of four months each in 2009. In 2007, Radia incorporated Noesis Strategic Consulting Services Pvt. Ltd. with former Finance Secretary CM Vasudev and former chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Pradip Baijal, as its founding members. In 2008 former TRAI member DPS Seth worked with Noesis as an advisor. Noesis' clients included Tata Teleservices, Tata Communications, Vedanta Resources, and the government of Oman. In 2008 Mukesh Ambani also decided to outsource all of Reliance Industries public relations and lobbying work to Radia, who set up Neucom Consulting just for this purpose. In 2009, the tapes formed the foundation of the 2G spectrum case in which the government was accused of selling scarce radio spectrum at throwaway prices to ineligible companies. The national auditor pegged potential revenue loss at ‚Çπ176,000 crore (‚Çπ1,760 billion). In 2011, following the Radia tapes controversy, Radia announced her exit from corporate lobbying and closed down Vaishnavi Communications. In 2012, she started a consulting firm called Pegasus International Advisory. In February 2012, the SC cancelled 122 2G licences. In 2010 India Today magazine sardonically named Niira Radia as the newsmaker of the year.  Sudesh Foundation  In 2002 Radia established a charitable trust called Sudesh Foundation in her late mother Sudesh Sharma's memory. The foundation funded the construction of a Pejavara Adokshaja muth Sri Krishna temple at Vasant Kunj, an expensive area of Delhi, for which land was allocated by the government at very low prices. At a function in 2002 Pejavara Swami Vishwesha Teertha was present, along with senior BJP leader L. K. Advani who lay the foundation stone for the temple. The foundation had helped scholars publish books and devotional singers get their music CDs released.  Nayati Healthcare  Nayati Healthcare started out with its mobile van services in 2012 and on 20 February 2013 Niira Radia incorporated Nayati Healthcare & Research Pvt. Ltd. as a non-governmental organization (NGO) with her sister, Karuna Menon and herself as company directors and built a hospital in Mathura of the same name. On 28 February 2016 Ratan Tata inaugurated Nayati Healthcare's first hospital in Mathura, a district in Uttar Pradesh.. The hospital further expanded its territory to New Delhi and Gurugram in 2018, by acquiring local hospitals - Sunder lal Jain hospital and Vimhans PrimaMed.  Controversy   Kidnapping of son  On 28 April 2003 Rao Dheeraj Singh, Radia's former business partner, was arrested by Delhi Police for allegedly kidnapping Niira Radia's teenage son. The police also searched Singh's office and took away all files in his possession relating to Radia's business dealings. Singh was charged under Indian Penal Code Sections 364A, 365, 307, 120B/34. Singh spent nearly a year and a half in jail before lawyer RK Anand filed bail for him. In 2011 Singh gave an interview to a media channel in which he portrayed the kidnapping charge against him as the outcome of a business rivalry between him and Radia. Radia's son filed contempt of court charges against Singh as the case against him was still pending.  Biography by RK Anand  In May 2011 Radia filed a defamation suit against lawyer RK Anand for his book titled Close Encounters of Niira Radia and described as an unauthorized \\"tell all\\" biography about Niira Radia and her activities as a corporate lobbyist. Radia demanded ‚Çπ1 crore (‚Çπ10 million) as damages, alleging that Anand had revealed \\"privileged communications\\" between a lawyer and a client. Delhi High Court stayed the release and circulation of the book, originally slated for a launch in June 2011.  Taped conversations  Over a six-month period in 2009 India's Income Tax department taped Radia's phone conversations at the time of cabinet formation after general elections. A news magazine published transcripts of the taped conversations that implicated Radia's influence in how key ministerial portfolios were allocated. These phone recordings led to the 2G spectrum case involving former telecommunications minister A Raja, which subsequently led to his resignation from his post. A report filed by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) in April 2013 based on its investigation into the tapes pointed out technical violations by Radia's public relations and lobbying firm Vaishnavi Corporate Communications Limited under the Companies Act, 1956 and recommended action against 11 top executives of the firm.  Panama Papers  Mossack Fonseca had set up firm linked to Niira Radia.http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/panama- papers-mossack-fonseca-set-up-nira-radias-foreign-company/232996/ An investigation of these papers shows the existence of one offshore entity owned by Radia, an International Business Company (IBC) registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) by Mossack Fonseka in 1994 named Crownmart International Group Limited. It was before she changed her name, evidently on the advice of her astrologers, and added another \\"i\\" to it. But Mossack Fonseca (MF) documents, investigated by The Indian Express, show her name simply as Nira Radia and establish that the PR professional whose telephone intercepts became public in 2010 managed an offshore account.

It is located approximately 929 light-years (285 parsecs, or about km) from Earth in the constellation Lyra. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. The planet is notable as it has the closest radius to Earth known so far. Characteristics Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f compared to Venus and Earth Mass, radius and temperature  Kepler-20f is very likely (>95% chance) a rocky planet because of its radius, which is notable as being the closest to Earth yet: 1.004 . However, although its radius is almost the same as Earth's, its surface conditions are not Earth-like in any way. The equilibrium temperature of Kepler-20f is approximately , too hot to support liquid water on its surface and hot enough to melt some types of metal. But because of its size, it can be expected to have an atmosphere of water vapor. The mass of the planet can be approximated to around 0.66‚Äì3.04 , depending on its composition. An Earth-like composition would have its mass to be around 1.2 . Host star Kepler-20 is a Sun-like star in the constellation Lyra with a mass of 0.91 (¬± 0.03) and a radius of 0.94 (¬± 0.06) , and is thought to be 8.8 billion years old, though there is a large uncertainty in its age. In other words, Kepler-20 is approximately 9% less massive and 6% shorter than the Sun. The star's metallicity is 0.01 (¬± 0.04), meaning that the level of iron (and, presumably, other elements) in the star is almost the same as that of the Sun. Metallicity plays an important role in planetary systems, and stars with higher metallicity are more likely to have planets detected around them. This may be because the higher metallicity provides more material with which to quickly build planets into gas giants or because the higher metallicity increases planet migration towards the host star, making the planet easier to detect. The star has four other known planets in orbit: Kepler-20b, Kepler-20c, Kepler-20d, and Kepler-20e. All of the planets in the system would fit inside the orbit of Mercury. Kepler-20 has an apparent magnitude of 12.51, too dim to be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Orbit Discovery In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-20; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-20f occurred roughly every 19 days (its orbital period), it was eventually concluded that a planetary body was responsible for the periodic 19-day transits. The exoplanet, along with the other planets of the Kepler-20 system and other planets around stars studied by Kepler, were announced on December 20, 2011.

The Varda Viaduct (), aka Giaour Dere Viaduct, locally known as \\"Alman K√∂pr√ºs√º\\" or \\"Koca K√∂pr√º\\" (literally: German Viaduct or Big Viaduct), is a railway viaduct situated at Hacƒ±kƒ±rƒ± (Kƒ±ralan) village in Karaisalƒ± district of Adana Province in southern Turkey. Designed and built by Imperial German engineers as part of the Baghdad Railway (Haydarpa≈üa Terminal, Istanbul-Baghdad), the stone arch structure is from Adana Central Station and from Konya. Design and construction The building of the viaduct was coupled with the construction of the Ottoman-German project of Istanbul-Baghdad railway line to connect Berlin with Basra, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to enable direct supply of oil to German industry. The most difficult terrain on the route to overcome was the section at the Taurus Mountains between Konya and Adana, more specifically around the region of Belemedik, where in a distance of 22 tunnels in a row had to be dug in twenty years. Financed by the German Deutsche Bank, the construction of the viaduct was commissioned to Philipp Holzmann & Cie, a renowned German construction company with experience in the field of major infrastructure works. The design and engineering work was carried out by the German Winkler and the Greek-Ottoman Nicholas Mavrogordato, who became responsible chief engineer after the death of Winkler. In 1903, the construction work force, consisting of German technical staff and thousands of multi-national workers, settled in a camp newly established in Belemedik, where all necessary facilities such as hospital, church, school, movie theatre and even mosque were built. The railway line had to cross the deep canyon of a creek called then Giaour Dere (today \\"√áakƒ±t Deresi\\") that is situated between Hacƒ±kƒ±rƒ± village and Karaisalƒ± town. Main materials such as steel and cement were shipped to Mersin by sea, and transported further via Tarsus to the construction site on camelback. Before the construction of the actual viaduct began, a temporary viaduct with a narrow gauge railway on it was built over the canyon close to the projected viaduct to bring all the necessary material to the other side. Following the completion of the Varda Viaduct, the auxiliary viaduct was taken out of service, however, its pillars are still existing. The construction began in 1905, and in 1907, the main works were completed. Technical details were accomplished in 1912. The railway on the viaduct went into service in 1916. The long and high structure consists of eleven ashlar arch spans in total. The central portion has three arches, with spandrel arches over the piers, and is flanked on each side by four arch spans, at one side one of , three of and at the other side four of . After erecting the masonry pillars, the arches were built over a temporary falsework steel frame, which was placed on the pillars. The viaduct, which spans in north-south direction, is curved having a radius of curvature of . The first Ottoman high official to pass over the Varda Viaduct was Minister of War Enver Pasha on February 18, 1917. Shortly before the end of World War I, the bridge was used by retreating German troops. Location and access The railway stations at opposite ends of the viaduct, Hacƒ±kƒ±rƒ± and Karaisalƒ± Bucaƒüƒ±, are still being served today by the \\"Central Anatolian Blue train\\" (). The nearest railway station to the viaduct is Hacƒ±kƒ±rƒ±, which is at a distance of about .

The only population centre within the territory is Cap-Seize, located south of Sainte-Anne-des-Monts along Quebec Route 299. It was established circa 1940 as a forestry centre and named after the nearby Cap-Seize Creek, a tributary of the Sainte-Anne River. While the name literally means \\"Cape Sixteen\\", it is actually a transformation of the English word \\"capsize\\", the creek's original name. A post office operated there from 1946 to 1969. The ghost town of Saint-Octave-de-l'Avenir is about south- southeast of Cap-Chat, at an altitude of . It was formed in 1932 as part of the Vautrin Settlement Plan to encourage colonization of Gasp√©sie's interior and intended to bring relief during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The settlement was named after founding priest Louis-Octave Caron (1879‚Äì1942) and a hopeful outlook of the future (avenir is French for \\"future\\"). It grew to 1200 residents in 1937 but then declined until it was abandoned in 1971. Only summer camps remain. The territory is home to the Chic-Choc Wildlife Reserve and Gasp√©sie National Park where the eponymous Mount Albert and Mont Jacques- Cartier are located. Mount Albert, with a peak, is the 9th highest peak in Quebec. It was named in honour of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha because geologist Alexander Murray made the first recorded ascent of the mountain on the Prince's birthday, 26 August 1845. Mount Jacques-Cartier, with an altitude of , is Quebec's second highest mountain. Both mountains are popular with hikers (the International Appalachian Trail traverses them both) and share a unique ecology for its latitude: snow cover for 9 months of the year and alpine tundra vegetation. Furthermore, the territory is also home to migratory woodland caribou, the only remaining herd south of the Saint Lawrence.
