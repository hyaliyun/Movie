It presents in several exhibition rooms, rocks and minerals from the region and fossils from the Olympus and from the surrounding area. It was established with the help of the Geology faculty of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.  Structure of the museum  While finds from the whole of Greece are exhibited in the classrooms, a separate exhibition room is devoted exclusively to Mount Olympus. The history of the formation of the mountains is shown. Various types of fossilized plants and fossils are exhibited.  The exhibits  Fossilized mussels The geological development of Greece will be explained with the help of folders. Using a model of the Olympus, the distribution of the various types of rock in the mountain range is shown. All known types of rocks occurring in the Olympus region are exhibited in showcases. As a result of the displacement of the continental plates, Olympus is still pushed up by one to four millimeters per year. This is the reason why there are petrified marine animals at a height of around 1000 to 1500 meters. A hitherto unique find was an ammonite found at an altitude of about 1100 meters. Other witnesses who were part of the mountain formerly under the sea level are limestones that were drilled by mussels (Litophagae) or limestones include petrified sea- worms. The Olymp is a so-called tectonic window. This means that erosion and warping have released old rock layers that would normally be hidden. This fact ensures that geologists from all over the world travel to Olympus for research purposes. Further panels explain that Mount Olympus got its present form after the W√ºrm ice age. As the ice receded, masses of gravel were moved along. This process shaped the landscape and influenced the shape of some stones. They are round at the top and flattened at the bottom. A showcase is devoted to the theme of petrification. Exhibited are petrified plants and animals. So far only a few smaller caves have been discovered. Some of them are filled with ice which does not melt even in summer. There is the possibility of astronomical observations at night.

The K√§seStrasse Bregenzerwald (\\"Cheese Street of the Bregenz Forest\\") is a non-profit organization and route which links cheese-producing businesses of the Bregenz Forest in Vorarlberg (Austria). The organization is a group of Bregenzerwald farmers, craftsmen and tradesmen. All members and partners of the K√§seStrasse contribute to preserving Bregenzerwald's agriculture, the Alpine transhumance and its domestic products.  History  The K√§seStrasse Bregenzerwald as an organization exists since 1998 and includes various roads of the Bregenzer forest. The organization has more than 200 members (2017) and there are all sorts of farmers: farms with farmyards, village farms, Alpine farms. It is a non-profit association promoting Bregenzerwald's cheese culture. The aim is to maintain and promote the regional value, to preserve the regional small structures and to shape the Bregenzerwald region as a cheese region. The high value and importance of cheese origins in the regional history of people. Milk and dairy products, especially the so-called mountain cheeses (Bergk√§se) produced on the alpine pastures and village dairies, were the basic food for the whole year of the Walser population for centuries. The cheese soon became an important export product, thus further developing its value for the economy. For producing the dairy-products, the local farmers drove livestock between the valleys in winter, the medium-high pastures in spring and high- pastures in summer. The milk obtained, separated from cow, goat and sheep milk (mainly cow raw milk), is transported down the road by means of a transport cableway or handcart or car, where a milk tank takes up the milk. The tanks are then brought to a cheese factory (today near Hittisau), where cheese production starts. This so-called alpine transhumance (also known as \\"Maiens√§√ü\\") shaped much of the landscape in the Alps and is still practiced today. Farms, farmers huts and alpine pastures are part of the typical scenery in Vorarlberg. The life of local people was heavily influenced by this form of seasonal migration and they developed traditional Alpine culture, such as Yodel, Alphorn or Schwingen.

Life Davidson was born on 17 January 1842 in St George Hanover Square, London, England. He lost his hearing at age four, whereupon he was sent as a private pupil to the Old Kent Road Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, and subsequently attended a \\"hearing\\" school in Clapham. Showing a flair for art, Davidson was admitted to the National Art Training School, Marlborough House (later the Royal College of Art); he went on to study under Francis Stephen Cary (1808-1880), James Mathews Leigh (1808-1860), and Alexander Johnston (1815-1891), before spending ten years at the Royal Academy, where he won the Academy's silver medals. In 1871, Davidson married artist Charlotte Douglas McHeath (1851-1930) in Marylebone; records show that in 1881 they were living with their six children at 82 Park Road, Hampstead, and in 1901 at 101 Greencroft Gardens, Hampstead. Davidson retired in 1908 to Mill Field, Walberswick, Suffolk, where he died aged 77 in November 1919. The artist was closely associated with St Saviour's Church, being part of the Deaf and Dumb Debating Society and on the Committee of the Charitable and Provident Society for the Deaf and Dumb. St Saviour's was located then on Oxford Street, London; the Oxford Street site is now a sports shop opposite Selfridges on the corner of Lumley Street. Davidson's approach to persevering with disability in a not universally compassionate age made him an erudite man. A 1917 book titled Peeps into the Deaf World records him as saying: \\"I am a great reader, and have read history, biography, books on travel, religion, and novels, besides the daily newspapers, and it is a great comfort ‚Äì this reading ‚Äì to one who is deaf, and to whom little is said.\\" His friends included Samuel Bright Lucas, son of MP John Bright and suffragette Margaret Bright Lucas, and wood engraver Charles Webb Moore, who was part of Frank Brangwyn's circle and responsible for Davidson's portrait. He was the father of artist Allan Douglas Davidson (1873-1932). Work England's Pride and Glory; 1894. Davidson specialised in historical naval scenes. For periods his painting focused on particular themes; for example, he completed between 1894 and 1899 a series relating to Lord Nelson, including the referential England's Pride and Glory (1894) which incorporates remarkable reproductions of three Nelson-related works by other painters. The large painting to the left is George Arnald's The Destruction of 'L'Orient' at the Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798; at the upper-right is Richard Westall's Nelson in conflict with a Spanish launch, 3 July 1797; and, to the lower-right, the most famous portrait of Nelson, by Lemuel Francis Abbott. Several other of Davidson's paintings illustrate episodes in the work of the Bront√´ family. Davidson exhibited at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, Dudley Museum and Art Gallery, the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery, Manchester City Art Gallery, the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists, the Royal Hibernian Academy, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and the Arthur Tooth & Sons Gallery.

Thus the sixth and final Forest Day was held on the sidelines of the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP18) in Doha, Qatar. =Agriculture and Rural Development Day = Agriculture and Rural Development Day (ARDD) was an annual COP side event. The first event took place as a side event at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen, Denmark. The fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5 (ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the COP18.  Annual Events  The first major GLF event took place in Warsaw, Poland during the 2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP19). The second major GLF event was held alongside the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP20) from December 6‚Äì7, 2014. There were 1700 attendees and 95 organizations in attendance. This event saw the launch of the Youth in Landscapes initiative. The third major GLF event was held alongside the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), December 5‚Äì6, 2015. There were 3200 attendees from 135 countries, including 19 Ministers and Heads of State, and 148 organizations. Notably, 200 indigenous peoples‚Äô representatives were sponsored to attend the 2015 Forum, and 45% of those in attendance were female. Initiatives launched at this event include: *AFR100 *Blue Carbon Initiative *Indonesian National Carbon Accounting System (INCAS) *Belantara Foundation *Danone's New Climate Policy The fourth major GLF event was held alongside the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP22), November 16, 2016. During this event, the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) and Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) announced a major injection of core funding to support the development of the GLF for the next five years. Initiatives launched at this event include: * Climate Resilience through Sweetpotato (CReSP) * Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 (TFA 2020) African Palm Oil Initiative(APOI) * Global Peatlands Initiative * Earth Innovation Institute Produce and Protect Platform * Five Great Forests Initiative * Atlas of Deforestation and Industrial Plantations in Borneo Following the major injection of funding from the German government during the Marrakesh event, the GLF moved to establish a more permanent presence in Bonn, Germany. While the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP23) was held in Bonn the same year from November 6‚Äì17, 2017, the Global Landscapes Forum event took place just over a month later on December 19‚Äì20, 2017. This marked the first year that the GLF existed as its own entity and not as a COP side event. For the first time, the Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award was presented at the GLF.  Thematic Events  The first Investment Case event took place on June 10‚Äì11, 2015 at the Royal Society in London, United Kingdom. It was an invitation-only symposium with 220 attendees from the finance sector. It was coordinated by the European Investment Bank, UN Environment, the World Bank, and the Program on Forests (PROFOR). Sessions were hosted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Unilever, and the Climate Bonds Initiative. The roadmap from this event were presented at a land use side event 14th World Forestry Congress (WFC XIV) in Durban, South Africa, the theme of which was Forests and People: Investing in a Sustainable Future. Other key outcomes were presented to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) workplan for 2015.  National and Policy Dialogues  Riau, Indonesia 2017: Laws and Best Practices for Reducing Fire and Haze The AFR100 initiative was launched at the GLF in Paris, 2015, and is also supported by the German government. Thus the GLF supported the Second Annual Partnership Conference in 2017, which brought together 23 partner countries, restoration champions, and technical partners such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), New Partnership for Africa‚Äôs Development (NEPAD Agency), and World Vision. Organized with CIFOR, this policy dialogue workshop looked at gender-responsive Forest and Landscape Restoration.

It is one of the largest organizations of its type in the world, with over 217,000 Chartered Professional Accountants in Canada and around the world. CPA Canada conducts research on business issues, supports the setting of accounting, auditing and assurance standards for business, non-profits and government, issues guidance and leadership connected to accounting, auditing, assurance and financial literacy, and generally supports the profession of accounting in Canada.  History  Historically, Canada had three nationally recognized accounting classifications until 2013: Chartered Accountant (CA), Certified Management Accountant (CMA), and Certified General Accountant (CGA). The national CA and CGA designations were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 (CA) and 1913 (CGA). The Canada Corporations Act of 1920 established the CMA designation. In January 2012, after eight months of discussions between members and stakeholders, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), the Society of Management Accountants of Canada (CMA Canada) and Certified General Accountants of Canada (CGA-Canada) published A Framework for Uniting the Canadian Accounting Profession. The document proposed the unification of the separate organizations into one new designation: Canadian Chartered Professional Accountant-CPA. One year later, on January 1, 2013, under the Canada Not-For-Profit Corporation Act, Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) was established by CICA and CMA Canada.The Act supported provincial accounting bodies that were coming together under the CPA designation. On October 1, 2014 CGA-Canada joined CPA-Canada, finishing the process of bringing all of Canada's professional accounting organizations together under the auspices of one nationally recognized organization. Today all recognized provincial and national Canadian accounting organizations are unified under the CPA designation. There are over 217,000 members in Canada and internationally who hold the Canadian CPA designation. CPA Competency Map The CPA Competency Map lays the foundation for the CPA certification program, including education, accreditation, examinations, and practical experience requirements, and describes the knowledge, skills and proficiency levels you must achieve to become a Canadian CPA.

CPA Canada and AFOA Canada signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2016 which included a provision for CPA Canada to integrate some course material from its ACAF program into the program which trains Certified Aboriginal Financial Managers, (CAFM). This proposal allows CAFM students to obtain an ACAF more quickly. In 2008 the Martin Family Initiative (first knows as the Martin Aboriginal Education Initiative (MAEI)) asked CPA Canada to create a mentoring program which would enhance the chances for educational changes for indigenous youth. The program expanded in 2015 to include the McCarthy Tetrault law firm and the Accounting and Legal Mentorship Program (ALMP) found in 29 schools. The program has succeeded in increasing graduation rates, motivated students to stay in school beyond the secondary level, and helped them find jobs, especially in the legal and accounting industries.  Public policy and government  The organization helps develop public policy through its involvement in the process. CPA Canada contributes its expertise on many issues relating to tax and fiscal policy, financial literacy, skills development, climate adaptation, immigration, trade, ethics, good governance and accountability. They are also called on to opine on budget prioritization, tax reform and responsible budgeting. Goals include the strengthening of financial literacy and supporting infrastructure projects that stimulate productivity.  Thought leadership  The organization offers guidance on accounting and business issues to its members and others through its publications, webinars, videos, blogs and other types of media. Among the subjects addressed are sustainability, tax, management and the future of financial reporting.  Education  Before CPA candidates can acquire certification they must complete a certification program which is developed by CPA Canada. The program is made up of education, a period of time in which candidates must meet relevant experience requirements, and at the end of the process they must take and pass the Common Final Examination. The program meets or surpasses all International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) standards for practical experience and education plus it meets the requirements of the main international accounting certification bodies.  Exemptions  CPA Canada recognizes many post-secondary institutions (PSIs) and accredit them to deliver part or all of its educations requirements from preparatory courses and Professional Education Program (PEP) in the undergrad and graduate levels. These accredited programs feature courses provided through a combination of undergraduate and graduate programs that result in either a graduate diploma or master's degree, such as University of Waterloo School of Accounting and Finance and Brock University's Goodman School of Business offer the Master of Accounting (MAcc) program that waive all the modules and education requirements up until the Common Final Examination.  President and CEO  Joy Thomas, FCPA, FCMA became president and CEO of CPA Canada on April 1, 2016. Thomas had held the position of executive vice president until then. She was a participant in the process that united Canada's accounting profession under one designation. Thomas was appointed to the National Steering Committee on Financial Literacy in February 2017. She is a board director and a member of the governance committee of the International Federation of Accountants. Thomas was also on the board and Chair of the Audit Committee of the Financial Planning Standards Board Ltd. After 4 years of service at CPA Canada, Joy Thomas stepped down as President and CEO. The role is succeeded by Charles-Antoine St-Jean, FCPA, FCA, as President and CEO, effective July 20, 2020.

She attended schools in Wilson County, Texas, for the most part, and studied at the University of Texas at Austin for several years. As a suffragist, she published many columns in local newspapers in support of that cause, as well as others. She was a member of numerous organizations. In 1927, she campaigned for Dan Moody and would be appointed as the Secretary of State after his successful election as governor. After leaving the position in 1933, she remained active in writing, activism, and political and civic affairs until her death in 1957.  Early life  Jane Yelvington was born December 30, 1877 in La Vernia, Texas. Her father, Alvaro Leonard Yelvington, was a county pioneer sheriff, and her mother was Mary Fullerton LeGette. Throughout her childhood, she attended county schools but also briefly attended a college in Mississippi from 1892-1893. In 1896, at age 18, she married Arthur McCallum, and after a series of moves, they settled in Austin, where he became school superintendent, by 1903. She attended the University of Texas at Austin for several years as one of the first mothers to attend the university, first from 1912-1915 and then from 1923-1924, though she did not receive a degree. While there, she joined Alpha Delta Pi and became the first married woman to join a sorority on that campus.  Campaigner for suffrage  Early on, McCallum became active in the movement for women's suffrage, as well as several other causes. At first, she convinced the owner of The Austin American (as of then not merged with The Statesman) to publish \\"Suffrage Corner,\\" her column of constant editorials against the movement's opposition. She then joined the staff of The Statesman and worked there through World War I, publishing support for Prohibition in opposition to the newspaper's editor. By the end of the war, she had led the Austin women's effort to fundraise $700,000 as women's chairman of the fourth Liberty bond drive. McCallum was elected president of the Austin Women Suffrage Association in 1915. She was also active in the Texas Equal Suffrage Association (TESA). Despite opposition, she gave speeches and wrote newspaper articles in support of women's right to vote, while raising five children. In August 1917, McCallum and other organizers created a public demonstration against Governor James E. Ferguson. Both male and female protestors spoke for 16 hours, including McCallum, who called him the \\"implacable foe of woman suffrage and of every great moral issue for which women stood.\\" The protest was timed to reach many of his supporters, in town for a farming conference, and contributed to a turn in general opinion of Ferguson and to his eventual resignation. McCallum was on site in 1918 when Governor William P. Hobby signed a bill into law which allowed Texas women to vote in primary elections. After 1920, when women were able to vote, she became active in the Texas League of Women Voters. For the Texas amendment on primaries, she served as the state publicity and press manager, and for the Nineteenth Amendment, she served as the state chairman of its ratification committee. She was part of the \\"Petticoat Lobby,\\" which worked to represent women's clubs and women's issues in the state. Throughout the 1920s, they pushed for legislation on \\"school funding, prison reform, maternal/infant health care, restrictions on child labor, stricter prohibition laws,\\" most of which was enacted.  Texas Secretary of State  In 1926, McCallum campaigned for then-attorney general Dan Moody's run for state governor, hosting the campaign headquarters in her own home. She and her colleagues hired a secretary, and they sent \\"letters, editorials, and pamphlets\\" to Texas women asking them to vote for Moody, who would later win the election against incumbent Miriam A. Ferguson, wife of former governor James E. Ferguson who had been attempting to win back control of the office under his wife's name. McCallum was first appointed to the position of Secretary of State in January 1927 by Governor Dan Moody. The next Governor, Ross S. Sterling, kept her on in the position, and she continued serving until 1933. While serving in this office, she discovered an original copy of the Texas Declaration of Independence in a vault and published a book, Women Pioneers, on the lives of early American women leaders. As in her earlier activism, she supported legislation on Prohibition, prison reform, and child labor, and she published a pamphlet criticizing former Governor Miriam A. Ferguson's numerous pardons of prisoners.  Later activism  Throughout her life, McCallum remained involved in politics and civic matters, giving speeches and making appearances in public and on the radio. She continued to publish her column, now called \\"Woman and Her Ways,\\" in the Austin American- Statesman until the late 1940s. During the 1940 presidential election, she served as an elector; in 1942 and 1944, she served as a state Democratic committeewoman, first for the Twentieth Senatorial District and then for the Tenth United States Congressional District. She was appointed to Austin's first city planning commission that same year, and the next January, in 1945, she protested with and led the Women's Committee on Educational Freedom to the state capitol, protesting the firing of her alma mater's president Homer Rainey after his opposition to the dismissal of faculty accused of being communists. In 1954, she became the first female commissioner of a Travis County Grand Jury after women won the right to serve on juries.  Death and legacy  McCallum died August 14, 1957 and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, in Austin. In 1989, her diaries and writing were compiled by Janet G. Humphrey in a book called A Texas Suffragist: Diaries and Writing of Jane Y. McCallum which collected her thoughts and activities as an activist and politician. Her diaries were later purchased by the University of Texas at Austin in 1990.  Publications   References   External links  * Jane Y.

He is the son of Chilean painter Roberto Matta and Italian actress Angela Faranda. His surname stems from a clerical error in the civil registry office, which was eventually corrected, but Echaurren continued to use the name professionally.  Career  He started to paint at the age of 18, inspired by the Roman artist Gianfranco Baruchello, and was discovered by the critic and gallerist Arturo Schwarz, who promoted his work in Italy and abroad. Between 1971 and 1975 he exhibited in Berlin, Basel, Philadelphia, Zurich, New York and Brussels and in 1975 he was invited to show at the Paris Biennale. His exhibition held at the Schwarz Gallery in Milan in 1974, was presented by Henry Martin, an American art critic and curator who has been writing about Fluxus for almost three decades.Henry Martin, \\"Miniatures,\\" in Pablo Echaurren, catalogue of the exhibition at the Galleria Schwarz, Milan, February 5 - March 30, 1974 (Milan: Galleria Schwarz, 1974), pp. 6-8. In 1974 he held two solo exhibitions in the USA: in Philadelphia at the Marian Locks Gallery and in New York at the Robert Stefanotty Gallery. His output at the beginning of his career was along minimalist lines, characterized by a conceptual approach and a rejection of pictorial conventions, offering an alternative to the idea of the work of art as fetish. Child of an age in which art and political commitment were often associated, he played an active part in the movement of so-called indiani metropolitani (metropolitan Indians), a section of the far left that in 1977 adopted the aesthetic languages of the artistic avant-garde.Claudia Salaris, \\"Biography, \\" in Pablo Echaurren. Contropittura, catalogue of the exhibition at Galleria nazionale d'arte moderna e contemporanea, Rome, November 20, 2015 - April 2, 2016, (Milan: Silvana Editoriale, 2015), p. 233. Echaurren has also produced illustrations, posters and book covers, including that of the best seller Porci con le ali, as well as ‚Äúmetacomics‚Äù. He has also published novels and pamphlets on the world of art. Since 1997 he is member of the National Academy of San Luca. In 2010 he founded the Fondazione Echaurren Salaris with his wife, Claudia Salaris, an avant-garde historian. Since 2012 he is a blogger for The Huffington Post. On March 26, 2018, Jacopo Galimberti, University of Manchester, held the lecture The Worker, the Militant and the Monster at the Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim√≤, New York University. The lecture was focused on the visualization of the novel political subjectivities that emerged in 1960s and 1970s Italy. The third and final part was devoted to the drawings of Pablo Echaurren that were published in Lotta Continua in 1977. On April 24, 2018, at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Mary Ann Caws, Thierry de Duve, David Joselit, Sophie Seita and Elizabeth Zuba conversed in an evening inspired by Dada focusing on the 1917 New York magazine The Blind Man, curated by Marcel Duchamp, Henri-Pierre Roch√© and Beatrice Wood, recently republished in facsimile edition by the Ugly Duckling Presse. Mary Ann Caws, Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature, English and French at the Graduate School of the City University of New York, started from impressions received in 2017, during the visit to Pablo Echaurren's exhibition Du champ magn√©tique. Works 1977-2017, held at the Scala Contarini del Bovolo, Venice, to highlight the seminal value of one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century. He recently participated in two exhibitions-tribute to Marcel Duchamp held at the Francis Naumann Fine Art in New York: Marcel Duchamp. An homage (2017) and Depicting Duchamp (2020).  Exhibitions  In 2013 the Beinecke Library, Yale University, bought a collection of his documents and drawings related to his work in Counterculture and the Movement of ‚Äô77.\\"What Pablo is working out here, through endless trial-and-error variations in his own inimitable style, is a conception of art as direct and active engagement in this struggles (and pleasures) of everyday life that played an immensely important role in the intertwined histories of the postwar avant-garde and the culture of protest as it emerged after 1945.\\"Kevin Repp (Curator, Modern European Books & Manuscripts, Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, New Haven, CT), \\"Message in a battle: Pablo Echaurren and the restless spirit of '77,\\" in Pablo Echaurren.

It is a common pathogen in neutropenic hosts, in whom it may spread through the bloodstream to peripheral organs. For invasive disease, treatments include amphotericin B, echinocandins, or extended-spectrum triazole antifungals. History and taxonomy In the history of fungi, the name of genus Candida, derived from the family Debaryomycetaceae, comes from the Latin term \\"\\" which has the meaning of ‚Äúglowing white‚Äù and also refers to as smooth and glistering. Genus Candida referred to any asexual yeast without any of the following characteristics: production of acetic acid, pigments of colours red, pink or orange, arthroconidia, unipolar or bipolar budding, enteroblastic-basipetal budding, blastoconidia formation on sympodulae, buds formation on stalks, triangular cells, needle-shaped terminal conidia, and having the ability to grow on inositol as a sole carbon source. Although there are 200 species identified in this genus, the taxonomy remains undefined and incomplete due to several reasons such as changing the words for some representations, the finding of new species and the reclassification of identified old species. This genus no longer includes species that test positive to diazonium blue B (DBB). The defunct genera Oidium and Monilia were used to represent the genus Candida. In the genus Candida, there are other species that are synonym of Candida tropicalis. Candida albicans is taxonomically close to C. tropicalis sharing many pathogenic traits whereas C. maltosa and C. sake are physiologically similar to C. tropicalis but they can be differentiated by the growth at 35 ¬∞C (only C. sake showing negative) and assimilation of soluble starch (only C. tropicalis showing positive starch assimilation). Identification C. tropicalis is easily identified using phenotypic and molecular methods. The identification of species in the genus Candida relies on morphological and physiological features. Species in the genus are vegetative cells which reproduce asexually by budding, and the structure, shape, septation, color and arrangement of buds is useful for identification. The production and appearance of pseudohyphae and blastoconidia may also be useful for identification. Physiological profiles relating to carbon and nitrogen utilization are of value in determining species, as are the presence certain distinctive biochemical features. Increasingly, molecular genetic methods such as DNA sequencing are used as primary tools for the accurate determination of species identifications in this group. Growth and morphology Colony of C. tropicalis on a Petri dish.C. tropicalis is a vegetative cell with the shape from round to oval ranging from approximately 2 ‚Äì 10 micrometers. A mould exhibits dimorphism forming a single-celled yeast or so-called blastoconidia which reproduces by simple budding„Ñ° Conidia is the asexual unit that are produced by budding of the tips or walls of the hyphae. Conidia is a type of simple and unicellular body that could take the form of multicellular cell with different shapes, sizes, and colors. Microconidia is used to refer to small and unicellular conidia whereas macroconidia refers to large and multicellular conidia. There are different media on which C. tropicalis can grow effectively. A common medium used is the Sabouraud‚Äôs agar which contains peptone and sugar. This is enough for identifying the species but with a disadvantage of promoting mycelial growth and suppressing conidia formation. Another commonly used medium is the cornmeal agar which is useful in inducing formation of conidia. Potato-glucose, potato-carrot, tomato juice, lima bean and others are also types of media used for growth. The optimal temperature for growth is between and growth is enhanced if sugar or fat is added in the medium. Colony of C. tropicalis are white, smooth and butyrous with a fringed border. Physiology C. tropicalis reproduces asexually by the production of blastoconidia through budding. As blastoconidia increase in number they may elongate in shape producing structures called the pseudohyphae. Under specific conditions of reduced oxygen level in host tissues, submerged colonies in agar medium, or in the presence of 5-10% CO2, true, septate hyphae may form.

Once there's a compatible substrate, urease will split urea to produce ammonia increasing the pH. C. tropicalis is found to be urease negative. =Diazonium Blue B Test= This test uses the azo dye, diazonium blue B which differentially stains cells from species affiliated with the Division, Basidiomycota. For C. tropicalis, this test is negative. Parasexuality C. tropicalis diploid cells of opposite mating type can mate to form tetraploid cells. These cells may then undergo chromosome loss during long-term propagation in rich medium resulting in the eventual regeneration of diploid cells.Seervai RN, Jones SK Jr, Hirakawa MP, Porman AM, Bennett RJ. Parasexuality and ploidy change in Candida tropicalis. Eukaryot Cell. 2013 Dec;12(12):1629-40. doi: 10.1128/EC.00128-13. PMID: 24123269 Such diploid cells are again mating competent thus completing a parasexual cycle. Opaque C. tropicalis cells can also form an architecturally complex sexual biofilm.Jones SK Jr, Hirakawa MP, Bennett RJ. Sexual biofilm formation in Candida tropicalis opaque cells. Mol Microbiol. 2014 Apr;92(2):383-98. doi: 10.1111/mmi.12565. PMID: 24612417 Habitat and ecology Candida species are very pervasive yeasts that are distributed worldwide geographically. They are more likely to be found in tropical climate where temperature and humidity will enhance the adaptability of C. tropicalis. They can be found in food such as sauerkraut, molasses, miso, fruit, baker‚Äôs yeast and some fruits. They are commonly found on plants and in the digestive system of mammals, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, and in the mucocutaneous membranes of humans. C. tropicalis is considered as an osmotolerant yeast; microorganisms that are able to survive in high salt concentration and able to develop fungal persistence in saline environments. Storage and transportation The selection of medium for sample growth is very important accounting for the pros and cons of each type of growth medium. Once decided on the medium, need to add 8 ug of fluconazole per mL to limit bacterial growth and contamination. When the medium is ready, it is optional to add supplement to help and optimize specimen growth. After the growth, features examination including shape, size, bud arrangement, cell wall thickness, temperature of growth, pseudohyphae presence, arthroconidia presence, and capsule presence are all important to take into account. If the species are grown using any type of the medium mentioned, the transportation of specimens for testing should be completed in less than two hours. If there is any delay, the samples should be stored at 37 ¬∞C with the exception of contaminated specimens that need be stored in 4 ¬∞C. Pathogenicity In tropical countries, C. tropicalis is one of the most common colonizer and pathogen causing human disease, especially found on human skin, in the gastrointestinal tract and also in female genitourinary tract. It can be transmitted between health-care workers and patients, especially in environments such as hospitals. C. tropicalis can survive for up to 24 hours therefore be cross-transmitted to a second hand with a probability of 69% and to a third hand with 38% probability. It is the cause responsible for approximately half of the beyond-surface candida infections. C. tropicalis is the second most virulent Candida species that can significantly affect by spreading through the weakened immune system host and can occupy the gastrointestinal tract within 30 minutes of inoculation, all this resulting in increased mortality. Impact of candidiasis, infections cause by C. tropicalis, have increased globally. C. tropicalis is virulent due to its ability to produce biofilm, secrete lytic enzymes, adhere to epithelial and endothelial cells, and undergo transition of bud to hyphae. Biofilms are complex structures that are formed from the grouping of microorganisms on a local surface, either biotic or abiotic, dependent on the ability of cellular adhesion to substrates. For C. tropicalis to fully enter and cause infection in the host, it needs some helpers. First, once it is attached onto the host tissues, extracellular enzymes called the proteases will be produced to facilitate the penetration of the pathogen and allow it to interfere with the host defense system. proteases will hydrolyze peptide bonds; secreted aspartic proteases (SAP) support C. tropicalis to be attached and penetrate deep into the tissues to affect the organs. phospholipases will hydrolyze phospholipid; assist to break the epithelial cell membrane structure allowing the hyphal tip to enter into the cytoplasm. Many conditions that contribute to C. tropicalis survival and colonization are: a) increase the use of antifungal regimen, b) increased number of immunocompromised patients, c) long-term use of catheters, and d) use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although different tests are able to use for identification of species, each of the tests will have different limitations such as sensitivity, specificity, cost and equipment availability. Human diseases Types of disease caused by C. tropicalis will vary depending on the location where the species colonizes. With an infection in the mucous membrane, subject will experience oropharyngeal candidiasis, angular cheilitis  angular cheilitis , balanoposthitis, oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis. Although provided with oral cavity defenses such as epithelial cells, saliva, salivary immunoglobin (IgA), lysozyme, lactoferrin, histidine-rich polypeptide and lactoperoxidase to suppress C. tropicalis‚Äô overgrowth, C. tropicalis is reported to secrete additional products that can preferably target onto T-cell deficient host. C. tropicalis is a normal flora which is found on the skin and nails on approximately 10% of the patients. Superficial and localized mucosal infections are mostly reported with a higher risk factor when combined with other diseases found in a patient. Patients with C. tropicalis infections are also seen with denture, HIV infection or irradiation for malignancies. 38% of AIDS patients with recurrent disease are more likely to get infected by C. tropicalis, getting oral thrush and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Only filamentous growth of C. tropicalis have the ability to invade and colonize orally in the epithelium, commonly seen in cancer patients and higher risk for someone who subsequently develops disseminated invasive disease. Candiduria is referred to as urinary tract infections caused by C. tropicalis which are often presented as nosocomial infections. Although up to 2% of patients are asymptomatic, those with diabetes mellitus and with leukemia are more likely to be infected. If an infection involves interdigital candidiasis, paronychia and diaper rash, subject is likely to have cutaneous candidiasis. Otherwise, if an infection involves body fluid and internal organs damages, subject will experience pulmonary candidiasis, invasive and disseminated candidiasis, gastrointestinal candidiasis and candidemia. C. tropicalis colonization is favoured in the gastrointestinal tract; a common risk factor for individuals that are susceptible for invasive candidiasis development. Candidemia is a worldwide bloodstream disease mainly affecting peripheral organs in humans. Usually, candidemia caused by C. tropicalis are associated with cancer patients that have either leukemia or neutropenia. According to the data obtained from 2010, frequency of candidemia is 12-25% in the US, 4.5-9% in Europe, 20-24% in Brazil and 20-60% in South Asia. C. tropicalis can cause nosocomial fungal bloodstream infections along with C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. Mortality rate of invasive and disseminated infections caused by C. tropicalis is high, ranging from 40% to 70%. Risk factors that contribute to the high rate are leukemia, anti-neoplastic chemotherapy, previous neutropenia, central venous catheters, long stay on intensive care and total parenteral nutrition. Although children infections are not as common seen as in adults, leukemia, secondary neutropenia and bone marrow transplantation are factors favouring C. tropicalis infections. Another infection seen commonly in patients who have leukemia and secondary neutropenia, is chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC) is another type of disseminated candida infection that mainly develops in the liver, spleen and kidney. Treatment and prevention The most important and most essential step to prevent contact with the fungi species is by washing the hands. There are several types of therapy for the different level of infections caused by C. tropicalis. Normally, antifungal agents are used to treat these infections. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is the most common treatment antifungal agent used to treat Candida infections. Topical antifungal agents are commonly taken in 3 forms: oral suspension, ointment and powder. Oral suspension is mainly used to treat thrush whereas ointment is directly applied onto the infected section. Nystatin is a type of antifungal agent used because it is not absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. These types of agents will function to lower candida species‚Äô phospholipases activities. Flucytosine (5FC) is another type of therapy treatment including 3 agents used; caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin. Usage of caspofungin will efficiently target against oropharyngeal and oesophgeal candidiasis and invasive candidiasis. Micafungin, compared to amphotericin B, it is more efficient. Anidulafungin results are similar to Caspofungin and Micafungin. echinocandin are a type of non-competitive inhibitors of cell wall 1,3-b-D- glucan synthase complex mainly used to treat fungal infections. Azoles are agents that can deplete ergosterol, the main component of the fungus cell wall membrane, in order to inhibit fungal growth. fluconazole is water-soluble, ready to be taken orally. C. tropicalis can rapidly develop resistance towards fluconazole therefore it's not recommended to retreat fluconazole-treated patients with recurrent candidiasis. Other azoles that are highly active against C. tropicalis are itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole and isavuconazole. Voriconazole is a new generation from fluconazole with a higher potential of broad spectrum activity. All of the mentioned treatments and drug therapies can also be applied onto neonates and premature newborns taking into account the amount of recommended dose. Although there are several ways to treat the different types of C. tropicalis‚Äô infections, the best way to improve treatments results is to improve host immune system.

Education  Goldberg graduated from Elam School of Fine Arts in 1961 with honours and awarded the Joe Raynes Scholarship in her final year. At Elam, she studied alongside Don Binney, Michael Smither, Lynley Dodd, Greer Twiss, Malcolm Warr, and Graham Percy. In 1965 she received a Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council Grant which allowed her to travel to the United Kingdom and attend the Hornsey College of Art.  Career  Goldberg's paintings combined approaches to abstract and representational art. She experimented with painting techniques and effects including washing paint off with turpentine; a process called decalcomania (also used by the Surrealists), in which paper is used to apply paint by taking impressions from paint layered on board. Known for landscapes of New Zealand, Goldberg has also painted portraits. Well known works include Landscape (1964), Life (1960) and BDG No 1 (1969). Her paintings of birds were featured in James McNeish's book An Albatross Too Many.  Exhibitions  In 1961, Goldberg exhibited with The Group, an informal art association from Christchurch, New Zealand, that formed to provide a freer alternative to the Canterbury Society of Arts. Goldberg's first solo show was in 1962, an exhibition entitled \\"Two New Names\\" (also exhibiting with Pat Hanly). In 1963, three of her paintings were included in the Auckland City Art Gallery's Contemporary New Zealand Painting exhibition. She was one of fifteen New Zealand artists to have their work selected for the 1965 Commonwealth exhibition in London. Goldberg also exhibited at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o TƒÅmaki. In 1999 the Dowse Museum, in Lower Hutt, hosted a major retrospective of Goldberg's art. Fellow artist Barry Lett promoted her work, including her in exhibitions at the Barry Lett Galleries.  Collections  Several different places have kept designs that she made. Pieces by Goldberg are owned by the University of Auckland, Victoria University of Wellington, the Ford Motor Company and New Zealand consulates in Washington, Tokyo, New York and Canberra.

She was one of the most successful women contractors in the United States during the early 1920s. Early life Ada Bell Harper Maescher was born on January 24, 1868 in Ripley County, Indiana, the daughter of Dr. William R. Harper (1825‚Äì1886) and Luvicy Hughes (1827‚Äì1902). Career Maescher published five books on building industry and was founder, and for seventeen years president, of the De Luxe Building Company, a home building and architecture design firm. She was among United States' most successful women contractors during the early 1920s. At the beginning of the 20th century, the De Luxe Building Co. used trade catalogs to propose different option to potential buyers like: \\"Kozy-homes\\", a selection of artistic little houses designed to meet the demands of those seeking plans for economical homes with the maximum convenience, and \\"Plan- kraft\\", homes for progressive people who wish to build homes that were different, Swiss chalets and Japanese architectures. Ada Bell Maescher, Moving Picture World Jun 1922 In 1922, Maescher organized the De Luxe Film Company to produce a propaganda picture, Night Life in Hollywood, which would show the \\"real\\" living conditions in the film capital. Instead of depicting Hollywood as a lurid, sensual Babylon, with its reported debauches of depravity and wickedness, it was shown as a model city, beautiful and attractive, and populated with home-loving people. The film cost approximately $100,000 ($ in today's money). She then planned the Los Angeles permanent grand opera; as first step toward this target she financed the presentation of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida which was given at the Hollywood Bowl in 1923. Personal life Maescher moved to California in 1906 and lived at 4652 Mascot St., Los Angeles, California. She married Victor Emanuel Maescher (1874‚Äì1938) and had one daughter, Roxye Mae Thompson Paddison (1887‚Äì1972). She was interested in Nature and Preservation of Bird Life, and was a member of the Southern California Nature Club, Audubon Society, and Cooper Ornithological Club. She died on September 2, 1939, and was buried with her husband at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale).

It is part of the Central Victoria zone and roughly corresponds to the Goulburn Valley tourist and government region. The first vineyards and winery were established in the Goulburn Valley in 1860. Tahbilk was the original winery, and still produces some wine from vines planted in the 1860s. The Australian Geographical Indication \\"Goulburn Valley\\" has been protected since 29 November 1999. Tahbilk was founded by a syndicate which raised ¬£25,000 to develop the winery. By 1875 trade with England had been established, and the winery was producing the equivalent of 70,000 cases of wine per year. Due to the sandy soil, Tahbilk was able to withstand the spread of Phylloxera, and in 1925 was the only winery in the area. As a result, the region is home to the oldest and largest plantings of Marsanne grape variety in the world. Other wine varieties grown include Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Riesling and Shiraz. As well as Tahbilk, other major wineries include Michelton between Seymour and Nagambie, Wine by Sam, Fowles Wines and boutique vinyards Box Grove and Brave Goose vineyard in the south near Seymour and Monichino near Katunga in the north. Nagambie Lakes is a recognised and protected subregion of the Goulburn Valley wine region. Each year Tastes of the Goulburn food and wine festival is hosted in Seymour, showcasing the best local produce from the Goulburn Valley. Seymour also hosts the Victorian Wine Show.

The Nagambie Lakes subregion surrounds the town of Nagambie and the artificial Lake Nagambie. Goulburn Valley wine region is roughly triangular.

It is marketed as the \\"fourth\\" type of chocolate alongside dark, milk, and white chocolate varieties and is notable for its natural pink colour. The chocolate is characterized by a taste that has been described as slightly sweet and sour, which is comparable to that of berries, as the chocolate's main characteristic is its acidity.Kwil, I., & Podsiad≈Çy, K. (2019). Innovations in the Chocolate Manufacture as Part of Polish Confectionery Industry. Wroc≈Çaw University of Economics. In a comparison of the phenolic content between varieties of chocolate, ruby chocolate was rated between milk and white chocolate. According to standards set by the Food and Drug Administration, ruby chocolate must contain a minimum of 1.5% nonfat cacao solids and a minimum of 20% by weight of cacao fat. It may contain antioxidants, spices, and other natural and artificial flavorings; however, these ingredients cannot mimic the flavours of chocolate, milk, butter, or a fruit, and it cannot contain additional colouring.Schiller, L.J.

The chocolate is made from \\"ruby cocoa beans\\". These are existing botanical cocoa bean varieties that have been identified as having the right attributes to be processed into ruby chocolate. While the exact production method is a trade secret, publications note industry speculation is that ruby chocolate is made with unfermented cocoa beans of Brazil Lavados, which can have a natural red-pink colour. Barry Callebaut registered a patent in 2009 for \\"cocoa- derived material\\" from unfermented cocoa beans (or beans fermented for no more than three days) that become red or purple after treating them with an acid, such as citric acid, and then defatting with petroleum ether. It has been debated by chocolate experts whether ruby chocolate constitutes a new variety of chocolate or if it is a marketing strategy. Kennedy's Confection magazine editor Angus Kennedy disputes that ruby chocolate is a new fourth variety and compared the taste to a combination of white chocolate and raspberries. The public interest of the chocolate variety has been linked to the popularity of the colour pink in marketing and on social media in the 2010s, a phenomenon that is referred to as \\"millennial pink\\".Bideaux, K. (2018). Millennial pink: From iPhone to Rihanna. Proceedings from the Conferenza del Colore.

Early life and education  Grinton was the son of Edwin Robertson and M. Helen (Ingham) Will. Will's grandfather John H. Will immigrated to the United States from Bonn, Germany in 1848. His father, Edwin Will, studied architecture at the City College of New York and Cooper Union before working at an architectural firm. His mother, M. Helen Ingham, studied at Hunter College and then became a teacher in New York City. Will's brother Robert was born in 1909. Will grew up in Mamaroneck and attended the Rye Neck public schools. He then attended Wesleyan University where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree. He became a librarian at the Mamaroneck Public Library in 1922. He worked at the Mamaroneck Public Library for ten years and became its library director. In 1930, Will became a language instructor and librarian at the Connecticut Agricultural College. During that same year, he earned a certificate of library science from the Columbia University School of Library Science. He additionally taught public library administration at the Pratt Institute Library School. On November 15, 1933, he was hired to work as the library director of the Yonkers Public Library.  Yonkers Public Library  Under Will's direction, three branches of the Yonkers Public Library were built. These were the Coyne Park Branch, the Hudson Museum River Branch, and the Grassy Sprain Branch, which would later become known as the Grinton I. Will Library. Though already built, the Crestwood Library Branch building was enlarged. Bookmobiles were inaugurated by Will to provide library service to Yonkers residents who were not close to a library branch. With this service, Mr. Will hoped to provide library service to every part of Yonkers. This helped increase the circulation of materials. On December 19, 1961, a celebration was held for the one millionth book circulated. According to Grinton I. WIll, by the time of his retirement in 1973, the Yonkers Public Library was the highest circulating library of its group (cities with a population between 100,000 and 250,000 people). Grinton was contacted by United States State Department about the possibility of using bookmobiles in Asia after World War Two. Though discussed, the plan was never implemented. Various programs were held at the Yonkers Public Library while Will was the director. These included a mock radio broadcast with Stan Z. Burns from 1010 WINS, a concert with National Symphony musicians Daniel Domb and Sidney Moore, a production of The Wizard of Oz, and doll story times. Grinton I. Will retired from the Yonkers Public Library on May 1, 1973 at the age of 70.  Professional Affiliations  Besides working as a library director, Grinton I. Will served as a deputy director of the Westchester Library System, a board member for the New York Library Association, and became the director of the American Library Association in 1955. He was given an honorary life membership to the Mamaroneck Public Library.  Community work  Grinton I. Will belonged to the Westchester County History Society, the New York State Historical Society, and was vice-president of the Yonkers Historical Society. He was involved with various Yonkers community organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of America troop in Yonkers. Additionally, Will was the president of the Yonkers Rotary Club, deputy director of Civil Defense in Yonkers, member of the Red Cross in Yonkers, and member of the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce.  Music interest  Will was a guest conductor for both the Larchmont and Mamaroneck choral societies. He wrote original lyrics and music for choral compositions. These include \\"Through the Night a Starry Way\\" and \\"Lord, O Lord, Look Down Upon Us.\\" These songs were published by H.W. Gray Publications in 1928. He was an organist and choir director of churches in Yonkers, including the Bryn Mawr Park Presbyterian Church and the Calvary Baptist Church. As a pianist, he published several pieces including Christmas carols.  Marriage  Grinton married Clarissa Lord on March 14, 1931 at St. Bartholomew's Church in Manhattan.

He was the 11th ruler of Wey and the first Duke of Wey. The late Zhou dynasty historical record Guoyu claims that Duke Wu lived as long as 95 years. However, no other sources support this claim.  Life  The Records of the Grand Historian briefly noted that He succeeded his father Marquis Xi of Wey, the title was Marquis at the beginning of his rule. When Quanrong overthrown Zhou's rule in Haojing, King Ping of Zhou relocated the capital to Luoyi. Duke Wu aided Zhou by leading his army and confronting with Quanrong. The military merit of Marquis He was recognized by King Ping. The king elevated his rank of nobility to Duke accordingly. He died after 55 years of his rule. His son Duke Zhuang of Wey succeeded him. Duke Wu's shrine was located in Qi county of Henan Province where the shrine of Shu Feng of Kang can also be found.  Relation with Bo He of Gong  Bo He of Gong was a figure mentioned by numerous inscriptions as well as other historical sources. However, his identification is not clearly known. The Records of the Grand Historian and the Bamboo Annals both recorded that Bo He exiled King Li of Zhou who was carrying out his reign of terror. Contemporary Chinese historian Gu Jiegang speculate that Duke Wu of Wey was the one who exiled King Li of Zhou in 841 BCE. Duke Wu's name was He, So was the name of Bo He of Gong.  In Literature  In the earliest collection of Chinese poetry Shih-ching, an ode dedicated to Duke Wu can be found. In the Gu√≥ fƒìng part of Shih Ching, the ode Qi Ao (Ê∑áÂ•ß) praised Duke Wu for his tolerance of different opinions, his unfaltering desire of learning and his refrain from the abuse of power. In the comment of this ode, the author, like Gu Jiegang, also claimed that Duke Wu was in charge of Zhou dynasty's court at a certain point of time.Classic of Poetry, Guo Feng, Wey, Qi Ao. This ode was so well known that one of the frase \\"Â¶ÇÂàáÂ¶ÇÁ£ãÔºåÂ¶ÇÁê¢Â¶ÇÁ£®\\"(Ruqie Rucuo, Ruzhuo Rumo) entered into the common lexicon of Mandarin Chinese. The word \\"Qie Cuo\\"(ÂàáÁ£ã) in Mandarin means \\"To Practice\\", The word Zhuo Mo (Áê¢Á£®) means \\"To contemplate\\". If Shih Ching and Gu Jiegang were both true in their claim, the word \\"Republic/Republican\\" in Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese \\"ÂÖ±Âíå\\" also traces its origin to Duke Wu of Wey. Additionally, the Minor court Hymns of Shih Ching collected one of Duke Wu's own work. Duke Wu composed the hymn of Bin Zhi Chuyan in order to satirize King You of Zhou's decadent way of life. In the Major court hymns, the hymn of Yi(Êäë,Refrain), was Duke Wu's production as well. In Yi, he solicited King Ping of Zhou for his prudence in ruling a country.

Description Vigna hosei is a twining or creeping legume, often forming a thick ground cover. Its leaflets are ovate to elliptic, with thin, long hairs on both sides. The terminal leaflet is by . The pod is long, black, and generally containing one to three seeds. Its flowers are yellow and by . The pedicel is long and expands as the pod matures. The bracteoles are long and 1-nerved, and the calyx is slightly pubescent. Besides producing normal flowers and pods, Vigna hosei also produces some flowers which remain concealed under a thick carpet of half-decayed leaves, originating from the plant itself, and which are set on a long pale stalk. These other flowers in a ripe state are very yellow, finely and quite densely pubescent, and have one to two seeds. They are generally long. Habitat and ecology Vigna hosei is native to Taiwan, Indonesia, and Malaysia in tropical southeast Asia. It is also widely cultivated and has become naturalized in tropical Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Madagascar), Australia, the US states of Florida and Hawaii, and in the Caribbean.Mar√©chal et al. 1978, Pasquet 2001, USDA, ARS, National Genetic Resources Program 2013 It often forms thick ground cover and is found in grass at roadsides and in disturbed habitats or wastelands, on damp ground and on sandy loam from above sea level in Africa and anywhere under above sea level in southeast Asia. It requires of annual rainfall, and due to its shallow root system it can withstand flooding but not drought. One of its most outstanding characteristics is its persistence under shade, but full sunlight is required for good seed production. It can grow in a wide range of soils but prefers acidic soils of pH 4.9 or less. As a cover crop, Vigna hosei is susceptible to the fungus disease Rhizoctonia solani, which causes wilting of large patches of leaves. Wet weather favors the spread of the disease. Vigna hosei is also one of many plants able to be infected by the cucumber mosaic virus. Uses Vigna hosei is used as a green manure and ground cover crop in young tree plantations as well as in rubber, tea, and coconut plantations. Its seedling growth is vigorous, and young plants quickly suppress weed growth, forming a thick mat of growth with a dense leaf litter, which protects the soil from erosion and prevents the ingress of weeds. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen enriches the soil and promotes the growth of the trees. Due to its persistence under shade, the plant can enrich a mixture of leguminous covers for young plantation trees. It is also used as an animal forage and is tolerant to heavy grazing.

Early life Orsi was born and grew up in Chicago, Illinois. His passion for music began with the gift of a small radio from his grandmother. Orsi's father owned an Italian food and liquor store on 26th and Princeton streets on the city's south side. In the early 1960s the neighborhoods were razed en masse so that construction of the Dan Ryan Expressway could begin. The family moved the business (Orsi & Sons) to a new location at 59 East 18th street. The store was nearby Chicago's \\"Record Row\\" on South Michigan Avenue. Musicians from studios such as Chess Records would stop by at Orsi & Sons for lunch. Young Phil Orsi soon became friends with Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon. Early career Orsi started up his band Phil Orsi & The Little Kings in 1962. The original line-up consisted of John Jackson on horns, Clark Dufay on lead guitar, Steve Hamilton on drums and himself on bass guitar. They played many clubs, bars and halls in Chicago area and neighboring states. They recorded a number of singles on local Chicago labels such as USA Records.http://www.45cat.com/artist/phil-orsi 45cat.com The name of the band came from the comic strip \\"The Little King\\" created by Otto Soglow. The band wore patches of the character on their band jackets. The band's single \\"Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home)\\" was listed as one of Billboards \\"Spotlights\\" in August 1966. The following year, the group recorded a Larry Nestor song \\"Loving on Borrowed Time\\" for the Wise World Record label, that Orsi founded with Otis Clay. The single became a Northern Soul favorite in British dance clubs. Orsi met band manager and booking agent Carl Bonafede at the Vogue Ballroom in Chicago when Bonafede was first managing the Fabulous Centuries whose band members included Carl Giammarese and Nick Fortuna. Orsi later had a band called the Uni-beats' and recorded singles on local Chicago labels like Scarlott Records. Later on he became part of local act The Thunderbirds. The group had releases on The Delaware and Ivanhoe labels which were subdivisions of Mercury Records a Chicago- based recording label. The Thunderbirds (from Chicago) had a line-up of John Russo on drums, Coy Lowehorne on lead guitar, Ken Hoffman on keyboards, Cal Clemons on horns and Orsi on bass guitar.

In 2017, IRC had 66 staff members and 22 associates, and recorded a turnover of ‚Ç¨11.99 million.  History   Early years  In December 1968, under an agreement of the World Health Organization and the Government of the Netherlands, the WHO International Reference Center on Community Water Supply was established (abbreviated as IRC). IRC was then an annex of the Government Institute of Drinking Water Supply.First Annual Report, I.R.C, 1969, p.4 (Dutch: Rijksinstituut voor Drinkwatervoorziening, R.I.D, merged in RIVM in 1984). Apart from the relation with R.I.D, IRC established an advisory board that consisted of representatives of both national and international water supply sector organisations. In 1970, IRC drafted its first five-year plan with three main objectives: provide knowledge, coordinate research, and stimulate a systematic approach to solve problems in the drinking water supply industry. In 1972 IRC's chemical engineer B.C.J. Zoeteman concluded a 3-year research on the practicality of iodine and iodine components‚Äô disinfection in small water supplies with a research report,The suitability of iodine and iodine compounds as disinfectants for small water supplies, Zoeteman, B. C. (1972). which marked the initiation of IRC's Technical Paper (TP)series. In 1973, IRC held the \\"Bilthoven Meeting\\", joined by 31 international collaborating institutions. This meeting set working priorities for IRC such as developing appropriate water hygiene practices for better water supply quality. Consequently, follow-up projects were planned and initiated.  Gaining independence  In 1980, IRC became an independent foundation under the name International Reference Centre for Community Water Supply and Sanitation. (Abbreviated as IRC). In 1981, the IRC foundation was established through an Act of Dutch Parliament. Hans Van Damme became the Director of IRC, while Pier Santema became Chair of the newly constituted Governing Board. In the meantime, the United Nations launched the International Drinking Water Decade, 1981‚Äì90, which led to changes in the scope and strategies of IRC. Due to the UN‚Äôs initiative, IRC's role in international WASH knowledge dissemination was strengthened. In 1981, IRC published one of most popular books, Small Communities Water Supplies . Between 1983 and 1985, IRC published two major publications on Slow Sand Filtration. The one published in 1985 was further distributed to the WHO Regional Office for Europe and the WRC Research Centre. IRC introduced a focus on gender issues in water, hygiene and sanitation sectors and published several documents on this topic, led by the 1985 publication Participation of Women in Water Supply and Sanitation: Roles and Realities. From the 1980s onwards, IRC started to provide consulting and advisory services. In 1987, IRC undertook a number of assignments from DGIS, Commission of the European Economic Community, DANIDA, UNDP, World Bank, UNICEF and WHO. In 1988, IRC changed its name from \\"International Reference Centre for Community Water Supply and Sanitation\\" to \\"International Water and Sanitation Centre\\", the abbreviation \\"IRC\\" stayed the same however.  Years of change  In the foreword of IRC‚Äôs 1991 annual report it says: In 1990, at a consultation in New Delhi, IRC presented two hands-on experiences of WASH sector knowledge dissemination. During the 1991 Global Consultation on Safe Water and Sanitation for the 1990s held in New Delhi, \\"community management\\" was brought up and soon became one of the guiding principles in IRC's work. In the same year, IRC published its 28th technical paper, an approach to sustainable piped water supplies. By 1993, IRC possessed one of the \\"most comprehensive collections of low-cost water supply and sanitation literature\\" within the water sector.Twenty-fourth Annual Report, I.R.C, 1993, p.4 In the 1990s, along with knowledge dissemination, IRC delivered advisory and evaluation services and training courses Ibid. In 1994, IRC delivered its training courses in English, French and Spanish at its headquarter in The Netherlands and other locations such as Kenya, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Colombia and India. In 1996, after working for IRC for 27 years, Mr. Hans van Damme resigned from his position as director of IRC. In the same year, the Governing Board commissioned an external evaluation of IRC. The main suggestion that came out of the evaluation was that IRC should make a clear distinction between profitable products and information dissemination. Consequently, IRC defined its scope as \\"Better Water and Sanitation for a better Future\\", a new policy framework that was put forward in 1997. Changes in technology also influenced IRC's knowledge dissemination. In 1996, IRC set up an intranet system and a World Wide Web page. The IRC website recorded 42,000 clicks between year 1996 and 1997. An average of 3,500 per month. A new IRC Bulletin was published on the Internet as well. Stepping into the new millennium, IRC presented itself as a \\"capacity building\\" organisation to ensure \\"sustainable and economical\\" acquisition of WASH services for the world's poorest regions. After the second external evaluation in 2001, advocacy activities, institutional reforms and people-centred approaches were emphasised in IRC's daily operations. Thematic advocacy programmes witnessed a shift from water supply to policy issues, sanitation and hygiene, participatory methodologies and gender issues. In 2000, IRC supported the launch of the Gender and Water Alliance (GWA) and hosted the GWA Secretariat until 2005. Since the 1990s, IRC had worked with and supported WASH resource centre networks in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Honduras, Nepal and Uganda and documented their contribution to a learning and adaptive sector in 2013. IRC closed a number of long-term projects in 2002. Reorganisation, again, was put as a top priority. In 2006, IRC cut off the statutory link with the Netherlands government through an Act of Parliament, and became an autonomous foundation.  Systems Approach  In 2008, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded IRC two multi-year, multi-country grants for projects on live-cycling costing (WASHCost ) and models for sustainable rural water services (Triple-S ). These two projects were instrumental in the development of new IRC's Service Delivery Approach towards the development of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services that last not for years, but forever. Key to this approach is that it must be delivered by strong and competent national and local systems. In 2011, IRC ranked 4th in Philanthropedia's list of \\"most effective WASH organisations worldwide\\", and in 2015, IRC ranked 3rd in this list. In 2014, IRC changed its name from IRC International Water and Sanitation Centre to IRC with as tagline \\"Supporting water sanitation and hygiene services for life\\". In May 2015, Aguaconsult, IRC, WaterAid, Water For People and Osprey Foundation launched Agenda for Change. This collaborative initiative stems from Everyone Forever from Water For People, the Service Delivery Approach of IRC, the WaterAid District-wide Approach and the aid effectiveness agenda of the Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) partnership.  Organisation  IRC is a non-profit organisation registered in The Netherlands since 1980 as \\"Stichting IRC, International Water and Sanitation Centre\\". It has an oversight model of governance, consisting of a Supervisory Board and a Chief Executive Officer. IRC has its headquarters in The Hague, The Netherlands with country offices in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana and Uganda, and staff representatives in Honduras, India and the USA. In 2017, IRC had 66 staff members (29 in The Netherlands and 37 in country offices) and 22 associates. It was active in 86 projects and programmes, recording a turnover of ‚Ç¨11.99 million.  Memberships and Partnerships  IRC is a steering committee member of Sanitation and Water for All, End Water Poverty and the Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN), a founding member of the Water Integrity Network (WIN), a UN-Water partner, a member of the Millennium Water Alliance, the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council, the Netherlands Water Partnership and Partos  References   External links  * International water associations 1968 establishments in the Netherlands International organisations based in the Netherlands ","title":"IRC (organization)"},{"id":"55226007","text":"Hillslope evolution is the changes in the erosion rates, erosion styles and form of slopes of hills and mountains over time. Conceptual models During most of the 20th century three models of hillslope evolution were widely diffused: slope decline, slope replacement and parallel slope retreat. Until the 1950s models of hillslope form evolution were \\"central\\" in geomorphology. The modern understanding is that the evolution of slopes is much more complex than the classical models of decline, replacement and retreat imply. Slope decline Slope decline was proposed by William Morris Davis in his cycle of erosion theory. It consists of a gradual decrease in slope angle as stream incision slows down. This is accompaigned as slopes becomes more gentle they accumulate with fine-grained regolith stemming from weathering. Slope replacement Slope replacement first proposed by Walther Penck challenging Davis' ideas on slope development. Slope replacement describes an evolution of slopes that is associated with decreasing rates of over-all erosion (denudation). It begins with a flattening of the lowermost slope that propagates upward and backward making the uppermost slope recede and decrease its angle while it remains steeper than the lower portions. Parallel slope retreat Slopes evolve by parallel retreat when rock strength remains constant and basal debris, like talus, is continuously removed. These conditions are often met in areas where hard horizontal rock layers of basalt or hard sedimentary rock overlie softer rocks. Slopes tend to cease to evolve by parallel retreat once overlying hard layers covering softer rock have been fully eroded. As rock strength is related to weathering and weathering to climate in the case a slope retreat over large distances or over long time- spans retreat is unlikely to remain fully parallel. This is because climate changes over time and over long distances. Parallel slope and scarp retreat, albeit proposed by early geomorphologists, was notably championed by Lester Charles King. King considered scarp retreat and the coalescence of pediments into pediplains a dominant processes across the globe. Further he claimed that slope decline was a special case of slope development seen only in very weak rocks that could not maintain a scarp. Slopes that are convex upslope and concave downslope and have no free face were held by King to be a form that became common in the late Tertiary. King argued that this was the result of more slowly acting surface wash caused by carpets of grass which in turn would have resulted in relatively more soil creep. Unequal activity The notion that slopes in an area do not develop all at the same time is known as unequal activity. Colin Hayter Crick, who coined the term, proposed that unequal activity may be regulated by removal of debris at the base of slopes. Following this thought erosion by the sea and lateral stream migration are of prime importance as these processes are effective in removing debris.Huggett, p. 440 Unequal activity does also imply there are great disparities between stream erosion near stream channels and apparently unchanged uplands, and between headwaters with limited erosion and the more active middle and lower courses of streams. From this it is derived that landscapes and slopes with limited river erosion may in many cases be considered as stagnant in their evolution. Numerical models Contrary to early conceptual models that attempt to predict slope form a number of numerical models of erosion focus on describing what is happening at any given time, and are not concerned with changes in form. Average erosion rates for a slope has been estimated using numerical models. Using the heat transfer equation of Fourier as template W.E.H. Culling reasoned the flux of mass across the height gradient of a slope would could be described in a similar fashion as: ;Equation (1) On the left- hand side is sediment flux which is the volume of the mass that passes a line each time unit (L3/LT). K is a rate constant (L2/T), and ‚àáz the gradient or height difference between two points at a slope divided by their horizontal distance. This model imply sediment fluxes can be estimated from the slope angles (‚àáz). This has been shown to be true for low-angle slopes. For more steep slopes it is not possible to infer sediment fluxes. To address this reality the following model for high angle slopes can be applied: ;Equation (2) Sc stands here for the critical gradient which at which erosion and sediment fluxes runs away. This model show that when ‚àáz is far from Sc it behaves like equation 1. On the contrary when ‚àáz approaches Sc erosion rates becomes extremely high. This last feature may represent the behavior of landslides in steep terrain. At low erosion rates increased stream or river incision may make gentle slopes evolve into convex forms. Convex forms can thus indirectly reflect accelerated crustal uplift and its associated river incision.Chorley et al., p. 790 As shown by equation 2 the angle of steep slopes changes very little even at very high increases of erosion rates, meaning that it is not possible to infer erosion rates from topography in steep slopes other than hinting they are much higher than for lower angle slopes. Parabolic hills Beginning with the works of Grove Karl Gilbert (1909) and William Morris Davis (1892), soil-mantled convex or parabolic hills have long been held to reflect steady state equilibrium conditions of soil production and soil erosion. Contrary to what an equilibrium between the erosion rates functions described above and the soil production function should imply soil depth can vary considerably in parabolic hills as result of stochastic bedrock weathering into soil. This means that the expected soil formation rates from the soil production function might vary greatly across a landscape in geomorphic equilibrium. Convex hills are often associated to tors. Numerical modelling indicate that in periglacial settings broad low- angle convex hilltops can form in no less than millions of years. During the evolution of these slopes steeper initial slopes are calculated to result in the formation of numerous tors during the course of the lowering and broadening of the convex area. The presence of numerous tors would thus indicate that the original landscape was steeper and not flatter than present- day landscape.

Satyendranath Bose or Satyen Bose; 30 July 1882 ‚Äì 21 November 1908) was an Indian nationalist of the Anushilan Samiti. Bosu, while held in Alipore Jial hospital as an under-trial in the Alipore Bomb Case,shot dead with the help Kanailal Dutta the Crown witness Narendranath Goswami, leading to the collapse of the case against prime accused Aurobindo. Bosu gave himself up on the jail premises, and was subsequently put on trial, along with Dutta, found guilty and executed by hanging on 21 November 1908 for the murder of Goswami,  Early life  Satyendranath was born on 30 July 1882 in Midnapore district (presently Paschim Midnapore) of West Bengal, India. His father, Abhaya Charan Bosu, was a Professor in the Midnapur College. Since around 1850, he settled at Midnapur, which became the residence of Satyendranath's family. Abhaya Charan had five sons (Jnanendra Nath, Satyendra Nath, Bhupendra Nath, Subodh Kumar and another boy) and three daughters. Satyendranath was maternal uncle of Shri Aurobindo, though he was about ten year junior. The Bosu family originally hailed from the village Boral of district 24 Parganas, and descendants of famous Babu Raj Narayan Bosu. The father of Babu Raj Narayan Bosu, Babu Nanda Kishore Bosu, was a follower of Raja Ram Mohan Roy and was the first of his family to be initiated into Brahmoism. Babu Nanda Kishore had three sons, the eldest of whom was Babu Raj Narayan. The reputation of Babu Raj Narayan as a man of piety and letters was widespread. Besides, he was a distinguished member of the Adi Brahmo Samaj and was a Senior Scholar of the then Hindu College. His two younger brothers were Madan Mohan and Abhaya Charan. In the year 1850 or thereabout, Babu Raj Narayan, with his two younger brothers, left his ancestral village and settled at Midnapur where he was appointed Head Master of the district School. In 1867, he retired from Government service and came down to Calcutta where he lived for some time. In 1880 he finally settled with his family at Deoghur and died in the year 1899. Having successfully passed the Entrance and F.A. Examinations Satyendranath studied up to the B.A. standard of the Calcutta University but did not go up for the B.A. Examination. He left College and served for about a year at the Midnapur Collectorate. Revolutionary activities Satyendranath got involved in a stunning case of murder of Narendranath Goswami in the sequences of events in a series, in which there were three remarkable events of armed revolution at the dawn of nineteenth century. Midnapur arms case Satyendranath was arrested by the police in charge of possessing gun which was licensed in his brother's name at Midnapore. He was convicted and sentenced to two months‚Äô rigorous imprisonment, according to the police report. Kingsford assassination attempt Just two days after the Muzaffarpur bomb attack (30 April 1908) aimed at killing Kingsford, the police raided and arrested a number of revolutionaries in Bengal on 2 May 1908. 33 revolutionaries were charged with waging war against the government. Kanailal Dutta was one of these men, who was also arrested on 2 May 1908 and detained in Alipore Jail. Alipore Bomb Case Police raided premises at 32 Murari Pukur Road at Kolkata on 2 May 1908 and a bomb-factory was discovered as was a cache of arms, a large quantity of ammunition, bombs, detonators and other tools. They also confiscated Revolutionary literature. The raids were being conducted at various places throughout Bengal and Bihar, and more detention was on the move. Aurobindo Ghosh, Barindra Kumar Ghose, Ullaskar Dutt, Indu Bhusan Roy and many others were arrested. During this time one detainee, Narendranath Goswami (aka Norendra Nath Gossain), became approver of the British, and started revealing names of many persons to the police, leading to further arrests. Goswami was a resident of Srirampur near Chandernagore. He knew all the plans and activities of the revolutionaries. Appearing in the witness box he started implicating many of his former colleagues by mentioning their names. Barin Ghosh, Shanti Ghosh and Ullaskar Dutta's names were mentioned in attempting to blow off the governor's train at Chandernagore station in 1908; referring to the bomb outrage in the Mayor's house he mentioned name of Charu Chandra Roy, being the leader of the revolutionary outfit of Chandernagore; and on 24 June mentioned names of Aurobindo Ghosh and Subodh Chandra Mullick linking to revolutionary activities. A conspiracy hatched The under- trial prisoners under the leadership in Barin Ghosh hatched a plan to escape from the Alipur Central Jail, and also to get rid of Goswami. B.C. Roy, Barrister-at-law, defending the prisoners, offered help with men and arms. Barin wrote letters from jail to Sudhangshu Jiban Rai, Preo Shankar Rai and Basanta Banerjee of Chandernagore to meet B. C. Roy for arrangements of arms. He also wrote to Shrish Chandra Ghosh to send phial, acid for the purpose of throwing to jail wardens and wax to copy keys. On Sunday, 23 August, one revolver was smuggled into the jail by Shudhangshu Jiban Rai. Next day Barin asked Hem Das to give it to Satyendranath with instruction to kill Goswami. That time Satyendranath was admitted in the jail Hospital. He expressed his inability to use such a big revolver, and returned it back. On Sunday, 30 August, another revolver reached Barin though Shrish. it was a smaller one. Kanailal took it, and subsequently got admitted to the jail hospital. The Revolvers were received loaded. The stage was set. Murder of Narendranath Goswami It was time for retribution for the traitor inside Presidency Jail. It appears that the Narendranath, intentionally kept separated from the other prisoners, was confined in the European Ward in Alipore Central Jail. On 31 August 1908, Narerdranath was brought, from that ward, to the Jail Hospital by a European Convict Overseer named Highens. Narendranath had apparently previously arranged to meet, at that time, in the hospital, two fellow prisoners, who were already patients in the Jail Hospital, named Kanailal Dutta and Satyendranath Bosu. Kanailal and Satyendra managed to acquire two revolvers secretly. Shrish Chandra Ghosh of Chandernagore smuggled the revolvers into the jail, assisted by Motilal Roy. Narendranath had apparently been approached by the second of these prisoners, who had pretended that he also wished to make a statement; and his visit was really in order to get this statement. Evidently it was however part of a plot to get Narendranath within striking distance for it appears that almost immediately on Narendranath's arrival on the landing, at the head of the staircase leading to the second story of the hospital, these two prisoners opened fire on him with the two revolvers. Highens the Convict Overseer attempted to arrest one of them and was shot through the wrist. Narendranath although shot in several places was not mortally hit and fled down the stairs, out of the Hospital Compound and along an alley way towards the gate. Kanailal Dutta pursued him and shot him fatally through the back. He was then secured by a Eurasian Prisoner named Linton. (Excerpts from a letter No 1876-C dated 31 August 1908, addressed to The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Calcutta from Commissioner of Police, Calcutta. Nine shots fired Excerpts from the Magistrate's commitment order in the case of murder of Narendranath Goswami (spellings unchanged): Trial, sentencing and martyrdom Murder of Narendranath Goswami was a daring act unparalleled in the history of revolutionary terrorism. On 5 September 1908 the Indu Prakash made the following observation: On 21 October 1908, the High Court pronounced its judgment by giving sentence of death to both the accused. Kanailal declined to file an appeal against such order. The sentence was carried on 10 November 1908, and Kanailal was hanged till death in the Alipore Jail at about seven in the morning. In the trial of Satyendranath, the Sessions Judge, disagreeing with the majority verdict of the jury, referred the case to the High Court and there Satyendranath was convicted and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 21 November 1908. While fleeing from Muzaffarpur, on 2 May 1908, Prafulla Chaki was cornered at Mokama Ghat railway station and was about to get arrested when he took his own life by firing two shots one at the forehead and the other on the left side of his chest at the head. Khudiram Bose was the first martyr in the history of revolutionary movement for Indian independence. Kanailal Dutta was the second, and Satyendranath Bosu was the third. The execution of these men in 1908 aroused great commotion in public life. The witness accounts of the final moments before martyrdom and accounts of their sacrifices became canonical.

The tablet in the State Museum Lucknow (room J.1). It is an important example of Mathura art. Description This votive tablet, which is essentially an ayagapata, though not so called, represents a royal lady attended by three women and a child. The attendant women, in accordance with the ancient Indian fashion, are naked to the waist. One holds an umbrella over her mistress, whom another fans. The third holds a wreath ready for presentation. The execution is bold, and quite artistic. Inscription The tablet bears a three line epigraph mentioning that in the year 42 of \\"the Lord, the Great Satrap Sodasa\\" (16px12px15px 13px15px15px12px13px15px 20px12px16px Svamisa Mahak·π£atrapasa ≈öodasa) a monument for worship was set up by a certain Amohini. The text is as follows : Question of the date The inscription shows that the tablet was presented to the Jain shrine by a lady named Amohini in the year 42 or 72, in the reign of the Great Satrap Sodasa. The first numerals for the date may be read as 40, or possibly 70 (according to Buhler), so that the regnal date could be either 42 or 72 (with 72 being favoured by most). The date in Brahmi numerals appears clearly (ëÅûëÅì, 40+2), but interpretations diverge between 42 and 72. The tablet was found in Kankali Tila, right outside Mathura. According to Smith, the initial year of the era used by the great Satrap Sodasa is not known, but the inscription may be considered as dating a few years earlier than the Christian era or the 1st century. According to others, it is not known if the date 42/72 is a regnal year of Sodasa, or an era founded by his father or another ruler.From Persepolis to the Punjab, Elizabeth Errington, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis - 2007 According to some authors, the regnal date for Sodasa was 80 CE, so that the tablet would have been dedicated in 152 CE (50+72).Chhotelal Jain's Jaina Bibliography - Volume 1 - Chhotelal Jain, Satya Ranjan Banerjee - 1982, Page 809 A recent date for Sodasa's reign was given as 15 CE, meaning that the regnal date of the inscription would start from the Vikrama era started by Indo-Scythian king Azes I (Bikrami calendar (starting in 57 BCE)+72=15 CE).Image Problems: The Origin and Development of the Buddha's Image in Early South Asia Robert Daniel DeCaroli, University of Washington Press, 2015 p.205 This would put the long reign of his father Rajuvula in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE, which is probable.Indian Studies, Volume 7, Ramakrishna Maitra, 1966 p.67 Another inscription of the Satrap Sodasa was found by Alexander Cunningham in the Jail mound at Mathura. His coins also are found in the neighborhood. Design Splayed pillar with recumbent lions and central palmette on the Amohini ayagapata Mathura (mirrored half portion), 15 CE The Amohini tablet being quite securely dated to circa 15 CE under the reign of Sodasa, the design elements function as artistic markers for many other works of art in northern Indian. Particularly, the splayed pillar with recumbent lions and central palmette is considered as derived from Hellenistic Indo-Greek designs, and similar pillars are depicted in Bharhut, Sanchi or Bodhgaya, suggesting similar dates.

The King's role in the independence of the Belgian Congo  In the early 1950s, political emancipation of the Congolese elites, let alone of the masses, seemed like a distant event. But, it was clear that the Congo could not forever remain immune from the rapid changes that, after the Second World War, profoundly affected colonialism around the world. The independence of the British, French and Dutch colonies in Asia shortly after 1945 had little immediate effect in the Congo, but in the United Nations pressure on Belgium (as on other colonial powers) increased. Belgium had ratified article 73 of the United Nations Charter, which advocated self-determination, and both superpowers put pressure on Belgium to reform its Congo policy. However, the Belgian government tried to resist what it described as 'interference' with its colonial policy. It became increasingly evident that the Belgian government lacked a strategic long-term vision in relation to the independence of the Belgian Congo. ‚ÄòColonial affairs‚Äô did not generate much interest or political debate in Belgium, so long as the colony seemed to be thriving and calm. A notable exception was the young King Baudouin, who had succeeded his father, King Leopold III, under dramatic circumstances in 1951, when Leopold III was forced to abdicate.Van den Wijngaert, Mark; Dujardin, Vincent (2006). \\"La Belgique sans Roi, 1940‚Äì1950\\". Nouvelle histoire de Belgique. Brussels: √âd. Complexe, p.140. . Baudouin took a close interest in the Belgian Congo. On his first state visit to the Belgian Congo in 1955, King Baudouin was welcomed enthusiastically by cheering crowds of whites and blacks alike, as captured in Andr√© Cauvin‚Äôs documentary film, '. Foreign observers, such as the international correspondent of The Manchester Guardian or a Time journalist, remarked that Belgian paternalism ‚Äúseemed to work‚Äù, and contrasted Belgium‚Äôs seemingly loyal and enthusiastic colonial subjects with the restless French and British colonies. On the occasion of his visit, King Baudouin openly endorsed the Governor-General‚Äôs vision of a ‚ÄúBelgo-Congolese community‚Äù; but, in practice, this idea progressed slowly. At the same time, divisive ideological and linguistic issues in Belgium, which heretofore had been successfully kept out of the colony‚Äôs affairs, began to affect the Congo as well. These included the rise of unionism among workers, the call for public (state) schools to break the missions‚Äô monopoly on education, and the call for equal treatment in the colony of both national languages: French and Dutch. Until then, French had been promoted as the unique colonial language. The Governor-General feared that such divisive issues would undermine the authority of the colonial government in the eyes of the Congolese, while also diverting attention from the more pressing need for true emancipation. One year before independence While the Belgian government was debating a programme to gradually extend the political emancipation of the Congolese population, it was overtaken by events. On 4 January 1959, a prohibited political demonstration organised in L√©opoldville by ABAKO got out of hand. At once, the colonial capital was in the grip of extensive rioting. It took the authorities several days to restore order and, by the most conservative count, several hundred died. The eruption of violence sent a shock-wave through the Congo and Belgium alike. On 13 January, King Baudouin addressed the nation by radio and declared that Belgium would work towards the full independence of the Congo \\"without delay, but also without irresponsible rashness\\".Koning Boudewijn. 35 jaar dialoog met de natie. Een keuze uit de koninklijke toespraken van 1951 tot 1986. Lannoo Tielt, Inbel, 1986, p. 124. Without committing to a specific date for independence, the government of prime minister Gaston Eyskens had a multi-year transition period in mind. They thought provincial elections would take place in December 1959, national elections in 1960 or 1961, after which administrative and political responsibilities would be gradually transferred to the Congolese, in a process presumably to be completed towards the mid-1960s. On the ground, circumstances were changing much more rapidly.Young, Crawford (1965), Politics in the Congo\\" Decolonization and Independence, Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 140‚Äì161. Increasingly, the colonial administration saw varied forms of resistance, such as refusal to pay taxes. In some regions anarchy threatened.Ryckmans, Genevi√®ve (1995), Andr√© Ryckmans, un territorial du Congo belge. Paris. L'Harmattan, pp. 215‚Äì224. At the same time many Belgians resident in the Congo opposed independence, feeling betrayed by Brussels. Faced with a radicalisation of Congolese demands, the government saw the chances of a gradual and carefully planned transition dwindling rapidly. King Baudouin's speech King Baudouin addressed the nation, during a radio speech on the 13th of January 1959, on the road to independence of the Belgian-Congo. Full Speech (translated to English) The ultimate goal of our actions is, in prosperity and peace, to assist the Congolese people on their path to independence, without delay, but also without irresponsible rashness. In a civilized world, the independence of a nation symbolizes, combines and guarantees the values of freedom, order and prosperity. This goal however, can not be achieved without the following premises: strong and fair governmental institutions; a sufficient number of experienced government officials and clerks; a solid social, economic and financial organization, in the hands of experts in these fields; a broad intellectual and moral education of the people, without which, a democratic system will only be an excuse for ridicule, deception and oppression of the many by the few. We aim to create these conditions, which are at the basis of true independence, with the utmost care, in a friendly and passionate cooperation, together with our African citizens. It is not our intention to force European solutions onto the African peoples. On the contrary, we wish to promote the development of pragmatic policies and solutions, based on the African culture, that answer to the needs of the people.Koning Boudewijn. 35 jaar dialoog met de natie. Een keuze uit de koninklijke toespraken van 1951 tot 1986. Lannoo Tielt, Inbel, 1986, p. 124. Events following the King's speech In 1959, King Baudouin made another visit to the Belgian Congo, finding a great contrast with his visit of four years before. Upon his arrival in L√©opoldville, he was pelted with rocks by black Belgo-Congolese citizens who were angry with the imprisonment of Patrice Lumumba, convicted of incitement against the colonial government. Though Baudouin's reception in other cities was considerably better, the shouts of \\"Vive le roi!\\" were often followed by \\"Ind√©pendance imm√©diate!\\" The Belgian government wanted to avoid being drawn into a futile and potentially very bloody colonial war, as had happened to France in Indochina and Algeria, or to the Netherlands in Indonesia. For that reason, it was inclined to give in to the demands for immediate independence voiced by the Congolese leaders. Despite lack of preparation and an insufficient number of educated elite (mainly in the fields of economics, law and military science), the Belgian leaders hoped that things might work out. This became known as \\"Le Pari Congolais\\"‚Äîthe Congolese bet. In January 1960, Congolese political leaders were invited to Brussels to participate in the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference to discuss independence.R√©seau documentaire international sur la R√©gion des Grands Lacs, \\"Des ¬´Dialogues¬ª belgo-congolais aux Dialogues intercongolais 1960-2001: √Ä la recherche de l'unit√© et de la l√©gitimit√© en R.D.C.\\" Patrice Lumumba was discharged from prison and joined the negotiations in Brussels.

The exodus has become a humanitarian crisis. The persecution was preceded by crackdowns in 1978, 1991‚Äì1992, 2012 and 2015. The United Nations believes that Myanmar wants to expel its entire Rohingya population. The events have been termed a genocide by international observers. On 25 August 2017, the Tatmadaw (the Myanmar armed forces) launched a military operation against the Rohingya civilian population in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on 30 police posts and an army base. The Myanmar military‚Äîwith help from mobs of local Rakhine people‚Äîis alleged to have burned Rohingya villages, carried out summary executions and beheadings of Rohingyas (including children), raped Rohingya women; and planted landmines. Between 400 and 3,000 people were killed between 25 August and 11 September 2017. On 22 September 2017, satellite images indicated that Rohingya villages were still being burned. An estimated 655,500 refugees had fled into Bangladesh since 25 August 2017 (a larger weekly outflow of refugees than during the Rwandan genocide), out of a pre-violence Rohingya population of about one million in Rakhine State. In August 2018, study estimated that more than 24,000+ Rohingya people were killed by the Myanmar military and the local Buddhists since the \\"clearance operations\\" started on 25 August 2017. The study also estimated that 18,000+ the Rohingya Muslim women and girls were raped, 116,000 Rohingya were beaten, 36,000 Rohingya were thrown into fire https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333118905_Prevalence_of_violence_against_children_Evidence_from_2017_Rohingya_Refugee_crises Mass graves have been discovered in several parts of Rakhine State.http://time.com/5128225/myanmar-rohingya-mass-graves-crisis/ Evidence of atrocities emerged with reports of the Gu Dar Pyin massacre and Tula Toli massacre. Footage obtained by Reuters showed the summary execution of 10 Rohingya men. Two Myanma journalists who obtained the information for Reuters have since been arrested. Amnesty International has described Rakhine State as a \\"crime scene\\". There have been calls for the prosecution of members of Myanmar's military. Despite centuries of settlement in the Arakan region (now Rakhine State), the Rohingya population are denied citizenship and other basic rights under several controversial Myanmar laws (particularly the 1982 Myanmar nationality law). Myanmar has been accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya. International reaction has focused on pressuring Aung San Suu Kyi to condemn the atrocities and address human-rights issues. Suu Kyi's power is restricted under the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar, which places key ministries like home, border affairs and defense under military control and reserves 25 percent of seats in the Myanmar parliament for serving military officers. Military chief Min Aung Hlaing is regarded as the most powerful person in the country. The persecutions of ethnic Rohingyas in Myanmar continued up to 2018, and is viewed to continue until a lasting resolution is made between the Government of Myanmar (which has internal political disputes on the matter), the Government of Bangladesh, representatives from the Rohingya people, and states in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). Countries Afghanistan The Afghan foreign ministry said in a written statement, \\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan condemns in the strongest terms the devastating cruelty and murder of innocent Rohingya Muslims by Myanmar‚Äôs security forces. While vehemently condemning these vicious and inhuman attacks by the government forces against its Muslim population, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls on the United Nations and other International Human Rights Organizations to examine the genocide and massacre of innocent Muslim community in this country\\". Algeria The Algerian foreign ministry expressed \\"great concern\\" about the persecution. According to a spokesman, \\"The tragedies that occur behind closed doors in Burma where Burmese Muslim citizens are the victims, reached unspeakable heights in horror, according to information reported by many media and diplomatic sources\\". Australia In the spring of 2017 the Australian Senate passed a motion urging the government to call on the United Nations for a commission of inquiry. In early September 2017, as the Rohingya crisis became ethnic cleansing, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that Australia was deeply concerned by the escalating violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State and would provide up to to help Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Australia had long interned some of its own Rohingya refugees in camps on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea (whose government ruled the camps unlawful in 2016). PNG and Australia committed to closing the Manus Island camps by 31 October 2017. By mid-September 2017, Australia committed A$70 million more towards the Rohingya refugee crisis.\\"Rohingya asylum seeker claims he was pressured to accept cash from Australia to leave Manus,\\" 20 September 2017, SBS News, retrieved 26 September 2017 \\"Australia offers to pay Rohingya Muslims to return to Myanmar,\\" 21 September 2017, News.com.au (News Corp Australia) retrieved 25 September 2017\\"Australia offers $25,000 to Rohingya refugees willing to return to Myanmar,\\" 19 September 2017, South China Morning Post, retrieved 26 September 2017 Melbourne based Australian documentary photographer Salahuddin Ahmad organized a documentary photography exhibition series ‚ÄúBrutality Against Humanity‚Äù in many Australian cities (as well as many international locations) including street photo exhibition in Federation Square, Melbourne.

The word comes from the Telugu language. Podu is a form of shifting cultivation using slash-and-burn methods. Traditionally used on the hill-slopes of Andhra Pradesh, it is similar to the jhum method found in north-east India and the bewar system of Madhya Pradesh. Since the 1930s, there have been attempts to restrict its use in order to conserve forests and permit growth of commercial tree species such as teak. In the 1980s, it remained the principal method of tilling land for some tribal communities in districts such as East Godavari, West Godavari and, most prevalently, Srikakulam, although even by the 1950s its use by the Kolam and Naikpod tribes of Adilabad district had been entirely suppressed. One reason for the difference in treatment, whereby the system is tolerated in areas such as Srikakulam but its practitioners have been forcibly evicted in Adilabad, is that the people in some districts are relatively docile and have not risen up, with the encouragement of Naxalite insurgents, against outside interference as they have elsewhere. Ethnologist Christoph von F√ºrer-Haimendorf has noted that, at least in some areas, the podu system also carried implied land rights. A resident of a village could return to land that they had previously cultivated as part of a rotation without fear of dispute from other villagers, although land that had lain unused for some time was considered to be common property and could be adopted for clearance by any villager. He noted that over the period 1941-1979, which were the occasions of his academic field- work, forest officials had introduced restrictions on use but that these were not as onerous in some places as in others, and that in villages with little flat land there were none at all.

Early years Marina was born on 19 August 1896 in a shepherd family from SƒÉli»ôte (then part of Austria-Hungary). As a child she stood out in school, but also through her unusual courage: she rode the horses of the family when she was not even 10 years old. The death of her father, who died of gout before she was 12 years old, and the compulsory introduction of the Hungarian language in the Romanian schools in Hungary, implemented in 1907 through the new education laws (also called the \\"Apponyi laws\\"), led Marina to leave her home village and cross the Carpathian mountains to VƒÉratec Monastery in Romania at the age of 14. There she was ordained as a nun at the age of 18 and took the monastic name Mina, under the patronage of her aunt Mother Melania Cru»õiu. She shared the pain of leaving her home in a letter to her biographer, priest Grigorie Popescu: \\"I joined the convent due to the Hungarian persecution, which took us the freedom to speak our mother tongue in school, where we were taught only in Hungarian\\". World War I After the outbreak of the World War I (1914), during the two years of Romanian neutrality, special nursing courses were organized by the Red Cross in several centers in the country, including the VƒÉratec Monaster. The young nun volunteered: \\"You can imagine what joy we felt when we were able to serve and help our brothers who engaged in the struggle to free us from the Hungarian foreign yoke.\\" In May 1916 the War Ministry prepared the general mobilization and Mother Mina was assigned to the Tecuci Regional Hospital. After Romania's entry into the war (August 1916) and after the territorial losses that took place during the first months of war, including the occupation of Bucharest, the front stabilized in southern Moldavia. Campaign and regional hospitals behind the front were full of wounded. After her work had been noticed by her superiors, Mother Mina was authorized to wear a military uniform and she was mobilized close to the front line at MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, where she received the rank of second lieutenant. Mother Mina initially worked as a nurse in the hospital, but, when the fighting resumed, she moved closer to the front line trenches, where she took care of evacuating the wounded and transporting them to sanitary trains. In the summer of 1917, during the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti, while boarded on a military train that transported the wounded from MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti to Vaslui and Ia»ôi, she was seriously injured on her left thigh. Her foot was rescued from amputation at the hospital in Ia»ôi by doctor Gheorghiu. Impressed by her medical knowledge, the doctors suggested she stayed at Hospital no. 271 in Ia»ôi, led by Professor Gerota. After the outbreak of typhus epidemic in Ia»ôi, Doctor Gerota asked her to stay, saying, \\"There is no one to cry after you\\". On 7 July 1918, by High Royal Decree, Mother Mina was decorated with the \\"Commemorative Cross\\". Later years She returned after the war to VƒÉratec Monastery, with a clear conscience: \\"We, the nuns and the monks, threw ourselves into the uncertainty of life ... for the country and we served faithfully and went to war with all our hearts, to help the wounded for whom we worked with a holy feeling, to help them in suffering... We fulfilled our duty not as men or women, but as soldiers of the Lord and our country, by obeying to the end, till the end of the war.\\" After her aunt's death in 1923, Mother Mina moved to NƒÉmƒÉe»ôti Monastery, Arge»ô County. In the 1930s, with the blessing of Patriarch Miron Cristea, she enrolled at the \\"Regina Elisabeta\\" Charity Nursing Institute in Bucharest. At the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, Mother Mina was 45 years old. She was mobilized again and sent to the C√¢mpulung Muscel Hospital. She became an active member of the \\"Romanian War Charity Sisters Association\\". Her bravery, as well as her charity, were not forgotten many years after the end of the Second World War. In 1968, Mother Mina was awarded the Military Virtue Medal - 1st Class - in front of the Mausoleum of MƒÉrƒÉ≈üe≈üti on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of the World War I, along other war veterans. She died on 9 July 1977 at the NƒÉmƒÉe»ôti Monastery.

The novel was composed between 1901 and 1904, and while initially rejected by editors Treves, Baldini & Castoldi, it was published in November of 1906 by Societ√† Tipografica Editrice Nazionale (STEN). While the novel is autobiographical, no characters are named.  Plot  The novel is told in three parts and begins with the protagonist as a young girl, describing her childhood. The relationship between the protagonist and her father was very influential to her development, and he encouraged his daughter to read, study, and foster a sense of surety and independence. Her mother is less present and the young protagonist views her as weak and submissive in comparison to her father. When the protagonist was eight years old her father decided to leave Milan and his position as an engineer, and move the family to the South. There, he took up management of a factory and eventually employed his daughter as a secretary when she was around twelve. She enjoys the new environment and her work in the factory. The protagonist also describes the conditions of the town, where the majority of the families are lower income and critique the protagonist for her unconventional behavior. Tensions continue to rise between the father and mother, and she grows increasingly unwilling to leave the house while his critiques of her become more frequent. This culminates in the mother attempting suicide, which she survives. However, it triggers an escalation in her dementia and she is eventually committed to an insane asylum. She remains there until her death. The protagonist discovers that her father had been having an affair for some time, and their relationship grows strained and distant. During this delicate time, she starts to spend more time with a factory worker who she had considered a friend. He takes advantage of her vulnerable position and sexually assaults her, and she is forced to marry him within the course of several months. She is transferred to his family home, gives birth to a son, but continues to suffer his cruel behavior. After her husband discovers that the protagonist had been responding to the attentions of another man, he brutally beats her and keeps her shut away in their home. During this period, with only her son to comfort her, she comes to love and depend on him as her only source of happiness. However, she also is beset by a growing depression, and attempts suicide after another violent beating. She is saved by the village's doctor, a kind man who had been checking on her periodically during her seclusion. Because of a conflict with his father-in-law, the protagonist's husband decides to quit his job at the factory and move to Rome. There, the protagonist is afforded more freedom, helping to support the family by working as a writer at a feminist magazine. She makes several friends who help to foster a sense of independence and broaden her worldview, and she develops the theory that a woman must develop an identity outside of being a wife and mother. While in Rome the protagonist's husband becomes jealous over the friendship she has with a male friend, and begins to beat her again. With a job and support system her only fear is that she won't be able to bring her child with her if she were to decide to leave her husband, which is confirmed when he refuses to consider an amicable separation. Meanwhile, the protagonist's father has decided to leave his position as the director of the factory and move back to the North. He leaves the post to his son-in-law, and the protagonist is left in Rome by herself while her husband goes back to work. After a friend that she was caring for passes, she returns to the South. While living in the home that her mother had deteriorated in she feels more connected to her, and understands her struggle from so many years ago. Her husband continues to treat her poorly, and she finds out that he has contracted an STD. She realizes that if she stays with her family she will eventually either go mad like her mother, or commit suicide. The book ends with the protagonist leaving her husband and son, and moving in with her sister in the North. She tries to keep in contact with her son, but his letters are eventually intercepted by the husband. The book is dedicated to her son, in the hope that he will read it and understand her decision. Adaptations In 1977 the novel was adapted by Rai into a televised miniseries, directed by Gianni Bongiovanni. The protagonist was played by Giuliana De Sio.

Published in 2009, the stories are described as being strange, gently absurb, wry, and dark whimsy. Humor While the stories contain dark humor the underlying themes play off of social awkwardness and individuality, and remind the reader to not take life to seriously. Richards introduces Simon Snootle who falls into his parents well with the neighborhood cats: He is not aware of any tragedy of the situation, but rather makes the best of it, knowing that eventually more things will fall in as he did. He also writes of a boy named Boil who hides in a school bus cushion to be more like his pet earwig, Peter Puddlestick who has a life changing moment when he happens upon a dead bird, a shrub that enjoys stealing hats and hairpieces, and Mr. Slowbug whose slow demeanor causes him to become a fashion accessory. Illustration Richards ink and graphite illustration style is considered reminiscent of Edward Gorey and Tim Burton.

The cover was foiled stamped with a cat logo designed by Richards. The second edition was also handmade by the author but the cover included a primarily yellow illustration of Simon Snootle in the well with the cats and a hose lowering down into it.

Gulchara was close to King Simon I of Kartli. A contemporary Persian historian reports her being a relative of Simon's family, while the Portuguese envoy in Persia, Ant√≥nio de Gouveia, claims she was Simon's concubine. Mainstream scholarship in Georgia identifies Gulchara, a name or sobriquet based on Persian Gol-chehra, \\"rose- faced\\", as being the same person as Simon's granddaughter and Giorgi X's daughter, Tinatin (or Elene), who is known to have visited Simon during his confinement in Constantinople. Present-day historian David Blow presents her as a wife of Simon. Simon I of Kartli, caught in the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid rivalry and anxious to preserve his kingdom's precarious autonomy, ended up as a prisoner of the Yedikule Fortress at Constantinople in 1600. Gulchara, who had once accompanied Simon to the Safavid capital of Isfahan, was brought to Constantinople to care for the aged king. She quickly befriended Sultan Mehmet III's mother and garnered respect and trust at the court, impressing the European diplomats in Constantinople with her \\"beauty, grandeur, and eloquence\\". Faced with disaster in the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War, Mehmet's mother decided to approach Shah Abbas I of Persia through the latters aunt Zeynab Begum (who wielded considerable influence in the Safavid royal court) by using Gulchara as envoy. Mehmet III's mother promised Gulchara, that if she would succeed in her mission, the Ottomans would release \\"her husband\\" from captivity. On Gulchara's first mission to meet Shah Abbas, she was allowed to include Simon. But Ahmet's ministers feared Simon might reveal too much to Abbas and Simon was recalled back to Yedikule after seven days' journey into the mission. After several diplomatic trips and the Ottoman military failures, in 1612 a peace party in Constantinople, which included Gulchara, persuaded the sultan to accept peace terms, which recapitulated those of the 1555 Treaty of Amasya. Her efforts were too late for the ailing king Simon, who died at Yedikule at the age of 74 in 1611. Gulchara's subsequent fate is unknown.

He is the older son of former PUK leader Jalal Talabani. Military career Bafel Talibani, CIA, Special ForcesBafel underwent formal military training with the French Foreign Legion and British Special Forces. Following the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Bafel returned to Kurdistan and took up his first official role as head of the Zanyari, the PUK's intelligence unit. In 2004, he created and commanded the Counter- Terrorism Group (CTG), recruited from within Kurdistan's Peshmerga armed forces, that was focused on delivering front-line military counter-insurgency capability in support of U.S.-led coalition objectives. These were initially focused on combatting the spread of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. That same year, his name was associated with a counterintelligence mission that resulted in the killing of Abdullah Qasre, a member of the Kurdistan Islamic Group's (Komal) political bureau. He stepped down from active military service in 2010 to support the political interests of the PUK. Nevertheless, he continued to be engaged with the fight against The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as ISIL or Daesh, through his leadership of the CTG and coordination with the Iraqi armed forces. This effort led to the historic liberation of Mosul and ultimately the defeat of ISIS. Political career After leaving active service, Bafel based himself at the family compound in Sulaymaniyah. He is credited as being a dealmaker and a political fixer within the party, as well as being able to move smoothly across partisan divides in the best interests of Kurdistan. Bafel was also behind his younger brother Qubad Talabani's emergence as a political figure with the latter becoming deputy prime minister of Iraqi Kurdistan. In 2016, Bafel headed PUK's decision-making body and accompanied PUK's delegation to Iran for talks. He is claimed to have had a decisive role in bringing back traditional PUK leaders as a strongman of the Talabani family. He is credited with de-escalating PUK tensions, restoring a joint leadership of PUK with Gorran [Change Movement] and preparing a unified response to Masoud Barzani, former President of Iraqi Kurdistan and strongman of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). Developments in late 2017 During the Kurdistan independence referendum of September 2017, Bafel mediated between the top-level leadership of the KRG, Iraq and the international community, and worked to present an alternative delayed-vote solution. Although accepted by the main actors both internally and externally, the solution was ultimately rejected by Masoud Barzani. Bafel blamed the loss of Kirkuk and oil-rich regions on the decision of the Kurdish leadership to go ahead with a referendum on independence. He called the decision a \\"colossal mistake\\", saying a U.S. proposal to postpone the referendum by two years should have been accepted. This would have avoided the current situation in which Iraqi federal forces regained control of areas managed by Kurds since 2014. In October, Iraqi forces took control of Kirkuk province after intense fighting against Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Bafel Talabani purportedly ordered his military forces to withdraw from the region, allowing the Iraqi Army and the Shia militia Popular Mobilization Forces (Hashd al-Shaabi) to reestablish control of the region. Subsequently, he has been criticized by nationalist Kurdish forces for the \\"betrayal\\" of the Kurdish struggle for independence. Bafel, however, strongly denied the accusations. He rejected as \\"baseless\\" claims that this was part of a deal he had brokered with Baghdad and Tehran, arguing that his forces had indeed fought and lost soldiers but decided to withdraw because of too many losses had occurred within the ranks of the Peshmerga.\\"Bafel Talabani Reveals New Information on Kirkuk Development\\", Millet Press, 21 October 2017. Moreover, it emerged in a New York Times interview published in November 2017 that before the hand-over of Kirkuk, Bafel proposed yet another out of the box solution. He envisioned troops from the American-led coalition against ISIS to take over a large military base near Kirkuk, along with federal forces and Kurdish forces loyal to his father's party. According to the New York Times article, Bafel was unable to build consensus among the PUK and the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party to proceed with his alternative plan. Following his father's death in October 2017 and recent events, Bafel is focused on supporting the re-emergence and reinvigoration of the PUK to be able to deliver an economically strong, socially inclusive, and stable Kurdistan. Personal life He is the son of Jalal Talabani, Secretary-General of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Hero Ibrahim Ahmed. He is the older brother of Qubad Talabani and a cousin of Lahur Talabany. He is married to the daughter of Mala Bakhiyar, considered a mastermind of the PUK.

However, it occurs throughout the world including the United Kingdom, Europe and Netherlands. Pithomyces chartarum produces a mycotoxin called sporidesmin when it grows on plants, particularly grasses. Presence of the toxin in forage grasses causes facial eczema in sheep, and is especially problematic in areas such as New Zealand where sheep are intensively raised. Other health effect of P. chartarum are not well understood. History and taxonomy This species was first discovered by Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis as Sporidesmium chartarum in 1874. It was independently named Sporidesmium bakeri by German mycologists Hans and Paul Sydow in 1914. Canadian mycologist Stanley Hughes examined specimens of both taxa in 1958 and concluded that they represented the same taxon which he contemplated assigning them to the genus Scheleobrachea. Several years later, the British mycologist Martin Ellis described the fungus in the genus Pithomyces as P. chartarum. It has been suggested that P. chartarum may be indigenous to New Zealand. Growth and morphology Pithomyces chartarum produces spores that are multicellular and darkly pigmented, although they are produced sparsely. The spores can be barrel- shaped, ellipsoidal or club-shaped. Pithomyces chartarum has three vegetative hyphal types: sparsely septate, densely septate, and densely septate with surface spines. The colonies are fast growing and their morphology depends on temperature. When the temperature is below , the sparsely septate morphology predominates in contrast to the densely septate for that is stimulated by temperatures of . The spores that are germinating produce hyaline superficial hyphae which can easily penetrate plant cell walls. The conidiophores bear simple conidia, they are short, thin walled and usually nonseptate. The conidia are considered aleurioconidia because they arise singly at the apex of each conidiophore. Conidia may also form in clusters on a network of conidiogenous branches. Mature conidia typically have three transverse septa and up to two longitudinal septa. Physiology The production of conidia and vegetative hyphae are good at . Conidia require free water to germinate and do not germinate at water potentials below -140 bars. The production of conidia is stimulated in vitro by exposure to near UV-light. Warm ground temperatures and high humidity cause rapid growth but lower temperatures result in higher sporidesmin content of conidia. Pithomyces chartarum produces sporidesmin but also has been seen to produce cyclodepsipeptides and sporidemolides. Habitat and ecology Pithomyces chartarum is more likely to be found in tropical locations but its range might be expanding. It can be found in pastures growing on debris and on damaged potato leaves, on dead leaves and stem of plants and occasionally in indoor environments on paper, ceiling tiles and may be present in carpet and mattress dust. It is thought to be especially frequent on fodder grasses.Pithomyces chartarum foliar infections can be clearly observed because they result in the formation of necrotic spots; however, recent studies have suggested that plant infections may be asymptomatic under certain circumstances. Growth of the fungus is inhibited in vitro by Bacillus subtilis and cochliodinol. Disease Pithomyces chartarum is known to cause facial eczema in sheep and cattle, prevalent in New Zealand and occasionally in Australia. It is more common in sheep and deer, and goats seem to be less affected. Due to the growth required for the spores, we normally see cases occur after warm rains in fall or in summer. Symptoms of animal illness are usually apparent 10‚Äì14 days after ingestion. Animal disease caused by this fungus can be controlled in farm animals by avoiding short grazing, feeding cattle zinc or by using benzimidazole fungicides on pastures. The effects on human health are not well understood but it is thought that P. chartarum could also be involved in glue blotch disease of rice.

Form The novel is in prose, with several quotations of free verse by one of the characters, Lilja, and passages where the prose style itself could be seen to drift into free verse. Chapters are short, and chapter titles prosaic and sometimes detailed, evoking eighteenth-century novels (for example, '√Å lei√∞inni √° annan fund terroristakl√∫bbsins' [on the way to the second meeting of the terrorist club'] and 'Fr√°s√∂gn Geira af fer√∞ sinni til Palest√≠nu' [Geiri's account of his journey to Palestine]). The novel is divided into two parts, the first part ('fyrri hluti') set in September 2008 and the second ('seinni hluti') set in November 2008. The narrative of the novel's present is presented linearly and in the present tense. However, chapters set in the novel's present are interspersed with chapters, whose titles state the year in which they are set, narrating flashbacks, mostly concerning the principal character, S√≥li. These passages in particular are characterised by an absence of punctuation, and at times depart from conventional typographical layouts, using layout to artistic effect in the style of concrete poetry. The language throughout the novel tends to be colloquial, and dominated by realistic direct speech. Summary The principal characters are S√≥li, Mark√∫s, Geiri, Lilja and D√≥ra, well educated twenty-to-thirty-something would-be radicals living in 101 Reykjav√≠k. At the opening of the story, they form a ‚Äòterroristakl√∫bb‚Äô ('terrorist club'), whose name points firmly to their integration into US-driven discourses of the ‚Äòwar on terror‚Äô, and naively unreflective attitude to what living up to their name might really entail. They are mostly depicted meeting and chatting in bars in the town, where they discuss left-wing revolutionaries and plot a terrorist attack. They struggle, however, to agree on a name for the group, much less on the deed itself, and the relationships between them are complicated by sexual attractions and liaisons. Their main achievement is to gain the opportunity to send two of their number to travel to Palestine as aid workers. Eventually Geiri and D√≥ra are chosen, but D√≥ra is killed by being run over by a tank (evoking the death in 2003 of Rachel Corrie). Her death comes just as the 2009 ‚Äòkitchenware revolution‚Äô is gathering pace, so that what should be the terroristakl√∫bb‚Äôs moment to shine is cast into shadow, putting the characters‚Äô inability to act meaningfully within their own society‚Äîlet alone elsewhere‚Äîin a particularly stark light.Cf.

Following the success of those projects, he turned into media. In 2010, he established Nalia Media Company, which now has four satellite channels in Kurdish NRT News(NRT, NRT2, NRT3, and NRT4). Another channel, NRT Arabic, was also a successful TV station until in October 2019, during the anti-government protests in Baghdad, its offices were ransacked by an armed group and forced off-air. In 2013, he launched Chavy Land amusement project in Sulaimani, which is a major tourism hotspot for locals and visitors. NRT TV NRT News has faced multiple threats including burning down its HQ in Sulaimani in 2011 following the anti-government demonstrations (only three days following its launch). Kurdistan referendum 2017 Abdulwahid entered politics in 2017, during the Kurdistan Region‚Äôs independence referendum. Shaswar launched a \\"No for now\\" campaign to explain the economic and political risks of a \\"Yes\\" vote in the 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum, despite being branded a traitor by his political enemies for voicing concerns held by international community. He called the referendum as \\"an excuse by Kurdish leaders to remain in power\\". New Generation Movement In 2018, Abdulwahid established the New Generation Movement List to take part in the Iraqi and local parliamentary elections. The List was able to secure four seats in Iraq‚Äôs Council of Representatives in May 2018 and eight seats in Kurdistan Parliament in the regional elections in September 2018. With these achievements, the New Generation became the fourth largest group amongst 40 political parties in the Kurdistan Parliament. Abdulwahid has been arrested three times since the referendum in 2017: at the end of 2017, he was accused of inciting demonstrations; in March 2019, he was accused of insulting government employees; and, in May 2019, he was accused of misusing mobile technologies. He and his supporters have argued that these arrests were politically motivated, noting that he has had prominent companies, businesses, and TV channels since 2007 but was not never arrested until 2017 when he became an influential political player on the side of the opposition. Abdulwahid‚Äôs New Generation now has an outspoken opposition group in the Kurdistan Parliament, which constantly monitors the works of the government and offer serious feedback and criticism on the political system in Iraq and the Kurdistan Region.

LeFevre left the industry in 2012 to write his memoir, published in 2015, which became a New York Times Bestseller, and was option by Paramount as a movie with Zac Efron attached to the project.  GSElevator  LeFevre created the @GSElevator Twitter in August 2011 as an \\"homage\\" to an earlier account called @CondeElevator, which shared supposedly overheard snippets from publisher Cond√© Nast. He would later describe his goal as \\"to illuminate Wall Street culture in an entertaining and insightful way\\". The account proved immediately successful and within a couple weeks, LeFevre (anonymously) was interviewed by Kevin Roose at The New York Times. By 2014, the account had over 600,000 followers. LeFevre later began writing articles and banking guides for Business Insider under the name \\"Goldman Sachs Elevator\\". He would later form \\"GSE Media\\" as a digital media entity to control the business interests of @GSElevator and expand by creating websites such as \\"The Whim\\" to house his content.  Straight to Hell  In 2014, LeFevre began shopping around a book proposal based on his life as a banker, to be released under a pseudonym and marketed as by the man behind @GSElevator. The proposed title, under which it was eventually published, was Straight to Hell: True Tales of Deviance, Debauchery and Billion Dollar Deals.

It is believed to be the only painting produced collaboratively by the group. History Images of a Woman was painted over three nights in July 1966 in a Tokyo Hilton suite where all four of the Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) were staying as part of their tour of the Far East. The group had been placed in lockdown as a precaution by the Japanese authorities after death threats had been received. The Japanese tour promoter, Tats Nagashima, had painting materials brought in for the group to use. The band's tour photographer, Robert Whitaker, was present and was amazed by how tranquil the band members seemed as they painted: \\"Absolutely the best period I ever witnessed among the Beatles\\", Whitaker said, adding that he \\"never saw them calmer, more contented than at this time... They'd stop, go and do a concert, and then it was 'Let's go back to the picture!'\\" The resulting painting was given to a charity auction. It was originally bought by the Japanese Beatles fan club president, Tetsusaburo Shimoyama. In the mid-1990s it was sold to an art dealer in Osaka for around $191,000, and re-appeared in 2002 on the website eBay. It was put up for sale by Philip Weiss Auctions in 2012, selling in New York City for $155,250. Description Each of the Beatles painted one corner of the 30 √ó 40 inch canvas. Despite the painting's title, it does not feature any figurative depictions of a woman, consisting only of abstract designs painted using oil and watercolour against a brightly coloured background. A lamp left in the middle of the canvas left a blank circle when it was removed; the group used this space for their signatures.

The union is the constituent body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for Staffordshire, and administers and organises rugby union clubs and competitions in the county. It also administers the Staffordshire county rugby representative teams.  History  Although there had been a number of long established clubs such as Burton (founded in 1870), Lichfield (1874) and Wolverhampton (1875), it took until 1923 for the Staffordshire Rugby Union to be formed, when it was part of the North Midlands Rugby Football Union. As the county started to find its identify in the 1920s more sides would start to form, with clubs such as Walsall (1921) and Stafford (1925) coming into existence during this period. Despite its formation in 1923, Staffordshire would not be recognised as a constituent body by the RFU until the 1960s. In 1961 a representative side defeated the reigning county champions Cheshire in a friendly match. This result showed the RFU that Staffordshire were ready to be included in the County Championships and the following year they would take part for the first time, being finally awarded constituent body status in 1962. On 14 March 1970, Staffordshire won the County Championship when they upset favourites Gloucestershire 11‚Äì9 in the final played at Peel Croft in Burton upon Trent. Since the glory days of 1970 Staffordshire have failed to win another county championship, and the reformation of the county game at the start of the 21st century saw them drop down to the third tier. In 2016 Staffordshire won both of their pool games in the Shield competition, reaching Twickenham for the very first time. Unfortunately they were unable to add to their silverware as they were beaten 11‚Äì30 by Hampshire in the final.

He was the commander of the Israel Defense Forces Leadership Development School, co-founder and director of the Institute for Quality Leadership in Israel, and, from 1995 he was a faculty member and head of the Organizational Psychology program at the University of Haifa. Biography Popper received his BA degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and his MA and PhD degrees from Tel Aviv University. Career Popper's early research focused on exploring the roots of leadership in early childhood. Most knowledge in this field is inferred from biographies and studies (based mostly on psycho-dynamic analyses) of well-known people. His work in this field led him to formulate a conceptual framework dealing with three components relevant to being and functioning as a leader: (1) the psychological potential to lead (P); (2) the motivation to be in a leadership position (M); (3) the environment (e.g. role models, accessibility to leadership experiences...), namely the developmental component (D). Popper and his colleagues have contributed to the identification, definition, evaluation and measurement of each of these components.e.g. Popper, M., Amit, K., Gal, R., Sinai, M. & Lissak, A. (2004). The capacity to lead: Major psychological differences between ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-leaders‚Äù. Military Psychology 16, 4, 245‚Äì263). Popper observed that in the Western world, particularly the US, leadership was usually perceived as a positive phenomenon and leaders were socially respected, often even admired. However, history also points to dark manifestations of leadership. This aspect has been discussed by historians but largely neglected in psychological research on leadership. Popper's work sheds light on the psychological foundations of the dark side of leadership.see e.g., Popper, M. (2001). Hypnotic Leadership. Westport, CT: Prager. He argued that psychological research on leadership was excessively preoccupied with leaders and there were not enough theoretical and empirical attempts to decipher the phenomenon of followership. Popper's work has thus focused on primary foundations of followership, both the phylogenetic elements and the cultural components that ‚Äúcolor‚Äù differently leaders‚Äô perceptions and images in various cultures.Examples of this approach are Popper, M. (2012). Fact and fantasy about leadership. London: Edward Elgar; Popper, M., Castelnovo, O. (2017).The function of great leaders in human culture: A cultural-evolutionary perspective. Leadership, on line, of August, 2017. Popper has also researched ‚Äúorganizational learning.‚Äù His work has focused mostly on how people learn from their own experiences and how lessons learned on a personal level become organizational knowledge. The first question involves the development of concepts and methodologies for identifying ‚Äútacit knowledge‚Äù ‚Äì knowledge created out of experience without awareness. Such knowledge is at the disposal of people when solving problems (as Polanyi puts it:‚Äù We know more than we can tell‚Äù). The second question led Popper and his colleagues to study the structural and cultural aspects that characterize effective learning in organizations. These studies focused on organizational learning mechanisms such as debriefing of air force pilots or debriefing of medical staff performing operations.The structural-cultural approach to organizational learning is presented in Lipshitz, R., Friedman, V. & Popper, M.

Children‚Äôs rights embrace legal, social and other issues concerning children.  Legal status of the child  According to the Law on the Rights of the Child and the Family Code of Azerbaijan, when a child‚Äôs rights and interests are violated, including failure of parents in their responsibilities in a child‚Äôs education and upbringing, the child has the right to apply to a number of judicial state bodies, as well as the courts. A child can apply individually or through their representatives depending on the right that has been violated and the corresponding procedural rules thereof. One department of the State Committee for Family, Woman and Child issues that was established at the presidential decree dated on 6 February 2006, deals with problems in this context. The Committee holds responsibility for protecting children, developing their welfare, providing their rights and freedoms as well as coordination of state policy in this sphere. It conducts regular monitoring in state-controlled institutions, investigates applications made by citizens, organizes acknowledging campaigns, training and events for experts and children, etc. The Azerbaijani Government and this Committee cooperate with international institutions in a related-field. Furthermore, Azerbaijan closely cooperates with UNICEF in the field of education, health and other social issues such as children with disabilities, street children, and preventing violence against children, early marriages, child mortality, and preschool education.  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)  In 1992, the UN Convention on the ‚ÄúRights of the Child‚Äù was ratified in Azerbaijan and eight years later, its two Optional Protocols were ratified, including ‚ÄúInvolvement of children in armed conflicts‚Äù and ‚ÄúSale of children, child prostitution and child pornography‚Äù. Azerbaijan adopted the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice in 1993, the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages in 1996, the European Social Charter in 2004, and the Convention on Elimination of Discrimination in Education Sphere in 2006. The Government provides the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNHCR) with periodic reports for the implementation of Convention and its two Optional Protocols. In addition, Azerbaijan is a side to the Universal Declaration on ‚ÄúSurvival, protection and development of children‚Äù. A number of national legislative acts have been confirmed in the ‚Äúon protection of child rights‚Äô as well.  Legal status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)  The CRC is incorporated into national law. In addition, Azerbaijan released the Law on the Rights of the Child harmonizing its legislation with the principles stated in the CRC in 1998. However, the Committee on the Rights of the Child empathized a number of areas of national law which are needed to be reformed in order to be in keeping with the Convention.  UNICEF  UNICEF has been operating in Azerbaijan since 1993. The main aims of the program include establishing a protective environment for all children without making any discrimination. The protection of children against violence, exploitation, abuse and discrimination is a global priority for UNICEF. In Azerbaijan, the principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women manage the program. UNICEF accepts survival, protection and development of children as a basis for human progress. In addition, children and families from developing countries get services from UNICEF which it uses political will and material resources to assist the developing countries to guarantee a ‚Äúfirst call for children‚Äù and to form their capacity to develop relevant policies. Furthermore, the organization focuses on providing special protection for the most disadvantaged children- victims of war, disasters, extreme poverty, all forms of violence and exploitation and those with disabilities. Moreover, it cooperates with United Nations partners and humanitarian agencies to rapidly respond to the issues of children‚Äôs rights. In this regard, UNICEF started a project based on children in conflict with the law in 2005. The aims of project include raising awareness of policemen, judges and care/security personnel on human rights of children with the law and establishing proper referral system to help children in the contact with the law enforcement and justice environments. In terms of the project, the organization took actions below: Action on Integration of Children with Disabilities: UNICEF aims to change attitudes towards children with disabilities in Azerbaijan through reforming home education and reviewing data collection. Action on Street Children: UNICEF targets improvement of community-based social services for children and working in the streets by working with child protection authorities and NGOs. Action on Mine Risk Education: In order to enlighten children about possible mine /UXO explosions, UNICEF is working with local partners to add Mine Risk Education in the school curriculum in frontline districts.  United Aid for Azerbaijan ‚Äì UAFA  In 1998, United Aid for Azerbaijan (UAFA) was founded aiming to ‚Äòaid long-term development of life in Azerbaijan, with particular focus on children, health and education‚Äô. UAFA operates as a local NGO in Azerbaijan though registered in the UK. Pilot projects were introduced by UAFA in cooperation with state bodies to support children with disabilities and their families, bring pre-school services to children from low-income families and establish small teams of social workers in regions where disability, poverty and location threaten the stability of a family.  International Day of Children‚Äôs Protection  Azerbaijan celebrates the International Day of Children‚Äôs Protection on June 1. Azerbaijan prioritizes a protection of children. In this regard, the actions regarding the development of living conditions, health, education and future employment of children were covered in the State Program of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Child Policy. Furthermore, a special focus was given to the organization of a range of events on children from vulnerable groups, such as children deprived of parental care, with disabilities, from national minorities, as well as refugee and IDP children. In addition, Heydar Aliyev Foundation, founded in May 2004, implements a number of projects on the development of childcare institutions‚Äô infrastructure, providing funding for the renovation of orphanages and boarding schools and construction of nursery schools and kindergartens.

Besides the main running line, it had two branches that headed south into Yorkshire that were only used for freight. The whole system opened up by July 1856 and was closed completely by 1966. The former Merrybent freight branch is now used as part of the A1(M) road that bypasses to the west of Darlington. History The line was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1854 and opened up to traffic in July 1856. The act had been through Parliament in the 18th century with the route been designated as a canal with branches south into Yorkshire. The railway proposal had been through the process of approval once before and was rejected due to local landowner opposition. A further act of 1858, subsumed the company into the Stockton & Darlington Railway. The line became the eastern link between Darlington and as part of the South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway (SD&LUR;), more commonly known as The Stainmore Line. The line followed the valley of the River Tees west of Darlington and was engineered with easy gradients, although the 1-in-81 west facing uphill bank between and was the steepest gradient on the section between the two towns. During the construction period, heavy rains in October 1855 swept away two bridges being built over the River Tees by the contractors. The line was engineered by Thomas Bouch for ¬£120,000. The line was double track from the junction west of station as far as the Forcett branch (west of ). Thereafter it was single as far as Broomielaw, where it formed double track again as far as Barnard Castle. Piercebridge and Winston stations had two platforms, whereas and Broomielaw only had one platform each. The original station at Barnard Castle was closer to the town, but because of the distance between the original station and the one further north on the SD&LUR; line, all passenger trains were concentrated on the second site which was a through site rather than the original terminus. The original station was then used as a goods facility, though, as it was no longer servicing passengers, the portico from the station entrance was moved to Saltburn Valley Gardens in 1867 as part of a memorial to Prince Albert. The line was single through Broomielaw with a junction to provide double track at the western end of the station area. The station at Broomielaw was a private halt for the owners of the nearby Streatlam Castle. The station was declared public in 1936 but did not appear in the LNER Timetable until June 1942. The three original intermediate stations of Piercebridge, Winston and Gainford all had a single- storey station cottage designed by William Bryson who worked under Thomas Bouch. Between 1867 and 1874, all of these cottages were extended to have an upper floor. At the eastern end of the line, the track diverted at Stooperdale Junction which was originally opened in 1859 to allow trains from to access the line to Barnard Castle. When the SD&LUR; line opened in 1863, this practice ceased as the SD&LUR; provided a more direct route. Latterly, the line was used to afford trains access to either the original Stockton & Darlington line north to or east to North Road and Bank Top stations in Darlington. The triangle at Stooperdale was used to turn locomotives that were arriving or departing from the adjacent locomotive works. A one-road engine shed was provided at Barnard Castle in 1865. This was extended in 1875 into two roads and by the time of the grouping in 1923, had an allocation of seven engines. The shed closed in 1937. Traffic on the line increased during the Second World War with numerous training camps being built in the Barnard Castle area. Troops and tanks were offloaded at Barnard Castle and Broomielaw stations. The station crane in Barnard Castle goods station was destroyed after a tank was accidentally driven off one of the wagons in the yard and crushed the crane. After the Stainmore Line had closed, the D&BCR; was kept open for trains to the branch beyond Barnard Castle into which covered a distance of . The whole line through Barnard Castle to Middleton-in-Teesdale closed to passengers in November 1964. The line between Forcett Junction and Barnard Castle was closed in April 1965, with the rest of the branch closing in May 1966. Stations Barton Quarry in North Yorkshire, located at the end of the former Merrybent branch  Forcett and Merrybent branches Stockton & Darlington Railway third class carriage No 179, used by the Forcett Limestone Company The Forcett branch was authorised in 1865 to serve the limestone quarries in the area and was from the junction west of Piercebridge on the D&BCR.; The branch did not open until February 1867, and even then was delayed in forwarding traffic as the track had not been ballasted properly or been engineered correctly. The line was worked by the NER but retained its independence until the grouping of 1923, when it became an LNER asset. The Merrybent Railway was built to convey copper, lead and limestone for the Merrybent and Middleton Tyas Mining and Smelting Company. The branch line was authorised by an act of Parliament in 1866, opened in 1870 but it closed in 1878 due to financial difficulties. The NER purchased the line in 1890 and re-opened it soon afterwards. It continued to forward aggregate from the quarries around Barton until 1950 when it was closed for the final time. A station and platform were provided at Barton for the use of non-aggregate goods workings, and although intended for eventual use by passengers, the station at Barton never sold a ticket. The trackbed of the former railway was adapted into the northern carriageway of the A1(M) bypass around Darlington in 1965 with the defunct quarry at Barton being used as a motorway interchange. Accidents On 24 October 1905, a train from Darlington bound for Tebay had just left Gainford station when it derailed and slid down an embankment. Injuries were only slight, so a recovery operation was launched immediately as a Royal Train was due on the line later on the same day. The cause of the accident was due to several factors; a trackworking gang had removed a rail from the running line after misreading the timetable and not expecting the train to be there. The drivers of both locomotives (two were necessary for the ascent over Stainmore Pass) did not see the signals at danger and the explosives left on the line by the trackworking gang to warn of danger ahead, did not detonate.

Background  Gary Otte was born on December 21, 1971 in Terre Haute, Indiana. He was described as a 'very sad little boy' who began using drugs and drinking alcohol at 10 and first attempted suicide at 14. The killings took place six years later, when Otte was 20. At his October 1992 trial, Gary Otte was sentenced to death for murder. Otte's IQ was purportedly only 85, although this would not bar him from execution. Otte was involved in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Ohio's execution procedures, alongside fellow death row inmates Ronald Phillips and Raymond Tibbetts, which would ultimately be dismissed in late June 2017. Phillips' execution followed less than a month later on July 26. Otte made several last minute pleas for clemency, all of which would be rejected. These included claims that Ohio's lethal injection protocol violated the Eighth Amendment, and that his age at the time of the killings would make his execution unconstitutional. All of these claims were eventually denied.  Execution  In an order published by Ohio Governor John Kasich on May 1, 2017, Otte's execution was rescheduled from June 13, 2017, to September 13, 2017. Following the denial of all his last minute appeals, Otte was executed as scheduled on the morning of Wednesday, September 13, 2017.

As a two-year-old in 1980 she showed exceptional speed but was also temperamental and difficult to restrain. She won two minor races and finished second in both the National Stakes and the Molecomb Stakes before recording her biggest win in the Phoenix Stakes. She won one minor race from four attempts ain 1981 before being retired from racing. As a broodmare she produced several minor winners. Background Swan Princess was a \\"headstrong\\" brown mare with a small white star bred in the United Kingdom by A R Jones Morgan. As a yearling she was put up for auction and sold for 13,000 guineas. She was sent into training with Brian Swift at Loretta Lodge, Epsom She was sired by So Blessed, a sprinter who won the July Cup and the Nunthorpe Stakes as a three-year-old in 1968. HisHe stood as a breeding stallion in Europe where his other offspring included Duboff (Sun Chariot Stakes) and Honeyblest (Diadem Stakes), before being exported to Japan. Swan Princess's dam Swan Ann showed modest racing ability, winning one race in twelve attempts but was much more successful as a broodmare with her other foals including Primo Dominie who won the Richmond Stakes and sired both First Trump and Primo Valentino. Racing career 1980: two-year-old season As a two-year-old Swan Princess was campaigned exclusively over the minimum distance of five furlongs. On her debut in March she won a fifteen-runner maiden race at Doncaster Racecourse in March by a wide margin despite veering across the track in the closing stages. At Newmarket in the following month she pulled very hard on the way to the start and then ran poorly to finish third. In May at Folkestone she was better behaved and was ran out a very easy winner of the Metropole Challenge Cup. Her temperamental problems returned at Epsom later that month when she was withdrawn at the start after bolting, colliding with the running rails and injuring her jockey Lester Piggott. For the rest of the season she was taken down the start very slowly and separately from the other runners. In June at Royal Ascot she was moved up in class for the Windsor Castle Stakes and finished fourth to the Irish colt Cooliney Prince after leading until inside the final furlong. In the National Stakes she again led for most of the way being overtaken close to home and finished second to Penmarric. At Goodwood Racecourse she was matched against the season's leading two-year-old filly Marwell as well as the Queen Mary Stakes winner Pushy in the Molecomb Stakes. She showed her customary early speed to take the early lead and although she was no match for Marwell in the last furlong she kept on well to take second, four lengths clear of Pushy. In August she was sent to Phoenix Park Racecourse in Ireland for the Phoenix Stakes, a race which had been elevated to Group 1 level in the previous year. Ridden by the Welsh jockey Taffy Thomas she went to the front as usual and opened up a clear lead over her opponents. She was strongly pressed in the closing stages by the favourite Band Practice (a colt from the Dermot Weld stable) but stayed on well to win by a head. Later that month she was matched against older horses in William Hill Sprint Championship at York in which she finished sixth behind Sharpo. At the end of the year Swan Princess was rated the best two-year-old filly to race in Ireland on the Irish Free Handicap. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 106, making her eighteen-pound inferior to their best juvenile filly Marwell. In their annual Racehorses of 1980 Timeform described her as \\"an exceptionally speedy filly\\" with \\"tremendous nevous energy\\" but opined that her owners had wasted their money by entering her in the 1000 Guineas as she had no chance of staying beyond five furlongs. 1981: three-year-old season Swan Princess began her second season in a minor race over six furlongs at Folkestone in April and won by one and a half lengths from Silex. She finished unplaced in her next two races before finishing third in her final racecourse appearance. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Swan Princess became a broodmare. She produced four winners but no top-class performers. Her known foals included: *Princess Adraan, a bay filly, foaled in 1983, sired by Adraan. Failed to win in Australia. *Lord of Biscay, bay colt, 1984, by Biscay. Bred in Australia. *Tristram Princess, chestnut filly, 1986, by Sir Tristram. Unraced *Omen Victory, bay colt, 1988, by Alydar.

Thummel Caroline G. Thummel McCarthy (1873 ‚Äì November 14, 1947) and Adelaide O'Brien were the only law partnership of women practicing in the Western United States in the 1910s. Early life Thummel was born in 1873 in Phelps County, Missouri. The family moved to St. Louis, Missouri while she was an infant. Her father died while she was very young. Her mother Mary L. Gilliam, of Richmond, Virginia, and her father was Gerhardt von Thummel. She had one brother, William von Thummel, who was a civil engineer. She graduated from St. Louis High School and Teachers' College and then attended and graduated from Benton Law School, during the period when George L. Corlis was dean. Career She taught school while attending Benton Law School for four years and was admitted to the bar in 1908. She was admitted to Federal practice in September 1910. In 1910 she made the news with her statement that if women had equal opportunities with man in the industrial world, they would have a larger circle from which to choose a potential husband and would do so with more particularity, in this way decreasing the number of divorces. If instead of teaching the girl to marry at any cost, she were instructed to remain single at any cost until she could marry her mental, moral and physical equal, the census numbers might not mount so high, but the quality of the citizens would more than make up for any lack in quantity. At the beginning of her career in 1911 she declared \\"I want to be a help to widows and orphans and women whose education prevents them fighting their own battles.\\" In 1912, in occasion of the visit of Sylvia Pankhurst to St. Louis, she agreed with Pankhurst's position of wanting women to act on jury cases: \\"I agree with Miss Pankhurst a jury composed of an equal number of men and women would be the most just jury. I think a jury composed of men alone in trying a woman is liable to lean to the side of gallantry. I think the placing of an equal number of men and women on a jury would eliminate the natural chivalry existing between sex.\\" In an address before the Woman's State Bar Association, Thummel stated that \\"for persons who had committed crimes by destroying property, and those who had committed crimes against other persons, a similar sentence was unjust.\\" It was her aim to establish as near as possible a law that was for the humane interest of human beings, and in 1912 she framed a \\"Humane Bill\\", which revoluzionized the Criminal Code and which she presented to the Legislature. Thummel based her bill on facts derived from close contact with the law, saying the law did not provide adequately for certain offenses. \\"According to the present criminal laws, crimes against persons and crimes against property are largely classed together, and are subject to the same punishment. Those who commit crimes against property can make restitution ‚Äî money repaid and property restored. Crimes such as murder, assault and other crimes against the person can not be atoned for, and persons committing such crimes are so abnormal that they should be segregated and forever kept from repeating the offense. It is beyond the law to provide adequate remedy for personal injury or loss of life through crimes of another. When one man or corporation has a person punished by law for defrauding, or for deliberately stealing, they simply get revenge. The money or goods are not restored, and, so far as the man or corporation is concerned, he has gained nothing. It is claimed society is improved by the deterrent effect; but society can be improved only by improving the character of the individual. Incarceration has utterly failed to achieve the result. The effect of our criminal law upon the character of those who have paid the penalty is so exactly opposite from that designed by the law that ex-convicts are always under police espionage and are objects of suspicion immediately upon the commission of every new crime. There is no justice in the present penalties. Many guilty persons are freed through technicality. A certain man is serving a sentence for six months for stealing twenty-five cents, while another is serving the same sentence for stealing three thousand times as much. Each man should have been made to earn and repay exactly what he stole, with interest, and to pay the costs; then he should be allowed to go free. Present laws are more likely to make anarchists than anything else. \\"We should take cognizance of the fact that criminals are sick mentally and are morally depraved, and that whether the criminal tendency is the result of heredity and environment, the law should seek a remedy for the ailment. Its aim should be to cure the disease. Confinement and notoriety under unhealthy conditions is the best that is done for a person within the custody of the law. His failings are exposed to the world, his delinquencies are advertised, and thus a hatred for his countrymen and his country are fostered. He is humiliated, scorned and punished, but he is never compelled to rectify the wrong he has done. The chief end and aim of all laws should be to make better citizens. In all cases of oflfense where the wrong suffered can be reduced to a money value; that is, in all crimes affecting property, the convicted person should be sentenced to labor at the regular wage rate until he has earned a sufTicient sum to reimburse his victim and pay the costs. Under the present criminal laws, when the prison door swings open to discharge a prisoner who has paid the penalty imposed by law, it is the same thief who leaves as was taken there. Another crime which we do to one guilty of offense is to gauge his sentence by his past life. If the prisoner at the bar has previously committed a crime and atoned for it under the law, he receives a more severe sentence. This is putting him twice in jeopardy for the same offense.\\" The above ideas were embodied in a bill presented to the Legislature. The bill did not pass but commenting on it, Senator Alroy S. Phillips said: \\"It is an admirable, wise and humane measure, but our present ideas are not sufficiently advanced to enable the bill to be understood and appreciated.\\" The bill was endorsed by two other women lawyers, Adelaide E. O'Brien and Amabel Anderson Arnold. Thummel was very successful in investigations of the treatment given the workhouse prisoners, and was very active and enthusiastic in every reform movement for the benefit of suffering humanity. Thummel lectured before the law class at the City College of Law and Finance; it was the first time in St. Louis that two women, Thummel (for \\"Commercial Law\\") and O'Brien (for \\"Torts\\"), were appointed lecturers on law before classes composed of both men and women. Because the Missouri Bar Association, composed of men, barred women lawyers from its membership (although the American Bar Association admitted them), nineteen attorneys of the city have organized the \\"Woman's Bar Association of the City and State; Thummel was president and O'Brien was vice-president.\\" Its educational policy included the further study of Federal, State and Municipal Law. The vice- president, Thummel, was of the opinion that women's clubs and organizations would be spending their time very profitably if they would study law. On February 11, 1915, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Caroline Thummel McCarty and her law partner Adelaide O'Brien were the only law partnership of women practicing in the West. In October 1915, Thummel demanded to be examined for Head of Legal Aid Bureau, a position from which she was excluded due to the fact she was a woman. She lost her suit before Judge Jones who held that the Efficiency Board had the power, under the charter, to enforce rules and regulations governing examinations, so long as it acted within reason. In 1936 she ran in the Democratic party primary for Prosecuting Attorney of Warren County, Missouri; she lost in the general election to Republican Alvin H. Ju√´rgenmeyer, 1096 to 2801. She was also an accomplished poet, with several books of poems published. She collaborated with the Warrenton Banner with the column \\"Masses Creek Observations\\". At the time of her death in 1947 she was working for the Masonic Home in St. Louis. Personal life Caroline G. Thummel married William Clark McCarty (1865‚Äì1931), an attorney, morning newspaper reporter and a widower with two children, Mrs Norman Conrad and Mary McCarthy. They lived at 1036 Fairmont Ave in Saint Louis and owned a farm near Jonesburg, Missouri, the McCarty Lodge. She died on November 14, 1947, and is buried at Oak Grove Baptist Cemetery, Bridgeport, Missouri, beside her husband.

Early years and education Mary Hall Barrett was born in Malden, Massachusetts, on September 14, 1816, the daughter of William and Mary Barrett. Her mother worked among the poor of Malden. Her father, owner of the Malden Dye-House, believed in the principles of Christian Universalism. Her parents exemplified those principles at home and abroad. Rev. Dr. Sylvanus Cobb said: \\"When we commenced our pastoral charge at Malden, Mary Barrett was a girl of 12. Though her father was wealthy, and her associates were of the first class socially, she was ever modest and affable in her manners towards all. There was a combination of intellectuality and benevolence in her expression, and her highest concern was to enrich and adorn the mind. She entered heartily and efficiently into the work of the Sunday-school. Young as she was, she became a teacher and member of the Bible class. She joined the church at 16, and was ever one of the most earnest and faithful workers, and her enlightened and ever-glowing spirit of devotion added to the spiritual interest of the communion.\\" When quite young, her sister, father, brother and mother all died of consumption, and needed great care before their deaths, which Adams took upon herself to provide. Friends saw that Adams was overdoing herself and becoming frail, but her comforting was so well received by the invalids that they did not notice Adams' wasting frame. She was never a \\"rollicking school girl\\". In addition to the instruction obtained in her home town, she attended schools in Medford and Charlestown. Career In November, 1889, she married the clergymen, Rev. John Greenleaf Adams, D.D. (1810-1887) and lived for 12 years in the home of her childhood as a pastor's wife. She shared her thoughts about the marriage via letters to friends: \\"To be a clergyman's wife has from my childhood been the acme of my desire; and I regard the day of my marriage as the commencement of my duties and pleasures, in anticipation of which my heart is joyous. It may be a way of trials, vexations, grievances. Let them all come! There has been One to sustain and impart fortitude to my heart, and his hand will still guide and uphold me.\\" To another she wrote: \\"I am very sad at the thought of leaving so many dear friends, and this old home my parents lived and died in; and then, too, my dear mother, upon her dying pillow, gave into my charge my younger sisters to advise and counsel as far as was in my power, and that makes ithard indeed; but there is one whose home I am bound to bless and cheer, so think of me, dear friend, on the evening, about the time I shall stand at the altar, to promise, before God and the world, what my heart readily yields‚Äî allegiance to the laws of Christian love and a husband.\\" Sabbath-School Annual (1848) Adams edited the Sabbath-School Annual, published by Rev. James M. Usher, Boston, for three years, and through her influence the best authors of the Universalist Church filled the book with the most instructive and attractive reading for young children. In a letter to one who assisted her by sending communications, Adams wrote: \\"I never more than at present felt the necessity of well-directed efforts to keep, to win, to reclaim the young from what is wrong and unholy; to kindle a love of pure and sound instruction within them, a love of Christ and his precepts in their hearts. I know you feel with me the importance of filling our juvenile papers and books with instructive lessons in morality and religion. We must think and talk more of heaven and God. We must not leave 'Father in heaven' and 'better home' to be mentioned only in prayers and in Sunday-school. We must talk of these things in the sunlight, over the needle, around the hearth on Monday or Tuesday, and not consider them Sunday or sick-bed topics nor leave them for the minister.\\" Later life When Adams' health was lessening daily, it was thought advisable to move inland, and so Rev. Adams accepted a call from the people of Worcester, Massachusetts, and removed there in 1852. Adams, being unable to attend to household duties, remained with her Malden friends until her new home was made comfortable for her. Her health for a time seemed to improve. Her memoir says she found congenial friends in her new town. Her first communion in Worcester she describes: \\"Here for the first time I sat with stranger sisters and brothers, away from that old sanctuary where I was christened, received into the visible church, married, and where my babes have been dedicated to the service and will of the Father. Here, on new ground, amid new faces, with stranger hearts all around me, away from kindred and home, I drew near to my God and Savior for their blessings, and the communication of the influence of the Holy Spirit.\\" In 1859, Adams' health rapidly failed; in December she had an attack of pneumonia, from which she never fully recovered. In 1860, Rev. Adams received and accepted a call to the Second society in Providence, Rhode Island. Just before going there, Adams wrote to a friend: \\"I shall never drive business any more; I have turned that corner, and left it out of sight. Henceforth I am to all intents and purposes a 'slow coach.' I draw comfort, however, in contemplating the poor snail. He moves slowly, but he moves. He accomplishes his journey and work; and, by the blessing of God, I shall mine, in due time.\\" Adams died December 8, 1860 in Providence, Rhode Island, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Style and themes Among her closest friends were Sarah Carter Edgarton Mayo, Charlotte Ann Fillebrown Jerauld, Eliza Ann Bacon Lathrop, Rev. Edwin Hubbell Chapin, Rev. Thomas Starr King, Rev. Hosea Ballou, Rev. Sebastian Streeter, Dr. Hosea Ballou II, Rev. Thomas Whittemore, Rev. Lucius Robinson Paige, Rev. Otis A. Skinner, and Rev. John Wesley Hanson. Epistolary addresses written in her early life were kept among the memorials of her surviving friends. In most of these writings, there is an infusion of the religious, which was so strong a peculiarity in her character.

Synopsis The film is a rite-of-passage story of a biracial teenage girl falling in love with a member of the Hitler Youth and struggling for survival in Nazi Germany. The protagonist, Leyna, is portrayed as a German nationalist, and somewhat antisemitic. Lutz is the son of a high ranking SS officer, and is initially an enthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth. After Leyna and Lutz fall in love, she becomes pregnant. However, she gets sent to a Nazi labour camp where she must keep her pregnancy secret (as she is supposed to have been sterilized). Lutz is also stationed at the camp as an SS guard. After a bombing by the Americans, he attempts to escape with Leyna but he is killed by his father. Leyna, shocked, stays still on the ground until an American soldier comes to take her. Seven weeks later, she is heavily pregnant and she is in the displaced area where she reunites with her mother and brother.

It is native to tropical and subtropical parts of the western, central and eastern Pacific Ocean. It is susceptible to bleaching and various coral diseases and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as a \\"vulnerable species\\". Description P. elegans forms small clumps of short, thick, mostly erect branches with flattened tips. The surface of the coral has smooth rounded lobes known as verrucae (lumpy skeletal outgrowths that include several corallites) which give this genus of corals their characteristic appearance. The corallites are flat and very small and scattered over the surface of the skeleton. This coral varies in colour, often being some shade of cream, pink or greenish-brown. Similar species are Pocillopora verrucosa, which has rougher verrucae, Pocillopora grandis and Pocillopora capitata. Distribution and habitat P. elegans is native to the tropical Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra through the Central Pacific to Mexico, Central America, the Galapagos Islands and Colombia. It is found in shallow reef environments at depths down to about . Status P. elegans has a wide range and is common over much of its range, but it is particularly susceptible to bleaching, coral diseases and predation by the crown-of-thorns starfish. Before the 1982‚Äì1983 El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) event, it was, along with Pocillopora damicornis, one of the strongest and most vigorous species of reef-building corals in the eastern Pacific, but after the event, it had disappeared from many of its previous locations, although there has since been some recruitment in Costa Rica, Panama and the Galapagos Islands. In general, the reefs where it lives are under threat, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\".

It is headquartered in New York City, with offices in London and Tokyo. Description Digiday provides daily online news about advertising, publishing, and media, and also produces events such as industry summits and awards galas.Kelli S. Burns, Social Media: A Reference Handbook (2017), p. 344.Kristy Sammis, Cat Lincoln, Stefania Pomponi, Influencer Marketing For Dummies (2015), p. 238. Founder Nick Friese created the publication in April 2008. With support Doug Carlson, managing director of Zinio, Friese put together a Digital Publishing and Advertising Conference in a New York City hotel.Mediaweek (2008), Vol. 18, Issues 33-45, p. 14. Originally called DM2 Events (an abbreviation of Digital Media and Marketing Events), a colleague came up with \\"Digiday\\" as a shorter version of Friese's proposed \\"Digital- Day\\". The company depends on a variety of offerings to generate revenue, claiming that half of its revenue comes from advertising, branded content, sponsored content, and career listings, and the other half coming from hosting events and conducting awards programs. It further claims that these sources have provided \\"double-digit revenue growth\\" in the mid-to-late 2010s. Digiday also has a podcast series covering client, agency, and media perspectives.Robert Cluley, Essentials of Advertising (2017), p. 81. Fortune magazine wrote of Digiday, \\"[y]ou might not have heard of an online publication called Digiday‚Äîunless you spend all of your time reading about the media industry, and specifically the marketing side of the digital media industry, in which case you probably read it all the time\\". Bloomberg View describes Digidays \\"running series on 'confessions' from digital marketing insiders\\" as \\"a good source of frank and cynical, though anonymous, descriptions of a deeply dysfunctional business\\", for example, interviewing \\"a female ex-creative agency executive who talks about the diversity issues that still plague the industry\\". In February 2015, Fast Company named Digiday on its list of \\"The World‚Äôs Top 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2015 In Media\\", describing the company as \\"an important resource and authority in the world of digital media\\", and citing its \\"summits on the future of digital advertising\\". From 2008 to 2017, Digiday hosted over 250 events, such as the annual Digiday Mobile conference held in New York City.Rachel Pasqua, Noah Elkin, Mobile Marketing: An Hour a Day (2012), p. 324. Digiday also has a podcast series covering client, agency, and media perspectives. In 2018, Digiday provoked controversy with an article titled \\"Why agencies are skipping SXSW this year\\", which was criticized by local business figures as underestimating the relevance of the SXSW festival.Omar L. Gallaga, \\"SXSW 2018: Crowds, Crankiness --and Maybe a Lesser Role for Music\\", Austin American-Statesman (March 4, 2018) p. A1, A9. Other projects In 2014, Digiday created \\"What the Fuck is my Twitter Bio?\\", a site that generates random absurd Twitter bios followed by profanity-laced commentary, as a way to mock the tendency of Twitter users to employ certain kinds of self-promotional phrases. In May 2016, Digiday launched a new website named Glossy, helmed by Digiday staff and intended to provide coverage of fashion and luxury brands, and the impact of technology on these areas, similar to the coverage of media sites provided by Digiday. Friese stated that he \\"plans to take the same approach to Glossy as it took with Digiday\\", beginning with news reporting and eventually expanding to conferences and other events to drive revenue.

It owns and manages properties in the commercial, residential, hospitality, retail, and industrial and logistics sectors. Headquartered in Singapore, it trades on the main board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST). It also sponsors real estate investment trusts (REITs), including one stapled trust, two of which are also listed on the SGX-ST. History 1963‚Äì1996: Foundation, establishment of The Centrepoint, IPO, and acquisition by Fraser and Neave Interior of Centrepoint Shopping Centre in 2006. The company that would later be known as Frasers Property was incorporated in 1963 as Cold Storage Limited, a market and retail chain. The first property it developed was a shopping centre known as The Centrepoint located on Singapore's Orchard Road. Construction on that development started in 1980 and was completed in 1983. In the early 1980s, the firm began divesting its non-property assets. In 1987, Fraser and Neave and Goodman Fielder Wattie took control of Cold Storage Holdings, the holding group for Cold Storage's food manufacturing, retail, and property arms. In 1988, the property arm of Cold Storage became Centrepoint Properties Limited (CPL) and also started trading on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). In 1990, CPL became a member of Fraser and Neave after restructuring. At the time of the acquisition, CPL's sole function was as the owner and operator of The Centrepoint mall, and its executive director was G.H. Darwin. In the following years, the company added to its portfolio, opening another shopping complex, Northpoint, in Singapore and acquiring a Sydney, Australia- based shopping mall, Bridgepoint. In 1994, CPL opened and began managing its first residential project with The Anchorage, a condominium complex at the location of a former Anchor Brewery in Singapore. In 1996, it broke ground on its first commercial project in Vietnam called, Me Linh Point, in Ho Chi Minh City. The 21-storey retail and commercial tower was completed in 1999. In 1996, G.H. Darwin retired as executive director and was replaced by Jeffrey Heng, who assumed the role of CEO. Under Heng, Centrepoint expanded into hospitality with the hotel brands, Fraser Place and Fraser Suites. In 1998, Fraser Suites Singapore and Fraser Place Robertson Walk were the first of F&N;'s serviced residence properties. The company subsequently opened locations in the UK, South Korea, and the Philippines. The company also ventured into the United Kingdom for the first time in 2000 with the Annandale House residential development. Its first development in China came with the JingAn Four Seasons in Shanghai in 2001. 1996‚Äì2013: Further expansion, delisting from SGX, and establishment of REITs In 2002, Centrepoint Properties became a wholly owned subsidiary of Fraser and Neave, which privatized it by delisting it from the SGX. Lim Ee Seng was named CEO of Centrepoint Properties in 2004. Two years later, the company was rebranded as Frasers Centrepoint Limited (FCL). It also developed its first Real estate investment trust (REIT) with Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT). The FCT launched with a listing on the main board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST). In 2008, Fraser and Neave acquired a 17.7% stake in the Allco Commercial REIT. It was later rebranded as the Frasers Commercial Trust (FCOT) and placed under the structure of FCL. Between 2005 and 2014, FCL's assets increased from just over $5 billion to $16.89 billion (SGD). In 2013, FCL's parent company, Fraser and Neave, was acquired by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi's TCC Group for $11 billion. In August of that year, it was announced that Fraser and Neave would spin off FCL as its own separate listing on the Singapore Exchange through an in specie distribution of stock, effectively making the property group an independent entity under the broader TCC Group umbrella. 2014‚Äì2017: Acquisition by TCC Group, relisting on SGX, and expansion into Australia and Europe It officially commenced trading on the main board of the SGX-ST on January 9, 2014, after a nearly 12-year absence. In June 2014, FCL launched the Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT), a stapled trust with a focus on its hospitality business. It is listed on the SGX-ST. Another REIT, the Frasers Logistics and Industrial Trust (FLT), was launched on the SGX-ST in June 2016. In July 2014, Frasers Centrepoint acquired Australand, an Australia-based property group, for $2.6 billion (AUD). Australand was rebranded to Frasers Property Australia in August 2015. In 2016, the company acquired a stake in the Stock Exchange of Thailand-listed development company, Golden Land. In October 2016, Panote Sirivadhanabhakdi took over as the group's CEO, replacing the retiring Lim Ee Seng who had held the role for 12 years. Sirivadhanabhakdi had previously been the CEO of the Thailand-based Univentures Public Company and a non-executive and non- independent director of Frasers Centrepoint. In April 2017, it was announced that Frasers Centrepoint (in collaboration with the TCC Group) was planning the largest mixed-use development in Thailand known as One Bangkok. Due to be completed in 2025, the 16.7 hectare integrated district will feature residences, hotels, office space, and shopping malls.

Later in February, the Frasers Property Group acquired an additional 26.1% stake in Thai-listed developer, TICON Industrial Connection Public Company, in which it already owned a 40.95% share.

Located on the Bay of Cascais along the shore of the Citadel of Cascais, the marina plays host to numerous high profile sailing events, such as the America's Cup World Series, the World Match Racing Tour, and the Audi MedCup. In 2018, the city announced the marina will be redeveloped, featuring a ‚Ç¨60 million green roofs scheme, that when complete would be a mixed-use luxury and environmentally conscious destination.  History  Cascais Marina has over 650 mooring stations, 125 of which are reserved for short stopovers. View of Santa Marta Lighthouse from the marina. The marina has over 20,000 m2 of entertainment space, regularly hosting luxury and high profile events. The Marina was planned both as a base for boats cruising the coast and wanting to visit Lisbon as well as for the boats of the local inhabitants, for which there were inadequate moorings in Cascais. The concession for the construction and operation of the marina was awarded for 75 years to a private company, by contract with the Portuguese State, on September 21, 1995. There were considerable criticisms of the development. These centered on the potential environmental impact; the change to the nature of the landscape; and the difficulty in predicting the behavior of the currents, especially with regard to the deposit of sand, potentially forming new beaches and removing others. Such fears came, in part, to be realised, particularly in regard to the visual impact of the marina on the cove of Santa Marta, and the Casa de Santa Maria and the Santa Marta Lighthouse on the cove‚Äôs banks. In addition, it has been argued that the chosen architectural model collides with that of the old walls of the Citadel, situated immediately above the marina and that the commercial areas of the marina, such as shops and restaurants, are unattractive and should be rebuilt. Proponents of the marina argue that it has not affected the visual appeal of Cascais, that all the surrounding historical and architectural heritage was preserved and carefully integrated, and that it has led to further regeneration of the area, particularly in the citadel.  Organization  Cascais Marina has 650 mooring stations able to receive vessels up to 36 meters in length. Of these berths, 125 are reserved for short stopovers. The marina was officially opened on 6 August 1999. It has a total area available for events of 20,000m2 of open, multi-use spaces and has hosted several important sailing events, such as the America‚Äôs Cup World series, the Swedish Match Tour, the Audi MedCup (2010 and 2011), the 2007 ISAF Sailing World Championships, and the 49er & 49er FX World Championships. The marina is also used for non-sailing events, such as the Ironman 70.3.

Originally published in 2010, Richards's book of gloomy tales pokes fun at the absurdities of life. Humor The book is largely compared to Edward Gorey and Tim Burton but characteristically weaves a deeper expression of sentiment not found in his earlier collection. Richards relates how the title story has been perceived by the readers: Some have thought of it as giving insight into some sort of pagan beliefs. One commented it was a metaphor for the Celtic Tree of Life. The little girl upstairs represents an above plane while 'Rune' resides in the below or Otherworld, and the remaining between provides the journey towards consciousness of spirit and self-interconnected. I will not say if these are accurate or intentional in any way, but obviously, the story itself was meant to fascinate adults as well as children, and like one reviewer mentioned, this story is fundamentally about finding oneself. Further reading reveals Zoog is a vampire who is hiding his allergy to blood and is found staring at a rainbow, while a woman accidentally feeds her 100 cats a sponge instead of cheese, and a man questions his existence only to be mistaken for a garden gnome.

The cover was in a light blue background with an illustration of Ruin from the title story, who appears to be wearing several cultural tokens. A paperback edition of the book was released in 2014 with a cover showing Rune (Ruin) with a rat teaching him how to write, and the young vampire Zoog behind him.

An article in Gizmodo by Brent Rose describes it as the \\"most popular legit cocktail that uses fernet\\". It is named after the Canadian city of Toronto. History It was first recorded as the Fernet Cocktail in Robert Vermeire's 1922 edition of Cocktails: How to Mix Them, in which he stated that the \\"cocktail is much appreciated by the Canadians of Toronto\\". Because the importation of alcoholic beverages to Ontario was banned as a result of the 1921 prohibition referendum, a reliable source for the Italian-made fernet would not have been readily available. It is unclear whether the Torontonians referenced by Vermeire obtained the drink in Toronto before prohibition, or at his bar in London, England. By 1930, it was listed as the Toronto Cocktail in Cocktail Bill Boothby's World Drinks And How To Mix Them by William \\"Cocktail\\" Boothby. The recipes by Vermeire and Boothby both listed equal measures of rye whisky and Fernet-Branca. In 1948, it was listed as the Toronto Cocktail in the book The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks by David A. Embury, and in 1949 a recipe for the Toronto Cocktail was included in Esquire's Handbook for Hosts. Description The Toronto Cocktail is a variation of the Old Fashioned, with the addition of Fernet-Branca. Variations of the cocktail substitute various rye whiskeys as the primary ingredient, such as Canadian whisky or Old Overholt. The Fernet Cocktail recipe by Vermeire specified of cognac or rye whisky, and gill of Fernet-Branca. The rye whisky complements the bitter Fernet-Branca and prevents it from dominating the cocktail. Sugar or simple syrup are used to reduce the cocktail's bitterness. It may be served in a cocktail glass or coupe glass, and served with an orange slice or twist. It may also be served with ice in an old fashioned glass. It has a rich flavour with a mild bitterness.

Founded in 2016 by Jeff Clements, the former assistant attorney general of Massachusetts, and author of Corporations Are Not People: Reclaiming Democracy From Big Money and Global Corporations, American Promise advocates for campaign finance reform in the United States. Ballot initiatives and resolutions Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2010's Citizens United v. FEC, grassroots organizations have helped 20 states and over 800 cities and towns to pass resolutions calling on Congress to propose a 28th Amendment to overturn that ruling. Voters in Montana, Colorado, California, and Washington have passed resolutions by voter instruction or ballot initiative with significant cross-partisan support. Since its launch in 2016, American Promise has engaged in statewide efforts in Wyoming and Massachusetts to put initiatives on the ballot in 2018. 28th Amendment Pledge The American Promise Candidate Pledge asks local, state and federal candidates and elected officials to pledge to use their office to advance the 28th Amendment to secure fair and free elections by limiting the amount of money spent to influence elections. Ready to ratify In states that have passed voter instructions or ballot initiatives calling on Congress to pass the 28th Amendment, American Promise works with citizens to prepare their state for the ratification of the 28th Amendment. In states like Colorado, Montana, California, and Washington, they are working to pass local resolutions asking their elected officials to follow the will of the voters. In Massachusetts, a local affiliate group called People Govern, Not Money is leading an all-volunteer effort to place an initiative of the 2018 ballot that would ask voters to create a volunteer 15 member cross-partisan citizens commission that would be tasked with advancing policies to amend the U.S. Constitution to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC. National Citizenship Leadership Conference Jeff Clements (left), President of American Promise, presenting Congressman Walter Jones with a Congressional Leadership Award In 2016, hundreds of people from across the country traveled to Washington, D.C. for the first annual National Citizen Leadership Conference. The keynote speakers included Former Representative Jim Leach, Former Representative Donna Edwards, and Former State Senator Nina Turner. At the Conference, American Promise gave out four Congressional Leadership Awards and four Citizen Leadership Awards. Congressional Leadership Awards The Congressional Leadership Awards recognize leaders in Congress who are committed to building cross-partisan alliances to advance a 28th Amendment to the Constitution to overturn Citizens United v. FEC Recipients of the first annual Congressional Leadership Award include: * retired Congressman Jim Leach (R-IA) * Congresswomen Donna Edwards (D-MD) * Congressman Walter Jones (R-NC) * Congressman Jim McGovern (D-MA) Advisory council American Promise's cross-partisan advisory council includes Doris Kearns Goodwin, former state senator Nina Turner, John Pudner, Ben Cohen, Donnel Baird, Judy Wicks, former Congressman Jim Leach, Justice James C.

It is the eldest park in the city. The park was established in 1832 on 9 ha city-owned land. It is located in the south-east of Novocherkassk between Platovsky avenue (Alexander Garden North), Aleksandrovskaya street (Alexander Garden South), Pushkinskaya (Alexander Garden West) and Atamanskaya street (Alexander Garden East). History Platovsky avenue and a railing of Alexander garden (on the right) in the early 1900s The park was established on a former Aleksndrovskaya square. The new park occupied south part of the square. Right side of the park (so-called Children's Park) has survived to this day. Visitor attractions included two barrows and stone arch. Alexander garden's viewing point on the barrow attracted visitors. It offered views of the Don steppe. The viewing point was decorated with open-work wooden arbor. The park consisted of lime tree walks with mixture of sand and sawdust. There were benches along walkways. A lot of musicians performed on a podium. Monument to Matvey Platov was opened in 1853 alongside of the main park entrance. Platov founded Novocherkassk in 1805. The monument was the first sculpture in the city. The Ataman palace was built behind the monument in 1863. The first fountain was erected after commissioning of water pipe in Novocherkassk in 1865. Appearance of the park was complemented by a delicate iron-cast railing which was designed by architect Radionov. The grille was suspended between iron columns crowned with round bent caps. In 1881 two small chapels in a Russian Revival style was built over the gate overlooking Platovsky avenue. The Saint Alexander church was erected near the south end of the park in 1892-96. It was designed by architect N. Anuhin. Wooden church in this place was disassembled. The chapels were destroyed after the establishment of the Soviet rule in Novocherkassk. Sculpture of Matvey Platov was replaced by Lenin's statue in 1923. Gostiny dvor in the park was partially demolished during the Second World War. The resulting wasteland initial was occupied by a stadium, then by the buildings of the city administration, department store and restaurant. Outdoor cinema 'Udarnick', —Åafe 'Vesna' and dance floor were erected in the 1950-60s. Main entrance to the park was decorated with arch upon the project architect N. Gladkih. He projected also colonnades in front of the cinema and cafe. The ancient railing was dismantled in the 1970. A ferris wheel was established in Children's Park at this period. Monument to Matvey Platov Alexander garden was the scene of the confrontation between workers of Novocherkassk locomotive plant and army units. Strike of workers eventually culminated in riots of June 1‚Äì2, 1962 in front of the Ataman palace when reportedly 26 protesters were killed by Soviet Army troops. The barrow is crowned with a memorial complex. It was erected in honor of those who defended southern Russia. The opening ceremony of the monument took place in 1985 and was held in conjunction 35-year anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War. Monument to Matvey Platov was re-established on the historical place in 1993.  Points of interest  The Ataman palace from Palace Square in Alexander garden * Monument to Matvei Platov (1853, was reerected in 1993), a sculpture of founder of Novocherkassk designed by sculptor Peter Clodt and architect A.

It proved to be Jerauld; both gentlemen complimented her, and Clay said, \\"I wish you were a boy; I would make a statesman of you.\\" Career At the age of 15 years, she was compelled to support herself, and her preference was to go where she could have something to do with books, and consequently she entered a book-bindery, and it proved to be the place where the Ladies' Repository was bound, and owing to this fact, perhaps, her first essay for publication was sent to that periodical. In 1841, Jerauld published her first prose. Previous to this, she had published some poetry, but this was the real beginning of her literary life. It was entitled \\"Emma Beaumont,\\" and exalted the spirit of self-sacrifice in the daughter. Her pictures of life and character were always drawn from the world. With her second story, \\"Margaret Leslie,\\" came a note, stating that the enclosed story was founded on facts, the heroine having been personally known to her. Of it, Edgarton said it, \\"almost cheated her into the belief that the plot was real, which is a proof of no ordinary skill.\\" Her contributions to the Repository became now quite frequent, ‚Äî every issue presented something written by Jerauld. This developed into a new existence for her. Poetry and prose In 1842, she passed a week in Lowell, with Edgarton, at the home of Thomas Baldwin Thayer, and here she enjoyed her First Communion. In the winter of 1842, she attended a course of lectures delivered by Richard Henry Dana Sr., on \\"Woman\\", Macbeth, Shakespeare in the supernatural, and Hamlet. These quickened her perceptions of literature, and sent her to reading Shakespeare, Spenser and Milton. On November 19, 1843, she married J. W. Jerauld, and subsequently she divided her time between domestic duties and literary pursuits, producing most of the stories, sketches and poems found in the volume Poetry and Prose, by Mrs. Charlotte A. Jerauld, with a memoir by Henry Bacon, Boston. A. Tompkins, 88 Cornhill, 1860, which first appeared in the Repository and Rose of Sharon. Much of the development of her genius was due to the influence of Rev. Henry Bacon. Jerauld's friends included Sarah Carter Edgarton Mayo and Mary Hall Barrett Adams. A singular instance of unity of thought between Jerauld and Mayo led to the best expression of their similarity of poetic feeling and religious tone. It was given in the series of Sonnets on the Lord's Prayer, written by them. Each had written a sonnet on a portion of the prayer, unknown to the other, with the intention of composing a series; and when published, the suggestion came from Mayo that they should write on alternate portions of that prayer, and thus mutually form a series of sonnets. They completed the work in 1844. Personal life and death On the last week of July, 1845, her child was born; on the third day after, her mind wandered, her thoughts were disconnected and confused. In a few hours, she became a raving maniac. Her child died August 1, and Charlotte died on August 2nd. Jeralud and her infant were buried together in the same coffin.

It was discovered on 31 October 2005, by astronomers of the Spacewatch survey at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, United States. Its minor-planet moon with an orbital period of 40.25 hours was discovered in 2017.  Orbit and classification  is an Amor asteroid that approaches the orbit of Earth from beyond but does not cross it. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.1‚Äì3.1 AU once every 3 years and 1 month (1,124 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.47 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery image taken by NEAT at Palomar Observatory in November 2002, almost four years prior to its official discovery observation. Due to its high eccentricity, the asteroid is also a Mars-crosser, which means that it also crosses the orbit of Mars (at 1.666 AU).  Close approaches  This near-Earth object has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which corresponds to 51.3 lunar distances. On 10 July 2017, it approached Earth to a distance of 0.133 AU and will make its next close approach at 0.128 AU in July 2057.  Physical characteristics  is an assumed S-type asteroid.  Rotation period  Since 2004, several rotational lightcurves of were obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomers David Romeuf, Ren√© Roy, as well as by American astronomer Brian Warner. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve gave a rotation period of 40.542 hours with a brightness variation of 1.1 magnitude (). While not being a slow rotator, has a much longer rotation period than most asteroids, especially for it nearly sub-kilometer size. The lightcurve's high brightness amplitude also indicates that the body has a non-spheroidal shape.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, measures 1.045 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.234, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 1.08 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 17.2. The asteroid has an estimated density of 1.8 g/cm3.  Binary system  In May 2017, photometric observations by Brian Warner and Alan Harris revealed that is a synchronous binary system with a secondary component orbiting around the system barycenter every 40.572 hours. The secondary has been confirmed by radar observations. Its provisional designation is .  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 19 August 2008. As of 2018, it has not been named. Up to 1900 a few hundred, and by the 1990s asteroids had been discovered and named progressing from almost planet like notoriety to one of thousands; the advent of many thousands of discoveries in the 21 century has resulted in many hundreds of thousands of unnamed minor planets.

The organisation has been subject to continuous harassment by the Egyptian authorities after reporting on human rights abuses by the el-Sisi government. ECRF is one of the very few human rights organisations still operating inside a country increasingly hostile to dissent and in which countless civil society organisations have been forced to close. The commission coordinates campaigns for those who have been tortured or disappeared, as well as highlighting numerous incidences of human rights abuses. Founders * Ahmed Abdallah, Chairman of the Board of Trustees. * Mohamed Lotfy, Executive Director. * Mohamed Sameh, International Relations Advisor. Human rights campaigns ECRF started operating in September 2013 as a membership based human rights organisation mainly conducting trainings to activists on the basic concepts of human rights, skills of documentation of violations, strategic campaigning, and legal awareness-raising. These were received by youth activists who requested more engagement into human rights advocacy. Believing that all human beings are capable of defending human rights in their local communities, ECRF focuses on coordinating and accompanying the activists' energy to collectively work on the pressing issues of civil, political, economic, or social rights. This approach aims at documenting and mitigating human rights violations, raising civil awareness and community participation in human rights and development efforts. ECRF tracks forced disappearances in the country. These have spiked since General Abdel-Fatah Al-Sisi came to power in 2013. The Commission investigates the unauthorised use of military camps in the country for the detention of civilians. These could be held outside of judicial oversight in secret military prisons. On June 2014, The Guardian published a long article on the Azouli military jail in the Suez Canal area: \\"Prisoners at Azouli are routinely electrocuted, beaten and hanged naked by their tied wrists for hours until they either give up specific information, memorise confessions or until ‚Äì in the case of a small group of released former inmates ‚Äì are deemed of no further use to their interrogators.\\" On June 2017, ECRF published a detailed report on the Galaa Military Prison and described how civilian detainees are treated and interrogated by different security agencies including the national security, military police, military intelligence and referred to military trials in the Galaa court, situated inside the complex. Lawyers connected to ECRF are also acting as the Egyptian legal counsel for the family of murdered Italian Giulio Regeni, whose body bearing signs of torture was found on a desert road outside Cairo on 3 February 2016. Harassment and arrests On 2 June 2015, Mohamed Lotfy, ECRF executive director, an Egyptian-Swiss National, was banned at Cairo International Airport from travelling to Germany and had his passport confiscated. He was on his way to Berlin invited by the Greens Party to participate in a discussion panel on the deteriorating human rights situation in Egypt at the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag). Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have continuously called on the Egyptian authorities to lift the abusive and arbitrary travel bans. His speech was still read at the Bundestag: \\"I wish i could be with you to speak on behalf of thousands who languish in inhumane conditions in jail for their political beliefs, opinions and affiliation, on whom the world knows little. My travel ban cuts a long story short, in Egypt only one voice is allowed and any critical voice is silenced. You can still hear us not because the government allows us to speak but because Egyptians continue to strive for a democratic nation that respects fundamental rights.\\" On 25 April 2016, Ahmed Abdallah, the Chairman of the board of trustees was arrested at his home. He was accused of various charges that could have resulted in him being jailed for life. He was released in September 2016 after having spent 140 days in pre-trial detention. Mohamed Lotfy and French Ambassador St√©phane Romatet during the Franco-German Award Ceremony On 20 October 2016, Egyptian authorities raided the office of the ECRF in Giza. Early morning on that day, four men ‚Äî claiming to be affiliated with the Investment Authority ‚Äî barged into the headquarters of ECRF and began searching the office without presenting a search warrant. Upon leaving the ECRF office, the four men threatened to close down the organisation and left without physically harming anyone in the process. Between 10 and 29 September 2020, ECRF documented how the Egyptian police arrested between 571 and 735 individuals in 17 governorates, amid the nationwide anti-corruption protests and published an open-source online database with their names and location of arrest. Awards Mohamed Sameh and Ahmed Abdallah of ECRF with the 2018 Freedom of Expression Award for Campaigning. Photo: Sean Gallagher/Index on Censorship In April 2018, ECRF received the annual 2018 award of Index on Censorship for Campaigning for Freedom of Expression. Selected from over 400 public nominations and a shortlist of 16, the 2018 Freedom of Expression Awards Fellows which exemplify courage in the face of censorship were awarded to ECRF from Egypt for Campaigning, the Museum of Dissidence from Cuba for Arts, Habari from DRC for Digital Activism and to Wendy Funes from Honduras for journalism. On 21 November 2018, France and Germany announced that Mohamed Lotfy, executive director of ECRF, was chosen along with 14 other human rights defenders in the world to receive the Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and Rule of Law of 2018. On 24 September 2020, ECFR was awarded the Rafto Prize by the Rafto Foundation for Human Rights for \\"their persistence in bravely resisting Egypt's state of fear\\". In the same month, ECFR was nominated by the Government of the Netherlands for the Dutch Human Rights Tulip 2020. ECRF was nominated together with 12 human rights organisations worldwide.

They were formed in 2011 by singer and rhythm guitarist Martin J. Pol√°k, lead guitarist Tom√°≈° Ondra, bassist Dominik Zavadil and drummer Dominik Kub√≠k. In 2014 Winc Janeƒçek replaced Dominik Kub√≠k, and in 2015 David Havelka replaced Dominik Zavadil. In 2018 Filip Bur≈°√≠k replaced Tom√°≈° Ondra, forging the current lineup. Without being signed to any label, the band gained a significant following with their 2015 debut album Amassed Sickness, and the following grew bigger with their 2016 release, an EP called False Flag. Currently, the band is on tour supporting their newest album, titled All Walls Will Fall. History Early years (2011‚Äì2013) In 2011, two high school friends Martin J. Pol√°k and Tom√°≈° Ondra, then aged 15 and 16, started the band under the name Green Talent, inspired by their two favorite bands, Green Day and Billy Talent. They started playing covers of various punk songs together. At this time, they were joined by drummer Dominik Kub√≠k, and as they've started writing their own songs, they changed their name to \\"These Days\\", and shortly after that to \\"Dangers!\\". With this lineup, they started playing small shows around their town, and in February 2013, they've recorded a very short demo consisting of two songs, Described in the Shadows and Drop Dead. This demo was never released and the songs were later re-recorded for their debut album. The Desperate Mind and Symptoms of the Ignition EP (2014‚Äì2015) In late 2013 and early 2014, the band, still under the name \\"Dangers!\\" started writing songs for their debut EP. In June 2014, the band, still a three-piece, performed a set of 5 new songs at a charity festival You Dream, We Run in their hometown of Blansko. Later that month, they were joined by Dominik Zavadil, who filled in the empty bass guitar spot, and the band changed their name for the final time to \\"The Desperate Mind\\". In July 2014, the band started planning a tour with Reservoar Dogz, a hard rock band from Brno. The tour, named To Hell And Back Tour 2014‚Äì2015, was set to start in September 2014, starting in Brno and continuing in other major cities of the Czech Republic up until March 2015. The start of the tour was delayed by a month because of the departure of Dominik Kub√≠k, who parted his ways with the band because the tour time conflicted with his personal life. He was replaced with Winc Janeƒçek in September 2014, and the tour kicked off on October 4, 2014. On October 31st, 2014 the band has entered the studio to record their debut EP, titled Symptoms of the Ignition, which came out on November 2, 2014 and consisted of three songs, Welcome To Your Nightmare, Rest and Searching For The Hysteria. The band spent the rest of the year on tour. Brief hiatus and Amassed Sickness (2015) After the end of To Hell And Back Tour in March 2015, the band went on a 6-month hiatus, to finish their graduation year in high school. In July, Martin J. Pol√°k has announced via his Facebook that the hiatus is over, and that the band will play a show in Prague on August 5. After the show, The Desperate Mind have announced that they are entering the studio again, this time to record their debut full length, Amassed Sickness. The album, consisting of 11 songs (including re-recorded versions of the debut EP songs), came out on September 15, 2015 and was one of the best rated debut albums of the year, with Punknews.org giving it a rating of 7/10, and Sputnikmusic giving it 4.5/5. In November 2015, the band has parted ways with Dominik Zavadil, citing musical differences, and replaced him with David Havelka. The band then played a few shows in support of their debut album from Fall 2015 to mid 2016, with their first over the border shows in 2016 in Austria and Germany. False Flag EP and Tour, The Great Delusion Single and The Great Delusion Tour (2016‚Äì2019) In February 2016, the band members announced that they are working on a new material via their social media accounts, with Martin J. Pol√°k stating that the band is changing their sound to \\"NOFX and Anti-Flag influenced melodic hardcore punk rock\\". In the summer of 2016, The Desperate Mind have revealed via their official Facebook page that they are recording a new EP, titled False Flag, which was released on December 17, 2016. This release saw the band move towards a more melodic hardcore punk rock sound, with the lyrics focusing on political and social issues. The band teamed up with Pennsylvania based artist Douglas Dean (who had previously designed the album art for Anti-Flag and Less Than Jake) for the album art. In January 2017, the band went on their first European tour called \\"False Flag Tour 2017\\", starting in Cologne, Germany on January 28 and ending on October 6 in Prague, Czech Republic. This tour saw the band play on their first bigger open air festivals, for example Seefest* in Stuttgart, Germany. The Desperate Mind also appeared in numerous magazines and music compilations, including the Ox Fanzine's Ox Compilation #131 with their song The Syringe, and in the July issue of the biggest Czech music magazine Rock&Pop.; On October 6, 2017, the band has finished the tour. In January 2018, Filip Bur≈°√≠k replaced Tom√°≈° Ondra and the band started working on a new material for their second studio album. In February 2018, the band announced that a new tour, titled \\"The Great Delusion 2018\\", will begin on March 3, 2018 with a double show in Brno, Czech Republic with Booze & Glory and Death On Arrival.. On August 19, 2018 their new single, \\"The Great Delusion\\" was released. In September 2018 the band has announced that they will be filming a music video for \\"The Great Delusion\\". The filming started on October 24, 2018 and the music video was released on December 19, 2018. On December 29, Martin J. Pol√°k revealed that \\"The Great Delusion Tour\\" will continue into 2019 via his instagram account. The 2019 part of the tour saw the band perform in the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia, started on January 5 in Prague and ended on November 22 in Brno. All Walls Will Fall (2020‚Äìpresent) On April 17, 2019 The Desperate Mind have announced that they will be entering the recording studio to record and subsequently release their second full length album, titled \\"All Walls Will Fall\\". Once again, the band has teamed up with Douglas Dean, who designed the album and merchandise art. The album was released on February 28, 2020 and the band has announced that a tour, titled 2020 All Walls Will Fall Tour will begin on March 14, 2020. However due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tour was postponed to June 12, 2020. Band members Current members * Martin J.

This anthropophilic dermatophyte can lead to diseases such as tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris, tinea corporis and onychomycosis. Diagnostic approaches of the fungal infection include physical examination, culture testing, and molecular detection. Topical antifungal treatment, such as the use of terbinafine, itraconazole, voriconazole, and ketoconazole, is often effective. E. floccosum is one of the 2 species in the genus Epidermophyton. During the 20th century, this species was the fourth most common cause of dermatophytosis in North America. This ascomycete has a worldwide distribution but is more commonly isolated from patients in tropical and subtropical areas. The non-soil associated fungus has no specific growth conditions and shows characteristic smooth club-shaped macroconidia under the microscope. History and taxonomy The fungus was first isolated in 1870 from a tinea cruris patient in Germany by Carl Otto Harz, who named it Acrothecium floccosum. Being unaware of Harz's work, Castellani and Sabouraud identified the species again in 1905 and 1907, respectively, and both placed the fungus into the genus Epidermophyton. Epidermophyton is one of the three dermatophyte fungal genera; it is distinct from the other two genera (Microsporum and Trichophyton) for the absence of microconidia. In 1930, based on the principle of priority, Langeron and Milochevitch renamed the fungus Epidermophyton floccosum to recognize Harz's contribution in identifying the species first, as well as his extensive morphological descriptions. Another fungus, originally named Epidermophyton stockdaleae, is a dark-brown, soil- inhabiting species that is morphologically and molecularly distinct to E. floccosum for its longer conidia and 7% NaCl tolerance. E. stockdaleae is also clinically differentiated from E. floccosum by its ability in perforating hair. Due to the presence of microconidia, E. stockdaleae is now considered a synonym of Trichophyton ajelloi, hence E. floccosum is currently the only species in the genus Epidermophyton. Growth and morphology The filamentous non-soil associated fungus does not require any specific growth condition in culture. E. floccosum does not grow on urease culture, has low osmotolerance, and is unable to form perforating organs. The colonies have khaki suede-like flat surfaces and grow moderately rapidly, reaching maturity within 10 days. The reverse is reddish-brown. Colonies are initially flat, but the centre of which later becomes raised and folded, with the periphery submerged. On rich media like Sabouraud agar, colonies usually degenerate into white pleomorphic tufts within several weeks, and sometimes exude a red-brown pigment into its agar. E. floccosum has septate, hyaline hyphae. Its key features are the smooth, thin-walled, club-shaped macroconidia and the absence of microconidia. The macroconidia are borne singly or in clusters of 2 or 3; they are 20‚Äì40 Œºm in length and 7‚Äì12 Œºm in width, consisting of 1 to 9 septa. The narrow base and broad, club-shaped apex of the macroconidium have been compared in shape to a beaver tail. The fungus reproduces asexually through chlamydoconidia, which are resting spores that are abundant in culture. Arthroconidia are also abundant in the culture, emerging as swollen cells alongside macroconidia formation; these thick-walled spores are resistant to heat and drying conditions. Pathology Infection E. floccosum causes superficial diseases such as tinea pedis (athlete's foot) and tinea cruris, and less commonly tinea corporis and onychomycosis. Similar to other fungal dermatophytes, E. floccosum can invade keratinized tissues including skin and nails. A recent clinical case has also demonstrated its capacity of infecting eyes, causing keratitis. It does not perforate hair or hair follicles. This anthropophilic dermatophyte preferentially infects humans and rarely infects animals, thus lab animal experiments are found to be unsuccessful. E. floccosum is more infective than most dermatophytes. Chronic infections are rare, therefore maintenance of the species relies on rapid transmission between hosts. The infection typically stays within the nonliving conidified layer of host epidermis, since the fungus cannot pierce through living tissues of individuals with normal immunity. However, it has been found to cause invasive infections in immunocompromised patients, demonstrating severe onychomycosis, skin lesions, and subcutaneous nodules. Spread E. floccosum can remain viable for long periods of time by producing arthroconidia in skin scales. Arthroconidia are thick-walled spores with higher resistance to drying and heat conditions than mycelium. Arthroconidia formation allows E. floccosum to survive for years in showers, baths, swimming pools, towels, blankets, sheets, shoes and other clothings. The fungus commonly spreads by contact in showers and gym facilities. Treatment In vitro studies have found that several agents are effective against E. floccosum. Disease-specific topical treatments for E. floccosum-related infections are usually effective, commonly with the use of terbinafine, itraconazole, and ketoconazole. Diagnosis * When causing the same disease, clinical demonstrations of E. floccosum are generally indistinguishable from other dermatophytes, except for tinea pedis: infections involving E. floccosum can demonstrate marked scaling in patient's toe and sole and produce punctate lesions nearby. Brownish macules could derive from some of these lesions. Traditionally, diseases are diagnosed with physical and Wood's lamp examinations. Unlike some Microsporium species, Epidermophyton, as well as Trichophyton do not fluoresce under the ultraviolet light of a Wood's lamp. Fungal cultures further distinguish Epidermophyton from other dermatophytes based on the absence of microconidia. Molecular advances have decreased the time of identification from 3‚Äì4 weeks to 3‚Äì4 days. Samples obtained from patient nail, hair, and skin scale can undergo PCR-RFLP, which distinguishes between 12 dermatophyte species based on their individual restriction enzyme profiles, including one for E. floccosum. A real time PCR protocol is also available for the specific detection of E. floccosum, allowing identification as fast as 4 hours after sample lysis. Habitat E. floccosum has a worldwide distribution but is more commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas. Historical fungal infections have been reported in US military in Vietnam and British Army in Southeast Asia. E. floccosum was considered the fourth most common cause of dermatophytosis in North America. Accounting for around 20 percent US cases and 44 percent Asian cases, it is also the third most common cause of tinea pedis worldwide, following Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum. * References Parasitic fungi Arthrodermataceae Fungi described in 1930 ","title":"Epidermophyton floccosum"},{"id":"55229123","text":"Antonio Cabral Bejarano (31 October 1798 ‚Äì 1 August 1861) was a Spanish painter, considered to be an adherent of both the Europe-wide Romantic painting and the specifically Hispanic painting school of Costumbrismo. His ancestors for several earlier generations were painters, and he was initially trained by his father. He was mainly active in his native city of Seville, getting many commissions from its municipal government. He was the first Director of the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville.  Early life  He was born in Seville. His great-grandfather was the painter Diego Bejarano. He had a daughter named Maria Bejarano, who married Pedro Cabral. From this marriage was born the painter Joaquin Cabral Bejarano, a well-known painter of neoclassic style. In 1785 Joaqu√≠n married Escol√°stica P√©rez Junquitu Fern√°ndez. It was of this marriage that Antonio Cabral Bejarano was born in 1798. Being baptized in the church of San Pedro as Antonio Joaqu√≠n Mar√≠a de Todos los Santos Ignacio de Loyola Quint√≠n, he would later renounce his maternal surnames, to use only those of his father.  Career  He received art training from his father. In 1812, after French invaders were forced to evacuate Seville, classes resumed at la Escuela de Tres Nobles Artes (School of Three Noble Arts) and Antonio Cabral entered as a student. In 1814 he collaborated with his father in the decoration of the convent of the Trinity and, in 1816, in the decoration of the General Archive of the Indies, which at the time was also a consular court. This decoration of the Archive of the Indies was made on the occasion of the passage through the city of the Portuguese pricesses Mar√≠a Isabel de Braganza and Francisca de Braganza, on their way to Madrid to marry, respectively, King Fernando VII and his brother Carlos Mar√≠a Isidro . In 1819 he helped to build a funeral catafalque in the Cathedral of Seville in memory of the same Maria Isabel de Braganza, who tragically died in childbirth after only two years of marriage. He also made an engraving showing the catafalque for the cover of a book on the event. In 1820 he designed for the city council of Seville the decoration of a monument commemorating the Constitution of 1812.

He taught one of the first gay studies courses in the United States. The LGBT and AIDS activist Cleve Jones, a friend of both Amador and Harvey Milk, portrayed Amador in the biographical film Milk (2008). Early life Don Amador was born as Donald Grace on October 23, 1942, in Troy, New York. He reported \\"knowing he was different\\" while growing up; his first homosexual experience occurred at age 11. At 17 years old, he left high school and joined the United States Navy, serving in the Vietnam War. He was honorably discharged and went for one year to a monastery before leaving to join an ecumenical project in Boston. He reenlisted in 1965 and worked with Chief Richard J. Amador, a recent widower whose only son had died in the Invasion of Normandy. In 1971, the chief legally adopted him. At his adopted father's insistence, Don Amador returned to school, eventually achieving a master's degree in urban anthropology. His thesis focused on the gay community in Los Angeles. Career Beginning in 1976, Don Amador taught one of the United States' first gay studies courses, at California State University. In his gay history course, Amador argued that King David, Alexander the Great, Michelangelo Buonarotti and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky were gay and taught that Thomas Jefferson framed a Virginia bill in 1776 to make homosexuality \\"punishable by castration\\". He also distinguished between the terms \\"homosexuality\\" and \\"gay\\": \\"Homosexual is merely what you do in bed; being gay is an entire life-style on its own.\\" Amador collected 14 of the best papers of his course to create a pioneering book in gay studies. Amador was named \\"official liaison to the gay community\\" by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. In 1977, he ran for the California State Assembly, polling seventh out of 18 candidates. In 1980, he ran for the Los Angeles City Council. \\"I want to be a role model for gay people,\\" Amador said. \\"Someday I hope there will be equal rights for all. We shall overcome.\\" Personal life Don Amador, his husband Tony Karnes, and Harvey Milk Beginning in 1970, Amador was in a relationship with Tony Karnes. They considered themselves married and had a wedding ceremony on the steps of the Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, Hollywood. The couple, together with Amador's adoptive father, Richard J. Amador, lived in a mansion built for the actress Mary Miles Minter. His father died in 1983 at 80 years old and is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Don Amador died on August 13, 1992. Legacy Cleve Jones, a friend of his, portrayed Amador in biographical film Milk (2008), while Jones is portrayed by Emile Hirsch.

Built in 1897, it was located at 65 and 67 Stoke Newington Road where the present-day Alexandra Court now stands. The theatre was demolished in the 1960s. History Opened on December 27, 1897 as The Alexandra Theatre and Opera House, it was designed by theatre architect Frank Matcham for F. W. Purcell. Upon opening, the theatre had a capacity of 2,025, spread across pit, traditional circle and gallery seating. In 1904, city records list the theatre‚Äôs capacity as 1,710, along with an assessed value of ¬£1,250. The theatre's first performance was the December 27, 1897 staging of Dick Whittington, an adaption of the pantomime Dick Whittington and His Cat. The theatre was operated by F. W. Purcell until 1905 when he sold it to new owners. The theatre‚Äôs new owners changed its name to the Palace Theatre of Varieties. However, in 1909, it was sold again, this time to Stoll Moss Empires, Ltd., who reverted it back to its original name, the Alexandra Theatre and placed it under the management of Oswald Stoll. In the late 1910s Stoll had screens, projectors and other equipment needed for cinema projection installed and by 1922 cine-variety programs were being presented to audiences. The theatre also presented film matinees and on Sundays, on which, by law, no live performances could be done, the theatre screened films exclusively. In 1932, the Alexandra was purchased by Standard Cinema Properties Ltd. and converted to screen films exclusively. However, in 1934 the theatre came under independent management and, in addition to reverting to featuring a mixture of live and film performances, a modern (for the time) sound system was installed. A few years later, the theatre closed with the entry of the United Kingdom into World War II. The Alexandra reopened in 1945 after the war ended and subsisted on a variety of live performances, such as boxing matches, Yiddish theatre productions, and special events. During this period, the theatre hosted performances from the Motley Theatre Design Group, including a 1947 staging of an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, adapted by Evgeny Schwartz. The Alexandra remained open and staging productions and events until finally closing its doors for good in 1950. Thereafter, the building stood empty for many years before being demolished in the early 1960s so that the Alexandra Court tenement could be built.

It was released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on 16 March 2018. The game has sold 2.56 million copies as of March 2019, making it one of the best-selling games on the Switch. It received mixed or average reviews. Praise went to the game's graphics, gameplay and soundtrack, but received criticism for its very easy difficulty level. Gameplay Kirby Star Allies is a 2.5D platform game played from a side-on perspective. Players control the series' titular protagonist Kirby who can be accompanied by up to three companions. Kirby can throw hearts at enemies to turn them into allies. The game can be played alone with the game's AI controlling companions or cooperatively with other players controlling companions. When Kirby has companions, new special attacks become available which allow Kirby to combine his abilities with those of his allies', a feature not seen since Kirby: Squeak Squad. The elemental fusions last for as long as the power is held or until a new element is introduced over it, while some of the combinations are single-use moves that bear more of a resemblance to the combinations found in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. Also, when Kirby has three allies, they can perform \\"Friend Actions\\" on specific stages, like \\"Friend Train\\" and \\"Friend Star.\\" To fight the final boss, Kirby can use a Friend Action called the \\"Star Allies Sparkler\\", which resembles to the Dragoon from Kirby Air Ride. With it, Kirby can traverse around the boss in full 3D - a rarity for the series - and shoot targets of interest. The game also introduces the \\"Dream Friend\\" system, which allows the player to call upon characters from past Kirby games as special allies with expanded movesets. Bandana Waddle Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight can all be unlocked as Dream Friends through progression in Story Mode. Additional Dream Friends have been added via software updates, including Rick, Kine and Coo (Dream Land 2); Marx (Super Star); Gooey (Dream Land 3); Adeleine & Ribbon (64); Dark Meta Knight (Amazing Mirror); Daroach (Squeak Squad); Magolor (Return to Dream Land); Taranza (Triple Deluxe); Susie (Planet Robobot); and the Three Mage- Sisters (Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne).  Plot  On the Jambandra space station far away from Kirby's home planet, a dark crystal heart explodes due to an imperfection in a mysterious ritual, sending its numerous fragments, Jamba Hearts, hurtling into deep space. Many characters, including King Dedede and Meta Knight, are possessed while investigating the hearts that land on Popstar. A heart hits Kirby, but it instead gives him the ability to befriend enemies by throwing hearts. Kirby notices many Waddle Dees bringing food to Castle Dedede and decides to investigate. After Kirby defeats Meta Knight and King Dedede and frees them from the Jamba Heart's influence, a large fortress known as Jambastion lands on Popstar. After defeating three generals of ice, fire, and electricity, Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne, respectively, Kirby and his friends fly to the far reaches of space. After defeating Francisca and Flamberge, along with other bosses, Kirby and his friends connect a path to Jambandra Base and breach its defensive barrier. They battle Zan once again before meeting Hyness, an evil cleric who is planning to restore a dark force, Void Termina, to full power using the Jamba Hearts. Defeating Hyness reveals his true face, a blue large-nosed figure with twitching eyes. He summons Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne and uses dark energy to strengthen them and drain their life force. After being defeated, Hyness sacrifices the three and himself to subsequently revive Void Termina. Kirby and his friends use a Friend Pedestal to summon the Friend Star but it transforms into the Star Allies Sparkler via the power of the four heart pins that were stuck in the prison of Void Termina. After overcoming its humanoid body, also regurgitating Hyness, Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne in the process, and defeating its bird form, it is revealed that its true form is a purplish pink cluster with three dark eye-like spots that can arrange themselves to resemble Kirby's face. During battle, this blob morphs into different shapes that reference Dark Matter from Kirby's Dream Land 2 and 02 from Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. Kirby then destroys Void Termina with the Star Allies Sparkler, summoning friends in the process. The Sparkler is destroyed by the resulting explosion, but Kirby uses a Warp Star to return himself and his friends safely home. Post Game Modes After defeating Hyness in the sub-game Guest Star ???? Star Allies Go!, Galacta Knight suddenly emerges from a portal to battle the player and their allies. However, before he starts the battle, a butterfly lands on his lance and absorbs him. It later transforms into a new masked swordsman called Morpho Knight, who wields a pair of butterfly-themed swords. The player and their friends defeat Morpho Knight, and he vanishes away. In the Soul Melter difficulty of The Ultimate Choice, Void Termina gets battled once again, though more powerful than before. After defeating the third form, its true form is revealed to be Void Soul, a blue version of the core with black spots. Kirby and his allies eventually defeat Void Soul. In Heroes in Another Dimension (takes place after the main story), Hyness and the Three Mage Sisters are corrupted and went to another dimension. So Kirby and his heroic Dream Friends have to travel four dimensions in order to unlock the final dimension and battle a corrupted form of Hyness and the other corrupted mages. If the player collects all 100 or more hearts, they can make Francisca, Flamberge and Zan Partizanne friends and send Kirby and his friends back to Dream Land. In the Soul Melter EX difficulty of The Ultimate Choice, Morpho Knight and Void Termina feature more difficult versions of their previous forms with darker color palettes. The fourth phase is of Void Termina is completely revamped to now feature Void, a white and red colored variant with rainbow cracks surrounding its body. The defeat animation is changed to instead have Void smile with stars being released as the screen turns white. Development and release Kirby Star Allies was developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo. The game is thought to be based upon the first incarnation of the cancelled Kirby game for the GameCube, the trailer for which shows Kirby making multiple helpers, akin to the fundamental element of Star Allies. The game was initially teased under the tentative title Kirby during E3 2017. In September 2017, the game's official title was announced during a Nintendo Direct presentation. The game was released for the Nintendo Switch game console on 16 March 2018. On 3 March 2018, a free demo of the game was released on the Nintendo eShop showcasing two of the game's stages. Reception Kirby Star Allies received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game's visuals, saying that they are \\"gorgeous\\", however they criticized the game's easy difficulty with Kyle Hilliard from Game Informer saying that \\"[Kirby Star Allies] demands so little from the player that I sometimes felt like I was barely involved at all\\". Critics praised the game's soundtrack. Hilliard called the game's soundtrack \\"fun and bubbly\\" and GameSpot reviewer Peter Brown and IGN reviewer Brendan Graeber calling the soundtrack \\"catchy\\". The game was nominated for \\"Family Game of the Year\\" at the D.I.C.E. Awards. At the release of the game's final post-launch content, some critics reevaluated the game, finding that the additional content resulted in an improved experience. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku commented that, while the main game was \\"a cakewalk\\", the additional Heroes in Another Dimension mode was \\"a head- scratcher and a reflex-tester\\", stating that Star Allies was \\"one of the most- improved Nintendo games on the Switch roster.\\" Another review, by Sean Anthony of Gaming Trend, also praised the creative level design and difficulty of Heroes in Another Dimension, and additionally complimented the added \\"Soul Melter EX\\" difficulty level; his conclusion was that \\"Kirby Star Allies is finally a complete game.\\"  Sales  Upon the game's launch, Kirby Star Allies became the fastest selling Kirby game in the United Kingdom. Kirby Star Allies sold 222,031 copies within its first week on sale in Japan, which placed it at number one on the all format sales chart. By the end of March, it had sold over a million copies. As of March 2019, Kirby Star Allies has sold 2.56 million copies.

He was convicted of the 1997 murder of 18-year-old Charles Dials (November 30, 1978 ‚Äì April 2, 1997) in Franklin County. Background Born in 1948, one of six siblings, he suffered an abusive home life. Between 1959-65, he was placed in ‚Äútwo different residential treatment facilities in Pennsylvania, nine separate detention center placements [and] two different foster homes.\\" His father was committed to the Lima State Hospital for raping one of Campbell's sisters. Campbell's mother was complicit in prostituting Campbell's sisters in exchange for money and alcohol when the girls were teenagers, and one of Campbell's sisters became pregnant at age 15, Stebbins described. Campbell and his sisters were finally removed from their mother's care after the children entered a bar and begged for food. Campbell's earliest recorded offenses, according to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, were three counts of armed robbery, one of grand larceny, and one of shooting with the intent to kill. All of the charges originated in three different counties. He was sentenced to an unspecified amount of prison time in June 1968, aged 20. He was convicted of the murder of an adult male in the course of a robbery in November 1972. He was regarded by Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien as \\"the poster child for the death penalty.\\" Murder of Charles Dials On April 2, 1997, Campbell, feigning paralysis and thus in a wheelchair, was transported to court on an aggravated robbery charge. Upon arrival, he overpowered the sheriff's deputy responsible for transporting him, stole her gun, and fled the courthouse loading dock. Campbell then carjacked 18-year-old Charles Dials, forcing him to drive for three hours. During that time, several mentions of the pursuit of Campbell by police were made over the radio, prompting Dials to ask Campbell if the person being pursued was him. After three hours, Campbell demanded that Dials get on the floor of his truck. Dials refused, prompting Campbell to shoot him twice, killing him. Campbell fled the vehicle before being caught by police shortly after. Legal proceedings and aborted execution Campbell was convicted of the aggravated robbery charge for which he was initially in court on October 7, 1997, six months after the death of Dials. He was convicted of Dials' murder and sentenced to death on April 10, 1998, just over a year after the killing. In an order published by Ohio Governor John Kasich on May 1, 2017, Campbell's execution was rescheduled from September 13, 2017, to November 15, 2017, at the prescribed execution time of 10am EST. His clemency hearing was scheduled for October 12, 2017. The parole board returned a unanimous vote against clemency on October 20, 2017. After being sent to the execution room on the morning of November 15, 2017, Campbell's execution was called off due to the nature of his health problems preventing the lethal injection from occurring. Executioners were unable to successfully find a vein in which to insert the IV which would contain the lethal drugs. His execution was rescheduled for June 5, 2019. Death On March 3, 2018, Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien announced that Campbell had died of natural causes.Franklin County prosecutor: Death row inmate Alva Campbell has died, 10tv.com; accessed March 3, 2018.

The company's R&D; unit, employing 100 people as of 2016, is co-located with the headquarters in Copenhagen. Rockwool was the world's largest maker of insulation materials in 2009, but had fallen to the second largest by 2016. , 90% of the company's revenue came from the sale of insulation products, while 80% came from sales in Europe. History Rockwool was founded as Kors√∏r Stenforretning by constructor Henrik Johan Henriksen and brickyard-owner Valdemar K√§hler in 1909 as a gravel mining company. In 1922, the company won the contract on improving the dykes at Saltb√¶k Vig and later purchased the area. In 1927, it purchased a chipping plant at Hedehusene. In 1937,Citation Hanna 2010 states that production started in 1935. a production of mineral wool (stone wool) was established at the site based on an American license acquired by Finn Henriksen during a visit to the States. By 1939, the focus of the company had fully turned toward the manufacture of insulation. In 1972, the company was divided into H+H and I/S K√§hler & Co. K√§hler & Co. was led by Valdemar K√§hler's grand son Claus K√§hler. He was succeeded on the post by his son Tom K√§hler in 1986. In 2004, Tom became chairman of the board while Eelco van Heel took over the position as chief executive officer. The company began trading as \\"Rockwool International A/S\\" on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in 1995. Before it became a public company, it was a family-owned business, held by the K√§hler family. The company's first plant in the United States opened in 2014 in Marshall County, Mississippi. In 2017, the company announced a North American expansion through establishment of a plant in Ranson, West Virginia through its subsidiary Roxul. Brands Rockfon Rockfon is a brand of acoustic ceiling and wall solutions based on rockwool. = Flumroc = In 1969, Rockwool acquired a minority stake related to technology licensing in the privately held Swiss company Flumroc AG. In November 2017 Rockwool completed acquisition of all outstanding shares of Flumroc; company sales have been largely limited to Switzerland. Due to the broad recognition of the brand in Switzerland, Rockwool kept using the Flumroc brand.  Roxul  With the acquisition of a stone wool factory in Ontario, Canada, Roxul Inc. was established as the Canadian subsidiary. When business started in the United States, Roxul USA Inc. was established as the US subsidiary. On 1 January 2018, the North American insulation business rebranded to ROCKWOOL North America.  Management From 1987-2004, Rockwool Group's President and CEO was Tom K√§hler. From 2004-2014, Eelco van Heel held those positions. As of 2015, Rockwool Group's President and CEO was Jens Birgersson.

In 2015, Rockwool International filed suit against Rock Wool Manufacturing Company hoping to quash potential consumer confusion in the face of the defendant having filed a trademark application for \\"Rock Wool\\"; the suit was dismissed by the court after Rock Wool's abandonment of their trademark application.  Rockwool Foundation  In 1981, six members of the K√§hler family established the Rockwool Foundation with an endowment of 25% of each of their own stock holdings in Rockwool International. The Foundation has been referred to as a think tank by some authors. The Rockwool Foundation Research Unit was established as a fully independent unit with a focus on social science research in 1987 by the Foundation, led since 2003 by Torbin Tran√¶s. The Research Unit has been described as self-financed and non-partisan. The Research Unit has published on topics such as the extent of the financial black market in Denmark. In other published cases, it has been unclear whether the Research Unit or the Foundation have been the actor, as in the case of examining the British health care system with an eye toward the financial cost of emulating the Kaiser Permanente system, and an analysis of the impact on the Danish economy of wages lost through prisoner incarceration.

Design & history The origins of the 8 cm kanon vz. 28 began in 1928 at the ≈†koda Works in Pilsen. The design attempted to combine the field gun, mountain gun, and anti-aircraft gun roles into one weapon. The vz. 28 combined a two-wheeled box trail carriage, horizontal sliding wedge breech, hydro-pneumatic recoil system, muzzle break, high angle elevation and a firing table for 360¬∞ degree traverse. For the mountain gun role it could be broken down into three pieces for transport, a feature also shared by the contemporary 10 cm houfnice vz. 28 and the later 8 cm kanon vz. 30 and 10 cm houfnice vz. 30 guns. The vz. 28 proved to be fairly successful as a field and mountain gun, but was a failure as an anti-aircraft gun. The Czech Army used the vz. 28 in limited numbers, but ordered its successor the vz. 30 in larger numbers. The vz. 30 lacked the vz. 28's firing table, otherwise their configuration, dimensions, and performance were largely the same. The Yugoslav Army ordered the vz. 28 who referred to it as the 80 mm M.28. The Romanian Army also ordered a 75 mm version the 75 mm Skoda Model 1928 which it used during World War II. Guns captured from Yugoslavia by the Germans were given the designation 7.65 cm FK 304(j). Notes References * Peter Chamberlain and Terry Gander: Light and Medium field Artillery. New York.

It was owned by the Vancouver, Victoria, and Eastern Railway and Navigation Company, a subsidiary of the Great Northern Railway, and was managed by James J. Hill. Origin The Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway was a promotion railway in southwestern British Columbia proposed and later built to oppose and take business from the Canadian Pacific Railway. While the V.V. & E. was first, the CPR later built the Kettle Valley Railway as a separate southern line crossing the province. The V.V. & E. was chartered by Vancouver businessmen including the mayor, to funnel the rich Kootenay mining trade and wealth through to Vancouver. It was chartered in 1896 and built from 1905 to 1916. Its route ran from Cloverdale in Surrey, through Langley, Abbotsford, Sumas Prairie, to Hope, with another section in the Coquihalla Pass area going from Brookmere to Otter Lake, Tulameen, Coalmont, Princeton, Hedley, Keremeos, and thence crossing into the United States at Nighthawk, Washington, and striking onto Oroville. It crossed the international border five times in its meandering journey and terminated back again in Canada at Grand Forks. This railway was to have a very long, slow birth. It was politically, legally, and structurally protracted. When the Canadian Pacific Railway was finished in 1886, it had the monopoly on railways in the area for some twenty years. This and the high freight rates alienated citizens in the west. Also, the discovery of rich silver ore at Nelson heralded a mining boom in southeastern BC. Railways and shipping lines were built into the area, with many coming from the Spokane area of Washington State. This was the backdrop of an ongoing feud between two railroad barons. William van Horne, an American who was President of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and James Jerome Hill, a Canadian who had been a director of the CPR but left after an argument with the board and became a railroad baron on his own in Minnesota. He would build the rival Great Northern Railway, which paralleled the CPR line on the south side of the border in the US. The two companies and presidents would fight a legendary war for rail lines, trade and political favour. The CPR would fight battles with the GN at Sandon, Midway, Nelson, Grand Forks, and Greenwood, and finally Sapperton. They would have rate wars, overbuild rail lines, and put competing interests into the mining areas. The CPR would buy up coal mines, used for fuel to smelt ore, and it even accidentally bought a smelter when it obtained Heinze's Columbia and Western line. This became the famed Cominco smelter at Trail. To this end, GN was also buying, building, and proposing other lines to abut and enter onto CPR territory. GN bought the Victoria and Sidney Railway on Vancouver Island. It built the New Westminster and Southern Railway to connect Bellingham with New Westminster. It started the Victoria Terminal Railway and Ferry Company in 1903, which ran from Ladner to Cloverdale, and thus it was engaged in constructing a network of rails and ferries to compete. The CPR had a monopoly, better geography with respect to the economy of Canada, and the deep pockets of starry-eyed London bankers. With much of the mineral traffic going to the US, Vancouver felt like an unwanted dance partner and thought a Coast- to-Kootenay railway would improve things. The CPR had penetrated the mineral area with a hybrid rail system of trains and lake boats to get to the region. This did not reduce the threat from the American rivals as they had easier geography to access the Kootenays. And so, a railway was proposed by Vancouver and Victoria businessman to be a non-CPR line, one that was Canadian-owned, to the Kootenay district. Mayor Templeman was a principal proponent. From this came the name of Vancouver, Victoria & Eastern. At the same time, the CPR and the GN were vying to expand their lines to southeastern BC. The CPR negotiated with Ottawa to exchange a lower freight rate, mainly for grain farmers, the Crow Rate, in exchange for subsidies to build a railway from the Crowsnest Pass in Alberta to Nelson and the booming mining town of Rossland. This eastern line did not placate the businessmen of Vancouver. Another independent narrow gauge line, the Columbia and Western Railway, was built by Montana copper king Fritz Heinze. It was soon bought by the CPR and would eventually grow into the eastern segment of the Kettle Valley Railway. Amidst all this bustle was the V.V. & E. line, which everyone thought was a good idea, but actual advancement never seemed to happen. It was sold to the Manitoba railway kings of McKenzie and Mann, but they lost interest when they failed to get a federal subsidy (as it was given to the CPR.) As a result, the line was resold to James Jerome Hill and the GN in 1901. However, the line was not Hill's trump card. He was busy with another line ‚Äî the Victoria, Westminster & Yukon Railway. It was a local line promoted by lumber baron John Hendry, who wanted to get into the railway business and break the CPR monopoly in the Vancouver area. He built a line with GN help from New Westminster to the False Creek flats in Vancouver. This is the present main line through Burnaby still used by GN, CN, and Amtrak today. Hendry thought he might extend the line to the other booming mining district in the far off Yukon. For this he would have to arrange to have a bridge built across Burrard Inlet to North Vancouver and then eventually build north. Hendry served as president for a time for the V.V. & E. In this mix came the manoeuvering and rivalry between the various factions: the CPR, GN, the Canadian Federal and Provincial governments, and several administrations of different political stripes. Hill and Hendry had a protracted and convoluted business contract which built the line into Vancouver but delayed the V.V. and E. for fifteen years. In this time period, GN re-aligned its north‚Äìsouth railway from the swamps of Surrey to Delta as it built along the foreshore at White Rock, virtually creating the beachside community, across Mud Bay, Burns Bog, and over the new federally-built railway bridge at New Westminster. One aspect furthering the delay in construction of the Hope to Okanagan Section was the steep and solid coast mountains east of Hope. The granite peaks rose up suddenly and presented no easy path through. In this region, railway construction would be perilously expensive. Both the V.V. & E. and CPR did surveys through the Coquihalla Pass area ‚Äî V.V. & E. in 1896 and CPR in 1900. Over time, the V.V. & E. became a political cause. The citizens loved any idea that broke the CPR monopoly, and armchair railway barons liked pencilling in lines across maps. Furthering this was the fact that getting to the Kootenays from the coast was a two-day affair by the circuitous existing lines. Competing governments would raise the issue, as would newspaper editors. The Dunsmuir government in BC became embroiled in the V.V. & E. as it paid for a survey of the mountains in the Hope area. The aged Edgar Dewdney, of Dewdney Trail fame, was brought out of retirement and performed the work. Subsequently, the Dunsmuir government fell due to bribery and corruption charges over the railway. One officer, Edward Prior, was also booted from office due to a similar public works scandal. And thus, the Coast- to-Kootenay railway became just a dream. In the meantime, further mineral discoveries were made in the copper-rich Boundary districts and thus the CPR and the GN extended their lines westward from the Nelson area. Construction The demise of the Dunsmuir government in BC brought in premier Richard McBride, and with him came a railway-building era the likes of which the province had never seen. The V. V & E came north from Marcus, Washington, into Grand Forks. Lines then extended the copper camps of Phoenix, BC, and Republic, WA., with a line coming to Midway and Bridesville and then returning to Washington State at Molson. As such, the V.V. & E. also started in 1907 at Cloverdale and ran east through Langley and the flat hills and meandering brooks of the Fraser Valley. It wandered into Abbotsford, where it crossed over the CPR lines at Huntingdon and onto the flat Sumas Prairie. In 1910, the V.V. & E. skirted around the then large Sumas Lake, into the brick plant at Kilgard, and along the eastern foot of Sumas Mountain. At the same time, Hill was building a line westward from the American Okanagan at Oroville to Hedley and Princeton. Large coal deposits of high grade coal, suitable for burning in hard-pulling steam locomotives, was discovered near Coalmont. Slowly, the two GN lines were coming together. McKenzie and Mann, the former owners of the line, were building a competing transcontinental line through the Fraser Canyon and Valley, the Canadian Northern Pacific, and thus traded access to the GN: the V.V. & E. could use its line from Cannor (named from CANadian NORthern) at Chilliwack Mountain to run 25 miles east along the narrowing valley to Hope, while the Canadian Northern would use the GN's line from New Westminster to False Creek in Vancouver. Finding enough space for the railway terminus and yards for the two rail lines became a headache for the City of Vancouver. The problem was solved by using the spoil from the Grandview Cut and filling in the eastern side of False Creek. The V. W. & Y crossed the creek on wooden piles and ended at a small building beside the Ho Ho Restaurant. The V.V. & E. bought the V.W. & Y. in 1908. The Canadian Northern Railway and the V.V. & E. also had contracts on Vancouver Island, with the former building to Bamfield and the latter to the Alberni Valley respectively. By 1910, both the CPR and the GN were committed to building Coast-to-Kootenay Railways. GN had the advantage in the east as it had completed the line to Princeton from Grand Forks, although much of it in American territory; the CPR had the advantage in the west, as it had built to Hope and had a line to the coal mines of Merritt. Filling in the gaps from Grand Forks to Hope presented a few problems. There were mountains, narrow canyons, high plateaux, and steep grades. There was also a ponderously slow and politically susceptible Board of Railway Construction and its government masters in Ottawa. Naturally, the CPR maintained the upper hand and received subsidies and favouritism from Ottawa. The CPR's line was a separate line and legal entity called the Kettle Valley Railway. It was to be the great rival to the V.V. & E. It was the canyons and crests of the Coquihalla country that came to the fore. During this time, neither line had publicly declared its preferred route. Although with the GN at Princeton and driving on to Coalmont, and the CPR already at Hope and Merritt, the convergence of forces were destined to meet at Coquihalla Pass. Dewdney's survey had investigated the terrain and reported that the ground was not suitable for easy railway construction and any line would be costly. The routes were determined by the mountains and there were only three choices of passes in the area ‚Äî Coquihalla Pass, with its canyon of scree on the approach from the south; Allison Pass, with its narrow canyons and bluffs; and Railroad Pass, with high peaks and steep grades. [Not to be confused with the Railroad Pass in the Pemberton Area.] In 1909, J. Hill ordered the construction of an eight-mile tunnel using the Railroad Pass Route to Tulameen. Contracts were let and work started. Hill had no fear of long tunnels as he had built the Cascade Tunnel across the Cascade Mountains near Everett, Washington, to complete his US mainline. He then reconsidered and chose to use the canyon and Coquihalla Pass alignment. Some argue that Hill reasoned the long tunnel would take too long to complete, that he had disputes with his own board, that the project was too expensive, or that he could build through Coquihalla Pass just to stymie the CPR. However, both railways had surveys going through the canyon and it became apparent that there was only room for one line in the mountains. The GN complained to the Board of Railway Construction that the CPR was encroaching on its survey, which GN had filed with the board first. There was a legal battle as to who had first rights to the canyon. Hill was not averse to disputes over right of way and had fought with other lines, as at the Deschutes River War. The Railway Board sent its own engineers to examine the canyon. Both railways continued construction on their lines between 1911‚Äì13. In the provincial election of 1912, McBride campaigned on subsidising the CPR with a $10,000 per mile grant and a $200,000 completion bonus. McBride won his fourth election. No money was offered to the V.V. & E. In 1913, the Railway Board and the two railways signed the Coquihalla Pass Agreement, whereby the two lines agreed to share tracks through the Coquihalla area--the CPR would build from Hope through the pass to Brookmere, and GN would allow Kettle Valley trains to use its track from Brookmere to Princeton. The granite mountains have forced the warring railways to compromise. GN paid the CPR $150,000 per year to run its train over CPR tracks. Demise Almost as soon as the V.V. & E. was finished, GN began to lose interest in the line. It cut back service, which offended passengers and shippers. With less traffic, the railway cut service even more. It was in a death spiral. Normal business was interrupted by the First World War. Then came the post-war slump and increasing competition from the Panama Canal. In the Fraser Valley, GN faced fierce competition from the BC Electric railway, which could run shorter, cheaper trains more often, and thus was popular with the dairy farmers and market gardeners. Because of this, GN began to abandon the V.V. & E. line in the Upper Valley from 1920. Nine years later, the entire western end of the V.V. & E. was abandoned. Its birthing process had lasted longer than its operating lifetime. The mountain section lasted longer, hauling gold ore from Hedley and ice from Otter Lake to the cities in pre-refrigeration days. GN was quick to cut back its feeder lines as the mines played out. The Kettle Valley Railway became the top competitor. GN stopped running trains on the Brookmere to Princeton section in 1937 and coal mining stopped in Coalmont in 1940 due to a massive underground explosion. GN sold its last coast section of the V.V. & E. to the CPR in 1945; it needed it to run trains from Brookmere to Penticton. The CPR rebuilt the wooden bridges on the Similkameen River with heavy steel ones in 1948. GN ran trains to Keromeos until 1972, when that section was abandoned. References Bibliography *F.

He introduced varietal fruits to the Pacific coast, first to Oregon and later to California, and gave the Fruitvale district its name. In his later years, he led a Utopian community from California to Honduras, only to encounter overwhelming adversity, which sent him back to California.  Early life: horticulture and abolitionism  Luelling was born on April 23, 1809 in Randolph County, North Carolina, where he lived until at least 1822. Luelling and his brother John went into the nursery business together in Henry County, Indiana in 1835. Soon after, Henderson became interested in Oregon, upon reading the journals of Lewis and Clark. Henderson moved to Salem, Iowa in 1837, purchasing land for a nursery jointly with John. John disposed of the Indiana property and joined Henderson in 1841. They also established a dry goods store. In the early 1840s, Luelling and his wife, Jane Elizabeth Presnall Luelling, built a two-story residence with features for hiding former slaves on the Underground Railroad. They were ousted from the Salem Monthly Meeting of Friends, for their abolitionist activities.  The first orchards on the west coast  Luelling and his family (including eight children) departed for Oregon in 1847. They brought a wagonload of 700 fruit trees, half of which survived the journey. He coordinated with William Meek, a fellow Iowa nurseryman. They selected a variety of fruits that would ripen from summer through winter. Meek also brought trees to Oregon, where the two reconvened and established a nursery where Milwaukie would soon be established. Luelling's brother Seth also joined them the following year, and though he also established himself in the fruit tree business, he did not partner with them. It is likely that Seth bought the nursery in about 1859. Luelling sold trees for 1 to 1.50 each. Ultimately, the nursery supplied orchards for the settlers who came to Oregon following the passage of the Donation Land Claim Act in 1850. The Luelling brothers' horticultural accomplishments have been described as the source of much of Milwaukie's early fame. The site of their first nursery in Milwaukie is now the Waverly Country Club. Henderson left for the San Francisco Bay Area in 1854, with his son Alfred and son-in-law William Meek. Seth, and later Alfred, continued the Milwaukie nursery for many years, and it became a hub for populist and progressive political organization decades later. Henderson bought 50 acres at the southern end of Alameda County, but after a title dispute, bought 400 acres on Sausal Creek in what is now Oakland. The orchard he established was called Fruit Vale, the namesake of the present neighborhood of Fruitvale. The contributions of Luelling and Meek were acknowledged in Frances Fuller Victor's History of Oregon, vol. 1.  Utopian ambitions  Luelling outlived each of his first three wives. His fourth, he abandoned in California when he sold his orchard and business and left for Honduras in 1858, hoping to establish a utopian community called the Harmonial Brotherhood. The venture was a failure, and he returned to California two years later. He died in 1878, and was buried in Mountain View Cemetery.  Surname  In many records his family name is spelled Lewelling, and his brother Seth used that spelling. According to Henderson's son Alfred, the spelling had been changed from the original Welsh spelling by Henderson and Seth's father, prior to Henderson's birth; but Seth reverted to the original spelling later in life. Similarly, some records list his birth year as 1809 or 1810, and his death year as 1878 or 1879. Television depiction The actor Royal Dano was cast as Luelling in the 1965 episode, \\"The Traveling Trees,\\" on the syndicated television series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Ronald Reagan. In the story line, Luelling, against the advice of his wagon master, takes the Hastings Cutoff to Oregon, where he intends to plant an apple orchard. Tim McIntire appeared as a young reformed outlaw, Ben Fraser, with Robert Yuro as Ben's older brother, Spencer Fraser.

Background The Club was officially instituted on 2 August 1777 in Hamilton as 'the Hunters Club'. The following year the club took the name 'The Caledonian Hunt Club'. The Duke of Hamilton was to be the President of the Club and the Countess Eglinton was to be the Patron. As the name implied the club was originally constituted to hunt, with the first fortnight long meeting set to take place at Haddington on 12 October 1778. However, it seemed that the club was also concerned from the beginning with horse racing. One year after it was instituted the club held races at Musselburgh. Two years after it was instituted the Caledonian Hunt club sponsored its first race at the Racecourse in Kelso. So it was, that the club met twice a year at Kelso, using the Cross Keys Hotel as their meeting point. Over time the frequency of their meets increased, in both Edinburgh and elsewhere. A Hunt Ball was held, a notable example of which was the ball of 1787, for which the Edinburgh Assembly Rooms were opened for the first time. In 1786 a Yorkshire Colonel visited the club and remarked: Although the club became based in Edinburgh, the location of its race meetings varied each year, with Kelso playing host most often. Although the club had a choice of 8 different courses in Scotland, they only chose Aberdeen once. Robbie Burns Around 1787 Robbie Burns met with members of the Caledonia Hunt Club, having befriended a number of members around Edinburgh. Burns dedicated the first Edinburgh Edition of his Poems to the Hunt. To return the favour the treasurer of the Caledonia Hunt Club was instructed to \\"subscribe for one hundred copies in their name, for which he should pay Mr Burns ¬£25, upon the publication of his book.\\" By 1792 Burns was himself a member of the Caledonia Hunt Club. A portrait of Robbie Burns was given to the club by the famous engraver William Walker. The print is now property of the British museum. Royal Patronage In 1822 as part of his visit to Edinburgh King George IV attended the Caledonian Hunt Club's annual ball. He was so struck with the meeting that he agreed to be the patron of the club, permitting them to use the title 'Royal'. Nathaniel Gow provided the music for the event, but refused to charge the club, having been so pleased by the response of the King to his music. Since the patronage of 1822, several other monarchs and royals have been involved with the club, including William IV, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and Edward VII. Inspired Art In addition to Robbie Burns, the Royal Caledonia Hunt Club seems to have inspired the works of other artists. For example, The Caledonian Hunt, by Sir Alexander Don in 1780 and the Royal Caledonian Hunt's Delight, written by Mr James Miller in 1792 (later given words by Robbie Burns); and North's (Milles Macphail) Farewell to the Caledonian Hunt published as part of the Gow collection.

The company is Australia's largest pharmacy retailer with over 350 stores, and employs over 8,000 staff. The company brands itself as offering discounted prices for pharmaceutical goods. Model The company has been dubbed \\"the McDonald's of pharmacy\\" and uses a complex franchise structure to circumvent Australian regulations that limit how many pharmacies a company can operate in any one area. The company's structure allows it to \\"control\\" about 400 pharmacies across Australia, and it makes up about 50 percent of the market share. The business model used by Chemist Warehouse is thought to involve minimal equity investment by individual pharmacists who agree to the trading terms enforced across the group. Individual pharmacists working under the Chemist Warehouse umbrella benefit from the bulk purchasing power that comes with being part of the company. The company had an estimated revenue of $2.3 billion in 2013‚Äì14. The 2013 Inside Retail Magazine Top 50 Most Powerful Retailers list placed Sam Gance of Chemist Warehouse at number 16. Radio The company has ventured into radio, creating the Chemist Warehouse Remix with Australian Radio Network. The radio was publicised as a 'custom built station' for Chemist Warehouse. It is not limited to stores and can be heard via the web, or with a smartphone app. Critics The Pharmacy Guild and pharmacists' union have criticised the company, stating its approach threatens both healthcare standards and employment conditions in the industry.

It was founded by Robbie van Dam and Craig Bond in 2005, and sells pest control equipment and accessories. The company's focus is on humanely controlling rodent populations, for which it has received some recognition in New Zealand and internationally. History Goodnature was founded by Robbie van Dam and Craig Bond who met while studying industrial design at Victoria University. Van Dam was working at the Department of Conservation (DOC) in the Biodiversity Unit building pest control traps, where he felt that the methods of killing pests such as rats, stoats and possums were either inefficient or inhumane. DOC funded the development of some of their early concepts, which eventually evolved into their modern products. Department of Conservation partnership DOC funded the development of some of Goodnature's early concepts, which eventually evolved into the company's current product line. In cooperation with the DOC, Goodnature released a beta of a self-resetting trap for rats and stoats during New Zealand Conservation Week in September 2009. The first model of the trap could self-reset 12 times using compressed CO2. After some testing, a later model was specifically designed for brushtail possums, and another for rats and stoats. The company also began developing non-toxic animal attractants to use as lures. The DOC currently uses Goodnature's traps, and recommends their use in both New Zealand's public and private sectors. Products Goodnature A24 trap powered by a CO2 canister Goodnature produces and sells two pest control devices; the A12 (capable of killing up to 12 possums per CO2 to canister) for brushtail possums, and the A24 (capable of killing up to 24 rats or mustelids per CO2 canister) for rats and stoats. The company also manufactures animal lures which act as attractants for targeted species. The traps are powered by compressed gas and use a target-specific lure to attract animals. When triggered, the traps strike the skull or spine of the animal with a steel- cored, glass reinforced, polymer piston (described as a captive bolt), killing the animal almost instantly. After action, the animal drops to the ground and the piston returns to its original position, primed for another use. This design makes them well suited to conservation projects in remote areas, where manually resetting traps may present logistical challenges. Evaluation and Recognition Goodnature's traps were evaluated by the New Zealand DOC from 2010‚Äì2016. Subsequently, the DOC‚Äôs Science and Technical team recommended their use for conservation projects to protect New Zealand native plant and bird species. The traps are also endorsed by New Zealand's Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) for their effectiveness. After evaluating the traps according to its guidelines, the MPI's Animal Welfare Advisory Committee gave the traps a Class A standard for humaneness. The A12 is currently the only possum trap given this rating. The A24 was found to be compliant with the United Kingdom‚Äôs Spring Traps Approval Order of 2018. In 2019, the USDA's National WIldlife Research Center published an evaluation of the A24's efficacy against house mice, citing them as a \\"non-toxicant alternative rodenticide\\". The study found that mice who triggered the trap died instantly, considerably faster than the internationally accepted definition of a humane death. The traps were found to have a 100% efficacy rate, meaning that all mice who triggered the traps were killed instantly, with no partial injuries. Awards In 2016, the A24 rat and stoat trap won Best Effect at the Design Institute of New Zealand for supporting the DOC‚Äôs work in New Zealand forests. Together with the DOC, Goodnature also received the supreme Purple Pin at the New Zealand's \\"Best Design\\" awards. Both the A24 and A12 have won the Non-Consumer, Sustainable Product Design and Best Effect awards at the New Zealand design institute‚Äôs Best Awards. Usage Conservation Goodnature's traps have been used in New Zealand in a number of DOC projects, city and regional councils, community groups, and households. The DOC has used Goodnature traps on Native Island, Southland, at Harts Hill in Fiordland National Park, at Boundary Stream, Hawkes Bay, Te Urewera Mainland Island, and at Abel Tasman National Park In June 2017, 1200 stoat traps were installed on 11,400 hectares of the Haast Kiwi Sanctuary to protect tokoeka kiwi, as part of the department's Battle For Our Birds programme. In the same programme, DOC also increased the number of stoat traps in Arthur's Pass National Park and Lake Sumner Forest Park in an effort to save one of New Zealand‚Äôs rarest parakeets (orange-fronted parakeet) from extinction. In January 2017, the kiwi sanctuary at Rimutaka Forest Park was doubled in size to 7000 hectares to aid the regeneration of New Zealand‚Äôs North Island brown kiwi. A total of 1200 Goodnature traps were laid down to reduce the number of stoats at the park which prey on kiwi. The traps were also used in the rodent control program at Maria Langa Cay, Puerto Rico in 2014, in order to avoid the use of rodenticide on the island, which is a nesting site for the endangered hawksbill sea turtle and home to the brown pelican. Goodnature traps are also used in conservation projects throughout Hawaii including in Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Oahu, in the Waianae and Ko'olau mountain ranges of Oahu, and on the island of Lanai. The company has also developed targeted devices for introduced mongoose in Hawaii, the introduced American mink in Finland and Sweden, and the introduced grey squirrel in the United Kingdom.

It quickly became the primary opposition organization in the state against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. After witnessing the opposition in a United States Department of State hearing in York, Nebraska Kleeb began organizing locals. She garnered the support of local landowner Randy Thompson and Omaha lawyer David Domina. Kleeb and Thompson held meetings with landowners and locals who would be affected by the pipeline, either farms in the direct path or ranches that depend on the Ogallala Aquifer. In 2011 Thompson was used as the face of the movement with the slogan, \\"Stand With Randy.\\" The campaign eventually led to the University of Nebraska cutting advertising ties with TransCanada. By the end of 2011 the pipeline had become a national issue. In 2016 the organization fell under the newly-formed Bold Alliance of which Kleeb is the founder and president.

Rambo won the IRA's all-around cowboy season championship four times between 1946 and 1950. He took part in numerous disciplines, including saddle bronc riding, steer roping, steer wrestling, and tie-down roping. Rambo was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1989. Biography Rambo was born in San Miguel, California, on June 12, 1920. His father was a ranch foreman in Monterey County. By the age of seven, Rambo was helping to train horses. At the age of 17, he participated in a rodeo for the first time in 1937; he took part in bull riding in that event. At the 1938 Frontier Days rodeo in Prescott, Arizona, Rambo won \\"His first big rodeo money\\", according to The Oklahoman's Willard H. Porter. Rambo went on to participate in International Rodeo Association (IRA) events. In 1944, he was the all-around champion at the Pendleton Round-Up and received the Sam Jackson Trophy for his effort. At a 1945 event in Madison Square Garden in New York City, Rambo suffered a broken bone in his shoulder and was forced to withdraw. In 1946, he won the all- around IRA season championship. Rambo was the season earnings leader in each of the five disciplines that comprised the IRA all-around standings, becoming the first cowboy to accomplish the feat. In addition, he was the first \\"to win an all-around world championship and the all-around championship of a major show all in 10 days' competition, plus three individual event championships for the show.\\" Two years later, he claimed his second IRA all-around title. Rambo was the all-around champion, and the leading earner in saddle bronc riding and bareback bronc riding, in that year's Newhall-Saugus Rodeo, and he was the leader in two disciplines at Cheyenne Frontier Days. In 1949, he repeated as the all-around champion, becoming the first cowboy with three all- around season titles. At one San Francisco rodeo, he won around $4,000 in prize money; for the season, he earned 10,723 standings points and approximately $25,000 in earnings. That year, he also won the all-around competition at the Ellensburg Rodeo, and finished third in the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA) all-around cowboy season standings, behind Jim Shoulders and Bill Linderman. In 1950, Rambo won the steer wrestling competition at the Newhall-Saugus Rodeo, and was the calf roping champion at the Fort Worth Stock Show (where he earned $2,500). At the end of that year's IRA season, Rambo was crowned the organization's all-around champion for the fourth time. After that season, he announced that he would not participate in most bull riding disciplines in the future, although he remained active in other events. In 1955, Rambo partnered with Everett Muzio to win the team roping competition at the Reno Rodeo, a feat he repeated in 1958 with Jim Rodriguez. Rambo was the 1957 all-around winner at the California Rodeo Salinas; it was his third championship at the rodeo, having won titles in 1948 and 1949. In two of the next three years (1958 and 1960), he and Rodriguez tied for the California Rodeo Salinas all-around championship. With Rodriguez, Rambo won the team roping average earnings championship at the National Finals Rodeo in 1959 and 1960. The pair also won team roping titles at the California Rodeo Salinas four times in a six-year span between 1957 and 1962. Rambo was a member of the RCA's board of directors from 1962 to 1965. At and during his peak years in rodeo, Rambo was noted for his versatility. He participated in bareback and saddle bronc riding, tie-down roping, steer roping, and steer wrestling. In addition, he took part in team roping events. Porter said of Rambo that \\"He was hard as a rock, yet he had the suppleness and flexibility of much smaller riders. On February 21, 1988, Rambo was killed when he accidentally shot himself while climbing a fence. He was 67 years old. In 1955, he was inducted into the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum's Rodeo Hall of Fame. The Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame in Pendleton, Oregon inducted Rambo in 1969, the St. Paul Rodeo Hall of Fame inducted him in 1998, the ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted him in 1989, and the California Rodeo Salinas Hall of Fame inducted him in 2010.

After arriving in Buenos Aires, he formed the shipping company Matti y C√≠a, whose ships made trips from Buenos Aires to Rosario, Santa Fe. Later he was associated with Natalio Rold√°n, founding the Compa√±√≠a de Navegaci√≥n a Vapor del R√≠o Bermejo, dedicated to navigate the Bermejo River.

In 1873, Guillermo Matti traveled to London, where formed an anonymous association of British capitals, named The Buenos Aires Campana Railway Company Limited.

In addition to winning several national league titles and domestic cups since their formation around the start of the 20th century, the club is perhaps best known for their policy of only signing players who have some link to their home territory, and for being one of only three clubs to have participated in every league season without being relegated, despite the restrictions of the policy.  Bilbao FC, Athletic Club and Club Bizcaya  Copa del Rey in 1903. Football was introduced to Bilbao by two distinct groups of players, both with British connections; British steel and shipyard workers and Basque students returning from schools in Britain. In the late 19th century, Bilbao was a leading port of an important industrial area with iron mines and shipyards nearby. It was the driving force of the Spanish economy and as a result attracted many migrant workers. Among them were miners from the north-east of England, and shipyard workers from Southampton, Portsmouth and Sunderland. The British workers brought with them (as to so many other parts of the world) the game of football. In the early 1890s, these workers came together and formed Bilbao Football Club. Meanwhile, sons of the Basque educated classes had made the opposite journey and went to Britain to complete their studies in civil engineering and commerce. While in the United Kingdom, these students developed an interest in football and on their return to Bilbao they began to arrange games with British workers. In 1898, students belonging to the Gymnasium Zamacois founded the Athletic Club, using the English spelling. In 1901, a meeting was held in the Caf√© Garc√≠a, which established more formal rules and regulations. In 1902, the two Bilbao clubs formed a combined team, known as Bizcaya, in the first Copa del Rey. They returned with the trophy after defeating Barcelona in the final. This would lead to the eventual merger of the two clubs as Athletic Club in 1903. In the same year, Basque students also formed Athletic Club Madrid; this club later evolved into Atl√©tico Madrid. The club's foundation date is a subject of debate among football historians. The club itself declares 1898, but others claim 1901 or 1903 as the true founding year.  Copa del Rey  Athletic Club crest of 1913. The club featured prominently in early Copa del Rey competitions. Following the inaugural win by Club Bizcaya, the newly formed Athletic Bilbao won it again in 1903. In 1904, they were declared winners after their opponents, Club Espa√±ol de Madrid, failed to turn up. In 1907, they revived the name Club Vizcaya after entering a combined team with Union Vizcaino. After a brief lull, they won the competition again in 1911 and then won it three times in a row between 1914 and 1916. The star of this team was Pichichi, a prolific goalscorer who scored the very first goal in the San Mam√©s stadium on 21 August 1913 and a hat-trick in the 1915 final, before dying aged just 29 in 1922. Today, the La Liga top-scorer is declared the Pichichi in his honour.  The first La Liga  Athletic were not the only Basque team represented in the 1920 squad. Other clubs such as Real Uni√≥n, Arenas Club de Getxo and Real Sociedad also provided players. These four clubs were all founding members of La Liga in 1928 and by 1930 they were joined by CD Alav√©s. This meant that five of the ten clubs in the Primera Divisi√≥n of Spain's national league were from the Basque Country. The saying \\"Con cantera y afici√≥n, no hace falta importaci√≥n\\", translated as \\"With home-grown teams and supporters, there is no need for imports\\", made sense during these early days.  The Fred Pentland era  1930-31 La Liga winner team In 1921, a new British coach, Fred Pentland, arrived from Racing de Santander. In 1923, he led the club to victory in the Copa del Rey. He revolutionised the way Athletic played, favouring the short-passing game. In 1927, he left Athletic and coached Athletic Madrid, Real Oviedo and the Spanish national team. In 1929, he rejoined Athletic and subsequently led the club to La Liga/Copa del Rey doubles in 1930 and 1931. The club won the Copa del Rey four times in a row between 1930 and 1933 and they were also La Liga runners-up in 1932 and 1933. In 1931, Athletic also defeated Barcelona 12‚Äì1, the latter's worst-ever defeat.  The league title under Garbutt  Athletic's success under British coaches continued with the arrival of William Garbutt from Napoli which made it to the top three in the Italian Serie A under his command for the first time in the club's history in 1932‚Äì33 and again in 1933‚Äì34. He had previously won the scudetto three times with Genoa and as a result arrived in Spain in 1935 as a well-respected coach, despite his reputation being non-existent in his native England. His first season in Spain was a massive success as he won the LigaEdgerton (2009), p. 117-124 that year. He had inherited a talented squad which included strikers Guillermo Gorostiza, La Liga's top scorer in 1930 and 1932, and Bata, the top scorer in 1931.Edgerton (2009), p. 120-121 The year prior to Garbutt's appointment was not a success for the club; they only finished fourth (in 1934‚Äì35) despite having been the 1933‚Äì34 winners. Garbutt set about galvanizing what was an already strong Athletic into action, which included promoting the young √Ångel Zubieta to the first team, a player who at 17 years of age went on to become the youngest ever to play for the Spanish national team at the time. Garbutt's first game was a 3‚Äì3 draw away at Oviedo on 10 November 1935, but he followed this up the next weekend with a 7‚Äì0 victory over Betis Balompi√©, who were the reigning champions.Edgerton (2009), p. 121 Garbutt's success continued with a 1‚Äì0 victory over Real Madrid on 12 January 1936, a significant victory as the two teams played \\"cat and mouse\\" over the following weeks in the race for the title. In the final game of the season, the title was decided when Athletic defeated Oviedo 2‚Äì0 at home on 19 April 1936, winning the title just two points clear of Real Madrid. This marked the return to success for the Athletic Club in a season which brought them their fourth title, and where Bata was the second top scorer with 21 goals. In July 1936, a mere three months after the end of the season, football halted due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The league did not restart until the 1939‚Äì40 season. Athletic Club did not win the title again until 1943 and by that time Garbutt had been exiled by Mussolini's fascists in Italy after having returned to coach Genoa in Serie A.  Atl√©tico Bilbao  Basque derby of 1944, Real Sociedad vs. Athletic de Bilbao in the Atotxa stadium. In 1941, the club changed its name to Atl√©tico Bilbao, following a decree issued by Franco, banning the use of non-Spanish language names and scrapping the policy of only letting Basque-born players in the team (see origins of the \\"grandparent rule\\"). The same year also saw Telmo Zarra make his debut. Over the next 13 seasons, he went on to score 294 goals in all competitions for Atl√©tico, plus another 20 international goals for Spain in as many games. His 38 goals in the 1950‚Äì51 season stood as a record for 60 years before ultimately being broken by Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. Another great player from this era was Jos√© Luis Panizo. In 1943, the club won a double of Liga and Copa del Generalisimo (the new name of the Copa del Rey) and they subsequently retained the Copa in both 1944 and 1945. During the early 1950s, the club featured the legendary forward line of Zarra, Panizo, Rafa Iriondo, Venancio and Agust√≠n Ga√≠nza. They helped the club win another Copa del Generalisimo in 1950. The arrival of coach Ferdinand Dauƒç√≠k improved the club's fortunes further. He led the team to another double in 1956 and to further Copa del Generalisimo victories in 1955 and 1958. In 1956 the club also made their debut in the European Cup, eventually being knocked out by Manchester United. What helped the club succeed in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s were the strict limits imposed on foreign players. In most cases, clubs could only have three foreign players in its squad, meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game. While Real Madrid and Barcelona circumvented these rules by playing dual citizens such as Alfredo Di St√©fano, Ferenc Pusk√°s, Jos√© Santamar√≠a and Ladislao Kubala, Atl√©tico adhered strictly to their cantera policy, showing little or no flexibility. The 1960s, however, were dominated by Real Madrid, and Atl√©tico only had a single Copa del Rey win in 1969. Like international teams, the club has used the \\"grandparent rule\\", allowing the recruitment of some players of Basque descent. This enabled the Barcelona-born Armando Merodio to play for the club. During the 1960s, however, other players such as Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Pereda, Miguel Jones and Jos√© Eulogio G√°rate were overlooked. Although none of them were Basques by birth, all three grew up in the Basque Country and could be classified as naturalised Basques; G√°rate even had Basque parents. On a positive note, the 1960s saw the emergence of a club legend Jos√© √Ångel Iribar. Dani (L) and Iribar (R) along with coach Aguirre (C) The 1970s were not much better, with only another single Copa del Rey win in 1973. In December 1976, before a game against Real Sociedad, Iribar and Sociedad captain Inaxio Kortabarria carried out the Ikurri√±a, the Basque flag, and placed it ceremonially on the centre-circle ‚Äì this was the first public display of the flag since the death of Francisco Franco. In 1977, the club reached the final of the UEFA Cup, only losing on away goals to Juventus. By then the Franco regime also ended and the club reverted to using the name Athletic.  The Clemente years  In 1981, the club appointed Javier Clemente as manager. He soon set about putting together one of the most successful Athletic Bilbao teams in the club's history. Young players from the cantera such as Santiago Urquiaga, Miguel de Andr√©s, Ismael Urtubi, Estanislao Argote and Andoni Zubizarreta joined veterans Dani and Andoni Goikoetxea. In his first season in charge, Clemente led the team to fourth place in La Liga. In 1983, the club won La Liga and in 1984 they won a La Liga/Copa del Rey double. In 1985 and 1986, Athletic finished third and fourth respectively. Clemente's Athletic acquired notoriety for its aggressive style of play, personified by hard-man Goikoetxea. He favoured two defensive midfielders playing in front of twin centre backs and a sweeper, and as a result, critics regarded his teams as dour but effective. Athletic has failed to win a major trophy since the success of the Clemente era. A succession of coaches that included Jos√© √Ångel Iribar, Howard Kendall, Jupp Heynckes and Javier Irureta and even a returning Clemente failed to reproduce his success.  The Fern√°ndez era  One of the most successful Athletic coaches since Clemente's tenure was Luis Fern√°ndez, appointed in 1996. In 1998, he led the club to second in La Liga and UEFA Champions League qualification. Fern√°ndez benefited from the club adopting a more flexible approach to the cantera. Now anybody could play for Athletic, just as long as they acquired their skills in the Basque Country. Thus, Patxi Ferreira from Salamanca and Biurrun, a Brazilian-born player who immigrated to the region at a young age, played for the club in the late 1980s. Despite this new approach, their definition of a Basque is still open to interpretation, with both Roberto L√≥pez Ufarte and Benjam√≠n being overlooked despite having Basque parents. Fern√°ndez signed Bixente Lizarazu (the first French-born Basque to join the club), Ismael Urzaiz (from Tudela in southern Navarre but trained at Real Madrid's La Fabrica academy), and Jos√© Mari Garc√≠a and Santiago Ezquerro (Osasuna youth graduates born in La Rioja). Athletic also began to recruit players from the canteras of other Basque clubs, leading to allegations of poaching. In 1995, Athletic signed Joseba Etxeberria from regional rivals Real Sociedad, causing considerable bad feeling between the two clubs. Although Lizarazu left after one season, Urzaiz, Jos√© Mari and Etxeberria were prominent members of the 1997‚Äì98 squad, along with the returning Rafael Alkorta, Ferreira and regular stalwart Julen Guerrero. In May 1998, Athletic played against the Brazil national team to mark the club's centenary, with the South Americans putting out a full-strength team as they prepared to defend their status as title holders at the upcoming World Cup in France.Hist√≥ricos de San Mam√©s VIII: Athletic - Brasil, la fiesta del centenario (Histories of San Mam√©s VIII: Athletic - Brazil, the centenary party), Vavel, 6 May 2013Athletic Club 1‚Äì1 Brasil, Athletic Bilbao  The \\"black biennium\\"  After Jupp Heynckes' second cycle in charge as manager (2001‚Äì2003), and Ernesto Valverde's first (2003‚Äì2005), the club was embroiled in a relegation battle during the 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07 seasons. In 2006, top-flight survival was ensured on the 37th match day when Deportivo de La Coru√±a were beaten at the Estadio Riazor 2‚Äì1. Javier Clemente then began his third spell as club coach in 2005, when the club were last in the table. He is widely acknowledged to have brought defensive stability to the team, and so is also credited with having saved the club from relegation. Despite this, he was not left in charge for the 2006‚Äì07 season, which turned out to be the worst in the club's history; top-flight survival was ensured on the last match day when Levante were beaten at San Mam√©s 2‚Äì0, a result which was alleged a few years later to have been rigged.  The Caparr√≥s era  In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Athletic again achieved unspectacular results and finished in mid-table, though they ensured safety from relegation earlier than in the previous campaigns. In the Copa del Rey, however, the team pulled through some tough ties, including local rivals Osasuna and a strong Sevilla side, to reach their first final in the competition in 24 years. The match in the city of Valencia against Barcelona was a great occasion for the fans, and though they lost 4‚Äì1, the result was no disgrace, as the Barcelona side of that season also proved unbeatable in La Liga and the Champions League. Athletic's reward for their efforts was a place in the 'new' UEFA Europa League tournament for the following campaign. The 2009‚Äì10 season saw Athletic make steady progress in the league and in Europe. Decent home form, including a victory over Real Madrid, led to the team sitting comfortably in the top half of the Liga and qualifying from their Europa League group, although poorer performances away from Bilbao meant that a really successful run never materialised. In 2010, the home games often resulted in draws rather than victories, and this also proved to be the case in the Europa League, where a draw at San Mam√©s against Anderlecht was followed by a heavy defeat in Belgium. Ultimately a promising season delivered little, with Athletic finishing eighth, just outside of the European places. Young stars Javi Mart√≠nez, Markel Susaeta and √ìscar de Marcos performed well, if inconsistently, providing for main striker Fernando Llorente, while 16-year-old forward Iker Muniain made a successful breakthrough into the squad. At the other end of the career scale, 500-game man Joseba Etxeberria retired after 15 seasons at the club, and Francisco Yeste, who had also played over 300 games, left rather abruptly at the end of the campaign. The 2010‚Äì11 season started positively, with Llorente scoring several times in early games. The team eventually achieved qualification for the Europa League with one match remaining, in 6th place. A defensive crisis led to Borja Ekiza from the B squad being drafted at centre-half, and he retained his place with solid performances. Teenager Iker Muniain started almost every match, and Jon Aurtenetxe claimed the starting place at left-back before a bad injury finished his season early. The signing of Ander Herrera was agreed although he elected to stay with his club Real Zaragoza until the summer as they battled against relegation.  The Bielsa era  √ìscar de Marcos in Moscow Prior to the 2011‚Äì12 season, Athletic's members held their latest presidential election, with incumbent Fernando Garc√≠a Macua defeated by former player Josu Urrutia. One of Urrutia's election pledges had been to bring in former Argentina and Chile head coach Marcelo Bielsa, and he fulfilled this promise.Josu Urrutia confirma a Marcelo Bielsa como su entrenador si es presidente (Josu Urrutia confirms Marcelo Bielsa as his manager if he is president); Cadena SER, 30 June 2011 (in Spanish)Bielsa: \\"Hay una proporci√≥n adecuada entre esfuerzo y creatividad\\" (Bielsa: \\"The proportion between effort and creativity is just right\\"); Marca, 7 July 2011 (in Spanish) Joaqu√≠n Caparr√≥s left as his contract expired, having improved Athletic's stature during his stewardship. Bielsa joined with a reputation for using unconventional formations and tactics. Several players began the campaign playing in unfamiliar positions, including World Cup-winning midfielder Javi Mart√≠nez, deployed as a ball-playing central defender and √ìscar de Marcos, used in several matches at left-back despite being known as a midfielder.De Marcos: \\"Est√° bien lo de ser comod√≠n, he jugado m√°s que el a√±o pasado\\" (De Marcos: \\"I'm fine with joker role, i've played more than last year\\"); Canal Athletic, 12 September 2011 (in Spanish) Initial results were not good and new signing Ander Herrera was injured. The players began to adjust as the season progressed and produced a strong run of autumn form, finishing top of their Europa League group ahead of Paris Saint-Germain.Athletic attacking prowess puts paid to PSG; UEFA.com, 29 September 2011 They defeated and defeated Lokomotiv Moscow in the last 32.

They lost the first leg in Portugal 2‚Äì1 after initially taking the lead, but beat Sporting 3‚Äì1 at home with goals by Markel Susaeta, Ibai G√≥mez and the winner from Llorente in the 89th minute in front of a fervent home crowd which edged them through to the final, 4‚Äì3 on aggregate.Athletic leave it late as Llorente sets up final date; UEFA.com, 26 April 2012 Athletic Bilbao fans in Bucharest before the Europa League final In their first European final since 1977, Athletic could not maintain their momentum and deliver their first trophy in 28 years, as they lost 3‚Äì0 to Spanish rivals Atl√©tico Madrid (inspired by the forward play of Radamel Falcao), on 9 May in the final at the Arena Na»õionalƒÉ in Bucharest. Although crushed by this disappointment, there was still another chance to claim glory having reached the 2012 Copa del Rey Final by defeating giant-killers Mirand√©s. Athletic faced the same opponent in the final as in 2009, Barcelona, who proved too strong in another 3‚Äì0 result. Being Copa runners-up meant that Athletic qualified for the 2012‚Äì13 UEFA Europa League, even though they ended the league season in tenth place. Going into the 2012‚Äì13 season, Athletic went through a period of some turmoil. The Europa League run meant many top players were being scouted by clubs who could offer higher wages and almost definite Champions League football. Fernando Llorente, whose contract was nearing its end, failed to agree a new deal and it then it emerged that fellow Spain international Javi Mart√≠nez possibly wanted to leave as well. With few replacements available under their signing policy, Athletic took a rigid stance on the matter, whereby no offers would be accepted and players would have to meet their inflated contract buyout clause to leave. Mart√≠nez did so, joining Bayern Munich before the transfer deadline despite Athletic's refusal to cooperate. Llorente failed to secure a move despite the bad blood which had developed with the club management over the situation. Marcelo Bielsa also had a major disagreement with the contractors working on improvements to the Lezama training ground. Experienced striker Aritz Aduriz returned from Valencia for a third spell, while winger David L√≥pez departed. With this backdrop of uncertainty Athletic began their season with poor results. The possession football did not lead to enough goals scored without the presence of Llorente and the Bielsa tactic of using players regarded as midfielders in defence to boost the overall technique level of the team backfired as opponents created chances with ease. 'old' San Mam√©s in 2007 They were eliminated from the Europa League group stage, failing to beat debutants Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona of Israel at home, and there was further embarrassment as they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Basque club Eibar of the third tier. Relegation was a threat until a decent run towards the end of the season, and the final league game at the \\"old\\" San Mam√©s ended in a 0‚Äì1 defeat to Levante. Athletic would soon be playing in a new stadium, San Mam√©s Barria, albeit in a partially completed state. Bielsa promoted young French defender Aymeric Laporte into the side as a potential replacement for Fernando Amorebieta and he later signed a long-term contract with the club. Fernando Llorente, who played only a peripheral role, eventually completed a free transfer to Juventus.  The Valverde era  The 'new' San Mam√©s in a partially completed state in 2013 With the departures of manager Marcelo Bielsa, forward Fernando Llorente and defender Fernando Amorebieta, Athletic looked to replace them in the transfer market. They would begin by replacing Bielsa with former player Ernesto Valverde, who had had a previous spell as manager at the club. They quickly moved to sign Be√±at from Real Betis to reinforce the midfield, while also picking up two defenders in Xabier Etxeita and Mikel Balenziaga. Finally, to give the club another, more viable attacking option in tandem with Aritz Aduriz, they signed striker Kike Sola from Osasuna. With these reinforcements, as well as youth breakouts such as Aymeric Laporte and Jon√°s Ramalho, Athletic looked to have a bounceback-season. Ernesto Valverde at a Champions League press conference With a very successful 2013‚Äì14 campaign, which included a 1‚Äì0 victory over Barcelona, they finished fourth in the league, meaning a new exciting UEFA Champions League campaign. Stars Aritz Aduriz and Ander Herrera shone, meaning the summer would be full of begging suitors for their players, and indeed, the summer transfer market began with a bid for Herrera; a ‚Ç¨36 million deal was finalized in June 2014 with Manchester United. In the first weeks of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Athletic had a triumphant first full-capacity match in the new San Mam√©s as they defeated Napoli to qualify for the Champions League group stage, however they could only finish 3rd behind FC Shakhtar Donetsk and FC Porto and were then knocked out of the Europa League by Torino. Athletic reached the final of the Copa del Rey, but once again lost to Barcelona, 3‚Äì1. Captain for the occasion was Andoni Iraola, playing in his final match after over 500 appearances for the club. He was the only Athletic player to start the 2009, 2012 and 2015 cup finals (Susaeta appeared at some point in each of them, as did four men from Barcelona). In addition to qualifying for the subsequent Europa League through their league position, Athletic qualified for the 2015 Spanish Super Cup as cup finalists. The reserves at Bilbao Athletic won promotion to the Segunda Divisi√≥n for the first time in 19 years. Beginning the 2015‚Äì16 season in the first leg of the Super Cup on 14 August 2015 at San Mam√©s, Athletic historically defeated Barcelona 4‚Äì0, with Aritz Aduriz scoring a hat-trick. In the return leg at Camp Nou, Athletic hung on with a 1‚Äì1 draw to win their first trophy since 1984. Aduriz continued to score freely throughout the season, finishing with 36 goals in all competitions; this form earned him a place in the Spain squad for Euro 2016 along with clubmate Mikel San Jos√©. Other strong performances, notably from youngsters Sabin Merino, I√±igo Lekue and I√±aki Williams and new signing Ra√∫l Garc√≠a contributed to a strong 5th- place finish in the league. In Europe, Athletic won their group in the Europa League and advanced to the quarter-finals where they were only defeated on penalties by the holders and eventual repeat winners Sevilla FC. Long-serving club captain Carlos Gurpegui retired from playingGurpegui ve \\"el momento perfecto para dejarlo\\" (Gurpegui sees this as \\"the perfect moment to quit\\"); Marca.com, 11 May 2016 to become a member of the coaching staff, and Bilbao Athletic were relegated back to the Segunda Divisi√≥n B after just one season. San Mam√©s exterior at night The 2016‚Äì17 season produced solid results with an almost unchanged squad, although youth graduates Yeray √Ålvarez and Kepa Arrizabalaga established themselves in the team. A run of four wins in September led to Valverde receiving the La Liga Manager of the Month award for the period. Overall, good home form (43 points) but poor away results (20 points) meant that Champions League qualification was never a realistic possibility. A keen contest for the Europa League places was fought with Villarreal, Real Sociedad and Eibar, until the latter fell out of the running after the meeting at Ipurua was settled by a stoppage-time winner from Ra√∫l Garc√≠a. That victory was one of six in seven games for Athletic in April, however only one point was collected from the final three fixtures in May, while on the last matchday Villarreal got the win they needed for 5th place and Real Sociedad scored a last-minute equaliser in their match, taking the 6th spot by one point. Athletic had to await the outcome of the 2017 Copa del Rey Final to determine if they would compete in continental football the following season - that match was won by Champions League qualifiers Barcelona, and the last Europa League berth therefore passed to Athletic (until a rule change a few years before, it would have gone to cup runners-up Alav√©s). In the cups, involvement in the Copa del Rey ended in familiar fashion with elimination by Barcelona (for the sixth time in ten seasons, including three finals). A highlight in the Europa League was Aduriz scoring all Athletic's goals in a 5‚Äì3 home win over Genk, a competition record, but despite a 100% home record in the tournament, a loss to APOEL was suffered in the first knockout round due to a weak away performance. Veteran goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz, who had still been first choice at the start of the season, was allowed to leave at the end of his contract, having played nearly 400 games in his 10-year-spell. As the season reached its conclusion, on 23 May the club announced that Ernesto Valverde would be leaving his position, bringing to a close his four-year cycle at the helm. The following day it was confirmed that his successor would be former player Jos√© √Ångel Ziganda, moving up from Bilbao Athletic, on an initial two-year contract. Valverde was subsequently appointed the new manager of Barcelona. The Ziganda era Ziganda's spell in charge, controlling a squad which was virtually unchanged from the previous year, began with the third qualifying round for the 2017‚Äì18 UEFA Europa League, with Athletic facing FC Dinamo Bucure»ôti, a team they had never previously met in European competition. After overcoming the Romanians, Athletic defeated Greece's Panathinaikos to reach the group stage. On 29 November the club suffered a shock defeat to SD Formentera ‚Äì a club experiencing their first- ever season in the third tier ‚Äì in the opening round of the domestic cup, conceding the critical goal in stoppage time at the end of the second leg when a goalless draw would have been sufficient to progress.

Only two of his works are known: a lost book on optics, entitled Optics, and an extant short treatise on siege machines, Construction of War Machines and Catapults ().Simon Hornblower, \\"Biton\\", in Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth (eds.), The Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd rev. ed. (Oxford University Press, 2005). The Greek may be transliterated Kataskeuai polemikon organon kai katapaltikon. The military treatise is dedicated to a king named Attalus (), evidently a king of Pergamon, either Attalus I (241‚Äì197) or Attalus II (159‚Äì38). Some scholars have suggested, based on internal evidence, that the text should date to 156‚Äì55.Francesco Fiorucci, \\"Biton of Pergamon\\", in Roger S. Bagnall, Kai Brodersen, Craige B. Champion and Andrew Erskine (eds.), The Encyclopedia of Ancient History (Wiley, 2013), pp. 1140‚Äì41. His translation of Biton's title is Construction of War Engines and Artillery. Biton describes the construction of four non- torsion catapults. The two built by Charon of Magnesia and by Isidoros of Abydos he calls \\"stone throwers\\" (lithoboloi), while the two attributed to Zopyrus of Tarentum are termed gastraphetes. He also describes helepolis (siege tower) built by Poseidonios the Macedonian and the sambuca built by Damis of Kolophon, which was a kind of wheeled scaling ladder. One of the more difficult to understand passages involves a part of the sambuca called the kochlias, which is either a roller or a screw, mounted horizontally or perhaps vertically. To historians, Biton is valuable as the only ancient witness other than Hero of Alexandria to mention non-torsion catapults. The lost treatise on optics is known only from Biton's references to it in the military treatise. He says that in his optical work he describes a method for calculating the height of walls, which is necessary in order to calculate the proper dimensions for siege engines attacking those walls.

He hosted the Radio Rhodesia morning show for much of his career. In the 1960s and 70s, he was the most popular radio personality in Rhodesia. Born in England, Sullivan emigrated to South Africa with his parents as a young man, and served in the South African Army in World War II. He relocated to Portuguese Mozambique in 1952, where he first worked in radio broadcasting. In 1959, he took a job working for the Federal Broadcasting Corporation, and relocated to Southern Rhodesia, hosting the Radio Rhodesia morning show. Sullivan died in 1978 in Rhodesia.  Early life  Leslie Smulian (later changed to Sullivan) was born on 11 April 1916 in England, United Kingdom. As a young man, he trained in London with Samuel Messener as an estate agent. In 1938, he moved to the Union of South Africa with his parents. During World War II, he served in the Second Battalion of the Transvaal Scottish Regiment.  Career   Early career  Upon completing his military service, Sullivan returned to South Africa, and worked selling commercial properties for businessman J. H. Isaacs. He then worked as a salesman selling Gestetner photocopiers. Though he was a successful salesman, he wished for a career change. In March 1952, he started work at Louren√ßo Marques (LM) Radio as an announcer. He soon became one of the most popular LM Radio announcers.  Radio Rhodesia career  In 1958, after six years at LM Radio, Sullivan was offered a position as an announcer and producer at the Federal Broadcasting Corporation (later the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation and today the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation). The FBC was based in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (then part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland). Commercial radio was just being introduced in Rhodesia at that time, and Sullivan was hired as the first morning announcer on the new commercial service when it started on 6 April 1958. Sullivan would arrive at the studio about 45 minutes before Radio Rhodesia went on air each morning, and would have a \\"power sleep,\\" waking just before the show started. At about five minutes before 6:00, he would present his \\"thought for the day,\\" usually an inspiration message. Between 6:00 and 6:30, news and the weather forecast were reported, then some music would play, and then Sullivan would go back on air. He greeted the audience with \\"Six-thirty, get up up up up up!\\" to wake up the listeners. That was usually followed by a children's song, though his audience included many adults as well. Hennie Bekker was the show's resident pianist. The program also included a segment in which Sullivan would welcome new Rhodesian immigrants by name. He would also commonly tell jokes, many of which had a radio quality (for example: \\"What do you call an African terrorist financed by Rowntrees Trust? ... A chocolate soldier.\\") Sullivan was, for most of the Rhodesia's history, the most popular radio personality in the country. The Prime Minister Roy Welensky said that after himself, Sullivan was the most popular person in Rhodesia. With his catchphrase \\"Your little ray of sunshine,\\" he was the best known media broadcaster. He remained with the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation until his retirement from radio in 1976, and was succeeded by Leslie McKenzie. He died in 1978.

These data might include but are not limited to: general economical or social trends in the market, sales volume of products, or even performance of staffs pointing to their efficiency and productivity. Despite the business field, data culture is also applied in the social infrastructure system, such as urban planning projects, in order to impact the process of data production and data practices of daily usage, such as Smart City programs. In general, to build data culture, the departments and organizations have to let the data talk itself, and trust the steering of statistics. Being successful as a data-driven entity requires the active participation of all staffs involved in an organization, therefore open access to data is significant in the process.  History  The idea of data culture has been under the spotlight of business field since the beginning of the 21st century, and is gaining popularity in recent years. Although first introduced in a scientific approach, the idea is now associated with both the science field and social sectors. * In 2000, Geoffrey C. Bowker conveyed the idea of \\"local data culture\\" in his academic paper in terms of biodiversity. * In 2014, Microsoft made a series of announcements including their intention to build data culture into everyday life through their services including Office 365, Azure and SQL Server. * In 2015, Microsoft organized a series of workshops about data culture in alliance with Hortonworks and KPMG UK, offering data analysts and other professional working in the field of Big Data an opportunity to understand the data culture of the company and help them build their own data culture in private sectors. * The Data Power Conference 2017 was held in Canada at Carleton University, Ottawa, June 22-23, 2017.  Components and roles   Participants  Participants are both producers of data and people who can contribute to the data culture by making influential changes. In the building process of data culture in a particular entity, employees at different levels are all supposed to obtain the ability of illustrating their works with relative statistics. This includes but is not limited to the goal of their job, the purpose of a specific task, and solutions they could bring up according to problems pointed out by data. Also, participants are allowed to make decisions within the section they take charge of, and experience changes happened due to their innovations.  Data scientists  Data analysts serve as an important part in the establishment of a data culture, as they often receive first-hand material and raw data, and the way they connect all the components together can determine the efficiency of communication between ordinary participants and decision-makers. Also, they are responsible for the analysis of information conveyed by the data. Having data scientists in each specific section of a company would be an ideal situation for a data-driven entity, therefore guaranteeing data access whenever needed.  Decision-makers  Decision-makers are those who apply changes and determine the direction of development in a company. In this case, they would make important decisions according to the trends and information highlighted by the data produced either in their own companies internally or statistics of the target market they want their corporations to aim at. Also, to build a data culture, decision makers have to emphasize their intention of requiring data analyses, therefore driving the motivation of staffs to deal with raw materials.  Data-driven companies   Microsoft  The Microsoft team, under the management of Satya Nadella, depends on data to drive both major market decisions and their daily behaviors. Microsoft focuses on data visualization and advocates that participants and employees should have the right to access the company's data. The company uses tools such as Power BI in order to have individual workers get involved and contribute to the future of the company.  Capita Capita is a British agency that assists clients in both government departments and enterprises to understand themselves better, using advanced techniques of data analysis. Established in 1984, they advocate their clients to build their own data culture with relative database in their own field of career.  Socrata Socrata is a US-based company which serves both public sectors and the civil society. They assist companies and organizations reach open data from the federal government in order to either improve the working progress of the government or assist social groups that are lack of resources. Their core value is tied to open data and they tend to focus on corporations which are in need of funding in order to process data analysis. The cloud-based service they provide allow government departments to communicate with the public through publishing their official data.  Data culture  Data culture is a German company (datenkultur GmbH) which serves business intelligence products and services. It was founded in 2003 and is active in building company data culture since 2006. The technical services are based on Microsoft products like SQL Server data warehouse and Power BI, but the BI strategic services are not directly connected to a product line. The goal is to help controlling employees or board member to use the existing data more effective and efficient. The necessary tools are based on the business needs and not the other way around.  Counter opinions   Data privacy  Some companies feel that it is important to keep the data private at the executive level. Although it is possible for all staff in a company to produce and process the data together, it is restricted for data to be free from the approach of participants at the elementary level. Some companies use the idea of Data Warehouse, a system that limits access to data. Only people in charge could access the data, and other people requiring access need to go through the assessment of warehouse staff.  Efficiency  As long as data bureaucracy is convenient for open access to databases, the large number of users might slow down the speed of processing in a particular system. Also, it might be difficult for users to search for what they want if the data bureaucracy system is not facilitated with proper tools. In this case, Data Warehouse would be more efficient for users who are not able to perform professionally when they seek for data.  Rationalism  A rational method of building or expanding an enterprise is an opposite approach to an empirical one. The decisions of rationalists are often evaluated according to their personal spirit and their existing cognition of the world. In terms of this approach, decision-makers depend on logic rather than social phenomena and phenomena appearing at the front line of an industry to make changes. The fact that decision-making process is not limited to the executive team anymore lead to the hesitation of some people on the management level, therefore they refuse to develop data culture.

After her husband's death, she moved with her seven children to New York City and was well known for her entertainments. In 1892, she married a Spanish parliamentarian and moved to Europe, where her children were educated. Two paintings of her, painted by Francisco Masriera y Manovens are in the collection of the Museo del Prado in Madrid. When she was 14, she married Justo Rufino Barrios and immediately became the first Guatemalan First Lady in history to take office. Early life Francisca Aparicio y M√©rida was born on 23 July 1858, in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala to Francisca Gregoria M√©rida y Estrada and Juan Jos√© Aparicio y Lim√≥n and baptized the following day at the . She was the third child in the family of eleven children and the oldest daughter. Her father owned the Santa Cecelia coffee plantation, which contained 400,000 coffee plants, the largest privately-owned plantation in the Suchitep√©quez Department and a second coffee farm which had 100,000 plants. During the uprising led by Miguel Garc√≠a Granados against the President Vicente Cerna in 1871, Justo Rufino Barrios was stationed in Quetzaltenango and met the young girl. He became infatuated with her, but her parents, thinking she was too young, sent her to Guatemala City to the school run by Ursuline nuns, which catered to the upper classes in the country. Not giving up his pursuit, when Barrios was elected to the presidency in 1873, he won-over the objections of her parents to his marriage proposal. Later, Barrios made her father governor of the Quetzaltenango Department, which gave him the authority to distribute the land in the area. First Lady of Guatemala On 24 July 1874 Aparicio married Barrios in a civil ceremony in her home town. According to custom, they were then married in a religious ceremony on 5 August 1874 at the Catedral del Esp√≠ritu Santo. A grand ball held to honor the couple took place amidst an earthquake which initially was believed would not be serious. The quake left around 200 people dead and destroyed or severely damaged six towns. In spite of her young age, Barrios entrusted Aparicio with the duties of state, placing her in charge of political and state functions both at home and abroad. They traveled extensively in the United States and Europe during his presidency and the couple had seven children: Elena (1875‚Äì1944), Maria de la Luz (1876‚Äì1949), Jose Ignacio (1877‚Äì1895), Maria Josefa (1878‚Äì1959), C√°rlos (1880‚Äì1897), Justo Rufino, Jr. (1882‚Äì1909) and Julia Francisca (1884‚Äì1905). Within a few months of her youngest daughter's birth, her husband was killed on the battlefield in 1885, while trying to unite the countries of Central America into a confederated state. Francisca Aparicio y M√©rida, Marquesa consorte de Vistabella by Francisco Masriera y Manovens, 1892 Almost immediately after her husband's funeral, de Barrios, who had inherited her husband's fortune outright, set sail with her children for San Francisco. They remained in California briefly before moving to New York City. Around the same time, her parents also moved to New York to establish an office to facilitate distribution of his agricultural products in the United States. In New York, she bought the property located at 855 Fifth Avenue, which quickly became a gathering place for Spanish-American society figures of the city. She enjoyed entertaining in her opulent mansion, decorated with Latin American artworks, and was known for her dancing and skill with classical music. She also had a private opera and was known for engaging local artists for performances and lavish costume balls. Her entertainments were widely covered in the society press with descriptions of her gowns and extensive collection of jewelry. In 1891, accompanied by her mother and family, de Barrios traveled to Barcelona for the International Exposition. From Barcelona, they traveled to Madrid, where at a circus party, she met Jos√© Mart√≠nez de Roda, , a Spaniard, whose family were from Granada. Roda was a member of the Spanish Congress of Deputies and the two saw each other often during the social season. They entered into an engagement and the following spring, on 21 April 1892, the couple married at de Barrios's home on Fifth Avenue. A double service was performed with Hugh J. Grant, mayor of New York City performing the civil service and Archbishop Michael Corrigan performing the religious ceremony. When the family moved to Europe, Perry Belmont, a one-time Minister to the court of Spain, took over her house on Fifth Avenue. For the next several years, the family made their home traveling between Madrid, Biarritz and Paris. In June 1899, her father died in New York City. Six months later, in December 1899, the Marqu√©s de Vistabella died suddenly while the couple was in Paris, leaving the Marquesa widowed for a second time. For the remainder of her life, the Marquesa de Vistabella's daughter Elena was her constant companion. Elena never married. When the Marquis de Vistabella died, having no children himself, he designated his wife's son Justo Rufino Barrios y Aparicio as his heir. When Justo died in 1909 in Paris, as he had no heirs and his mother had no more living sons, the title passed to her oldest daughter, Elena. Maria de la Luz, the second daughter, married Juan Alcal√° Galiano y Osma, the Maria Josefa married D. Tom√°s Terrazas y Azpeitia, Marquis de la Ensenada. In 1940, the Marquesa moved to Switzerland. Death and legacy The Marquesa died on 31 January 1943 in Bern, Switzerland. Francisco Masriera y Manovens painted two portraits of her, which are now in the collection of the Museo del Prado in Madrid. One is an oil on canvas painted in 1889. The other oil painting was completed in 1892.

Commercial breweries In 1886, the British Raj converted a cannon factory in Mandalay, established in 1859 by Crown Prince Kanaung, into a brewery. Edward Dyer was the first brewer and the brewery was known as the Dyer Meakin (Burma) Brewery. During the Japanese occupation of the country, the Takasago Beer Company ran the brewery, renaming it to the Takasago Brewery, which later was converted into a miso and soy-sauce factory when raw materials for beer production came into short supply. In 1954, the brewery was nationalised and renamed the State Brewery. During the early 1960s, the ownership and brewery's name changed numerous times; the Mandalay Brewing and Distillery, the Burma Beverage Ltd and the Industrial Development Corporation. In 1965 the company fell under the control of the Food Management Division of the Ministry of Industry and its name changed to the People's Brewery and Distillery, however by the early 1990s it was bankrupt. In 1993, a joint venture was formed between a Singapore-based company, Yaung Chi Oo Trading, and the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). The joint venture came to an abrupt end in November 1998 when the brewery and its operations were again nationalised. The Mandalay Brewery is currently owned by Myanmar Brewery Ltd. Myanmar Lager Beer On 29 March 1995, the first new commercial brewery in Myanmar, Myanmar Brewery Ltd, was formed as a joint venture between Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) and Asia Pacific Breweries (APB), (a joint venture between Singaporean drinks producer, Fraser and Neave and Dutch brewer, Heineken), with a total invested capital of US$30 million. The company's brewery located on a site in the Pyinmabin Industrial Complex, Mingaladon, Yangon commenced operations in September 1996. The brewery had an initial capacity of 140,000 hectolitres and produced Tiger Beer and Myanmar Beer. In 1997 APB transferred its 55% stake in the company to Fraser & Neave, amid international condemnation of the human rights abuses by the country's military government at that time. Dagon Beverages Company Ltd, a joint venture between Myanmar Economic Corporation, Bermuda's Brew Invest and Myanmar Golden Star (MGS), was established in 1998 producing Dagon Lager Beer. The joint venture introduced Dagon Extra Strong Beer in 2005, Dagon Super Beer in 2014, and Dagon Light Lager Beer in 2016. In February 2013, the Carlsberg Group secured one of four foreign beer brewing licences. The Danish company formed a joint venture with Myanmar Golden Star (MGS), establishing Myanmar Carlsberg Company Ltd and began construction of a US$75 million brewery in Bago in October. On 7 May 2015, the brewery commenced operations, brewing Carlsberg, Tuborg and a Myanmar-specific brand called Yoma. In July 2015, Heineken International established APB Alliance Brewery Company Limited, a joint venture with Alliance Brewery Company. The company's US$60 million 330,000 hectolitre brewery, in Hmawbi, produces Tiger, Heineken, ABC and a new local brand, Regal Seven. In August 2015, Myanmar Brewery ceased producing and selling Tiger and ABC, as it gave up its rights to the brands when it split from Fraser and Neave, with the Kirin Company purchasing Fraser and Neave's holding in the company. Microbreweries In January 2017, Myanmar opened its first craft beer microbrewery, Burbrit, a contraction of Burma and Britain, in recognition of the British influence on the nation's brewing history.

It aired on October 24, 2017, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Joshua Green, and directed by Barbara Brown. Plot Several movement followers emerge from Kai's house as Vincent arrives. Vincent congratulates his brother on his win. They discuss Ally's actions. Vincent says that he is proud of his brother's accomplishments to make a difference and that he wants to help expand Kai's message nationally. A hug ends with Kai's request that Vincent now addresses him as \\"Councilman\\". At the restaurant, Ivy and Winter serve several of the followers, who scorn the food for being healthy and make harassing and belittling comments about the women. Beverly, who is also working in the kitchen, says that their plan to topple the patriarchy died when Kai developed an army. She recounts the last night's city council meeting, where Kai introduced his army of followers as an officially armed patrol for the city. One councilman named Perry objected, and Kai unsubtly threatened his daughters, which changed the councilman's vote. Beverly wants to attack Kai, but Winter defends her brother. Beverly urges Winter that Kai considers her expendable. Winter recounts a story where she and Kai infiltrated an ultra- conservative religious order via an internet chat room. They proceeded through a sequence of rooms. One included a mother being tortured for aborting her fetus. Another had a junkie strapped to a frame, forced to overdose on drugs. Another featured a gay man whose judgment is meant to be impalement by knives through the chest, but Winter and Kai rescued him and the others throughout. Winter reached the door and was confronted by the deranged Pastor Charles, who was, in turn, knocked out by Kai. When the pastor awakened, Kai has strapped him down. Kai explained that the expectant mother actually had only an infection, the junkie was kidnapped from rehab, and the gay man was volunteering at an AIDS clinic. Kai dispensed the same \\"justice\\" to him that Pastor Charles inflicted, impaling him on the knives. After that, Winter recounts, Kai went darker and became more intent on righting wrongs. Winter intends for the story to convince the other women of Kai's goodness. Winter says she will intercede, and that Kai will listen to her. Beverly is skeptical, and vows to take her own action if their situation does not change by the end of the week. Winter visits Kai in the inner sanctum. He says he intended Harrison to work in the kitchen, until they killed him. He sits with his pinky at the ready, and Winter joins him. He explains that her total loyalty is required, and he's about to explain to her her role. He breaks off the pinky ritual and says that Winter is to bear the new Messiah. She is horrified at the thought of incest, but he explains that Samuels is to act as a medium between them. As Samuels inseminates Winter, Kai intends to be inseminating him, leaving her \\"pure\\". Vincent committed Ally for three weeks, and now won't leave her house. She says he didn't believe her before, but he responds that he does now and that Kai is dangerous. Showing her a family photograph, he explains that Kai is his brother. Ally also realizes that Winter (Ivy's new lover) is Kai and Vincent's sister. She suddenly realizes that Kai accessed Vincent's files on her and he says he will ensure that Ally is reunited with Oz. A robed Samuels and Winter await Kai in the inner sanctum, and Kai tells them that the time of \\"anointing\\" is at hand. He launches All 4 One's \\"I Swear\\" to begin the ritual to take place (which he considers a holy song now). The men disrobe and he anoints her with oil. She lays down at his bidding, and he kisses Samuels. Following Kai's instructions, Samuels is to enter Winter, but cannot get erect. Kai explains that this isn't sex, it's holy ritual. Winter and Samuels object, and Kai insists that \\"no one is above the law\\". Ally cooks in her kitchen and invites Kai in for dinner. He enters, flanked by bodyguards. She says that she didn't invite him to threaten him, but to offer information. Ally asks for a moment alone with Kai, and he reluctantly sends the bodyguards aside. She wants a promise of Oz back in exchange for what she has to say. She tells him that Vincent intends to commit Kai, and she details his upcoming betrayal. She says that Kai's actions ultimately have cured her of her fears. With that, Kai decides he will eat her offered food after all. Winter picks up trash in an orange jumpsuit and dunce cap. Samuels arrives in a car, calling her \\"servant\\", to bring her gruel. Her penance is to pick up the trash, but she will also throw it back onto the ground as Kai does not believe in global warming. He denies her an apple, and he tells her how he met Kai (who was using Vincent's prescription pad to sell fake prescriptions). Samuels blackmailed Kai into being his partner. Kai entered Samuels' apartment (full of Nazi memorabilia), finding him unable to stay erect for a woman (who stormed out) without strangling her. Kai explained to him that Samuels was unsatisfied with women, and that he needed a man. The two had sex, and Samuels continues to insist to Winter that he's not gay, \\"it's much more complex than that.\\" Winter throws the gruel in his lap, Furious, he unbuckles his belt and tries to rape her. She takes his gun, and holds it on him. He will not declare himself \\"a turd\\", as Valerie Solanas would have had him say. She shoots him through the head. In the inner sanctum, a clown-masked Kai bids \\"bring the betrayers\\" to him as the cultists chant \\"my ruler\\". A hooded Beverly and Vincent are led in. Vincent begs to be set free, but admits that he's trying to get Kai healthier. Kai reveals that Vincent created the \\"pinky-power\\" ritual, Kai engages Vincent in the ritual and severs Vincent's pinky. Winter unmasks herself and looks on in horror as Kai slashes Vincent's throat. He orders the others to drag Vincent's body away. Beverly is untagged and asks what is going on. Kai tells her she threw her all his plans for her away. Winter told Kai that Beverly was the one to kill Samuels, which Beverly declares a lie. Beverly calls him an insecure, incompetent attention whore. He says that death is too good for her, and instructs to take her to the isolation chamber. He addresses the assembled and welcomes the newest member as Ally unmasks herself (to Ivy's horror) as the new Satanist clown. Reception \\"Winter of Our Discontent\\" was watched by 2.06 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 1.0 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Winter of Our Discontent\\" holds a 77% approval rating, based on 13 reviews with an average rating of 7.88 out of 10. Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 out of 5, saying \\"With \\"Winter of Our Discontent\\", American Horror Story: Cult goes really dark. The series ventures into a contemporary dystopia, just like the one we're living, only with more sad clowns. Ultimately everyone is a betrayer, and everyone gets stabbed in the back, unless they are knifed in the throat. The show doesn't end on a completely down note, though. In the series' traditional last-minute twist, we learn Ally is going to get her son back after all.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a A-, and particularly enjoyed the last scene with its reveals. She is also pleased that the episode doesn't see the threesome scene through to its \\"repulsive conclusion\\". However, she criticized the use of the Judgement House, calling it \\"a blatant ripoff of Se7en\\". Vulture's Brian Moylan gave the episode a 4 out of 5, with a positive review, saying \\"There is a lot of great, cutting Trump satire in this episode. While late-night hosts and facile sitcoms like Will & Grace go for the easy Cheeto-faced joke, AHS cuts a lot deeper.\\" He also enjoyed the questions about Samuels' sexuality, saying \\"You might think that is some crazy rationalization for some man-on-man action, but it‚Äôs not all that unique. Kai‚Äôs speech sounds exactly like Jack Donovan, a real-life homosexual alt-right figure who has a male partner of 20 years but doesn‚Äôt identify as gay.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 6.8 out of 10, with a mixed to positive review. He said \\"Cult offered up a cool new take on Ally this week, but the rest of it buckled under the burden of this season's trend of never showing us the truth right away. Not ever knowing if what you're seeing is real is quick way to push one out of the story and into viewer-defense mode where nothing good can come. At some point soon, an episode needs to take us through everything straight arrow- style - but would we even trust it then?\\" References External links * American Horror Story: Cult episodes Fratricide in fiction ","title":"Winter of Our Discontent (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"55232435","text":"Kamehameha I is a bronze sculpture depicting the founder and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii of the same name by Thomas Ridgeway Gould, installed at the United States Capitol Visitor Center's Emancipation Hall, in Washington, D.C., as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection.

It has also been reported to cause subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis and mycetoma in very rare cases. In the natural environment, it can be found in rotting wood, soil, wasp nests, and plant debris. P. verrucosa is sometimes referred to as Phialophora americana, a closely related environmental species which, along with P. verrucosa, is also categorized in the P. carrionii clade. History The fungus was first isolated by Edgar Mathias Medlar in 1915 from a chronic skin lesion on the buttock of a 22-year- old man in Boston, Massachusetts who presented with verrucous lesions on the buttocks and feet. In consultation with Roland Thaxter, Medlar considered the fungus to represent a previously undescribed genus because the successive separation of the conidia and their maintained attachment to the cup-shaped portion of the sporogenous cells were unique characteristics not seen in any other genus. He named the genus Phialophora, meaning \\"shallow cup bearer\\" to represent the characteristic shape and the species epithet verrucosa, in reference to the resemblance of the lesion to \\"verrucous tuberculosis\\". Thaxter suggested that P. verrucosa should be classified under the subdivision, 'Chalarae' of Saccardo's classification system. Morphology and physiology P. verrucosa produces vase-shaped phialides with dark brown, cup- shaped collarettes. Each phialide is typically 3-4 Œºm wide and 4-7 Œºm long. Teardrop-shaped, smooth-walled conidia are formed at the apices of the collarettes and accumulate in clusters. Conidia are typically 2.5 - 4 Œºm by 1.5 - 3 Œºm in size. Hyphae are brown, cylindrical, and septate and are composed of thick-walled cells. The hyphae do not produce conidia.P. verrucosa grows well over a range of temperatures, with an optimal growth temperature of . Colonies grow slowly on oxalic acid and malt extract agar. Grown on Sabouraud's agar at , the colony attains a diameter of 3‚Äì4 cm after 2 weeks incubation. Ecology Although P. verrucosa was originally discovered in human tissue, it is known to occur naturally in soil, plant debris, wasp nests, and rotting wood. In a study where multiple strains of P. verrucosa were found growing in rotting wood, soil, and the bark and log of pine trees in Japan, it was found that these isolates from the natural environment had no distinct differences from P. verrucosa isolated from human tissue. P. verrucosa is widespread and can be found in Africa, Asia, Australia, North and South America, and Europe. Most strains of P. verrucosa available in culture collections are derived from human mycoses. Pathology P. verrucosa is a common cause of chromoblastomycosis, and a much rarer cause of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis and mycetoma. All three diseases have the potential to become chronic. P. verrucosa has also been reported to cause cutaneous infections, prosthetic valve endocarditis, and mycotic keratitis. However, due to its low pathogenicity, P. verrucosa does not often cause infection. Infections caused by P. verrucosa can occur in both immunocompromised individuals, such as individuals who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapies or who have AIDS, as well as in healthy individuals. A healthy individual who became infected with P. verrucosa gained initial exposure through direct contact of the skin with soil containing the fungus. Cases of chromoblastomycosis, subcutaneous phaehyphomycosis, and cutaneous infections caused by P. verrucosa have been reported to present with crusted, warty lesions found on the face, hands, shin, and sole of the foot. Lesions are rarely observed on the back and upper limbs. Treatment Antifungal drugs like itraconazole and terbinafine are typically used to treat infections caused by P. verrucosa. Amphotericin B, another antifungal drug, is only used occasionally, as it is cardiotoxic and is unsuitable for long-term therapy. While the spread of chromoblastomycosis to the muscle and bone is usually rare, in cases where antifungal drugs alone are insufficient in controlling the dissemination of the infection, limb amputation is required. Topical heat therapy, such as the use of disposable pocket warmers that sustain a temperature of 40 ¬∞C or greater for a period of 12 hours, as well as localized cryotherapy, may be effective in preventing the growth of P. verrucosa and treating lesions. P. verrucosa exhibits some resistance to antifungal drugs, and prescribed treatments often require a combination of antifungal drugs. The use of fluconazole, followed by the combined use of oral itraconazole and the topical application of copper sulphate solution, was reportedly successful in treating a phaehyphomycotic ulcer caused by P. verrucosa. In vitro, different isolates of P. verrucosa respond differently to the same combinations of antifungal drugs. The combination of amphotericin B and terbinafine was observed to cause a synergistic effect for some isolates but cause no effect in others.

Retrieved 28 July 2017.  Writing  Baek Young-ok's fiction often deals with the desires of women. However, the focus of her writing is not on which desires women have. Rather, Baek Young-ok's stories put more emphasis on how the desire for becoming more beautiful, or the desire to gain more attention from people are used by society to take advantage of women's bodies. Women's desires and the colonisation of women's bodies is clearly shown in works that specifically deal with the world of celebrities. Her major work Sta-il (Ïä§ÌÉÄÏùº Style) presents actual existing actors, and she draws readers in by exposing or suggesting the illusion of actors. In the novel, the actors are emotional people who are very competitive about their looks and are highly neurotic. The other characters of the novel, the editor in chief of the magazine and the senior reporters, are fierce individuals who work with their mind and body, and pour out ‚Äòorgasms of exclusives‚Äô. However, the unique ‚Äòstar quality‚Äô only manifests from ‚Äòstyle‚Äô, their physical capital. This comes from their perfect beauty that has been improved by plastic surgery, their gender transcendence through which they can pull off ‚ÄòHedi Slimane‚Äô clothing, and their ‚Äòbarren‚Äô bodies that achieve the ‚Äòdestruction of boundaries‚Äô. The talent or the private concerns of the actors are secondary. In order to win the competition against other media, the stars must richly decorate themselves as well as their inner side, with the most fabulous and unique concept. The paradox that somehow the narcissism of actors addicted to ‚Äòimage‚Äô, and the interview decorated by collusive ‚Äòillusion‚Äô, must lead to a place of actual emotion, is the reality of celebrities shown by Sta-il (Ïä§ÌÉÄÏùº Style).Jeong, Mi-sook, \\"Women's Fiction and the Re-enactment of \\"Media Culture\\"\\", Modern Fiction Research 41, 2009.

Following the weakening and collapse of the Hamdanid Dynasty of Aleppo, much of the Near East lay open to Byzantium, and, following the assassination of Nikephoros II Phokas, the new emperor, John I Tzimiskes, was quick to engage the newly successful Fatimid Dynasty over control of the near east and its important cities, namely Antioch, Aleppo, and Caesarea. He also engaged the Emir of Mosul, who was under the suzerainty of the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad, over control of parts of Upper Mesopotamia (Jazira).  Background  Relations between the Byzantines in Greece and Asia Minor and the Fatimids in Egypt had taking a steep downward turn halfway through the 10th Century. Following the disintegration of the Hamdanid Dynasty in Aleppo, tensions between the two empires continued to inflate until conflict became inevitable. However, the Byzantines looked not only to expand into the Levant and Syria, following their conquest of Cilicia, but also too expand further east into Armenia and Upper Mesopotamia, modern Iraq, in order to unite with the native Christian peoples there and to cripple the power of the Abbasid Caliph, who was nominally under the suzerainty of the Buyids. Late in 969, John Tzimiskes, a prominent leader of the Byzantine army, assassinated Nikephoros Phokas, then the Byzantine Emperor, and ascended the throne. His reign, however, was almost immediately under threat, as in early 970 a large coalition of Slavic armies crossed the Balkan Mountains and invaded Byzantium; John would have to put any eastern campaign on hold. Meanwhile, in the east, the Fatimids crushed the last of the Ikhshidid resistance in Syria and consolidated their power in Cairo. John would swiftly repel the invading Slavic force at the Arcadiopolis, and, after conquering much of mainland Greece and Bulgaria in 971, the path for an eastern campaign was cleared. While John had been fighting in Bulgaria, the Fatimids managed to break into the Byzantine Empire itself and laid siege to Antioch, which had been captured from the Hamdanids six years earlier. Soon, by spring 971, an invading force of Qarmatians into Fatimid Syria forced the Egyptian army too withdraw.Romane (2015), pp. 70 The failure of the Fatimids to take Antioch proved the stability of Byzantium's eastern front, and, later in 971, John planned to initiate yet another eastern campaign. John left Constantinople in Spring 972 and crossed the Euphrates in October of the same year. John quickly besieged and entered the city of Nisibis which he used to stage numerous raids on the surrounding countryside. The Emir of Mosul, who was a suzerain of the Abbasid court at Baghdad, Abu Taghlib, soon agreed to pay annual tribute to the Byzantines. John then quickly moved towards Mayyafariqin, but he was unable to take the city before the campaigning season ended.  Domestic of the East  As the campaigning season ended, John appointed to the position of Domestic of the East an Armenian named Mleh; his job was to maintain stability at the frontier. During the winter of 972‚Äì3, Mleh collected a strong force of Byzantine soldiers with the objective of putting pressure on Abu Taghlib. He quickly set out for the border town of Amida, while Taghlib responded by sending an army under his brother Hibat Allah to challenge the invaders. Mleh's army was swiftly destroyed with a few survivors entering the captivity of Taghlib, including Mleh, who would die in captivity by March 974.Romane (2015), pp. 71 The defeat of Mleh was significant, as it undermined the Byzantine's position with the Armenians in terms of securing a possible alliance, as well as losing their annual tribute from Mosul. The defeat of Mleh would also cause a rift to form between Taghlib and the Caliph in Baghdad, Al-Muti, on the subject of how best to deal with the threat they posed. The Armenians soon held a conference, and, after discussing with Byzantine envoys, formed a deal to accompany the Byzantines in a joint invasion of Syria and Mesopotamia in Spring 974, John marched east and joined with the Armenian forces at the capital of Taron, Mu≈ü.  John's invasion  John swiftly advanced through Taghlib's lands, accepting tribute from Amida and Mayyafariqin in turn; he soon passed Nisibis, which was then deserted. John hoped to eventually advance on Mosul, and perhaps even Baghdad itself, thereby breaking the power of the Arabs in Mesopotamia whilst also increasing his legitimacy at home.Romane (2015), pp. 72 He soon advanced into Jazira. Later that year, however, John received news from across the fertile crescent: the Fatimids had crushed the Qarmatians in Syria and were now advancing up the Levant towards Antioch, having already taken Tripoli and Beirut. John realized that the risk posed to Antioch and Cilicia was far greater than any gains to be had from possessing Baghdad, and so he soon headed west, splitting his army in two. The Armenians were sent home and the Byzantines went on to resupply and refresh the garrison at Antioch. John then returned to Constantinople to celebrate a Triumph, and returned to the east in Spring 975. John, once again, marched out of Antioch and down the Orontes, quickly taking Homs. From there he besieged and took Baalbek, and then advanced on Damascus, whose ruler, Amir Aftakin, a refugee from Baghdad who had recognized Fatimid suzerainty, surrendered his lands to John. John then marched south, taking Galilee, Tiberias, and Nazareth. Envoys from Acre soon reached John's camp on Mt. Tabor accepting a Byzantine garrison. Envoys also arrived from Ramleh and Jerusalem expressing their desire for John to take their cities.Romane (2015), pp. 73 He soon took Caesarea, which would prove to be the limit of his advance. At this point John was far too concerned with the Fatimids' continual hold on the Levantine coast to advance further into Palestine. Important cities such as Tripoli, Sidon, and Byblos were still in Egyptian hands, and the clear threat these cities' garrisons posed to the integrity of Byzantine supply lines forced John to conquer these territories before advancing further. He proceeded to march to the coast and take Beirut after a fierce battle. He then marched north and took Byblos, heading towards Tripoli from there. Despite putting up a fierce siege and ravaging the countryside, John was unable to take the city. From there he marched north virtually unopposed, taking Balamea, Gabala, and numerous other cities. At this point, John now controlled all of the coast from Antioch to Caesarea, except for Tripoli. John then marched inland, mopping up any last pockets of resistance, including the cities of Burzuya and Sahyun. Governors and garrisons were appointed for the conquered cities, the administration arranged, and John returned to Antioch in September 975.Romane (2015), pp. 74  References   Sources  * 970s conflicts Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars 10th century in the Byzantine Empire Syria under the Fatimid Caliphate Campaigns of the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Syrian campaigns of John Tzimiskes"},{"id":"55233056","text":"Annasaheb Awate Arts, Commerce & Hutatma Babu Genu Science College, is an undergraduate and postgraduate, coeducational college situated in Mancher, Pune district, Maharashtra.

He cites the hard- driving bluegrass of the Stanley Brothers as a major influence on his approach to bluegrass music.  Biography  Early years Sisk was born in Arlington, but was raised in Ferrum, Virginia. His early interest in music was sparked by his father Harry Sisk Sr., who wrote songs and played guitar, and his mother who sang. When Sisk was 14, his parents gifted him with an upright bass. Sisk began performing in local bands at age 16, first playing bass but eventually switching to guitar. He also played in his family's band Dreamin' Creek with his father and cousins. Music career In the early 1990s, Sisk wrote songs made popular by the Lonesome River Band, such as \\"A Game (I Can't Win),\\" \\"My Heart Belongs to You,\\" and \\"Tears are Blinding Me.\\" Playing bluegrass every Saturday at Partners II bar in Centreville, Virginia, he met many other bluegrass musicians, such as Del McCoury, the Johnson Mountain Boys, and the Bluegrass Cardinals. In 1995, Sisk and his cousin songwriter Tim Massey began playing with Wyatt Rice and Santa Cruz, which also included Elmer Burchett (banjo) and Ricky Riddle (mandolin). They released the album Picture in a Tear in 1996. Sisk formed Rambler's Choice in 1998. Besides Sisk, the band included Massey, Elmer Burchett, Jimmy VanCleve, and Allan Perdue. Rambler's Choice released the album Sounds of the Mountains on Rounder Records, but dissolved in 2001. In 2001, Sisk worked with the band Lost and Found, then in 2002, he joined Baucom, Bibey and BlueRidge. BlueRidge toured extensively and recorded three albums, and disbanded in 2006 because Bibey wanted to join Grasstowne. In 2007, Sisk re-formed Rambler's Choice with Massey, Darrell Wilkerson (banjo), Chris Harris (mandolin), and Billy Hawks (fiddle) and in 2008, they released the album Blue Side of the Blue Ridge on Rebel Records. The album contained original and traditional songs, and was produced by Ronnie Bowman. Sisk and Ramblers Choice released Heartaches and Dreams in 2010, then in 2011 released The Heart of a Song which contained the popular song \\"A Far Cry From Lester and Earl\\" and climbed the bluegrass charts. In 2013, Sisk released the album The Story of the Day That I Died with Ramblers Choice, and also in 2013, released Hall of Fame Bluegrass, an album of duets with banjoist Joe Mullins. They selected songs from first and second generation bluegrass artists that has rarely been covered or heard. In 2017, Sisk released the album The Mountains Are Calling Me Home on the Mountain Fever label. The current lineup of Ramblers Choice includes Sisk, Jason Davis (banjo), Johnathan Dillon (mandolin), Jamie Harper (fiddle), and Kameron Keller (bass). Sisk has also worked with Ralph Stanley, Dave Evans, and Del McCoury. Awards In 2012, Sisk won the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) award for Song of the Year for \\"A Far Cry from Lester and Earl,\\" and he also won Album of the Year for The Heart of a Song. In 2013, he won the IBMA award for Male Vocalist of the Year, and in 2016, he won the award for Recorded Event of the Year for The song \\"Longneck Blues\\" (with Ronnie Bowman). In 2013, Ramblers Choice won the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America (SPBGMA) Bluegrass Band of the Year award.

It was one of the first transparent ceramics produced, and was invented in 1966 by Richard C. Anderson at the General Electric Research Laboratory while sintering mixtures of rare earth minerals.  Properties  Yttralox is a solid solution of thorium dioxide in yttria. The thorium dioxide additive affects the growth of grains during densification, leading to improved optical transparency. Uncontrolled grain growth allows a few grains to grow larger than the others, trapping pores inside them. The additive increases the grain boundary hardness more than the internal grain hardness. This causes porosity to remain on grain boundaries rather than becoming trapped inside grains, allowing them to be eliminated later in the sintering process. This greatly improves the material's optical transparency, because porosity causes light scattering. Porosities as low as one part per million were reported. The resulting grain size was in the range 10‚Äì50 Œºm. Yttralox was marketed as being \\"transparent as glass\\", has a melting point twice as high, and transmits frequencies in the near infrared band as well as visible light. However, it has little plasticity at high temperatures and low thermal conductivity, giving it a thermal shock performance little better than common glass.  Uses  Commercialization was limited because Yttralox required high sintering temperatures of 2000‚Äì2200¬∞C. Yttralox was proposed for use in lamp envelopes and high-temperature windows and lenses. It was investigated for use as a low- loss window material for lasers, for example in conjunction with a laser Doppler velocimeter for ramjet research. It was also investigated for use with infrared equipment in missiles. Neodymium oxide‚Äìdoped Yttralox was used as a proof of concept for laser gain in a polycrystalline oxide ceramic, but was not commercialized due to low efficiency. Yttralox's competing materials were an yttria containing lanthanum oxide manufactured by GTE, and a pure yttria material manufactured by Raytheon.  History  Richard C. Anderson, the inventor of Yttralox, holding an Yttralox disc Yttralox was invented in 1966 by Richard C. Anderson at the General Electric Research Laboratory while sintering mixtures of rare earth minerals. The initial objective of the research was to develop ionic conductors for fuel cells using yttria‚Äìzirconium dioxide materials. Although the zirconium dioxide-rich versions were of more interest for ionic conductors, the yttria-rich versions unexpectedly produced transparent samples. Further research established that other oxides of Group 4 elements, thorium dioxide and hafnium dioxide, were also effective at producing transparent yttria, and the thorium dioxide system became the most extensively studied. Further work at GE was performed by Paul J. Jorgensen, Joseph H. Rosolowski, and Douglas St. Pierre. Fabrication of Yttralox was reported by Greskovich and Woods.Greskovich, C. and Woods, K.N., \\"Fabrication of Transparent ThO2-doped Y2O3\\", Bull. Amer. Ceram. Soc., Vol. 52, p. 473 (1973) As of 1982, Yttralox was no longer being produced.

His casts in coloured sulphur and in white metal of works in both national and private collections, allowed smaller collections to hold copies at a fraction of the price that the originals would command. Thousands of his copies entered the collections of institutions and individuals. Yet the accuracy he achieved led to confusion with the originals; after his death he was labelled a forger, but with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\". Little is known about Doubleday's upbringing or personal life. Several sources describe him as an American, including the 1851 United Kingdom census, which records him as a New York-born British subject. An obituary noted that he worked at a printer's shop for more than 20 years during his youth, which gave him the experience of casting type that he would employ in his later career as a copyist. Doubleday's early life, family, and education are otherwise unknown. He died in 1856, leaving a wife and five daughters, all English; the eldest child was born around 1833. At the British Museum 1836 lithograph of Doubleday, by Henry Corbould From 1836 to 1856 Doubleday worked in the Department of Antiquities at the British Museum. He appears to have been employed as a freelancer who also occasionally acted as an agent in sales to the museum. At times he presented the museum with items including coins, medals, and Egyptian objects. Among other donations, his 1830 gift of 2,433 casts of medieval seals was the only significant donation recorded by the museum that year, he offered several coins and another 750 casts the following year, and in 1836, he presented the museum with a Henry Corbould lithograph of himself. A further presentation in 1837 was still considered, in 1996, to be one of the museum's most important collections of casts of seals. He seems to have been the museum's primary, and perhaps its first, dedicated restorer; his death was described as leaving the post vacant. At his death, it was noted that he was \\"chiefly employed in the reparation of innumerable works of art, which could not have been intrusted to more skilful or more patient hands\\", and that he \\"was well known as one of the most valuable servants of that department\\". Portland Vase The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional ¬£25 () for his work. At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured. The vase was next restored by J. W. R. Axtell in 1948‚Äì1949, and then by Nigel Williams in 1988‚Äì1989. Other works The shattered fragments of the Portland Vase, as painted in 1845 Beyond his work on the Portland Vase, several other of Doubleday's responsibilities at the British Museum have been recorded. In 1851 he successfully undid damaging restoration work by William Thomas Brande of the Royal Mint, who in using acid to clean bronze bowls from Nimrud had caused extreme oxidation. Doubleday's method, described at the time only as \\"a very simple process and without employing acids\\", is unknown, but may have used warm water with soap. Doubleday was again called upon when, between 1850 and 1855, the museum received clay tablets from excavations in Babylonia and Assyria. Some were poorly packaged and had developed crystalline deposits rendering the writing illegible. Under the direction of Samuel Birch, then the keeper of the Department of Oriental Antiquities, Doubleday attempted to remove the deposits. The results were described by E. A. Wallis Budge, former keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities at the museum, as \\"disastrous\\", but by modern reasoning as \\"prescient\\", for though unsuccessful, the underlying methods were subsequently refined by others. Doubleday first attempted to harden the tablets by firing them, but this resulted in the flaking of the surfaces, destroying the inscriptions. His second attempt, submerging the tablets in solutions, also resulted in disintegration, at which point Birch suspended the efforts entirely. Later attempts by other conservators in firing similar tablets were more successful; mainstream acceptance today is more tempered by concerns about reversibility than by concerns about efficacy. Doubleday is regarded as the inventor of this method, and his failures may have been caused by raising or lowering the temperature too quickly. Doubleday twice served as a witness in criminal matters. In 1841 he testified about his analysis of a gold medal during a trial concerning its theft. Eight years later Doubleday again testified, in March and April 1849, in a matter concerning the theft of coins from the museum. Early in February, Timolean Vlasto, a fashionable twenty-four-year-old from Vienna whose late father, Count Vlasto, had been a diplomat, had been introduced to Charles Newton (later Sir Charles) by a friend, who described Vlasto as a person interested in coins. Vlasto was given unfettered access to the museum's collection. Suspicions were aroused on 24 March, and on Monday the 26th a label was found on the floor; the coin that it described was missing. Upon inspection many more coins could not be found, but some were recovered when a search warrant for Vlasto's lodgings was obtained on Thursday. Doubleday was called to testify on Thursday or Friday; he stated that some of the coins exactly matched sulphur casts which he had made before the theft, and that the market value was between ¬£3,000 and ¬£4,000. Vlasto, who was remanded without bail, claimed that the majority of the coins discovered were not the museum's. On 17 April Doubleday again testified, identifying two more coins as belonging to the museum. In early May Vlasto pleaded guilty to the theft of 266 coins from the museum, valued at ¬£500, and another 71, valued at ¬£150, from the house of General Charles Richard Fox. Vlasto's lawyer termed him a monomaniac who was only interested in collecting, not selling. The pleas met little sympathy. Vlasto was sentenced by the Central Criminal Court to seven years transportation to Australia, and in early 1851 was placed on board the for the journey. As a dealer Apart from his work at the British Museum, Doubleday was a dealer and a copyist of coins, medals, and ancient seals. He sold sulphur and white metal casts, the former coloured in different hues, at his establishment, which, located near the British Museum, may have helped facilitate his employment there. He also sold curiosities, such as cabinets, snuff boxes, and lead seals purportedly made from materials taken from the charred ruins of the Palace of Westminster with the consent of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, and pieces of wood said to be from a tree planted by Shakespeare. In 1835 Doubleday advertised for sale copies of 6000 Greek coins, 2050 bronze, 1000 silver, and 500 gold Roman coins, and 300 Roman medallions, in addition to other antiquities and what Doubleday termed \\"the most extensive Collection of Casts in Sulphur of ancient seals ever formed\\". By 1851 he had casts of more than 10,000 seals, and at his death it was said that he \\"possessed the largest collection of casts of seals in England, probably in the world.\\" This comprehensiveness led to his contribution to the 1848 Monumenta Historica Britannica of a descriptive catalogue of Roman coins relating to Britain. More unique pieces he sometimes exhibited, either himself or by loan to Sir Henry Ellis, to the Society of Antiquaries of London. Doubleday's casts came from a range of places; on good terms with a variety of institutions and collectors, he was permitted to take casts at will from the collections of the British Museum and the Biblioth√®que nationale in Paris. Doubleday's casts were inexpensive, and sold widely. He was well known among collectors, and also sold to lyceums; University College London filled out their collection with his casts, finding them cost-effective substitutes for study. This same appearance of realism saw some of Doubleday's copies passed off as real. Doubleday was cast as a forger in Leonard Forrer's 1904 Biographical Dictionary of Medallists, though with the caveat that \\"[w]hether he did copies with the intention of deceiving collectors or not is open to doubt\\". Personal life Doubleday's headstone in Kensal Green Cemetery Little is known about Doubleday's personal life, and nothing about his upbringing or education. An 1859 edition of The English Cyclop√¶dia described him as American, and the 1851 census as a New York-born \\"artist\\" who was nonetheless a British subject, married to one Elizabeth and father of five daughters, all Londoners. His eldest daughter, also an Elizabeth, was born around 1833, suggesting that Doubleday and his wife had married by then. Doubleday worked at a printer's shop in his youth for more than 20 years, according to his obituary in The Athen√¶um, giving him experience through making type in the casting of metal and other materials. Subsequently, he began copying medals, ancient seals, and coins, occasionally devising new methods of doing so; he also prepared castings for the Royal Mint, and become a founding member of the Royal Numismatic Society. By 1832 he was listed in directories under the heading \\"Curiosity, shell & picture dealers\\", and as a dealer in ancient seals. As well as his work at the British Museum, he may have been a collector. According to the obituary in The Athen√¶um, Doubleday died \\"after a long illness\\" on 25 January 1856, \\"in the fifty-seventh year of his age\\". The illness was termed \\"extreme\\" by colleagues, such that he was unreachable for months. Obituaries were published in The Athen√¶um and The Gentleman's Magazine, and he was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. His will was made only six days before his death. His entire estate was left to Elizabeth Bewsey, the daughter of a deceased bookkeeper; she was apparently not the Elizabeth to whom Doubleday was married, making it a bequest that seemingly left nothing for his wife or daughters. His library was sold by Sotheby's that April. The 322 lots combined to fetch ¬£228 2s6d ().
