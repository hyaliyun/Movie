Recorded quickly after the moderate success of his self-titled debut album, Field Day featured a change in style and production after Crenshaw switched producers from Richard Gottehrer to Steve Lillywhite. The recording of the album was remembered positively by Crenshaw as was the album's sound. Despite the success of its predecessor, Field Day was a commercial disappointment, reaching number 52 in the United States while its lead single, \\"Whenever You're on My Mind\\" reached number 103 on the singles chart. Critics were mixed, with most criticism geared toward the album's production. Despite this, Crenshaw remains supportive of the album and \\"Whenever You're on My Mind\\" has become one of Crenshaw's most famous songs. Background Field Day was recorded shortly after Crenshaw's self-titled debut album. Crenshaw recalled being rushed to release a follow-up to his moderately successful debut despite a lack of material; he explained, \\"I felt rushed doing Field Day but I was ready to take it on; I was ready to take up the challenge to do a second album. I had a couple songs leftover from my first album. I kept 'Whenever You're on My Mind' sort of in my back pocket for the future and I had 'For Your Love' that was unrecorded and laying around as a spare part. But the rest I wrote for the album.\\" Crenshaw selected British producer Steve Lillywhite to produce Field Day rather than Richard Gottehrer, the producer for his debut album; \\"What Time Is It?,\\" a song co-written by Gottehrer, was included on the album as a gesture of good will. Crenshaw explained his choice of Lillywhite in an interview, saying, \\"I was the one who brought Steve Lillywhite into the whole thing. People in Burbank at Warner Brothers never heard of him. My A&R; person at Warner Brothers in New York was really savvy and a really brilliant gal. Her name was Karin Berg. She knew who Steve Lillywhite was. It was kind of a chaotic scene but out of all this chaos was a record that's a keeper.\\" Recording Crenshaw recalled the sessions for Field Day as very positive and loose. He recalled, \\"We had a really great crew on that record. It was Steve [Lillywhite] and Scott Litt and Garry Rindfuss. All we did every day was just have fun. We were all really happy with the end result.\\" Field Day featured a bigger production than Crenshaw's debut, most notably with the drum sound. Crenshaw was pleased with this change of direction, saying \\"The thing is the tracks are really powerful and explosive, but there's never more than one guitar on it. There are some overdubs but the rhythm tracks are all just guitar, bass and drums. That made me really happy.\\" =Songs= Field Day features \\"Whenever You're on My Mind\\" one of Crenshaw's most famous songs. The track was one that Crenshaw had felt confident about, calling it \\"the bomb\\" in an interview. Field Day also features \\"Our Town\\", a song which Crenshaw explained was about \\"being homesick\\" for his then-hometown, New York City. Crenshaw later said that \\"Monday Morning Rock\\" was \\"about this sorta fast- paced life that I lived for a short time. I'm sure you've had the experience, where you walk out of the club and find out that it's the next day, that the sun is out, and you didn't know.\\" Artwork Field Day features an album cover of Crenshaw standing in front of a building facing forward. Crenshaw has expressed his dislike of the cover in multiple interviews, claiming it had been chosen while he was on a vacation with family. In one interview, he explained: Release and reception Field Day was a commercial disappointment after Crenshaw's debut, peaking at no. 52 in Billboard magazine, lasting 14 weeks on the chart. The debut single from the album, \\"Whenever You're on My Mind\\", was aided by a popular early MTV music video and reached number 103 on the charts as well as number 23 on Billboard's Rock Tracks Chart; Crenshaw attempted to leave Warner Bros. after the album's performance, but the label would not allow it. Field Day saw some positive reception from critics, particularly from Robert Christgau, who awarded it an A+ rating.http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2269 However, many writers were critical of the album's production. Crenshaw later defended the production, explaining in a later interview, \\"I had lunch with Steve about a year and a half ago. Hadn‚Äôt seen him in a long time. I'd read some interviews with him over the years where he was very contrite about the whole thing. He'd say, 'I feel like I really steered Marshall down the wrong path,' and all this stuff. I finally got sick of it. I said, 'I'm going to track his ass down, and we're going to talk about it.' [Laughs.] All in a very good-natured way, because I like him a whole lot. I told him, 'Steve, I want to remind you that there wasn‚Äôt a single thing about that record that didn't meet my approval. If there was anything I didn't like about it, it would‚Äôve gotten changed.' I had a really supportive A&R; person back then, and I absolutely had my eyes open. Always.\\" Crenshaw remains supportive of the album and considers it one of his best. He said, \\"I'd have to say that the music on Field Day is still very vibrant and full of life. It‚Äôs the sound of young people who are in love with life and just having a great time.\\" In another interview, he stated, \\"I really loved Field Day, even though it was a dumb idea to do a second album in such a hurry after the first one. I remember listening to the playback and feeling as good as I've ever felt about one of my records.\\" In 2017 independent vinyl reissue label Intervention Records reissued Field Day on 180-gram vinyl. The album package included a bonus 12\\" US remix EP, new cover art, and was Artist- Approved.

The consequence of being in the registry is that resolutions of incurring debt, or entering long-term rental contracts must be approved by Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development in order to be valid. Budgets must be approved by either the ministry or the County Governor. The registry was introduced in 2001. Prior to this, all counties and municipalities were required to have any debt and long term contracts approved. The new law narrowed this to local divisions with an economic imbalance. Since not being in the ROBEK registry gives the municipality much more economic freedom, the councils usually aim to stay out of the registry. The registry has sometimes been described as a blacklist. Municipalities often cut costs by reducing public services, and conducting lay-offs to get out of the registry. Increasing revenue through property taxes have generally been opposed by the local politicians. The rules determining whether a county will be entered into ROBEK are described in ¬ß60 of the law of municipalities and counties. According to this law, a county or municipality will be entered into the ROBEK registry if at least one of the following four criteria are met: *a) The municipality or county council pass a budget where not all expenditures have been covered. *b) The municipality or county council pass an economy plan where not all expenditures have been covered. *c) The municipality or county council resolve that an account deficit will be covered in future budget years. *d) The municipality or county do not follow their plan for covering a deficit. As of August 2010, there are 48 municipalities in the ROBEK registry. Budgetary troubles which land a municipality in the ROBEK registry are sometimes due to incurred losses from a large event, for example V√•gs√∏y winded up on the ROBEK registry in 2009 following losses after hosting a port-of-call for the Tall Ships' Races, and Narvik and Hattfjelldal were entered into ROBEK after the Terra Securities scandal.

It is also called anal‚Äìoral contact and anal‚Äìoral sex, and is additionally known by slang names. Health risks include fecal‚Äìoral transmission of diseases. Etymology and alternative names The term anilingus entered English through the 1899 F. J. Rebman translation of Edition 10 of sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's 1886 book Psychopathia sexualis.Mark Forsyth. The Etymologicon: A Circular Stroll through the Hidden Connections of the English Language. Icon Books, 2011, p. 49. Colloquial names include \\"rimming\\", \\"rim job\\", \\"eating ass\\" or \\"tossing the salad\\". Practice =General= Pleasure for the giver during anilingus is usually based more on the principle of the act. The anus has a relatively high concentration of nerve endings and can be an erogenous zone, and the recipient may receive pleasure from external anal stimulation. The person receiving anilingus is regarded as the passive partner in the act, and the person performing anilingus is the active partner. People may engage in anilingus for its own sake, before anal fingering or penetration, or as part of foreplay. Studies indicate that anilingus is a rare sexual practice between women. =Technique= Anilingus can involve a variety of techniques to stimulate the anus, including kissing or licking; it may also involve the tongue moving around the edge of the anus or up and down the insides of the cheeks of the buttocks, and in and out of the anus. Anilingus can be performed in a number of sex positions including: * the passive partner is on all fours in the doggy position with the active partner performing anilingus from behind. * the passive partner is on their back in the missionary position with their legs raised high with the knees drawn towards their chest, and with some sort of support (such as a pillow) under their hips for comfort and to raise their buttocks. With the partner's anus exposed, the active partner kneels between the partner's legs to perform anilingus. * the passive partner on top in the 69 position.Morin, J. (1998). Anal pleasure and Health. Oakland, CA: Down there press. The passive partner may lie down on the active partner in the missionary position, with legs raised high, from the front to raise the partner's buttocks to perform anilingus on the exposed anus. * often used in combination with the 69 position detailed above, another position has the active partner lying on their back with the passive partner sitting on their face. This position allows the \\"passive\\" partner to become more active or even completely dominant as they can now easily gyrate their hips and thrust their pelvis. * the rusty trombone, in which a male stands while the active partner performs both anilingus from behind, generally from a kneeling position, and also performs masturbation on the standing partner, thus somewhat resembling someone playing the trombone.Tate, Jordan. (9 January 2007) The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms. Publisher St. Martin's Press Health risks and prevention =Health risk= Anilingus has potential health risks arising from the oral contact with human feces. Diseases which may be transmitted by contact with feces include: bacterial diseases including shigellosis (bacillary dysentery); viral systemic diseases including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, poliomyelitis, human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus; parasites including intestinal parasites; and infections and inflammations chlamydia infection, gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, gonorrhea, lymphogranuloma venereum and other sexually transmitted infections. (from internet archive) Applying the mouth to the genitals immediately after applying it to the anus can introduce the bacterium Escherichia coli (\\"E. coli\\") into the urethra, leading to a urinary tract infection. HIV/AIDS is not believed to be easily transmitted through anilingus. Anilingus with a number of casual partners increases the health risks associated with the practice. Generally, people carrying infections that may be passed on during anilingus appear healthy. Parasites may be in the feces if undercooked meat was consumed. The feces contain traces of hepatitis A only if the infected person has eaten contaminated food. Another recent study suggests a correlation between oral sex and throat cancer. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV because this virus has been implicated in most cervical cancers. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral-sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity. Those with more than five oral- sex partners had a 250% increased risk compared with those who never engaged in this activity. =Prevention= Safe sex practices may include thorough washing of the anal region before anilingus to wash away most external fecal particles and reduce the risk of contraction of fecal-sourced infection. An enema can also reduce the risk of direct fecal contact. A dental dam may also be used, and another safe sex practice is to avoid unprotected sex which involves fellatio after anal intercourse. If the receiving partner has wounds or open sores on the genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in the mouth, or bleeding gums, this poses an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, and eating crunchy foods (such as potato chips) relatively soon before or after performing anilingus also increases the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and palate. These wounds, even when they are microscopic, increase the chances of contracting sexually transmitted infections that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. As punishment Forced and mostly public anilingus was used as a form of humiliation and punishment, usually of prisoners. The use of the practice in the Thirty Years' War was described by Grimmelshausen in Simplicius Simplicissimus (1668).Simplicissimus, The German Adventurer, trans. John C. Osborne, Newfound Press, 2008. The practice is commonly referred to as \\"arse licking\\", and the term is still at times applied to the behaviour of someone who is overly respectful or helpful to someone in authority. In the United States prison system, anilingus is one of the ways one prisoner pays his dues to another inmate. In prison slang, this activity is known as \\"tossing a salad\\".Marc Levin for HBO (1996). Prisoners of the War on Drugs (Documentary). IMDb. Retrieved 31 August 2013.

It is one of Soda Stereo's most famous and symbolic songs, whose musical influence has been remarkable in the history of Latin rock for over two decades. Due to its popularity, the song is considered an anthem of rock en espa√±ol. It was the last song performed on their farewell and semi-mythical concert \\"El √öltimo Concierto\\" in 1997. At the end of that song, the band's lead singer and songwriter Gustavo Cerati thanked the fans of the band with a phrase that became famous: \\"Gracias... totales\\" (Spanish for: \\"Totally... Thank you\\"). This moment is remembered as one of the all-time most exciting in the history of Latin American rock.  Composition  = Music = The title and spirit of the song was taken from some albums Gustavo Cerati's parents had, which were named \\"Light Classics of all Times\\" \\"The idea was to create instrumentation like that, very classical, of a band, and at the same time that had a light spirit.\\", Gustavo said. Like the lyrics, the music is deceptive: simple and complex simultaneously. The whole song is built from the riff and supported by the sequence carried out by the guitar. Four chords (Bm, G, D, A), emphasize the progression from G to D, where the power of the song is concentrated. The complexity of the harmony stems from the fact that the drop from D to G occurs in the middle of each verse and not the beginning or end as the effect could suggest at first glance. And it is exactly this lack of coordination between the singing and harmony which gives rise to the irresistible attraction that has become one of the most successful songs in the history of Latin rock. Cerati has said that \\"De M√∫sica Ligera is one of the most instant hits that I did with Soda Stereo.\\" Charly remembered that: = Lyrics = The lyrics of \\"De m√∫sica ligera\\" are surprisingly short, just seven lines. Their meaning is cryptic and intentionally ambiguous: a love of easy-listening, which Cerati recalls as something finished (\\"nada m√°s queda\\" (nothing else remains)), but also as a permanent presence (\\"nada nos libra\\" (nothing frees us)). In the first two verses, Cerati sings \\"ella durmi√≥ al calor de las masas, y yo despert√© queriendo so√±arla\\" (she slept to the heat of the masses, and I woke up wanting to dream about her). The expression is both beautiful and complex: it expresses a clash of states that are worlds apart (sleep and wakefulness), but also the desire to dream of that which has awakened him, to be reunited with her in his own dream. It also expresses her unconsciousness, lulled by the effect of the masses, faced with his lucidity, he cannot help waking up and seeing things as they really are. Then he sings \\"alg√∫n tiempo atr√°s pens√© en escribirle\\" (some time ago I thought about writing to her) but mysteriously informs us that he could not overcome \\"las trampas del amor\\" (the traps of love). The lyrics then conclude telling everyone that he will not send \\"cenizas de rosas\\" (ashes of roses), and \\"ni pienso evitar un roce secreto\\" (nor he will avoid a secret touch), confirming the duality that awakens \\"aquel amor de m√∫sica ligera\\" (that easy-listening- music love). Regarding the theme and the lyrics, Gustavo Cerati once said: The names are in reference to the most used sequence of notes in all rock & pop, inherited from '20s jazz. This sequence is utilized to teach bass, and has been widely played by hundreds of bands, in different octaves and variations.  Music video  The accompanying music video to the song was directed by Alfredo Lois and shows the band performing the song. He adopted a colorful and intentionally amateur style with background of flowers and psychedelic colors.  Sales and certifications   Related circumstances  * The song was the first release from the album Canci√≥n Animal (Animal Song) and made the group famous in Spain, thus completing its presence in the Latin world. * In the farewell concert (1997), De m√∫sica ligera was the last song. Gustavo Cerati announced it with the following words, ¬´tengo una buena canci√≥n para cantar¬ª (I have a good song to sing) and he closed with the now mythical expression, \\"Gracias...totales\\" (Thank you... totally). * In Brazil, the song was covered by the Os Paralamas do Sucesso, with the title \\"De M√∫sica Ligeira\\" (version: Herbert Vianna) on their 1996 album Nove Luas, and by the group Capital Inicial, with the title √Ä Sua Maneira (version: Dinho Ouro Preto) on their 2002 album Rosas e Vinho Tinto. * The British rock band Coldplay covered the song during a concert on their A Head Full of Dreams Tour in La Plata, Argentina, on November 14, 2017, and it was released as a track on their live album Live in Buenos Aires on the 7th of December 2018. *During 2020, 3 Latin rock icons release the great song of Soda Stereo, Los Rabanes from Panama, Beto Cuevas (La Ley) from Chile and Randy Ebrigth (Molotov) from Mexico in ska version By Rockass Online Music Record Label.

De Bermingham was enfeoffed by Strongbow with part of the kingdom of Ui Failghe, which became the barony of Offaly. Eve's mother's name and identity is not known. Sometime about 1193, she married her first husband, Gerald FitzMaurice, the second eldest son of Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan. He became the 1st Lord of Offaly by right of marriage to her. Together they had one recorded son: * Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly (1194- 20 May 1257), Justiciar of Ireland, married Juliana N. N., by whom he had four sons.

From DigitaltMuseum Frederik Schmidt (27 May 1771 ‚Äì 16 February 1840) was a Danish-Norwegian priest, politician, doctor of theology, poet and diarist. Biography Schmidt was born in Asminder√∏d, Denmark as the son of Christen Schmidt (1727‚Äì1804) and Petronelle S. Lemmich (1734‚Äì1798). His parents were of Norwegian descent, and they moved to Norway as his father became bishop in 1773. Schmidt enrolled as a student at the University of Copenhagen in 1787, and after a later hiatus he returned and graduated with the cand.theol. degree in 1791. He was a member of the Norwegian Society. Schmidt was a priest in Christiania from 1792, and started the periodical Hermoder in 1795, which he edited until 1797. In 1798 he became vicar of Eiker. He was promoted to dean in 1808. He also tried to become dean of Copenhagen, but did not receive the appointment. In 1817 he failed again, in becoming bishop of the Diocese of Bergen. He took an absence of leave of two years, and then resigned from his position in Eiker. In 1820 he returned to Denmark as vicar of Himmelev. He took the dr. theol. degree in 1826 with the thesis Historia Paulicianorum orientalium. Schmidt was elected to the Norwegian Constituent Assembly in 1814. He supported Crown Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark and his endeavor to become the new ruler of Norway. When Sweden stopped this plan with a military campaign, Schmidt accepted the subsequent union between Sweden and Norway. However, Schmidt took the initiative to a scrutiny of the Norwegian government's role in the military campaign. This initiative led to Norway's first Impeachment case, against Lieutenant General Fredrik Gottschalk von Haxthausen. Schmidt took this initiative has he had been elected to the first session of the Parliament of Norway, representing the constituency of Buskeruds Amt. He only served one term. He was also one of the co-founders of the Royal Norwegian Society of Development (Det Kongelige Selskap for Norges Velin) 1809. In 1813 he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. Frederik Schmidt died in February 1840 in Himmelev. Family and personal life Schmidt married Maren Elisabeth Mathea Oppen (1778‚Äì1841) in January 1799 in Christiania. Schmidt wrote poems, and releases include Samlede Digte (1811) and Ny samlede Digte (1835). He is also known for his diaries. Diaries for the years 1790, 1794, 1807, 1811, 1814, 1817, 1818 and 1819 have been preserved by the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen. Excerpts from diaries were released in 1868 as Provst Fredrik Schmidts Dagb√∏ger. A new edition came, in three volumes, between 1966 and 1985. These diaries are regarded as having significant historical value.

Unlike most of his contemporaries, he seldom submitted his own art work for publication. He published some of his own work in limited edition books such as Old Sydney (1911) and Old Colonial By-Ways (1928), prompted by his passion for preserving historic buildings. Early life He was born in London in 1887 and arrived in Australia with his parents later that same year. His father John (d. 1919) was manager of the Menzies Hotel, Melbourne and later of the Hotel Australia, Sydney for over 20 years. His parents adopted the form \\"Ure Smith\\": his mother (d. 1931) was born Catherine Ure, but formally their surname remained Smith. He was educated at Queen's College, Melbourne and then at Sydney Grammar School. He studied pencil and ink drawing at the Julian Ashton Art School (1902‚Äì07) and then learnt the techniques of etching from Eirene Mort. At age 19 he helped Harry Julius and Albert Collins found the commercial art studio that later became Smith and Julius. He died after several years of ill health and was survived by a son from his second marriage, Sydney George 'Sam' Ure Smith (died 19 November 2013) and a daughter, Dorothy Hemphill (died 15 March 2009). Business Artistic expression to him was never more than a pleasant pastime; his real passion lay in harnessing technology to reproduce the works of others. In 1916 he founded a syndicate with Bertram Stevens and Charles Lloyd Jones to publish Art in Australia, and in the same year he founded the commercial art studio and advertising firm Smith and Julius with Harry Julius, specialising in high quality artwork for prestigious clients such as Dunlop and Berlei. They employed such prominent Sydney artists as James Muir Auld, Fred Britton, Frank Burdett, Harold Cazneaux, Albert Collins (who was a director from 1916‚Äì51), Roy de Maistre, Adrian Feint, George Frederick Lawrence, Percival Leason, John Passmore, Lloyd Rees, Bill Sparrow and Roland Wakelin. After 1923 he ceased active involvement with the company. He founded magazine The Home, published monthly from February 1920‚Äì42, in the mould of Harper's Bazaar, Vogue and Vanity Fair. He founded Ure Smith Pty. Ltd. in 1939, initially to publish Australian National Journal (quarterly, 1939‚Äì47). He edited books on J. J. Hilder, Arthur Streeton, Blamire Young, Hans Heysen, Norman Lindsay, Elioth Gruner, Margaret Preston, George Lambert, Douglas Annand, Francis Lymburner and William Dobell.

Raised in 1916 for service during World War I the battalion served on the Western Front until the end of the war, before being briefly amalgamated with the 55th Battalion and then eventually disbanded in 1919. In 1921, the 53rd Battalion was re-raised and in 1927 adopted the title of the \\"West Sydney Regiment\\"; however, in 1937 they were once again amalgamated with the 55th, forming the 55th/53rd Battalion (New South Wales Rifle/West Sydney Regiment). In October 1941, during World War II, the two battalions were delinked and the 53rd was later deployed to New Guinea, where they took part in the Kokoda Track campaign. Poorly prepared and trained, and lacking up to date equipment, they did not perform well and were amalgamated with the 55th once more in October 1942, with whom they subsequently took part in further campaigns in New Guinea and Bougainville before being disbanded in May 1946. History =World War I= The 53rd Battalion was initially raised in mid-February 1916 as part of the expansion of the all-volunteer First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) that took place in Egypt during World War I.. Formed from reinforcements sent from Australia and experienced men drawn from the 1st Battalion, the 53rd was assigned to the 14th Brigade, 5th Division. Upon formation they took part in the defence of the Suez Canal against forces of the Ottoman Empire, for which they received their first theatre honour, that of \\"Egypt 1916\\", although they did not take part in any actual fighting. The battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel Ignatius Bertram Norris. Later, as the Australian infantry divisions were moved to the European battlefield, the battalion was moved to France in June 1916 where they took their place in the trenches along the Western Front. Their first involvement in the fighting came at the Battle of Fromelles on 19‚Äì20 July 1916, where the battalion took part in the first stages of the Allied attack. Norris, who personally led the battalion's advance, was mortally wounded by shell-fire as he reached the German line. The 53rd suffered 600 casualties at Fromelles, a toll that represented about a third of its total casualties during the war. Nevertheless, the battalion remained at the front for the next two months, before being withdrawn for a rest. Once that was over, the battalion rotated between manning defensive positions at the front and undertaking training and labouring duties in the rear areas. After spending the winter in the trenches in the Somme Valley, in early 1917 after the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line to shorten their lines of communication and free up reserves, the 53rd Battalion took part in the brief Allied pursuit, culminating in them being committed to hold the ground won during the Second Battle of Bullecourt. Later in the year, they were moved to Ypres in Belgium where they took part in the Battle of Polygon Wood in late September. Private William Currey, who received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Battle of Mont Saint- Quentin. In early 1918, following the collapse of Russia and the end to fighting on the Eastern Front, the Germans concentrated their forces in the west and launched a majority offensive, which became known as the Spring Offensive. As the Allies were pushed back by the offensive, the Australian divisions were brought south to the Somme to help blunt the German advance. Within this the 53rd Battalion manned defensive positions to the north Villers-Bretonneux, holding their positions even though the town fell into German hands during the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. When the Allied Hundred Days Offensive began in August, the 53rd Battalion was not initially involved although close to the end of the month it, along with the rest of the 14th Brigade were committed to the fighting around P√©ronne, with the 53rd Battalion attacking Anvil Wood during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin. For his actions during the fighting, one member of the battalion, William Currey, was later awarded the Victoria Cross. The 53rd Battalion's final involvement in the fighting came late in September when they took part in the Battle of St. Quentin Canal. Afterwards, they were withdrawn from the line along with the rest of the Australian Corps shortly after this and was still in the process of re-organisation when the Armistice came into effect. Shortly afterwards the process of demobilisation began. As numbers dwindled, the battalion was merged with the 55th Battalion in March 1919, although they were disbanded a month later on 11 April 1919. During its active service, the 53rd Battalion suffered 2,294 casualties of which 647 were killed. Aside from Currey's Victoria Cross, other decorations bestowed upon men from the 53rd were: five Distinguished Service Orders, one Officer of the Order of the British Empire, 25 Military Crosses with three Bars, 28 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 76 Military Medals with four Bars, four Meritorious Service Medals and 20 Mentions in Despatches.In addition to this, there were five foreign awards bestowed, although the sources do not elaborate as to what these were. The 53rd was awarded a total of 16 battle honours for its involvement in the war, receiving these in 1927. =Inter-war years= In April 1921, the AIF was officially disbanded and the following month the militia was reformed to perpetuate the designations and battle honours of the AIF. At this time the 53rd Battalion was re-raised around Sydney, the area from where many of the battalion's original recruits in 1916 had come. Upon formation, the battalion drew its personnel mainly from the 2nd Battalion, 53rd Infantry Regiment as well as parts of the 3rd and 45th Infantry Regiments. In 1927, when territorial designations were adopted, it became the 53rd Battalion (West Sydney Regiment). The same year, the battalion adopted the motto of \\"Be Prepared\\", although this was changed to Usque Ad Finemm in 1933. Due to the impact of the Great Depression, and a general complacency towards matters relating to defence, the battalion had few volunteers and limited funding and eventually, in October 1936, the decision was made to amalgamate the battalion. Initially, it was amalgamated with the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment); however, this only lasted a couple of months before they were delinked and in August 1937 the 53rd was amalgamated with the 55th Battalion, forming the 55th/53rd Battalion (New South Wales Rifle/West Sydney Regiment). This reformed a partnership that had begun at the end of the previous war and which would continue into the next. Throughout the inter-war years, the battalion maintained an alliance with the South Staffordshire Regiment. =World War II= At the outset of the World War II, due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas‚Äîinitial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly the United Kingdom‚Äîwhile it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness in the event of war in the Pacific through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of training. In October 1941, the 55th/53rd Battalion was undertaking a period of continuous training at Bathurst, New South Wales when it was announced that they were to be delinked once more and the 53rd would be sent to act as a garrison force in Darwin, Northern Territory. The battalion was brought up to full strength from other Militia units, but by December as they were due to embark for the trip to the north they were still below strength and in order to meet this shortfall they received a draft of 104 conscripts. Taken at short notice from units in the Sydney area, many of these men had just turned 18 and had received little or no formal military training. They embarked upon the Aquitania, but instead of being sent to Darwin they were diverted to Port Moresby, arriving there on 3 January 1942 and becoming part of the 30th Brigade. Japan had entered the war the previous month and the battalion was to form part of the garrison for the port in case of a possible invasion. Suffering badly from malaria and other tropical diseases, the men were mainly used to provide work parties instead of undertaking the training that they would require for the fighting that would come. In June, the 53rd was attached to Maroubra Force and the following month it was split up, with two companies‚Äî'B' and 'C'‚Äîbeing sent to the area around Kokoda to reinforce the 39th Battalion, while the remainder of the battalion remained around Port Moresby in preparation to move up the Kokoda Track. That month the battalion received eight officer reinforcements from experienced 2nd AIF units. On 10 August, the 53rd Battalion was ordered to relieve the 39th, which was at the time positioned around Uberi. The two detached companies moved into position and upon their arrival they finally received a number of Bren guns and had a small amount of training with them, but it was not enough to bring them up to the standard required for combat against the battle-hardened Japanese soldiers that they were about to come up against. 55th/53rd Battalion wounded, Sanananda, December 1942 Meanwhile, the rest of the battalion moved up to link up with 'B' and 'C' Companies. Upon arrival they took up a position around Isurava defending a parallel track to the main one, which bypassed the main Australian position. As the Japanese probed the 53rd's position confusion amongst the Australians reigned as the Japanese managed to infiltrate their perimeter and achieve a break-in. A number of the battalion's senior officers were killed in the attack, including their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Ward. As a result of this loss, communications between the companies broke down rendering co-ordinated action impossible and 53rd began to fall back. This came at the worse possible moment for the Australians, as it left a gap in their defences along the Kokoda Track, one which left the way open for the Japanese to march straight through to Alola. The Japanese, however, failed to exploit it before the 2/16th Battalion were brought up to plug the gap, and as a result a possible disaster was averted. Nevertheless, a certain amount of stigma was attached to the battalion's performance, and they were later described as \\"the mob\\". Instances of sickness and disease continued to deplete the battalion also, and by the beginning of September they were down to just 213 men. During this time 'C' Company was detached to support the 2/14th Battalion, while the main body was brought back to Efogi where they manned a defensive position along the track running to Kagi, and established a line through which the 21st Brigade and the 39th Battalion withdrew. Holding their position as required, the 53rd Battalion remained in the line until the night of 5 September when they were ordered to fall back along the track. Despite performing creditably following their initial exposure to the fighting, the stigma attached to their performance at Isurava stuck and they were ordered back further still and were eventually removed from the front line fighting, being utilised instead in mundane garrison duties in the rear areas, while 100 men were transferred to reinforce the 39th Battalion. A small draft of about 40 men were sent to the 36th Battalion around this time also, before, finally, on 27 October 1942 the battalion was amalgamated once again with the 55th Battalion. Around this time, the battalion's machine gun company was detached and in conjunction with several other Militia machine gun companies, it was used to form the 7th Machine Gun Battalion. The 55th Battalion had itself been involved in the campaign, serving around Port Moresby and Milne Bay and after they were linked once more the 55th/53rd went on to serve with success around Sanananda and then later during the Bougainville campaign in 1944‚Äì45. During the 53rd's brief involvement in the war, it lost 21 men killed or died and a further 23 wounded. There were no individual decorations bestowed on members of the 53rd; but, in 1961, the battalion was awarded four battle honours for the New Guinea campaign.

The complex includes the mill building, two vernacular dwellings, a 1910s gambrel roofed storage barn, a 1935 saw mill, two concrete faced dams, and a mill pond. History The grist mill was partly built in 1823 by Judge Charles Kellogg - a member of the New York State Assembly and later a United States Congressman - then sold to Horace Rounds in 1851. Rounds sold it to his son, Eugene Rounds, in 1865. In 1919 it was sold to W. E. Rounds and A. Ryan,New York State Education Department historical marker, accessed July 9, 2012 and it remained in the Rounds family until 1947, when it was sold to Howard Weed, Hubert Latta, and Leland Weed and renamed the New Hope Mills. Dale Weed became the sole owner in 2001. The mill is a heavy timber framed building with several late 19th century wings containing a full array of 19th century steel roller mills and related support machinery. See also: In the 1850s, there were 14 other industries powered by water along Bear Swamp Creek. The New Hope Mill originally had a capacity of 200 bushels a day, using three stones; it converted to roller mills in 1892. Although from the exterior the waterwheel is most prominent, most of the mill's power came from a water turbine underneath the structure, which can run throughout the year if sufficient water is available. The complex has an upper mill pond, where the sawmill is located, with a 24-foot waterfall, and a lower mill pond with a 28-foot fall. Water could be stored in the upper pond to be used to run the mill the next day. The New Hope Mills company, which produces pancake, muffin, scone and cookie mixes, moved its manufacturing operations to nearby Auburn, New York, in 2003, but still owns the old mill and preserves it with the intention of converting it into an operating museum. The New Hope Mills Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

These proposals are then discussed at open meetings, to which a guest expert is invited. The guest helps establish the background of the policy area and helps to determine a suitable approach to the topic. Most proposals are published on the think tank's website. In addition to policy research, the Society functions at the centre of Cambridge student political life, as a focal point for mutual dialogue between students and frontline policymakers. TWS Ideas events provide a relaxed setting for informal debates on broad questions of public policy. The Society has established links with YouGov, the UK opinion polling and market research company. YouGov data is also used in policy papers. Previous policy research has included commissions from Stephen Barclay MP, End Rape on Campus, and Daniel Zeichner MP.

He was born in Frederikshald as a son of major Georg Frederik Rode and his first wife Vilhelmine, n√©e Stockfleth. He took a military education in Denmark, and became second lieutenant in 1784. He was promoted to premier lieutenant in 1790 and captain in 1800, and in the same year he became aide-de-camp for the governor in Rendsborg, Prince Frederick of Hesse. Rode was also a teacher at the military institute in Rendsborg from 1800 to 1808. He was promoted further to lieutenant in 1803, major in 1809 and lieutenant colonel in 1809. In 1809 Frederick of Hesse was appointed as commanding general in the southern part of Norway, and Rode followed him here. Frederick of Hesse left Norway in 1813, whereas Rode stayed. He became a prominent figure in society, and participated in the Meeting of Notables in February 1814. When the former Crown Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark was elected King of Norway by the Norwegian Constituent Assembly in May 1814, Rode was appointed chamberlain with the rank of colonel in the same month. During the Swedish campaign against Norway of the summer, which would eventually oust Christian Frederick, Rode commanded a brigade--which did not see military action. Despite the change that occurred when Norway and Sweden formed a union, Rode remained a prominent figure. Having become general commissary of war in October 1814, he remained so until his death at the farm S√∏ndre Hellerud in December 1830.

Work Kinder researched his first book for seven years before publishing it. Victim is based on the real characters and events of the Hi-Fi Murders that occurred on April 22, 1974, in Ogden, Utah, and has been cited by reviewers as a pioneering work, because it was one of the first true crime books to focus on the victims of a violent crime rather than on the perpetrators. Light Years: An Investigation into the Extraterrestrial Experiences of Eduard Meier -- a comprehensive investigation of Billy Meier, a Swiss farmer's claims he was contacted by extraterrestrials -- was first serialized in Playboy. Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea addresses the story of the sidewheel steamer SS Central America, sometimes called the \\"Ship of Gold,\\" which sank in 1857 during a hurricane off the Carolina coast, and in the 1980s became the object of a feverish hunt by treasure seekers. Since 1988, Kinder has taught legal writing to lawyers and judges throughout the United States. He has worked as a consultant, delivering seminars on legal writing at law firms and corporate legal departments. Kinder has also created popular training programs for the American Bar Association.

The turkey emerges from the \\"House of Seven Gobbles\\" (a literal black market in disguise) and, seeing an easy mark and speaking in an impersonation of Jimmy Durante, offers himself to the pilgrim, only to use this as the start of a series of rapid-fire gags that stretch the limits of even cartoon physics, with the turkey consistently getting the best of his increasingly befuddled and frustrated opponent. Eventually the two make up and decide to \\"eat at Joe's,\\" following the advice of a clapboard-wearing bear advertising his steakhouse that appears throughout the short.

By this time my husband was fully dressed, and we could hear the noise of feet tramping on the deck overhead. He was quite calm and cheerful and helped me put the lifebelts on the children and on my maid. I was paralyzed with fear of not all getting on deck together in time, as there were seven of us. I would not let my younger daughter, [Emily], dress, but she only put on a fur coat, as I did over her nightgown.\\" Emily and her family went to 'A' deck and stood there for \\"fully half an hour\\". She, Suzette, Emily, Victorine and Grace stepped into Lifeboat 4. John was initially not allowed in, however, Arthur stepped forward and said, \\"Of course, that boy goes with his mother. He is only 13.\\" While in the lifeboat, Emily witnessed the ship break in half. They were rescued by at about 8 am on the 15th.

History  Like the Princely Counts of G√∂rz and the Princely Counts of Tyrol, the Graben family descended from the Meinhardins. The earliest known members of the Graben family, Konrad and his brother Grimoald von Graben, lived around 1170. Konrad's father may have been a son of Count palatine Engelbert I or his younger brother Count palatine Meinhard I of Gorizia.Johann Weichard Freiherr von Valvasor: Die Ehre dess Hertzogthums Crain: das ist, Wahre, gr√ºndliche, und recht eigendliche Belegen- und Beschaffenheit dieses R√∂misch-Keyserlichen herrlichen Erblandes; Laybach (Ljubljana) 1689Adalbert Sikora: Die Herren vom Graben in Zeitschrift des historischen Vereines f√ºr Steiermark. 51.

The first prominent member of the family was Ulrich II von Graben (named between 1314‚Äì1361), who was elevated to the Styrian title of Burggraf of Hohenwang. After the death of Leonhard of Gorizia in 1500, they became his successors as stadtholders of Lienz and East Tyrol. The last member was Felix Jakob von Graben; the family died out in 1776. The Dutch family De Graeff claimed descent from Wolfgang von Graben, a member of the Graben family. Andries de Graeff and his son Cornelis became Free Imperial knights of the Holy Roman Empire. That diploma dates from 19 July 1677.

He became the tribe's chief around 1880, after the death of his father, and secured the Tlokwa's status as the \\"smallest independent tribal unit\\" in the Bechuanaland Protectorate. He gave his name to the city of Gaborone, Botswana's current capital. Early life and family Gaborone's exact year of birth is unknown, but 1825 has been suggested as a likely date. His father was Matlapeng, who was the youngest of the four sons of Chief Kgosi, and his designated heir. He is the great grandson of Bogatsu. Upon Kgosi's death, Matlapeng was too young to succeed, and his older brother Lesage acted as chief in his place, subsequently leading the Tlokwa into an alliance with Sebetwane (the leader of the Makololo). However, Basha (one of Matlapeng's other brothers) was dissatisfied with Lesage's leadership, and the Tlokwa split into two groups. The first, led by Lesage, travelled north with Sebetwane to the Zambezi River, while the second, led by Basha, travelled south to Letlhakeng (now located in Kweneng District). Matlapeng sided with Basha, and Letlhakeng consequently became the birthplace of Gaborone, his first son. Matlapeng succeeded Basha as chief of the Tlokwa in 1835, and moved the tribe's village to Lepalong. Fearing attacks from the Boers and the Matabele, they relocated two years later to Thaba Ntsho. However, they were soon subjected to a Boer attack, and the survivors fled back to Letlhakeng. Matlapeng subsequently allied the Tlokwa with the Kwena tribe (led by Setshele), and his people moved to the Kwena capital, Molepolole. However, Setshele soon accused the Tlokwa of cowardice in a battle against the Ngwato, and Matlapeng ended the alliance (on non-violent terms) and led his people to Tshwene-Tshwene (near Vleischfontein in present-day South Africa). In 1875, the Tlokwa and the Kgatla combined to attack the Kwena at Molepolole, but were driven. Gaborone himself was responsible for rescue of the Kgatla chief, Lentswe, who had been abandoned by his fleeing tribesmen. Chiefdom Matlapeng died around 1880, and Gaborone, who was \\"already over sixty years of age\\", succeeded him as kgosi. Four years after his accession to the chiefdom, three of his brothers left the tribe to make their own ways in the world, although this was not an unusual occurrence amongst the Tswana. Around the same time as his brothers left, Gaborone moved the tribe to what is now called Tlokweng, on the Notwane River. That land fell within the nominal territory of the Kwena, but Gaborone erased the previous ill-will between the tribes by sending Setshele a gift of money and cattle. In 1895, Setshele's successor, Sebele, surrendered a strip of his land to the British, to be used for the construction of a railway by the British South Africa Company (BSAC). The land surrendered included Tlokweng. Rather than see their aging chief lose his land, the rest of the tribe determined that they would instead rent the land from the company until his death, at a rate of ¬£150 per year. The company agreed that \\"the old chief should not be disturbed in his lifetime\\". Gaborone eventually died in 1931, at the estimated age of 106. He was succeeded by his grandson, his eldest son having predeceased him. Legacy After Gaborone's death, the Bechuanaland Protectorate negotiated the return of the Tlokwa land from the BSAC, and created the Batlokwa Reserve. From the 1890s, Tlokweng had become known to British settlers as simply \\"Gaborone's Village\\", and the area on the opposite (western) bank to Tlokweng was given the name \\"Gaborone's Block\\". The name subsequently spread to the administrative headquarters of the area, and was corrupted from \\"Gaborone's\\" to \\"Gaberones\\". The town which developed retained the name \\"Gaberones\\" until 1969, when it was changed to Gaborone. Three years earlier, it had become the capital of the newly independent country of Botswana.

The French were boosted by the fact that a large part of the Allied army was forced to return to Britain where a Jacobite Rising of 1745 had broken out and Bonnie Prince Charlie had won a stunning victory at the Battle of Prestonpans. This left very few troops to actively oppose the French forces.Brumwell 2007, p. 57‚Äì58. After the French made two breaches in the walls of Brussels, the Austrian defenders were compelled to surrender on 22 February in a siege that lasted just three weeks. The governor of the Austrian Netherlands, Count Kaunitz, was forced to withdraw his administration north to Antwerp. The siege severely damaged his view of Austria's allies, principally Britain and the Dutch Republic, who he considered had done virtually nothing to protect Brussels from the French. A decade later Kaunitz would be one of the architects of the Franco-Austrian Alliance in which Austria abandoned its former alliance with Britain and joined with its traditional enemy France. The French followed up the capture of Brussels by taking other key cities and fortresses in the Austrian Netherlands including Mons and Namur. Brussels remained under French occupation until it was returned to Austria by the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle along with the rest of the Austrian Netherlands, although it was January 1749 before the French finally evacuated the city.Browning 1994, p.362‚Äì363.

Both members began wrestling as single competitors in 1983 in their backyard wrestling promotion Tag Team Wrestling, later renamed National All-Star Wrestling. The two later competed in various independent promotions in Michigan from 1990 to 1997 before making an appearance in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as Insane Clown Posse. The team later wrestled for World Wrestling Federation (WWF) with The Oddities, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) with The Dead Pool and The Dark Carnival, NWA Total Nonstop Action, and Juggalo Championship Wrestling. Insane Clown Posse are two-time JCW Tag Team Champions. Bruce is a one-time JCW Tag Team Champion with 2 Tuff Tony, and Utsler is a one-time JCW Heavyweight Champion. Bruce and Utsler are founding members of the Juggalo World Order. History =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997)= In August 1997, Bruce received a telephone call from friends Rob Van Dam and Sabu. They asked if he and Utsler could appear on Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW)'s second pay-per-view (PPV) program, Hardcore Heaven. Bruce and Utsler were already fans of ECW, as Van Dam had been sending videotapes of the show to them since its first airing. They agreed to appear and went to Florida to discuss the ECW program's content with Van Dam, Sabu, and Paul Heyman. Heyman was pleased that Bruce and Utsler were former wrestlers, which meant that they could surprise the crowd by taking bumps. Heyman also favored the idea of using Insane Clown Posse, because it was unlikely that anyone knew of the relationship the group had with Van Dam and Sabu. Heyman presented his idea to Bruce and Utsler, who agreed to participate. Insane Clown Posse opened the ECW program by performing songs and exciting the crowd. Then Van Dam and Sabu, the main villains at the time, attacked Bruce and Utsler. The top fan favorite, The Sandman, came in and saved them by chasing away Van Dam and Sabu with his signature Singapore cane. =ICP's Strangle-Mania Live (1997)= Being avid wrestling fans, Bruce and Utsler owned, and were fascinated by, the death match wrestling collection Outrageously Violent Wrestling from Japan. The duo decided to create a compilation of their favorite matches, recording their own commentary under the personas of \\"Handsome\\" Harley Guestella a.k.a. 'Gweedo' (Utsler) and Diamond Donovan Douglas a.k.a. '3D' (Bruce). The compilation video was released nationwide under the title ICP's Strangle-Mania. The video's success allowed Bruce and Utsler to host their own wrestling show, ICP's Strangle- Mania Live, to a sold-out performance at St. Andrew's Hall. The main event featured Insane Clown Posse versus The Chicken Boys, who were played by two friends of Bruce and Utsler. With local wrestling booker Dan Curtis, other wrestlers such as Mad Man Pondo, 2 Tuff Tony, Corporal Robinson, King Kong Bundy, and Abdullah the Butcher were also booked on the show to wrestle in the same death match style seen in Strangle-Mania. =World Wrestling Federation (1998)= In the summer of 1998, Insane Clown Posse received a telephone call from Jim Johnston of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The WWF heard that Bruce and Utsler were fans of wrestling and asked them to perform the entrance theme for the wrestling group Oddities. The WWF also wanted Bruce and Utsler to appear on their SummerSlam pay-per-view (PPV) program in August 1998 and rap live while The Oddities entered the ring. Insane Clown Posse composed the song \\"The Greatest Show\\" and agreed to appear on the program. Once the duo arrived at the arena, they realized their wrestling dreams had come true; they had been contacted by wrestling's top company and were now set to appear on their PPV program at the company's most historic venue, Madison Square Garden. Bruce and Utsler met backstage with various wrestlers, including the owner of the WWF, Vince McMahon, and his son, Shane McMahon. Bruce and Utsler paid Mick Foley, a wrestler with the WWF, his royalty payments from the ICP Strangle- Mania DVD, as Foley appeared in almost every match, and a friendship began among the three. Bruce and Utsler were assigned to the locker room with Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker, who were to wrestle during the main event that night. The duo immediately felt the animosity of the locker room that had previously driven them away from wrestling. Insane Clown Posse performed and were asked to return on September 1, 1998 for a television taping, where they accompanied wrestler Kurrgan in a taped match against Eric Sbraccia, which aired on the September 12 edition of Shotgun Saturday Night.\\"The History of WWE 1998\\", Website At the broadcast, Bruce and Utsler requested for more than just a rapping role; they wanted to wrestle. McMahon favored the idea and allowed them to participate. Insane Clown Posse was put in a feud with The Headbangers. In the first wrestling match, The Headbangers were stiff, throwing real punches and kicks. In the rematch, a move was planned where The Headbangers would be flipped over by Bruce and Utsler. When the time came to flip over, however, The Headbangers refused to move, forcing Insane Clown Posse to genuinely flip them over and begin throwing punches. Realizing that the match was getting too heated, McMahon ended the feud after that match. Bruce and Utsler were put into other matches along with The Oddities. Vince Russo told Bruce and Utsler to \\"make it seem like you don't know anything about wrestling, and you guys keep choking and digging into their eyes\\". During this time, Bruce and Utsler had no contract with WWF. They, however, did have an agreement that the WWF would occasionally play Insane Clown Posse commercials, and in return, Bruce and Utsler would wrestle for free. Bruce and Utsler knew that airtime cost significantly more than any monetary compensation they would receive and were thus satisfied with the agreement. Bruce and Utsler were told they were to suddenly turn on The Oddities in their match against The Headbangers, then join them in beating up the group. They were also informed that their commercial would air the very next week, which had still not aired after three months of being involved with the WWF. The following week, on the live November 30 Raw is War episode, the Insane Clown Posse and The Headbangers had a run-in with Stone Cold Steve Austin. Prior to the show, Austin had indicated to Bruce and Thrasher that Thrasher would receive the first Stone Cold Stunner, after which Bruce would turn around and receive the second. During the televised segment, Austin was shown making his way to the ring carrying a shovel. Once in the ring, Austin hit the Stunner on Bruce first (catching him off guard), then Thrasher. Although disappointed over the events during the match, Bruce and Utsler continued in hopes that McMahon would air the commercial as promised. Bruce and Utsler contacted Abbiss to inquire about the commercial and were informed that it was not aired. Given that McMahon failed to uphold his promise to air Insane Clown Posse's commercial, Abbiss recommended that Bruce and Utsler terminate their agreement with the WWF. =Hellfire Wrestling (1998)= While involved with the WWF, Insane Clown Posse brought Dan Curtis with them. After leaving the WWF, Curtis suggested that Insane Clown Posse start its own promotion while continuing with their music. He came to Bruce's house each night to discuss ideas about the promotion. Curtis convinced Bruce to coordinate another Strangle-Mania Live show, to be followed by an eighty-city \\"Hellfire Wrestling\\" tour. Curtis booked the talent and wrote the scripts. Strangle-Mania Live sold out the Majestic Theater in Detroit. Two days after the show, Curtis was found dead in his apartment, due to a sudden diabetic problem. The \\"Hellfire Wrestling\\" tour was subsequently canceled. =World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2000)= Insane Clown Posse went on to wrestle a long stint in World Championship Wrestling, starting in 1999. The duo formed two stables. The first stable, The Dead Pool, consisted of Insane Clown Posse, Vampiro, and Raven; the second consisted of Insane Clown Posse, Vampiro, Great Muta, and Kiss Demon, known as The Dark Carnival. On August 9, 1999, Insane Clown Posse made their WCW debut on Monday Nitro in a six-man tag team match. Insane Clown Posse and Vampiro defeated Lash LeRoux, Norman Smiley, and Prince Iaukea. At Road Wild 1999, Rey Mysterio, Jr., Billy Kidman, and Eddie Guerrero defeated Vampiro. Insane Clown Posse continued to wrestle on Monday Nitro, defeating Public Enemy one week, and losing to Konnan and Rey Mysterio, Jr. another. At Fall Brawl 1999, the tag team of Rey Mysterio, Eddie Guerrero, and Billy Kidman again defeated Vampiro and Insane Clown Posse. On September 13, Insane Clown Posse defeated Lenny Lane and Lodi. On the August 23, 2000 episode of Thunder, Great Muta, Vampiro, and Insane Clown Posse beat Tank Abbott and 3 Count. Five days later, on Nitro, Insane Clown Posse and Vampiro defeated 3 Count, and the following week, Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Juventud Guerrera beat Insane Clown Posse. On September 25, Mike Awesome defeated Insane Clown Posse in a Handicap Hardcore match after Awesome-Bombing Shaggy 2 Dope onto the roof of Awesome's bus. The slippery metal surface of the bus lead to Shaggy slipping and falling many feet onto the concrete floor. =Juggalo Championship Wrestling (1999-present)= On December 19, 1999, Bruce and Utsler created their own wrestling promotion, Juggalo Championshit Wrestling (now known as Juggalo Championship Wrestling). That night, the duo defeated the team of two Doink the Clowns to become the first ever JCW Tag Team Champions. The event was taped and released as JCW, Volume 1. Commentary was provided by Bruce and Utsler under their '3D' and 'Gweedo' announcing personas. In 2000, Insane Clown Posse and Evil Dead defeated The Rainbow Coalition, and the match was featured on JCW, Volume 2. In 2003, Insane Clown Posse defended, and retained, their JCW Tag Team Championships against Kid Cock (a parody of Kid Rock) and Feminem (a parody of Eminem). The match was featured on JCW, Volume 3. In 2007, JCW launched SlamTV!. With it came the first broadcast of JCW since the three initial DVDs. Bruce returned to commentary as Diamond Donovan Douglas, and Utsler returned as \\"Handsome\\" Harley Guestella. 3D and Gweedo announced in an episode of SlamTV! that Insane Clown Posse had been stripped of the JCW Tag Team Championships due to them not defending the title. At the first annual Bloodymania, JCW's premier wrestling event, Insane Clown Posse teamed with Sabu to defeat Trent Acid and The Young Alter Boys w/ Annie Social the Nun. In late 2007, Insane Clown Posse formed the stable Juggalo World Order (JWO). On November 9, the Juggalo World Order (Scott Hall, 2 Dope, Violent J, 2 Tuff Tony, and Corporal Robinson) \\"invaded\\" Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's Turning Point PPV by purchasing front row tickets to the event. They proceeded to promote their group by flashing their jerseys before being removed from the building. The group expressed interest in \\"invading\\" WWE at its 2009 Royal Rumble PPV, but were unable due to filming commitments for Big Money Rustlas. At Bloodymania III, Juggalo World Order (Robinson, Hall, 2 Dope, Violent J, and Sid Vicious) defeated the team of Trent Acid and the Alter Boys (Tim, Tom, Terry, and Todd). =Independent circuit= On March 17, 2000, Insane Clown Posse wrestled in Mid American Wrestling and defeated Big Flame, Neal, and Bob in a Handicap match. The following year, on 2001, Bruce appeared in Xtreme Pro Wrestling at XPW Rapture to aid Utsler. After Bruce suffered a real-life injury from a sloppy clothesline, the duo left the company. On October 5, 2002, Insane Clown Posse wrestled in Ring of Honor and defeated Oman Tortuga and Diablo Santiago. Both members of the team were later made playable characters in both Eidos Interactive's video games Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home and Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood. To help promote the games, they competed in a series of matches for Backyard Wrestling in 2003 and 2004. On December 12, 2004, the duo competed in the event A Night of Appreciation for Sabu, teaming with the Rude Boy to defeat the team of Corporal Robinson, Zach Gowen, and Breyer Wellington. In 2005, Utsler had neck surgery that left him unable to fully compete for two years. In late 2006, the duo was involved in a rivalry with the promotion Pro Wrestling Unplugged. They appeared at the company's event \\"PWU vs JCW\\" and attacked the tag team The O‚ÄôDoyles. At the following event, Utsler managed Team JCW (Nosawa, 2 Tuff Tony, Violent J, Mad Man Pondo, and Raven) in a War Games match against Team PWU (Trent Acid, Corporal Robinson, Johnny Kashmere, Pete Hunter, and Gary Wolfe) with manager Tod Gordon. Since Utsler fully recovered from his neck surgery in 2007, Insane Clown Posse has continued to appear at various promotions in the independent circuit. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004)= On January 21, 2004, Insane Clown Posse appeared on an episode of the weekly NWA Total Nonstop Action PPV. The duo were shown partying in the crowd alongside the juggalos in attendance. In the main event of the night, which featured Jeff Jarrett going against El Leon, Jarrett and El Leon were fighting in the crowd when Insane Clown Posse sprayed Faygo in Jarrett's eyes. The following week, Insane Clown Posse were interviewed in the ring by Mike Tenay. The duo explained that they were fans of TNA, and that they wanted to be a part of the promotion themselves. As they started making (kayfabe) negative remarks toward Jeff Jarrett, Glenn Gilberti and David Young interrupted. When Gilberti tried to convince the duo to apologize to Jarrett, Insane Clown Posse chased Gilbertti and Young out of the ring before challenging the team to a match for the next week. On February 4, Insane Clown Posse defeated Glen Gilbertti and David Young. Later that night, Scott Hudson interviewed Insane Clown Posse, and the duo announced that they would face whoever Jeff Jarrett threw at them next in a \\"Juggalo Street Fight\\". Insane Clown Posse won against the team of Glen Gilbertti and Kid Kash on February 18. Two weeks later, Insane Clown Posse announced that they would take part in a \\"Dark Carnival Match\\" the next week against Glen Gilbertti and any partner he chooses. The following week, Insane Clown Posse and 2 Tuff Tony took on Glen Gilbertti, Kid Kash, and David Young. \\"The Alpha Male\\" Monty Brown made his TNA return, and cost Insane Clown Posse and 2 Tuff Tony the match. During their stint in TNA, Insane Clown Posse brought the company its largest paying crowds in history. After the duo left, they remained close with the company. On March 17, 2006, Insane Clown Posse hosted and booked TNA's first ever house show, which took place in Detroit, Michigan. The duo defeated Team Canada members Eric Young and Petey Williams.

Jerome O'Hara and George Perez (S.D.N.Y., No. 09-mag-2484) is a federal court case for the ongoing trial of Jerome O'Hara and George Perez, two computer programmers who previously worked for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BLMIS) until the arrest of the company's chairman, Bernard Madoff, on December 11, 2008. The order to issue arrest warrants for O'Hara and Perez was signed on November 12, 2009 by federal magistrate judge Debra C. Freeman. The next morning, FBI agents arrested O'Hara at his home in Malverne, New York and Perez at his home in East Brunswick, New Jersey, and charged them each with conspiracy to falsify books and records, falsifying books and records of a broker‚Äìdealer, and falsifying books and records of an investment advisor (IA). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also served them with civil charges. At their bail hearing, federal prosecutor Preet Bharara said: \\"The computer codes and random algorithms they allegedly designed served to deceive investors and regulators and concealed Madoff's crimes.\\" The attorney for O'Hara, Gordon Mehler, said \\"We intend to enter a plea of not guilty\\", and the attorney for Perez, Larry Krantz, declined to comment. Federal magistrate judge Ronald L. Ellis set the bail at $1 million with travel restrictions.  Background  O'Hara and Perez began working for BLMIS in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Prosecutors claim that in April 2006, the two men tried to delete 218 computer programs from an IBM server known internally as \\"House 17\\". According to the SEC, the programs, among other things, outputted volumes of fake trade blotters, stock records, Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) reports and other phantom books and records to substantiate nonexistent trading. The filenames containing the programs were often prefixed with \\"SPCL\\", which stood for \\"special\\". The FBI and SEC said that later in August or September 2006, O'Hara and Perez withdrew hundreds of thousands of dollars from their personal BLMIS accounts before informing Madoff that they no longer wished to lie for him. = The Ponzi scheme = According to the FBI, from at least as early as the 1980s through to December 11, 2008, Madoff, Frank DiPascali, and others perpetrated a scheme to defraud clients of the BLMIS IA corporation by accepting billions of dollars of clients' funds under false pretenses, promising to invest the funds for the clients. Instead, they failed to invest the funds and created and distributed false documents that purported to show that the funds had been invested, when they hadn't. Allegedly, they also lied to the SEC and an accounting firm to cover up the fraudulent scheme. Madoff solicited, and caused others to solicit, prospective clients to open accounts with BLMIS by, among other things, promising to invest funds in common stock, options, and other securities in a way that would achieve high rates of return with little risk. They managed to establish thousands of accounts with BLMIS, representing individual investors, charities, trusts, pension funds, hedge funds, and corporations. = \\"Split Strike\\" strategy = DiPascali, under the direction of Madoff, created a purported investment strategy that was referred to as a \\"split strike conversion\\" (\\"Split Strike\\") strategy, and marketed this to clients beginning in or around the early 1990s. Clients whose funds were to be managed within the strategy were promised that: # Their funds would be invested in a pool of around 35‚Äì50 common stocks from the Standard & Poor's 100 Index (S&P; 100) # The collection of stocks would mimic the price movements of the Index # The investments would be hedged by buying contracts related to those stocks, thereby limiting potential losses from unexpected changes in stock prices # Madoff would appropriately time the entry and removal of funds in this investment strategy # Funds that were not invested in stocks would be invested in money market funds and U.S.-issued securities such as U.S. Treasury bills. Thousands of BLMIS clients were told that their funds, collectively worth billions, were invested within the Split Strike strategy. Allegedly, Madoff and others created statements for the \\"Split Strike clients\\" that listed stocks in which their funds were supposedly invested. The reports falsely made it appear that the returns were approximately 10 to 17 percent per year. Allegedly, DiPascali and others, in order to conceal the falsehood of the strategy, prepared several, model baskets of S&P; 100 stocks, and tracked how these hypothetical baskets would have performed in the actual marketplace to determine what the clients would be told regarding when their funds had \\"entered the market\\". Data related to chosen baskets of securities would be entered into an IBM AS/400 server known as \\"House 17\\", which was dedicated primarily to the IA business. Madoff, DiPascali, and others used computer programs that were allegedly written by O'Hara and Perez to allocate pro rata multiples of the chosen basket, based on clients' purported account balances with BLMIS. These programs would output thousands of pages of fake documents that purported to confirm the purchase of stocks from the chosen basket. A similar process was used when funds were \\"removed from the market\\". Because none of the purchases had actually occurred, Madoff, DiPascali, and others would allegedly price each stock at some chosen price from the range of prices which the stock was selling for on the day that the stocks were supposedly purchased. They supposedly chose a price that would make the trades, if they had actually happened, most favorable, but still making sure that the volume of trades of the stock on the day of the \\"trade\\" was sufficiently high as to not cause suspicion. Allegedly, Madoff, DiPascali, and others oversaw the production and mailing of thousands of pages of account \\"statements\\" each month, which all falsely reflected securities transactions that had not occurred. According to the FBI, they would also routinely add lines representing additional, fictitious option trades for the purpose of making it appear that the accounts had achieved the targeted rate of return. = \\"Non-Split Strike clients\\" = At all times during the fraud, BLMIS had a number of clients who were not invested within the Split Strike strategy (\\"Non-Split Strike clients\\"). The non-Split Strike clients were told that their funds would be invested using strategies that would realize annual rates of return from at least 53 percent. From at least the early 1980s, Madoff and others allegedly took steps to make it appear as though their funds had generated these extraordinarily high returns, when, in fact, their funds had not been invested at all. = \\"House 05\\" and Stratus systems = The operations of the \\"Market Making\\" and \\"Proprietary Trading\\" businesses of BLMIS principally relied on two computer systems: a Stratus trading platform, and an IBM AS/400 server that was internally known as \\"House 05\\". The Stratus system was responsible for, among other things, effectuating the trading activities of BLMIS, and it communicated with third parties in connection with trades, in particular, by communicating with trading contra parties. Data was regularly transferred from the Stratus system to House 05. Allegedly, O'Hara and Perez were very familiar with the back-end workings of the House 05 system, and, among other things, they wrote programs for House 05 that would: # Process data generated by the Stratus system # Enable communication with third parties including the Depository Trust Company # Obtain data from these third parties to be used in creating books and records # Assist BLMIS employees in finding discrepancies between the House 05 and Stratus systems by generating \\"break sheets\\". According to the FBI, O'Hara and Perez were also responsible for maintaining House 05. = \\"House 17\\" = Another IBM AS/400 server, known internally as \\"House 17\\", was the principal computer system of the IA business. Unlike House 05, House 17 did not electronically receive trading data from third parties. Allegedly, all data on the House 17 system was generated by DiPascali and others in the IA business, who entered it into the House 17 server. The FBI examined backup tapes and used testimony of DiPascali to conclude that O'Hara and Perez developed and maintained computer programs on the House 17 server that were used expressly for the purpose of entering fictitious trading data into the server. FBI agents claim that the House 17 computer programs were used to generate, among other things, thousands of pages of fake account statements, trade confirmations, trading blotters, and other books and records related to BLMIS's purported IA business.  Charges  The United States formally charged O'Hara and Perez with: * Count One ‚Äì Conspiracy to Falsify Books and Records of a Broker‚ÄìDealer and to Falsify Books and Records of an Investment Advisor * Count Two ‚Äì Falsifying Books and Records of a Broker‚ÄìDealer * Count Three ‚Äì Falsifying Books and Records of an Investment Advisor  References  Ongoing legal cases United States District Court for the Southern District of New York cases Great Recession United States District Court case articles without infoboxes ","title":"United States v.

The brick depot and rotary converter \\"substation\\" was built in 1909 and designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. The station served regularly scheduled electric interurban passenger trains and electric locomotive powered freight trains. The Illinois Power and Light Company also used the building as an electrical substation from 1927 until 1955. Very high voltage alternating current was converted to 600 volt direct current for use by the interurban line's locomotives and interurban cars. Wires entered and left through the large holes in the upper portions of the depot. The station was one of several properties owned by the IT at Mackinaw along with adjacent mainline track and a number of rail sidings, but the other buildings and the track have since been demolished leaving the depot as the only surviving landmark from the era of electric interurban trolley service in the central Illinois area. The depot was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1978.

It is the fourth film by Sherwood Pictures, the creators of Flywheel, Facing the Giants, and Fireproof. Filming in Albany, Georgia concluded in June 2010. The film was marketed by Sony's Provident Films, which also marketed their previous films. The film was directed by Alex Kendrick, who co-wrote its screenplay with his brother Stephen Kendrick. Alex Kendrick also stars in the film, along with Ken Bevel and Kevin Downes. About half of the cast and crew were volunteers from Sherwood Baptist Church, while the remainder were brought on through invitation-only auditions. The film was produced with a budget of $2 million, but on its opening weekend, it grossed $2 million in pre-sales alone and grossed $9.1 million total for the weekend. It grossed a total of $35.2 million, over 17 times its budget. The film opened to generally negative reviews from secular critics and generally positive reviews from Christian critics. Plot In 2011, when his truck is stolen at a gas station, Nathan Hayes (Ken Bevel) chases it and manages to reclaim the truck but the criminal gets away. Though he is injured, he crawls back to his truck, and sees that his little baby boy in the back is okay. When the police arrive, sheriff's deputies Adam Mitchell and Shane Fuller (Alex Kendrick and Kevin Downes) meet Hayes, discovering he is a new deputy, having recently moved to Albany, Georgia. The personal lives of these officers are observed: Mitchell adores his nine-year-old daughter, Emily (Lauren Etchells), but is distant from his fifteen-year-old son, Dylan (Rusty Martin), because he doesn't share his son's interest in running. Hayes never knew his biological father, instead treating a neighbor as his father (even giving him Father's Day cards annually), but would risk his life to save his three children. His teenage daughter, Jade (Taylor Hutcherson), resents him because he has a strict policy about dating, and won't let her go out with her love interest Derrick (Donald Howze). Fuller is divorced, as were his parents, and has joint custody of his son. Their youngest deputy, David Thomson (Ben Davies) is young and single. Javier Martinez (Robert Amaya) is an immigrant struggling to provide for his family after being laid off when a construction company went over budget. While job hunting, he walks down an alley asking God what He wants him to do. Mitchell, thinking he is a different Javier recommended to him by a friend, calls him over to help with backyard projects and construction. After paying him for the job, Mitchell recommends him to a new full-time job, where he is hired. One day, Emily is killed by a drunk driver, devastating Mitchell and his family. Following his daughter's death, Mitchell reads about fatherhood in the Bible. He decides he must be a better father and crafts a detailed \\"Resolution\\" to honor God in every aspect of his family. Mitchell, Hayes, Fuller, Thomson, and Martinez join him in his resolution at a formal ceremony conducted by Hayes's neighborhood mentor, the man he thinks of as a father. As a result of the resolution, Mitchell and Fuller mend their relationships with their sons, Hayes with his daughter, and he also visits the grave of his biological father whom he had never met and forgives him. Thomson reveals that he fathered a child in college and deserted the mother after she refused to have an abortion. He writes the mother and seeks to mend their relationship and to see his child, after seeing that abandoning kids contributes to crime on the streets, and does not want that burden on her. Martinez's manager offers him a promotion on the condition that he falsify inventory documents. After being given a day to think about it, Martinez refuses, maintaining that it would be wrong. Impressed, his boss promotes him and raises his pay, revealing that the condition had been a test of Javier's integrity, with Javier being the only individual to pass after many others had been tested. Mitchell discovers that Fuller has been stealing drugs from police evidence to resell on the streets, drugs that could have ended up inside the drunk driver who killed his daughter. Mitchell decides that he must honor his Resolution and report the corruption. He sets up a sting leading to Fuller's arrest and imprisonment. Fuller explains that he was doing it for his son, feeling that his yearly pay wasn't enough to provide for him. Mitchell visits Fuller in jail, where Fuller admits to his mistakes and asks Mitchell to look after his son. During a minor traffic stop, Hayes and Thomson unknowingly confront the armed leader of a gang they have been repeatedly encountering. One of the gang members is Derrick, who stops T.J. (Tony 'T.C.' Stallings), the gang leader and the individual who tried to steal Hayes‚Äô truck at the beginning, from shooting Hayes. After an intense firefight, Deputy Hayes asks Derrick what he's doing with the gang, and the latter responds that he had no one else that cared about him, and never had a father. At a Father's Day church service, the men present the Resolution and Mitchell urges the fathers in the congregation to be a godly influence on their families. Mitchell runs a 5K race with both his and Fuller's sons, Hayes begins to teach and mentor Derrick in prison, and Thomson meets his daughter for the first time.

Sherwood Pictures stated that \\"After much prayer, creative brainstorming, more prayer, wise counsel, and still more prayer, Sherwood Pictures is ready to move ahead with their fourth motion picture.\\" Before the announcement, the filmmakers launched TheNextSherwoodMovie.com, which contained teasers for Courageous. At the time of the announcement, the Kendrick brothers stated that they had completed \\"about 80 percent of the plot\\", and they had planned to finish the script by the end of 2009. =Casting= In preceding Sherwood Pictures films, almost all of the cast and crew were composed of members of Sherwood Baptist Church, with Kirk Cameron being the notable exception with his lead role in Fireproof. For Courageous the producers expanded their search for acting talent. Roughly half of the cast are volunteers from the church, but the other half were through invitation-only audition sessions. The lead roles in the film are played by Alex Kendrick and Ken Bevel, both of whom have appeared in past Sherwood productions. Kevin Downes, who has appeared in various other films, played the role of Shane Fuller. Ben Davies, a student athlete at Samford University, played the role of David Thomson. Tony Stallings, former running back and winner of Animal Planet's King of the Jungle reality show, made his film debut. The actors were still volunteers. The film would likely have cost several times more if they had used professional assistance. Director Kendrick said, \\"With volunteers no one is watching the clock and we're all in it together.\\" =Filming= Principal photography of Courageous began on April 26, 2010 and concluded on June 25, 2010. The majority of the film was shot in Albany and the Dougherty County, Georgia area. Some scenes were shot in the Dougherty County Jail. Jon Erwin served as second unit director. More than 170 media outlets, such as Inside Edition, visited the set. The Duggar family from TLC's 19 Kids and Counting were extras during a father-son 5K race. Jim Bob Duggar and seven of his ten sons joined hundreds of other fathers and sons in filming the scene. Their involvement in the film was shown on 19 Kids and Counting in \\"Duggars go Hollywood\\". The Duggar daughters acted as extras in a funeral scene at Sherwood Baptist Church that involved several police officers in uniform. In order to enhance the quality of the film, the production crew is using a new camera technology, \\"Red One\\", by the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company. Kendrick estimated the production budget would exceed $1 million ‚Äî double that of Fireproof. The final budget has been reported at $2 million. Release =Rating= In December 2010, the Motion Picture Association of America rated the film PG-13 for \\"some violence and drug content\\". That rating was surrendered a few days later, but was later reinstated. Courageous is the first film by Sherwood Pictures to receive a PG-13 rating. =Marketing= The contemporary Christian band Casting Crowns released a song titled \\"Courageous\\" to promote the film with a video featuring scenes from it. Tony Dungy, a Super Bowl-winning football coach, mentioned the film in an article he wrote about fatherhood for USA Today. He said, \\"As men, we could all take a lesson from [the fathers in Courageous] and ask ourselves, 'What can I do today to be a more involved dad?'\\" =Box office= Courageous was released on September 30, 2011 to 1,161 theaters, grossing $3.1 million on its opening day and debuting in fourth place with an actual gross of $9,063,147 for the opening weekend, the best opening of all new films released that weekend. It sold over $2 million in pre-sale tickets, the most of the weekend on Fandango, beating out The Lion King 3D, Moneyball, Dolphin Tale, and Drive. After its opening weekend, Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"...Courageous is the real success story of the weekend...Courageous earned a strong $8.8 million, outdoing the $6.8 million opening of Sherwood's 2008 picture Fireproof, which became the highest-grossing independent film that year with $33.5 million total. Shown in 1,161 theaters (yet, notably, just one theater in Manhattan), Courageous earned the best per theater average of any wide release with a robust $7,580.\\" Courageous beat out all three Hollywood movies which opened on the same weekend: 50/50, What's Your Number?, and Dream House, which were produced with budgets of $8 million, $20 million, and $50 million, respectively. According to Box Office Mojo, its opening weekend ranks fifth all-time among Christian movies, behind The Passion of the Christ and the three Chronicles of Narnia films. As of December 11, 2011, the film has grossed $33,333,639, over 16 times its budget. After the Kendrick brothers' previous films were released to DVD following the theatrical run, the film started an international theatrical roll-out which began November 10 in Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand. The film debuted at #18 in Argentina, #16 in Australia and #21 in New Zealand, with weekend opening grosses of $19,536, $107,781, and $10,529 respectively. The film opened in Mexico on December 2, ranking 31st with a total of $6,911 from 15 screens. As of December 4, the international gross for the movie is $219,977. As of 2020 the film has grossed $34,522,221 domestically and $663,663 internationally with a worldwide total of $35,185,884. Becoming the Kendrick brother's highest grossing film until it got surpassed by War Room in 2015. =Critical reception= The film received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 33%, based on 21 reviews with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"While the filmmaking is fairly competent, Courageous is overall worthless to anybody who doesn't subscribe to its dogmatic agenda.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 42/100 based on 10 reviews, indicating \\"mixed to average reviews.\\" However, audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade on an A+ to F scale. Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film a mediocre review, saying \\"the film travels far beyond its dramatic climax, aiming for an altar call finale.\\" Kam Williams of NewsBlaze gave the film four stars, saying the film was a \\"moving, modern parable not to be missed by anyone who's always wondering why they don't make wholesome movies with uplifting messages anymore.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said Courageous demonstrated the Kendrick brothers' \\"growing expertise as filmmakers with its skillful blending of moving drama, subtle comedy and several impressive action sequences, including a well-staged foot chase and a harrowing shootout between the cops and bad guys.\\" Hannah Goodwyn of the Christian Broadcasting Network rated Courageous 3 out of 5, saying \\"Courageous' biblical message is clear and good. Unfortunately, its delivery is weakened by some rookie acting and excessive dialogue.\\" Adam R. Holz of Focus on the Family Plugged In Online said Courageous has \\"A compelling story line with plenty of action and just the right amount of humor. The Film underscores the importance of fatherhood...plus I like how it creatively weaves in the Gospel. I am happily giving Courageous 4.5 shiny badges out of 5 for family friendliness.\\" Alex Kendrick and Robert Amaya were nominated at the 20th Annual Movie Guide Awards under the category of Most Inspiring Performance in Movies in 2011, with Kendrick winning and the film was named the Most Inspiring Movie of 2011. =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 17, 2012 as an \\"Exclusive Collector's Edition\\", and was #1 in disc sales in the US the week ending January 22, 2012 according to The Hollywood Reporter.

When the sitting Member of Parliament (MP) for Swansea District, Sir Hussey Vivian, was elevated to the peerage in June 1893, Williams was elected unopposed in his place. He did not defend the seat at the next general election in 1895. His son, Thomas Jeremiah Williams, was elected as MP for the same constituency at a by- election in 1915. He died at his home, Maes y Gwernen Hall, Llangyfelach, in 1904, aged 64.

In electrical networks, a parasitic element is a circuit element (resistance, inductance or capacitance) that is possessed by an electrical component but which it is not desirable for it to have for its intended purpose. For instance, a resistor is designed to possess resistance, but will also possess unwanted parasitic capacitance. Parasitic elements are unavoidable. All conductors possess resistance and inductance and the principles of duality ensure that where there is inductance, there will also be capacitance. Component designers will strive to minimise parasitic elements but are unable to completely eliminate them. The most commonly seen manifestations of parasitic elements in components are in the parasitic inductance and resistance of the component leads and the parasitic capacitance of the component packaging. For wound components such as inductors and transformers, there is additionally the important effect of parasitic capacitance that exists between the individual turns of the windings. This winding parasitic capacitance will cause the inductor to act as a resonant circuit at some frequency, known as the self- resonant frequency, at which point (and all frequencies above) the component is useless as an inductor. Parasitic elements are often modelled as lumped components in equivalent circuits, but this is not always adequate. For instance, the inter-winding capacitance mentioned above is really a distributed element along the whole length of the winding and not a capacitor in one particular place. Designers sometimes take advantage of parasitic effects to achieve a desired function in a component, see for instance helical resonator. Nonlinear parasitic elements can also arise. The term is commonly used to describe parasitic structures formed on an integrated circuit whereby an unwanted semiconductor device is formed from p-n junctions which belong to two or more intended devices or functions.

The second film he produced, The Fast and the Furious and been bought for distribution by a newly formed company, American Releasing Corporation (ARC), headed by Sam Arkoff and James H. Nicholson. Corman had offers from other companies but said he chose ARC because the company were willing to forward him money in advance, which he could use to finance other films.Corman and Jerome 1990, p. 25. In October 1954 ARC announced that they would make three more films with Corman's company, Palo Alto, over the next twelve months, starting with Five Guns West in November. ARC later became the famous American International Pictures. Corman had directed second unit on Fast and the Furious and decided to direct Five Guns West himself. This was announced in November 1954.Seven Theaters Offer 'Sabrina' Los Angeles Times 24 Nov 1954: 14 Corman later said \\"the work by the directors on the two films I had produced was acceptable.

Campbell was paid $200 to write the script - it was his first screenplay - and was cast in a key role.Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 Prior to filming, Corman's directing experience was limited to doing second unit on Fast and the Furious and observing film sets on the lot at 20th Century Fox. In order to get some practice before starting Five Guns West, he shot an 8-minute short film on 16 mm over one day with some actor friends. Corman says he never bothered having this film processed and edited. He later wrote in his memoirs \\"if a young man came to me today with similar credentials there's no way I'd hire him. I'd tell him to go out and get more training.\\"Corman p 27 =Filming= Filming started 29 November 1954. The film was shot over nine days at Iverson's ranch in the San Fernando Valley near Chatsworth, and Ingram‚Äôs Ranch, owned by cowboy actor Jack Ingram, who had built a Western town there.Roger Corman & Jim Jerome, How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never lost a Dime, Muller, 1990 p 27 Corman bought stock footage of Indians to use in the film. He says he prepared thoroughly for the shoot with the assistance of Floyd Crosby and art director Ben Hayne. Corman says Hayne was particularly helpful being a western buff and would assist Corman in doing sketches for each shot. The director says he was comfortable working with the camera but less so with actors.Corman p 28 Corman says it rained the first day. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt possible,\\" he recalls thinking. \\"My first day! I hadn‚Äôt even started and I was already behind schedule! I got so worked up and tense that I pulled off the road and threw up. Then I just leaned against my car in the rain and pulled myself together. I made it to Iverson‚Äôs and after about an hour‚Äôs wait the rain stopped.‚ÄùCorman p 28 Corman said he was \\"very, very nervous\\" during the shoot. \\"I had been confident about my work as producer, but as soon as I made the transition to director, I became shaky. I was so nervous I couldn't eat lunch for the first five or six days. All could do was shoot in the morning and stare at the script and study it to find out what I was going to do in the afternoon.\\" The film marked the first time Corman worked with cinematographer Floyd Crosby, who would become one of the director's key collaborated. \\" ‚ÄúHe needed a lot less coaching than a lot of other young directors,\\" said Crosby. \\"He knew what he wanted, he worked fast, and it was fun. Suddenly we were a team.‚Äù Corman said Floyd \\"worked fast, which is important to me, and yet his stuff was always good. No matter how fast I moved, Floyd kept right up, and he could light a setup in 10‚Äì15 minutes flat, or even faster if need be, and we‚Äôd go. That‚Äôs unusual‚Äîlots of people are fast, but you don‚Äôt want to see the results. With Floyd, you didn‚Äôt have that problem. Plus, he knew how to set up these really complicated dolly shots quickly.

In order to complete Five Guns West Corman obtained funds from the budget of one of his upcoming projects, a science fiction film then called The Unseen (which became The Beast with a Million Eyes) . This meant that Corman would have to make the latter movie for less than $30,000. However Corman said Five Guns West \\"was a breakthrough for me. With almost no training or preparation whatsoever, I was literally learning how to direct on the job. It took me four or five of these training pictures to learn what a film school student knows when he graduates.\\"Corman p 27 Reception =Box Office= Before the film had even been released, ARC assigned Corman to another Western, Apache Woman. According to Corman both films made a profit.Corman p 30 Corman said the fact the film was in color helped put it in the top half of double bills through most of the US, although in some major cities in was a second feature. However the film struggled to recoup money because it often played on the bottom of double bills, which meant it received a flat fee instead of a percentage. Alex Gordon confirmed that saying \\"it soon became obvious that single B-pictures like these first three [Fast and Furious, Five Guns West, Apache Woman] would not work out for the new company‚Äî they played the bottom of twin- bill programming at $25 per booking. AIP would have to own both pictures to obtain percentage bookings.\\" This would prompt AIP to revert to making movies as a package to release as a double bill. In 1956 Jim Nicholson said ARC had to sell this film and Fast and the Furious to television because of \\"short finances\\" but that they would never do it again. =Critical= Picture Show called it \\"ably acted and directed\\".FIVE GUNS WEST (Anglo.

Almost all of his known games are wins against Anderssen, found in Eichborn's papers after his death. Based on the results of these games, an argument can be made for Eichborn being the best chess player ever, although this is highly unlikely to be an accurate evaluation. Life Eichborn was born and lived in Breslau, Germany (now called Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). As a wealthy banker and keen chess player, Eichborn found time to regularly play the best players in Breslau, most notably Adolf Anderssen. The best chess player ever? It appears that Eichborn recorded his best games against Anderssen (most of which were wins for Eichborn) in a notebook which was found after his death. The games were published in the book Adolf Anderssen, der Altmeister Schachspielkunst, by Gottschall in 1912. About 15 other Eichborn's games with other opponents, for example Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa whom he also beat, were published by Deutsche Schachzeitung during his lifetime. Chessgames.com records 34 games between Eichborn and Anderssen, the results of which were as follows: *1851-2: 9 wins, 1 draw, no losses *1853: 9 wins, no draws, 1 loss *1854-5: 6 wins, no draws, 1 loss *1857-9: 6 wins, no draws no losses *Total: 31 wins, 1 draw, 2 losses Other sources record 29 Eichborn wins with two incomplete games. If these results represented all of the games played between the two opponents, such a record against a player who was amongst the best in the world (amongst other victories, Anderssen won the first international chess tournament, held in London in 1851) is unprecedented. Although ratings were not calculated for players in the 1850s, it is possible (for example using a system similar to Chessmetrics) to calculate what Eichborn's rating would have been on the basis of these games. Comparing this calculation against that of other players through history leads to the conclusion that Eichborn is the best chess player of all time. For example, whilst Garry Kasparov's best rating was 2851, and Bobby Fischer's was 2785, Eichborn's performance against Anderssen would have given him a rating of almost 3000. However, these calculations are highly unlikely to be accurate, particularly because it is not known how many games in total he lost against Anderssen - it is speculated that there may have been many. It is also unclear whether these games were played at odds - based on Anderssen's play in the surviving games, it has been suggested that any drawn game counted as a win for Eichborn. Realistically, the lack of known games played by Eichborn makes it difficult to assess his playing strength, although it is clear from his surviving games that he was a strong player.

Arkoff said he expected his company to break even on Apache Woman only at the end of next year. Arkoff said this was because it was issued as a single feature and \\"a single feature usually gets played - and played down - as the second feature.\\" Arkoff added this \\"taught us a lesson\\" and ARC/AIP decided after Apache Woman that, instead of selling films individually, to sell them two at a time as a \\"package\\" to play on a double bill. They had a great success doing this with their first double bill, The Day the World Ended and Phantom from 10,000 Leagues which secured the future of the company.Shocker Pioneers Tell How to Make Monsters: Want to Make a Monster?

It was written by Jim Shooter, with art by Curt Swan and George Klein. The story arc includes the first appearance of the villainous Fatal Five. It is also notable for featuring the first \\"permanent\\" death of a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes.Lightning Lad was killed battling Zaryan the Conqueror in Adventure Comics #304 (January 1963), but was revived in issue #312 (September 1963). This particular story line has been lauded as being among the best young adult literature of 1967, ranking among (un-illustrated) novels like Taran Wanderer and The Outsiders. Plot At their headquarters in the 30th century, five members of the Legion of Super-Heroes watch a Science Police documentary on its most wanted villains, who have been dubbed the \\"Fatal Five\\": the Persuader, a paid assassin and enforcer whose Atomic Axe can slice any type of matter or energy; Tharok, a brilliant half-human/half-robotic criminal mastermind; the Emerald Empress, who seized control of the planet Vengar after stealing the mystical Emerald Eye of Ekron;Her home planet is spelled \\"Venegar\\" in subsequent stories. Validus, a powerful gigantic creature who projects mental lightning from his brain; and Mano, a mutant who destroyed his home planet Angtu with the energy that emanates from his right hand. Hours later, the Legionnaires receive word that \\"It\\" is approaching Earth. As Superboy explains to newer members Princess Projectra and Ferro Lad,Princess Projectra and Ferro Lad joined the Legion in Adventure Comics #346 (July 1966). \\"It\\" is a massive cloud-like object called the \\"Sun-Eater\\". Capable of completely devouring the energy from stars, thereby destroying all life in entire star systems, the Sun-Eater represents a major threat. Astronomers have determined that the Sun-Eater is on a direct course for Sol, Earth's sun. Short-handed and unable to recruit assistance from other heroes in the galaxy, the five Legionnaires decide to seek aid from the Fatal Five, who would also die if the Sun-Eater cannot be stopped. Cosmic Boy locates Tharok, who joins him after being promised a full pardon. Superboy rescues the Emerald Empress as she is about to be executed on the planet Craggok; she accompanies him, bringing a small chunk of green kryptonite with her. Sun Boy travels to Bismari and obtains Validus' release the day before his scheduled execution. On Jupiter's twelfth moon, Princess Projectra successfully recruits the Persuader. Ferro Lad rescues Mano just as the villain's right hand is about to be amputated in space (which would have resulted in his death). Mano launches a failed attempt to form an alliance with the Emerald Empress. She unsuccessfully tries to convince Superboy to help her conquer her home planet, even after using the kryptonite as a means of persuasion. Soon after, Tharok reveals his plan to destroy the Sun-Eater: Tharok will temporarily increase the powers of all the heroes and villains. Sun Boy will use his solar powers in open space to lure the cloud away from Sol. The Persuader will use his Atomic Axe to divide the Sun-Eater into eight smaller sections, and the others will destroy the individual pieces. Later, the five villains meet in secret and band together as a formal group, bent on conquering the galaxy. When the plan is implemented, seven of the heroes and villains manage to weaken the Sun-Eater, but fail to completely destroy any of the sections. Even Superboy fails when the Sun-Eater blasts him with red solar radiation. Ferro Lad tries to reach and destroy the cloud's core, but is rebuffed by an energy blast and does no damage to the cloud at all. The Sun- Eater reforms, prompting Tharok to construct an Absorbatron bomb, which can destroy the cloud if it is detonated at the core. Since Tharok had no time to build a propulsion device, one of them must carry the bomb to the core and detonate it manually ‚Äî an act which would result in that person's death. Superboy is about to take the bomb, citing he has the best chance to survive, but he is still weak from the red sun rays. Ferro Lad punches Superboy, grabs the bomb and speeds toward the cloud. Reaching the core, Ferro Lad detonates the bomb, destroying both the Sun-Eater and himself. The Legionnaires offer full pardons to the members of the Fatal Five, but they attack and quickly overcome the heroes. Tharok commands Validus to destroy them, but he refuses and turns on the villains. When Validus' mental lightning strikes the Persuader's Atomic Axe, the Fatal Five disappears. Later, the other Legionnaires return from their distant mission. Unable to recover Ferro Lad's remains, the team sends a missile in memoriam to him to the cemetery planet Shanghalla. The Legionnaires promise never to forget his sacrifice. Final Night In post-Zero Hour continuity, a faction of the Legion is stranded in the 20th century, and the Sun-Eater approaches Earth in that era. Andrew Nolan is among the Earth heroes native to that era. He attempts a suicide mission to destroy the Sun-Eater, but his life is saved by Parallax (Hal Jordan).Final Night #1-4 (November 1996) Later, he joins the Legion as Ferro,Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #93 (June 1997) and accompanies them when they finally discover a way to return to their own time.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #100 (January 1998) Post-Infinite Crisis In the aftermath of the Infinite Crisis miniseries, most of the Legion's original continuity has been restored.

Apache Woman and The Oklahoma Woman came from ideas of AIP, the others were based on ideas of Corman. The movie was made by Sunset Productions, one of independent production units that would make movies for ARC/AIP. Corman had his own unit, Paolo Alto, but worked for the other units as well. It was the first movie from Sunset; the second would be It Conquered the World, also directed by Corman. The movie was made for $60,000 in SuperScope. Corman said he \\"tried to create a bigger look than the budget might indicate and save time and money in the process.\\" He experimented shooting consecutively the components of multiple scenes that faced in one direction, then reversing the angle and shooting them all in the opposite direction. He said this made it easier for him to match backgrounds and wardrobe, \\"but it was too difficult for the actors and since then I've tended to shoot more in sequence.\\" It was the first of several collaborations between Corman and cinemtaographer Frederick E.

They soon encounter a giant dragon-like sea serpent which destroys their ship. They wash up ashore on the mysterious land of the Grimaults and are taken captive by its ruthless tyrant Stark (Richard Devon). The Viking women discover their men, led by Vedric (Brad Jackson), had earlier washed ashore and were now imprisoned by Stark to work in his mines. The women eventually escape, liberate their men, and escape to the seashore. The Vikings paddle out in a longboat pursued by Stark and his men.

Block and Rabin made a presentation about the effects which Corman called \\"breathtaking. Their pictures were beautiful, absolutely wonderful.\\" Corman felt the \\"script was not especially great\\" but was persuaded to do it but Block and Rabin's promise to work for a small fee in exchange for a cut of the profits. Corman was reluctant to put his own money into the film so went to AIP, who agreed to finance $70,000 to $80,000, although Corman said the presentation was more suited for a $2 million picture.Corman p 45 Corman was reportedly inspired to make the film by the production of The Vikings (1958). He felt if he made the movie fast enough he could have it in cinemas before that movie and take advantage of publicity for the bigger budgeted film.Weaver p 55 In June 1957 Corman announced he would make the film for $300,000, triple of what he was used to. He said $50,000 of the budget would be assigned to special effects by Block and Rabin; Corman would normally spend $2,000 on effects. Another article that month said the effects would cost $210,000 and the movie would be Corman's twentieth and most expensive film to date.

At Iverson's Ranch Corman made seventy seven set ups a day, his record. \\"It turned into an insanely difficult shoot,\\" he wrote.Corman p 45 On the first day of location work at Paradise Cove, the actress Corman had cast in the lead, Kipp Hamilton, held out for more money, so he fired her and promoted second lead Abby Dalton instead. Dalton's sister Shirley Wasden took Dalton's old role.Weaver p 56 According to Sayer filming was extremely hazardous due to the low budget and scenes involving boats and horses. Shirley Wasden injured herself falling off a horse and was replaced by June Kenny, although Wasden can be glimpsed on some scenes. Richard Devon also hurt his knee and almost drowned in the water.Weaver p 56-57Weaver and Brunas p 16 Susan Cabot recalled almost drowning, and says she and Abby Dalton once nearly rode horses off a cliff.

He was an absolute demon.\\"Weaver and Brunas p 16 It was with first film Michael Forest made for Corman. He met the director in an acting class and was cast.

I mean, if he asked you to climb up something and you said, \\"Where do you want us to climb?\\" he would climb up and show you ‚Äî \\"This is what I want you to do.\\" It wasn't as if he was saying, \\"Go out there and battle that tiger, I'll just stand back here and watch you do it\\" ‚Äî you know what I mean?

We couldn't figure out a way to put the title in two or three words, so I said let's go to the other extreme and give them the longest title they've ever seen and then use the great-est cliche in historical pictures at the time which is to open up on an engraved leather book, a hand comes in, opens the cover of the book, and there's the title of the picture.\\" Release The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent was released in theaters on April 10, 1958 by American International Pictures as a double feature with The Astounding She- Monster.Warren, Bill (1986). \\"Keep Watching The Skies Volume 2\\".

The film was distributed in the U.S. and the U.K. by Allied Artists. In the U.S., it was released as a double feature with Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. This low-budget feature was rapidly conceived, filmed, and released to exploit the international media frenzy surrounding the launch of the Russian Sputnik satellite, the first in space.WAR OF THE SATELLITES Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 29, Iss. 336, (Jan 1, 1962): 158. An \\"unknown force\\" declares war against Earth when the United Nations disobeys warnings to cease and desist in its attempts at assembling and then launching the first satellite into space. Plot Members of the United Nations space program are dismayed by the inexplicable annihilation of a manned satellite. The satellite is the tenth in the Sigma Project to be destroyed after coming into contact with a mysterious space barrier. At the control center, U.N. representative Mr. Akad demands that the project, which has yielded limited results, be terminated because of the loss of money and lives. Soon after, a young couple witnesses the landing of a small missile-like object which they turn over to authorities. After examining the capsule, the U.N. calls a meeting and reads aloud a message from the capsule that proclaims to be from the Masters of the Spiral Nebula Ghana, aliens displeased by Earth's repeated attempts to explore space. Calling humans a \\"disease\\", the aliens declare they will set up a quarantine to protect the universe. In response, Mr. Hotchkiss, the United States representative, gives a rousing speech asserting that no other life force has the right to thwart mankind's ambitions, and the continuation of the Sigma Project is enthusiastically approved. After the meeting, the head of Sigma, Dr. Van Ponder, tells reporters that he suspects that the message is a fake, but nevertheless announces his plan to lead the next satellite mission. In private, Van Ponder reveals to colleagues and mission crew members, astronomer David Boyer and researcher Sybil Carrington, that the capsule has defied all analysis and its origins remain unknown. Over the next several weeks, preparations for the next mission proceed. One evening, Hotchkiss summons Van Ponder to a U.N. meeting, but while driving there, Van Ponder's car is attacked by a mysterious ball of light, which drives him off the road. At the U.N., as Akad leads another diatribe against the project, Hotchkiss receives notification of Van Ponder's death. The council is stunned, however, when moments later, Van Ponder arrives at the meeting. Unknown to the council, aliens have assumed the form of Van Ponder to infiltrate the project. Later, alone in Hotchkiss' office, Van Ponder splits into two separate replicas of the scientist to extend his ability to impede Sigma. Back at the research center, David asks Van Ponder to reconsider Sybil's inclusion in the mission because he fears for her safety. As Van Ponder refuses, the men are interrupted by news that a large number of natural disasters have occurred worldwide. Speculation arises in the press that the disasters may be part of the U. N.'s strange warning from outer space. Van Ponder then suggests to Hotchkiss that in light of the events, they should call a halt to Sigma. After Hotchkiss reluctantly agrees, Van Ponder writes a letter to be read at the U. N. declaring the end of space exploration. David volunteers to present the letter, but at the council meeting makes an impassioned declaration that the Sigma Project will continue despite the alien intervention. Some days after, while chatting with Van Ponder in a lab, David is disconcerted to notice the scientist has identical markings on each arm, which prompts him to investigate Van Ponder's wrecked car. Meanwhile, while meeting with astronomical engineer John Campo at the lab, Van Ponder fails to notice that his hand is being burned by a torch. While John races for a doctor, Van Ponder heals the wound. When John arrives with Dr. Howard Lazar, Van Ponder's hand is intact, and when John insists that Van Ponder was severely injured, Howard suggests he has been working too hard. When David finds Van Ponder's demolished car, he realizes that no one could have survived the accident. David then contacts Sybil, only to learn that the Sigma launch has been moved forward and is to occur in a few hours. David hurries to the launch site, but realizes that he will be unable to speak with Sybil until after the launch. As preparations continue for blast-off, Van Ponder is unsettled to note that John is part of the crew. Later, while hurrying to his post, David is shocked to see Van Ponder replicate himself. Following the successful launch of the satellite, Van Ponder corners John in a small control room, paralyzes him so that he cannot escape, and then reveals that he is an alien. He explains that the warning from space came from powerful beings with the ability to transform energy into matter and back again. Van Ponder offers to transform John if he will help him, but when John adamantly refuses, Van Ponder kills him. After Sybil enters the control room and finds them, Van Ponder explains that John did not survive the ship's rapid acceleration process. While Van Ponder arranges a funeral service for John, David tells Sybil that Van Ponder is an alien, but Sybil refuses to believe him. Later, when David asks Howard about John's death, the doctor asserts that John was completely healthy. After David tells Howard that Van Ponder murdered John because he uncovered something Van Ponder was trying to conceal, Howard agrees to examine Van Ponder. Before meeting with Howard, Van Ponder creates a heart for himself, then is startled by his sudden surge of emotion for Sybil. While Sybil meets David to report Van Ponder's unusual behavior, Van Ponder murders Howard, then announces to the crew that he suspects David of having killed John. Just before his arrest, David, unaware of Howard's death, pleads with Sybil to seek protection with the doctor. Going in search of Howard, Sybil spots Van Ponder and takes refuge from him in the solar radiation room. Van Ponder follows her, but when he hears an announcement that David has escaped his guards, Van Ponder replicates himself in front of Sybil. While one replica goes after David, the other attempts to seduce Sybil. As the satellite nears the space barrier, the pilots are confused by Van Ponder's order to head toward it. David confronts one of the Van Ponder replicas and wounds him with a gunshot. After a fierce brawl, David finally shoots Van Ponder to death, after which the replica with Sybil also collapses and dies. David then orders the satellite to detonate a radiation blast which should catapult them through the barrier. David rescues Sybil from the radiation room just before the blast. David's plan succeeds and the Sigma satellite reports to Earth control that the universe lies before them.

In a 2019 interview, Corman recalled his meeting with Steve Broidy of Allied Artists: \\"I said, 'Steve, if you can give me $80,000, I will have a picture about satellites ready to go into the theaters in 90 days.'

He said, \\"I looked up at Dick Devon...and said 'Jesus Christ, I gotta beat him up'\\"? Miller added the part \\"didn't sit too well. It was a real, quote/unquote, leading-man type, and I was a foot too short for the part.\\" Miller said filming took place over a \\"leisurely\\" 10 days. > We had two of the best lounge chairs money could buy to take off for the > moon in.

Joe Bob Briggs called it \\"the best movie ever made in Deadwood, South Dakota.\\"  Premise  In 1944, five American soldiers lead by Lt. Factor are skiing on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines in Germany's Hurtgen Forest during World War II. The film starts with a fight between the Americans and Germans which has been ordered by Sgt Potter, to the annoyance of Lt Factor, who wants the patrol to be reconnaissance only. The next morning the troops see a large German unit with tanks. Factor radios back the information and discovers the Allies are under attack. The patrol runs into some Germans and a fight ensues in which an American is killed. The group finds a cabin, and order a young woman, Ilse to cook for them. She tries to poison the men's coffee, but Factor stops her. Then Ilse tries to shoot the soldiers, and they kill her. Factor orders the men to make camp at a nearby cave, where they celebrate Christmas. Factor decides to blow up a railroad trestle vital to the Germans. They run tino some Germans and a fight begins.

Griffith, who had worked a number of times for Corman. Griffth says he inspired in part by the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest, adding \\"Roger wanted the train thing. I forget which picture it was copying, but it was done in Hemingway‚Äôs A Farewell to Arms. They blew up a train and bridge in that one, and it was done all the time in Westerns. It was a pretty bad script. I remember nothing about that film but Roger skiing with the local ski club in Deadwood, North Dakota. All these teenagers who were playing Nazis, you know? [Laughs.]\\".Aaron W. Graham, 'Little Shop of Genres: An interview with Charles B. Griffith', Senses of Cinema, 15 April, 2005 accessed 25 June 2012 The movie was shot in Deadwood in the Black Hills over ten days.Roger Corman on Ski Troop Attack at Trailers From Hell Corman did this because he could hire a crew out of Chicago for lower rates than an LA crew. To amortize costs, Corman's brother Gene produced another film, Beast from Haunted Cave at the same time on the same location, utilising the same screenwriter and lead actors. The two films took five weeks in all the shoot, with one day off between films, and Beast was shot first. The unit was based at the Ben Franklin Hotel. Michael Forest says he was paid $500 a week and recalls \\"what was taking place was tough on us physically.\\" Roger Corman hired ski teams from Deadwood and Lead High Schools; one played the Germans and one played the Americans. He had to shoot them on weekends and after school. He cast a German ski instructor to play the head of the German ski troop, but the instructor broke his leg two days before the shoot. Corman decided to play the role himself, having skied occasionally at college; he took a one-day skiing lesson prior to filming. Corman recalls the shoot \\"as a very tough challenge. It was unbelievably cold and snowed all the time. The film's musical score, written by cellist Fred Katz, was originally written for A Bucket of Blood. According to Mark Thomas McGee, author of Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts, each time Katz was called upon to write music for Corman, Katz sold the same score as if it were new music. The score was used in a total of seven films, including The Wasp Woman and Creature from the Haunted Sea. Reception Variety liked the action sequences but found the characterization clich√©d and the lack of establishing shots to be a weakness. CEA Film Report found the movie to have little excitement and while the bridge explosion effect was good, it did little to help the movie. Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"a crude war film which just about gets by when it sticks to action. But the attempts at deeper meaning and characterisaton ends in cliches flying thick and fast.\\"SKI TROOP ATTACK Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 28, Iss. 324, (Jan 1, 1961): 24.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The authors of the Buildings of England series comment that it is \\"one of the most notable Victorian essays in half-timbered design anywhere in the country\\". History The house was originally built in 1891 for the soap manufacturer Robert William Hudson on Bidston Hill, Birkenhead. It was designed by the Liverpool architectural firm of George Enoch Grayson and Edward A. L. Ould (probably by Ould), and was then known as Bidston Court. It was the home of John Laird, Chairman of Laird Brothers Shipbuilders of Birkenhead (later Cammel Laird) until approximately 1910. In 1921 the house was later sold to Sir Ernest Royden, and he arranged for the house to be dismantled and rebuilt on the present site, at Royden Park, between 1928 and 1931. This work was supervised by the architectural firm of Rees and Holt. In 2001 the house was being used as an old people's home, and later in the 2000s it was converted into a hotel. Architecture Floorplan, c. 1909 The house is built on a U-plan. It is constructed in timber framing on a stone base, and has stone and brick chimney stacks and a slate roof. There are multiple gables and the half-timber exterior framing is highly decorated. Internally there is a great hall with an organ gallery and an open roof. In the great hall are a mantlepiece dated 1527, from a house of the father of Sir Thomas More, stained glass windows by William Morris, and a pair of church screen doors dating from the 13th century. In a room now used as a restaurant is a fire surround dated 1795 and designed by Robert Adam. It has been claimed that Bidston Court so impressed Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany when visiting Cammel Laird shipyards, that he built a copy of it in Potsdam. However the authors of the Buildings of England series point out that this is untrue, and that the house in Potsdam was only vaguely inspired by Bidston Court. Present day The house is now used as a hotel, and is known as Hillbark Hotel. It is licensed for weddings, and offers facilities for conferences. The hotel was used for the Juice FM Style Awards, which was filmed and featured in the reality television programme Desperate Scousewives on 29 November 2011 on E4. The grounds adjoining the hotel are used by the Hillbark Players, who present traditional open-air Shakespeare plays every two years in a purpose built 'theatre in the woods' with all seats under cover. The group take their name from Hillbark House and have been performing here since 1964 (the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth). Productions take place in June, in odd- numbered years.

Corman was also led to believe a donation in the right place would ensure 500 Greek soldiers fully costumed and equipped as extras for his massive army. Only 50 turned up, leading Corman to rapidly change his original screenplay to use a smaller group of soldiers.

The company focuses on the development, production and distribution of automation and detection products for life science laboratories. Founded in Switzerland, in 1980, the company has over 1200 employees, owns production and research and development sites in both North America and Europe, and maintains a sales and service network in 52 countries. In 2016, Tecan generated sales of CHF 506 million (USD 511 million; EUR 464 million). Registered shares of Tecan Group are traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange (TECN; ISIN CH0012100191).  History  Engineers Heinz Abplanalp, Heini Maurer, Heinz M√∂ckli and Gallus Blater founded Tecan on March 18, 1980, with the aim of developing measuring, analysis and laboratory automation devices. The first company office was in the home of the CEO, Heinz Abplanalp, in Hombrechtikon, Switzerland. Tecan soon also started to produce instruments for laboratory automation and environmental analysis. The first instruments were made in renovated barns, apartments and warehouses spread across the whole village of Hombrechtikon. In 1982, the company opened Tecan US in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for sales and marketing in North America, and Tecan Production Corp. to manufacture for the US marketplace. Two years later, 48% of the share capital was taken over by the finance company Zelux. In 1985, Tecan entered the market with the Tecan Sampler 500 series, the first process- controlled and fully automated pipetting devices. Other products included pH- electrodes, the Tecan Plant SAP Extractor 400 and the Tecan RSP 5052. In 1986, Tecan was nominated as the Swiss Company of the Year by Zurich industrialists Branco Weiss and by publishers Jean Frey and Ringier, and awarded the Branco- Weiss Prize for innovative companies (TV broadcast). In the same year, Tecan Holding AG was founded, and Tecan Asia opened in Singapore. With 80 employees, Tecan achieved a turnohares in the company. Tecan also acquired ten companies, including OEM liquid handling component manufacturer Cavro Scientific Instruments in the USA (today Tecan Systems, Inc.). In 1988, Tecan acquired SLT Laborinstrumente GmbH in Gr√∂dig near Salzburg, Austria (today Tecan Austria). At the end of the year, Tecan Holding included 29 companies. By the middle of 1989, Tecan was in financial difficulties, and trading in shares was temporarily suspended. In 1990, under CEO Hans Widmer, Tecan sold a large proportion of its daughter companies. Concentrating on its laboratory automation business, the company only retained its liquid handling robotics production sites in Switzerland, the USA and Austria, together with sales centers in Germany, the UK and the USA. The company returned to profit following this consolidation. Later in 1990, founder Heinz Abplanalp left the company, and Peter Bollmann become CEO. A year later, the other founding members also left the company. In 1993, Gottlieb Knoch took over the majority of Tecan shares as an industrial investor. He became President of the board and CEO of the Tecan Group. In 1994, all production sites were certified to ISO 9001. In 1995, the Genesis series of laboratory automation workstations was launched, based on new technology (electronics, communication protocols, new storage systems, etc.). In 1997, the life-sciences company Perkin-Elmer acquired the package of shares from Gottlieb Knoch and thus the majority of voting shares. In 1998, a collaboration followed with Abbott Laboratories in marketing Genesis FE 500 Workcell. In 1999, Emile Sutcliffe became CEO, and Perkin-Elmer sold its Tecan shares on the open market. Tecan was restructured and went public for the second time, listed in the main sector of the SWX Swiss Exchange. In 2001, Tecan moved to new headquarters in M√§nnedorf. Within two years, more than 5,000 Genesis platforms were sold. In 2003, the launch of the new Freedom EVO platform took place and Aitor Galdos became CEO, leaving the company at the end of 2004. In 2005, Tecan celebrated its 25th anniversary. Thomas Bachmann became CEO. Tecan took over REMP, a company based in Oberdiessbach, Switzerland, supplying automated laboratory and logistics systems in the life sciences sector. In 2006, Tecan Austria received two awards from the Federal State Salzburg, Chamber of Commerce. The first award cited Tecan Austria for being the most innovative company in industry with its ‚ÄòInfinite‚Äô series of multimode readers.

See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. that Li Zongmin began his service at the central government, as Jiancha Yushi (), a low-level imperial censor, and he was thereafter promoted to be L«êbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, L«êbu). In 817, when the chancellor Pei Du went to the frontline to oversee the imperial campaign against the warlord Wu Yuanji and, as part of his responsibilities, was made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhangyi Circuit (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), which Wu then held, he had a large number of imperial officials serve on his staff, and he had Li Jifu serve as his secretary in his capacity as military governor; it was said that it was because of Li Zongmin's service under Pei that he later began to receive prominence.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. After the end of the campaign, Li Zongmin was made Jiabu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of rites, and was also put in charge of drafting edicts.  During Emperor Muzong's reign  After Emperor Xianzong died in 820Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong, Li Zongmin was promoted to be Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). Meanwhile, at that time his father was also moved from being the ministry of imperial clan affairs () to be the prefect of Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), and their simultaneous commissions were considered to be an honor. However, in 821, Li Zongmin would be involved in the incident that was said to precipitate the Niu-Li Factional Struggles. At that time, Li Jifu's son Li Deyu was an imperial scholar and was still resentful of Li Zongmin's criticism against his father, and both Li Deyu and Yuan Zhen, who was a Zhongshu Sheren colleague of Li Zongmin's, were both struggling with Li Zongmin for power. Meanwhile, Li Zongmin's junior colleague at the legislative bureau, Yang Rushi () and the deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, L«êbu Shilang) Qian Hui () were in charge of overseeing the imperial examinations. The military governor Duan Wenchang (a former chancellor) and the imperial scholar Li Shen both made secret pleas to Qian for certain examinees. However, when the results were announced, the examinees that Duan and Li Shen recommended were not given passing results, while among those passing the examinations were Zheng Lang, the brother of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) official Zheng Tan; Pei Zhuan () the son of the military governor Pei Du (also a former chancellor); Li Zongmin's son-in-law Su Chao (); and Yang Rushi's brother Yang Yinshi (). This thus brought a popular uproar, and Duan submitted a report accusing Yang Rushi and Qian of being unfair. When Emperor Muzong requested opinions from the imperial scholars, Li Deyu, Yuan, and Li Shen all agreed with Duan's opinion. Emperor Muzong thus ordered Li Zongmin's colleague Wang Qi () to conduct a re- examination, while demoting Qian, Li Zongmin, and Yang Rushi to be prefectural prefects and deposing 10 of the examinees selected by Qian and Yang Rushi. In Li Zongmin's case, he was demoted to be the prefect of Jian Prefecture (ÂäçÂ∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan). However, Li Zongmin would not remain at Jian Prefecture for a long time, as he was recalled in or before 823 to be Zhongshu Sheren again. In winter 823, he was made acting deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, L√¨bu Shilang, note different tone than the ministry of rites), and was apparently responsible for the imperial examinations the following year, for following the imperial examinations in 824, he was made acting deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang).  During Emperor Jingzong's reign  In 825, by which time Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong was emperor, Li Zongmin was made full deputy minister of defense. Sometime thereafter, though, his father died, and he left government service to observe a mourning period for his father.  During Emperor Wenzong's reign  In 828, by which time Emperor Jingzong's younger brother Emperor Wenzong was emperor, Li Zongmin was recalled to the imperial government to serve as deputy minister of civil service affairs. In 829, Pei Du recommended Li Deyu, who was then the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) as chancellor, and Li Deyu was recalled from Zhenghai. However, it was said that because Li Zongmin was favored by powerful eunuchs, due to his association with Shen Yi, the husband of Emperor Xianzong's daughter Princess Xuancheng,New Book of Tang, vol. 83. and, through Shen, the female palace scholar Song Ruoxian () and the powerful eunuch Yang Chenghe () the director of palace communications,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245. Li Zongmin was made the deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, Zhongshu Shilang) and chancellor de facto with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Soon thereafter, Li Zongmin had Li Deyu, whom he viewed as a threat, sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). He also recommended Niu Sengru, who was then the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (Ê≠¶Êòå, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), and Niu was recalled to Chang'an to also serve as chancellor. It was said that the two of them worked together and began to eject Li Deyu's allies from the imperial government. In particular, because Li Deyu became resentful of Pei for having recommended Li Deyu, in late 830, because Pei had said that he was ill, Li Zongmin used the illness as reason to have Pei sent to Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei to be its military governor. In 832, Li Deyu, after a well-regarded stint as the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), was recalled to Chang'an, to serve as the minister of defense, and it was believed that because Emperor Wenzong was impressed by his service at Xichuan, Li Deyu would soon be chancellor. Li Zongmin, without Niu as an ally at Chang'an at this point (as Niu had resigned his chancellorship earlier in the year), was apprehensive of this development, and he consulted his associate, Du Cong the mayor of Jingzhao (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) as to what he should do. Du suggested a truce with Li Deyu ‚Äî pointing out that while Li Deyu, whose career as an official was launched by his status as Li Jifu's son rather than through imperial examinations, was deeply jealous of the officials who had gone through imperial examinations, and that Li Zongmin could effectuate a truce by recommending Li Deyu to be responsible for the imperial examinations. Li Zongmin did not want to do this, however, and under an alternative proposed by Du, offered to recommend Li Deyu as chief imperial censor. Du visited Li Deyu to inform him of this, and Li Deyu was grateful. However, after Li Zongmin consulted another associate, the imperial attendant Yang Yuqing (), Yang opposed this idea, and Li Zongmin did not actually recommend Li Deyu. In 833, Emperor Wenzong made Li Deyu a chancellor. When Li Deyu met with Emperor Wenzong to thank him, Emperor Wenzong asked him what the most pressing issue at the imperial government that he saw was, and Li Deyu indicated that it was partisanship ‚Äî knowing that at that time, Emperor Wenzong was already displeased with Yang Yuqing, whom Emperor Wenzong saw as participating in aggressive partisanship with his cousin Yang Rushi () (then a Zhongshu Sheren), brother Yang Hangong () (a supervisory official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu), and other associates Zhang Yuanfu () (a Zhongshu Sheren) and Xiao Huan () (also an imperial attendant). Li Deyu further used this to accuse others of being associated with Yang Yuqing in order to eject people he disfavored from the imperial government. Later in the year, after Emperor Wenzong, without consulting with Li Zongmin at all, made Zheng Tan the chief imperial censor, Li Zongmin was distressed. Soon thereafter, Li Zongmin was sent out of Chang'an to serve as the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital Xingyuan Municipality (), although he retained the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi designation as an honorary title. In 834, as Li Deyu had offended Emperor Wenzong's close associates Li Zhongyan and Zheng Zhu, as well as the powerful eunuch Wang Shoucheng (who had recommended Li Zhongyan and Zheng), Wang, Zheng, and Li Zhongyan wanted to find someone to counter Li Deyu. They knew that Li Deyu and Li Zongmin were political enemies, and so they had Li Zongmin recalled to Chang'an to again serve as Zhongshu Shilang and chancellor. Soon thereafter, Li Deyu was sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Shannan West Circuit. Li Deyu subsequently met with Emperor Wenzong and requested that he be allowed to stay at Chang'an, and so Emperor Wenzong initially made him the minister of defense again, but when Li Zongmin objected that Li Deyu should not be allowed to do whatever he wanted, Emperor Wenzong sent Li Deyu back to Zhenhai Circuit to serve as its military governor. In 835, there was a rumor spread at Chang'an that Zheng was creating immortality pills for Emperor Wenzong and that the pills required infant hearts and livers as ingredients. This caused much panic among the people, and Zheng, who had long despised Yang Yuqing (who was by this point the mayor of Jingzhao), accused Yang's family members of spreading the rumors. Meanwhile, Li Zongmin had also drawn Zheng's ire because he refused Zheng's request to become an official at either the legislative bureau or the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). Thereafter, when Yang was arrested and Li Zongmin tried to intervene on his behalf, Emperor Wenzong became so angry that he ordered Li Zongmin to leave his presence. Soon thereafter, Li Zongmin was demoted to be the prefect of Ming Prefecture (ÊòéÂ∑û, in modern Ningbo, Zhejiang). Soon thereafter, Zheng revealed that Li Zongmin had first become chancellor through the intercessions of Shen, Song, and Yang Chenghe, and Li Zongmin was further demoted to be the secretary general of Chu Prefecture (ËôïÂ∑û, in modern Lishui, Zhejiang), and then the census officer at Chao Prefecture (ÊΩÆÂ∑û, in modern Chaozhou, Guangdong). A large number of Li Zongmin's associates were also demoted, and it was said that Li Zhongyan (whose name had been changed to Li Xun by this point) and Zheng, whenever they disliked someone, would accuse that person of being an associate of either Li Zongmin's or Li Deyu's, thus causing massive demotions at the imperial government. Late in 835, a plot by Emperor Wenzong, Li Xun, and Zheng to slaughter the eunuchs (known as the Ganlu Incident) ended in utter failure, with the eunuchs slaughtering a large number of officials, including Li Xun, Zheng, and Li Xun's fellow chancellors Wang Ya, Jia Su, and Shu Yuanyu. Thereafter, in 836, it was said that those accused of being Li Deyu's and Li Zongmin's associates were beginning to receive reprieves, and Li Zongmin himself was moved closer to Chang'an, to serve as the military advisor to the prefect of Heng Prefecture (modern Hengyang, Hunan). By 838, Yang Sifu, who was friendly with Li Zongmin, was chancellor, and he wanted to have Li Zongmin recalled. He first consulted with Zheng Tan, who was also chancellor at that time, and Zheng opposed vehemently. Subsequently, Yang, Zheng, and fellow chancellor Chen Yixing (who also opposed any such recall) argued with each other in harsh words before Emperor Wenzong, drawing Emperor Wenzong's displeasure. In the aftermath of the argument, Li Zongmin was moved to be the prefect of Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) but not recalled to the capital.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. In 839, Li Zongmin was given an honorary title as a staff member of the Crown Prince Li Yong but had his officer in the eastern capital Luoyang. That year, Zheng and Chen were removed from their chancellor positions, and Yang was said to want to again try to have Li Zongmin recalled to serve as chancellor, but before he could do so, Emperor Wenzong died in spring 840.  During Emperor Wuzong's reign  Emperor Wenzong's brother Li Chan the Prince of Ying, with support from the powerful eunuchs Qiu Shiliang and Yu Hongzhi (), became emperor (as Emperor Wuzong). As neither Yang Sifu (who was believed to have supported another brother of Emperor Wenzong's, Li Rong the Prince of An) nor Yang's ally Li Jue (who was believed to have supported Emperor Wenzong's nephew and Emperor Jingzong's son Li Chengmei ‚Äî whom Emperor Wenzong had made crown prince but was bypassed by the eunuchs) had supported Emperor Wuzong, they were soon stripped of their chancellor posts, and Li Deyu was recalled to be chancellor. Li Deyu soon dominated the court scene. In 843, after Liu Congjian the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) died, his nephew Liu Zhen tried to take over the circuit without imperial sanction, and Emperor Wuzong ordered a general campaign against Liu Zhen. Li Deyu used this opportunity to accuse Li Zongmin of having associated with Liu Congjian and thus should not be allowed to be at Luoyang, close to Zhaoyi. Li Zongmin was thus demoted to be the prefect of Hu Prefecture (ÊπñÂ∑û, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247. After imperial forces defeated Liu Zhen in 844, Li Deyu further accused Li Zongmin and Niu Sengru of having been complicit in Liu Zhen's rebellion ‚Äî going as far as (after failing to uncover actual evidence of communications between Liu Congjian, Li Zongmin, and Niu) having Liu Zhen's secretary Zheng Qing () state falsely that whenever Liu Congjian received letters from Li Zongmin or Niu, he would burn them after reading them ‚Äî Emperor Wuzong, in anger, exiled both Niu and Li Zongmin ‚Äî in Li Zongmin's case, demoted in multiple stages, first to be the prefect of Zhang Prefecture (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian), then to be the secretary general of Zhang Prefecture, and then to be an exile without any officers at Feng Prefecture (Â∞ÅÂ∑û, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong).  During Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign  In 846, Emperor Wuzong died and was succeeded by his uncle Emperor XuƒÅnzong. Emperor XuƒÅnzong had long despised Li Deyu's hold on power, and soon thereafter Li Deyu was stripped of his chancellor position. Further, five chancellors whom Emperor Wuzong had exiled ‚Äî Li Zongmin, Niu Sengru, Cui Gong, Yang Sifu, and Li Jue ‚Äî were all soon ordered to be moved closer to the capital, with Li Zongmin ordered moved to Chen Prefecture (ÈÉ¥Â∑û, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan) to be the military advisor to its prefect, but it was said that Li Zongmin died before he could be moved.

In the episode, Phineas Flynn is challenged to a thumb wrestling competition at the mall with the local bully, Buford, after he accidentally embarrasses him in the food court. Meanwhile, the evil Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz tries using a hypnotic contraption to force everyone to celebrate his birthday and clean up their mess after the party. \\"Raging Bully\\" was written by series co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh and directed by Povenmire. Heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield guest starred as himself, training Phineas for the big thumb-wrestling match. The episode originally broadcast on Disney Channel on February 6, 2008, as part of the month-long special event, \\"Phineas and Ferb-urary.\\" It received generally positive reviews from television critics and the featured musical number, \\"He's a Bully,\\" became available on the official Phineas and Ferb soundtrack in 2009. Plot summary While at the food court in the mall, Phineas accidentally drops his ice cream cone on bully Buford's pants, causing the whole food court to laugh at Buford. Enraged, he challenges Phineas to a fight right there, but boxing champion Evander Holyfield arrives and convinces them to instead fight in an organized thumb wrestling match later that day, which Buford accepts. Despite being cautioned by Phineas and Ferb's friends Baljeet and Isabella, Holyfield trains Phineas through simple tasks, including punching a chain of sausages and playing Dance Dance Revolution. Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus arrives at an abandoned cake factory, where he is trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device- \\"the Slave-inator\\"- to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and the machine is activated, but while trying to get Perry to let go of the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday. Doofenshmirtz, defeated, drops the ice cream cone he is eating in the fight and it falls to the ground below. Finally, the big match commences and Phineas is vigorously beaten by Buford in each round. When the final round begins, Buford overpowers Phineas and pulls him up through the air. Just then, Doofenshmirtz's ice cream cone falls and lands on Phineas's head. Buford is satisfied now that Phineas is embarrassed and calls off the match. The audience who was watching cleans up the mess (due to Doofenshmirtz's machine accidentally telling them to). At the parking lot a few minutes later, Phineas thanks Holyfield for his help and Holyfield walks off. Ferb makes a comment which accidentally offends Buford and he is about to be beaten up, but he knocks Buford out with a Vulcan nerve pinch, to Phineas's surprise. When Phineas asks him why he did it he responds, \\"Well, he was all up in my face.\\" Production Evander Holyfield guest starred in the episode as himself. \\"Raging Bully\\" was written by Phineas and Ferb co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh. It was storyboarded by artists Wendy Grieb and Kent Osbourne and was directed by Povenmire, who managed the bulk of animation direction in the series along with Zac Moncrief. It was originally broadcast in the United States on February 4, 2008, on Disney Channel with a TV-G parental rating. It was part of the network's marathon event \\"Phineas and Ferb-urary,\\" which debuted new episodes of the series every night for the entire month. Heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield guest starred in the episode as himself, appearing at the mall to help train Phineas for the big thumb wrestling match against Buford. Holyfield's guest performance was heavily expected since the original announcement of guest stars lined up for the series released in September 2007. Cast members response to working with Holyfield was highly positive; Vincent Martella and Alyson Stoner, who portray Phineas and Isabella respectively, cited working along guest stars like him as a benefit of working on the show. In 2008, \\"Raging Bully\\" became available on the DVD compilation Phineas and Ferb: The Fast and the Phineas, along with fellow first season episodes of the series \\"One Good Scare Ought to Do It!\\" \\"Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror,\\" \\"The Fast and the Phineas,\\" \\"Are You My Mummy?\\" \\"Flop Starz,\\" \\"Lights, Candace, Action!\\" and \\"It's About Time!\\" In 2009, the episode's song, \\"He's a Bully,\\" became available on the official Phineas and Ferb soundtrack.

The film marked Jane Wyatt's screen debut. It is based on a 1933 novel by John Galsworthy.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1931-40, c. 1993 by The American Film Institute The novel was the conclusion of a trilogy the Nobel Prize-winner conceived as a supplement to his popular \\"Forsyte Saga,\\" which told of generations of an upper middle class English family through the period when the stability of the Victorian era gave way to the uncertainties and tensions of modernity. Universal snapped up the film rights to this best seller and gave the prestigious project to its star director, James Whale.

Wells's book, \\"The Invisible Man\\", have fashioned a grand picture out of the late John Galsworthy's last novel.\\" More recently, Chris Fujiwara wrote on TCM.com, \\"One More River was released in August 1934 to great critical enthusiasm, which was not matched by popular interest. The mediocre box-office performance of the film, together with its genteel tone and its detailed concentration on the texture of social interaction, helped doom the film to undeserved neglect. It has rarely been revived and has received little attention from critics or historians, except in the context of auteurist appreciation of Whale's career. One More River needs rediscovery.\\" Interest in Mrs. Patrick Campbell, and her relationship with George Bernard Shaw, can also spark topicality on the film. Film historian William K. Everson considered the film \\"by far Hollywood's most successful attempt at putting any aspect of England on the screen.\\" Everson wrote: \\"Perhaps as an Englishman I am nostalgically over-enthusiastic because I have never seen such a convincing and 'right' Hollywood film about England ... Perhaps I am also nostalgically enthusiastic because of its pleasing, gentle, civilized reflection of an England that is largely no more\\"...In its visual style, the film confirms Whale's immense talent, still too little known apart from Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House, The Invisible Man, and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Colin Clive's first appearance, in a series of four shots that showcase his stiff swagger and superior scowl, is as devastating an entrance as any ever accorded a screen villain. The courtroom sequence is an astounding piece of filmmaking, with Whale's elaborately mobile camera accentuating the vastness of the space and setting off the rich contrasts in acting styles among the participants.\\" References External links Films based on works by John Galsworthy 1934 films American films American black-and-white films Films directed by James Whale Films based on British novels American drama films Films set in London Films set in Oxfordshire Universal Pictures films Films about marriage 1934 drama films ","title":"One More River"},{"id":"25079889","text":"Sinners in Paradise is a 1938 American south seas adventure film directed by James Whale and starring Madge Evans, John Boles, Bruce Cabot, Marion Martin and Gene Lockhart.

Cuba Center is the former home and family estate of Lammot du Pont Copeland and his wife, Pamela Cunningham Copeland. In 1935, the Copelands built a stately Colonial Revival manor house near the village of Mt. Cuba, outside of Wilmington, Delaware. The Copelands were prominent members of the community. Mr. Copeland served as President and Chairman of the DuPont Company, while Mrs. Copeland was a leader in many community and cultural organizations. During the late 1930s, formal areas were designed first by the prominent Philadelphia landscape architect Thomas W. Sears and later, in the 1950s, by noted landscape designer Marian Cruger Coffin.[2] In the 1960s, the Copelands were becoming acutely aware of a changing land ethic and they became more interested in ecology and the need for conservation. Mrs. Copeland, in particular, was increasingly concerned about wildflowers and the impact on them by development and unscrupulous practices. In response, landscape architect Seth Kelsey was hired to develop the woodland wildflower gardens with native plants, design their ponds, and plan many woodland garden paths. In 1983, Dr. Richard Lighty was hired by the Copelands as their first Director of Horticulture. The Copelands expanded their horticultural endeavors to study native plants of the Appalachian Piedmont, the beginnings of a botanic garden on a private estate. That same year, Mr. Copeland passed away. In the late 1980s, Mt. Cuba Center began hosting visitors by offering docent-led tours during the spring. Mt. Cuba Center horticulturists also began documenting their increasingly diverse native plant collections. In 2001, Mrs. Copeland died. Mt. Cuba Center was no longer a botanic garden on a private estate but a public garden for all to be inspired about native plants. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Continuing education classes started in 2006. In 2013, Mt. Cuba Center launched general admission during the spring, summer, and fall seasons.

Biographical sketch Following his highschool graduation in Dresden in 1909, Lipps began studying art history, architecture, aesthetics and philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 1910‚Äì1911 while doing his military service in Dresden he continued his philosophical studies at Dresden's University of Technology. In the spring of 1911 he moved to G√∂ttingen to study with Edmund Husserl. Together with Theodor Conrad and his wife, Hedwig Conrad-Martius, as well as Roman Ingarden and Fritz Kaufmann, Lipps belonged to the famous \\"Philosophical Society of G√∂ttingen\\" that gathered around Husserl and Adolf Reinach. This society also included Edith Stein, who described the young Lipps as follows: \\"He was very tall, slender but strong; his handsome, expressive face was fresh like a child's and his big round eyes were earnest ‚Äì questioning like a child's eyes. He usually uttered his opinion in a short but definitive statement.\\"Edith Stein, Werke VII: Aus dem Leben einer j√ºdischen Familie, ed. by L. Gelber and Romaeus Leuven (Louvain: Nauwelaerts, 1965), p. 178. Lipps also studied biology. In the winter of 1912 he completed a doctorate with a dissertation entitled \\"About structural changes of plants in a modified medium\\", after which he began to study medicine. Between 1914 and 1918 he served in World War I as an assistant army physician. After the war he continued his interrupted studies in G√∂ttingen and Freiburg i. Br. and completed his formal medical degree. In 1919 he received his license to practice medicine, and in 1920 he published a Ph.D. dissertation in medicine addressing \\"... the effect of certain colchicine derivatives\\". In 1921 he completed his habilitation (qualification for professorship) under the mathematician Richard Courant, whom he had met through Edith Stein, with a dissertation entitled \\"Investigations into the philosophy of mathematics\\". Lipps had close personal links with the philosophers Josef K√∂nig, Helmuth Plessner, and Georg Misch. During the academic year 1923/24 he and Misch conducted a seminar on the theory of signification (hermeneutics). In 1928 Lipps substituted for the professor of philosophy at the University of Marburg. Having declined a professorship at the University of Santiago de Chile, he accepted in 1936 the position of Ordinarius (chair professor) of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt am Main. Throughout his academic career, Lipps continued occasionally to practice medicine, substituting alternatively for army physicians and country doctors. During the term breaks 1921/1922 and again 1930/1931, when he was already teaching as a professor, he served for extensive periods as a doctor in the navy, traveling to all continents except for Australia. In 1934 Hans Lipps joined the SS.Christian Tilitzki: Die deutsche Universit√§tsphilosophie in der Weimarer Republik und im Dritten Reich, Teil 1. Akademie Verlag, Berlin 2002 , p. 636 According to Otto Friedrich Bollnow, Lipps did so to put a distance between himself and the NSDAP, submitting that SS was a purely military organisation.Waltraud Herbstrith, Edith Steins Unterst√ºtzer: Bekannte und unbekannte Helfer w√§hrend der NS-Diktatur, Lit Verlag, M√ºnster, 2010, p. 83, . At the beginning of World War II in September 1939 he was drafted to the military and served as an army doctor in France and Russia. He lost his life in a battle at Shabero/Ochwat on 10 September 1941 and was buried in the nearby cemetery of Dudino.See: Eberhard Av√©-Lallemant, \\"Daten zu Leben und Werk von Hans Lipps,\\" in: Dilthey- Jahrbuch f√ºr Philosophie und Geschichte der Geisteswissenschaften 6 (1989), pp. 13-21 [15]. Philosophy as responsible self-acceptance According to Lipps, human existence is grounded in the interpretation of reality. Asking about what something is refers to and fundamentally involves the human being, in relation to whom everything primarily is. Husserl, too, demands a reversion. Yet his return is not directed towards the concrete human being but instead to a \\"transcendental ego\\" through which the concrete human being is to be constituted in the first place. Martin Heidegger substituted Husserl's intentional analysis of \\"transcendental consciousness\\" with the existential analytic of Dasein, as it has been expounded in Sein und Zeit in terms of a fundamental ontology. Like Heidegger, Lipps inquires about the Sein of the concrete human being. While Heidegger interprets this Sein as a phenomenon in the sense of something \\"which-shows-itself,\\" Lipps begins from the question: \\"Inwiefern wird in der mannigfachen Bedeutung des Seienden gerade die Verfassung meiner Existenz Erfahrung?\\" (To what extent does the manifold signification of Seiendes lead to the experience of the constitution of my existence?)Die menschliche Natur, p. 47. With this question, Lipps moves closer to Husserl's method of transcendental inquiry (\\"transzendentale Leitf√§den\\"). Unlike Husserl, however, Lipps is neither concerned with the constitution of Seiendes, nor ‚Äì as Heidegger is ‚Äì with the question about the \\"Sein des Seienden\\". From Lipps's point of view, Sein cannot be disentangled from the concretization of its essence (\\"was\\"). His focus is on the manifold meanings of being (\\"sein\\"): the \\"is\\" in statements such as \\"is blue\\", \\"is a lion\\", \\"is iron\\", \\"is rain\\", \\"is a speech\\", \\"is greed\\", etc. denotes different things and differs in its respective meaning. From this Lipps concludes: \\"Es gibt keine universelle Ontologie.\\" (There is no universal ontology.)Untersuchungen zur Ph√§nomenologie der Erkenntnis, part II, Aussage und Urteil p. 13. Since Lipps writes this shortly after reading Sein und Zeit, as he mentions in the preface of volume II, one must assume that he is deliberately commenting on Heidegger. So what exactly is the subject matter of Hans Lipps's philosophy? Does his thought move on a trajectory from the essence of things (\\"das Was der Dinge\\") via \\"language\\" (\\"Sprache\\") to the \\"human being\\" (\\"Mensch\\"), as his three major treatises might suggest? Lipps states: \\"Die Weise, in der der Philosophierende existiert, sich vor sich selbst bringt in der Bewegtheit seiner Einstellung - aber kein Gegenstand - bestimmt die Philosophie.\\" (Philosophy is determined not by the object but by the mode in which the philosophizing subject exists and how it relates to itself in the movement of its perception) (Die menschliche Natur, p. 56. See also Untersuchungen zu einer hermeneutischen Logik, pp. 21-22, note 1.) Philosophy is neither defined by a specific subject matter, nor a clearly delineated field of investigation; it cannot be compartmentalized into disciplines or taken into possession. \\"Philosophy\\" describes a direction and a point of view one cannot assume deliberately as it consists in an attitude that develops in direct opposition to my natural inclination. Philosophy does not intend to lay new grounds; rather it occurs \\"als verantwortliche √úbernahme schon geschehener Grundlegung\\" (as a responsible adoption of an already existing groundwork).Untersuchungen zu einer hermeneutischen Logik, p. 62. See also Die menschliche Natur, p. 56. Lipps's term \\"Grundlegung\\" is rendered here in parallel to English translations of Kant's \\"Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten\\". In philosophy I become conscious of myself. Philosophy traces back to, and brings to awareness, what has been present before without being conscious of itself (\\"an ihm selber in seiner Vorg√§ngigkeit unbewu√üt\\"Untersuchungen zu einer hermeneutischen Logik, S. 60.). Thus I seek to become aware of myself in my origins, and consequently attain an original relationship to reality, not by disposing of prior decisions - which would be impossible - but by accepting myself in these prior decisions. Such a philosophy is not geared toward enlightenment but toward a responsible appropriation of myself in my origins, toward a responsible performance of my existence, toward existing properly. In this regard philosophy specifically is existential philosophy. The term of reference of philosophy is reality (\\"Wirklichkeit\\"), to which I have always already reached out and within which I have gained pre-predicative understanding of myself as well as of reality. It is in this relationship that reality becomes real and that the human being realizes itself. The reality of myself as well as of other people is directed toward the reality of things, which refers back to the former. It is only in such proportionality that anything exists at all. It is ultimately for this reason that everything that is real and to the extent that it is real refers back to my own and other people's (practical and theoretical) ability by which human existence is realized. Such relationship is therefore an \\"indicator of existential possibilities\\": a piece of iron, the color blue, vision, cognition, embarrassment, etc. Philosophy unveils human existence as the center of reality - in analogy to the interpretation of a text. For Lipps, philosophy is therefore a hermeneutics of reality directed at human existence for the purpose of enabling the latter to its own realization. As Lipps understands it, \\"hermeneutics\\" necessarily implies a fundamentally retroactive dimension. Philosophy qua hermeneutics of reality is tied up with language, through which alone reality ‚Äì both in terms of objects or things as well as of human beings - is being revealed. It is therefore the foremost task of philosophical inquiry to take up and follow the hints toward meaning and signification embodied in word and speech. And it must clarify those hints and explicate the pre-predicative mode of understanding they represent as grounded in the logos. This leads to the problem of the openness of the meaning of words.In open contrast to Husserl's theory of the \\"Ideal unities of significance\\" Lipps emphasized the \\"open indifference\\" of many utterances whose meaning changes according to the change of speech situation. This resembles Wittgenstein's conception of \\"language games\\" (a similarity seen for the first time by Gottfried Br√§uer). A further similarity exists between Wittgenstein's \\"concepts with blurred edges\\" (Philosophical Investigations ¬ß 71) and the \\"envisageing conceptions \\"Untersuchungen zu einer hermeneutischen Logik. S.92. which in both cases are illustrated by the word \\"Spiel\\". There is, however, no trace of any influence on either side. Works Hans Lipps: Werke in five volumes. Frankfurt a.

It was written by Paul Levitz and John Byrne, and pencilled by Byrne, Greg LaRocque and Mike DeCarlo. The story arc was DC‚Äôs first attempt to correct the inconsistencies in Legion history created when the original Superboy was removed from mainstream DC continuity in the Man of Steel limited series. In the aftermath of the Zero Hour and Infinite Crisis miniseries, this story is no longer canonical. Plot In the 30th century, Legion of Super-Heroes co- founder Cosmic Boy and his girlfriend Night Girl (of the Legion of Substitute Heroes) have returned from a journey to 20th century Earth, where they were attacked by the Time Trapper and found history altered such that Superman never had a teenage career as Superboy.Cosmic Boy #1‚Äì4 (December 1986 ‚Äì March 1987)Prior to this story arc, it was established that Superman began his career as a pre-adolescent, using the name \\"Superboy\\". ‚Äì More Fun Comics #101 (January/February 1945) Brainiac 5, Ultra Boy, Sun Boy, Cosmic Boy, Night Girl, Blok, Invisible Kid (Jacques Foccart) and Mon-El take a Time Bubble in an effort to breach the Trapper‚Äôs \\"Iron Curtain\\" and reach his Citadel at the End of Time. However, the Trapper redirects them to 20th century Smallville, Kansas, the home of Superboy. Several of the Legionnaires try to blend into town wearing 20th century clothing when they are recognized by Pete Ross, Superboy‚Äôs best friend and an honorary Legionnaire.Pete Ross was made an honorary Legionnaire for safeguarding Superboy‚Äôs secret identity, with even Superboy himself unaware that Pete knew his secret. ‚Äì Superboy #98 (July 1962) After Pete makes a passing reference to Superboy saving Smallville from \\"red skies\\" and an energy wall,Red skies and waves of antimatter preceded the destruction of numerous parallel universes in the Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series (April 1985 ‚Äì March 1986). the Legionnaires arrive at the Kent General Store, where Mon-El and Ultra Boy are reunited with Jonathan and Martha Kent.Mon-El met the Kents shortly after arriving on Earth in Superboy #89 (June 1961), while Ultra Boy first visited 20th century Smallville in Superboy #98 (July 1962). Later that evening, Superboy (as Clark Kent) arrives at the Kent farm. He surprises the Legionnaires by using the Phantom Zone Projector to freeze them in time-stasis. Realizing that something is amiss, Pete locates and warns the remaining Legionnaires, who enter the Time Bubble and escape into the time stream, just as Superboy arrives to attack them. Just over a decade later, Brainiac 5, Sun Boy, Blok and Invisible Kid arrive in Smallville, almost immediately attracting the attention of Superman. The Legionnaires attack him, occasionally calling him Superboy. However, Superman does not recognize them, and knows of no one named Superboy except Superboy- Prime,At this point, the character was simply referred to as the Superboy from Earth Prime. The name \\"Superboy-Prime\\" is not used until Infinite Crisis #2 (January 2006). who has not been seen since the Crisis. When Superman has no recollection of meeting and being inducted into the Legion,Superboy joined the Legion in Adventure Comics #247 (April 1958). it becomes apparent that he is a separate individual from the Boy of Steel. Suddenly, Superboy arrives, places the Legionnaires in time-stasis and returns to his own time. Superman follows, barely able to keep up with the faster Superboy. From his Citadel, the Time Trapper observes the transpiring events. He also recalls how he created a \\"pocket universe\\", with its own Earth, its own Krypton and its own Kal-El. In this pocket universe, Kal-El became Superboy at the age of eight, and it is to this universe that the Trapper has directed the Legion whenever they have travelled through time. In the pocket universe, Superman encounters Pete Ross and the Kents (who initially assume that he is their Superboy, aged due to exposure to red kryptonite), but is soon attacked by Superboy. After the two engage in combat for a time, with Superboy's greater power being countered by Superman's superior experience, Jonathan Kent attempts to stop Superman using multiple varieties of kryptonite, but they are ineffective because Superman hails from a parallel universe. However, Superman soon deduces that Superboy has been continually holding back, giving Superman opportunities to win their battle, forcing him to admit that he knows he is in the wrong. Superboy and the Legion depart to rescue the other Legionnaires and face the Time Trapper. They leave Superman behind, fearful of the consequences to history if he is killed or otherwise unable to return. Superboy explains to the Legionnaires that the Time Trapper protected Earth in his era from destruction during the Crisis, and promised to keep it safe in return for Superboy's cooperation in defeating the Legion. When they find the Trapper, they engage him in battle, inadvertently smashing the machine that protected the pocket universe Earth from the effects of the Crisis. With the red skies and antimatter returning (and with Brainiac 5 unable to repair the machinery), Superboy replaces the damaged unit with his own body. The gambit works and the Earth is saved, but the Boy of Steel is gravely weakened. With the Trapper having now made time travel perilously unsafe, Superboy flies the Legionnaires back to the 30th century, carrying the Time Bubble himself. Shortly after their arrival, Superboy dies in Mon-El's arms. The entire Legion mourns his passing, remembering him as \\"the greatest hero of them all.\\" Aftermath =Superman= Following Superboy's disappearance from the pocket universe Earth, the Lex Luthor of that world is tricked into releasing Kryptonian criminals General Zod, Quex-Ul and Zaora from the Phantom Zone. They proceed to lay waste to the planet, eventually killing its entire population. Having been summoned from the regular universe by Luthor and Supergirl, Superman executes the genocidal killers using green kryptonite, and brings Supergirl (a protoplasmic duplicate of Lana Lang) with him back to his own Earth.Superman vol. 2, #21‚Äì22; Adventures of Superman #444 (September‚ÄìOctober 1988) =Legion of Super-Heroes= While the entire Legion mourns Superboy's death, four members are particularly outraged: Saturn Girl (one of the three founders who invited Superboy to join),Saturn Girl, Cosmic Boy and Lightning Lad recruited Superboy in Adventure Comics #247 (April 1958). Brainiac 5 (who now realizes that all of his theories about time travel are incorrect),Brainiac 5's interest in time travel is first seen during the Legion's original encounter with Rond Vidar and his villainous father Universo in Adventure Comics #349 (October 1966). Mon-El (who regards Superboy as a brother),When they first met, Superboy and Mon-El erroneously believed that they were brothers. ‚Äì Superboy #89 (June 1961) and Duo Damsel (who considers Superboy to be her first love, having once had an unrequited crush on him).Duo Damsel's infatuation with Superboy is first suggested in Adventure Comics #348 (September 1966), and is confirmed in Adventure Comics #369 (June 1968). The four secretly enter into a conspiracy to attack and destroy the Time Trapper at the End of Time. With the assistance of honorary Legionnaire Rond Vidar (who reveals himself to be the Green Lantern of Sector 2814),Rond Vidar was made an honorary Legionnaire after he assisted the Legion in thwarting one of Universo's plots to conquer Earth. ‚Äì Adventure Comics #360 (September 1967)Prior to this battle Rond Vidar kept his membership in the Green Lantern Corps hidden, due to a previous antagonistic encounter that the Corps and the Guardians of the Universe had with the Legion. This encounter prompted the government of Earth to ban all Green Lanterns from the planet. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, #295 (January 1983) they barely succeed. However, another one of Duo Damsel's three bodies is killed, leaving her with only one.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #46‚Äì50 (May‚ÄìSeptember 1988)During her days as Triplicate Girl, Duo Damsel's first body was destroyed by Computo, a rogue artificial intelligence created by Brainiac 5. ‚Äì Adventure Comics #340 (January 1966)In the \\"Five Years Later\\" era of Legion continuity, during which the Time Trapper is supplanted by Glorith, it is revealed that Duo Damsel's second body was restored to life by Glorith. She was forced to act as a servant of Glorith until the Legion helped her to escape years later. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #42 (April 1993) Continuity =The Man of Steel= When DC Comics decided to revamp the Superman mythos following the Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series, it released John Byrne's 1986 limited series The Man of Steel. Under the new chronology, Clark Kent did not begin his career as a costumed superhero until adulthood. This created major inconsistencies in Legion history, for not only did Superboy join the team as a teenager, but he serves as the primary inspiration for the founding of the Legion itself.Superboy #147 (June 1968) In order to resolve this discrepancy and preserve as much of Legion history as possible, the \\"Greatest Hero of Them All\\" story arc was crafted, establishing that Superboy was a different being from a different universe, and that the Legion had not previously journeyed to the mainstream universe seen in post-Crisis continuity. =Removal from the Superman family= Eventually, the DC editors determined that the connection between Superman and the Legion should be completely severed. Legion writers Keith Giffen, Tom and Mary Bierbaum and Al Gordon revised the team's history, such that the Time Trapper was replaced in continuity by his former underling Glorith.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #4‚Äì6 (February‚ÄìApril 1990) In this new timeline, Lar Gand became an intergalactic legend in the 20th century, adopting the codename Valor instead of Mon-El. Glorith would later banish Valor to a 1000-year imprisonment in the Phantom Zone (renamed the Bgztl Buffer Zone).Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, Annual #2 (1991) As a consequence of these changes, the \\"Greatest Hero of Them All\\" story arc was rendered non- canonical. In 1994, DC released the Zero Hour: Crisis in Time limited series, as a means of resolving several paradoxes in the DC timeline. Subsequently, Legion continuity was completely rebooted, and the Post-Zero Hour team that was introduced thereafter had no connection to Superman or Superboy, with Valor once again serving as the team's inspiration.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 4, #0 (October 1994) Another reboot in 2004 would introduce a third version of the Legion, one inspired by the costumed heroes of the 21st century, but not Superman in particular.Teen Titans/Legion Special (November 2004); Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 5, #1 (February 2005)Eventually, it is revealed that this team hails from Superboy-Prime's homeworld, Earth Prime. ‚Äì Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (September 2009) =Post-Infinite Crisis= An additional major revamp to DC continuity occurs via the 2005‚Äì2006 limited series Infinite Crisis. Among the resulting changes is the restoration of much the Legion's pre-Crisis history. Once again, Superman is the legendary hero who serves as the inspiration for the Legion. As in the original Legion story, the three founding members journeyed to the past to invite the teenage Clark Kent to join the team.Justice Society of America vol. 3, #5 (June 2007); Action Comics #858 (December 2007) However, he only uses the name Superboy in the 31st century as a Legion member,Adventure Comics vol. 2, #1 (October 2009); Superman: Secret Origin #2 (December 2009) and his 21st century career as a superhero does not begin until he reaches adulthood.Superman: Secret Origin #3 (January 2010) Collected editions This story is included as part of the trade paperback collection Superman: The Man of Steel, Vol. 4 ().

A drunken Steve ends up returning home with the club's wily hostess, Grena (Joan Dowling). Just then Jan calls, and announces she's returning that night to the flat.

He played for Leicester between January 1920 and 1935 and made a total of 557 senior appearances,filbertstreet.net stats including 528 in the Football League, the Foxes club record. Early life Born in Denny, prior to joining Leicester Black fought in World War I with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and won the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his gallantry near M≈ìuvres on 21 March 1918. The citation for his DCM stated that Black \\"bombed out a large portion of a trench captured by the enemy in spite of strenuous opposition. His initiative, leadership and personal gallantry were worthy of the highest praise\\". Career Black made his debut for Leicester on 24 January 1920 in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Hull City after becoming one of Peter Hodge's first signings for the club and began to establish himself as a first team regular the following season. Over the following few seasons under Hodge, Leicester were slowly built into a Second Division force and Black helped the club to the Second Division title in 1924‚Äì25. Black later played a key role as part of the team which finished in the club's highest ever league finish of runners-up in the First Division in 1928‚Äì29. He progressed to captain the team. Despite playing 557 times for Leicester, he only managed to score 4 times. Three of his goals were penalties and the other a bizarre 60 yard free- kick against Sunderland in 1933, which Black accidentally over hit. The closest he came to international recognition was an appearance in the annual Home Scots v Anglo-Scots trial match in 1923.Football International Trial Match, The Glasgow Herald, 21 March 1923 Legacy A suite at Leicester's home ground, the King Power Stadium, is named in his honour.Function Suites thewalkersstadium.com.

Lee Thompson and written by Ted Willis, from his 1948 stage play of the same name. Plot Initially, the film's story is told by Frank (Ronald Howard) a local plain clothes policeman in love with Hetty (Sylvia Syms), to a young tearaway Kenny (David Hemmings). In the slums of London before World War II, Tommy (Melvyn Hayes) is an aimless teenager who tries to escape his squalid surroundings by entering a life of crime. He falls in with local racketeer Wilkie (Herbert Lom), who holds the rest of the slum citizens - including Tommy's own family - in a grip of fear. For a brief period, Hetty (Tommy's older sister) becomes Wilkie's girlfriend until he humiliates her in front of the other slum citizens simply to show his power over them, after which she will have nothing to do with Wilkie despite him repeatedly asking her to come back to him. The film chronicles Tommy's sordid progression from minor thefts to murder. At the end of the film, Hetty and Frank are seen to be married and living in a new council flat long after the slums have been demolished.

Critical reception TV Guide wrote \\"NO TREES suffers from artificiality of plot and dialog. Characterizations are reduced to mere stereotypes...There are some notable exceptions within the drama, however. Syms is surprisingly moving, giving a sensitive performance despite the film's constraints. Holloway's characterization of a bookie's tout is comical and charming...The camerawork attempts a realistic documentary look, which manages to succeed in capturing the details of slum life that make the setting seem surprisingly naturalistic. The finer points of the film, however, are overshadowed by its faults.\\" Time Out wrote \\"released at a time when kitchen sink drama was all the rage, this is an unremarkable 'we had it tough' chronicle from another age.\\" Variety wrote \\"Ted Willis is a writer with a sympathetic eye for problems of the middle and lower classes...Syms gives a moving performance as the gentle girl who refuses to marry the cheap racketeer just to escape.

Lee Thompson and starring Ingrid Thulin, Maximilian Schell, Samantha Eggar and Herbert Lom. It is based on a novel by French crime writer Hubert Monteilhet, adapted for film by prolific screenwriter Julius J. Epstein. The novel would also serve as the source material for the 2014 German film Phoenix, directed by Christian Petzold, though the latter film makes multiple changes to the book's elements and concerns itself solely with the plot to reclaim an inheritance. Plot summary Shortly before the Nazi invasion of France, Dr. Michele Wulf (Thulin) encounters the younger Stanislaus Pilgrin (Schell) over a game of lightning chess, not being aware that Pilgrin is a chess master. She becomes intrigued with the fortune-hunting Pilgrin and the two begin a liaison. Upon the Nazi invasion, in order to protect Michele, who is Jewish, Stan marries her, to no avail it turns out when the Gestapo arrests her and sends her to a concentration camp. Sometime after the war, Michele returns under the identity of Mme. Robert and encounters her colleague, plastic surgeon Dr. Charles Bovard (Lom), who at first does not recognize her because of her disfigured state. She undergoes plastic surgery to restore some of her looks and then by chance encounters Stan, who believes her to have died during the war. Surprised at the resemblance, Stan tells her that Michele's step- daughter Fabi (Eggar) cannot inherit her step-mother's estate because no body was ever produced. He asks \\"Mme. Robert\\" to impersonate Michele and she agrees. Upon moving back into her own house, Michele quickly becomes aware that Fabi, now a beautiful woman, resents her for her former neglect, and what is worse, is now Stan's lover. Eventually, Michele reveals herself and insists on resuming her relationship with her husband. While taking a bath after consuming alcohol and barbiturates, the jealous Fabi tells Stan her plan for killing her step-mother. Stan will go to another city on the pretext of attending a chess championship. He will set up a gun to go off when Michele opens her safe. After establishing his alibi, he will call her and tell her that he has put a gift for her in the safe. When he hears the shot, he will know she is dead, and he can return home to adjust the scene to make the death appear a suicide. Though it is not clear if Fabi is serious, the amoral Stan drowns her in the bathtub in such a way that it looks like an accident related to an overdose, and then carries out her plan. When he returns, he discovers what appears to be Michele's body, but is caught by the police in the act of manipulating the scene. Charles, who has loved Michele all along, had entered the room just as she was opening the safe and caused her to step aside to avoid the bullet. Cast * Ingrid Thulin as Dr. Michele \\"Mischa\\" Wolf * Samantha Eggar as Fabienne Wolf * Maximilian Schell as Stanislaus Pilgrin * Herbert Lom as Dr. Charles Bovard * Talitha Getty as Claudine Original novel The film was based on the novel el Le retour des cendres (Phoenix from the Ashes) by Hubert Monteilhet, which was published in 1961. It was published in the USA under the title Return of the Ashes. The Los Angeles Times said if the plot \\"seems on the surface incredible, the marvel is that Monteilhet brings it off, achieving that suspension of disbelief.\\" The film softens some of the darkness of the 1961 source novel, Le Retour des cendres. There it is her husband who betrayed her to the Germans and it is the girl, her daughter by a previous husband rather than a stepdaughter, who kills her in the end. Production The novel was optioned by Henri-Georges Clouzot who ended up selling the rights to director J. Lee Thompson whose films Clouzot admired. In May 1963 Thompson listed the film as among his projects. In October 1963 the Mirisch Company announced that the film would be one of six movies the company would make over four months at a total cost of $17 million. The other films were A Shot in the Dark, The Satan Bug, Bandoola, The Confessor, and The Dazzling Hour (which became Kiss Me Stupid). In November Julius Epstein was reportedly working on the script. In March 1964 Hedda Hopper announced that Sue Lyon would star. Filming was pushed back ‚Äì in June 1964 the Mirisches said the movie would be part of a slate of 14 films made over 18 months worth $51 million (others including Hawaii, The Hallelujah Trail, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, A Rage to Live, Bandoola, The Confessor, The Law and Tombstone, Cast a Giant Shadow, What Did You Do in the War Daddy, A Garden of Cucumbers, Return of the Seven, The Off-Islanders and Richard Sahib). In November 1964 it was announced the stars would be Maximilian Schell and Gina Lollobrigida. Lollobrigida was replaced by Ingrid Thulin, and sued the production company for $1 million. Samantha Eaggar was under exclusive contract to Thompson's production company. The film was shot on the MGM backlot at Borehamwood in February 1965. Thompson said he liked to move the camera \\"to accent the restlessness, the emotional strains of these people, who are highly strung and neurotic. For once, I hope, the camera will help create characters rather than just reflect them.\\" Thompson says Schell's character \\"lives by the creed of The Brothers Karamazov. Anything is permissible that is necessary to achieve an end. He does not mean to commit murder.\\" Reception =Critical= Variety in its original review said that \\"Return from the Ashes does not always reach its mark as a thriller... Thompson... establishes a tense mood frequently, but level of interest suffers from character fuzziness which occasionally clouds the issue.\\" References External links Return from the Ashes at Letterbox DVD *Review of film at Cinema Retro 1965 films British films Films directed by J.

Litigation In November 2009 the book received further attention when federal judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ordered several of the book's source documents removed from Gaubatz's website, after CAIR brought a federal civil lawsuit against Gaubatz and his son (who had obtained the documents as a CAIR intern) for stealing the documents.25-page Opinion of Federal judge Kollar- Kotelly in Counsel on American-Islamic Relations vs. Gaubatz (November 3, 2009), accessed November 17, 2009Doyle, Michael, \\"Muslim Mafia Author Ordered to Remove Documents from Web\\", Kansas City Star, November 9, 2009, accessed November 15, 2009Laney, Mary, \\"What is Going On in America?

As a result, the judge ordered Gaubatz to remove certain documents from his website. Judge Kollar-Kotelly also said that CAIR's employees reported a dramatic increase in the number of threats by email, letter, or phone by since the release of Gaubatz's book. Gaubatz agreed in early November to return more than 12,000 pages of CAIR records while the judge considered the lawsuit, but in late November before he could do so the U.S. Government, which previously had no role in the lawsuit, filed a sealed motion in the case and agents from the FBI served the Gaubatzes' attorneys with a grand jury subpoena demanding the records. Other media sources carrying commentary on the book included Politico, which reported on CAIR's lawsuit against the Gaubatzs, noting: \\"In an interesting twist, despite the book's harsh claims that CAIR is part of a 'jihadist network,' the suit does not allege libel or defamation\\".Likely such claims would be difficult to prove in an anti Muslim atmosphere the book intended to create.

The ship was built in 1932 by the Mathis Yacht Building Co. of Camden, New Jersey, as the yacht Alamo as confirmed by the oval shipbuilder's plate affixed in the upper access portion of its engine room. Alamo was designed by Tams, Incorporated for William F. Ladd with a cruising radius of 4,000 miles and a fresh water capacity of 5,500 gallons. A pair of Winton diesel engines of 375 horsepower each and two 15kw Winton diesel generators provided propulsive and electrical power. A speed of was achieved in trials. The hull construction made extensive use of welding. Before Navy acquisition the yacht, Mathis hull #214, official number 231388, had been named Rellimpa, Ranley, and Ronaele. The yacht was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 3 January 1942, renamed Alabaster on 13 January 1942 and simultaneously classified a coastal patrol yacht and designated PYc-21. Converted by the Philadelphia Navy Yard for naval service, it was commissioned on 31 January 1942, with Lt.Cmdr. A. F. Edel, USNR, in command. Service history =World War II, 1942‚Äì1945= Assigned to the Inshore Patrol and based at the section base at Cape May, New Jersey, Alabaster began patrolling the coast of the United States from Delaware Bay to Chesapeake Bay early in February and continued that assignment through the remainder of 1942 and most of 1943. In September 1943, the Navy decided to convert the vessel to an anti- submarine warfare (ASW) training platform. She spent the next two months in the Philadelphia Navy Yard receiving the modifications needed to prepare her to carry out her new mission, On 30 November, she stood out of Philadelphia, bound for the Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island. The following day, the patrol yacht reported for duty with the Commander, Anti-submarine Development, Atlantic Fleet, at Quonset Point and began a month of training to ready her crew for the new assignment. On 5 January 1944, she completed her training and received orders to report to the Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier for routing to the Canal Zone. Alabaster departed Cape May on 10 January and steamed ‚Äî via Charleston, Miami, and Guantanamo Bay ‚Äî to Balboa, Canal Zone, where she arrived on the 25th. The ship reported for duty with the 7th Fleet and got underway on 1 February with an oil tanker bound for Australia. The patrol yacht entered port at Cairns, Australia, on St. Patrick's Day, but put to sea again on 25 March. The little warship arrived in Milne Bay, New Guinea, where she remained for about three months instructing Navy men in the use of various ASW devices. In mid-June, she moved to Seeadler Harbor at Manus in the Admiralty Islands where she resumed ASW training duties. On 19 October, she departed Manus to return to New Guinea and dropped anchor at Hollandia on the 21st. She remained at that base until the end of January 1945, providing ASW training services and making emergency repairs to radar and sonar equipment, On 31 January 1945, she weighed anchor and shaped a course for the Philippines. Alabaster arrived in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 6 February and resumed her previous training and repair missions. The end of the war in mid- August 1945 found her still at Leyte, and she was then declared surplus to the needs of the Navy. The yacht cleared San Pedro Bay to return to the United States. Steaming via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, Alabaster entered port at San Pedro, California, on 25 October. She remained anchored in the bay at San Pedro until decommissioned on 17 December 1945. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 21 January 1946, and she was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal. =In private ownership, 1947‚Äì1982= Alabaster was initially sold on 9 April 1947 to Lyman A. Whitney, of San Diego, California, however this purchase was never completed, and she was finally purchased by Col. C. S. Smith, USAR, Ret., who restored her as a private cruising yacht and renamed her Alamo. In 1959‚Äì1960 she was the setting (called Fortuna II) for the CBS television series Mr. Lucky, starring John Vivyan, Ross Martin and Pippa Scott. Alamo was sold in 1960 to Enrique Braun of Acapulco, renamed Fiesta II, and served as a harbor cruise vessel until 1982. In that year it was sold and towed to Puerto Vallarta to be converted to a floating restaurant. It caught fire and sank during conversion and its wreckage is now a popular scuba diving venue.

The movie is also notable for early film cameos by Jeff Goldblum and Robert Englund. Goldblum was reprising his role of the maniacal street punk he had first adopted in Death Wish (1974). Reception The film's box office performance was described as \\"modest\\". It currently has a score of 38% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 8 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and called it \\"an ambitious Charles Bronson picture that looks good but finally doesn't quite work.

A self-taught player, he was influenced by Leon McAuliffe with Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys.Don Waren Interview Warden formed his own band during high school, The Rhythm Rangers, playing steel guitar and singing. He also had an afternoon radio show on KWPM-AM in West Plains, Missouri. The band gained popularity, moving on to Kennett, Missouri's KBOA-AM and KHWN-AM in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and gigs in East Texas honky tonks; eventually leading to Louisiana Hayride, backing The Wilburn Brothers and Red Sovine. Warden left the show in 1951 for a two-year stint with the US Army. Returning to the Hayride after the Army, the Rhythm Rangers continued to back Red Sovine until Sovine left to join the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, leaving his band behind. Warden moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended flight school and played local clubs in his spare time. =With Porter Wagoner= While visiting his parents in West Plains, Warden met Porter Wagoner at KWTO- AM in Springfield, Missouri. With Speedy Haworth, they formed the Porter Wagoner Trio and were regulars on ABC television's Ozark Jubilee broadcast from Springfield.

Description  At over in length, Pollnagollum is the longest cave on the island of Ireland and the third deepest cave in the State. The system primarily consists of winding stream passages which interconnect in various ways, offering a great variety of through trips. The cave is usually entered via the Pollnagollum entrance, with the main streamway encountered a short distance inside. The main streamway continues for most of the length of the cave with several smaller inlets entering along its length. Near the southern end of the cave the Poulelva pot is encountered; the two entrances are often used for through-trips. Much of the water in the cave is fed from the sinks of Upper Pollnagollum, at the point where surface water runs off the shale bedrock and sinks into the permeable limestone. The terminus of the cave is a low bedding plane which eventually becomes too low to progress. The water resurges at the Killaney rising to the south of the cave.  History  The first known exploration of the cave was by T. J. Westropp in 1880, venturing as far as the Main Junction, but it was not until the 20th century that serious exploration began. E. A. Baker undertook the first systematic exploration of the cave in 1912 and returned in 1925. During the 1925 trip, Baker carried out a partial survey. In 1935 the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club recorded the first descent of Poulelva. In 1944 the Royal Irish Academy published a major survey and article by J. C. Coleman and N. J. Dunnington. In 1952 cavers from the RAF discovered Branch Passage Gallery and in 1953 they connected it to the rest of the cave. A full survey was carried out in the 1960s by the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society, by which time of cave had been discovered. The survey has been kept up to date by the society as cavers continue to add to its length to this day. Pollnagollum is one of the most popular and most visited caves in the country for cavers, and is often done as a beginners' trip.

History MOGIS was founded by Christian Bahls (himself a victim of child abuse) on 1 April 2009 in Rostock in reaction to plans by the German Minister for Family Affairs, Ursula von der Leyen, to use domain name block lists to fight against child pornography on the internet. The organization represents victims of child abuse who argue that such block lists are ineffective in reducing child pornography on the internet. They also criticize that those lists, which were planned to be made by the German BKA without any oversight might lead to the establishment of online censorship and that the whole proposal uses victims of child abuse to further a political agenda that would not do anything to help those victims. Similar concerns had been raised in March 2009 regarding use of blacklists for internet censorship in Australia. They caused a stir in May 2009 when they proved that a survey that saw 92% of Germans in favor of such plans was a result of the way the question was asked and that a survey commissioned by MOGIS with the same institute lead to a 95% opposition amongst those questioned when the question included the fact that the content of those internet sites is still available despite the blocks. MOGIS was cited in many influential German blogs as well as traditional media outlets and served to strengthen the credibility of those opposing such measures. MOGIS and Wikipedia On 15 October 2009 the article on MOGIS was deleted from the German Wikipedia for not meeting the strict notability requirements of the project. This led to widespread criticism in the German blogosphere, where the strict notability criteria of the German Wikipedia have been described by some as \\"censorship\\" and has led to news coverage in multiple media outlets discussing those notability requirements. It has also led to a surge of low-amount donations to Wikimedia Deutschland, the German Wikimedia chapter, with comments criticizing the deletion decision.

Estimates are that there are over 400,000 Mamprusis living in the Northern Regions of Ghana, and about 11,000 in Togo. They speak Mampruli, a Gur language. In Ghana, the Mamprusis live mainly in Nalerigu, Gambaga, Walewale, Wungu, Yama, Kpasenkpe, Janga, Bulbia, Loagri, Kpatorigu, Sakpaba, Yagba, Kubori, Lukula, Yizeesi, Tantaala, Mankarigu, Nasia, Yikpabongu, Kparigu, Wulugu, Kurugu, and their surrounding towns and villages in the North East region. They also inhabit parts of the Upper East Region. Mainly in Bawku proper, but also in Bolgatanga, Tongo, Bongo. And the Upper West Region, too. The Mamprugu Kingdom was founded around the 13th century by the Great Naa Gbanwah/Gbewah at Pusiga, a village 14 kilometres from Bawku, which is why Mamprusis revere Bawku as their ancestral home.

As a consequence, the King of Mossi of Burkina Faso, to this day is enskinned by the Nayiri ‚Äì the king of Mamprugu. Thus, establishing this kingdom as the pre-eminent of its kind.

The story follows a teenage girl who discovers that her stepfather is trying to murder her and her mother, but when she tells people, no one will believe her. Former Led Zeppelin member John Paul Jones composed the musical score. Plot In New Rochelle, New York, Christie, a teenage girl discovers that her stepfather Paul is trying to murder her and her mother Karen for her money, but when she tries to tell other people about it, no one will believe her. After a maintenance worker dies in the basement, Christie believes Paul set the trap for her mother after she saw him leave the basement the previous night. Christie begins following Paul everywhere and discovers he is having an affair with a young attractive woman named Brenda. She is caught by Brenda's brother Lacey but manages to run away. Paul convinces Karen that Brenda is a client of his and she believes him over her daughter. Christie convinces Josh, her best friend Janey's boyfriend, to accompany her to catch Paul, but the brakes to her mother's car have been tampered with, almost killing them. Christie and Janey discover Paul and Brenda at a motel and run when Paul sees them. Janey tells Christie she is pregnant by Josh, but moments later is killed in a hit and run by an unseen driver. Christie tells the police that Paul killed Janey, intending to kill her, but she is not believed. Josh sticks up for Christie after she is bullied and blamed for Janey's death. Later, she loses her virginity to Josh but they are interrupted by Paul, who orders Josh to leave; when Christie goes to the bathroom, she notices gas, now suspecting that Paul is trying to kill her too (as she would be entitled to her mother's inheritance before he would be). Karen also falls down the stairs after a trap Paul set for her, putting her in a wheelchair. Christie takes a picture of Paul and Brenda having sex but drops the picture and is seen; while retrieving the picture she overhears that Brenda and Lacey are in fact a married couple who plan to blackmail Paul after he kills Karen and Christie. She shows her mother the picture and Paul is ordered to leave. At midnight, Paul, Brenda and Lacey invade the house and force Christie and Karen to the basement, revealing their plans to kill them both at 2 a.m. and blame it on a burglar. Christie tells Paul about the real relationship between Brenda and Lacey, which angers him. Christie tricks Brenda into letting her out to go to the bathroom while Karen cuts the electricity to the house from the basement, giving Christie a chance to run and stab both Lacey and Paul. After Brenda attacks Karen and turns the lights back, on Christie surrenders herself to Lacey and both victims are forced back to the basement, where they devise another plan to escape by wetting the fuse box. At 2 a.m., they are ordered upstairs but are interrupted by Josh knocking at the door. Lacey orders Christie to open the door and get rid of him. Josh is suspicious and informs the police. When the electricity goes off, both mother and daughter flee their attackers. Lacey orders Brenda to go to the basement and turn the lights back on, but the wet fuse box electrocutes Brenda. After almost catching Karen, Lacey runs to the basement after hearing Brenda's scream and finds her dead. Christie tricks Paul into believing she is in her bathroom when Paul enters the gas filled bathroom with a lighter; it explodes and he is killed. Josh saves Christie from the burning house. With their ordeal over, Christie and Karen reside at another house temporarily when Josh comes over to kiss Christie; Lacey appears and hits Josh and plans to kill Christie for what she did to Brenda. Christie pulls out a knife and stabs Lacey through the stomach, killing him.

In response to the growing indecency of the Wooten corner, the Abilene city council resurrected an antique city ordinance forbidding the ogling of unescorted ladies. Indeed, the Wooten was very much at the center of the Abilene social scene for much of the middle part of the twentieth century. By the 1970s, however, commerce had shifted south as Abilene burgeoning population spread ever outward. The hotel, along with much of downtown Abilene, would fall into a state of disgrace and disrepair. For several years, the Wooten was rechristened \\"The Abilene Towers Apartments.\\" It became notorious for the chunks of masonry and debris that would often rain down on unsuspecting pedestrians below as it crumbled beneath the west Texas sun. Finally, as it seem inevitably doomed to slip beyond the reach of the possibility of restoration, the Wooten was swept up in the revitalization that had already consumed much of downtown, starting with Wooten's neighbor, The Paramount Theater. The tower underwent a complete overhaul in 2005 by the Beaumont Texas Contractor Daniels Building and Construction and is now home to the most expensive apartments, per square foot, in the city.

The organization published a weekly newspaper called Workers' Challenge and was effectively dissolved at the insistence of the Communist International by the time of the Bridgman Convention of August 1922 with its members rejoining the mainline Workers Party of America. A tiny underground rump organization resisted merger and continued an independent existence throughout the decade of the 1920s. History In late 1921 and early 1922 a faction began to develop within the Communist Party of America which was upset with the direction the party was taking regarding legality and the creation of the \\"above ground\\" Workers Party of America. The dissident elements met at en emergency convention on January 7, 1922 and seceded from the party, declaring themselves the \\"real\\" CPA. In the historical literature this group is identified either as the CPA (central caucus), CPA (Left Opposition) or CPA (Uniter Toilers) after their legal front.Draper, Theodore The roots of American communism New York, Viking Press pp. 353-54 Despite being opposed to the timing and method of the creation of the Workers Party of America, they were not opposed in principle to the creation of an above ground organization. In fact, at the January convention, representatives of the small Proletarian Party had been present to persuade the delegates to choose that group as their legal arm.http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/communistparty.html However the PPs overtures were rejected and the constituency groups in the Central Caucus met in conference in New York on February 18 to form the United Toilers of America as the groups \\"legal\\" organization. The groups which were represented at this conference reflect the largely immigrant and foreign speaking character of this faction: Workers' Defense Conference of New England, the Alliance of Polish Workers of America, the Ukrainian Association, the Lettish Publishing Association, the Polish Publishing Association, the Lithuanian Workers' Association, the Woman's Progressive alliance.http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/unitedtoilers.html The UTA faction was hampered from the beginning because the Comintern itself had ordered the creation of the legal party, in keeping with in the international turn of \\"line\\" toward legality and the United Front. In March, the Comintern held a hearing on the issue in Moscow, with Heinrich Brandler, M√°ty√°s R√°kosi, Ottomar Kuusinen, Boris Souvarine and Boris Reinstein presiding. The official CPA was represented by Max Bedacht and L.E. Katterfeld, and the UTA group by John Ballam. The Cominterns decision came down in no uncertain terms in favor of the official party, declaring that the group that held the Comintern line was the rightful Communist Party even if it represented a minority of the membership. John Ballam returned to the US on May 7 and a conference of the Central Caucus was held the next day at which Ballam reported his capitulation to the Comintern and urged the group to go back into the official CPA-Workers Party fold. The conference however \\"repudiated\\" his report and declared it would go on until they could present their case before the next Comintern Congress. They reasoned that Moscow had been \\"misinformed\\" about the real situation in America, and if only the Comintern leaders could be made aware of it, they would decide in their favor.Draper, Theodore The roots of American communism New York, Viking Press pp. 356-58 Before that congress could meet, however, the Comintern sent a special representative to the US with the mission to, among other things, reunite the party. At a convention of the UTA group in late September he negotiated the return of most of the faction to the official fold. A small minority however would not rejoin the party and remained underground. It sent \\"Sullivan\\", Alfred S. Edwards,http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/unitedtoilers.html to the 4th Comintern congress that December to harangue the delegates about the \\"Menshevik\\" leadership of the American party and even the right wing tendencies in the Comintern itself.Draper, Theodore The roots of American communism New York, Viking Press pp. 383 In James P. Cannons memoir, The History of America Trotskyism, he mentions finding the group still active in 1929. They still used the old conspiratorial methods such as secret meetings and pseudonyms; one member even recognized Cannon, and started to address him as \\"Comrade Cook\\", his party name from years earlier. He in turn recognized their leader as \\"Sullivan\\" from the old days. By this time the group was headquartered in Boston and had a branch in Cleveland. They were willing to join the Trotskyists if they were going to be an underground organization. Writing in his memoir in 1944, Cannon guessed \\"I suppose they are still underground.\\"Draper, Theodore The roots of American communism New York, Viking Press pp. 388-89  Publications  The faction published two English language publications, The Communist for the under ground party and Workers Challenge for the UTA proper.

Pyne was the fourth child of the Reverend William Masters Pyne and his wife Marian. Rev W. M. Pyne came from Ballyvolane near Cork but he was the Rector of St Mary's Church in Oxted, Surrey, from 1828 to 1869, a remarkable tenure of 41 years. The Pyne family lived in the Rectory (now called Oxted Place) until the Rev W. M. Pyne inherited Ballyvolane House on his father's death.  Career  Douglas Pyne was educated at Tonbridge School and inherited Lisfinny Castle near Tallow, County Waterford from his uncle. Pyne was an ardent advocate for the rights of the Irish tenant farmers. As an Irish Parliamentary Party candidate for the Western division of Waterford at the general election in October 1885, he was called to court to show cause why he should not give security to keep the peace. Pyne had made a speech in which he had said that \\"there are two ways of treating a land-grabber ‚Äì one was to shoot him, and the other, which he believed was the best, was to treat him with all charity and the cold of silence.\\" However, the magistrates refused to consider the authorities' application and Pyne was set free, winning the subsequent election with over 90% of the votes cast, and taking his seat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. In November 1887, during the Land War, a warrant was issued for Pyne's arrest. Pyne had previously destroyed the entrance to his Castle, and retreated to an upper storey, where he had laid in provisions. When there was a crowd gathered Pine would descend on the pulley and bucket which he had fixed to the third floor and address the crowd from 30 ft off the ground, while the police looked on helplessly. On the night of 9 November 1888 the people of Tallow marched to the Castle led by the town band. Thousands of visitors came to Lisfinny day after day, encouraging and cheering Pyne. He addressed the crowd at Lisfinny for the last time on 12 December, but escaped that night, having passed unrecognised through the police cordon after the cattle were driven in earlier to surround the castle. Pyne was arrested in London on 10 February 1888, as he was entering the House of Commons. On 14 February, he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, which was later reduced to six weeks. In November 1888, Pyne disappeared off a boat between Holyhead and Dublin, and was presumed to have drowned. His parliamentary seat remained vacant for a further fifteen months, before the writ was moved for the by-election.

XC is an imperative language, based on the features for parallelism and communication in occam, and the syntax and sequential features of C. It provides primitive features that correspond to the various architectural resources provided, namely: channel ends, locks, ports and timers. In combination with XCore processors, XC is used to build embedded systems with levels of I/O, real-time performance and computational ability usually attributed to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices. Introduction =Architectural model= An XC program executes on a collection of XCore tiles. Each tile contains one or more processing cores and resources that can be shared between the cores, including I/O and memory. All tiles are connected by a communication network that allows any tile to communicate with any other tile. A given target system is specified during compilation and the compiler ensures that a sufficient number of tiles, cores and resources are available to execute the program being compiled. Features of XC The following sections outline the key features of XC. =Parallelism= Statements in XC are executed in sequence (as they are in C), so that in the execution of: f(); g(); the function is only executed once the execution of the function has completed. A set of statements can be made to execute in parallel using a statement, so that par { f(); g(); } causes and to be executed simultaneously. The execution of parallel statement only completes when each of the component statements have completed. The component statements are called tasks in XC. Because the sharing of variables can lead to race conditions and non-deterministic behaviour, XC enforces parallel disjointness. Disjointness means that a variable that is changed in one component statement of a may not be used in any other statement. Parallel statements can be written with a replicator, in a similar fashion to a loop, so that many similar instances of a task can be created without having to write each one separately, so that the statement: par (size_t i=0; i<4; ++i) f(i); is equivalent to: par { f(0); f(1); f(2); f(3); } The tasks in a parallel statement are executed by creating threads on the processor executing the statement. Tasks can be placed on different tiles by using a prefix. In following example: par { on tile[0] : f(); par (size_t i=0; i<4; ++i) on tile[1].core[i] : g(); } the task is placed on any available core of tile 0 and instances of the task placed on cores 0, 1, 2 and 3 of tile 1. Task placement is restricted to the function of an XC program. Conceptually, this is because when an XC program is compiled, it is divided up at its top level, into separately executable programs for each tile. =Communication= Parallel tasks are able to communicate with each other using interfaces or channels. Interfaces An interface specifies a set of transaction types, where each type is defined as a function with parameter and return types. When two tasks are connected via an interface, one operates as a server and the other as a client. The client is able to initiate a transaction with the corresponding server, with syntax similar to a conventional function call. This interaction can be seen as a remote procedure call. For example, in the parallel statement: interface I { void f(int x); }; interface I i; par { select { // server i.f(int x): printf(\\"Received %d \\", x); break; } i.f(42); // client } the client initiates the transaction , with the parameter value 42, from the interface . The server waits on the transaction (as a case in the select statement) and responds when the client initiates it by printing out a message with the received parameter value. Transaction functions can also be used for two-way communication by using reference parameters, allowing data to be transferred from a client to a server, and then back again. Interfaces can only be used by two tasks; they do not allow multiple clients to be connected to one server. The types of either end of an interface connection of type T are server interface T and client interface T. Therefore, when interface types are passed as parameters, the type of connection must also be specified, for example: interface T i; void s(server interface T i) { ... } void c(client interface T i) { ... } par { s(i); c(i); } Transaction functions in an interface restrict servers to reacting only in response to client requests, but in some circumstances it is useful for a server to be able to trigger a response from the client. This can be achieved by annotating a function in the interface with no parameters and a void return type, with . The client waits on the notification transaction in a select statement for the server to initiate it. A corresponding function can be annotated with , which is called by the slave to clear the notification. In the following simple example: interface I { void f(int x); notification slave void isReady(); clears_notification int getValue(); }; interface I i1, i2; par { for (size_t i=0; i<2; ++i) { // server select { i2.f(int x): i1.isReady(); break; i1.getValue() -> int data: data = 100; break; } } { int d; // client 1 select { i1.isReady(): d = i1.getValue(); break; } } i2.f(42); // client 2 } when client 2 initiates the transaction function , the server notifies client 1 via the transaction function . Client 1 waits for the server notification, and then initiates when it is received. So that it is easier to connect many clients to one server, interfaces can also be declared as arrays. A server can select over an interface array using an index variable. Interfaces can also be extended, so that basic client interfaces can be augmented with new functionality. In particular, client interface extensions can invoke transaction functions in the base interface to provide a layer of additional complexity. Channels Communication channels provide a more primitive way of communicating between tasks than interfaces. A channel connects two tasks and allows them to send and receive data, using the in and out operators respectively. A communication only occurs when an input is matched with an output, and because either side waits for the other to be ready, this also causes the tasks to synchronise. In the following: chan c; int x; par { c <: 42; c :> x; } the value 42 is sent over the channel and assigned to the variable . Streaming channels A streaming channel does not require each input and matching output to synchronise, so communication can occur asynchronously. =Event handling= The statement waits for events to occur. It is similar to the alternation process in occam. Each component of a select is an event, such as an interface transaction, channel input or port input (see #IO), and an associated action. When a select is executed, it waits until the first event is enabled and then executes that event's action. In the following example: select { case left :> v: out <: v; break; case right :> v: out <: v; break; } the select statement merges data from and channels on to an channel. A select case can be guarded, so that the case is only selected if the guard expression is true at the same time the event is enabled. For example, with a guard: case enable => left :> v: out <: v; break; the left- hand channel of the above example can only input data when the variable is true. The selection of events is arbitrary, but event priority can be enforced with the attribute for selects. The effect is that higher-priority events occur earlier in the body of the statement. To aid in creating reusable components and libraries, select functions can be used to abstract multiple cases of a select into a single unit. The following select function encapsulates the cases of the above select statement: select merge(chanend left, chanend right, chanend out) { case left :> v: out <: v; break; case right :> v: out <: v; break; } so that the select statement can be written: select { merge(left, right, out); } =Timing= Every tile has a reference clock that can be accessed via timer variables. Performing an output operation on a timer reads the current time in cycles. For example, to calculate the elapsed execution time of a function : timer t; uint32_t start, end; t :> start; f(); t :> end; printf(\\"Elapsed time %u s \\", (end- start)/CYCLES_PER_SEC); where CYCLES_PER_SEC is defined to be the number of cycles per second. Timers can also be used in select statements to trigger events. For example, the select statement: timer t; uint32_t time; ... select { case t when timerafter(time) :> void: // Action to be performed after the delay ... break; } waits for the timer to exceed the value of before reacting to it. The value of is discarded with the syntax , but it can be assigned to a variable with the syntax . =IO= Variables of the type port provide access to IO pins on an XCore device in XC. Ports can have power-of-two widths, allowing the same number of bits to be input or output every cycle. The same channel input and output operators and respectively are used for this. The following program continuously reads the value on one port and outputs it on another: #include in port p = XS1_PORT_1A; out port q = XS1_PORT_1B; int main (void) { bool b; while (1) { p :> b; q <: b; } } The declaration of ports must have global scope and each port must specify whether it is inputting or outputting, and is assigned a fixed value to specify which pins it corresponds to. These values are defined as macros in a system header file (). By default, ports are driven at the tile's reference clock. However, clock block resources can be used to provide different clock signals, either by dividing the reference clock, or based on an external signal. Ports can be further configured to use buffering and to synchronise with other ports. This configuration is performed using library functions. Port events Ports can generate events, which can be handled in select statements. For example, the statement: select { case p when pinseq(v) :> void: printf(\\"Received input %d \\", v); break; } uses the predicate to wait for the value on the port to equal before triggering the response to print a notification. Port timing To be able to control when outputs on a port occur with respect to the port's clock, outputs can be timestamped or timed. The timestamped statement: p <: v @ count; causes the value to be output on the port and for to be set to the value of the port's counter (incremented by one each reference clock cycle). The timed output statement: p @ count <: v; causes the port to wait until its counter reaches the value of before the value is output. =Multiplexing tasks onto cores= By default, each task maps to one core on a tile. Because the number of cores is limited (eight in current XCore devices), XC provides two ways to map multiple tasks to cores and better exploit the available cores. Server tasks that are composed of a never-ending loop containing a select statement can be marked as combinable with the attribute . This allows the compiler to combine two or more combinable tasks to run on the same core, by merging the cases into a single select. Tasks of the same form as combinable ones, except that each case of the select handles a transaction function, can be marked with the attribute . This allows the compiler to convert the select cases into local function calls. =Memory access= XC has two models of memory access: safe and unsafe. Safe access is the default in which checks are made to ensure that: * memory accesses do not occur outside of their bounds; * memory aliases are not created; * dangling pointers are not created. These guarantees are achieved through a combination of a different kinds of pointers (restricted, aliasing, movable), static checking during compilation and run-time checks. Unsafe pointers provide the same behaviour as pointers in C. An unsafe pointer must be declared with the keyword, and they can only be used within } regions. =Additional features= References XC provides references, that are similar to those in C++ and are specified with the symbol after the type. A reference provides another name for an existing variable, such that reading and writing it is the same as reading and writing the original variable. References can refer to elements of an array or structure and can be used as parameters to regular and transaction functions. Nullable types Resource types such as interfaces, channel ends, ports and clocks must always have a valid value. The nullable qualifier allows these types to have no value, which is specified with the symbol. For example, a nullable channel is declared with: chan ?c; Nullable resource types can also be used to implement optional resource arguments for functions. The builtin function can be used to check if a resource is null. Multiple returns In XC, functions can return multiple values. For example, the following function implements the swap operation: {int, int} swap(int a, int b) { return {b, a}; } The function swap is called with a multiple assignment: {x, y} = swap(x, y); Example programs =Multicore Hello World= #include #include void hello(int id, chanend cin, chanend cout){ if (id > 0) cin :> int; printf(\\"Hello from core %d!\\", id); if (id < 3) cout <: 1; } int main(void) { chan c[3]; par (int i=0; i<4; i++) on tile[i] : hello(i, c[i], c[(i+1)%4]); return 0; } Historical influences The design of XC was heavily influenced by the occam programming language, which first introduced channel communication, alternation, ports and timers. Occam was developed by David May and built on the Communicating Sequential Processes formalism, a process algebra developed by Tony Hoare.

The film stars Peter Finch, Kim Novak (in multiple roles), Ernest Borgnine, Michael Murphy, and Valentina Cortese. The film was based on a 1962 DuPont Show of the Week TV drama co- written by Wild in the Streets creator Robert Thom. A satire on Hollywood, full of references to similar films, it recounts how an untalented beginner is hired to play the legendary Lylah Clare, a tempestuous actress who died mysteriously 20 years ago, and is herself consumed by the system. Although Aldrich's previous 1960s efforts were praised by critics, Lylah Clare opened to negative reviews. Original TV drama The Legend of Lylah Clare originally aired as a teleplay on the anthology series The DuPont Show of the Week on May 19, 1963, with Tuesday Weld in the title role and Alfred Drake as Lylah's director widower.MacMinn, Aleene (April 17, 1963) \\"Camera Angles: Corey Released From 'Eleventh Hour' Role\\" Los Angeles Times p.c15 The show was made by the Directors Company, a production company formed by Franklin Schaffner and Fielder Cook to make some of the Dupont Dramas.

He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan (Peter Finch), who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean (Ernest Borgnine), who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood, such as malicious journalist Molly Luther (Coral Browne) and lesbian admirer, acting coach Rossella (Rossella Falk). As filming continues, her identification with her role gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah, whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella. A final sequence - in this case, a TV commercial for dog food that interrupts the film itself - suggests that the world of Hollywood is literally one of dog eats dog.

In 1972, Aldrich said \\"I think there are a number of faults with\\" the film. \\"I was about to bum rap Kim Novak, when we were talking about this the other day, and then I realized that would be pretty unfair. Because people forget that Novak can act. I really didn't do her justice. But there are some stars whose motion picture image is so firmly and deeply rooted in the public's mind that an audience comes to a movie with a pre-conception about that person. And that pre-conception makes \\"reality\\" or any kind of myth that's contrary to their pre-conceived reality impossible. To make this picture work, to make LYLAH work, you had to be carried along into that myth. And we didn't accomplish that. [...]You can blame it on a lot of things, but I'm the producer and I'm the director. I'm responsible for not communicating that to the audience.

The only known work of Bulstrode‚Äôs is News of My Morning Work, probably written in 1609. While at court, Bulstrode became the topic of scandalous rumour. She had a brief courtship, and possible engagement, with Sir John Roe in 1602. The reason for their breakup is unknown, but in To Mistress Boulsted, 1602 an elegy ghost-written for Roe by his friend Ben Jonson, Bulstrode seems accused of sluttish behavior: ::::Shall I go force an elegy? abuse ::::My wit, and break the hymen of my Muse ::::For one poor hour‚Äôs love?... ::::I‚Äôll have a Succuba as good as you! ::::::-An Elegy to Mistress Boulsted, 1602 lines 1-3, 24 This poem circulated at court as a letter to Bulstrode from \\"J.R.\\" presumably John Roe. The poem takes the viewpoint of a man who rejects the advances of his female friend because he doesn‚Äôt want to ruin their friendship \\"for one poor hour‚Äôs love.\\" Although the speaker claims to be a sincere friend who will keep the poem secret to protect her reputation, the poem was not kept secret and was most likely an attempt to ruin Bulstrode's reputation and allege, according to Donald Foster, ‚Äúthat Boulstred solicited Roe for sex, which caused him to reject her as unfit for marriage.‚Äù In 1628, Ben Jonson revealed that he actually ghostwrote this poem for Roe. Boulstred eventually started a relationship with Sir Thomas Roe, Sir John Roe's cousin. This relationship most likely would have led to marriage if she had not become very sick in 1609. In 1609 over a few months, Bulstrode fell ill and died. Her illness was diagnosed by doctors of the College of Medicine as \\"the mother\\" also called the \\"wandering womb\\", an imprecise diagnosis for ailments thought to attend upon feminine frailty. Her symptoms included stomach pain, sleeplessness, fever, and vomiting. No cure could be found, and she wasted away at the countess of Bedford‚Äôs house, Twickenham Park,John Bruce, Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke (Camden Society, London, 1858), p. 18. unable to hold down food or liquids. In a letter to Sir Henry Goodyere, John Donne reported on her condition; > \\"I fear earnestly that Mistress Boulstred will not escape that sickness in > which she labors at this time. I sent this morning to ask of her passage of > this night; and the return is, that she is as I left her yesternight... [I] > fear that she will scare last so long as that you, when you receive this > letter, may do her any good office in praying for her.‚Äù According to Dr. Francis Anthony, who was called upon by Bulstrode's mother after treatment under the College of Medicine physicians was unsuccessful, she showed improvement in symptoms in her final days, \\"for in all the other administering of this medicine ... her spirits were relieved! She daily recovered strength. All passions, symptoms, and accidents of disease ceased. Her sickness fully left her, and she recovered perfect health!\\" But in regard to her ‚Äúperfect health,‚Äù Anthony exaggerated. Although he gave her doses of potable gold in an attempt to cure her, Bulstrode died within days. As Jongsook Lee puts it, Anthony was \\"a quack.\\"Lee, Jongsook. 'Who Is Cecilia, What Was She? Cecilia Bulstrode and Jonson's Epideictics', The Journal of English and Germanic Philology 85.1 (1986), pp. 20‚Äì34. Bulstrode's brother in- law, James Whitlocke noted her death, ‚ÄúCecill Bulstrode, my wife‚Äôs sister, gentlewoman to Queen An, ordinary of her bedchamber, died at Twitnam in Middlesex, the erl of Bedford‚Äôs house, 4 August 1609‚Äù, and she was buried at St Mary's, Twickenham two days later.John Bruce, Liber Famelicus of Sir James Whitelocke (Camden Society, London, 1858), p. 18. Although Sir Thomas Roe missed his chance to marry Bulstrode, his love for her remained, and he carried a miniature watercolour portrait of her around with him for the rest of his life, even after he married. In death, Bulstrode's body became a theme of court poets who competed for the literary matronage of her Lucy Russell, countess of Bedford.Claude J. Summers, 'Donne's 1609 Sequence of Grief and Comfort', Studies in Philology, 89:2 (Spring 1992), pp. 211-231. Lucy Russell's favour was highly valued, as she had a large amount of power and leverage at court as first Lady of the Queen's Bedchamber. Literary References =Sir John Roe= The poems True Love Finds Wit and An Elegy to Mistress Boulstred have been attributed to Sir John Roe. The former describes Bulstrode as a ‚ÄúWench at Court.‚Äù Ben Jonson claimed authorship of the latter in his play The New Inn in 1628/9. =Ben Jonson= Jonson continued to write about Bulstrode, most of it of a slanderous nature. In 1603/4, Jonson and Roe were kicked out of a masque at Hampton Court, an instance which Jonson blamed Bulstrode for and wrote about in his play The New Inn (1628/9). The most well- known of his literary jabs at Bulstrode is his Epigram on the Court Pucell which has been called a \\"disturbingly ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô attack on a woman.\\" Jonson supposedly wrote this poem as a response to a criticism she made of his play draft Epicoene: the Silent Woman. He claimed that his epigram was stolen out of his pocket when he was drunk and given to Bulstrode, which he had not wanted to happen.Evans, Robert C. \\"Ben Jonson (11 June 1572?-August 1637).\\" Seventeenth-Century British Nondramatic Poets: First Series. Ed. M. Thomas Hester. Vol. 121. Detroit: Gale, 1992. 186-212. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 121. Dictionary of Literary Biography Complete Online. Web. 16 Feb. 2016. Regarding the title of the poem, \\"pucell\\" was the early modern term for prostitute, and \\"Cell\\" or \\"Sell\\" as short form for \\"Cecily\\", so Jonson seems to be calling Bulstrode a prostitute in this poem. He also accuses her of being promiscuous, bisexual, pretentious, hypocritical, and more. His accusation of bisexuality stems from her close relationship with Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. However, another reading of the poem is that rather than a direct criticism of Bulstrode, the work was intended to evoke a \\"generic court pucelle\\", and by that means, an image of the false world. In another reading, the poem is a representation of Jonson's frustration with having to rely on women, like the countess of Bedford, for literary success. Lucy Russell was the matron of many writers, such as John Donne, and Jonson attempted to gain her matronage for many years. Jonson may have been frustrated by this apparent \\"inversion of traditional gender codes\\", so he used the \\"trope of prostitution\\" to reassert his position of power as a male. Another work in which Jonson wrote about Bulstrode was the Epitaph on Cecilia Bulstrode in response to her death. This poem paints a very different picture of Bulstrode. In fact, it seems to retract each of the charges made in the epigram point by point. Jonson calls her a virgin, the fourth Grace, a teacher to language to Pallas and modesty to Cynthia, conscientious, and good. Jonson seems to have written the poem for George Garrard.HMC 2nd Report (Bromley- Davenport) (London, 1874), p. 79. The reason behind Jonson's supposed change of heart is unknown. The likely reason is that he wanted to gain the favor of Lucy Russell, which he had been attempting to do for years. However, another explanation could be that he experienced true regret for his slanderous words after hearing of her painful death. =John Donne= John Donne was under the matronage of Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, during the time that Bulstrode fell ill and died. He visited her when she was sick at Twickenham Park and concluded that she was suffering from hysteria. After she died, he wrote two poems in her honour, Elegy on Mistress Boulstred and Elegy Upon the Death of Mistress Boulstred. The former poem characterizes Death as an \\"all-consuming glutton who swallows the good\\" and argues that Bulstrode was one of the good.John Carey, John Donne: The Major Works (Oxford, 1990), pp. 183-185. The latter poem says that Death is no longer needed because Bulstrode was the epitome of virtue, and now that she is dead, it is as if the entire world is dead.John Carey, John Donne: The Major Works (Oxford, 1990), pp. 185-186. Donne may have written these elegies in the hope of getting a reward from his literary matron Lucy Russell. Donne's first Elegy for Bulstrode, opens with the image that Death's table is set with animals, vegetables, and the Human race, all alike; > Death I recant, and say, unsaid by me > Whate'er hath slipped, that might diminish thee. > Spiritual treason, atheism 'tis, to say, > That any can thy summons disobey. > Th'earth's race is but thy table; there are set > Plants, cattle, men, dishes for Death to eat. > In a rude hunger now he millions draws > Into his bloody, or plaguey, or starved jaws. > Now he will seem to spare, and doth more waste, > Eating the best first, well preserved to last.John Carey, John Donne: The > Major Works (Oxford, 1990), pp. 183. Donne's second Elegy addresses Sorrow personified, Bulstrode in life was a gem, clear and pure like a blue sapphire; > Sorrow, to whom we owe all that we be, > Tyrant, in the fifth and greatest monarchy, > Was't, that she did possess all hearts before, > Thou hast killed her, to make thy empire more? > Knew'st thou some would, that knew her not, lament, > As in a deluge perish th'innocent? > Was't not enough to have that palace won, > But thou must raze it too, that was undone? > Hadst thou stayed there, and looked out at her eyes, > All had adored thee that now from thee flies, > For they let out more light, than they took in, > They told not when, but did the day begin; > She was too sapphirine, and clear for thee; > Clay, flint, and jet now thy fit dwellings be; > Alas, she was too pure, but not too weak; > Whoe'er saw crystal ordinance but would break?John Carey, John Donne: The > Major Works (Oxford, 1990), p.185. =Lucy Russell= The countess of Bedford wrote Elegy on Mistress Boulstred in response to Donne's first elegy characterizing Death as a gluttonous monster. In the poem, she refers to Donne's Holy Sonnet 10, which starts with the famous line, \\"Death be not proud\\".\\"Lucy Russell-Harington, Countess of Bedford, 'Death be not proud'\\", Early Modern Women Research Network Russell argues that Donne's interpretation of Death was more accurate in the Holy Sonnet than in his elegy. Death is something that should not be proud, and that Donne's elegy gave Death too much credit. As a Christian, Bulstrode went to Heaven when she died, and Donne did not give her enough credit when he characterized her as a helpless victim of Death in his elegy. Perhaps responding to this criticism, Donne's second elegy focusses on Bulstrode's virtues instead of on Death. Bedford's Elegy has an image of Bulstrode's breast as a crystal palace and the repository of her soul, clearer than the crystal; > From out the Christall Pallace of her brest > The clearer soule was call'd to endlesse rest.Michelle O'Callaghan, 'Lucy > Russell: British Library Harley 4064', Early Modern Women Research Network. =Sir Edward Herbert= Sir Edward Herbert was a friend of Jonson's as well as Sir Thomas and Sir John Roe. In July 1609 he commemorated Bulstrode's death with theEpitaph. Caecil. Boulser. Though the full Latin title of the poem implies that Bulstrode died with an \\"unquiet spirit and conscience\\", the poem itself characterizes her as a highly religious virgin who resisted all sin up until her \\"noble soul\\" entered Heaven. Like others, Herbert in his commemoration was most likely trying to win Russell's support. Herbert fought over the hair-ribbon of Mary Middlemore, one of Bulstrode's companions at court in December 1609,Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 296. and in 1611 became involved with Bulstrode's sister Dorothy Bulstrode, driving her husband Sir John Eyre to assault him. Works News of My Morning Work is the only known work credited to Bulstrode, though scholar John Considine says \\"more ... by her may lie undiscovered\\". In this \\"witty piece\\", Bulstrode utilizes the satirical news form then common that \\"flourished\\" in Russell's circle from 1605-1610. As per the genre, News of My Morning Work consists of a list of moral and satirical aphorisms. Several of them are humorous criticisms of court and of people who claim to be religious: :::THAT to be good, the way is to be most alone‚Äîor the best accompanied. :::That the way to Heaven is mistaken for the most melancholy walk. :::That the most fear of the world‚Äôs opinion more than God‚Äôs displeasure. :::That a Court-friend seldom goes further than the first degree of charity. :::That the Devil is the perfect courtier. :::::: -News of My Morning Work lines 1-5 Toward the end she writes: \\"That a man with a female wit is the worst hermaphrodite\\". This is perhaps the most memorable line, and has been interpreted by many as a jab at Ben Jonson, who \\"had a career-long interest in hermaphroditism\\" according to Foster and Banton, as evident in his works Cynthia‚Äôs Revels, Volpone, and Epicoene. However, not all agree, Robert W. Halli, Jr. points out that this is only one line of many that is being unfairly singled out and misinterpreted.Halli, Robert W., Jr. \\"Cecilia Bulstrode, 'The Court Pucell'.\\" Subjects on the World's Stage: Essays on British Literature of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. 295-312. Newark: U of Delaware P, 1995. MLA International Bibliography. Web. 20 Apr. 2016. For Victoria E. White, ‚Äúhow this [line] is‚Äù immediately ‚Äúrelevant to Jonson is not apparent.\\" News of My Morning Work was likely written around 1609, but did not rise to prominence until it was published amongst other short pieces as a supplement to Sir Thomas Overbury‚Äôs A Wife in 1615, which became \\"an instant bestseller.\\" Overbury's poem was published along with News articles such as Bulstrode's after it was discovered that Overbury had been murdered by the woman he wrote the poem about, making the publication a huge hit. A line in Jonson's Epigram on the Court Pucell reads, \\"And in an Epicoene fury can write News / Equal with that which for the best News goes\\", which may imply that the News articles published with Overbury's poem were written by Bulstrode's friends and that News of My Morning Work was written by Bulstrode. Some contributions were written by Benjamin Rudyerd, and Bulstrode's appears to be a response to his News from My Lodging.Julie Crawford, Mediatrix: Women, Politics, and Literary Production in Early Modern England (Oxford, 2018), pp. 148-9: Peter Redford, The Burley Manuscript (Manchester, 2017), pp. 53-4. The publication itself only identifies the author of News of my Morning Work as a \\"Mris B.\\" According to Price, Bulstrode wrote the piece in the style conforming to what Halli calls \\"a precise formula, which includes a declarative beginning, a series of noun clauses, conceited similes and metaphors, and an effective concluding praise.\\" References * Text of Newes of my Morning Work from Early English Books Online * Cecilia Bulstrode, from The Twickenham Museum * Sir Edward Herbert's Epitaph for Cecily Bulstrode, Early English Books online * John Donne, 'Elegy on Mistress Boulstred'.

Life He was born at Florence on 10 May 1823, was second son of General Robert Ellice, the brother of the Right Hon. Edward Ellice, secretary at war, and Eliza Courtney. Military career Having passed through Sandhurst, Charles Ellice was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards on 10 May 1839. He served in Canada in 1840-2, and became lieutenant and captain on 8 August 1845. He exchanged to the 82nd foot on 20 March 1846, and to the 24th foot, of which his father was colonel, on 3 April. He went with that regiment to India in May, but was aide-de-camp to his father (commanding the troops in Malta) from 17 March 1848 to 3 March 1849, and so missed the second Sikh war. He was promoted major on 21 December 1849, and lieutenant-colonel on 8 August 1851. On 28 November 1854 he became colonel in the army. The 24th was at Peshawar when the Indian Mutiny broke out. On 4 July 1857, Ellice was sent to Jhelum with three companies of it, some native cavalry, and three guns, to disarm the 14th Bengal native infantry and other troops. He arrived rode ahead to discuss the disarming of the garrison with their British Commander and made preparation for it to be carried out the following day whilst the 14th Bengal Native Infantry were on parade. The 14th mutinied on sighting Ellice's forces on the morning of the 7th and he attacked and routed them during what became known as the Battle of Jhelum. He was dangerously wounded in the neck, right shoulder, and leg leading a charge to break through the enemy lines. He was mentioned in despatches, received the medal, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1858. On 3 June 1858, he was given the command of the second battalion of the 24th, which he raised. He went with it to Mauritius in March 1860, but exchanged to half-pay on 8 July 1862. On 25 May 1863, he was appointed to a brigade in the Dublin district; on 8 March 1864 he was transferred to Dover and from 1 September 1867 to 30 June 1868 he commanded the South-Eastern District. He was promoted major-general on 23 March 1865, lieutenant-general on 28 September 1873, and general on 1 October 1877. He went on to become Quartermaster-General to the Forces in 1871, and in 1876 was appointed Adjutant-General to the Forces. In this role he advised the Government that the defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana of 1879 had arisen because they had underestimated the military capability of the Zulus.Zulu Victory: The Epic of Isandlwana and the Cover-up by Ron Lock and Peter Quantrill, Greenhill Books, 2005, In the latter capacity, he carried on a correspondence in 1877-8 with the governors of Wellington College, in which he represented the view of many officers of the army that the college was being diverted from its original purpose. The correspondence was published, and a commission of inquiry followed. He left the post of Adjutant-General in 1882, and retired in 1887. He was also Colonel of the 49th (Princess of Wales Hertfordshire) Regiment (1874‚Äì1881) and the South Wales Borderers from 6 April 1884 until his death in 1888. He lived at 12 South Audley Street in London.Survey of London: volume 40 - The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 2 (The Buildings) British History on Line He died at Brook House, Horringer, Bury St Edmunds on 12 November 1888.

Wolf Rd. in Burr Ridge, Illinois. Built in 1856, the house is the oldest in Burr Ridge and the only example of an early farmhouse in the community. The house was designed in the upright-and-wing form of the Greek Revival style and also features elements of the Italianate and Classical Revival styles. The two-story house has a front gable and a -story side wing. The house's main entrance is bordered by sidelights and a transom and framed by pilasters supporting a plain pediment. The front of the house has five six-over-six wood sash windows with wooden shutters. The wing has a front porch with a sloping overhang supported by columns. The house's main eave features ornamental Italianate brackets. Robert Vial was the second son of Joseph Vial, an early settler of Lyons Township who was also the area's first postmaster and a founder of Lyonsville Congregational Church. Robert built the house for himself in 1856. He operated one of the largest farms in the area, and his farms had the first silo constructed in Cook County. Vial also served as a school director, township supervisor and treasurer of schools and as deacon of the Lyonsville Congregational Church, as had his father before him. After Robert Vial's death, his children converted his farm to a golf course, and the farmhouse became the course's clubhouse (both are gone now, having been converted into a housing development in what is now Western Springs, Illinois).

He married Mary Say, by whom he had one daughter, Anne, who became his heir. Family Bourchier was the son of William Bourchier, Viscount Bourchier and Anne Woodville. Through his mother, he was the nephew of Elizabeth Woodville, queen consort to Edward IV. He inherited the titles of 2nd Earl of Essex, 6th Baron Bourchier, 3rd Count of Eu and 2nd Viscount Bourchier from his grandfather Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex on his death in 1483. He married twice, about 1512 to Mary Say(e) (1474-1535), then about 1536 to Mary Blount (1498-1555). Career Bourchier was a member of Henry VII's privy council. He was present at the Siege of Boulogne in 1492 and five years later led a detachment against the rebels at Blackheath. When Henry VIII became king, he was made captain of the new bodyguard. In 1513, he commanded the cavalry vanguard at the Battle of the Spurs, where he ordered the charge which routed the French gendarmes. As Lieutenant-general of the Spears, he was subsequently present at the sieges of Terouanne and Tournai and was appointed Chief Captain of the King's forces the following year. in 1520 he was part of King Henry's entourage when he met in France with the French king at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, where he carried the Sword of State. He was one of the judges at the trial in 1521 of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, when the latter was tried on a charge of treason. Bourchier received the manor of Bedminster as his share of the Duke's forfeited estates.

Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian speech and language therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast upon Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939. Seidler read about George VI's life after learning to manage a stuttering condition he developed during his own youth. He started writing about the relationship between the therapist and his royal patient as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King's widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, postponed work until her death in 2002. He later rewrote his screenplay for the stage to focus on the essential relationship between the two protagonists. Nine weeks before filming began, Logue's notebooks were discovered and quotations from them were incorporated into the script. Principal photography took place in London and around Britain from November 2009 to January 2010. Hard light was used to give the story a greater resonance and wider-than-normal lenses were employed to recreate the Duke of York's feelings of constriction. A third technique Hooper employed was the off-centre framing of characters. The King's Speech was a major box office and critical success. It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, screenplay, directing, score, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance, which resulted in his first Oscar win for Best Actor. At the 83rd Academy Awards, The King's Speech received 12 Oscar nominations, more than any other film in that year, and subsequently won four, including Best Picture. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers and distributors in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of ¬£8 million, it earned over ¬£250 million ($400 million) internationally. all US Dollar-Sterling currency conversions were made using an exchange rate of $1=¬£0.60 Plot At the official closing of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, Prince Albert, Duke of York, the second son of King George V, addresses the crowd with a strong stammer. His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife, Elizabeth, persuades him to see the Australian- born Lionel Logue, a non-medically trained Harley Street speech defects therapist. \\"Bertie\\", as he is called by his family, believes the first session is not going well, but Lionel, who insists that all his patients address him as such, has his potential client recite Hamlet's \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy while hearing classical music played on a pair of headphones. Bertie is frustrated at the experiment but Lionel gives him the acetate recording that he has made of the reading as a souvenir. After Bertie's father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 Royal Christmas Message, he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Bertie's brother's neglect of his responsibilities make training in it necessary. The attempt at reading the message himself is a failure, but that night Bertie plays the recording Lionel gave him and is astonished at the lack of stutter there. He therefore returns for daily treatments to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his speaking difficulty. George V dies in 1936, and his eldest son David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII. A constitutional crisis arises with the new king over a prospective marriage with the twice- divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. Edward, as head of the Church of England, cannot marry her, even if she receives her second divorce, since both her previous husbands are alive. At an unscheduled session, Bertie expresses his frustration that, while his speech has improved when speaking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David, at the same time revealing the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie himself could make a good king, Bertie accuses Lionel of speaking treason and quits Lionel in anger. Bertie must now face the Accession Council without any assistance. Bertie and Lionel only come together again after King Edward decides to abdicate in order to marry. Bertie, urged ahead by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, ascends the throne as King George VI and visits Lionel's home with his wife before their coronation, much to the surprise of Mrs. Logue when she comes upon Queen Elizabeth having tea at her dining room table. This is the first time that she learns who her husband's patient has been. Bertie and Lionel's relationship is questioned by the King's advisors during the preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang, brings to light that George never asked for advice from his advisors about his treatment and that Lionel has never had formal training. Lionel explains to an outraged Bertie that at the time he started with speech defects there were no formal qualifications and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shell- shocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience. Bertie remains unconvinced until provoked to protest at Lionel's disrespect for King Edward's Chair and the Stone of Scone. Only at this pivotal moment, after realising he has just expressed himself without impediment, is Bertie able to rehearse with Lionel and complete the ceremony. As the new king, Bertie is in a crisis when he must broadcast to Britain and the Empire following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany in 1939. Lionel is summoned to Buckingham Palace to prepare the king for his speech. Knowing the challenge that lies before him, Lang, Winston Churchill, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain are present to offer support. The King and Logue are then left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, but by the end he is speaking freely. Preparing to leave the room for the congratulations of those present, Logue mentions to the King that he still has difficulty enunciating w and the King jokes back, \\"I had to throw in a few so they'd know it was me.\\" As the Royal Family step onto the palace balcony and are applauded by the crowd, a title card explains that Logue, who received the Royal Victorian Order for service to the Crown, was always present at King George VI's speeches during the war and that they remained friends until the King's death from lung cancer in 1952.

King George VI's success in overcoming his stammer inspired the young Seidler, \\"Here was a stutterer who was a king and had to give radio speeches where everyone was listening to every syllable he uttered, and yet did so with passion and intensity.\\" When Seidler became an adult, he resolved to write about King George VI. During the late 1970s and 1980s he voraciously researched the King, but found a dearth of information on Logue. Eventually Seidler contacted Valentine Logue, who agreed to discuss his father and make his notebooks available if the Queen Mother gave her permission. She asked him not to do so in her lifetime, and Seidler halted the project. 261x261px The Queen Mother died in 2002. Three years later, Seidler returned to the story during a bout of creative work inspired by a recovery from cancer. His research, including a chance encounter with an uncle whom Logue had treated, indicated he used mechanical breathing exercises combined with psychological counselling to probe the underlying causes of the condition. Thus prepared, Seidler imagined the sessions. He showed the finished screenplay to his wife, who liked it, but pronounced it too \\"seduced by cinematic technique\\". She suggested he rewrite it as a stage play to focus on the essential relationship between the King and Logue. After he had completed it, he sent it to a few friends who worked in theatre in London and New York for feedback. In 2005, Joan Lane of Wilde Thyme, a production company in London, received the script. Lane started talking with Simon Egan and Gareth Unwin of Bedlam Productions, and they invited Seidler to London to rewrite the play again, this time for the screen. Together, Lane and Bedlam Productions organised a reading of the play in Pleasance Theatre, a small house in north London, to a group of Australian expatriates, among whom was Tom Hooper's mother. She called her son and said, \\"I've found your next project\\".Gritten, D. (23 December 2010). \\"Tom Hooper Interview for the King's Speech\\". The Daily Telegraph.

Instead of trying to contact his agent, Lane asked an Australian staff member to hand-deliver the script to Geoffrey Rush's house, not far away from hers in Melbourne. Unwin reports that he received a four-page e-mail from Rush's manager admonishing them for the breach of etiquette, but ending with an invitation to discuss the project further. Iain Canning from See-Saw Films became involved and, in Gareth Unwin's words: \\"We worked with ex-chair of BAFTA Richard Price, and started turning this story about two grumpy men sitting in a room into something bigger.\\" Hooper liked the story, but thought that the original ending needed to be changed to reflect events more closely: \\"Originally, it had a Hollywood ending ... If you hear the real speech, he's clearly coping with his stammer. But it's not a perfect performance. He's managing it.\\" BAFTA and an Academy Award, among other accolades296x296px The production team learnedsome nine weeks prior to the start of filmingof a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke.\\"Finding the real King's Speech\\". BBC. 4 January 2011. Retrieved 8 January 2011. They then went back and re-worked the script to reflect what was in the notes. Hooper said some of the film's most memorable lines, such as at the climax, when Logue smiles and says, \\"You still stammered on the W\\" to the King, who replies, \\"I had to throw in a few so they would know it was me\\" were direct quotations from Logue's notes. Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery. Seidler thought Paul Bettany would be a good choice to play King George VI, while Hooper preferred Hugh Grant, though both actors refused the offer. Once they met with Firth and heard him read for the part, Seidler and Hooper were convinced of his suitability for the role. The UK Film Council awarded the production ¬£1 million in June 2009. Filming began in December 2009, and lasted 39 days. Most was shot in the three weeks before Christmas because Rush would be performing in a play in January. The schedule was further complicated by Bonham Carter's availability: she worked on Harry Potter during the week, so her scenes had to be filmed during the weekend. = Location and design = Period dramas rely to an extent on the quality of production, so combining regal opulence with scruffy, depression-era London on the relatively limited ¬£8 million budget presented a challenge. On 25 November 2009 the crew took over the Pullens buildings in Southwark. To emphasise Logue's humble background, the entire street was transformed into one from 1930s London. Large advertisements for (among other things) Bovril and fascism were added to walls, grit and grime to streets and buildings. To reproduce London smog of the timethick enough that cars might need guidance from someone walking aheadso much artificial smoke was used that fire alarms were triggered. On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush, and Jacobi began at Ely Cathedral, the location used for Westminster Abbey. The production had asked for permission to film in the Abbey but were denied due to the demands of tourism. Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed them to build sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it. Lancaster House, an opulent government-owned period house in London, was rented (at ¬£20,000 per day) for interior scenes of Buckingham Palace.Bedell, G.

The 1936 Accession Council at St. James's Palace, where George VI swore an oath, was filmed in the Livery Hall of Drapers' Hall. The room, ornate and vast, met the occasion: the daunting nature of the new King's responsibilities was shown by surrounding him with rich detail, flags and royal portraiture.\\"The King‚Äôs Speech film locations\\" . www.movielocations.com. Retrieved 4 August 2011. The crew investigated Logue's former consultation rooms, but they were too small to film in. Instead, they found a high, vaulted room not far away in 33 Portland Place. Eve Stewart, the production designer, liked the mottled, peeling wallpaper there so much that she recreated the effect throughout the entire room. In his DVD commentary, Hooper said he liked Portland Place as a set because it felt \\"lived in\\", unlike other period houses in London. The scenes of the Duke of York at home with his family were also filmed here; showing the Prince living in a townhouse \\"subverted\\" expectations of a royal drama. The Pullens buildings with a 1930s advertisement The opening scene, set at the closing ceremony of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, was filmed on location at Elland Road, home of Leeds United, and Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford RLFC. Elland Road was used for the speech elements of the prince stammering his way through his first public address, and Odsal Stadium was selected because of the resemblance of its curved ends to Wembley Stadium in 1925. The crew had access to the stadium only at 10 pm, after a football game. They filled the terraces with inflatable dummies and over 250 extras dressed in period costumes. Live actors were interspersed to give the impression of a crowd. Additional people, as well as more ranks of soldiers on the pitch, were added in post-production with visual effects. Other locations include Cumberland Lodge, Harley Street, Knebworth, Hatfield House, the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Queen Street Mill Textile Museum in Burnley, and Battersea Power Station, which doubled as a BBC wireless control room. The final cut of the film was completed on 31 August 2010. = Dialogue = In developing his portrayal of George VI's stammer, Firth worked with Neil Swain, the voice coach for the film. His sister, Kate Firth, also a professional voice coach to actors, proposed exercises the King might have done with Logue, and made suggestions on how to imagine Logue's mix of physical and psychological coaching for the film. In addition, Firth watched archive footage of the King speaking. In an interview with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: \\"[It] was very interesting while we were working on the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [Hooper] ‚Äì and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [Firth] ‚Äì might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did.\\" In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: \\"You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it‚Äôs quite infectious. You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it‚Äôs an insight into what it feels like.\\"Ward, Victoria (5 May 2011). \\"Colin Firth admits he is struggling to lose his stutter\\". The Daily Telegraph. Retrieved 21 July 2011.  Soundtrack  The film's original score was composed by Alexandre Desplat. In a film about a man struggling to articulate himself, Desplat was wary of overshadowing the dramaturgy: \\"This is a film about the sound of the voice. Music has to deal with that. Music has to deal with silence. Music has to deal with time.\\"Martens, T. (26 November 2010). \\"The sound of silence: Alexandre Desplat on the music that 'just floats' throughout 'The King's Speech'\\". Pop & hiss (LA Times music blog). Retrieved 9 February 2011. The score is a sparse arrangement of strings and piano (with the addition of oboe and harp in one cut), intended to convey the sadness of the King's muteness, and then the growing warmth of friendship between him and Logue. The minimalist approach emphasises the protagonist's struggle for control.McNab, K. (27 January 2011). \\"The King's Speech score review\\". www.soundonsight.org. Retrieved 9 February 2011. Desplat used the repetition of a single note to represent the stickiness of the King's speech. As the film progresses, growing banks of warm strings swaddle the deepening friendship between the two leads. The music rises to a climax in the coronation scene. Hooper originally wanted to film the scene without music, but Desplat argued that it was the real climax of the storythe point when the friendship was ratified by their decision to trust each other. \\"That is really rare\\", said Desplat, \\"mostly you have love stories\\". To create a dated sound, the score was recorded on old microphones extracted from the EMI archives which had been specially made for the royal family. The music played during the broadcast of the 1939 radio speech at the climax of the film is from the 2nd movement (Allegretto) of Beethoven's 7th Symphony; it was added by Tariq Anwar, the editor. When Desplat later joined the team to write the music, he praised and defended Anwar's suggestion. Hooper further remarked that the stature of the piece helps elevate the status of the speech to a public event.Hooper, Tom (21 January 2011). \\"The King's Speech director Tom Hooper answers your questions ‚Äì live!\\".

The score also won a Grammy at the 54th Grammy Awards. =Track listing= Visual style Tom Hooper operating a camera on location at Queen Street Mill Textile Museum, Lancashire Hooper employed a number of cinematic techniques to evoke the King's feelings of constriction. He and cinematographer Danny Cohen used wider than normal lenses to photograph the film, typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm, where the subtle distortion of the picture helps to convey the King's discomfort.Appelo, T. (31 January 2011). \\"The 5 Secrets of Tom Hooper‚Äôs ‚ÄòKing‚Äôs Speech‚Äô Success\\". The Hollywood Reporter.

American Cinematographer (American Society of Cinematographers) 91 (12): pp. 18‚Äì22. For instance, the subjective point of view shot during the Empire exhibition speech used a close up of the microphone with a wider lens, similar to the filming technique used for one of the Duke's early consultations with a physician. In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that the feeling of entrapment inside the King's head was rendered overly literal with what she believed to be a fisheye lens, though in these scenes the wider lenses were used. Hooper also discussed using the 18mm lens, one he likes \\"because it puts human beings in their context\\". Roger Ebert noted that the majority of the film was shot indoors, where oblong sets, corridors, and small spaces manifest constriction and tightness, in contrast to the usual emphasis on sweep and majesty in historical dramas. Hooper used wide shots to capture the actors' body language, particularly that of Geoffrey Rush, who trained at L'√âcole Internationale de Th√©√¢tre Jacques Lecoq in Paris and \\"is consequently brilliant in the way he carries his body\\". Hooper widened his scope first to capture Rush's gestures, then full body movements and silhouettes. The approach carried over to Firth as well. In the first consultation scene, the Duke is squeezed against the end of a long couch framed against a large wall, \\"as if to use the arm of the sofa as a kind of friend, as a security blanket?\\" Martin Filler praised the \\"low-wattage\\" cinematography of Danny Cohen's, as making everything look like it has been \\"steeped in strong tea\\".Filler, M. (25 January 2011). \\"Hollywood's Royal Stammer\\". NYR Blog. Retrieved 9 February 2011. At other times, the camera was positioned very close to the actors to catch the emotion in their faces: \\"If you put a lens 6 inches from somebody's face, you get more emotion than if you're on a long lens 20 feet away,\\" Cohen said in an interview.Oppenheimer (2010:19) Hooper sought a second subtlety while filming the first consultation room scene between the two men, having placed the camera 18 inches from Colin Firth's face: \\"I wanted the nervousness of the first day to percolate into his performances,\\" he said. Historical dramas traditionally tend to use \\"soft light\\", but Hooper wanted to use a harsher glare, which gives a more contemporary feel, and thus a greater emotional resonance. To achieve the effect, the lighting team erected huge blackout tents over the Georgian buildings and used large lights filtered through Egyptian cotton.  Historical accuracy  Several events in the film did not happen, or were exaggerated. The visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 74.4% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarising: \\"Some nips and tucks of the historical record, but mostly an accurate retelling of a unique friendship\\". = Relationship with Lionel Logue = The filmmakers not only tightened the chronology of the events to just a few years but even shifted the timeline of treatment. The Duke of York actually began working with Logue in October 1926, ten years before the abdication crisis, and the improvement in his speech was apparent in months rather than years as suggested by the film. When he was dispatched to Australia to open their new Parliament House in Canberra in 1927, the Duke gave numerous speeches during the journey and performed well despite Logue not accompanying him on the trip. He wrote to Logue from the Caribbean, \\"You remember my fear of 'The King'. I give it every evening at dinner on board. This does not worry me any more.\\" And of his speech opening Parliament it was observed that he spoke \\"resonantly and without stuttering\\".Meacham, S. (10 November 2011) King's voice coach calmed a nation. Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 20 August 2011. Robert Logue, a grandson of Lionel, doubted the film's depiction of the speech therapist, stating \\"I don't think he ever swore in front of the King and he certainly never called him 'Bertie'\\". Andrew Roberts, an English historian, states that the severity of the King's stammer was exaggerated and the characters of Edward VIII, Wallis Simpson, and George V made more antagonistic than they really were, to increase the dramatic effect. =Politics = Christopher Hitchens and Isaac Chotiner have criticised the film for failing to indict the appeasement of the era or to portray Edward VIII's sympathetic attitude to Nazi Germany. The Guardian also corrected the portrayal of Stanley Baldwin as having resigned due to his refusal to order Britain's re-armament, when he in fact stepped down as \\"a national hero, exhausted by more than a decade at the top\\". Hugo Vickers, an adviser on the film, agreed that the alteration of historical details to preserve the essence of the dramatic story was sometimes necessary. The high-ranking officials, for instance, would not have been present when the King made his speech, nor would Churchill have been involved at any level, \\"but the average viewer knows who Churchill is; he doesn't know who Lord Halifax and Sir Samuel Hoare are.\\"Henley, J. (9 January 2011). \\"How historically accurate is the King's Speech?\\". The Guardian. Retrieved 3 February 2011. Hitchens and Chotiner also challenged the film's portrayal of Winston Churchill's role in the abdication crisis.Chotiner, I. (6 January 2011). \\"Royal Mess\\". The New Republic. Retrieved 9 January 2011. It is well established that Churchill encouraged Edward VIII to resist pressure to abdicate, whereas he is portrayed in the film as supportive of the Duke of York and not opposed to the abdication.For critiques of the film, see e.g., Hitchens FN 47 and Chotiner FN 44. For historical sources substantiating Churchill's stance during the abdication crisis, see e.g., Roy Jenkins's biography of Churchill (2001) and Frances Donaldson's biography of Edward VIII (1976). Hitchens attributes this treatment to the \\"cult\\" surrounding Churchill's legacy. In a smart, well-made film \\"would the true story not have been fractionally more interesting for the audience?\\", he wondered. =Realism= Martin Filler acknowledged that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, such as in the probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. Commenting on the film's final scene on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, Andrew Roberts has written, \\"The scene is fairly absurd from a historical point of viewNeville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill were not present and there were no cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace.\\" But Roberts praises the film overall as a sympathetic portrayal of the King's \\"quiet, unassuming heroism [...] The portrayals by Firth and Bonham Carter are sympathetic and acute, and the movie‚Äôs occasional factual b√™tises should not detract from that.\\"  Release  =Cinema release= The film had its world premi√®re on 6 September 2010 at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States. It was screened at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, on Firth's 50th birthday, where it received a standing ovation and won the People's Choice Award. The cinema release poster was re-designed to show an extreme close-up of Firth's jaw and a microphone after Hooper criticised the first design as a \\"train smash\\".

The episodes were originally broadcast in the United States on November 25, 1966 and December 2, 1966 on NBC. The film was directed by Joseph Sargent and written by Peter Allan Fields with the story by David Victor. It, as does the television series, stars Robert Vaughn and David McCallum. It is the fifth such feature film that used as its basis a reedited version of one or more episodes from the series. Production Unlike the four earlier feature movies, The Spy in the Green Hat made only minimal changes to the episodes. The musical cues were essentially the same, and no major scenes were added or removed. What was changed was the addition of some short scenes that are more violent, sexy, and disturbing than generally shown on American network television at the time. For example, the deaths of Luger and von Kronen are shown longer and in more detail than on television. Pia Monteri is briefly shown in the film nude from the back, but on television that portion was edited out. And Miss Diketon has lines in the film that, as enthusiastically delivered by Janet Leigh, make clear the sensual pleasure she receives from both inflicting and receiving pain. Those lines were removed for the television version. The titular \\"Spy in the Green Hat\\" is Mr. Thaler of THRUSH, played by Will Kuluva. Kuluva had previously played the head of U.N.C.L.E. as Mr. Allison in the unaired pilot for the series. His character was replaced by Leo G. Carroll as Alexander Waverly. Plot Solo and Kuryakin are assigned to infiltrate a THRUSH secret base located in a Sicillian winery. The base is run by Louis Strago, who in conjunction with former Nazi Dr. von Kronen is planning to detonate atomic bombs in the Atlantic Ocean. The bombs will cause the Gulf Stream to divert, wreaking havoc in Europe and the United States and warming Greenland sufficiently for it to become a strategic new home for THRUSH (\\"THRUSHland\\"). The agents are split up after an encounter with THRUSH, with Solo having to hide overnight in the house of Pia Monteri. When Pia's grandmother learns of this, she considers it a disgrace to her family's reputation (despite Solo's insistence that nothing inappropriate happened) and insists at the end of a shotgun that Solo marry Pia. Solo manages to escape, but Pia and her grandmother enlist the aid of Pia's uncles to find him and return him for marriage. Her uncles are the Stilleto brothers, Prohibition era gangsters in the U.S. who miss the \\"good old days\\". Solo barely escapes the wedding. Kuryakin and, ultimately, Pia are captured by Strago and taken to his island base from which the bombs will be launched. Tortured by Miss Diketon (who truly loves her work), Kuryakin is to be executed at a party held for Strago's immediate superior in THRUSH, Mr. Thaler. U.N.C.L.E. learns of the plot thanks to Solo's efforts and sends an assault force to bomb the island, killing everyone on it. With Mr. Waverly's reluctant approval, Solo attempts a rescue of Kuryakin and Pia before the bombers attack. Strago's defenses prove too much, however, and Solo finds himself allied with the Stilleto brothers - who have come to the island as well in search of Pia. Miss Diketon betrays Strago due to his dismissal of her over a minor error, and with her help U.N.C.L.E. and the Stilletos are able to stop the missile launch. Strago, Thaler, and von Kronen are killed in the process. Diketon also dies in the fight, enjoying both the physical pain she is feeling and the fact that she saw Strago's plan fail. Pia's family finally stops trying to get Solo to marry her, and the film ends with everyone enjoying an Italian dinner. Cast *Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo *David McCallum as Illya Kuryakin *Leo G.

It is the third such feature film that used as its basis a reedited version of one or more episodes from the series. In this instance, the film took the two-part episode and added in a subplot featuring Yvonne Craig as an U.N.C.L.E. operative carrying on a flirtatious relationship with Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn); Craig does not appear in the television episodes. Both episodes were written by Dean Hargrove and directed by Joseph Sargent. It also added in and substituted scenes that, while not out of place in a 1960s U.S. spy film, were more explicitly sexual than generally shown on U.S. television at the time. Whereas the earlier U.N.C.L.E. films added material to a single episode to create a feature-length movie, \\"One Spy Too Many\\" removed certain elements of the two-part episode (e.g., scenes with Alexander's parents) to allow for the added subplot with Craig and other enhanced scenes within the film's overall running time. This was the last film culled from the series to be theatrically released in the U.S. (in late 1966). Plot The film opens with Alexander (Rip Torn) stealing a chemical weapon from a military base. The weapon causes an enemy's troops to lose the will to fight, thereby making conquest in battle far easier. This is part of Alexander's dual goal: to conquer the world in the manner of Alexander the Great and to break each of the major moral codes in so doing (which essentially means the ten commandments as detailed throughout the movie). U.N.C.L.E. becomes involved after the theft of the weapon and agents Napoleon Solo (Vaughn) and Illya Kuryakin (McCallum) are assigned. Also searching for Alexander is his estranged wife Tracey (Dorothy Provine), although her motive is to serve him with divorce papers. Through a series of coincidences (and Tracey's focused efforts to trail the U.N.C.L.E agents to find her husband), Solo, Kuryakin, and Tracey end up joining forces. As a result, they are at various times captured, tortured, left to die in an elaborate way in an Egyptian tomb, and otherwise thwarted by Alexander throughout the film. Alexander believes that if he is able to assist a military junta in the takeover of a small country (implied to be Vietnam) that he can use that country as a base for world conquest. By careful planning, he combines his final violation of a commandment - killing the country's leader - with the takeover of the country and the start of his march toward global domination. Intervention by U.N.C.L.E. prevents the assassination, and during his escape Alexander is killed by his own accomplice Kavon (David Opatoshu).

Plot In 1946, after fighting in World War II, two former United States Air Force pilots in North Africa, Brynie MacKay (Rod Taylor) and Mike Brewer (Pete Duel) are forced to work for Lee Harris (Harry Guardino), an international smuggler to get money needed for their return to civilian life. The smuggler wants them to fly to France, with Egyptian cotton cargo. When Brynie finds that their real cargo is contraband cigarettes, he extorts Harris for more money. In retaliation, Harris plants narcotics on Brynie's aircraft and informs Colonel Wilson (Kevin McCarthy) at U. S. Counterintelligence. With Byrnie's aircraft impounded and his money seized, Elena (Claudia Cardinale), Harris's mistress comes to his aid. Harris exacts a promise for 12 more illegal cargo flights, but Mike warns that they will both be killed if they go ahead with this scheme. When Mike tries to trap Harris by informing Col. Wilson about the smuggling runs, Harris, who is flying with the two pilots, kills Mike, but is knocked out by Byrnie. Fearing Harris's gang is waiting for him at the prearranged destination, Byrnie lands his aircraft at an abandoned military air strip and informs Wilson where the contraband can be found. With Elena at his side, Byrnie then escapes to North Africa. When Harris tracks them down, Brynie overcomes Harris and turns him over to Wilson, and because of the deal Mike had made, is released.

In 1933‚Äì1944, he worked at the All-union Institute of Experimental Medicine in Leningrad and simultaneously at the Tajik branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (1937‚Äì1951). Yevgeny Pavlovsky held the post of the director of the Zoology Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1942‚Äì1962. In 1946, he was appointed head of the Department of Parasitology & Medical Zoology at the Institute of Epidemiology & Microbiology of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. Yevgeny Pavlovsky was the president of the Soviet Geographical Society in 1952‚Äì1964. Under Pavlovsky's direction, they organized numerous complex expeditions to the Central Asia, Transcaucasus, Crimea, Russian Far East and other regions of the Soviet Union to study endemic parasitic and transmissible diseases (tick-borne relapsing fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Pappataci fever, leishmaniasis etc.). Yevgeny Pavlovsky introduced the concept of natural nidality of human diseases, defined by the idea that microscale disease foci are determined by the entire ecosystem. This concept laid the foundation for the elaboration of a number of preventive measures and promoted the development of the environmental trend in parasitology (together with the works of parasitologist Valentin Dogel). Yevgeny Pavlovsky researched host organism as a habitat for parasites (parasitocenosis), numerous matters of regional and landscape parasitology, life cycles of a number of parasites, pathogenesis of helminth infection. Pavlovsky and his fellow scientists researched the fauna of flying blood-sucking insects (gnat) and methods of controlling them and venomous animals and characteristics of their venom. Publications and honors Evgeny Pavlovsky's principal works are dedicated to the matters of parasitology. He authored several textbooks and manuals on parasitology. Pavlovsky was a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th convocations. He was a recipient of the Stalin State Prize (1941, 1950), the Lenin Prize (1965), the Mechnikov Gold Medal of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (1949), and gold medal of the Soviet Geographical Society (1954). Yevgeny Pavlovsky was awarded five Orders of Lenin, four other orders, and numerous medals.

It is in the principal Gothic architectural style. Because of its past as a collegiate church, is also known als Coll√©giale Saint-Martin, and because of its large dimensions, as Cath√©drale Saint-Martin, although Colmar had never been the seat of a bishopric. History and description In 1972, remains were archaeologically dug out of a first church, built in Carolingian style around the year 1000. Foundations of a second church built on that spot, in Romanesque style, were found as well. The present building had been constructed between 1234 and 1365 as the church of a college devoted to the cult of Martin of Tours, and since defunct. The current, conspicuous helmet crowning the bell tower had been added in 1572 in Renaissance style after a fire. The church is surrounded by several portals of rather small dimensions, speaking relatively to the volume of the building. Some of these portals are bricked up. The largest portals display richly sculpted tympana. The coloured tile roof, reminding that of the Coll√©giale Saint-Thi√©baut in Thann, is another striking feature of the church's exterior. The massive pillars that support the fa√ßade, an architectural rarity, give the front of the building a somewhat cumbersome aspect that contrasts with the airy look of the high apse windows. Another noteworthy detail of the building's exterior, testament to the troubled History of Jews in Alsace, is the presence of two \\"Judens√§ue\\", one in the shape of a gargoyle, the other as a corner sculpture of a portal.Assall, Paul: Juden im Elsass, Elster Verlag Moos, 1984, In the spacious interior, whose furniture had suffered bitter losses during the French Revolution, the most remarkable features are the exuberant Baroque organ case of 1755, (the mechanism and the pipes themselves, originally built by Johann Andreas Silbermann, were completely replaced in 1979), as well as the ambulatory, a unique feature in Alsatian churches. The many chapels that surround the choir display several medieval altars and statues. Of the remaining Gothic stained glass windows in the nave, the most noteworthy is a 13th century head of a beardless Christ, another rare feature. =The Isenmann altarpiece= In 1462, the municipal painter Caspar Isenmann received a commission to paint a set of panels dedicated to the Life of Jesus Christ. He delivered the paintings (oil on fir wood) in 1465. In 1720, the altar was dismantled and Isenmann's paintings were dispersed. Seven surviving panels are kept since 1853 in the Unterlinden Museum.

Ted Mann arranged a distribution deal with National General, who changed the title to Sex Through a Window. The film failed commercially and Crichton took it off his filmography. According to Crichton, he \\"became interested in the idea of making an X-rated film that would also be a good movie. What happened to it was that it got shot as a soft R, and that just destroyed it. I mean it really had a hard edge that I thought was interesting, and it was a good script, but it had to be an X. The minute it was not an X, it was just all over.

Cancer can be treated by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy (including immunotherapy such as monoclonal antibody therapy) and synthetic lethality. The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient (performance status). Cancer genome sequencing helps in determining which cancer the patient exactly has for determining the best therapy for the cancer. A number of experimental cancer treatments are also under development. Under current estimates, two in five people will have cancer at some point in their lifetime. Complete removal of the cancer without damage to the rest of the body (that is, achieving cure with near-zero adverse effects) is the ideal, if rarely achieved, goal of treatment and is often the goal in practice. Sometimes this can be accomplished by surgery, but the propensity of cancers to invade adjacent tissue or to spread to distant sites by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness; and chemotherapy and radiotherapy can have a negative effect on normal cells. Therefore, cure with nonnegligible adverse effects may be accepted as a practical goal in some cases; and besides curative intent, practical goals of therapy can also include (1) suppressing the cancer to a subclinical state and maintaining that state for years of good quality of life (that is, treating the cancer as a chronic disease), and (2) palliative care without curative intent (for advanced-stage metastatic cancers). Because \\"cancer\\" refers to a class of diseases, it is unlikely that there will ever be a single \\"cure for cancer\\" any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases. Angiogenesis inhibitors were once thought to have potential as a \\"silver bullet\\" treatment applicable to many types of cancer, but this has not been the case in practice. Types of treatments The treatment of cancer has undergone evolutionary changes as understanding of the underlying biological processes has increased. Tumor removal surgeries have been documented in ancient Egypt, hormone therapy and radiation therapy were developed in the late 19th century. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and newer targeted therapies are products of the 20th century. As new information about the biology of cancer emerges, treatments will be developed and modified to increase effectiveness, precision, survivability, and quality of life. =Surgery= In theory, non-hematological cancers can be cured if entirely removed by surgery, but this is not always possible. When the cancer has metastasized to other sites in the body prior to surgery, complete surgical excision is usually impossible. In the Halstedian model of cancer progression, tumors grow locally, then spread to the lymph nodes, then to the rest of the body. This has given rise to the popularity of local-only treatments such as surgery for small cancers. Even small localized tumors are increasingly recognized as possessing metastatic potential. Examples of surgical procedures for cancer include mastectomy for breast cancer, prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and lung cancer surgery for non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of the surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, or the entire organ. A single cancer cell is invisible to the naked eye but can regrow into a new tumor, a process called recurrence. For this reason, the pathologist will examine the surgical specimen to determine if a margin of healthy tissue is present, thus decreasing the chance that microscopic cancer cells are left in the patient. In addition to removal of the primary tumor, surgery is often necessary for staging, e.g. determining the extent of the disease and whether it has metastasized to regional lymph nodes. Staging is a major determinant of prognosis and of the need for adjuvant therapy. Occasionally, surgery is necessary to control symptoms, such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction. This is referred to as palliative treatment. Surgery may be performed before or after other forms of treatment. Treatment before surgery is often described as neoadjuvant. In breast cancer, the survival rate of patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are no different to those who are treated following surgery. Giving chemotherapy earlier allows oncologists to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy, and may make removal of the tumor easier. However, the survival advantages of neoadjuvant treatment in lung cancer are less clear. =Radiation therapy= Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy, X-ray therapy, or irradiation) is the use of ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can be administered externally via external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or internally via brachytherapy. The effects of radiation therapy are localised and confined to the region being treated. Radiation therapy injures or destroys cells in the area being treated (the \\"target tissue\\") by damaging their genetic material, making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow and divide. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, most normal cells can recover from the effects of radiation and function properly. The goal of radiation therapy is to damage as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting harm to nearby healthy tissue. Hence, it is given in many fractions, allowing healthy tissue to recover between fractions. Radiation therapy may be used to treat almost every type of solid tumor, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, uterus, or soft tissue sarcomas. Radiation is also used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. Radiation dose to each site depends on a number of factors, including the radio sensitivity of each cancer type and whether there are tissues and organs nearby that may be damaged by radiation. Thus, as with every form of treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects. Radiation therapy kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA (the molecules inside cells that carry genetic information and pass it from one generation to the next) (1).Radiation therapy can either damage DNA directly or create charged particles (free radicals) within the cells that can in turn damage the DNA. (2) Radiation therapy can lead to dry mouth from exposure of salivary glands to radiation. The salivary glands lubricate the mouth with moisture or spit. Post therapy, the salivary glands will resume functioning but rarely in the same fashion. Dry mouth caused by radiation can be a lifelong problem. The specifics of your brain cancer radiation therapy plan will be based on several factors, including the type and size of the brain tumor and the extent of disease. External beam radiation is commonly used for brain cancer. The area radiated typically includes the tumor and an area surrounding the tumor. For metastatic brain tumors, radiation is sometimes given to the entire brain. Radiation therapy uses special equipment to send high doses of radiation to the cancer cells. Most cells in the body grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster than many of the normal cells around them. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cell. Radiation might not be a choice of treatment if the tumour was diagnosed on the late stage or is located on vulnerable places. Moreover, radiation causes significant side effects if used in children aged 0‚Äì14. It was determined to be a beneficial treatment but it causes significant side effects that influence the lifestyle of the young patients. Radiotherapy is the use of high-energy rays, usually x-rays and similar rays (such as electrons) to treat disease. It works by destroying cancer cells in the area that's treated. Although normal cells can also be damaged by radiotherapy, they can usually repair themselves, but cancer cells can't. If the tumour was found on the late stage, it requires patients to have higher radiation exposure which might be harmful for the organs. Radiotherapy is determined to be an effective treatment in adults but it causes significant side effects that can influence patients\` daily living. In children radiotherapy mostly causes long-term side effects such as hearing loss and blindness. Children who had received cranial radiotherapy are deemed at a high risk for academic failure and cognitive delay. A study by Reddy A.T. determined the significant decrease in IQ with higher doses of radiation, specifically for children with brain tumours. Radiation therapy is not the best treatment for brain tumours, especially in young children as it causes significant damages. There are alternative treatments available for young patients such as surgical resection to decrease the occurrence of side effects. =Chemotherapy= Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs (\\"anticancer drugs\\") that can destroy cancer cells. In current usage, the term \\"chemotherapy\\" usually refers to cytotoxic drugs which affect rapidly dividing cells in general, in contrast with targeted therapy (see below). Chemotherapy drugs interfere with cell division in various possible ways, e.g. with the duplication of DNA or the separation of newly formed chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not specific to cancer cells, although some degree of specificity may come from the inability of many cancer cells to repair DNA damage, while normal cells generally can. Hence, chemotherapy has the potential to harm healthy tissue, especially those tissues that have a high replacement rate (e.g. intestinal lining). These cells usually repair themselves after chemotherapy. Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at the same time. This is called \\"combination chemotherapy\\"; most chemotherapy regimens are given in a combination. The treatment of some leukaemias and lymphomas requires the use of high-dose chemotherapy, and total body irradiation (TBI). This treatment ablates the bone marrow, and hence the body's ability to recover and repopulate the blood. For this reason, bone marrow, or peripheral blood stem cell harvesting is carried out before the ablative part of the therapy, to enable \\"rescue\\" after the treatment has been given. This is known as autologous stem cell transplantation. =Targeted therapies= Targeted therapy, which first became available in the late 1990s, has had a significant impact in the treatment of some types of cancer, and is currently a very active research area. This constitutes the use of agents specific for the deregulated proteins of cancer cells. Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are generally inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins within the cancer cell. Prominent examples are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib (Gleevec/Glivec) and gefitinib (Iressa). Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the therapeutic agent is an antibody which specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. Examples include the anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) used in breast cancer, and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, used in a variety of B-cell malignancies. Targeted therapy can also involve small peptides as \\"homing devices\\" which can bind to cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor. Radionuclides which are attached to these peptides (e.g. RGDs) eventually kill the cancer cell if the nuclide decays in the vicinity of the cell. Especially oligo- or multimers of these binding motifs are of great interest, since this can lead to enhanced tumor specificity and avidity. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a ternary treatment for cancer involving a photosensitizer, tissue oxygen, and light (often using lasersDuarte, F J (Ed.), Tunable Laser Applications (CRC, New York, 2009) Chapters 5, 7, 8.). PDT can be used as treatment for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or lung cancer; PDT can also be useful in removing traces of malignant tissue after surgical removal of large tumors. In February 2019, medical scientists announced that iridium attached to albumin, creating a photosensitized molecule, can penetrate cancer cells and, after being irradiated with light, destroy the cancer cells. High-energy therapeutic ultrasound could increase higher-density anti-cancer drug load and nanomedicines to target tumor sites by 20x fold higher than traditional target cancer therapy. Targeted therapies under pre-clinical development as potential cancer treatments include morpholino splice switching oligonucleotides, which induce ERG exon skipping in prostate cancer models, multitargeted kinase inhibitors that inhibit the PI3K with other pathways including MEK and PIM, and inhibitors of NFKB in models of chemotherapy resistance. =Immunotherapy= A renal cell carcinoma (lower left) in a kidney specimen. Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic strategies designed to induce the patient's own immune system to fight the tumor. Contemporary methods for generating an immune response against tumours include intravesical BCG immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, and use of interferons and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma patients. Cancer vaccines to generate specific immune responses are the subject of intensive research for a number of tumours, notably malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Sipuleucel-T is a vaccine-like strategy in late clinical trials for prostate cancer in which dendritic cells from the patient are loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase peptides to induce a specific immune response against prostate-derived cells. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (\\"bone marrow transplantation\\" from a genetically non-identical donor) can be considered a form of immunotherapy, since the donor's immune cells will often attack the tumor in a phenomenon known as graft-versus-tumor effect. For this reason, allogeneic HSCT leads to a higher cure rate than autologous transplantation for several cancer types, although the side effects are also more severe. The cell based immunotherapy in which the patients own Natural Killer cells(NK) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes(CTL) are used has been in practice in Japan since 1990. NK cells and CTLs primarily kill the cancer cells when they are developed. This treatment is given together with the other modes of treatment such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy and called as Autologous Immune Enhancement Therapy (AIET). Immune Checkpoint therapy focuses on two \\"checkpoint\\" proteins, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte‚Äìassociated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1). Under normal conditions, the immune system utilizes checkpoint proteins as negative feedback mechanisms to return to homeostasis once pathogens have been cleared from the body. In tumor microenvironment, cancer cells can commandeer this physiological regulatory system to \\"put a brake\\" on the anti-cancer immune response and evade immune surveillance. 2018 Nobel Prize in medicine is awarded to Dr. James Allison of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in U.S. and Dr. Tasuku Honjo Kyoto University in Japan for their contributions in advance of PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint therapy. =Hormonal therapy= The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking certain hormones. Common examples of hormone-sensitive tumors include certain types of breast and prostate cancers. Blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment. In certain cancers, administration of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be therapeutically beneficial. =Angiogenesis inhibitors= Angiogenesis inhibitors prevent the extensive growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis) that tumors require to survive. Some, such as bevacizumab, have been approved and are in clinical use. One of the main problems with anti-angiogenesis drugs is that many factors stimulate blood vessel growth in cells normal or cancerous. Anti-angiogenesis drugs only target one factor, so the other factors continue to stimulate blood vessel growth. Other problems include route of administration, maintenance of stability and activity and targeting at the tumor vasculature. =Synthetic lethality= Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of deficiencies in the expression of two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a deficiency in only one of these genes does not. The deficiencies can arise through mutations, epigenetic alterations or inhibitors of one or both of the genes. Cancer cells are frequently deficient in a DNA repair gene. (Also see DNA repair deficiency in cancer.) This DNA repair defect either may be due to mutation or, often, epigenetic silencing (see epigenetic silencing of DNA repair). If this DNA repair defect is in one of seven DNA repair pathways (see DNA repair pathways), and a compensating DNA repair pathway is inhibited, then the tumor cells may be killed by synthetic lethality. Non-tumorous cells, with the initial pathway intact, can survive. Ovarian cancer Mutations in DNA repair genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 (active in homologous recombinational repair) are synthetically lethal with inhibition of DNA repair gene PARP1 (active in the base excision repair and in the microhomology-mediated end joining pathways of DNA repair). Ovarian cancers have a mutational defect in BRCA1 in about 18% of patients (13% germline mutations and 5% somatic mutations) (see BRCA1). Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved in 2014 by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy. The FDA, in 2016, also approved the PARP inhibitor rucaparib to treat women with advanced ovarian cancer who have already been treated with at least two chemotherapies and have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. Colon cancer In colon cancer, epigenetic defects in the WRN gene appear to be synthetically lethal with inactivation of TOP1. In particular, irinotecan inactivation of TOP1 was synthetically lethal with deficient expression of the DNA repair WRN gene in patients with colon cancer. In a 2006 study, 45 patients had colonic tumors with hypermethylated WRN gene promoters (silenced WRN expression), and 43 patients had tumors with unmethylated WRN gene promoters, so that WRN protein expression was high. Irinotecan was more strongly beneficial for patients with hypermethylated WRN promoters (39.4 months survival) than for those with unmethylated WRN promoters (20.7 months survival). The WRN gene promoter is hypermethylated in about 38% of colorectal cancers. There are five different stages of colon cancer, and these five stages all have treatment: *Stage 0, is where the patient is required to undergo surgery to remove the polyp (American Cancer Society). *Stage 1, depending on the location of the cancer in the colon and lymph nodes, the patient undergoes surgery just like Stage 0. *Stage 2 patients undergoes removing nearby lymph nodes, but depending on what the doctor says, the patent might have to undergo chemotherapy after surgery (if the cancer is at higher risk of coming back). *Stage 3, is where the cancer has spread all throughout the lymph nodes but not yet to other organs or body parts. When getting to this stage, Surgery is conducted on the colon and lymph nodes, then the doctor orders Chemotherapy (FOLFOX or CapeOx) to treat the colon cancer in the location needed (American Cancer Society). The last a patient can get is Stage 4. *Stage 4 patients only undergo surgery if it is for the prevention of the cancer, along with pain relief. If the pain continues with these two options, the doctor might recommended radiation therapy. The main treatment strategy is chemotherapy due to how aggressive the cancer becomes in this stage, not only to the colon but to the lymph nodes. Cancer pain management Symptom control and palliative care Although the control of the symptoms of cancer is not typically thought of as a treatment directed at the cancer, it is an important determinant of the quality of life of cancer patients, and plays an important role in the decision whether the patient is able to undergo other treatments. Although doctors generally have the therapeutic skills to reduce pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage and other common problems in cancer patients, the multidisciplinary specialty of palliative care has arisen specifically in response to the symptom control needs of this group of patients. Pain medication, such as morphine and oxycodone, and antiemetics, drugs to suppress nausea and vomiting, are very commonly used in patients with cancer-related symptoms. Improved antiemetics such as ondansetron and analogues, as well as aprepitant have made aggressive treatments much more feasible in cancer patients. Cancer pain can be associated with continuing tissue damage due to the disease process or the treatment (i.e. surgery, radiation, chemotherapy). Although there is always a role for environmental factors and affective disturbances in the genesis of pain behaviors, these are not usually the predominant etiologic factors in patients with cancer pain. Some patients with severe pain associated with cancer are nearing the end of their lives, but in all cases palliative therapies should be used to control the pain. Issues such as social stigma of using opioids, work and functional status, and health care consumption can be concerns and may need to be addressed in order for the person to feel comfortable taking the medications required to control his or her symptoms. The typical strategy for cancer pain management is to get the patient as comfortable as possible using the least amount of medications possible but opioids, surgery, and physical measures are often required. Historically, doctors were reluctant to prescribe narcotics to terminal cancer patients due to addiction and respiratory function suppression. The palliative care movement, a more recent offshoot of the hospice movement, has engendered more widespread support for preemptive pain treatment for cancer patients. The World Health Organization also noted uncontrolled cancer pain as a worldwide problem and established a \\"ladder\\" as a guideline for how practitioners should treat pain in patients who have cancer Cancer-related fatigue is a very common problem for cancer patients, and has only recently become important enough for oncologists to suggest treatment, even though it plays a significant role in many patients' quality of life. =Hospice in cancer= Hospice is a group that provides care at the home of a person that has an advanced illness with a likely prognosis of less than 6 months. As most treatments for cancer involve significant unpleasant side effects, a patient with little realistic hope of a cure or prolonged life may choose to seek comfort care only, forgoing more radical therapies in exchange for a prolonged period of normal living. This is an especially important aspect of care for those patients whose disease is not a good candidate for other forms of treatment. In these patients, the risks related to the chemotherapy may actually be higher than the chance of responding to the treatment, making further attempts to cure the disease impossible. Of note, patients on hospice can sometimes still get treatments such as radiation therapy if it is being used to treat symptoms, not as an attempt to cure the cancer. Research Clinical trials, also called research studies, test new treatments in people with cancer. The goal of this research is to find better ways to treat cancer and help cancer patients. Clinical trials test many types of treatment such as new drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy, new combinations of treatments, or new methods such as gene therapy. A clinical trial is one of the final stages of a long and careful cancer research process. The search for new treatments begins in the laboratory, where scientists first develop and test new ideas. If an approach seems promising, the next step may be testing a treatment in animals to see how it affects cancer in a living being and whether it has harmful effects. Of course, treatments that work well in the lab or in animals do not always work well in people. Studies are done with cancer patients to find out whether promising treatments are safe and effective. Patients who take part may be helped personally by the treatment they receive. They get up-to-date care from cancer experts, and they receive either a new treatment being tested or the best available standard treatment for their cancer. At the same time, new treatments also may have unknown risks, but if a new treatment proves effective or more effective than standard treatment, study patients who receive it may be among the first to benefit. There is no guarantee that a new treatment being tested or a standard treatment will produce good results. In children with cancer, a survey of trials found that those enrolled in trials were on average not more likely to do better or worse than those on standard treatment; this confirms that success or failure of an experimental treatment cannot be predicted. =Exosome research= Exosomes are lipid-covered microvesicles shed by solid tumors into bodily fluids, such as blood and urine. Current research is being done attempting to use exosomes as a detection and monitoring method for a variety of cancers. as PDF The hope is to be able to detect cancer with a high sensitivity and specificity via detection of specific exosomes in the blood or urine. The same process can also be used to more accurately monitor a patient's treatment progress. Enzyme linked lectin specific assay or ELLSA has been proven to directly detect melanoma derived exosomes from fluid samples. Previously, exosomes had been measured by total protein content in purified samples and by indirect immunomodulatory effects. ELLSA directly measures exosome particles in complex solutions, and has already been found capable of detecting exosomes from other sources, including ovarian cancer and tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Exosomes, secreted by tumors, are also believed to be responsible for triggering programmed cell death (apoptosis) of immune cells; interrupting T-cell signaling required to mount an immune response; inhibiting the production of anti-cancer cytokines, and has implications in the spread of metastasis and allowing for angiogenesis.DOI: 10.1038/s41392-020-0205-z Studies are currently being done with \\"Lectin affinity plasmapheresis\\" (LAP), LAP is a blood filtration method which selectively targets the tumor based exosomes and removes them from the bloodstream. It is believed that decreasing the tumor-secreted exosomes in a patient's bloodstream will slow down progression of the cancer while at the same time increasing the patients own immune response. Complementary and alternative Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments are the diverse group of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not part of conventional medicine and have not been shown to be effective. \\"Complementary medicine\\" refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while \\"alternative medicine\\" refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine.What Is CAM? National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. retrieved 3 February 2008. CAM use is common among people with cancer; a 2000 study found that 69% of cancer patients had used at least one CAM therapy as part of their cancer treatment. Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been rigorously studied or tested. Some alternative treatments which have been investigated and shown to be ineffective continue to be marketed and promoted. Special circumstances =In pregnancy= The incidence of concurrent cancer during pregnancy has risen due to the increasing age of pregnant mothers and due to the incidental discovery of maternal tumors during prenatal ultrasound examinations. Cancer treatment needs to be selected to do least harm to both the woman and her embryo/fetus. In some cases a therapeutic abortion may be recommended. Radiation therapy is out of the question, and chemotherapy always poses the risk of miscarriage and congenital malformations. Little is known about the effects of medications on the child. Even if a drug has been tested as not crossing the placenta to reach the child, some cancer forms can harm the placenta and make the drug pass over it anyway. Some forms of skin cancer may even metastasize to the child's body. Diagnosis is also made more difficult, since computed tomography is infeasible because of its high radiation dose. Still, magnetic resonance imaging works normally. However, contrast media cannot be used, since they cross the placenta. As a consequence of the difficulties to properly diagnose and treat cancer during pregnancy, the alternative methods are either to perform a Cesarean section when the child is viable in order to begin a more aggressive cancer treatment, or, if the cancer is malignant enough that the mother is unlikely to be able to wait that long, to perform an abortion in order to treat the cancer. =In utero= Fetal tumors are sometimes diagnosed while still in utero. Teratoma is the most common type of fetal tumor, and usually is benign. In some cases these are surgically treated while the fetus is still in the uterus.  Racial and social disparities  Cancer is a significant issue that is affecting the world. Specifically in the U.S, it is expected for there to be 1,735,350 new cases of cancer, and 609,640 deaths by the end of 2018. Adequate treatment can prevent many cancer deaths but there are racial and social disparities in treatments which has a significant factor in high death rates. Minorities are more likely to suffer from inadequate treatment while white patients are more likely to receive efficient treatments in a timely manner. Having satisfactory treatment in timely manner can increase the patients likelihood of survival. It has been shown that chances of survival are significantly greater for white patients than for African American patients. The annual average mortality of patients with colorectal cancer between 1992 and 2000 was 27 and 18.5 per 100,000 white patients and 35.4 and 25.3 per 100,000 black patients. In a journal that analyzed multiple studies testing racial disparities when treating colorectal cancer found contradicting findings. The Veterans administration and an adjuvant trial found that there were no evidence to support racial differences in treating colorectal cancer. However, two studies suggested that African American patients received less satisfactory and poor quality treatment compared to white patients. One of these studies specifically was provided by the Center for Intramural Research. They found that black patients were 41% less likely to receive colorectal treatment and were more likely to be hospitalized in a teaching hospital with less certified physicians compared to white patients. Furthermore, black patients were more likely to be diagnosed with oncologic sequelae, which is a severity of the illness in result of poorly treated cancer. Lastly, for every 1,000 patients in the hospital, there were 137.4 black patient deaths and 95.6 white patient deaths. In a breast cancer journal article analyzed the disparities of breast cancer treatments in the Appalachian Mountains. African American women were found to be 3 times more likely to die compared to Asians and two times more likely to die compared to white women. According to this study, African American women are at a survival disadvantage compared to other races. Black women are also more likely to receive less successful treatment than white women by not receiving surgery or therapy. Furthermore, The National Cancer Institute panel, identified breast cancer treatments, given to black women, as inappropriate and not adequate compared to the treatment given to white women. From these studies, researchers have noted that there are definite disparities in the treatment of cancer, specifically who have access to the best treatment and can receive it in a timely manner. This eventually leads to disparities between who is dying from cancer and who is more likely to survive. The cause of these disparities is generally that African Americans have less medical care coverage, insurance and access cancer centers than other races. For an example, black patients with breast cancer and colorectal cancer were shown to be more likely to have medicaid or no insurance compared to other races. The location of the health care facility also plays a role in why African Americans receive less treatment in comparison to other races. However, some studies say that African Americans don't trust doctors and don't always seek the help they need and this explains why there are less African Americans receiving treatment. Others suggest that African Americans seek even more treatment than whites and that it is simply a lack of the resources available to them. In this case, analyzing these studies will identify the treatment disparities and look to prevent them by discovering potential causes of these disparities.

Education  Zieli≈Ñski received his BFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2002. In 2004 he earned his MFA from Yale University in New Haven, CT. Works Zieli≈Ñski's main body of work reflects on electronic devices that saturate our lives: cell phones, ATMs, computers, and paper shredders. Zieli≈Ñski's paintings are mixed media, which includes a variety of materials. The paintings are textured and have sculptural depth.. Often, he begins by painting wide strokes of interference paint which include titanium-coated mica flakes and change color depending upon the angle they are viewed from. Then, he outlines shapes painted thinly in acrylic with chalk or crayon and more paint. The result adds a third dimension to the traditional two-dimensional canvas. Zieli≈Ñski entered Yale with a background in information theory and his artwork then consisted of conceptual collage grids made from cloth. Over the next few years at Yale his work transformed from orderly black and white collages into intense bright paintings of everyday objects, including laptops. These works were humorous in their presentation. The lines were crooked, perspectives were tilted, and the colors were absurdly bright and reminiscent of Fauvist canvases. Zieli≈Ñski‚Äôs next interest became ATM, paper shredders, and cell phones. Again, the artist painted in thick wild colors. Zieli≈Ñski focused on how these machines hide their complexities behind their simple exteriors. ATM hold our most important financial information, yet most of us hardly know how they function. Zieli≈Ñski makes painting relatable to the 21st century viewer with his subject matter. The cell phone has become a vital part of life in the current era.

It was created by Austin Appleby in 2008 and is currently hosted on GitHub along with its test suite named 'SMHasher'. It also exists in a number of variants, all of which have been released into the public domain. The name comes from two basic operations, multiply (MU) and rotate (R), used in its inner loop. Unlike cryptographic hash functions, it is not specifically designed to be difficult to reverse by an adversary, making it unsuitable for cryptographic purposes. Variants =MurmurHash3= The current version is MurmurHash3, which yields a 32-bit or 128-bit hash value. When using 128-bits, the x86 and x64 versions do not produce the same values, as the algorithms are optimized for their respective platforms. MurmurHash3 was released alongside SMHasher‚Äîa hash function test suite. =MurmurHash2= MurmurHash2 yields a 32-bit or 64-bit value. It came in multiple variants, including some that allowed incremental hashing and aligned or neutral versions. * MurmurHash2 (32-bit, x86) - The original version; contains a flaw that weakens collision in some cases. * MurmurHash2A (32-bit, x86) - A fixed variant using Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction. Slightly slower. * CMurmurHash2A (32-bit, x86) - MurmurHash2A but works incrementally. * MurmurHashNeutral2 (32-bit, x86) - Slower, but endian and alignment neutral. * MurmurHashAligned2 (32-bit, x86) - Slower, but does aligned reads (safer on some platforms). * MurmurHash64A (64-bit, x64) - The original 64-bit version. Optimized for 64-bit arithmetic. * MurmurHash64B (64-bit, x86) - A 64-bit version optimized for 32-bit platforms. It is not a true 64-bit hash due to insufficient mixing of the stripes. The person who originally found the flaw in MurmurHash2 created an unofficial 160-bit version of MurmurHash2 called MurmurHash2_160. =MurmurHash1= The original MurmurHash was created as an attempt to make a faster function than Lookup3. Although successful, it hadn't been tested thoroughly and wasn't capable of providing 64-bit hashes as in Lookup3. It had a rather elegant design, that would be later built upon in MurmurHash2, combining a multiplicative hash (similar to Fowler‚ÄìNoll‚ÄìVo hash function) with a Xorshift. Implementations The canonical implementation is in C++, but there are efficient ports for a variety of popular languages, including Python, C, Go, C#, D, Lua, Perl, Ruby, Rust, PHP, Common Lisp, Haskell, Elm, Clojure, Scala, Java,Murmur3, part of Guava Erlang, Swift, and JavaScript, together with an online version.

Development Founded in 1923 by Dr.-Ing. Adolf Rohrbach, the Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau GmbH designed and built many aircraft using light-alloy stressed skin construction methods that were at the cutting edge of aircraft design in the 1920s. His previous experience with light-alloys at the Zeppelin-Staaken factory served Rohrbach well when designing the Rohrbach stressed-skin aircraft. After designing the un-built Ro I twin-engined flying boat, Rohrbach developed the Rohrbach Ro II flying boat as an all-metal shoulder winged monoplane flying boat with two tractor engines mounted in nacelles, above the wings, on struts. Planforms and profiles were kept as simple as possible with rectangular section fuselage frames (with vee planing bottoms), constant chord wings, tailplane and fin with square cut tips and distinctive protruding servo/trim/balance tabs at wing and fin tips. The two-seat open cockpit sat between the engines at the wing leading edge, with an open gunner/bosun's position at the extreme nose. A very unusual feature of several of Rohrbach's flying-boats was the provision of a pair of masts and sails to be rigged in the event of engine failure to allow the aircraft to be sailed back to safety. At the time of the Ro II's production the Versailles Treaty forbade the construction of large aircraft in Germany so Rohrbach set up a Danish company, the 'Rohrbach-Metall-Aeroplan Co. A/S', to build the early Rohrbach aircraft. The strict regulation of the aircraft industry was relaxed in 1926 allowing the Rohrbach series to be built at the Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau GmbH factory in Berlin. Operational history The first flight of the Ro II took place on 11 November 1923, pilotted by Werner Landmann and the aircraft was used in FAI record attempts for speed/load on 24 October 1924. After trials and record attempts were completed the aircraft was sold to Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha Ltd., re-designated Yokosho Experimental Type R 1 and used for trials by the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Jagels (born March 26, 1949) is a former American prosecutor and was Kern County, California‚Äôs longest-sitting District Attorney, holding the office from 1983 to 2010. During this time, he prosecuted some notorious cases of wrongful convictions, and engaged in what is now acknowledged widely to have been a pattern a prosecutorial misconduct, in which he convicted innocent people of abusing children. Kern County has since paid out 10 million dollars in settlements to the people wrongly convicted by Ed Jagels.https://www.kerncounty.com/da/pdf/DaList.pdf  Early life and education  Edward R. Jagels was born on March 26, 1949, in Los Angeles California to George and Margret Jagels. His father, George Daniel Jagels was an attorney. He attended middle school at the Mayfield Junior School in Pasadena, CA. He began high school at the Woodside Priory School in Portola Valley, CA before moving on to the Robert Louis Stevenson high school in Pebble Beach, CA where he graduated in 1967. Following high school, he attended Stanford University where he majored in history and joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps before graduating in 1971. Influenced in part by his father, an attorney, Jagels chose to pursue a career in law at the University of California, Hastings College of Law where he graduated in 1974. While at Hastings, he found an interest in the law of evidence and criminal procedure which lead him to pursue a career in criminal justice and ultimately to the Kern County District Attorney's Office where he would spend the remainder of his career.  Early career  Jagels joined the Kern County District Attorney's Office in 1975 as a deputy district attorney in the misdemeanor unit. In the earliest part of his career, he worked in the misdemeanor and juvenile courts before becoming the East Kern floater deputy, covering the outlying courts in Ridgecrest, Lake Isabella, Tehachapi, and Mojave. Roughly a year and a half after joining the office, Jagels replaced Frank Hoover as the legal adviser to the Narcotics Task Force (NTF), a joint task force between city and county law enforcement officers designed to combat narcotics trafficking in Kern County. Unlike his predecessors, Jagels took it upon himself to be more than an adviser to the task force, insisting instead that he personally try those cases investigated by the task force. After leaving the Narcotics Task Force, Jagels partnered with fellow deputy district attorney Steven Tauzer in an effort to improve the quality and consistency of criminal prosecutions within the office. Together, Jagels and Tauzer submitted a proposal to then-District Attorney Albert Leddy for the division of the office into specialized units devoted to particular types of crimes. Until that time, the Kern County District Attorney‚Äôs Office had been loosely divided into two primary groups, misdemeanor prosecutors and felony prosecutors with the latter group handling the full range of felony cases from vehicle theft to murder. Their proposal, which was accepted, created four new units, Homicides, Sex Crimes, Narcotics, and Branch Operations with each section specializing in those types of crimes. The restructuring of the office in this way laid the groundwork for the modern structure of the Kern County District Attorney‚Äôs Office. In the early 1980s Jagels was the head of what was then the District Attorneys Association (now the Kern County Prosecutors Association). The association, which operates independently from the District Attorney‚Äôs Office itself, is made up of non-managerial deputy district attorneys within the office. As president of that association Jagels organized an office wide effort to collect signatures in support of the Victim‚Äôs Bill of Rights initiative which ultimately passed in 1982 adding article I, ¬ß 28 to the California Constitution. Career Jagels was elected District Attorney of the Kern County District Attorney's Office in 1983. Soon after his election he created a task force to investigate sex crimes against children. The cases eventually brought between 1983 and 1987 involved false claims of satanic ritual abuse performed by eight supposed pedophile groups. The cases, brought without physical evidence, were based solely on the testimony of alleged child victims who had been coached and sometimes tricked into testifying against their parents and other adults. Long prison sentences were obtained against many adults, but the cases began to unravel in the late 1980s as the children recanted their testimony.Sevcik, Kimberley (May 5, 2005). \\"Dirty Secrets\\". Rolling Stone, 973. pp 63-66. Of the 26 convictions, 25 were reversed. One defendant was in prison for 19 years before his conviction was reversed.Conviction reversed after 19 years, Los Angeles Times, John Johnson, May 1, 2004. Retrieved 11 October 2014. The county paid out nearly $10 million to settle claims made by the former prisoners and the alleged victims. Actor Sean Penn, who met a man accused of child sex crimes, narrated and served as executive producer for the documentary film, Witch Hunt, concerning the event. As a \\"get tough on crime\\" prosecutor, Jagels was very popular in his conservative town of Bakersfield, California even after his earlier cases unraveled. In the 2000s he prosecuted a man under the three strikes law, which carried a mandatory 25-year prison sentence, for stealing a pack of doughnuts worth less than $1, because the man had been convicted of two felonies in the 1970s. He was unapologetic about the false convictions in the 1980s sex abuse cases, and was re-elected six times as district attorney, before announcing his retirement in 2009. He led a voter campaign to defeat three liberal justices from California's supreme court, and was influential in promoting victims' rights, the death penalty, and California's three strikes law. In 1986, a grand jury released a blistering report on the sex abuse prosecutions, accusing Kern County officials of fostering a \\"presumption of guilt\\", concealing exculpatory evidence and bringing charges based on guesswork. California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, a Democrat, released a report that year reaching the same conclusions. By his second term, Jagels had tripled the number of prosecutorial complaints lodged against the District Attorney's office. By 2009, Kern County paid out more than $9 million in wrongful conviction settlements.Kern County's monstrous D.A., Reason Magazine, December 21, 2009. Retrieved 2 February 2017.

Sarbi was later rediscovered by an American soldier, and was reunited with Australian forces pending repatriation to Australia. Her name is sometimes spelled 'Sabi'. Background Sarbi was a female black Labrador Retriever Newfoundland cross trained in explosives detection. For her role in Afghanistan, Sarbi was trained to detect improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Or≈´zgƒÅn Province. Contradictory reports at the time of her discovery put Sarbi's age at either four or ten years old. Sarbi had previously been used by the Incident Response Regiment during the 2006 Commonwealth Games held in Melbourne, Australia, before being deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Australian Army's Operation Slipper. Operation Slipper is the name of Australian military's part in to the ongoing War in Afghanistan, in which a Taliban insurgency is fighting forces of the International Security Assistance Force. When she disappeared, Sarbi was in her second tour of duty in Afghanistan, having previously been deployed in 2007. Loss and rediscovery Sarbi went missing after a joint Australian, American and Afghan vehicle convoy was ambushed by insurgents on 2 September 2008 during the Battle of Khaz Oruzgan. Sarbi reportedly disappeared 'in the heat of battle' and was said by a Defence spokesperson to have vanished when a rocket exploded near her during the ambush. The ambush in which Sarbi went missing was the same action in which SASR Trooper Mark Donaldson became the first recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia, the first VC awarded to an Australian since 1969. Sarbi was declared MIA in September 2008, and while missing, the Special Operations Task Group had made repeated attempts to find out what had become of her. Sarbi was rediscovered in November 2009 by an American soldier in north-eastern Oruzgan province, when he noticed Sarbi accompanying a local man. The soldier, only identified as 'John', was aware that the Australian forces were missing a dog, and determined through the use of voice commands that Sarbi was indeed a trained military dog. After being flown back to her Australian base in Tarin Kowt, handlers confirmed the dog was Sarbi. Reactions The news of Sarbi's return had been released by the Department of Defence on Wednesday 11 November (Remembrance Day), and generated worldwide media attention. The news was released on the same day as the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the ISAF head General Stanley A. McChrystal were making a surprise visit to the Tarin Kowt base, leading to their meeting Sarbi in person. Brigadier Brian Dawson, Head of Defence Public Affairs, held a press conference about Sarbi. Prime Minister Rudd said of Sarbi's rediscovery: > Things like that, they may seem quite small, but in fact the symbolism is > quite strong, and the symbolism of it is us out there doing a job...We > haven't awarded any Australian Victoria Cross for 40 years. Trooper > Donaldson stands out there as an Australian hero, and now his dog Sarbi back > is home in one piece and a genuinely nice pooch as well. Retired Lieutenant Colonel George Hulse, president of the Australian Defence Force Trackers and War Dogs Association, stated he and many others had \\"abandoned any hope\\" of finding Sarbi. On her return, Hulse described Sarbi as \\"an exceptionally good worker, very gritty dog and has found improvised explosive devices and she's saved quite a few lives in her work.\\" Sarbi's handler Corporal David Simpson, who was one of nine Australian soldiers injured in the ambush, was said to have never given up hope of finding her, and was profoundly relieved at her recovery, according to Hulse. The trainer who confirmed Sarbi's identity said \\"It‚Äôs amazing, just incredible, to have her back.\\" Trooper Donaldson, who was in London to meet The Queen at the time of Sarbi's rediscovery, said that it \\"closed a chapter in their shared history\\" and \\"She's the last piece of the puzzle ... Having Sarbi back gives some closure for the handler and the rest of us that served with her in 2008. It's a fantastic morale booster for the guys.\\" Brigadier Dawson said that the military would probably never know what had happened to Sarbi while she was missing, but said that her good health indicated somebody had been looking after her. A Queensland based trainer of a similar black Labrador explosive detection dog stated that it was probably due to the breed's excellent character that Sarbi had most likely been looked after by locals while missing, ensuring her survival. Misha Schubert the political correspondent for The Age jokingly questioned the official account that Sarbi's whereabouts while she was missing would never be known, suggesting she had been undercover on a secret mission, or that she had been captured by the Taliban as a prisoner of war, or had simply preferred to remain Absent Without Leave (AWOL). The Australian reported on 13 November that, according to \\"a senior Australian military officer who asked not to be named\\", that Sarbi, who had been wounded in the ambush, had in fact returned to a nearby ISAF forward operating base, but was \\"chased away by Afghan guards\\". The Sunday Age on 15 November questioned the timing of the original press release about Sarbi's rediscovery, claiming that it had been deliberately held back to coincide with Prime Minister Rudd's visit to Afghanistan so as to be able to give the story to accompanying reporters. This was based on the fact that Sarbi had been in the hands of Australian forces by at least 28 October based on ADF photos posted on their website on the day of Brigadier Dawson's news conference, and not the week of 1‚Äì7 November as released. They further pointed out that questions over the timing of the release by a reporter at the Brigadier's press conference were not corrected by him. An ADF spokesperson denied any link to the visit, stating the delay in releasing the news was due to \\"the need to confirm Sarbi's identity, physical condition and quarantine requirements for her return to Australia\\", details of which would be required by the media, that the reference to \\"last week\\" was correct at the time of the release's first draft and unfortunately not been subsequently updated before release, and that \\"Brigadier Dawson was not aware of the exact date of Sarbi's return and was therefore not in a position to be specific about it.\\" Brigadier Dawson had at the time insisted that the timing of the announcement coinciding with Rudd's visit had been \\"pure serendipity\\", and said \\"We needed to make sure that we had all our facts straight...(so) it's really just an accident\\". Repatriation Sarbi was to undergo a period of quarantine, and be assessed for exposure to diseases, before a return date to Australia could be set. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Sarbi had passed initial veterinary checks and would be retired on her return to Australia. Prime Minister Rudd stated he would be working with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to \\"ensure Sabi's eventual return to Australia.\\" The Courier-Mail reported that under AQIS rules, dogs would not normally be allowed entry to Australia directly from Afghanistan, but would rather have to spend six months in an intermediate approved country. After arriving back in Australia, Sarbi was a pet owned by her former handler and his wife. She also became a member of the Clayfield-Toombul Sub-Branch of the RSL. A dog park in the Brisbane suburb of Warner was named in Sarbi's honour in February 2015. Sarbi died as a result of a brain tumour on 27 March 2015. Her preserved remains were donated to the Australian War Memorial and placed on display in October 2016. RSPCA Purple Cross Award On 5 April 2011, Sarbi was awarded an RSPCA Purple Cross Award at the Australian War Memorial. The RSPCA Australia Purple Cross Award recognises the deeds of animals that have shown outstanding service to humans, particularly if they showed exceptional courage in risking their own safety or life to save a person from injury or death.

In contrast, the main activities of the Information Age are analysis and thinking.Pautler, Albert J., Jr. 1998 \\"Workforce Education: Issues for the New Century.\\"Pucel, David J. 1998 \\"The Changing Role of Vocational Education and the Comprehensive High School.\\" The concept holds that technologies like virtual reality, user created content and YouTube will change the way humans interact with each other and create economic and social structures. A key concept is that the rise of an immersive virtual reality‚Äîthe cyberspace or the metaverse‚Äîwill raise the value of \\"imagination work\\" done by designers, artists, etc. over rational thinking as a foundation of culture and economics. Some argue that the Imagination Age has already started, given that imagination is the most valued skill in our modern society.Sultan Abdullah Bahabri 2003 \\"The Buzz and the Sting\\"  Origins of the term  The term Imagination Age (as well as Age of Imagination) were first introduced in an essay by designer and writer Charlie Magee in 1993. His essay,\\"The Age of Imagination: Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You\\" \\"The Age of Imagination: Coming Soon to a Civilization Near You\\" proposes the idea that the best way to assess the evolution of human civilization is through the lens of communication. > The most successful groups throughout human history have had one thing in > common: when compared to their competition they had the best system of > communication. The fittest communicators‚Äîwhether tribe, citystate, kingdom, > corporation, or nation‚Äîhad (1) a larger percentage of people with (2) access > to (3) higher quality information, (4) a greater ability to transform that > information into knowledge and action, (5) and more freedom to communicate > that new knowledge to the other members of their group. Imagination Age, as a philosophical tenet heralding a new wave of cultural and economic innovation, appears to have been first introduced by artist, writer and cultural philosopher Rita J. King in November 2007 essay for the British Council entitled, \\"The Emergence of a New Global Culture in the Imagination Age\\", where she began using the phrase, \\"Toward a New Global Culture and Economy in the Imagination Age\\": > Rather than exist as an unwitting victim of circumstance, all too often > unaware of the impact of having been born in a certain place at a certain > time, to parents firmly nestled within particular values and socioeconomic > brackets, millions of people are creating new virtual identities and > meaningful relationships with others who would have remained strangers, each > isolated within their respective realities. King further refined the development of her thinking in a 2008 Paris essay entitled, \\"Our Vision for Sustainable Culture in the Imagination Age\\" in which she states, > Active participants in the Imagination Age are becoming cultural ambassadors > by introducing virtual strangers to unfamiliar customs, costumes, > traditions, rituals and beliefs, which humanizes foreign cultures, > contributes to a sense of belonging to one's own culture and fosters an > interdependent perspective on sharing the riches of all systems. Cultural > transformation is a constant process, and the challenges of modernization > can threaten identity, which leads to unrest and eventually, if left > unchecked, to violent conflict. Under such conditions it is tempting to > impose homogeneity, which undermines the highly specific systems that > encompass the myriad luminosity of the human experience. King has expanded her interpretation of the Imagination Age concept through speeches at the O'Reilly Media, TED, Cusp, and Business Innovation Factory conferences. King also edits \\"The Imagination Age\\" blog. The term Imagination Age was subsequently popularized in techno-cultural discourse by other writers, futurists and technologists, who attributed the term to King, including Jason Silva and Tish Shute a technology entrepreneur and publisher of Augmented Reality and emerging technology blog \\"UgoTrade\\". Earlier, one- time, references to the Imagination Age can be found attributed to Carl W. Olson in his 2001 book \\"The Boss is Dead...: Leadership Breakthroughs for the Imagination Age,Carl W. Olson \\"The Boss is Dead...: Leadership Breakthroughs for the Imagination Age\\" virtual worlds developer Howard Stearns in 2005, and Cathilea Robinett in 2007. Previous ages The ideas of the Imagination Age depend in large part upon an idea of progress through history because of technology, notably outlined by Marx. That cultural progress has been categorized into a number of major stages of development. According to this idea civilization has progressed through the following ages, or epochs: *Agricultural Age ‚Äì economy dominated by physical work with wooden tools and animals in order to produce food *Industrial Age ‚Äì economy dominated by factories to produce commodities *Information Age ‚Äì economy dominated by knowledge workers using computers and other electronic devices for the purposes of research, finance, consulting, information technology, and other services Following this is a new paradigm created by virtual technology, high speed internet, massive data storage, and other technologies. This new paradigm, the argument goes, will create a new kind of global culture and economy called the Imagination Age. Economic rise of imagination The Imagination Age would be a society and culture dominated by an imagination economy. The idea relies on a key Marxist concept that culture is a superstructure fully conditioned by the economic substructure. According to Marxist thinking certain kinds of culture and art were made possible by the adoption of farming technology. Then with the rise of industry new forms of political organization (democracy, militarism, fascism, communism) were made possible along with new forms of culture (mass media, news papers, films). These resulted in people changing. In the case of industrialization people were trained to become more literate, to follow time routines, to live in urban communities. The concept of the Imagination Age extends this to a new order emerging presently. An imagination economy is defined by some thinkers as an economy where intuitive and creative thinking create economic value, after logical and rational thinking has been outsourced to other economies.Colvin, Geoffrey \\"The imagination economy\\", FORTUNE Magazine, July 5, 2006, Reproduced in CNN Money online Michael Cox Chief Economist at Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas argues that economic trends show a shift away from information sector employment and job growth towards creative jobs. Jobs in publishing, he has pointed out are declining while jobs for designers, architects, actors & directors, software engineers and photographers are all growing. This shift in job creation is a sign the beginning of the Imagination Age.needs reference The 21st century has seen a growth in games and interactive media jobs.Joshua Brockman, NPR 2010 \\"When Play Means Pay: Video Game Jobs On The Rise\\" Cox argues that the skills can be viewed as a \\"hierarchy of human talents\\",Phil Searle \\"Q&A;: Michael Cox, Chief Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\\" with raw physical effort as the lowest form of value creation, above this skilled labor and information entry to creative reasoning and emotional intelligence. Each layer provides more value creation than the skills below it, and the outcome of globalization and automation is that labor is made available for higher level skills that create more value. Presently these skills tend to be around imagination, social and emotional intelligence. Technology Key to the idea that imagination is becoming the key commodity of our time is a confidence that virtual reality technology like Oculus Rift and HoloLens will emerge to take much of the place of the current text-and-graphic dominated internet. This will provide a 3D internet where imagination and creativity (over information and search) will be key to creating user experience and value. The concept is not limited to just virtual reality. Charlie Magee states that the technology that will develop during the Imagination Age would include: > The best bet is on a hybrid breakthrough created by the meshing of > nanotechnology, computer science (including artificial intelligence), > biotechnology (including biochemistry, biopsychology, etc.), and virtual > reality. In The Singularity is Near, Raymond Kurzweil states that future combination of AI, nano-technology, and biotechnology will create a world where anything that can be imagined will be possible, raising the importance of imagination as the key mode of human thinking.Kurzweil, Ray \\"The Singularity is Near\\" Viking Penguin 2005 p299-300 Global implications Rita J. King has been the single major advocate of the Imagination Age concept and its implications on cultural relations, identity and the transformation of the global economy and culture. King has expounded on the concept through speeches at the O'Reilly Media and TED conferences and has argued that virtual world technology and changes in people's ability to imagine other lives could promote world understanding and reduce cultural conflict. Some public policy experts have argued the emergence of the Imagination Age out of the Information Age will have a major impact on overall public policy.Tod Newcombe \\"A Champion for the Imagination Age\\" Public CIO See also * Attention economy * Cognitive- cultural economy * Cognitive Surplus, 2010 book * Information society * Indigo Era * Netocracy, concept whereby power revolves around the ability to form and use networks and technological tools * Post-scarcity economy References 20th century 21st century Historical eras Information Age Modern history Science fiction themes University of Southern California faculty Virtual reality Virtual reality communities Age ","title":"Imagination age"},{"id":"25081411","text":"Ernest Hackett (born 1908, date of death unknown) was a footballer who played in the Football League for Coventry City and Newport County.

KEEPS was a fully integrated turnkey system, consisting of publishing software from Interleaf, computer hardware from Sun Microsystems, customized front-end software developed by Kodak that ran on Unix System V Release 4, and Kodak's high-end Ektaprint printers, scanners, and copiers. KEEPS was capable of producing WYSIWYG (\\"what you see is what you get\\") output at near-typeset quality, while also offering document management and workflow tools for collaborative environments. Marketing materials from Kodak distinguished KEEPs from Desktop Publishing by describing the product as Professional Electronic Publishing. KEEPS became the preferred document publishing system from 1989-1990 amongst governments and large corporations.  History  During its inception in the early 1980s, Eastman Kodak Company put together a specialized division to sell and maintain KEEPS. Kodak bought the rights to the Atek Publishing System in the early 1980s. At the time of acquisition, Atek was the leading publishing software product for newspapers and magazines. Kodak established contracts with Sun Microsystems which allowed it to sell workstation and server equipment for less money than Sun itself could sell it for. The arrangement was made possible by Kodak agreeing to provide installation, service and support of the hardware themselves. In the early stages of KEEPS's product life cycle, Kodak had a significant advantage in making sales to the federal government which (at that time) preferred doing business with older established companies‚Äîespecially since Kodak already had a substantial presence in government with its copiers, film, and other technology, and could leverage government contacts and contracts into new business. At first, Kodak hired representatives (both sales/marketing and technicians) who had extensive knowledge of the publishing industry, and promised them competitive salaries. At the peak of KEEPS's popularity in 1990, the Quark Publishing System was not released yet, Xerox Ventura Publisher (now Corel Ventura) was still in its early stages, as was Aldus Pagemaker (now Adobe Pagemaker). Arbortext and Framemaker were still on the horizon. Later, Kodak reneged on the salary promises they made, and slowly began losing division staff to competitors offering better salaries, including Interleaf, Frame Technology Corp, Arbortext, etc. Kodak renamed its KEEPS publishing and copier line to Lionheart. By then, the division lost most of the people who really understood the product and the publishing industry. Lionheart was discontinued after Interleaf announced a new version of their product (Interleaf 5) which would run on PCs. In 1991, Quark released a viable product suitable for collaborative environments, and Ventura Publisher and Pagemaker became serious competitors.

She assisted Wyatt Walker in planning the early portions of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's involvement in the 1963 Birmingham campaign during the Civil Rights Movement.White, Marjorie Longenecker (1998) A Walk to Freedom: The Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, 1956-1964. Birmingham: Birmingham Historical Society. Early life On December 19th, 1932 Lola Mae Haynes, the first of two daughters, was born to Buford and Addie Hanes. Lola Mae Haynes was born in Birmingham, Alabama on 4th Avenue and 15th Street South on the south side of Birmingham. Her father was employed as a coal-truck driver from LaGrange, Georgia and her mother, from Chambers County, Alabama, worked as a domestic cook. Lola Mae Haynes went to school in Birmingham at Cameron Elementary School, graduated, and then went to Ullman High School for two years. In 1949, Haynes attended Parker High School for two years and graduated in January of '51. After graduating from Parker High School, she began working as an elevator operator at Hillman Hospital, now called University Hospital. Lola Mae Haynes saved her money from the hospital for a year, until she was able to enroll herself in beauty school in 1952 where she attended the Ruth Porter's School of Beauty Culture. In February 1953, Lola Mae Haynes married Joseph Hendricks. Lola then went on to study for two years at the Booker T. Washington Business College. After graduating from Booker T. Washington Business College, Lola began employment in the insurance industry at Alexander & Company. The company, owned by John J. Drew and his wife Deanie, had employed Lola Mae Haynes Hendricks as a clerk-typist and an insurance writer.Huntley, Horace (January 19, 1995) Interview with Lola Hendricks. Birmingham Civil Rights Institute In 1963, Haynes began working for the Federal Government under the Social Security Administration, where she became one of the first African Americans to integrate amongst the whites into the workforce. Hendricks worked in files for about two years, and then was promoted to Clerk Typing and again, to Award Typing. Civil Rights Movement The Hendrickses were members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). When the group was outlawed by the State of Alabama in 1956 she became one of the early members of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, joining at a mass meeting at Nelson Smith's New Pilgrim Baptist Church where she was a member. The ACMHR, led by Shuttlesworth, organized local boycotts and demonstrations as well as coordinating legal challenges to Birmingham's segregation laws in the 1950s and 1960s. Hendricks and her husband were the named parties in ACMHR-backed lawsuits to force integration of Birmingham city parks and to desegregate the Birmingham Public Library. She also served as the organization's correspondence secretary, working from Shuttleworth's office at Bethel Baptist Church from 1956 until the culmination of the Birmingham Campaign. In December 1962 she traveled to New England as a field director for the Southern Conference Education Fund, raising awareness among Northerners about the realities of Southern segregation and soliciting donations of Christmas toys for movement members boycotting Birmingham's department stores. In the Spring of 1963, Hendricks coordinated the practical office requirements and cultivated local contacts for the combined efforts of the ACMHR and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which Shuttlesworth had co-founded and which was chaired by Martin Luther King, Jr.. She worked directly with the SCLC's Wyatt Walker during the campaign, helping organize support and logistics for marches and department store boycotts. It was Hendricks who applied directly to Public Safety Commissioner Eugene \\"Bull\\" Connor for a parade permit for the first day of marches and was told \\"You will not get a permit in Birmingham, Alabama to picket. I'll picket you over to the jail.\\"McWhorter, Diane (2001) Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution. New York, New York: Simon & Schuster. At Walker's urging she did not actively demonstrate and risk jailing, protecting her behind-the-scenes importance to the movement. Hendricks' nine-year-old daughter, Audrey Faye Hendricks (1952‚Äì2009), however, was the only child in her class to participate in the May 2, 1963 \\"Children's Crusade\\" that brought national attention to Connor's brutal tactics against demonstrators. She spent five nights in jail as minders got word out to her parents that she was safe.Sznajderman, Michael (Fall 2003) \\"A dangerous business: Children on the front line.\\" Alabama Heritage She was the youngest known child to be arrested for that protest. The children's book The Youngest Marcher: The Story of Audrey Faye Hendricks, A Young Civil Rights Activist (2017) by Cynthia Levinson, is about that. That book also contains a recipe for Lola Hendricks‚Äôs \\"Hot Rolls Baptized in Butter\\". Later life Hendricks left her insurance company job in 1963 to join the newly integrated Birmingham office of the Social Security Administration. She was hired originally as a filer, but was promoted to unit clerk before moving to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission where she became a supervisor. She left in 1983 to care for her mother. In 1988 she rejoined the Social Security Administration where she worked until reaching retirement. She continued to volunteer at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and in the mid 1990s she assisted the Birmingham Historical Society in researching movement churches and landmarks for National Register of Historic Places status.

From the early 1960s, these expeditions had a focus on improving the health and social welfare of the people of Nepal, including the improvement of water supplies, the building of schools, bridges and an airstrip at Lukla, and the provision of medical care and a programme of vaccination against smallpox. In 1966, Hillary, with overseas volunteers and local people, built the hospital at Kunde. The hospital opened on December 18, 1966, when Dr John McKinnon and Diane McKinnon, of New Zealand, became the first volunteer couple to staff the hospital. The hospital was initially staffed by overseas volunteers from New Zealand and Canada, provided through the Volunteer Service Abroad organisation and later by The Himalayan Trust and the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation Canada.

Kimlik No.) is a unique personal identification number that is assigned to every citizen of Turkey. Foreigners residing in Turkey at least six months for any purpose receive a Foreigner Identification Number, which is different from the Turkish Identification Number.  Purpose  The purpose of identification number's introduction is to resolve the problems that arise by same names of different citizens and to speed up the information transfer between the public institutions. With the identification number, services like taxation, security, voting, education, social security, health care, military recruitment, banking and many others can be carried out more quickly, rationally and reliably. History The Turkish Identification Number was introduced on October 28, 2000 in conjunction with the Act No. 3080, which amended the initial Population Registration Act No. 1587, and applied to all citizens born after 1840, dead or alive around 120 million people at that time. It was issued by the 923 registration offices at district level across the country. From January 1, 2003 on, all public institutions integrated the personal identification number in their certificates and documents like identity card, passport, international family book, driving license, form and manifesto they issue to citizens. The Identity Card Serial Number formerly in use was not needed any more and so cancelled. MERNIS Project Turkish Identification Number was developed and put in service in context of a project called Central Registration Administration System (, abbreviated as MERNƒ∞S), The idea for the project was born in 1972 after the Population Registration Law was enacted. Following infrastructural works done by the State Planning Organization and later by the Middle East Technical University, the World Bank financially supported the project in 1996 with credit. The cost of the project amounted to US$35 million. Personal data of 70 million Turkish citizens, 5 million Turks living abroad and 24 million dead were recorded in a databank with the help of the personal identification number using a special software that was developed for US$400,000. Moreover, 23 million records of married, divorced and naturalized people were added giving identification number. After accomplishment of the initial issue of the personal identification number, it is being given only to newborns and naturalized people. The MERNƒ∞S database is in online service since the end of November 2002, however not fully open to the public for secrecy of private data. However leaked copies of the database have surfaced following a security breach by staff who sold copies on DVD in 2010, and which became widely available on the internet via peer-to-peer file sharing services in early 2016. Identification number The identification number is a unique 11-digit number given by the MERNIS computer on the basis of the citizen's registration record that is kept by the registration office. The number does not reflect any personal information about the citizen. It is not possible to change the identification number once applied. Query of the identification number The identification number can be obtained by the registration offices or online at internet via the Ministry of Interior's portal.

It determines which team from the Central League (CL) and which team from the Pacific League (PL) will compete in the Japan Series for the national championship. Since the creation of the NPB's two-league system in 1950, the leagues have used several different methods to determine entry to the Japan Series. The current system has been used since the 2007 season. Both leagues play a 143-game regular season, after which the top three teams in each league compete against one another in a two- stage playoff. In the First Stage, the teams that finish the regular season with the second- and third-best records play one another in a best-of-three series. The winners of these three-game series advance to the Final Stage to face each league's regular-season champion in a six-game series, which the regular-season champion starts with a one-game advantage. The winners of each league's Final Stage series compete against one another in that year's Japan Series. History Since the creation of the NPB's two-league system, the regular-season winner of the CL had always advanced to the Japan Series, where it competed against the PL champion. The PL used the same system until 1973, when the league created NPB's only postseason play prior to 2004 (other than the Japan Series). This system matched the team with the best first-half record against the team with the best second-half record. The winner of this best-of-five series advanced to the Japan Series, where they played against the CL champion. This system proved problematic when the Hankyu Braves won both the first and second halves of the 1976 and 1978 seasons, making a playoff series unnecessary. The system was eliminated after the 1982 season. Instead, the PL announced the following season that the first- and second- place teams would compete in a best-of-five playoff series after the 130-game regular season if five or fewer games separated the two teams. Unpopular with most baseball media and fans, the idea was scrapped after three seasons with a series never needing to be played. The two leagues returned to sending the team with the best regular season record in their respective league to compete against each other in the championship series. =Pacific League playoffs= In February 2003, the PL board of directors agreed to reintroduce a playoff system to be used for the 2004 NPB season. If a first-place team had a substantial lead in the standings nearing the end of the regular season, there was no pennant (league champion) race and little excitement until the Japan Series began. The decision to add a PL playoff was an attempt to rectify this problem and increase the league's popularity. The new postseason plan initiated a two-stage playoff in which the top three PL teams competed. In the First Stage, the teams that finished the newly shortened, 135-game regular season with the second- and third-best records played each other in a best-of- three series. The winner of this series faced the league's top finisher in the second, final stage. The Second Stage winner advanced to the Japan Series, where they competed against the CL's Climax Series champion team. Originally, the top finisher in the league at the end of the season was supposed to receive home-field advantage throughout the Second Stage, but in August 2003, PL officials announced that if the first-place team led the second-place team by more than five games at the end of the regular season, that team would also receive a one-game winning advantage in the Second Stage's best-of-five series. For the 2006 season, PL officials removed the five-game lead requirement in favor of automatically awarding the first-place team the one- win advantage. In conjunction with this change, the first-place team no longer had home-field advantage for the entirety of the Second Stage; instead, the remaining four games were to be split evenly between both teams' stadiums. This rule change became a non-factor after the eventual first-place Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters clinched a Japan Series berth in two straight games. During the three years of the PL's playoff system, the winner of the PL's postseason tournament competed against the CL team who finished the regular season with the best record. The disparity between the two leagues' postseasons provoked some criticism from baseball analysts and insiders. During the 2005 Japan Series, The Japan Times Stephen Ellsesser called NPB's unbalanced postseason a \\"bad system\\" and believed that the CL's decision to not implement a playoff system of their own was \\"foolish\\". Citing the Hanshin Tigers' poor Japan Series performance, he speculated that the CL's lack of postseason play was a disadvantage. Ellsesser believed that the 17 days between their last regular-season game and the first Japan Series game did nothing to prepare the Tigers for the eventual championship series against the Chiba Lotte Marines, who had played continuously. Like Ellsesser, after seeing the \\"excitement\\" that the 2004 PL Playoffs caused, then-Marines manager Bobby Valentine was \\"incredulous that the Central League didn‚Äôt follow suit\\" and create a playoff series of their own. =Climax Series creation= The Tokyo Dome, home of the Yomiuri Giants, hosted the Second Stage of the inaugural Central League Climax Series. The CL had situational playoff scenarios written into its bylaws that required either a tie in the standings or a team with more wins finishing with a worse winning percentage than the top team, but a permanent playoff plan had never been created. In March 2006, encouraged by the success of the PL's playoff series, CL officials announced their intention to introduce postseason playoffs for the 2007 season to help boost declining attendance. During meetings held later that year, PL and CL officials disagreed over proposed plans detailing the new playoff system. Since the creation of the PL playoffs in 2004, the league awarded its pennant titles to the playoff winners rather than the team who finished the regular season with the best record. The PL disapproved of the CL's intentions to continue awarding their league title to the first-place finisher in the regular season while using the playoffs to determine which team would compete against in the Japan Series. In September 2006, both leagues agreed on a unified postseason system. The CL implemented a playoff system identical to the PL's, and the entire playoff series was dubbed the \\"Climax Series\\". The PL agreed to name the regular season first-place finishers league champions rather than the team that won the leagues' respective playoffs‚Äîa reversal from the previous three seasons. It was decided that both leagues would play 144 regular-season games, the first time both leagues would play the same number of games since the PL introduced its playoff system in 2004. The two leagues also agreed that neither regular-season champion should receive a one-game advantage in the Final Stage of the Climax Series, claiming that it was unnecessary from a business point of view. It had been suggested that the Yomiuri Giants voted to approve the playoff idea in 2006 because they had not finished atop the standings in the regular season since 2002 and the playoff concept would increase the Giants' chances of winning the Japan Series. However, the plan backfired on them. In the Climax Series' inaugural season, the Giants finally won the CL pennant but were still denied a Japan Series berth when they were defeated by the second-place Chunichi Dragons in a three-game sweep during the Final Stage of the 2007 Central League Climax Series. The next season, the leagues overturned their decision on the Final Stage advantage and agreed to award their champions a one-win advantage in the Final Stage starting with the 2008 Climax Series. At the same time, the Final Stage changed from a best-of- five series and became a best-of-six series, where the first team to win four games advances to the Japan Series. The 2020 season, shortened to 120 games because of the COVID-19 pandemic, is planned to feature a modified Climax Series. The PL Climax Series will have the season's top-two seeded teams play a best-of-four series, with the league's champion being awarded a one-win advantage. The CL will forgo a playoff series completely, advancing their league champion directly to the Japan Series. The CL's decision to eliminate their Climax Series was due in part to just two of the league's six teams regularly playing in domed stadiums, making it unclear how many games would need to be made-up at the end of the season due to potential rain outs. Current format Both leagues employ the same two-series playoff format, with the top three teams from each league participating in their own two-stage playoff. If two teams vying for a third Climax Series spot finish the regular season with identical records, the team that finished the previous season with a better record is allowed to advance to the playoffs, unless both teams finished with the same previous season record. The First Stage is a best-of- three series involving the regular season's second- and third-place finishers, with all games played at the second-place team's home field. The winner of this series goes on to face the league's pennant-winner in the Final Stage (formerly the \\"Second Stage\\" from 2007 to 2009). This series is best-of-six. The league champion is awarded a one-win advantage as well as home field advantage for the entire series, unlike most professional leagues where a 5-game playoff series runs 2-2-1 or 2-3 or a 7-game playoff series that runs 2-3-2 with the higher seed receiving the extra game. The winning teams advance to the Japan Series, where they compete against one another. Unlike MLB, NPB games may end in a tie if there is no winner after 12 innings of play. If a Climax Series game results in a tie, the win is credited to neither team. If this causes the series to end in a tie, the higher-seeded team advances. Results The League champions were knocked out of the Climax Series and therefore didn't advance to the Japan Series six times total, three times in each the PL and CL. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" + First Stage !

The implementation of a unified playoff system in NPB was generally welcomed. Robert Whiting described its creation as \\"long overdue\\" and believes it stimulates more interest in Japanese baseball. Japanese baseball writer Asa Satoshi believes that while the system isn't perfect, it reduces the number of throwaway dead rubber games played and the need for the system is reinforced by its popularity with fans. Various details in how the system operates has been debated and criticized, however. Satoshi goes on to question the decision to award the league pennant to the team with the highest winning percentage instead of its Climax Series champion. The decision leads to scenarios when a team can be named the best team in Japan after winning the Japan Series, however at the same time the team wasn't crowned the best team in their league. Further, the system allows for teams with sub-.500 winning percentages to qualify for the Climax Series. Satoshi proposes the hypothetical situation in which a team that won less than 50% of their regular-season games won a Japan Series title and questions if they could be rightfully named the best team in Japan. The tiebreaker that determines which team moves on to the Climax Series in the event that two teams end the regular season with the same record has also drawn criticism. Currently, the team that finished higher in the league standings the previous season holds the advantage. This contrasts with Major League Baseball (MLB), which employs a one-game playoff (if only one team advances), or other professional leagues that may use head-to-head season records (and further tiebreakers such as non-interleague play records, second half records, et al.). Former Hiroshima Carp bench coach Jeff Livesey explained that in one instance his team was actually a full game further behind the Hanshin Tigers than the standings showed because unlike the Tigers, the Carp could not enter the Climax Series in the event of a tie. Former player Scott McClain believes that \\"[the tiebreaker] should have nothing to do with last year\\", pointing out that players and managers change from year to year. The Japan Times columnist Wayne Graczyk has suggested that this format be scrapped in favor of MLB's one-game playoff. The most criticized aspect of the Climax Series is the one- game advantage that is awarded to the regular-season champions for the Final Stage. When the rule was implemented the for the 2008 Climax Series, many players reacted negatively with some describing the rule as \\"unfair\\", \\"bad\\", \\"bull\\" and \\"messed up\\". Former player and current manager Alex Ram√≠rez, however, believed that the league champion deserves the advantage. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey believes that the \\"phantom win\\" gives the pennant winner too much of an advantage. According to him, the First Stage bye plus all home games during the Final Stage should be advantage enough for the top-seeded team. He describes the situation as NPB \\"trying to have its cake and eat it too\\" by trying to reap the benefits of a playoff system while also trying to maintain the traditional showdown of pennant winners in the Japan Series. Looking back over the first ten years of the Climax Series, Satoshi believed that it was an ideal form postseason entertainment. Through that time, the league champion won the Climax Series and advanced to the Japan Series almost 82% of the time. He believed this to be the right balance as it maintained the importance of the regular season while also allowing for an occasional surprise that excited fans. In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, this time for allowing games to be called early because of weather and treating them as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end in that manner. He suggested that NPB could have easily suspended the game and resumed where it left off the next day or even postponed the game entirely until the next day. Similarly, in an article for Yahoo Sports, Craig Calcaterra called the Climax Series \\"super unfair\\" after the incident and imagined a similar hypothetical situation in the MLB playoffs and concluded that fans would \\"riot\\".

The district consists of 29 properties containing 27 contributing primary buildings, one contributing site (cemetery), three contributing carriage houses and one non-contributing building in the historic core of the hamlet of Sherwood. It encompasses the entire hamlet and includes several commercial / civic structures at the intersection of New York State Route 34B and Sherwod Road. The structures commemorate the historical Quaker community's dedication to abolition, women's rights, and education. See also: and  History  Sherwood was settled in 1794 on former agricultural lands of the Cayuga people. Access to the area was available via both land and water and was a center for local trade. The community was a mixture of families who were Quakers migrating from surrounding areas and England or freed slaves of African descent and many travelled or had connections to communities outside of Sherwood. The hamlet was shaped by Quaker ideologies which promoted abolition, women's rights and education. Equal rights activities attracted various reformers including: Abby Kelley, Harriet K. Hunt, Mary and Emily Edmondson, Joseph John Gurney, Sojourner Truth, Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, Susan B. Anthony, and Harriet Tubman. On January 20, 1835 both Quakers and African Americans signed the first antislavery petition from Cayuga County and sent to Congress. Residents of the community also participated in the Underground Railroad with freedom seekers either staying in the area or moving on North to Canada. The activism of the community around equal rights lasted long after the Civil War due to rich agricultural land which promoted stable families in the area. Local institutions included the Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union, the Sherwood Political Equality Club, the Sherwood Ramabai Circle, and the Sherwood Select School. While the whole community participated in these movements, it was three generations of the Howland family ‚Äì Slocum Howland, his daughter Emily Howland, his son and daughter-in-law William and Hannah Howland, and his granddaughter Isabel Howland ‚Äì who were among the leaders both locally and nationally. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  Architecture  The district consists of 29 properties, the majority of Sherwood, 10 are related to African Americans, 5 to the Underground Railroad, 16 to Quakers, and 11 to education. Properties were built between the 1820s and 1910 and are one-to-two stories constructed of heavy timber. Architectural styles include Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic, Italianate, Stick Style, and Victorian. Located within the district are the separately listed Howland Cobblestone Store, now a museum which includes a large collection of women‚Äôs rights memorabilia, and Slocum and Hannah Howland House.

He was the most influential teacher of the first generation of American-born professional clarinetists. Biography Daniel Bonade was born in Geneva, Switzerland on April 4, 1896.Daniel Bonade Papers, Special Collections in Performing Arts, University of Maryland, College Park His father, Louis Bonade, was a clarinetist and received the Premier Prix from the Paris Conservatory in 1870. His mother, Esther Poissenot, was a pianist and a vocalist.Jerry Pierce Papers, Special Collections in Performing Arts, University of Maryland, College Park After his father's death, Daniel Bonade began studying the clarinet at age 8 from Ferdinand Capelle. He then studied with Henri Lefebvre, a student of Cyril Rose. In 1910, while studying with Lefebvre, Bonade entered the Paris Conservatory and in 1913 at the age of 18 won the Premier Prix. After completing his education at the Paris Conservatory, Bonade traveled with the Garde Republicane Band as well as freelanced with Ballet Russes, the Sousa Band and other groups. In 1916, Bonade was offered the principal clarinet position of the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Leopold Stokowski. Bonade was with the Philadelphia Orchestra until 1922 when he took a leave of absence for two years due to salary negotiations. He returned to the Orchestra in 1924 and left in 1930 because he thought the Orchestra was not going to survive the stock market crash. Bonade took a position with the Columbia Broadcasting Orchestra until 1933 when he was appointed the principal clarinet position of the Cleveland Orchestra. He remained with the Cleveland Orchestra from 1933 to 1941.Charles P. Schmidt. \\"Bonade, Daniel.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 6 Aug. 2013. . After his stay in Cleveland, Bonade went on tour with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Bonade's playing career was cut short by a heart attack when he was advised by doctors to stop. Bonade would devote his time to teaching clarinet students and playing low-pressure gigs. Bonade and his wife retired to France where he died in Cannes on October 30, 1976. Teaching Bonade was considered to be one of the greatest clarinet teachers of his time. Bonade taught at Curtis Institute of Music from 1924 to 1940, the Cleveland Institute of Music from 1933 to 1942, and the Juilliard School from 1948 to 1960. Bonade continued teaching privately until his death. Bonade's had many successful students. Many of them received principal positions with orchestras or prestigious teaching positions.

It fielded cars between 2009 and 2013. Sprint Cup Series =Car No. 37 history= After the Daytona 500 in 2011, Max Q Motorsports struck a deal with Front Row Motorsports to acquire the No. 37 car. The No. 37 became the primary team for Max Q, with Tony Raines driving. Max Q inherited the owners points from 2010, guaranteeing a spot through the 5th race of 2011, as well as crew chief Greg Connor, the pit crew, and some equipment. The cars are former FRM cars, sourced from the Max Q Motorsports shop and the team has their own personnel. Tony Raines scored top 25 finishes at Phoenix and at Martinsville. The team picked up sponsorship from BlackCat Fireworks for several races during the summer months. The team has started and parked since the 10th race of the season at Darlington after falling out of the top-35 and missing races. Chris Cook drove the No. 37 after a deal with Tomy Drissi and Rick Ware Racing fell through when Drissi was not approved to race at Sonoma. Scott Speed drove the No. 37 at Indy, Pocono, and Watkins Glen, Speed would go on to join Whitney Motorsports full-time following Watkins Glen. Josh Wise made his Sprint Cup debut in the car at Chicago, and has continued to drive for the team following that race. Veteran NASCAR driver Mike Skinner ran the car at Martinsville on October 30, 2011. For 2012, the No. 37 team planned to return full-time in an alliance with Rick Ware Racing. Mike Wallace unsuccessfully attempted the Daytona 500. 2011 Nationwide Series Rookie of the Year Timmy Hill took over in March. The team had full sponsorship from Poynt, a free mobile app available from the App Store. Max Q Motorsports scaled back their schedule in April after the team failed to make five of the first six races, including a disqualification at Martinsville after failing post-qualifying inspection, and a deal for Rick Ware to purchase the team fell through. Their only start was at Las Vegas, where Hill finished 42nd after a crash. Midway through the season they entered into a technical agreement with Tommy Baldwin Racing, signing J. J. Yeley to drive the No. 37. Max Q Motorsports started and parked most of the remainder of the season, but went the distance at Homestead with a 35th-place finish. After 2012, Yeley departed for Tommy Baldwin Racing for the 2013 season. Yeley had start-and-parked for most of 2012 and was quick to take a ride in which he could race full races. With the loss of its fifth primary driver since the team formed in 2009, Max Q effectively shut down before the 2013 season. The No. 37 did make a single appearance at Sonoma, being fielded in an alliance with Baldwin to allow Yeley to race while his regular car, the No. 36, was fielded by Victor Gonzalez, Jr. However, because the team was a late entry, they did not receive driver or owner points. Yeley finished 42nd. In 2014, TBR acquired the No. 37 outright, with Bobby Labonte driving the car at Indianapolis. This officially marked the end of Max Q's participation in NASCAR, because although the 2013 entry had used Max Q's paint style, the 2014 entry used TBR's with Baldwin sponsor Accell Construction on board. =Car No. 64 history= Derrike Cope in the No. 64 at Martinsville Speedway in 2009 The team first attempted to field the No. 64 Toyota at the 2009 Daytona 500 for Geoff Bodine. Although he missed the race, Geoff's brother Todd Bodine made the race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway for the team's first start. The team finished 37th, 58 laps down. Todd would run two other races, garnering a 42nd and 43rd before leaving the team before the first Pocono race. Gunselman then signed Mike Wallace to run a limited schedule the rest of the year. In the remainder of the season, Wallace made two races for the team. His finishes were 43rd and 39th. At Martinsville Speedway, Derrike Cope took over Gunselman's car for one race. The team qualified 43rd and finished 42nd. In 2009, the team made six races in eighteen attempts and did not finish a single one (two engine failures, two brake issues, one crash, and one instance of being parked). The team's first race of 2010 was at Richmond in a Toyota with Tony Raines driving. Chad McCumbee, Landon Cassill, Jeff Green and Todd Bodine also competed for the team. Gunselman Motorsports ran in 2010 as a Start and Park team, with support from Germain Racing. For 2011, Todd Bodine was intended to run with Gunselman for the Daytona 500. However, Germain Racing fielded their own No. 60 Toyota for Bodine. Former Daytona 500 winner Derrike Cope drove the No. 64 Toyota in the Bud Shootout, but failed to qualify the Daytona 500 with sponsorship from Sta-Bil Ethanol Treatment. Max Q would go on to end its affiliation with Germain Racing and Toyota following Daytona. After Daytona, the No. 64 became Max Q‚Äôs secondary team, with the new No. 37 becoming the primary. The team only chose to field the No. 64 one additional time, which was at the Sprint Showdown. Cope again drove the car, but was involved in a crash with Landon Cassill.

R. B. McKerrow, 5 Vols, (Oxford, 1958) I, 169-170 By 1600 a leading member of the Damned Crew was Sir Edmund Baynham (1577 - 1642?), a disaffected Catholic later implicated in the Essex rebellion and the Gunpowder Plot. Baynham had originally been admitted to the Middle Temple in 1595 to study law but soon switched to adventuring. He followed the Earl of Essex on his ill- fated expedition to Ireland and was knighted there by him \\"on the sands\\" just before Essex returned to England. Thereafter, Baynham was among Essex's most loyal supporters. On the night of Tuesday March 18, 1600 Baynham and some others left the Mermaid Tavern at midnight and set off apparently looking for trouble. They \\"cast off their cloaks and upper garments, drew rapiers and daggers, marched through the streets\\" and when challenged by the watch they attacked. After a scuffle they were overpowered, disarmed and marched to the Counter prison, Baynham shouting that \\"he cared not a fart for the lord mayor or any magistrate in London.\\" Instead of being tried by the ordinary London authorities however they were remitted to Star Chamber on the personal intervention of the Queen, \\"for the more exemplar punishment of so great and outrageous disorder.\\" Having at first denied the charges they changed their plea to guilty, \\"confessed their faults and submitted themselves to the court, and proved that all was done in drink and heat.\\" They were fined ¬£200 and imprisoned.The House of Commons 1558 - 1603, ed.

The farms include the Elmwood Farm, the Broyles Farm, the Crum Farm, and the Jim Earnest Farm, all of which were initially developed by early pioneer Henry Earnest (1732-1809) and his descendants in the late-18th and 19th centuries. The district includes the Ebenezer Methodist Church, which is home to the oldest Methodist congregation in Tennessee, and the Earnest Fort House, which is one of the oldest houses in the state. Elmwood Farm has been designated a century farm and is one of the oldest farms in Tennessee, having been cultivated continuously since 1777. Henry Earnest settled along the banks of the Nolichucky River in 1774 and built the Earnest Fort House on a bluff overlooking the river in 1782. Earnest donated the land for the Ebenezer Methodist Church, which was completed in 1795 and ordained that same year by Bishop Francis Asbury. When Earnest died in 1809, his land was divided up among his children, with his son Peter receiving what is now the Elmwood Farm and son Henry Earnest, Jr. receiving what is now the Broyles Farm. Throughout the 19th century, the Earnests operated their farms as small business enterprises, selling much of their produce for profits. In the early 20th century, the Broyles family purchased the Henry Earnest, Jr. Farm and in subsequent years converted it into a dairy farming operation. The historic district contains 43 contributing structures or sites. Geographic layout The Nolichucky River bends in a half-rectangle around the Earnest Farms Historic District, forming its eastern, northern, and western boundaries, the exception being the Earnest Fort House, which lies immediately north of the river. The Crum Farm is the easternmost farm in the district, with the Nolichucky running along its eastern and northern boundaries. The Broyles Farm is immediately west of the Crum Farm, and Elmwood Farm is immediately west of the Broyles Farm. The Jim Earnest Farm is immediately southwest of Elmwood, with the river flowing along the western boundary of the Elmwood and Jim Earnest farms. The southern boundaries of all four farms collectively provide the district's southern boundary. Tennessee State Route 351 (known locally as Chuckey Pike) traverses Elmwood Farm north- to-south, connecting the area with the Chuckey community across the river to the north and the Cherokee National Forest to the south. Along the south boundary of the Elmwood Farm, TN-351 gradually ascends to the top of a hill, from which there is a dramatic view of the Bald Mountains spanning the horizon to the south. Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park, the traditional birthplace of frontiersman Davy Crockett, lies along the east bank of the Nolichucky opposite the Crum Farm. History The Earnest Fort House, built in 1782 Henry Earnest was born Heinrich Ernst in Dattlikon, Switzerland in 1732, and immigrated with his parents to Virginia in the 1740s. After serving with the Virginia militia in the French and Indian War, he married Mary Stephens, the daughter of his benefactor, in the 1760s, and migrated southwestward.David Taylor, The Henry Earnest Family, A Biographical Report . TNGenWeb.org, 2001. Retrieved: 2009-11-12. By 1774, he had arrived in what is now Greene County. The Earnests supported the Patriot cause during the American Revolution, and Earnest's son, Felix, fought at the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780. The Earnests also played a role in the creation of Greene County in 1783, and Henry Earnest served as the county's first tax assessor. Elmwood Farm fields Earnest built the Earnest Fort House in 1782, and developed the adjacent land into a profitable farm. He began work on the Henry and Peter Earnest House (across the river from the fort house) around 1800. Upon his death in 1809, his farm was divided up among his children, with his son Peter (1777-1862) inheriting what is now Elmwood, his son Henry, Jr. (1772-1851) inheriting what is now the Broyles Farm, and his son Felix (1762-1842) inheriting what is now the Jim Earnest Farm. Peter renovated and expanded the house his father had built, and Henry Earnest, Jr. built a similarly-designed house (now the Earnest-Broyles House) during the same period. Peter, Henry, Jr., and their brother Jacob were all listed as merchants throughout the first half of the 19th century, and their names consistently appear in the ledgers of a general store in Leesburg, (near Jonesborough). Felix Earnest was a minister and leader in the Methodist Church, having been ordained a deacon by Bishop Francis Asbury in 1806 and elevated to Elder by Joshua Soule in 1825.Richard Doughty, Greeneville: One Hundred Year Portrait (1775-1875) (Greeneville, Tenn.: Doughty, 1975), pp. 112-113. Henry Earnest, Jr. represented Greene County in the state senate 1811-1813, and became a charter board member of Tusculum College upon its founding in 1818. When the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad completed tracks through Chuckey in the 1850s, Peter Earnest established a toll bridge to connect the Earnest farms to the railroad. While the Earnests were slave owners, two members of the Earnest family, listed as \\"B Earnest\\" and \\"N Earnest,\\" were part of the Greene County delegation to the East Tennessee Convention at Greeneville on the eve of the Civil War in June 1861.Proceedings of the E.T. Convention: Held at Knoxville, May 30th and 31st, 1861 and at Greeneville, on the 17th day of June, 1861, and following days (Knoxville, Tenn.: H. Barry's Book and Job Office, 1861). Reproduced on Microform by Greenwood Press, Westport, Conn., 1970-1979. The Earnest farms survived the war mostly intact, although the local economy was in ruins. The toll bridge was replaced in 1869, and again in 1903. In the 1940s, the Broyles family (who had purchased the Henry Earnest, Jr. properties) established a large dairy complex on the Broyles farm, mainly to take advantage of a Pet Milk condensing plant that had been established in Greeneville, although the dairy operation ultimately failed. Today, tobacco is the chief crop of the Elmwood, Broyles, and Crum farms. =Ebenezer Methodist Church= Ebenezer Methodist Church Sometime in the early 1790s, the Earnests and several other area families formed a Methodist society. Methodist circuit rider Francis Asbury delivered a sermon before 200 people at \\"Squire Earnest's\\" in 1793, and mentioned that a society of 31 members had been formed. The Earnests eventually donated a parcel of land (between the river and the Jim Earnest Farm) for the construction of a meeting house. On April 27, 1795, Asbury dedicated the new meeting house, marking the beginning of the Ebenezer Methodist Church. The current Ebenezer Methodist Church building, built on the site of the 1795 meeting house, was completed in 1899. The church is a one- story framed structure, with a metal gabled roof. The exterior walls were originally weatherboarded, but this has been replaced with vinyl siding. The building has a gabled, metal roof and a concrete block foundation. The church's louvered bell tower is two stories, and contains a bell purchased from the Cincinnati Bell Foundry. The interior includes the original wooden siding, hand-painted doors and pews, and a stained glass window. The church's cemetery, which also listed as a contributing property in the historic district, contains the burials of several Earnests and other families associated with church, and at least two slave burials (known only as \\"Zona\\" and \\"Corby\\"). Notable historical structures =Elmwood Farm= The Henry and Peter Earnest House, initially built in 1800 and expanded in 1820 What is now the Elmwood Farm was part of the land inherited by Peter Earnest from his father, Henry, in 1809. Upon Peter Earnest's death in 1862, the farm passed to his son, Benjamin, and upon Benjamin's death in 1887, it passed to Benjamin's son Nicholas Earnest. Nicholas Earnest managed Elmwood until his death in 1956, when it was divided among his six children. His daughter, Katherine Earnest Clemmer, then purchased her siblings' share of the farm. Elmwood is the only farm in the district that remains in the hands of Earnest descendants, and in 2002 was designated a Tennessee Century Farm. It is the second-oldest farm in the state, behind only the Masengill Farm in Sullivan County.Tennessee Century Farms , Vol. 5, Issue 2 (Winter 2008), p. 3. Retrieved: 2009-11-13. The farm's eleven contributing structures include: *The Earnest Fort House, also called the Mauris-Earnest Fort House, a three-story structure completed in 1782 or 1783. The first-story walls were built out of limestone blocks, and the second and third stories were built using logs connected with \\"V\\" notches. This building was originally added to the National Register of Historic Places in a separate listing in 1978. *The Henry and Peter Earnest House, a two-story brick Federal-style I-house begun in the early 19th century (or possibly earlier) and expanded over subsequent decades. Henry Earnest built the rear wing of the house around 1800, and Peter Earnest added the Federal-style front facade in 1820, creating the I-house formation, and added a smokehouse and slave quarters to the rear. An open-air porch was added to the east side of the rear wing in the 1850s, and a Colonial Revival- style portico was added to the west side in the 1920s. *The Earnest Bridge Substructure, a stone bridge abutment rising out of the middle of the river immediately west of the modern TN-351 bridge. The abutment was built in 1903 using stones from 1869 Earnest toll bridge. *A two-story brick smokehouse, located just west of the Henry and Peter Earnest House, built around 1820 for use as a smokehouse, but later used for milk storage when dairy operations were established at the farm. The smokehouse has a cantilevered shed roof. =Broyles Farm= The Broyles Farm was originally part of the land inherited by Henry Earnest, Jr. from his father in 1809. The Broyles family purchased the farm in 1903. The farm's eighteen contributing structures include: *The Earnest-Broyles House, a two-story brick Federal-style I-house originally built by Henry Earnest, Jr. in 1820. The house has a Colonial Revival- influenced portico and a Federal-influence interior. *A two-story frame tobacco barn, built around 1940. *A board-and-batten stock/tobacco barn, built around 1920. The barn was originally built to house livestock, but is now used for tobacco. *Three concrete silos, one built in the 1940s, and two (side-by- side) built in the 1950s. The older silo no longer has its dome roof, while the two newer silos have dome metal roofs. *A two-story concrete structure originally used as a milk house for the farm's dairy operations, but later used as a tenant house. =Crum Farm= Crum Farm, viewed from a bluff along the Nolichucky River The Crum Farm is a tobacco farm developed in the 1920s. The Crum Farm's eight contributing structures include: *The Crum Bungalow, a 1.5-story house built around 1920. The house has a metal roof and brick foundation. *A board-and-batten chicken coop, built around 1930. This building design may have been influenced by designs provided by the University of Tennessee in the 1920s. *A board-and-batten wood shop, built around 1920. =Jim Earnest Farmstead= The Jim Earnest Farmstead is part of the land inherited by Felix Earnest from his father, Henry Earnest, in 1809. After Felix Earnest's death in 1841, the farm passed to his two sons, James Oliphant Earnest and William McKendrie Earnest. The latter's son, Jim Harvey Earnest, inherited the farm in 1902, and managed it until the 1930s. The farmstead has four contributing structures: *The Jim Earnest House, a three-story Folk Victorian style house built around 1880. A central projecting bay on the front facade resembles Italianate tower designs. The house has weatherboard siding and an asphalt shingle roof. *A one-story board-and-batten tobacco barn, built circa 1920. *A one-story tenant house, built circa 1900, with a metal roof added in the 1920s. *A board-and-batten storage shed, built around 1920.

One highlight is its collection of fijnschilder paintings from the Dutch Golden Age. The museum regularly hosts visiting art exhibitions and has a caf√©. History of the building The museum building was erected in 1640 by Arent van 'Gravesande as a cloth hall (lakenhal in Dutch) - a guild hall for cloth merchants. The museum was founded in 1874 as a stedelijk museum (municipal museum.) Museum entrance in the former Cloth Hall - 1642 painting by the Leiden architectural painter Susanna van Steenwijk. The eastern expansion had not yet been realized. Collections Like other municipal museums in the Netherlands, it became a repository for municipal art collections. Artifacts from Leiden are on display such as a series of stained glass windows by Willem Thibaut commissioned for the Leiden city hall, are now installed in the stairwells. On permanent display is also the old inspection room or Staalmeesterskamer where cloth was inspected and the meeting hall where disputes were decided. Four large paintings depicting the cloth industry by Isaac van Swanenburg hang in the same spots on the walls as designed. Similarly, a very grand over-the-mantel piece by Carel de Moor shows the inspectors in a massive wooden frame decorated with their family shields, flanked by a series of three historical allegories of the city of Leiden by Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel. The museum hosts a collection of altarpieces and religious artifacts from before the Protestant Revolution that were formally ceded to the state in 1572. The museum also includes a reconstructed statie or Catholic mission station from after the Reformation. Because the Catholic religion was banned, there was no official church and all of the Catholic places of worship in the young Dutch Republic were called mission stations. These were semi-hidden churches that were tolerated and taxed by the state. Minerva Crowns the Maid of Leiden, one of a series of three grand paintings for the Lakenhal in 1650 by Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel.

It was adapted into a theatre production by the author in 2003, with Danielle Darieux and Anny Duperey in France, Jacqueline Bir in Belgium, and Rita Lafontaine in Quebec, and then to the movies in 2009 with Mich√®le Laroque who was Grandma (Granny Pink or Mamie-Rose).  Summary  Visit of the practitioner and the nurse in pink (Marie-Claire Lef√©bure). A young boy named Oscar lives in the hospital, because he suffers from a type of cancer. He writes letters to God to talk about his life at the hospital. = Synopsis = Oscar, a ten-year-old boy, lives in a children's hospital, with volunteer nurses called \\"Pink Ladies\\" and Mamie-Rose, being the oldest Pink Lady. She is retired but still actively volunteering with this group. After a failed bone marrow transplant, he thinks he is doomed. He talks about his future death to his family and staff. All turn a deaf ear to the word \\"death\\" with the exception of Mamie-Rose, formerly called \\"Strangler of Languedoc\\" thanks to her skills as a wrestler, which she confirms that he will die. Mamie-Rose then proposes to write letters to God by writing a wish of \\"feeling\\" every day. The next day, Oscar's parents come to the hospital and learn from Doctor D√ºsseldorf that Oscar is indeed sentenced and that he will die in 12 days. They do not even want to kiss their son. Oscar, who overheard this conversation, is furious and calls them \\"cowards\\". He does not want to see his parents anymore. At the end of the day, Mamie-Rose comes to visit Oscar and tells him that she has been allowed to visit him for the next 12 days. She invents a game that will allow him to enjoy her life at any age: every day for him will have a duration of 10 years. Oscar accepts and asks in his letter to God to visit him. During his \\"adolescence\\" (the next day), Oscar admits to Mamie-Rose that he really likes a girl named Peggy Blue. Will Oscar confess his feelings? Will he reconcile with his parents? The book explains his passage from atheism to belief, and from selfishness to altruism.  The letters (each chapter)  = First letter = In the first letter, Oscar presents Mamie-Rose: she was, she says, a wrestler named \\"Strangler of Languedoc\\". Now she is incredibly old, too much to work as a Pink Lady. Unlike the rest of the hospital staff, Mamie-Rose does not try to deny that Oscar has only a short time to live so she can talk to him about his death with her. = Second letter = As Oscar is sick, his parents visit him only on Sunday. One day, his parents come to the hospital, on a day that isn't Sunday, as usual, and instead of visiting him, without even greeting Oscar, they talk to Dr. D√ºsseldorf, who tells them that the death of Oscar is inevitable. His parents are so depressed to go see him after learning that there is no chance to save him. Unfortunately, by hiding behind the door, Oscar has secretly heard the conversation and is disappointed by his parents, whom he calls cowardly. Later, he talks to Mamie-Rose about his problems with his parents and tells her that he hates them. In addition, Oscar asks her to come and see him every day and she actually gets permission to do so. To help Oscar enjoy the rest of his life, Mamie-Rose invents a game: from this day, every day counts for ten years; in this way, he has the opportunity to experience all stages of life. He does this during the last twelve days of the year. = Third letter = During his adolescence, he falls in love with Peggy Blue, a girl who has a blood problem that makes her all blue. Oscar makes the decision to protect her from the ghosts, but Popcorn, jealous, says Peggy Blue is his and tells Oscar to \\"take\\" Sandrine, which she is really interested in Oscar. He goes to see Sandrine and she kisses him just as his parents arrive. But Oscar does not want to see them and he ignores them while listening to music: Nutcracker. After their visit, Mamie-Rose gives him the courage to tell Peggy that he finds her beautiful by saying that Popcorn \\"bluffs\\". Oscar and Peggy end up kissing each other and he asks God to marry her. = Fourth letter = At age thirty, Oscar marries Peggy. During the night Oscar hears noises and thinks there are ghosts who are torturing Peggy so he gets up to see if it's her screaming. It's Bacon, a burnt kid screaming because of his burns. Finally, Peggy allows Oscar to sleep with her, but the medical staff do not agree. They must be sanctioned at night due to their illnesses. Fortunately, Mamie-Rose arrives to defend the children. Mamie-Rose brings Oscar to the chapel to show him that death must not be a moral suffering. In addition, he asks God that Peggy's operation is going well. = Fifth letter = Peggy Blue is operated on this day. The operation is successful, the doctors say that over the days it will become more and more pink. Then Oscar meets his in-laws, whom he treats with great respect. Finally, when they leave, they entrust their daughter. That day is a family day, Oscar sympathizes with his in-laws and he adopts Mamie-Rose, as he did with Bernard, his teddy bear. At the end of this day, he is 40 years old. = Sixth letter = When the \\"Chinese\\" (Sandrine) tells Popcorn that she and Oscar have kissed, Popcorn reports it to Peggy who breaks up with Oscar although he tries to defend himself. Brigitte, a child with Down syndrome, comes to his room and kisses him. The whole floor treats him of cavalry because of that. But Oscar still loves Peggy and Mamie-Rose is trying to give him courage. At the end of the day, he is 50 years old. = Seventh letter = On Christmas Day, Oscar is reconciled with Peggy Blue, but as his parents come to celebrate Christmas with him, he can not stay with her. At the thought of having to spend this evening with his parents who will offer him a lot of gifts, he organizes his fugue. After bartering with Einstein, Bacon and Popcorn, they agree to help him hide in Mamie-Rose's car. When he rings at his door after a nap in the car, she is surprised and she persuades him to phone his parents who seek him. Then, they spend a merry Christmas together. Mamie-Rose even offers a small statue of the Virgin because she thinks she looks like Peggy. At Mamie-Rose's request, they watch Midnight Mass on television and also a wrestling match she recorded. That day, Oscar learns that his parents have forgotten that they are doomed to die too. This confidence improves the relationship between the child and his parents. = Eighth, ninth, and tenth letter = From age 70 to 80, Oscar spends time thinking. Of course, Mamie-Rose helps him think. Finally Oscar takes the debt of Dr. D√ºsseldorf who has feelings of guilt because he can not cure him. Then comes a difficult time that begins for him, because Peggy's operation is successful and she goes home with her parents. = Eleventh letter = Finally Oscar receives the visit of God at dawn, when he repels the night. At that moment, Oscar understands the difference between God and men: God is tireless and men are never tired. In addition, God tells him his secret: \\"to look at the world every day as if it were the first time\\" and Oscar follows his advice. = Twelfth letter = At one hundred years old, he tries to explain to his parents that life is a strange gift. At first, we overestimate her and we believe that we will live forever, then we underestimate her and finds her rotten and too short and finally we learn that she is not a gift, but just a loan, so we need we appreciate it. = Thirteenth letter = Oscar is one hundred and ten years old, and admits, \\"I think I'm starting to die\\". This is the last letter he writes. He dies at the end of this letter. = Fourteenth letter = This time it's Mamie-Rose who is writing instead of Oscar. She tells God that Oscar died and died while his family went to have coffee. He did that while they were there to avoid the violence of that moment. She says she can not compare her grief with the insurmountable one of Oscar's parents. At the end of the letter, she says that he had deposited the word on his table for three days: \\"Only God has the right to wake me up\\". He becomes a believer in God.

He was also briefly in the household of Henry's son Henry the Young King. Barre served the elder Henry as a diplomat and was involved in a minor way with the king's quarrel with Thomas Becket, which earned Barre a condemnation from Becket. After King Henry's death, Barre became a royal justice during Richard's reign and was one of the main judges in the period from 1194 to 1199. After disagreeing with him earlier in his career, Barre was discharged from his judgeship during John's reign as king. Barre was also archdeacon of Ely and the author of a work of biblical extracts dedicated to one of his patrons, William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely and Chancellor of England. Early life Whether Barre was a native of England or of Normandy is unknown, but his surname appears to derive from the Norman village of La Barre, near Bernay, in the present-day department of Eure. He was likely born around 1130 and was related to Normandy's Sifrewast family, knights in Berkshire. Barre had a relative, Hugh Barre, who was Archdeacon of Leicester in the 1150s. Barre studied law at Bologna in Italy before 1150 and was a student there with Stephen of Tournai, who became Bishop of Tournai in 1192. Another fellow student wrote a short verse addressed to Barre: \\"Pontificum causas regumque negocia tractes, Qui tibi divicias deliciasque parant\\", which translates to \\"May you manage the causes of bishops and the affairs of kings, Who provide riches and delights for you.\\"Quoted and translated in Duggan \\"Roman, Canon, and Common Law\\" Historical Research p. 26 After finishing his schooling, Barre seems to have worked for either Robert de Chesney, the Bishop of Lincoln, or Nicholas, Archdeacon of Huntingdon; the main evidence for this is that Barre witnessed charters for both men from 1160 to 1164. By 1165, Barre had joined the household of King Henry II of England.Turner \\"Richard Barre and Michael Belet\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law pp. 182‚Äì185 Service to King Henry Barre served King Henry during the king's quarrel with Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had gone into exile in 1164 over the dispute about the limits of royal authority over the English Church.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 192‚Äì195 Because of Barre's close ties to King Henry, Becket considered him one of the king's \\"evil counselors\\", and Barre was the subject of denunciations by the archbishop. In late August 1169, Barre was in Normandy with Henry, where Barre was part of a group of ecclesiastics advising the king on how to resolve the Becket dispute.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 189 In September 1169, Barre was sent along with two other clerks to Rome to complain about the behaviour of papal envoys during negotiations with Becket held at the beginning of September. The papal negotiators at first agreed to a compromise, but the next day claimed that the proposal was unacceptable. With the failure of the negotiations, Becket restored the sentences of excommunication on a number of royal officials, but Barre was not included among those specifically named even though many of his colleagues were. The historian Frank Barlow argues that Barre was not specifically named in the restoration of excommunications, as Becket considered him already excommunicated because of his association with those under the church's ban.Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 190‚Äì192 During January and February 1170 the king sent Barre on a diplomatic mission to the pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket.Turner \\"Richard Barre and Michael Belet\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law pp. 186‚Äì187 The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation of the right of the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir.Warren Henry II pp. 501‚Äì502 Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 204 After Becket's murder in December 1170 King Henry sent Barre to Rome, accompanied by the Archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of √âvreux and Worcester, and other royal clerks, to plead the royal case with the papacy.Warren Henry II p. 305 The mission's objective was to make it clear to Alexander that Henry had had nothing to do with Becket's murder and that the king was horrified that it had taken place. Barre was at first refused a meeting with Alexander, but eventually the envoys were allowed to meet with the pope. Although the mission was not a complete success, the royal commission did manage to persuade the papacy not to impose an interdict, or ban on clerical rites, on England or to excommunicate the king.Coredon Dictionary of Medieval Terms & Phrases p. 164 Shortly afterwards Barre was granted the office of Archdeacon of Lisieux, probably as a reward for his efforts in Rome in 1171. In September he was named a royal justice.Sharpe \\"Richard Barre's Compedium\\" Journal of Medieval Latin p. 128 He was named chancellor to King Henry's eldest living son Henry for a brief period in 1172 and 1173, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father and sought refuge at the French royal court, Barre refused to join him in exile and returned to the king's service. Barre took with him the younger Henry's seal. In addition to the Lisieux archdeaconry, Barre held the prebend of Hurstborne and Burbage in the Diocese of Salisbury from 1177Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 4: Salisbury: Prebendaries of Hurstborne and Burbage and the prebend of Moreton and Whaddon in the Diocese of Hereford from 1180 through 1184.Barrow Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 8: Hereford: Prebendaries of Moreton and Whaddon He continued to hold the archdeaconry at Lisieux until 1188,Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066‚Äì1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Ely: Archdeacons of Ely and was at Lisieux for most of the late 1170s and 1180s.Sharpe \\"Richard Barre's Compendium\\" Journal of Medieval Latin p. 129 In 1179 he was at Rouen for the display of the body of Saint Romanus and was one of the witnesses to the event. While holding his Norman archdeaconry, he gave land to the abbey of St-Pierre-sur-Dives along with Ralph, Bishop of Lisieux.Spear Personnel of the Norman Cathedrals pp. 176‚Äì177 In February or March 1198, King Henry sent Barre on a diplomatic mission to the continent with letters to Frederick Barbarossa, the German Emperor, Bela II, the King of Hungary, and Isaac II Angelos, the Emperor at Constantinople,Neocleous \\"Byzantines and Saladin\\" Al-Masaq p. 214 seeking assistance for his projected crusade.Warren Henry II p. 607 Barre carried letters to the three rulers requesting passage through their lands and the right to procure supplies. Nothing came of this mission, as Henry died in 1189 before the crusade could set off.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 113 Later years and death After the death of King Henry, Barre joined the service of William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre as Archdeacon of Ely, with the appointment occurring before 4 July 1190. Longchamp sent Barre as a royal justice to the counties near Ely in 1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince John during Richard's absence on the Third Crusade.Barlow Feudal Kingdom of England pp. 373‚Äì376 Longchamp's exile meant that Barre did not serve as a royal justice again until King Richard I returned to England in 1194. Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he did not return to his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence. Barre was one of the main royal justices between 1194 and 1199.Turner \\"Richard Barre and Michael Belet\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law pp. 188‚Äì189 He also served as a lawyer for the new Bishop of Ely, Eustace, who was elected in August 1197.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 244 But Barre had incurred the hostility of the king's younger brother Prince John, and when John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, Barre ceased to be employed as a royal justice, instead returning to Ely and business in his clerical office. His last sure mention in the historical record is on 9 August 1202, when he was serving as a judge-delegate for Pope Innocent III, but he may have been alive as late as 1213, as he was part of a papal panel deciding a case that can only be securely dated to between 1198 and 1213.Turner \\"Richard Barre and Michael Belet\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law p. 190 Barre maintained his friendship with Stephen of Tournai, who corresponded with him later in their lives.Turner \\"Richard Barre and Michael Belet\\" Judges, Administrators and the Common Law p. 196 Literary work Barre wrote a work on the Bible entitled Compendium de veteri et novo testamento, which he dedicated to Longchamp. The work arranged passages from the Bible under topics, and then annotated the passages with marginal notations such as were done with glosses on Roman law. It is still extant in two manuscript (MS) copies, MS British Library Harley 3255, and Lambeth Palace MS 105.Rigg \\"Barre, Richard\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The Harley manuscript is shorter than the Lambeth manuscript. Richard Sharpe, a modern historian who studied both works, stated that the Harley manuscript \\"provides [a] well structured and systematic (though not complete) coverage of the whole Bible.\\" Because of the dedication to William Longchamp as \\"bishop, legate, and chancellor\\", it is likely that the work was composed between January 1190 and October 1191, as Longchamp only held those three offices together during that period.Sharpe \\"Richard Barre's Compendium\\" Journal of Medieval Latin p. 134 The prologue to the work describes it as something to be used privately, and thus Sharpe feels that it was not intended to be a publicly published work; instead Barre may have intended it for Longchamp's private use in preparing sermons.Sharpe \\"Richard Barre's Compendium\\" Journal of Medieval Latin pp. 135‚Äì138 A third copy of Barre's Compendium may have existed at Leicester Abbey, where a late 15th- century library catalogue records a work by Barre on the Bible that the catalogue titles \\"Compendium Ricardi Barre super utroque testamento\\". The title and contents make this manuscript likely to be a copy of the Compendium. The same catalogue also records five books once owned by Barre ‚Äì copies of Gratian's Decretum, Justinian's Codex, glossed copies of the Psalter and some of the Epistles of Paul, as well as Peter Lombard's Sentences. Also, another Leicester Abbey manuscript records some satirical verses that were said to have been written by Barre.

He was a Knight of Justice (Rechtsritter) of the Order of Saint John. Family He was descended from a family that probably originated from Gosel in the Egerland and emigrated to G√ºrth (now in Bad Brambach) before 1630. He was the son of Karl Gustav von Go√üler (1810‚Äì1885), the Kanzler (in this case, provincial justice minister) of the province East Prussia, legal advisor to the crown and President of the Oberlandesgericht in K√∂nigsberg, and Sophie von M√ºhler (1816‚Äì1877), who was the daughter of the Prussian Justice minister Heinrich Gottlob von M√ºhler (1780‚Äì1857). This marriage produced four children: the Prussian Minister of State and Oberpr√§sident of the province of West Prussia, Gustav (1838‚Äì1902), the Prussian Minister of War and General of the Infantry, Heinrich (1841‚Äì1927), the Prussian General of the Infantry, Konrad (1848‚Äì1933), and the Prussian Lieutenant General, Wilhelm von Go√üler (1850‚Äì1928). On 31 August 1872, Gossler married Emma von Sperber (born 14 November 1848; died 3 October 1914), the daughter of the landowner Eugen von Sperber, and of Emilie Donalitius. Military career Go√üler joined the 1st Infantry Regiment in 1860, became a Second Lieutenant in 1861 and took part in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. He also fought in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870‚Äì1871, with distinction. After the war, he was assigned to the Ministry of War as a Captain until 1875. He then commanded a company in the 2nd Grenadier Regiment until 1878, when he was once again moved to the War Ministry, to the Department for Army Affairs. Here he was later made a member of the higher examination commission. In 1885 Go√üler became a department head in the War Ministry. After being appointed a colonel in 1888, commander of the 3rd Guard Regiment in 1889 and a Major General and brigade commander in 1891, he was made Director of the General War Department in the War Ministry in October 1891 and simultaneously, representing the War Minister, a member of the Defence Commission. He was also the deputy plenipotentiary in the Bundesrat, chairman of the Reichsrayonkommission and a member of a disciplinary commission. Go√üler was a Lieutenant General after 1895 and commanded the 25th Division in Darmstadt. On 14 August 1896 he was appointed Prussian Minister of War, and in September was also made the Prussian plenipotentiary in the Bundesrat. On 15 August 1903 he retired, having been made a General of the Infantry in 1899. ¬ß 1841 births 1927 deaths German untitled nobility Generals of Infantry (Prussia) Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (W√ºrttemberg) Grand Crosses of the Friedrich Order ","title":"Heinrich von Gossler"},{"id":"25082181","title":"Ana de Armas"},{"id":"25082195","text":"Eilean M√≤r is an island in Loch Langavat on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.

A right-handed pitcher, he stood and weighed . Born in Hindsboro, Illinois, he was the father of professional baseball pitcher Rich Hyde. Professional career After going to tryout camps for the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals in 1947, Hyde was signed by the Washington Senators in 1949, pitching for their D level (then lowest) minor league team that year and the next before military service in Korea, followed by two more seasons of minor league ball for Washington. By 1954, Hyde had made very little progress in Washington's farm system. One day after watching him throw, Calvin Griffith suggested Hyde might become more effective if he came down a little in his pitching motion when he threw. Hyde eventually adopted the submarine style of pitching. While he made three appearances with the Senators in 1955, Hyde spent all of 1956 in the minors and it was only in 1957 that he established himself in the major leagues. His best year was 1958, when he went 10‚Äì3 with 19 saves and a 1.75 earned run average. He also finished 12th in the voting for Most Valuable Player.

Joint Professional Military Education was established following greater awareness during World War II of a need for effective cooperation between the branches of the United States armed forces. While some institutions had previously served to provide joint training, notably the Army and Navy Staff College that operated in the last years of the War, the first senior school for Joint Professional Military Education was founded in 1946 under the direction of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The 1986 passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act caused increased interest in Joint Professional Military Education and created a standard. As of 2005, JPME contains five levels, successful completion of two of which are among the qualifications for the designation Joint Service Officer. Joint Professional Military Education levels are available at a number of colleges and JPME Institutions. History Prior to World War II, the branches of the United States military generally trained their staff independently, but new demands for collaborative efforts by services dedicated to ground, sea and air made clear the need for joint education. In December 1942, Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, General Hap Arnold, proposed a War College that might train officers for joint operations between the United States Army and Navy and develop new methods and doctrines for cooperative efforts during the war. To meet this need, in 1943, Arnold and his fellow Joint Chiefs of Staff established a temporary Army and Navy Staff College that provided four-month courses for officers through the end of the war. During its operation, the Army and Navy Staff College's commandant, Lieutenant General John Dewitt was invited to lead a panel to develop recommendations for the future of joint military education, and the panel recommended the establishment of a national university that would incorporate a joint industrial college, joint war college and State Department college.Yaeger, 77. At the same time, the Special Committee for Reorganization of the National Defense headed by Navy Admiral James Richardson (the Richardson Committee) began conducting national interviews that led to a highly controversial recommendation for a unified armed forces as well as a list of \\"three basic requirements\\" for joint military education and training: (1) adequate training to allow juniors to cooperatively enact joint plans, (2) joint education to allow officers to work together in drafting and enacting joint plans, and (3) joint education to allow officers at high levels to formulate and command large-scale, joint operations.Yaeger, 78. While the United States Congress set about the slow course to developing the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other military personnel were at work attempting to structure joint military education.Yaeger, 79. The first few years after the war saw significant movement in these efforts. In 1946, the National War College‚Äîthe first senior school for JPME under the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff‚Äîwas founded, as one of the recommendations by a study headed by Lieutenant General Leonard Gerow.Yaeger, 79-80. That same year,the Armed Forces Staff College (renamed in 2000 the Joint Forces Staff College (JFSC)) was opened under operation of the Chief of Naval Operations, \\"to train selected officers of the armed forces in joint operations.\\"Yaeger, 81. Two years later, the recently renamed Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) was also a designated a \\"joint educational institution\\" and put under the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When, in 1976 a National Defense University (NDU) was created to provide structure to military education, the National War College and Industrial College of the Armed Forces were its first two constituents for joint military education. In 1981, the Armed Forces Staff College was also assigned to NDU. Ongoing challenges in United States military preparedness for joint action was highlighted by 1980's Operation Eagle Claw, and events such as the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing emphasized the need for proper cooperative training. The 1986 passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act meant to help overcome barriers between intraservice cooperation popularized JPME by making it a requirement for becoming a Joint Staff Officer.Simons, p. 165 The Act also mandated standards for JPME education. JPME levels There are five levels of JPME defined by the Officer Professional Military Education Policy issued in December 2005: # preparatory JPME taught to undergraduates and during primary military education; # Phase I taught at intermediate and senior levels; # Phase II; # single-phase programs offered at select institutions; and # General/Field Officer course. Successful completion of both Phase I and Phase II of the JPME are among the qualifications for the designation Joint Staff Officer (JSO). Program for Joint Education The Program for Joint Education (PJE) is an umbrella term used to refer to the approach utilized in JPME. Multiple aspects of Joint Professional Military Education are encompassed in the term; curricula, standards and education objectives are a component of PJE, as are the ratio of military branches represented among students and faculty and the ratio of student to faculty. The PJE is assessed through the Program for Accreditation of Joint Education (PAJE) administered by PAJE teams appointed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Muhleman, 109. Institutions Under the umbrella of the National Defense University (NDU), JPME is offered by a number of joint colleges and four JPME institutions: the National War College, the College of Information and Cyberspace, the College of International Security Affairs, the Eisenhower School, and the Joint Forces Staff College. These institutions maintain a joint focus and a multiple- service student body and faculty. A number of schools, including the NDU and Military Service Colleges, are approved to provide JPME Phase I credits to their student bodies.Kirby et al, 5. While formerly JPME Phase II credits were available at a very limited number of schools, recent changes in regulations have expanded their availability. As of 2006, the Joint Forces Staff College was approved to provide Phase II credits, including through its Joint & Combined Warfighting School, while the National War College and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces were entitled to offer both Phase I and Phase II. By 2007, the U.S. Army War College, the College of Naval Warfare of the Naval War College, Marine Corps War College and the Air War College were all accredited to offer both Phase I and II.

The need for such a design arises when an aircraft is required to operate consistently in the supersonic flight regime. Supersonic airfoils generally have a thin section formed of either angled planes or opposed arcs (called \\"double wedge airfoils\\" and \\"biconvex airfoils\\" respectively), with very sharp leading and trailing edges. The sharp edges prevent the formation of a detached bow shock in front of the airfoil as it moves through the air.Courant & Friedrichs. Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves. Pages 357:366. Vol I.New York: Inter science Publishers, inc, 1948 This shape is in contrast to subsonic airfoils, which often have rounded leading edges to reduce flow separation over a wide range of angle of attack.Zucker, Robert & Biblarz, Oscar. Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics, pages 226:229. Second Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. A rounded edge would behave as a blunt body in supersonic flight and thus would form a bow shock, which greatly increases wave drag. The airfoils' thickness, camber, and angle of attack are varied to achieve a design that will cause a slight deviation in the direction of the surrounding airflow.Bertin, John & Smith, Michael. Aerodynamics for Engineers. Third Edition. Prentice Hall. . Prentice Hall. However, since a round leading edge decreases an airfoil's susceptibility to flow separation, a sharp leading edge implies that the airfoil will be more sensitive to changes in angle of attack. Therefore, to increase lift at lower speeds, aircraft that employ supersonic airfoils also use high-lift devices such as leading edge and trailing edge flaps. Lift and drag At supersonic conditions, aircraft drag is originated due to: * Skin-friction drag due to shearing. * The wave drag due to the thickness (or volume) or zero-lift wave drag * Drag due to lift Therefore, the Drag coefficient on a supersonic airfoil is described by the following expression: CD= CD,friction\\\\+ CD,thickness\\\\+ CD,lift Experimental data allow us to reduce this expression to: CD= CD,O \\\\+ KCL2 Where CDO is the sum of C(D,friction) and C D,thickness, and k for supersonic flow is a function of the Mach number. The skin-friction component is derived from the presence of a viscous boundary layer which is infinitely close to the surface of the aircraft body. At the boundary wall, the normal component of velocity is zero; therefore an infinitesimal area exists where there is no slip. The zero-lift wave drag component can be obtained based on the supersonic area rule which tells us that the wave-drag of an aircraft in a steady supersonic flow is identical to the average of a series of equivalent bodies of revolution. The bodies of revolution are defined by the cuts through the aircraft made by the tangent to the fore Mach cone from a distant point of the aircraft at an azimuthal angle. This average is over all azimuthal angles.Woodhull, John. \\"Supersonic Aerodynamics: Lift and Drag\\". University of Colorado. Paper presented at the RTO AVT course on Fluid Dynamics Research on Supersonic Aircraft The drag due-to lift component is calculated using lift- analysis programs. The wing design and the lift-analysis programs are separate lifting-surfaces methods that solve the direct or inverse problem of design and lift analysis. Supersonic wing design Years of research and experience with the unusual conditions of supersonic flow have led to some interesting conclusions about airfoil design. Considering a rectangular wing, the pressure at a point P with coordinates (x,y) on the wing is defined only by the pressure disturbances originated at points within the upstream Mach cone emanating from point P. As result, the wing tips modify the flow within their own rearward Mach cones. The remaining area of the wing does not suffer any modification by the tips and can be analyzed with two-dimensional theory. For an arbitrary planform the supersonic leading and trailing are those portions of the wing edge where the components of the freestream velocity normal to the edge are supersonic. Similarly the subsonic leading and trailing are those portions of the wing edge where the components of the free stream velocity normal to the edge are subsonic. Delta wings have supersonic leading and trailing edges; in contrast arrow wings have a subsonic leading edge and a supersonic trailing edge. When designing a supersonic airfoil two factors that must be considered are shock and expansion waves. Whether a shock or expansion wave is generated at different locations along an airfoil depends on the local flow speed and direction along with the geometry of the airfoil. Summary Aerodynamic efficiency for supersonic aircraft increases with thin section airfoils with sharp leading and trailing edges. Swept wings where the leading edge is subsonic have the advantage of reducing the wave drag component at supersonic flight speeds; however experiments show that the theoretical benefits are not always attained due to separation of the flow over the surface of the wing; however this can be corrected with design factors. Double-Wedge and Bi-convex airfoils are the most common designs used in supersonic flights. Wave drag is the simplest and most important component of the drag in supersonic flow flight regions. For the optimized aircraft nearly 60% of its drag is skin friction drag, little over 20% is induced drag, and slightly under 20% is wave drag, hence less than 30% of the drag is due to lift.

The movie stars James Woods in the role of the actuary. Plot Temporarily unable to obtain current figures for their upcoming business report, Art Lewis and others in the insurance department of Equity Funding devise a plan to forge figures totaling the company's expected performance for that year. When the company does not perform as well as expected Art and others decide to create fake insurance policies in order to generate the necessary figures to match the expected performance, a provisional measure that is only expected to last a short time. More policies must continually be created in order to continue to the supposed growth of the company so Art enlists the aid of technician Al Green to develop computer software to randomly generate policies, the details of which must then be filled out manually. Computer and human error lead to supposed policyholders filing claims for medical conditions of the opposite sex and bills being returned because the addressees are unknown. The company manages to deceive individual auditors and the management offers Art more stock in the company and higher pay as enticement to continue the charade, knowing that he has been looking to move up in the company. Eventually the state insurance commissioners intervene and many of the key players are sent to prison.

She was an artillery training ship assigned to the Baltic Fleet by the time of the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 and was not sent to the Pacific as was most of the rest of the Baltic Fleet. She was inactive at Kronstadt during World War I, but her crew was active in the revolutionary movement. She was turned over to the Kronstadt port authority on 21 April 1921 before she was sold for scrap on 22 August 1922. She was towed to Germany during the autumn of 1922, but was not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925. Description Imperator Aleksandr II was named after the Emperor Alexander II of Russia. She was built by the New Admiralty Yard at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down in June 1885, launched in July 1887, and completed in June 1891, although her trials lasted until the spring of 1892.McLaughlin, pp. 32, 37 She was long at the waterline and long overall.

She carried of coal that provided a range of at a speed of and at a speed of .McLaughlin, pp. 32, 36‚Äì37, 43 The main armament of the Imperator Aleksandr II-class ships was a pair of Obukhov Model 1877 30-calibre guns mounted in a twin barbette mount forward. The four Obukhov Model 1877 35-calibre guns were on center-pivot mounts in casemates at the corners of the citadel, the hull being recessed to increase their arcs of fire ahead or behind. The eight Model 1877 35-calibre guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts. Four were fitted between the 9-inch guns and could traverse a total of 100¬∞. The others were mounted at each end of the ship where they could fire directly ahead or astern. The ten Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in hull embrasures of the ship between the nine and six- inch guns to defend against torpedo boats. Four Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in each fighting top. Imperator Aleksandr II carried five above- water torpedo tubes, two in the bow, one on each side of the stempost, one tube on each broadside and a tube in the stern. Smaller torpedo tubes could be mounted in four of the ship's cutters. Thirty-six mines could also be carried.McLaughlin, p. 35 History Imperator Aleksandr II served in the Baltic Fleet and along with the cruiser represented Russia at the opening of the Kiel Canal in Germany in June 1895. She ran aground in Vyborg Bay later that year, but sustained little damage. She joined the Mediterranean Squadron in August 1896. She deployed to Crete in February 1897 to operate as part of the International Squadron, a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), Imperial Russian Navy, and Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897‚Äì1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the Ottoman Empire. On 21 February 1897, she joined the British battleship and torpedo gunboats and , the Austro-Hungarian armored cruiser , and the German protected cruiser in the International Squadron's first direct offensive action, a brief bombardment of Cretan insurgent positions on the heights east of Canea (now Chania) after the insurgents refused the squadron's order to take down a Greek flag they had raised.McTiernan, p. 17.McTiernan, Mick, \\"Spyros Kayales ‚Äì A different sort of flagpole,\\" mickmctiernan.com, 20 November 2012. Imperator Aleksandr II returned to Kronstadt in September 1901. She was reboilered in December 1903 and modified in 1904 to serve as an artillery school ship. Her crew refused to suppress the mutinous garrison of Fort Konstantin defending Kronstadt in August 1906.McLaughlin, pp. 37‚Äì38 She was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in 1907. She spent most of World War I in Kronstadt where her crew was active in the revolutionary movement. She was renamed Zarya Svobody (–ó–∞—Ä—è –°–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—ã‚ÄîDawn of Freedom) in May 1917. She was turned over to the Kronstadt port authority on 21 April 1921 before she was sold for scrap on 22 August 1922. She was towed to Germany during the autumn of 1922, but was not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.McLaughlin, p. 38 Conway's says that she was reconstructed in France between 1902 and 1904, with her torpedo tubes removed and her six and nine-inch guns exchanged for five 45 calibre guns and eight six-inch 45 calibre guns.

He was an All-American fullback for the University of Minnesota from 1915‚Äì1916 and halfback for the Rock Island Independents in the first season of the National Football League in 1920. He is credited with several NFL firsts, including the first touchdown, first kickoff return for a touchdown and first passing touchdown. Biography =Early years= Wyman was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1895 and graduated from Johnson High School in St. Paul, Minnesota. =University of Minnesota= Wyman enrolled at the University of Minnesota where he played in the backfield of the legendary Golden Gophers football teams of 1915 and 1916 coached by Dr. Henry L. Williams. Wyman was tall, weighed , and was one of the best passers in the game. From 1915‚Äì1916, Wyman and Minnesota end Bert Baston were \\"one of the greatest forward-passing combinations in the history of the gridiron.\\" (\\"The passing combination. Pudge Wyman to Baston, was the most damaging offensive threat of the team that year and stories of its feats have grown to legands.\\") In Baston's biography at the College Football Hall of Fame, the 1915 and 1916 Minnesota teams were described as follows: > \\"Bert Baston was the receiver on a heralded Gopher passing partnership, > hauling down the throws of Arnold 'Pudge' Wyman. The two paced Minnesota > through the air, while Bernie Bierman carried the ground attack as Minnesota > compiled a record of 12 victories, a loss and a tie through the 1915 and > 1916 campaigns.\\" During the 1916 football season, Wyman was laid up for several days with \\"lumbago.\\" Despite the illness, Wyman was selected in 1916 as a first-team All-American fullback by Walter Eckersall of the Chicago Tribune and a second- team All-American by the United Press and University of Michigan Coach Fielding H. Yost. =World War I= In the spring of 1917, with the United States' entry into World War I, Wyman was inducted into the U.S. Army at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. Wyman received his commission as a lieutenant and was sent overseas as an artillery officer in August 1917. He was assigned to the Fifth field artillery, where he remained throughout the war. He was promoted to the rank of captain shortly before the signing of the Armistice in November 1918. After being discharged, Wyman returned to Minneapolis in May 1919. =Football coach= In the fall of 1919, Wyman served as an assistant coach of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team under head coach Henry L. Williams. =Professional football= In the 1920 NFL season, Wyman played professional football for the Rock Island Independents in the first year of the American Professional Football Association, which changed its name in 1922 to the National Football League. On October 3, 1920, the first Sunday in league history, Wyman scored three touchdowns (two on blocked punts and another on an 86-yard kickoff return) in a 45-0 victory over the Muncie Flyers. Wyman is credited with the first touchdowns on a blocked punt and the first kickoff return for a touchdown in league history. Because records are not available specifying the time of scoring in other games, the first touchdown ever in the NFL was scored either by Wyman or by Lou Partlow in a game for the Dayton Triangles. On October 10, 1920, the second week of the first NFL season, Wyman is credited with throwing the first touchdown pass in league history‚Äîa 35-yard completion to Waddy Kuehl against Hammond.

A novel is based upon her story, as her work gives a valuable insight in the life of a harem in 1920s Afghanistan. Her divorce (1927) was at the time unique in Afghanistan.  Marriage  In 1925, Aurora Nilsson was studying art in Berlin; the Golden Twenties was a vibrant period in the history of the city. There she met and married Asim Khan, the son of a former Afghan minister of government, who was studying technique at the expense of the Afghan government. The Afghan embassy acknowledged the marriage after Nilsson signed a statement that she would accept Afghan customs and, some time in the future, convert to Islam. She never did convert, however. The newly married couple travelled to Afghanistan in 1926. During the journey, Khan changed, according to Nilsson, from a modern person to a man more and more aware of the Afghan customs the closer they came to his homeland. En route he abused her twice. In Kabul, Nilsson was severely shocked about her new living conditions and was not able to adjust herself to them: she was forced to wear a veil (hijab) and was not allowed to leave the house except with her husband's permission, nor look out of the windows, or to talk when she visited a shop (purdah). She also discovered that her husband had a servant who was in fact his second wife (see Marriage in Islam). She aroused a lot of attention. Her husband was not given any position, because she had not converted. He therefore gave her permission to visit the government, the royal court, and women in different positions to try to get him a position. In her book, she describes the people, customs and events of contemporary Afghanistan. With the help of Khan's aunt, who was a lady-in-waiting to the queen, she visited the royal court in Paghman and Darullaman, and includes descriptions in her book of queen consort Soraya Tarzi, a Syrian-educated moderniser, and the mother of the king, whose name she spells as Ollja Hassrat. With their encouragement, she talked a lot about European customs.Rora Asim Khan (Aurora Nilsson): Anders Forsberg och Peter Hjukstr√∂m: Flykten fr√•n harem, Nykopia, Stockholm 1998. . She befriended the king's mother, whom she describes as influential and dominant, demonstrated dance and gymnastics for her and acted as her photographer. She failed to acquire a position for Khan, who threatened to kill or to sell her. According to Nilsson, a German woman, the widow of an afridi, Abdullah Khan, had fled to the city with her children from her late husband's successor, was sold at public auction and bought free by the German embassy for 7 000 marks. In 1927, Nilsson managed to be granted a divorce with the support of the German embassy. The divorce was unique, as it was not the custom for a woman to divorce a man. (See Divorce in Islam.) The German embassy helped her to get a room in a hotel while she waited for money from Sweden to leave the country. Her divorce created a scandal in Kabul, and she was harassed, including by the officials she visited for help. The officials denied her divorce on the grounds that she was a Muslim, claimed she needed an Afghan passport to leave the country, and offered her money to return to her former husband. As she arrives at the border, she was again stopped with an offer of money if she returned to marriage. She declined with the words: \\"No, I do not need any money! I need nothing from Afghanistan! Only my freedom!\\"  Aftermath  After her divorce, Aurora Nilsson returned to Sweden, where she published a book about her experiences (1928). In 1930, Nilsson married ice- hockey player Carl Abrahamsson. The divorce made her ex-husband \\"lose face\\" in Afghan society, and prevented him from gaining any political post. He assassinated three officials at the British embassy and in 1933 was executed. He was motivated by the desire to create conflict between the pro-British king, Mohammed Nadir Shah, and Great Britain and bring about the fall of Nadir and the reinstallement of the deposed king Amanullah Khan. His act is considered to have contributed to the deposition of king Nadir later the same year.

In addition, the rectal route bypasses around two thirds of the first-pass metabolism as the rectum's venous drainage is two thirds systemic (middle and inferior rectal vein) and one third hepatic portal system (superior rectal vein). This means the drug will reach the circulatory system with significantly less alteration and in greater concentrations.Other ROAs that bypass first-pass metabolism include inhalation (smoking, vaporizing, etc.), intravenous injection (IV), insufflation (\\"snorting\\"), et cetera, but the oral route does not bypass first-pass metabolism. Finally, rectal administration can allow patients to remain in the home setting when the oral route is compromised.

The Fleury Playbook ( ‚Äî Orl√©ans, Biblioth√®que Municipale MS. 201) is a medieval collection of Latin biblical dramas dating from around 1200 AD It was included in a composite volume of sermons, biblical texts, liturgical dramas, and hymns that was bound and kept at the library of Abbaye Saint Beno√Æt de Fleury, a Benedictine monastery at Saint-Beno√Æt-sur-Loire, France, until after the French Revolution and is now housed in the Biblioth√®que de la Ville (Municipal Library) at Orl√©ans, France. The works in the playbook are told in a musical style similar to that of plainsong. The origin of the book is unknown, but it is possible that it was written by multiple authors. The playbook consists of a total of 10 works, occupying pages 176‚Äì243 of the manuscript. Origin The playbook was compiled in the late 12th century. Although it is widely accepted that the Fleury Playbook was created in the Fleury Abbey, the neumes in the musical scores are not similar to those found there, nor was the Abbey known for any achievements in drama prior to the Fleury Playbook, both of which suggest that the book may have been bound elsewhere. However, the manuscript was copied and housed in the abbey's scriptorium, and may have served as an early example of a liturgical drama.Ogden, Dunbar H. (2002). The Staging of Drama in the Medieval Church. University of Delaware Press. p. 221. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2009-11-27. Context The plays are both liturgical and non-liturgical (specifically those pertaining to St. Nicholas), and may be performed both monastically and non-monastically, as the text does not specify. As each drama appears to correspond with different dates of the liturgical year, it is likely that main purpose of the playbook is not liturgical. The plays are meant to be performed, as evidenced by their structure, staging, and effects. Overall, the plays cover both Old Testament and New Testament themes such as the Ten Commandments and conversion. Plays The ten works in the Fleury Playbook are written in the following order: *Miracles of Saint Nicholas  Tres Filiae (The Three Daughters)  Tres Clerici (The Three Clerks)  Iconia Sancti Nicholai (The Image of Saint Nicholas) Filius Getronis, (The Son of Getron ‚Äî the most popular of those relating to Saint Nicholas) * Christmas plays  Ordo ad Representandum Herodem (The Service for Representing Herod ‚Äî about the Nativity)  Interfectio Puerorum (The Massacre of the Innocents) * Easter plays:  Visitatio Sepulcri (The Resurrection of Jesus)  Peregrinus (The Pilgrim; about the Supper at Emmaus) * Conversion and rebirth  Conversio Sancti Pauli (The Conversion of Saint Paul)  Resuscitatio Lazari (The Raising of Lazarus) References Plays based on the Bible Medieval drama 13th-century Latin books Christian plays French plays ","title":"Fleury Playbook"},{"id":"25082538","text":"Hot Panda was a Canadian indie rock band based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Carlson, ‚ÄúRabban Hormizd ‚Äî ‹™‹í‹¢ ‹ó‹ò‹™‹°‹ù‹ô‹ï ‹•‹ìÃ∞‹°‹ù‹ê ‚Äù in The Syriac Gazetteer last modified December 9, 2016, http://syriaca.org/place/168. is an important monastery of the Chaldean Catholic Church, founded about 640 AD, carved out in the mountains about 2 miles from Alqosh, Iraq, 28 miles north of Mosul. It was the official residence of the patriarchs of the Eliya line of the Assyrian Church of the East from 1551 to the 18th century, and after the union with Rome in the early 19th century, it became a prominent monastery of the Chaldean Catholic Church. The monastery is named after Rabban Hormizd (rabban is the Syriac for monk) of the Assyrian Church of the East, who founded it in the seventh century. History of the Monastery The monastery of Rabban Hormizd in 1843 Because of the fame of Rabban Hormizd, the monastery he founded became extremely important for the Church of the East. It flourished until the 10th century. Already, before the end of the 15th century, the Rabban Hormizd Monastery served as the patriarchal burial site. Yohannan Sulaqa was monk of the Rabban Hormizd Monastery before his travel to Rome to become the first Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church. Between 1551 and the 18th century, the monastery became the official residence of the patriarchs of the Eliya line of the Church of the East, which was the oldest and largest patriarchal See of the Church of the East, the only one existing patriarchal line before the Sulaqa's 1553 split. Nine patriarchal graves, from 1497 to 1804, are still located in the corridor that leads to the cell of Rabban Hormizd.. In about 1743, due to pestilence and the attacks of the Kurds, at the beginning of the Ottoman- Persian War (1743-1746). After that, the monastery was left mainly unmanned. In 1808, the Assyrian Gabriel Dambo (1775-1832) revived the abandoned monastery, rebuilt it, collected a number of pupils vowed to poverty and celibacy, and installed there a seminary. At first this initiative was opposed by Yohannan VIII Hormizd, then Archbishop of Mosul, even if it was supported by the patriarchal administrator Augustine Hindi. Patriarch Joseph Audo, before he was appointed the bishop of Mosul, was himself a monk of Rabban Hormizd monastery. Gabriel Dambo was murdered in 1832 by the soldiers of Mohammed Pasha, the Kurdish emir of Rawandouz. In 1838, the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and the town of Alqosh were attacked by the Kurds of Soran and hundreds of Assyrian Chaldeans diedDavid Wilmshurst, The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913, Peeters Publishers, 2000 and in the 1843 the Kurds started to collect as much money as they could from Christian villages, killing those who refused: more than ten thousand Christians were killed and the icons of the Rabban Hormizd monastery defaced. The library of the convent of Rabban Hormizd was rich in Syriac manuscripts. In 1828, many of these manuscripts were looted and broken up by Moussa Pasha, who had imitated the emir of Rawandouz in revolting against the Turks. In 1868, 147 volumes, manuscripts and prints, suffered the same treatment from Ismael Pasha, the successor of Moussa Pasha. The monks went on anyway to buy and copy manuscripts, thus forming an important library. Description of the Monastery in 1890 E. A. Wallis Budge, who visited Rabban Hormizd Monastery in 1890, describes the monastery with these words: > Rabban Hormizd Monastery is built half about half way up the range of > mountains which encloses the plain of Mosul on the north, and stands in a > sort of amphitheatre, which is approached by a rocky path that leads through > a narrow defile; this path has been paved by generations of monks. The > church is of stone and is of a dusky red colour ; it is built upon an > enormous rock. In the hills round about the church and buildings of the > monastery are rows of caves hewn out of the solid rock, in which the stern > ascetics of former generations lived and died. > They have neither doors nor any protection from the inclemency of the > weather, and the chill which they strike into the visitor gives an idea of > what those who lived in them must have suffered from the frosts of winter > and the drifting rain. Some of them have niches hewn in their sides or backs > in which the monks probably slept, but many lack even these means of > comfort. The cells are separate one from the other, and are approached by > narrow terraces, but some of them are perched in almost inaccessible places, > and, unless other means of entrance existed in former days, could only have > been approached by the monks crawling down from the crest of the mountain > and swinging themselves into them. > I saw no marks of fire in any of the cells. Some cells have a second small > cave hewn out behind the larger one which is entered through an opening just > large enough for a man of average size to crawl through. The monks eat meat > on Easter Day and Christmas Day only, and their usual food consists of > boiled wheat and lentils, and dark coloured, heavy bread cakes. They drink > neither wine nor spirits, and they have neither light nor fire. They drink > rain water which they preserve in rock cisterns. They are called to prayer > by the ringing of a bell at sunset, midnight, day-break, and at certain > times of the day. The number of the monks in 1820 was about fifty; in 1843 > it was thirty-nine; in 1879‚Äî80 it was sixteen, and in 1890 it was about ten. The new monastery The monastery of Rabban Hormizd was too exposed to attack to remain a functioning monastery, and was also a symbol of a turbulent time. Patriarch Joseph Audo decided to replace it, and in 1859, with financial assistance from the Vatican, built a new monastery of Notre Dame des Semences (Our Lady of the Seeds) in a safer plain site near Alqosh, about one mile from the ancient monastery. The new monastery quickly replaced Rabban Hormizd as the principal monastery of the Chaldean Church, and most of the monks moved to the new location.

Biography Princess Albertina of Orange with children He probably learned painting from his father, also a painter, but who died when he was still quite young, in 1636. That is the same year that he moved to Amsterdam, where he stayed until 1647, whereupon he moved to Leiden.RKD entry on Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel According to Houbraken he was the son of a Mennonite preacher in Leeuwarden who was a respected art teacher. His father was Lambert Jacobsz (or Jacobszoon), who had taught Govert Flinck and Jacob Adriaensz Backer in their youth, both of whom were artists from Mennonite families. Abraham took the name Tempel because when he studied in Leiden, he lived in a house there with a relief of a Tempel in the keystone. Lely biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He became a pupil of Jacob Backer, and studied mathematics at Leiden University. He met with great success with the Leiden city council, earning several generous commissions, including a series of three large allegorical paintings on the cloth industry of Leiden for the Cloth Hall which still hang in their original place today in the Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal. He became master of the Guild of St. Luke in 1657 and in 1659 he was chartermaster. In 1660 he returned to Amsterdam.

Delineation  As part of the Simla Agreement signed on 2 July 1972, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto agreed that \\"the line of control resulting from the ceasefire of December 17, 1971, shall be respected by both sides without prejudice to the recognised position of either side\\". In November‚ÄìDecember 1972, the military delegations of the two sides met in Suchetgarh to delineate the Line of Control. After delineation, signed maps were exchanged by the two sides and submitted to the respective governments for ratification. Scholar Brian Cloughley remarked that the delineation represented remarkable territorial precision. However, it terminated at the grid reference NJ9842, leaving undelimited roughly 100 miles east to the border with China. The 1972 delineation however followed the same practice as in the Karachi Agreement of 1949, which delineated the cease-fire line of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948. It too stopped at a point called Khor, and declared that the lines goes \\"thence north to glaciers\\".  Location  1954 US Army map of the area; The grid 38 90000, 13 40000 is the fifth square in the bottom row. The point NJ9842 is on the Saltoro Range, at the top of the Chalunka Lungpa valley that goes up from the village of Chalunka. The immediate south of the point is occupied by the Korisa Glacier, the source of the Chalunka Lungpa stream which flows into the Shyok River. To the southeast of NJ9842 is the Waris Glacier, which forms the source of the Waris Lungpa stream. To the north of the point are the Chulung Glacier, which is the source of the Dansam River (one of the feeder rivers of the Saltoro River), and the Gyong Glacier, which generates a tributary stream called Gyong, all in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The prevailing line of control, called the Actual Ground Position Line, runs east from NJ9842 for about 5 km, along the water-parting line of the two sets of glaciers. Afterwards, it runs north along the watershed line of the Saltoro ridge, which divides the waters of the tributaries of the Shyok River that flow into Pakistan-administered Kashmir from those that flow into the Nubra river and tributaries in Indian- administered Kashmir. Even though several authors identify the point Khor of the 1949 cease-fire line with NJ9842,See, for example, the two points are quite different. Khor is further south, in the grid 39 00000, 13 20000 of Indian grid coordinates, closer to the Shyok River valley. The move up from Khor to NJ9842 in 1972 represented the territory gained by India in the Indo- Pakistani War of 1971.

It was named in honor of Brigadier General William S. Harney. Fort Harney was used as a supply depot and administrative headquarters from 1867 to 1880 during the Army's campaign against Northern Paiute bands in Eastern Oregon and the Bannock uprising in the same area. Today, nothing remains of Fort Harney except a small cemetery.  Camp Harney  In 1864, the Army had begun using a site along Rattlesnake Creek, in what is now Harney County, Oregon, for temporary supply drops. The site was unofficially known as Rattlesnake Camp. As civilian wagon trains passing through eastern Oregon increased and the number of miners in the area grew, the demand for protection from Native American raiding parties required the Army to establish a number of permanent outposts in eastern Oregon. Rattlesnake Creek was located near the center of eastern Oregon, making it an ideal place for a military supply depot and administrative headquarters. The Army established a permanent outpost near the mouth of Rattlesnake Creek on 16 August 1867.Friedel, Megan K., \\"Oregonscape\\", Oregon Historical Quarterly (Vol 110, No. 1), Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, Spring 2009, p. 160.Michno, Gregory The Deadliest Indian War The Snake Conflict, 1864-1868, Caxton Press, Caldwell, Idaho, 2007, p. 228.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

However, Major General Henry W. Halleck, commander of the Military Department of the Pacific at the time, disapproved the Camp Steele name and suggested the camp be named in honor of Brigadier General William S. Harney who commanded the Army's Department of Oregon in 1858 and 1859. Based on General Halleck's recommendation, the post was officially designated Camp Harney on 14 September 1867.

Military campaigns  In 1867 and 1868, General George Crook led companies from the 1st Cavalry Regiment and 8th Cavalry Regiment, mounted infantry from the 9th Infantry Regiment and 23rd Infantry Regiment, and Indian scouts from the Wasco and Warm Springs tribes in a successful campaign against Northern Paiute bands in eastern Oregon and northern California. This was part of the conflict known as the Snake War. Camp Harney was one of the outposts used to resupply Crook's troops during the campaign.Hart, Herbert M., Tour Guide to Old Western Forts, Pruitt Publishing Company, Boulder, Colorado, 1980, pp. 137‚Äì138.\\"The Snake War, 1864-1868\\" (PDF), Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series (Number 236), Idaho State Historical Society, Boise, Idaho, 1966.Bourke, John G.

In 1872, the local Paiute bands were settled on a reservation north of Malheur Lake in eastern Oregon. Camp Harney was within the reservation boundary. The camp housed Army troops assigned to guard the reservation from white trespassers and to keep the Paiutes from leaving. Despite the Army's presence, white settlers used reservation lands for grazing. That unchecked encroachment helped ignite the Bannock War in 1878.Walker, F.

During the Bannock War, Camp Harney once again served as an important Army supply depot and military headquarters. The camp was in the center of the conflict area and several newspapers reported that Camp Harney was in imminent danger of being overrun by Native American warriors.\\"An Indian Massacre Feared; Probability that Camp Harney will be Captured by Hostiles--Rumor that Buffalo Horn Has been Killed\\", The New York Times, New York, New York, 19 June 1878.\\"American\\", Deseret News, Salt Lake City, Utah, 26 June 1878, p. 884.

By January 1879, there were 543 Bannock and Paiute prisoners being held at Camp Harney. After the war, the prisoners were resettled on the Yakama Indian Reservation in the Washington Territory, north of the Malheur reservation. The Army officially changed the name of the post to Fort Harney on 5 April 1879. However, without a reservation to guard, there was no reason to maintain the post. As a result, Fort Harney was abandoned on 13 June 1880. On 13 September 1982, the Malheur reservation lands were officially returned to the public domain except for the Fort Harney site which was retained by the Army. The Army returned the parcel to the public domain on 2 March 1889. After the fort was abandoned, local settlers dismantled the buildings, using much of the materiel to build up the nearby town of Harney City. Today, nothing remains of Fort Harney except a small cemetery.  Fort infrastructure  In 1867, Camp Harney was busy and growing rapidly.Gilliss, Julia (compiled and transcribed by Charles J.

It was located in the high desert country of eastern Oregon at an elevation of above sea level. The fort structures were built on a flat west of Rattlesnake Creek between steep ridges that flanked the stream. North of the site there were stands of pine that supplied the camp's sawmill with timber.United States Geological Survey topographic map, Harney ACME mapper, www.acme.com, 29 March 2009. By 1877, Camp Harney was a well-developed frontier outpost. It had a large parade ground oriented north and south with a headquarters building and guardhouses. There was a home for the commanding officer plus five additional officers' quarters, two were log structures and three were frame buildings. There were three log barracks building for enlisted troops plus four log houses for enlisted men with families. To feed the men, the camp had mess halls, kitchens, a bakery, and a slaughter house to provide fresh meat. There were quartermaster's storehouses, a military commissary, a hospital, and a sawmill. The post also had a blacksmith shop and stables for 150 horses. In addition to the Army troops, the post had four civilian clerks, two masons, one saddlemaker, a shoemaker, a painter, a baker, and four laundry maids.Hart, Herbert M., Tour Guide to Old Western Forts, Pruitt Publishing Company, Boulder, Colorado, 1980, p. 134.

The newspaper serves the Russian-speaking community of the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area. Gorizont was established in 1995 by Anatoli Muchnik. In 1996 Muchnik appointed Leonid Reznikov, a recently emigrated Russian scientist, as executive editor. Need for a Russian-language newspaper in Colorado Gorizont began with reporting local cultural and business events and advertising for the fast-growing Russian community in Colorado. Starting in the mid-1990s Gorizont became the community's main source of news from Russia in addition to its local coverage. This was due in part to the language barrier for the members of the community who spoke only Russian and relied upon Gorizont for translations of American current events and news. In addition articles in Gorizont introduced readers to the American lifestyle while preserving a link to Russian culture. Further development In the 1990s, Internet access was still very limited, and few forums or discussion boards were available. Gorizont was the community instrument for communication, exchange of opinions and addressing issues of interest to the Russian-speaking community. Gorizont did not disappear like other local Russian publications after satellite TV and the Internet became widely available to the Russian-speaking community. For many years it has covered stories of Russians living in Colorado, reporting their business and career achievements, interviewed artists, actors, teachers, and scientists who have been prominent in the Russian community of Colorado. Gorizont has published over 70 articles on Russian veterans of the Second World War who moved to the United States and still reside in Colorado. Gorizont is listed as organizer and supporter of many activities. It was sponsoring and supporting a number of annual festivals, including First and Second Annual Colorado European Festivals, First Russian Festival, beauty contests, education programs, including Limmud Colorado, concerts, art shows and other events significant for community and the state. Gorizont supported connections between Russian and American communities. English-speaking reporters from major American publications were referring Gorizont in articles related to the Russian community of Colorado. Gorizont was a means to publish important messages from official organizations both Russian and American. Gorizont is in the list of publications distributed by Newspaperdirect, one of the largest Press Display agencies. Publication type Gorizont is a newsprint, full color and black and white tabloid style weekly newspaper published on Fridays. It targets the Russian Community of Colorado, including South East Denver, Glendale, Aurora, Arvada, Thornton, Boulder, Colorado Springs, and Breckenridge.

The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliter per hectare of red wine and 45 hectoliter per hectare for white wine. The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 per cent potential alcohol for village-level red wine, 11.0 per cent for village-level white wine and Premier Cru red wine, and 11.5 per cent for Premier Cru white wine. Premiers Crus There are 20 climats in Saint-Aubin classified as Premier Cru vineyards. One group of vineyards in the eastern part of the commune is contiguous with Premier Cru vineyards of Chassagne-Montrachet, and continue up a south-facing slope situated a little to the west of the Montrachet vineyard. Another group is situated on an east-facing slope in the side valley, forming a band immediately above the village of Saint-Aubin itself. The village of Gamay is situated between these two groups of vineyards. The wines of these vineyards are designated Saint-Aubin Premier Cru + vineyard name, or may labelled just Saint-Aubin Premier Cru, in which case it is possible to blend wine from several Premier Cru vineyards within the AOC. In 2007, of the total Saint- Aubin vineyard surface consisted of Premier Cru vineyards, of which white and red Saint-Aubin Premier Cru. The annual production of Premier Cru wine, as a five-year average, is 4,239 hectoliter of white wine and 1,489 hectoliter of red wine.

The brothers inherited the ironworks from their father in 1754, with Curtis (the oldest) receiving a two-thirds interest and Peter one-third. The brothers took over operation of the ironworks about 1765 and expanded it successfully. Curtis operated the Cornwall Furnace that produced pig iron, and Peter, who had more ironmaking experience, ran the nearby Hopewell Forges on Hammer Creek that produced more valuable bar iron. In 1773, Curtis paid taxes on at the furnace location and Peter paid taxes on at the forges location, reflecting both the size of the operation and their proportional ownership. They operated the business through and after the Revolution, becoming quite prosperous until they died, Peter in 1786 and Curtis in 1789. Most of the Cornwall ironworks fell out of family hands during the period 1783 - 1802, to Robert Coleman who became Pennsylvania's first millionaire. But a portion, including rights to access the ore, remained with Peter Jr.'s heirs, who added to it to become major Pennsylvania producers of iron in the mid-19th century, operating out of Mount Hope Estate. Patriotism Curtis Grubb was an outspoken radical and an early supporter of the Revolution. The brothers were major contributors to the Revolutionary War effort, their ironworks supplied cannon, ammunition, shot and saltpans (used to make salt from seawater) to the Colonial forces. George Washington personally visited Cornwall to inspect the facility. Both brothers were elected as militia colonels, Curtis' unit was the 2nd Lancaster Battalion, Peter Jr.'s the 8th Lancaster Battalion, both assigned to the Flying Camp. Curtis was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1775, 1777, 1778 and 1782. An interesting anecdote provides a bit of insight into the times. One of Curtis' roles during the war was to oversee 340 Hessian prisoners of war who had been brought to Cornwall in August 1777 to help alleviate the severe war-induced shortage of labor. The Hessians were housed in a local Moravian Congregation's meeting house, over the objections of the pastor. Unfortunately, they behaved poorly and caused serious problems, including damage to church property. Later, the pastor told Curtis that \\"they made themselves outrageously drunk, and then the women began to fight; after them the men, who took sides with the women; finally the fight became general.\\" The life of a Colonel was not all about fighting the British! Business career Peter and his brother took over the operation of the ironworks about 1765, with Peter operating the Hopewell Forges and Curtis the Cornwall Furnace. They were successful operators of the ironworks through the Revolution. They were, however, complex individuals whose affairs were closely intertwined and became increasingly acrimonious. Their ongoing feuds and legal entanglements led to the fragmentation of the ironwork's ownership and its eventual loss by the Grubb family into the hands of Robert Coleman, who used it to build his fortune. Tensions between the brothers reached the crisis point in 1783 when Curtis decided to marry his 20-year-old cousin Ann Grubb, granddaughter of the brothers' uncle Nathaniel Grubb. Curtis' oldest son, Peter III, became concerned for his inheritance and demanded a resolution. Curtis conveyed to his son an interest in the ironworks, which unfortunately required a legal subdivision of the assets that had previously been shared informally. Included in Peter III's new assets was a one-third interest in the Hopewell Forges on Hammer Creek. Peter, who had been running the forges, became fearful and reacted by purchasing land at a place he called Mount Hope to build his own furnace in competition with his brother, going heavily into debt. The feud intensified and Peter III became concerned for the business and sold his interest to Robert Coleman, a friend who had worked for the brothers and was by then also an ironmaster. Curtis reacted to the competition from his brother and allied himself with Coleman, trying various tactics to put his brother out of business. Succumbing to the pressure, Peter became distraught and committed suicide in 1786. The ironworks were apportioned by the courts among Curtis, Peter's estate, and Coleman. Coleman also later acquired the Hopewell Forges from Peter's heirs. Upon Curtis' death in 1789, his estate passed to his heirs, primarily to his son Curtis Jr. But he was only 17 and in poor health; he died in 1790, leaving his inheritance to other family members, none of whom could operate the ironworks. Coleman managed the ironworks for the family until 1798, when they agreed to sell to him. With his previous acquisitions Robert Coleman became the owner of most of the former Grubb holdings, which he added to his own and expanded to become Pennsylvania's first millionaire. The holdings remaining in Peter Jr.'s estate were eventually expanded upon by his second son Henry Bates Grubb, whose family went on to become one of Pennsylvania's largest iron producers in the mid-19th century, with their center of operations at Mount Hope Estate. Personal life Curtis was the more gregarious of the brothers and led a sometimes unconventional life. He married Ann Few in 1754 and in 1757 they had a son, Peter Grubb III. But marriage didn't agree with Curtis and he left for Europe soon thereafter, abandoning his family. Such a tactic was not uncommon in colonial America, where divorce was virtually impossible. Ann, believing Curtis to be dead, remarried to Archibald McNeal in 1763 and had a child. But Curtis did return and eventually wanted to rectify the situation and requested the Provincial Assembly to dissolve the marriage and allow him to remarry. No one had ever been granted a divorce allowing for remarriage; but Curtis pressed his case and by a special act of the Assembly in 1769, he was granted a divorce. All acts passed by colonial legislatures had to be reviewed by the British Board of Trade, and it was thought that the unprecedented nature of this act might have impinged upon the powers reserved to Parliament. Curtis' divorce was allowed to become final, but in 1772 the Governors of the Colonies were directed not to accept any further acts of divorce passed by colonial legislatures. This was an example of the kinds of British actions experienced by the colonists that led to their desire for independence. After the divorce Curtis married Elizabeth Carpenter and they had two children, Curtis Jr. in 1772 and Elizabeth about 1775. Elizabeth Carpenter appears to have died sometime after their daughter was born, as she disappeared from the historical records. In 1783 Curtis decided to marry his 20 year old cousin Ann Grubb, which of course led to the family crisis described above. Curtis and Ann had three children, Samuel, Martha and Julianna, before Curtis died in 1789 at the age of 59. Curtis was buried at the Tabor Reformed Church cemetery, later removed to the Old Hebron cemetery in Lebanon. History revised The six children, from Ann Few, Elizabeth Carpenter and Ann Grubb, comprised Curtis' acknowledged family. But Curtis' personal life from 1775 to 1783 is not well documented and Curtis would have had two infant children needing motherly attention. Fortunately for historians, Curtis Jr., who was the principal heir to his father's estate, died as a teenager and left a will leaving his recently inherited estate to family members, primarily to his sister Elizabeth. Close examination of that will, probably written by the family, sheds light on that eight-year period. Curtis Jr.'s will left most of his estate to his sister Elizabeth (who soon sold it to Robert Coleman), but surprisingly also left small bequests to a Jehu Grubb \\"for his education\\" and an \\"Aunt Ann\\" Grubb. \\"Aunt Ann\\" appears to have been Hannah Bellarby Grubb, another cousin who was the adopted daughter of Curtis' uncle Samuel Grubb. Hannah had come to help Peter Jr. as his housekeeper in 1774 after his wife died in childbirth, and they had a daughter, Hannah Elizabeth, later that same year. Peter Jr. didn't want to marry again and it appears Hannah moved to Curtis' household to care for his infant children, along with her own. She probably remained in Curtis' household until he decided to marry Ann, at which time she and their son Jehu would have been forced to move out. Perhaps the family, who wrote the will, felt they were owed something, or perhaps they wanted to avoid any potential claims to the estate. The theory is strongly supported by the fact that Hannah, not his third wife Ann, was buried near Curtis at Tabor Reformed Church. Her headstone at Old Hebron cemetery in Lebanon, to which the graves were moved, proclaims her as Curtis Grubb's wife. Of Curtis' acknowledged children only Peter III had children. But Jehu went on to a notable life in Stark County, Ohio, and had a large family. Ironically, Curtis Grubb's only documented descendants still carrying the Grubb surname are through Jehu.

It includes actions carried out by the Red Hand Commando (RHC), a group integrated into the UVF shortly after their formation in 1972. It also includes attacks claimed by the Protestant Action Force (PAF), a covername used by the UVF. Most of these actions took place during the conflict known as \\"the Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland. The UVF's declared goal was to destroy Irish republican paramilitary groups. However, most of its victims were Irish Catholic civilians, who were often chosen at random. Whenever it claimed responsibility for its attacks, the UVF usually claimed that those targeted were Provisional Irish Republican Army members or IRA sympathizers.Kentucky New Era, 14 April 1992 At other times, attacks on Catholic civilians were claimed as \\"retaliation\\" for IRA actions, since the IRA drew most of its support from majority-Catholic areas. Such retaliation was seen as both collective punishment and an attempt to weaken the IRA's support. Many retaliatory assaults on Catholics were claimed using the PAF covername. Members of the RUC, the UDR and the British army colluded with the UVF in a number of incidents. 1960s =1966= *6 April 1966: UVF members petrol bombed a Catholic primary school‚ÄîHoly Cross Girls' School‚Äîin Belfast.

The loyalists hoped the attacks would be blamed on the dormant IRA and on elements of the civil rights movement, which was demanding an end to discrimination against Catholics. The loyalists intended to bring down Ulster Unionist Party Prime Minister Terence O'Neill, who had promised some concessions to the civil rights movement. At the time, the bombings were indeed blamed on the IRA, and British soldiers were deployed to guard installations. On 30 March, loyalists bombed an electricity substation just outside Belfast, causing blackouts across much of the city's south and east. On 4 April, they bombed a water pipeline at Dunadry. On 20 April, they bombed Silent Valley Reservoir and an electricity pylon in Kilmore. On 24 April, they again bombed the water pipeline at Dunadry.

Chancery hand is a term for various types of handwriting associated with chanceries. Etymology The word chancery is from French, from Latin, and ultimately refers to the lattice-work partition that divided a section of a church or court, from which also derives chancel, cancel \\"cross out with lines\\", and, more distantly, incarcerate \\"put behind bars\\" ‚Äì see chancery for details. In England In England, this office was one of the two main administrative offices, along with the Exchequer. It began as part of the royal household, but by the 13th-century was separate from the household and was located at Westminster. It produced all the charters and writs, which were all sealed with the Great Seal. The office was headed by the Chancellor of England, and was staffed by royal clerks. It came into existence shortly before the Norman Conquest of England, and was retained by King William I of England after the Conquest. In 1199, the chancery began to keep the Charter Rolls, a record of all the charters issued by the office. Then in 1201, the Patent Rolls, a similar record of letters patent began, and in 1204 the Close Rolls, or record of letters close began.Saul \\"Government\\" Companion to Medieval England pp. 115‚Äì118 Although the English Chancery was responsible for most of the charters and writs issued by the government, they were not responsible for all of them, as the Exchequer and the justiciars continued to issue writs during the Angevin period.Mason \\"Administration and Government\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 139 Whether there was a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England prior to the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians. Some hold that most royal charters in Anglo-Saxon England were produced by the beneficiaries of the charter. Other historians hold that by the 10th and 11th centuries most royal charters were produced by royal clerks, and thus they probably were produced in some sort of chancery- like office.Rankin \\"Chancery, Royal\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England In the crusader states The crusader states in the Levant also had chanceries. In the Principality of Antioch, the office was responsible for producing all documents pertaining to the administration of the principality. One office holder in the Antiochene chancery was Walter the Chancellor, who wrote the only early history of the state.Bennett \\"Normans in the Mediterranean\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 95 In the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the chancery produced hundreds of documents. The chancellor of Jerusalem was one of the highest posts in the kingdom. One famous chancellor was the chronicler William of Tyre. In Normandy In the Duchy of Normandy, after 1066 a ducal chancery developed, especially under William's sons Robert Curthose and Henry I.Mason \\"Administration and Government\\" Companion to the Anglo-Norman World p. 159 In France The French royal chancery first appears in a rudimentary form during the Merovingian dynasty. They borrowed from the diplomatic institutions of the late Roman Empire, and had four officials, usually clerics, called \\"referendaries\\" who guarded the king's seal. The documents are very formulaic, probably using the formulary of Marculf as a source. They used their own script, which was very messy with many ligatures, and their Latin was of very poor quality.Tessier Diplomatique royale fran√ßaise pp. 1‚Äì20 After the Merovingians were overthrown by the Mayors of the Palace, the chancery began to develop more fully. The Carolingian chancellor was usually the Archbishop of Reims. He was a member of the king's council, while the actual business of the chancery was conducted by lesser officials. Louis the Pious created a new formulary, the Formulae Imperiales, which was the basis of formularies used in later centuries. They also used a different script, the more legible Carolingian minuscule. The Carolingian chancery took requests from those who wished to have a charter drawn up, and the king would send missi to investigate the situation.Tessier Diplomatique royale fran√ßaise pp. 50‚Äì110 In the Capetian period, the chancellor was still the Archbishop of Reims. The chancery itself tended not to write its own charters, but rather confirmed charters that had already been written by the intended recipient. This reflected the relative powerlessness of the Capetian kings, who, unlike their Carolingian predecessors, controlled only the Ile-de- France. It was not until the 12th century that the chancellor truly became the head of the chancery, rather than the guardian of the king's seal. This chancellor was a member of the Great Officers of the Crown of France, which developed in the 11th and 12th centuries. Because the chancellor had power over the granting of charters and other benefits, the kings often saw them as a threat to their own authority, and the office sometimes lay dormant for many years. Philip II abolished the post in 1185, and the chancery remained without an official head for most of the thirteenth and part of the fourteenth century. The head of the chancery in this period took over the guardianship of the seal, and was usually not a cleric. Documents in this period were signed as \\"cancellaria vacante\\" (\\"with the chancellorship vacant\\"). When the chancellorship was restored in the fourteenth century, it was held by laymen and became the highest ranking of the Great Officers.Tessier Diplomatique royale fran√ßaise pp. 127‚Äì141 In the fourteenth century the rest of the chancery staff consisted of notaries and secretaries. They were appointed by the chancellor and wrote royal letters and other documents that were not already produced by the beneficiaries. The most important official after the chancellor was the audencier, who presided over the ceremony in which the chancellor affixed the royal seal to a document. The chancery charged a tax to recipients of charters; Jews were taxed at a higher rate, but royal grants of alms or other donations were not usually taxed. The Capetian chancery also used a minuscule script, and documents were written in Latin until the thirteenth century, when French also began to be used.Tessier Diplomatique royale fran√ßaise pp. 152‚Äì215 The majority of the documents produced by the chancery were letters patent, which were directed from the king to a single person. They could be letters of thanks, financial transactions, letters of justice and pardon, legitimization of children, recognition of nobility, and many other subjects. Charters authorizing grants of land or settling property disputes are less common. Documents were not registered in an archive until the fourteenth century, and then only rarely, if the document pertained to royal administration.Tessier Diplomatique royale fran√ßaise pp. 256‚Äì290 Normally a document was validated by witnesses, including the author, the chancellor, or other nobles; the early Capetians derived their authority from the number of people they could collect to sign a document. Later in the Middle Ages the kingship had regained enough power that the king's seal was considered authoritative enough on its own.Guyotjeannin], Pycke and Tock L'Atelier du M√©di√©viste 2: Diplomatique M√©di√©vale pp. 86‚Äì92 In Scotland The chancery office was abolished in 1928. Under the papacy The medieval popes had a Chancery of Apostolic Briefs, which was one of the four great papal offices, the others being the Apostolic Camera, which handled finances, the Penitentiary, which dealt with spiritual matters, and the Sacra Rota, which dealt with judicial matters.Zacour Introduction to Medieval Institutions p. 194 See also *Chancery (disambiguation), for other meanings *Chancellery, the offices of various chancellors *Chancellor (China) Citations References   Medieval law Medieval occupations Writing Diplomatics ","title":"Chancery (medieval office)"},{"id":"25083056","text":"A bottle of white Auxey-Duresses from the producer Domaine Herni Latour.

He is the father of actor Trevor Snarr. Dan Snarr with long mustache Snarr said he decided to seek public office because he wanted to continue the work of former Mayor Lynn Pett. During Snarr‚Äôs tenure in office, Murray saw the cleanup of the smelter site that is now the home of the Intermountain Medical Center; the property cleanup to establish the Willow Pond Park; and the revitalization of the city's gateway at 5300 South Street and State Street. (The area used to bring in less than $200,000 in sales-tax revenue; now it generates some $2 million.). Murray also became involved in the Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (UTOPIA) community FTTH program. Snarr has much well known personal flair, such as driving a Harley Davidson motorcycle while wearing leather garb. Perhaps his most famous trademark is his handlebar mustache which reached a total length of one-foot. His mustache received national attention when Murray hosted a hometown segment of the show American Idol. Snarr was seen onstage with contestant David Archuleta, and generated banter from host Ryan Seacrest concerning the mustache‚Äôs length. This national recognition caused the mayor to receive mention from the American Mustache Institute and Esquire magazine. By April 2012, however, he had grown a variation on the mustache, featuring long muttonchop-style whiskers that are waxed at the end. In 2013, he was one of nine mayors who established July 15 as Social Media Giving Day, encouraging citizens to support charities via social media.http://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social- media-marketing/hey-put-your-twitter-where-your-mouth-is/ After completing his time as Murray City Mayor, Snarr was the Democratic Party nominee for a seat on the Salt Lake County Council. He was defeated in November 2014 by Republican incumbent Aimee Winder Newton 55% to 45%.https://scf10.slco.org/clerk/elections/results/public/  Shave off mustache for charity  In May 2009, Snarr entered in a shave-or save battle. He set to shave his nearly foot-long handlebar mustache for charity, supporting the Children's Miracle Network. Snarr, who has sported the waxed mustache for three years, put the decision to a vote of Murray residents, and says: \\"People are voting 'shave.' It's a way to get back at an elected official.\\" A local Costco warehouse store says residents have been voting since May 1. The paper ballots will be counted May 16. But when the American Mustache Institute took notice of his plans, called on Snarr to \\"keep a stiff upper lip in the face of opposition.\\" The American Mustache Institute demanded Snarr \\"recant\\" his shaving pledge and find another way to support the Children's Miracle Network. \\"This could include shaving your head, your back or committing to not clipping your toenails for up to eight months,\\" the group's leaders wrote to the mayor. Aaron Perlut, chairman of the American Mustache Institute, said that Snarr \\"should face down his opposition‚Äîmainly women‚Äîand keep his mustache.\\" Snarr said he had never heard of the American Mustache Institute and isn't certain how to respond to the letter. \\"It's like politics‚Äîwhatever you do, you're damned,\\" he said. However, the appeals American Mustache Institute were in vain. With a vote of 966 to 1,254, more people voted for shaving the mustache than to save it. Residents had to pay $1 for each vote, and some contributed extra. That means Snarr raised at least $2,220 for the Children's Miracle Network. Snarr's wife, April, did the honors, leaving him with a short mustache after a clipping ceremony at a local Costco, on May 16. Following the events, the American Mustache Institute posted a tongue-in-cheek eulogy for the mayor's mustache on its website.

It is an important Marian place of pilgrimage. The pilgrimage comes from a legend that describes a miracle made by the Virgin Mary.http://www.czechtourism.com/c/holy-hostyn Legend According to a traditional legend, first recorded in 1665 by the writer Bohuslav Balb√≠n in his work Diva Montis Sancti, during the disastrous raid of the \\"Tartars\\" in the 13th century, people who were seeking asylum here lacked water and they prayed Mary for help. It is said that a stream of water came out of the ground and a powerful storm forced Tatars to retreat. History Basilica of the protective Virgin of Mercy On the hilltop is an ancient hill fort with a ditch and defensive wall made of earth and stone, which is 4‚Äì8 metres high. The fortification was first built by the people of the Lusatian culture circa 1200 BCE. In later centuries it was destroyed and rebuilt several times, including by the Celts. The first medieval chapel of Virgin Mary was probably built by the miners and was first mentioned in 1544 without any reference to the legend, which probably originated from the existence of massive walls, chapel and spring near the hilltop. At the time when the legend was first mentioned by Bohuslav Balb√≠n (1665), it was a clear analogy to the contemporary war with the Turks. After another successful war against Turks there were an increasing number of pilgrims visiting Host√Ωn, so a new basilica was built in 1721‚Äì1748 together with Via Crucis, the pilgrims' hospice and other facilities. Another chapel was built next to the spring of \\"holy water\\", which was believed by locals to possess a healing effect. This led to the nickname \\"Moravian Lourdes\\" for Host√Ωn. A 240-step stairway from the spring to the basilica was constructed in 1909. In 1903 new open-air Stations of the Cross were built by the architect Du≈°an Jurkoviƒç, and are now a major tourist attraction for the region, together with the basilica itself, attracting not only Catholic pilgrims but thousands of other tourists. The largest crowds at the site were in August 1912, when the main statue of Virgin Mary was crowned by the golden crown blessed in Rome by Pius X. The number of pilgrims and other visitors was estimated to be 200,000 within ten days.  Geology  The entire massif consists of so-called Host√Ωn geological formation.

At the 2001 World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary, Hordge won a silver medal in 100 meters, finishing behind only Darrel Brown (10.31 to 10.41). In his junior season at Forest Brook High School in Houston, Texas, Hordge narrowly missed winning the Texas 4A 100-meter title to Brendan Christian 10.15 to 10.16. The following month, he won the 100 meters over Kelly Willie and Jonathan Wade in the Great Southwest Classic in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with a 10.21 clocking (+2.0 m/s wind). Horde still holds the 17-18 USATF Gulf Association record the 100 meters at 10.11 from that era.http://media.hometeamsonline.com/photos/htosports/USATFGULF/2013_Championship_Records.pdf Hordge participated in the 2002 World Junior Championships in Kingston, Jamaica, and finished with a bronze medal in 100 meters, placing third behind Darrel Brown and Marc Burns. Known for his slow start out of the blocks, officials at the meet were in amazement at how he closed at the finish. A few days later at the same meet, he anchored the United States 4x100 relay squad to Gold. Hordge received the baton identical to Usain Bolt of Jamaica, and then pulled away from him down the stretch, as he and teammates Ashton Collins, Wes Felix, and Ivory Williams set a new world junior record of 38.92. It was the fourth and fastest of five different 4x100 relays he anchored under 40 seconds in the space of three weeks.http://archive.dyestat.com/3us/aoy/hordge-willie.htm Just like he is today, Usain Bolt was the talk of the meet back then, and Hordge showed him up on his own soil in Kingston.

He is mostly known for having translated the New Testament into Albanian for the first time in the Gheg Albanian dialect in 1872. He also provided a translation in Tosk Albanian in 1879 thereby improving the 1823 tosk version of Vangjel Meksi. By providing translation in both dialects, he has the merit of founding the basis of the unification of both dialects into a national language.Albanian literature in Greek script Life Kostandin Kristoforidhi's New Testament in the Gheg dialect He was born in Elbasan and from 1847 studied at the Zosimea Greek college in Yanya (modern Ioannina), where he became friends with Johann Georg von Hahn by helping him learn Albanian and write a German-Albanian dictionary. In 1856 or 1857 he joined a Protestant church in Izmir after his conversion to Protestantism, thus becoming the first known Albanian Protestant. He went to Istanbul in 1857, and drafted a Memorandum for the Albanian language. He stayed in Malta until 1860 in a Protestant seminary, finishing the translation of The New Testament in the Tosk and Gheg dialects. He was helped by Nikolla Serreqi from Shkod√´r with the Gheg version of the Testament. Nikolla Serreqi was also the proponent for the use of the Latin alphabet, which had already been used by the early writers of the Albanian literature and Kristoforidhi embraced the idea of a Latin alphabet.Lloshi pp.14‚Äì15 He went to Tunis, where he worked as a teacher until 1865, when a representative of the British and Foreign Bible Society contracted him to work for the company to produce Bible translations into Albanian. He published in 1866 the first Gheg translation of the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles; for the many years to come, he continued his work, publishing in the Tosk and Gheg dialects The Psalms (1868, 1869); The New Testament (1879, 1869), Genesis and Exodus (Tosk, 1880); Deuteronomy (Tosk, 1882); The Proverbs and the Book of Isaiah (Tosk, 1884). Kristoforidhi became a member of the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights (founded 1877) which was a group of Albanian intelligentsia based in Istanbul advocating for the territorial integrity and unity of Albanian inhabited areas in the Ottoman Empire. During the Great Eastern Crisis, Kristoforidhi criticized some League of Prizren notables and viewed their actions as being based on self interest, preservation of the sultan's power and \\"Muslim dominance\\" instead of the national interest. He viewed the development of the Albanian language as important for the preservation of the Albanian people and devoted much of his lifetime toward studying and recording the language by traveling throughout Albania to collect material. The result of those endeavours was his most important work, The Dictionary of the Albanian Language () ‚Äì (), was published in Athens, Greece, in 1904, 25 years after it had been drafted by Kristoforidhi and after his death. It was written in Greek.Lloshi p. 9. He knew Albanian (Tosk and Gheg dialects), Greek, Latin, Hebrew, English, Italian, Turkish, Bulgarian, Arabic, French and German.

King Chimera first appeared in Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #24 (April 2009), and was created by Matthew Sturges and Fernando Pasarin. King has kept a mysterious identity since his debut, as very little is known about his past, so much that his real name has not been revealed. The only things that have currently been revealed about King is that is he Turkish, he claims to be the son of \\"King\\" Standish, and his former lover, Namita, his mother and others he knew are deceased. Publication history King Chimera's first, very brief, appearance was in Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #24 in early 2009, created by Matthew Sturges and Fernando Pasarin. He did not appear again until issue #29, when he became a major character to the series. He was only in four more issues before switching to the JSA All-Stars series. During this switch, he made a very brief appearance in the Justice Society of America 80-Page Giant #1. He then became a regular character in the JSA All-Stars series, appearing in every issue released. Early in the JSA All-Stars run, Justice Society of America Annual #2 was released and King was featured in it. Towards the end of 2010, he also appeared in the nineteenth issue of the second volume of Power Girl. King last appeared in the eighteenth issue of JSA All-Stars, the final issue of the series. =Creation and concept= Newsarama held an interview with Matthew Sturges, the writer of JSA All-Stars, to discuss the series. Sturges briefly talked about King Chimera and how he wanted to re-invent him off of \\"King\\" Standish. Regarding Standish, Sturges said: \\"You only saw him in disguise. And so, with this new King Chimera, it's a bit more metaphorical than that. I'll just leave it at that\\".Justice Society x2: Writer Matt Sturges Talks JSA ALL-STARS By Vaneta Rogers. Posted: 28 July 2009 11:49 am ET In another interview with Newsarama, Sturges said: \\"King Chimera is a new character that kind of exemplifies the attitude, although he's an extreme case\\". Sturges also said that King wants to be \\"the most effective hero he can be and will do anything to achieve that goal\\". He also mentioned that King wants \\"to be trained as well as possible, and to take that training and use it effectively against the bad guys\\".Class is in Session: Matt Sturges Readies 2nd JSA Title By Vaneta Rogers. Posted: 12 November 2009 03:46 pm ET Fictional character biography In an Origins and Omens back-up story, Flash visited King Chimera in Rome, in which he said he knew his father and that he had arrived to talk to him about the Justice Society of America. King replied, \\"Well, it's about time\\".Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #24 (April 2009) King later appeared as Billy Armstrong's new roommate when they joined the JSA. King demonstrated his power of casting illusions, explaining that his father, \\"King\\" Standish, was a master of disguise. Wanting to perfect the art of illusion, Standish met with a member of a secret order on a distant island. The adepts of the order possessed the power to bend light and sound in order to cast illusions. King mentioned that his mother was able to have this power as well. While the JSA was in battle, King, Billy and Mr. Terrific stayed at the Brownstone, where Billy had gone to Mr. Terrific and stabbed him in the back.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #29 (September 2009) The JSA interrogated Billy, who claimed he didn't remember anything and was completely unaware of the situation. King was then accused of making Billy attack Mr. Terrific with presumed mind control powers after the JSA watched their security tape which showed Billy resisting against the attack. However, it was revealed that King was innocent and that Billy was actually a sociopath named Jeremy Karne and infiltrated the JSA to kidnap Obsidian. He stabbed Mr. Terrific so he wouldn't figure out who he really was.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #33 (January 2010) =JSA All-Stars= King ended up with the JSA All-Stars team when the Justice Society decided to split up in two teams after Jeremy's infiltration.JSA All-Stars #1 (February 2010) His switch to the team quickly showed changes in his personality and later revealed some of his past, which was never revealed in his first appearances in Justice Society of America. He played a helpful role when the All-Stars were faced against Johnny Sorrow and the rest of the Injustice Society, who had resurrected the King of Tears, a monstrous beast. Johnny had almost killed King by showing him his face,JSA All-Stars #4 (May 2010) but King was saved from death by Anna Fortune.JSA All-Stars #5 (June 2010) When the team went to the Subtle Realms to rescue Stargirl from Johnny, who was transforming into a human, King showed Johnny an illusion of his face, which severely injured him. The team soon escaped back to their base after rescuing Stargirl and destroying the King of Tears. King then helped Judomaster, who was grieving over the death of Damage, by creating an illusion of Damage's farewell message to her before his death, which she had never finished hearing earlier. This caused Judomaster to not go with her plan to murder her father's killer, Tiger, but instead subdued him and had him taken in by the police.JSA All-Stars #7 (August 2010) =Past revealed= Although King's full past and origin are still a mystery, bits of information were revealed about his past. During a mission at Parador, when Cyclone was severely injured, Anna transported her and King to a hospital of King's choice, which was one located at Ankara, Turkey. While Cyclone rested, it was revealed by Namita, an illusion King created of his deceased former lover, that she had died at the same hospital and that it was King's fault.JSA All-Stars #9 (October 2010) It was also revealed by Namita that King's mother, villagers and monks, were all dead due to King, as well. Cyclone then woke up, realizing that she felt better and that her wounds had already healed. King and Cyclone were then seen helping the rest of the team in Los Angeles to fight the Paradoran gods. Brainwave, who was helping the All-Stars, told the team that each one had to let something go from their past in order to weaken the power of the gods. King was forced to let go of Namita, saying he could no longer love a ghost. The All-Stars won the battle and King later made amends with Cyclone, as he had previously rejected their attraction toward each other before the mission at Parador.JSA All-Stars #11 (December 2010) Later, after finishing a dangerous mission in space, King had confirmed his feelings for Cyclone by kissing her.JSA All-Stars #13 (February 2011) Although Namita stated it was due to King's \\"brashness and conceit\\",JSA All-Stars #10 (November 2010) it is unknown what he did that caused the deaths of Namita, his mother and the villagers and monks. Characterization King Chimera was first portrayed as an arrogant, egotistical, classy \\"know-it-all\\" during his run in Justice Society of America. King was impatient, witty and quick to make a comeback, even if he was not being insulted in the first place. He found himself to be near perfection and thought of himself to be above everyone else. Due to his attitude, King was not well perceived by his teammates. However, King did not seem to care, as he stated that he was not with the Justice Society to make friends. Only a few months later, still early in his publication history, King's attitude began to slowly change in the JSA All- Stars series, beginning right after his near-death experience with Johnny Sorrow. He started to transition from his harsh attitude to a respected teammate. He also started to show more respect towards his teammates by helping them out more with their problems, specifically with Judomaster while she was dealing with the grief of Damage's death. Although King previously stated he was not with the team to make friends, Cyclone became his first and closest friend on the team. Although King's attitude has changed, he still shows signs of cockiness, but only toward his enemies. =Depiction= Throughout all of his appearances, King has sported a black suit, with a double-breasted jacket. He wears a black necktie, white gloves, and black leather shoes. He used to wear a golden handkerchief with a Three-point Fold, but in the JSA All-Stars series, a golden medallion took its place. When Hourman once asked him why he wore a suit, King made an illusion of himself in a spandex costume, saying, \\"See how ridiculous I'd look?\\".JSA All-Stars #14 (March 2011) Powers and abilities King Chimera was taught by his mother and/or father to bend light and sound in order to cast illusions. King explained to Sand that his power is to conjure anything he has seen or heard into a chimera; his power is to misdirect his enemies so they defeat themselves. King can also manipulate x-rays, which was shown when he made an illusion of himself being invisible and Power Girl could not see him, even if she used her x-ray vision.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #32 (December 2009) King possesses a genius intellect, has an eidetic memory, has highly trained senses and perfect recall.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #31 (November 2009) He is also skilled at hand-to-hand combat, however the only move he uses on his enemies, when he's not using his illusions, is to flip them. Once, Sand asked why he didn't hit anyone. King replied: \\"I have my reasons\\".JSA All-Stars #6 (July 2010) References External links *King Chimera at DC Wikia *King Chimera at Comic Vine DC Comics superheroes Comics characters introduced in 2009 Fictional illusionists ","title":"King Chimera"},{"id":"25083492","text":"The Kenosha Mountains or Kenosha MountainUSGS, GNIS 183221 are a subrange (or long mountain) of the Front Range located in Park and Jefferson counties of Colorado.

The Honour of Wallingford was established after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The Honour initially comprised the manors of Wallingford and Harpsden and thereafter gained numerous other manors. In the late 11th century Miles Crispin(d.1107) held the larger of the 2 estates contained within the manor of Alkerton in Oxfordshire,Domesday Book as part of the Honour of Wallingford.Lobel & Crossley, 1969, pages 44-53 After Crispin's death in 1107 his widow Maud supported the Empress Matilda during the Anarchy. When King Stephen defeated Matilda, Maud entered a religious houseLobel, 1964, pp. 16-43 and King Stephen gave her estate to Henry, Duke of Normandy. This made Aston Rowant part of the Honour of Wallingford. The Honour of Wallingford also included Newton Purcell. The honour of Wallingford is specifically mentioned in chapter 43 of Magna Carta of 1215 as being then in the hands of King John, having escheated from its previous holder. The chapter dealt with the barons' complaints about the levels of feudal relief due on lands held from such escheated baronies.Davis, G.R.C., Magna Carta, first published by the British Library Board in 1963, 8th reprint 1994, p.29 Until the 13th century, Chesterton, Oxfordshire was part of the honour. In 1360 Pyrton manor was recorded as part of the honour. In the 13th century the Honour of St. Valery passed to the Earl of Cornwall, who at that time also held the Honour of Wallingford. When Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall died childless in 1300, however, the Honour of St. Valery passed to the Crown.Crossley & Elrington, 1990, pages 219-224 By 1414, the Honour of St. Valery was part of this honour.Crossley & Elrington, 1990, pages 40-44 In 1540 the honour was separated from the Duchy of Cornwall by Act of Parliament (32 Hen. 8 c. 53), at which point it became part of the newly created Honour of Ewelme.Page & Ditchfield, 1923, pages 531‚Äì539 Recipients of the Honour of Wallingford include Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall, who was given it together with Cornwall by Edward II in 1307 (see Materials in cornish law). Thomas Chaucer was given the honour by Henry IV in 1399.

A single-engined biplane with a crew of three, it was unsuccessful, only two being built. Development and design In April 1932, the Imperial Japanese Navy placed orders with Mitsubishi and Nakajima for prototypes of three-seat torpedo-bombers to replace the relatively unsuccessful Mitsubishi B2M and the earlier Mitsubishi B1M aboard Japan's aircraft carriers.Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp. 230‚Äì231. Nakajima's design was a single-engined biplane with a slender circular section fuselage of steel tube construction. It had single-bay metal and fabric wings, with both the upper and lower wings gulled to meet the fuselage, with the upper wings gulled normally and the lower wings in an inverted gull arrangement, forming an X shape. It had a tailwheel undercarriage, with the main wheels attached to the lower wing where the gulled section joined the main wing. The new 700 hp (522 kW) Nakajima Hikari engine was chosen to power the aircraft, driving a three- bladed fixed-pitch metal propeller. Nakajima built two prototypes in 1933, with the internal designation Nakajima Y3B, as the Experimental 7-Shi Carrier Attack Aircraft, with the short designation B3N1 but the prototype Hikari engines proved unreliable, and the type was not accepted by the Navy. Mitsubishi's competing 7-Shi design, the Rolls-Royce Buzzard powered 3MT10 was also a failure, the sole prototype crashing on take-off in 1934,Mikesh and Abe 1990, p.170. with the design from the Navy's own Air Technical Arsenal at Yokosuka, which was started later than the competing designs from Mitsubishi and Nakajima and therefore managed to avoid some of their flaws, being ordered into production as the Yokosuka B3Y.Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp. 280‚Äì281.

One of a handful of non-Japanese carvers of netsuke, Lamb has built a reputation since the 1980s as one of the best living practitioners of this art. He is known for meticulous, graceful carvings, typically of animals. His preferred medium for carving is boxwood. Lamb was born in 1948 in Cambridge, England, and educated at Berkshire College, Maidenhead, Berkshire, England. He originally trained as a graphic designer, and was introduced to netsuke by someone who had seen a miniature carving he had done as a pastime. He began to carve full-time in 1988 and moved to the United States in 1995 to be closer to fellow carvers and netsuke collectors. Lamb says of his own work, \\"I work principally in wood, a material expressive of the natural world and living subjects that have always drawn me. Although I do work on a large scale, I am most comfortable carving intricate miniature sculptures that convey the precious quality and fragile existence that wild animals possess. Whether mammals, fish, birds, or insects, I compose my work around graceful unifying lines suggesting the interconnectedness of all life. In part because I am not Japanese, I have been more free to stretch the boundaries of the netsuke art form, which, like many Asian art forms, is highly bound by conventions that evolve minimally over long periods of time. Since 2001, I have been developing stylistically away from the rather traditional forms I have been following. I continue to be influenced by Japanese design, but now investigate different ways in which to apply my personal aesthetic interpretation‚Äîmy East-West hybrid‚Äîto larger format, particularly casting in bronze and stone-carving.\\" Lamb has created larger scale work for Turtle Bay Exploration Park in Redding, California, and the Yellowstone Art Museum in Billings, Montana. Nick Lamb, \\"Pygmy Owl\\" The group of non-Japanese netsuke carvers is small but distinguished and includes David Carlin, Clive Hallam, Janel Jacobson, Gerry Milazzo, Lynn Richardson, Leigh Sloggett, Gregg Stradiotto, and Sue Wraight, among others. Lamb is represented by Stewart-Kummer Gallery in Gualala, California, and shows work at Japanese art venues worldwide. His work has been included in temporary exhibitions in the US and Japan, including the Museum of Arts & Design in New York city, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and the Bowers Museum in California.

As a young man, Jim served in the US Navy, working with a meteorology unit at the US Weather Bureau headquarters near Washington, DC. It was during this period that he became a Catholic. His military service ended with an early discharge on grounds of conscientious objection. After leaving the navy, Jim joined the staff of the Catholic Worker community in Manhattan, working close with the founder, Dorothy Day, and for a time serving as managing editor of the journal she edited, The Catholic Worker. In 1964, while working as a journalist for the Staten Island Advance, in his spare time he co-founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship, working closely with Tom Cornell. This became a full-time job for both of them in 1965, a time that coincided with deepening US military engagement in Vietnam. The main focus of their work was counseling conscientious objectors. In 1968, while Jim working as Vietnam Program Coordinator of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, Jim and thirteen others, mainly Catholic clergy, broke into nine Milwaukee draft boards, removing and burning some of the files in a nearby park while holding a prayer service. Most members of the \\"Milwaukee Fourteen\\" served thirteen months in prison for their action. In the late sixties and mid-seventies, Jim also worked with the Fellowship of Reconciliation, first as Vietnam Program coordinator and later as editor of Fellowship magazine. From 1977 through 1988, he was Secretary General of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation, work which brought him to the Netherlands. He received the Peacemaker Award from Notre Dame University's Institute for International Peace Studies and the St. Marcellus Award from the Catholic Peace Fellowship. In 1988, Forest was received into the Orthodox Church. Since 1989, he has been international secretary of the as well as associate editor of its quarterly journal, In Communion. In 2017, he was ordained as Reader. Jim had a long-term friendship with Thomas Merton, who dedicated a book to him, Faith and Violence. Jim also accompanied the famed Vietnamese Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh. A journalist and writer, his books include Praying with Icons, Ladder of the Beatitudes, The Road to Emmaus: Pilgrimage as a Way of Life, Loving Our Enemies: Reflections on the Hardest Commandment, biographies of Thomas Merton (Living With Wisdom), Dorothy Day (All Is Grace) and Daniel Berrigan (At Play in the Lions' Den), and several children's books, including Saint Nicholas and the Nine Gold Coins, Saint George and the Dragon and Silent as a Stone: Mother Maria of Paris and the Trash Can Rescue.

He spends his first week exploring, and discovers that his Eden-like paradise is surrounded by a huge unscalable wall 50 miles in circumference. Furthermore, there are six gateways at roughly equal intervals, but there is no way to climb up there and see where they go. After a significant amount of exploring, he finds a single house that may hold the answers to his missing memory. How he could have missed it on first waking, is beyond him.

Birmingham Board of Education, 544 U.S. 167 (2005), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that retaliation against a person because that person has complained of sex discrimination is a form of intentional sex discrimination encompassed by Title IX.Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., .  Background  Roderick Jackson, a teacher in the Birmingham, Alabama, public school system, brought suit against the Birmingham Board of Education alleging that the board retaliated against him because he complained about sex discrimination at Ensley High School. Jackson, who had taught for six years prior in the Birmingham school district, was transferred to Ensley High School in August 1999 as a physical education teacher and girls' basketball coach. Jackson discovered that Ensley High School did not provide equal funding and access to athletic equipment and facilities for the girls' teams. In December 2000, Jackson began complaining of the unequal treatment, and began receiving negative evaluations. Jackson was removed as the girls' basketball coach in May 2001.https://www.oyez.org/cases/2004/02-1672 The United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama dismissed Jackson's claims on the grounds that Title IX's private right of action does not include claims of retaliation. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court holding that Title IX does not provide a private right of action for retaliation.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writing for a 5-4 majority held that retaliation against individuals because they complain of sex discrimination is intentional conduct that violates the terms of Title IX. O'Connor analogized the case to Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc.,. which held that 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1982. provided a cause of action for retaliation for advocacy for African Americans. Because Sullivan interpreted a general prohibition on racial discrimination to cover retaliation against those who advocate the rights of groups protected by that prohibition, so too should Title IX be read to prohibit retaliation for advocacy on behalf of those subjected to sex discrimination.  Dissent  Justice Clarence Thomas authored a dissent joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy. Thomas argued that retaliatory conduct is not discrimination on the basis of sex under the plain terms of Title IX.Jackson, 544 U.S. at 184-85 (Thomas, J., dissenting).

In February 2014 it was on display in the National Gallery, London, on loan from a private collection. History The painting is thought to have been commissioned by either Benedetto (1554‚Äì1621) or his brother Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564‚Äì1637) since it appears in the 1638 Giustiniani inventory. Paintings of Saints Matthew, Mark and Luke (by Nicolas R√©gnier, Francesco Albani and Guido Reni respectively) are also included, all stated to be the same size as the Saint John. It has been suggested therefore that the four paintings were originally intended as a series. Despite the prestigious commission, the date of the painting's execution remains unclear. Richard E. Spear, author of numerous publications on 17th-century Italian painting and one of the foremost scholars on the life and work of Domenichino, put the work at around 1627 to 1629. This is due to stylistic similarities with works such as the Sant'Andrea della Valle's Saint John. An alternative theory, put forward in Squarzina's analysis of the 1938 Giustiniani inventory, speculates that the work could be from before 1621. Others have concluded dates between 1624 and 1628. The painting descended via Vincenzo Giustiniani's heir to Prince Benedetto Giustiniani, in whose posthumous inventory of 1793 it appears, then to Andrea Giustiniani, who in 1804 declined a purchase offer of 6,500 scudi for it. Andrea then had it taken to Paris, probably before 1806, where he sold it to Alexis Delahante. Delahante and W. Harris then sold it to Richard Hart Davis and it was then sold in around 1813 with the rest of Davis's collection to Philip John Miles. Inherited firstly by his son, William Miles then his grandson Philip Miles, the picture was kept at Leigh Court where it, along with others in the family's extensive collection, could be viewed upon application. The impact of the Long Depression and an agricultural crisis depressing farm prices due to cheap imports from abroad, however, simultaneously attacked this landowning and banking family's sources of income and caused Sir Philip to seek to sell in 1884 at Christie's where part of the collection was among the first to be sold under the terms of Gladstone's Settled Lands Act. However, Domenichino and his contemporaries had by then gone out of fashion with British buyers and the Saint John the Evangelist remained unsold. It was then auctioned at Christie's again in 1899 on the death of Cecil Miles, 3rd Baronet who was Philip John Miles's great-grandson ‚Äì this time it was bought in at 100 guineas and subsequently sold for 70 guineas to M. Colnaghi, acting as agent for Augustus Langham Christie of Tapeley Park, Devonshire and Glyndebourne, East Sussex, part of the Christie family. The painting passed down through that family (later headed by John Christie and known for their connection to the Glyndebourne Festival Opera) for more than a century until it was auctioned in London in December 2009 to an American buyer for ¬£9.2 million. However, it was then the object of an export bar to keep it in the United Kingdom due to its history of ownership in the country. British galleries were unable to raise enough money to buy it (the National Gallery and National Galleries of Scotland already being committed to an expensive deal to buy Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto, both by Titian), but another anonymous collector was allowed to acquire it on the condition that it be displayed to the public for three months each year. He then loaned it to the National Gallery in London from May 2010 to August 2011, where it had previously been displayed from 1992 to 1994.Glyndebourne family to sell Old Master for ¬£10 million, London Evening Standard, 9 Sept 2009'Saved' Domenichino painting loaned to National Gallery, Guardian, 18 May 2010 Description Saint John the Evangelist is depicted as a young man accompanied by his traditional symbol the eagle and two putti. His gaze is directed upwards towards God as he receives the inspiration for his gospel, emphasised by the strong chiaroscuro light bearing down upon him. This was typical of the artist's style, continuing in the manner of late Raphael and his own master Annibale Carracci. The composition is said to have been inspired by classical sculpture, with some commentators pointing specifically to The Laocoon. This is also evident in Domenichino's other large-scale treatments of the subject such as Madonna and Child with the Saints John the Evangelist and Petronius and the pendentive in the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle. The painting also includes an example of the artist's landscape painting, an aspect of his work that was particularly influential on the likes of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. This element of the work was originally more compressed into the right-hand section of the canvas, the architecture taking precedence. However, Domenichino reconsidered this layout and over painted an extension of the landscape onto the wall. Other alterations are also visible in the books, the hand of the right putto and the larger hill of the landscape.

The thick bark is grey and fissured, with an orange inner layer. The leaves are alternate, thick, leathery, oblong or elliptical, and measure long and wide. The upper surfaces of the leaves are glabrous and shiny green, while the lower surfaces are dull and may feature bronze or reddish brown pressed hairs. The hairs are sometimes found only on the tips of new leaves (see photo gallery below). Inflorescences with one to four bell-shaped flowers are found at the bases of leaves. The fruit, a berry, is in diameter and yellow, orange, or purplish black. Each fruit contains one to five seeds, which are about long and yellow brown. Uses The wood of ƒÅlaa is yellow with black streaks, extremely hard, and close grained. Native Hawaiians used it in house construction and to make the pale (gunwales) of waa (outrigger canoes), ≈ç≈ç (digging sticks), and ihe (spears). The sticky, milky sap was used as a kol≈´ (glue) for weapon and tool handles and as kƒìpau (birdlime), much like papala kepau (Pisonia spp.).

He played for Cornell University in 1915, 1916 and 1919, and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1916. He was posthumously inducted into Cornell's Hall of Fame in 1987. Biography A native of Chicago, Illinois, Shiverick graduated in 1914 from the University School of Chicago where he had played halfback for three years. Shiverick then enrolled at Cornell, where he played for the school's varsity football team from 1915-1916 and 1919. =1915 season= As a sophomore in 1915, Shiverick began the season as a substitute back for the Cornell varsity. He made a name for himself in Cornell's 1915 victory over Percy Haughton's 1915 Harvard team‚Äîthe first loss suffered by Harvard since 1911. Replacing Charley Barrett, Shiverick came into the game with a 7-0 lead. Backed up to their own goal line, Cornell was forced to punt into a strong wind. Shiverick was called on to punt for Cornell and kicked the ball 86 yards for what proved to be the longest punt of the year in college football. Later in the same game, Shiverick drop-kicked the ball for a field goal from the 40-yard line. Shiverick's teammate Ray Van Orman later described Shiverick's long punt against Harvard as the headiest play he ever saw. Van Orman wrote that Shiverick called a couple of signals and then stalled for time. Shiverick was punting into the open end of the stadium with the wind pouring in. Shiverick tossed grass into the air and noted that, after the wind blew the grass back, it was picked up by \\"a reverse current that would carry it up the field as though it were flying against the wind.\\" Concluding that the wind was circling through the stadium like a whirlpool, Shivercik delayed the snap from center until he felt a reverse current. He then drove a low, hard kick that was carried by the reverse current over the head of Harvard's safety man, Eddie Mahan. After the 1915 season, Shiverick was selected for Outing magazine's Football Roll of Honor. =1916 season= In 1916, Shiverick returned as Cornell's starting quarterback and led the Big Red to wins over Michigan and Penn. In Cornell's 23-20 win over Michigan, he drop-kicked two field goals, including one from the 45-yard line. After the 1916 season, Shiverick was selected as a first-team All-American by the United Press and sports writer Paul Purman, and a second-team All-American by the International News Service and Michigan Coach Fielding H. Yost. Shiverick was also selected for membership in the Quill and Dagger society and elected captain of the 1917 Cornell football team. The press reported: > \\"The famous general of the Big Red eleven, who last year beat Harvard with > his punting and was the main factor in the defeat this season of Michigan, > is to be elected unanimously, it was announced last night. Shiverick is > playing his second year on the 'varsity. He is a junior and a member of the > Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.\\" =World War I= Before the 1917 football season began, the United States entered World War I, and he joined the U.S. Army. During the fall of 1917, Shiverick starred for the Camp Grant football team that included Shiverick, Harry Costello Jerry DePrado, Gene Schobinger and Nelson Norgren. In the biggest game of the 1917 football season, a game between college football stars serving in the military held at Chicago's Stagg Field on December 1, 1917, Shiverick was the star, scoring eight of Camp Grant's fourteen points on a touchdown and two extra points. In 1918, Shiverick served in France as a captain in the Provost Marshal General's department. =1919 season= After being discharged from the military at the end of World War I, Shiverick returned to Cornell. In his first game back after the war, Shiverick led Cornell to a 9-0 win over Oberlin College: > \\"Captain Fritz Shiverick, Cornell quarterback, playing lor the first time > since 1917, was the star of the game. He kicked a difficult field goal from > the 20-yard line in the first quarter. In the second quarter be broke > through on a play off right tackle, shook off all tacklers and ran 67 yards > for a touchdown.\\" He also kicked a field goal that provided all of the scoring in a 3-0 victory over Williams College. In a 20-0 victory over Carnegie Tech, Shiverick scored all of Cornell's points on two touchdowns, including a 45-yard run through a broken field in the third period, and two field goals, including a drop-kick from the 41-yard line. He became known as \\"a scoring machine,\\" \\"the strongest punter\\" in the country and \\"the greatest individual star since Eddie Mahan.\\" In addition to serving as Cornell's quarterback, Shiverick also served as the punter, drop kicker, kickoff returner and play-caller on both offense and defense. =Later years and honors= After graduating from Cornell, Shiverick returned to Chicago where he became the co-owner of the Tobey Furniture Company. He died in Chicago in 1936. Shiverick was posthumously inducted into the Cornell Hall of Fame in 1987.

The larger Avco Records soon signed the Stylistics, and the single eventually climbed to number seven on the R&B; charts in early 1971. Avco approached record producer Thom Bell to work with the group. After the Stylistics auditioned for Bell he was unimpressed, but he ultimately agreed to produce them, because he believed in the potential of Thompkins's soaring high tenor voice. Thom Bell focused the group's sound completely around Thompkins's voice. On most of the group's hits, Bell would have Thompkins sing virtually solo. From 1971 to 1974, the Stylistics had twelve consecutive U.S. R&B; top ten hits and five top ten U.S. pop hits, including \\"Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)\\", \\"You Are Everything\\", \\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\\", \\"Break Up to Make Up\\", and \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\". All of these songs (and everything the group ever recorded) were led by Thompkins, and with the exception of \\"You're a Big Girl Now\\", written and composed by Thom Bell and lyricist Linda Creed (1974's \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\", a No. 2 pop hit, was also sung lead by group member Airron Love). Thom Bell stopped working with the group in 1974, and the split proved commercially devastating to the group's success in the U.S. However, in 1975, the Stylistics did release one single which was commercially successful as an early disco track entitled, \\"Hey, Girl, Come and Get It\\". After 1976, the Stylistics general commercial decline was more pronounced, and they would only sporadically make the R&B; charts in the next two decades. However, just as U.S. success began to wane, their popularity in Europe, and especially the United Kingdom, increased. The lighter \\"pop\\" sound fashioned by Van McCoy and Hugo & Luigi gave the band a UK No. 1 in 1975 with \\"Can't Give You Anything (But My Love)\\". In 2000, Thompkins left the group saying he even regretted he had not left much earlier. After his split from the group, Thompkins studied music formally and learned to play the piano. In 2002, he released a solo album entitled A Matter of Style, which includes cover versions of George and Ira Gershwin's \\"Embraceable You\\" and the Thom Bell and Linda Creed song \\"Jealousy\\", originally recorded by Dionne Warwick. In 2004, Thompkins Jr. started a new group, Russell Thompkins Jr. and the New Stylistics, with Raymond Johnson, James Ranton, and Jonathan Buckson. They continue to tour and are featured on the DVD Old School Soul Party Live!, which was part of the PBS My Music series. James Ranton left the group due to health reasons but the group continues as a trio.

It is formed by the fusion of the mesodermal layers of two extra-embryonic membranes ‚Äì the chorion and the allantois. It is the avian homologue of the mammalian placenta. It is the outermost extra-embryonic membrane which lines the non-vascular egg shell membrane.  Structure  The chorioallantoic membrane is composed of three layers. The first is the chorionic epithelium that is the external layer present immediately below the shell membrane. It consist of epithelial cells that arise from chorionic ectoderm. The second is the intermediate mesodermal layer that consists of mesenchymal tissue formed by the fusion of the mesodermal layer of the chorion and the mesodermal layer of the allantois. This layer is highly vascularized and rich in stromal components. The third is the allantoic epithelium that consists of epithelial cells arising from the allantoic ectoderm. It forms a part of the wall of the allantoic sac. Both the epithelial layers are separated from the mesodermal layer by basement membranes.  Function  The Chorioallantoic membrane performs the following functions: The CAM functions as the site of gaseous exchange for oxygen and carbon dioxide between the growing embryo and the environment. Blood capillaries and sinuses are found in the intermediate mesodermal layer allows close contact (within 0.2 Œºm) with air found in pores of the shell membrane of the egg. The chorionic epithelial layer contains the calcium transporting region of the CAM, and thus is responsible for the transport of calcium ions from the egg shell into the embryo for the purpose of ossification of the bones of the developing embryo. The CAM also helps in maintaining the acid-base homeostasis in the embryo. Finally the allantoic epithelium serves a barrier to the allantoic cavity, and acts in a selectively permeable manner by permitting the absorption of water and electrolytes, as well as maintains a barrier against the toxins and waste materials stored inside the allantoic cavity.  Development  The development of the CAM is similar to that of the allantois in mammals. Its growth starts from day 3 of embryonic development. Development of the allantois occurs extra embryonically from the ventral wall of the endodermal hindgut. Partial fusion of the chorion and allantois occurs between days 5 and 6. By day 10, there is an extensive formation of capillary network. The complete differentiation of the CAM is complete by day 13.  Cultivation protocols  Chorioallantoic membranes can be cultivated either outside (ex- ovo) or inside of the shell (in-ovo). = Ex-ovo = Here, the embryo is grown outside of the shell. In this method, the eggs are first kept in inside a humidified incubator for up to a period of 3 days, to ensure that the position of the embryo is opposite to the position where the egg will be subsequently cracked. A small hole is made on the side of the air chamber to equilibrate the pressure, followed by the cracking of the egg on a petri-dish. This method is ideal for visualizing the growing embryo and their manipulation without limitations in accessing the embryo during the different stages of development. However the process requires aseptic conditions. There are also problems associated with the handling of the embryo, as the yolk membrane is prone to rupture both during and after the culture. = In-ovo = Here, the embryo is grown within the confines of the egg shell. In this method, fertilized eggs are rotated inside an incubator for three days in order to prevent the embryo from sticking to the membranes of the shell. A hole is then created on the eggshell and wrapped with a film to prevent dehydration and infections. The egg is then maintained in a static position until further use. This step prevents the CAM from sticking to the shell membrane. At day 7 post- fertilisation, the hole is extended in order to access the CAM. This method offers several advantages over the ex-vivo method as the physiological environment for the developing embryo remains virtually unchanged. It is easier to maintain sterility as well the integrity of the CAM and the embryo when they are present inside the shell. However good technical skills are required for this method. The presence of the shell around the developing embryo makes access to the embryo difficult. There are also limitations in the observing and imaging of the developing embryo.  Applications  CAM provides several features such as ease of access, and the rapid development of the membrane structure, presence of an immunodeficient environment, ease of visualization for imaging techniques ranging from microscopic to PET scans. Thus, it makes for a suitable model for a number of research applications in the field of biological and biomedical research: * Vascular development and angiogenesis. * Xenograft studies. * Study of tumour growth and differentiation. * Wound repair studies. * Toxicology studies. * Drug delivery. * Study of molecules affecting with angiogenic and anti-angiogenic activities. * Culturing of viruses like Herpes Simplex Virus, etc. * Drug screening studies. * Radiotherapy related studies. * Allergenicity and toxicity studies. * Helminth cultivation.  Advantages  The advantages of using CAM are: * It is easy to use as compared to other animal models. * Assays can be visualized real time using very simple to highly complex visualizing techniques. * Rapid vascular growth. * Cost effective, easy to access. * The circulatory system is completely accessible making the delivery of intravenous molecules easy. * Assays take relatively less time. * Easily reproducible and reliable.  Disadvantages  Despite the numerous advantages, there are a number of disadvantages associated with the use CAMs: * Sensitivity to modifications in environmental conditions. * Limited availability of reagents like antibodies due to avian origin. * Non-specific inflammatory reaction after 15 days of development. * Difficulty of distinguishing the formation of new capillaries from the already existing vascular network. * Differences in metabolism of drugs as compared to mammals.

Life Vladimir Timirev was born in 1914 as the son of Admiral Sergey Nikolayevich Timiryov of the Russian Imperial Navy. His mother was the poet Anna Timiryova. His maternal grandfather was the composer orchestra conductor Vasily Ilyich Safonov. In 1918, when he was only four years old, his parents separated. His mother commenced a common law marriage with Rear Admiral Alexander Kolchak, who became Vladimir's \\"stepfather.\\" Vladimir's father Sergey subsequently moved to China as a White √©migr√©. During the Russian Civil War, Alexander Kolchak led one of the largest factions of the anti-communist White Movement based at Omsk. In February 1920, Vladimir's stepfather was betrayed by his allies and handed over to the Bolsheviks in Irkutsk. He was given a cursory trial and shot, whereupon his body was cast into the frozen Angara River. For decades after his death, however, their association with Kolchak would have dire consequences for Vladimir and his mother. Timirev graduated from the Moscow Architectural Institute. Upon completing his first year in 1930, he worked on the construction site of the Bobrikov Chemical Industrial Complex. After graduation, he worked as an artist and book illustrator. Jack London‚Äôs book ‚ÄúNorthern Tales‚Äù was published with Timirev‚Äôs illustrations. He published his drawings in newspapers for the reviews of stage plays. Timirev participated in a science and research expedition to the Caspian Sea in 1935. During the expedition, he produced many sketches, drawings and water colours on the subject of the Caspian Sea. He also created a series of works about Vyshniy Volochok. Arrest and execution He was arrested by the NKVD in 1938 and shortly afterwards executed by shooting. Apparently, the reason was an anonymous denunciation made by friends. The denunciation referred to the fact that Vladimir was the \\"stepson\\" of Admiral Kolchak, who was demonized in the Soviet propaganda of the time.

Most of the music tends to focus on electronic, pre-MIDI instrumentation and themes of sincere, rather than ironic, detachment. The terming of \\"minimal wave\\" draws some contention. Although much minimal wave is classified in the late 1970s and early 1980s and subsequently appeared on bootleg and one-off compilations, the genre didn't have a name until a record label of the same name began releasing compilations and reissues in the mid-2000s. Background and etymology Veronica Vasicka, founder of the Minimal Wave record label, claims to have coined the genre name. She said in a 2009 interview, For a 2009 publicity piece, Vasicka wrote that the music overlaps with several other genres, \\"The Minimal Wave genre actually formed only several years ago, as a result of a resurgence of interest in the roots of pre-MIDI electronic new wave (1978‚Äì1985), mainly from North America, Europe and Japan. This music is sometimes referred to as minimal electronic, minimal synth, coldwave, new wave, technopop, or synthpop, depending on the particular style, year, and location of the band.\\" In its heyday, the music's demographic had subcultures all over the world, but was most critical in Europe (particularly the UK) and the US, where the machines used to create this type of music were readily available. The fanzine CLEM (Contact List Of Electronic Musicians) helped create a worldwide community of musicians in the genre, prior to the use of the Internet. Many of the musicians in the genre collaborated via mail. Characteristics According to Vasicka, the genre's hallmarks include minimal musical structures, relatively unpolished production, and the use of analog synthesizers and drum machines manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s. The instrumental arrangements featured \\"mechanical beats\\" and \\"short repetitive patterns\\", plus \\"noticeably synthesized drum programming and trebly, thin melodies\\" which emphasized the artificiality of synthesized sound. Vocal arrangements \\"acted as a counterpoint to that artificiality.\\" Musicians in the genre were often influenced by avant-garde movements such as futurism and constructivism, and by the literature of science fiction and existentialism.

It lies directly adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad's Minneapolis-to-Omaha Line. Main highways include: *20px U.S. Highway 59 *20px Minnesota State Highway 60 History =Origin of name= Org was originally called Islen, after Adrian C. Iselin, one of the directors of the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad Company. The year was 1872, and no town existed. Iselin consisted of a section house and a water-stop. Steam locomotives consumed enormous quantities of water, and water-stops were established every 8 to 12 miles along any rail route. Iselin was one of these. When the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad Company built a spur line from Iselin to Sioux Falls in 1876, the name of the site was changed to Sioux Falls Junction. In 1890 the name was changed to Org by W.A. Scott, a general manager of the Chicago & Northwestern Railway, the company that absorbed the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad Company. He considered the railroad junction an ideal location for a town. The significance of the name \\"Org\\" remains obscure; it may be derived from \\"dog\\". The town was platted in 1899, and a railroad station was built on the Chicago & Northwestern Railway's main St Paul to Sioux City line.Names of Nobles County by Raymond Crippen Even though Org never became incorporated, a post office was established between 1895-1917.GNIS Data on Org Post Office =Distinguished visitors= Two American presidents briefly visited Org. Theodore Roosevelt traveled through Org when he was running for president in 1912 as the Bull Moose Party candidate. Woodrow Wilson passed through in 1919 on his nationwide tour to sell the Treaty of Versailles to the nation. Roosevelt actually stopped in Org and spoke from the back of his train. Wilson's train merely slowed enough to switch from the main Chicago & Northwestern track to the Sioux Falls spur line. =Org's heyday= For many years, the town had but one street‚Äîthe old wagon road that connected Worthington, Minnesota with Sibley, Iowa. When a paved highway was built in 1931 (U.S. Route 59 / Minnesota State Highway 60), it paralleled the wagon road about 50 yards to the southwest. A one-block long road was constructed connecting the two existing roads, and this third roadway became Org's main business district, at one time boasting several businesses. In its heyday, the town had a post office, a railroad station, a grain elevator, a general store, a lumber company, a coal company, and a filling station. History of Nobles County, By A. P. Rose =Org's decline= The Sioux Falls spur line of the Chicago & Northwestern Railway was never widely used, and by the 1950s, the line was all but abandoned. Org's decline soon followed. The grain elevator and railroad station closed. The general store and the filling station followed. By the 1970s, the town consisted of just a few family homes, an abandoned grain elevator, and several dilapidated buildings. =Org today= The last person who claimed to be Mayor of Org, Mark Marcotte, left the town in about 1980, though there is no evidence that Mr. Marcott was actually elected to that post. In 2000, Org's original roadway was downgraded to a \\"minimum maintenance roadway\\", and by 2010, many of the remaining homes were bought up by the State of Minnesota to make way for the upgrading of Minnesota State Highway 60 from two lanes to four lanes. The former Chicago & Northwestern Railroad line is now operated by Union Pacific, and is busier than ever. But as for Org, nearly every trace of the town is gone.

Jose Rizal (June 20, 2014). Retrieved on 2017-07-07. (; June 19, 1861 ‚Äì December 30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist and polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. He is tagged as the national hero (pambansang bayani) of the Filipino people. An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain. He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution, inspired in part by his writings, broke out. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals which eventually led to Philippine independence. He is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be so honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee. However, no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or issued officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a national hero. He was the author of the novels Noli Me T√°ngere and El filibusterismo, and a number of poems and essays. Early life Jos√© Rizal's baptismal register Francisco Rizal Mercado (1818‚Äì1898) Jos√© Rizal was born in 1861 to Francisco Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and Teodora Alonso Realonda y Quintos in the town of Calamba in Laguna province. He had nine sisters and one brother. His parents were leaseholders of a hacienda and an accompanying rice farm by the Dominicans. Both their families had adopted the additional surnames of Rizal and Realonda in 1849, after Governor General Narciso Claver√≠a y Zald√∫a decreed the adoption of Spanish surnames among the Filipinos for census purposes (though they already had Spanish names). Like many families in the Philippines, the Rizals were of mixed origin. Jos√©'s patrilineal lineage could be traced back to Fujian in China through his father's ancestor Lam-Co, a Chinese merchant who immigrated to the Philippines in the late 17th century.Grouped references: *Remarks on the occasion of the 114th death anniversary of Dr. Jose Rizal, 30 December 2010, Berlin, Embassy of the Philippines in Berlin *http://www.oovrag.com/essays/essay2010c-3.shtml *The Mercado - Rizal Family, joserizal.ph *Rizal's Family Tree and Ancestry, allaboutjoserizal.weebly.com *Genealogoy of Jose Rizal, xhellephyeom23.files.wordpress.com *Family Tree, akosimendozaabby.files.wordpress.com Lam-Co traveled to Manila from Xiamen, China, possibly to avoid the famine or plague in his home district, and more probably to escape the Manchu invasion during the Transition from Ming to Qing. He finally decided to stay in the islands as a farmer. In 1697, to escape the bitter anti-Chinese prejudice that existed in the Philippines, he converted to Catholicism, changed his name to Domingo Mercado and married the daughter of Chinese friend Augustin Chin-co. On his mother's side, Rizal's ancestry included Chinese, Japanese and Tagalog blood. His mother's lineage can be traced to the affluent Florentina family of Chinese mestizo families originating in Baliuag, Bulacan. He also had Spanish ancestry. Regina Ochoa, a grandmother of his mother, Teodora, had mixed Spanish, Chinese and Tagalog blood. His grandfather was a half Spaniard engineer named Lorenzo Alberto Alonzo. From an early age, Jos√© showed a precocious intellect. He learned the alphabet from his mother at 3, and could read and write at age 5. Upon enrolling at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, he dropped the last three names that made up his full name, on the advice of his brother, Paciano and the Mercado family, thus rendering his name as \\"Jos√© Protasio Rizal\\". Of this, he later wrote: \\"My family never paid much attention [to our second surname Rizal], but now I had to use it, thus giving me the appearance of an illegitimate child!\\"Vicente L. Rafael On Rizal's El Filibusterismo, University of Washington, Dept. of History. This was to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother, who had gained notoriety with his earlier links to Filipino priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora (popularly known as Gomburza) who had been accused and executed for treason. Rizal's house in Calamba, Laguna Despite the name change, Jos√©, as \\"Rizal\\", soon distinguished himself in poetry writing contests, impressing his professors with his facility with Castilian and other foreign languages, and later, in writing essays that were critical of the Spanish historical accounts of the pre-colonial Philippine societies. Indeed, by 1891, the year he finished his El filibusterismo, this second surname had become so well known that, as he writes to another friend, \\"All my family now carry the name Rizal instead of Mercado because the name Rizal means persecution! Good! I too want to join them and be worthy of this family name...\\" Education Rizal, 11 years old, a student at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila Rizal first studied under Justiniano Aquino Cruz in Bi√±an, Laguna, before he was sent to Manila. As to his father's request, he took the entrance examination in Colegio de San Juan de Letran but he then enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and graduated as one of the nine students in his class declared sobresaliente or outstanding. He continued his education at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila to obtain a land surveyor and assessor's degree, and at the same time at the University of Santo Tomas where he did take up a preparatory course in law and finished with a mark of excelente or excellent. He finished the course of Philosophy as a pre-law. Upon learning that his mother was going blind, he decided to switch to medicine at the medical school of Santo Tomas specializing later in ophthalmology. He received his four-year practical training in medicine at Ospital de San Juan de Dios in Intramuros. In his last year at medical school, he received a mark of sobresaliente in courses of Patologia Medica (Medical Pathology), Patolog√≠a Quir√∫rgica (Surgical Pathology) and Obstretics. Rizal, known for being an intelligent student, had some difficulty in some subjects in medical school such as F√≠sica (Physics) and Patolog√≠a General (General Pathology). One of the causes is due to the evident discrimination of the Profesor to Filipino students. Rizal as a student at the University of Santo Tomas Without his parents' knowledge and consent, but secretly supported by his brother Paciano, he traveled alone to Madrid, Spain in May 1882 and studied medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid where he earned the degree, Licentiate in Medicine. He also attended medical lectures at the University of Paris and the University of Heidelberg. In Berlin, he was inducted as a member of the Berlin Ethnological Society and the Berlin Anthropological Society under the patronage of the famous pathologist Rudolf Virchow. Following custom, he delivered an address in German in April 1887 before the Anthropological Society on the orthography and structure of the Tagalog language. He left Heidelberg a poem, \\"A las flores del Heidelberg\\", which was both an evocation and a prayer for the welfare of his native land and the unification of common values between East and West. At Heidelberg, the 25-year-old Rizal completed in 1887 his eye specialization under the renowned professor, Otto Becker. There he used the newly invented ophthalmoscope (invented by Hermann von Helmholtz) to later operate on his own mother's eye. From Heidelberg, Rizal wrote his parents: \\"I spend half of the day in the study of German and the other half, in the diseases of the eye. Twice a week, I go to the bierbrauerie, or beerhall, to speak German with my student friends.\\" He lived in a Karlstra√üe boarding house then moved to Ludwigsplatz. There, he met Reverend Karl Ullmer and stayed with them in Wilhelmsfeld, where he wrote the last few chapters of Noli Me T√°ngere. Rizal was a polymath, skilled in both science and the arts. He painted, sketched, and made sculptures and woodcarving. He was a prolific poet, essayist, and novelist whose most famous works were his two novels, Noli Me T√°ngere and its sequel, El filibusterismo. These social commentaries during the Spanish colonization of the country formed the nucleus of literature that inspired peaceful reformists and armed revolutionaries alike. Rizal was also a polyglot, conversant in twenty-two languages.Frank Laubach, Rizal: Man and Martyr (Manila: Community Publishers, 1936).Witmer, Christoper (June 2, 2001). \\"Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not)\\".

Besides poetry and creative writing, he dabbled, with varying degrees of expertise, in architecture, cartography, economics, ethnology, anthropology, sociology, dramatics, martial arts, fencing and pistol shooting. He was also a Freemason, joining Acacia Lodge No. 9 during his time in Spain and becoming a Master Mason in 1884. Personal life, relationships and ventures Rednaxela Terrace, where Rizal lived during his self-imposed exile in Hong Kong (photo taken in 2011) Jos√© Rizal's life is one of the most documented of 19th century Filipinos due to the vast and extensive records written by and about him.Kalaw, Teodoro.\\"Epistolario Rizalino: 4 volumes, 1400 letters to and from Rizal\\". Bureau of Printing, Manila. Almost everything in his short life is recorded somewhere, being himself a regular diarist and prolific letter writer, much of the material having survived. His biographers, however, have faced difficulty in translating his writings because of Rizal's habit of switching from one language to another. They drew largely from his travel diaries with their insights of a young Asian encountering the West for the first time. They included his later trips, home and back again to Europe through Japan and the United States, and, finally, through his self-imposed exile in Hong Kong. Shortly after he graduated from the Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now Ateneo de Manila University), Rizal (who was then 16 years old) and a friend, Mariano Katigbak, came to visit Rizal's maternal grandmother in Tondo, Manila. Mariano brought along his sister, Segunda Katigbak, a 14-year-old Batangue√±a from Lipa, Batangas. It was the first time they met and Rizal described Segunda as \\"rather short, with eyes that were eloquent and ardent at times and languid at others, rosy‚Äìcheeked, with an enchanting and provocative smile that revealed very beautiful teeth, and the air of a sylph; her entire self diffused a mysterious charm.\\" His grandmother's guests were mostly college students and they knew that Rizal had skills in painting. They suggested that Rizal should make a portrait of Segunda. He complied reluctantly and made a pencil sketch of her. Unfortunately for Rizal who had referred to her as his first love in his memoir Memorias de un Estudiante de Manila, Katigbak was already engaged to Manuel Luz. Business card showing Dr. Jos√© Rizal is an ophthalmologist in Hong Kong From December 1891 to June 1892, Rizal lived with his family in Number 2 of Rednaxela Terrace, Mid-levels, Hong Kong Island. Rizal used 5 D'Aguilar Street, Central district, Hong Kong Island, as his ophthalmologist clinic from 2 pm to 6 pm. This period of his life included his recorded affections of which nine were identified. They were Gertrude Beckett of Chalcot Crescent, Primrose Hill, Camden, London, wealthy and high-minded Nelly Boustead of the English and Iberian merchant family, last descendant of a noble Japanese family Seiko Usui (affectionately called O-Sei-san), his earlier friendship with Segunda Katigbak, Leonor Valenzuela, and eight-year romantic relationship with a distant cousin, Leonor Rivera (popularly thought to be the inspiration for the character of Mar√≠a Clara in Noli me tangere). =Affair= In one recorded account detailing Rizal's 1887 visit to Prague, Maximo Viola wrote that Rizal succumbed to the temptation of a 'lady of the camellias'. Viola, a friend of Rizal's and an early financier of Noli Me Tangere, was alluding to Dumas's 1848 novel, La dame aux camelias, about a man who fell in love with a courtesan. While the affair was on record, there were no further details in Viola's letter concerning the duration and nature of the affair. Ambeth Ocampo (1990). \\"Rizal without the Overcoat\\".

Retrieved on December 3, 2011. Rivera and Rizal first met in Manila when Rivera was only 14 years old. When Rizal left for Europe on May 3, 1882, Rivera was 16 years of age. Their correspondence began when Rizal left a poem for Rivera saying farewell. The correspondence between Rivera and Rizal kept him focused on his studies in Europe. They employed codes in their letters because Rivera's mother did not favor Rizal. A letter from Mariano Katigbak dated June 27, 1884, referred to Rivera as Rizal's \\"betrothed\\". Katigbak described Rivera as having been greatly affected by Rizal's departure, frequently sick because of insomnia. When Rizal returned to the Philippines on August 5, 1887, Rivera and her family had moved back to Dagupan, Pangasinan. Rizal was forbidden by his father Francisco Mercado to see Rivera in order to avoid putting the Rivera family in danger because at the time Rizal was already labeled by the criollo elite as a filibustero or subversive because of his novel Noli Me T√°ngere. Rizal wanted to marry Rivera while he was still in the Philippines because of Rivera's uncomplaining fidelity. Rizal asked permission from his father one more time before his second departure from the Philippines. The meeting never happened. In 1888, Rizal stopped receiving letters from Rivera for a year, although Rizal kept sending letters to Rivera. The reason for Rivera's year of silence was the connivance between Rivera's mother and the Englishman named Henry Kipping, a railway engineer who fell in love with Rivera and was favored by Rivera's mother.Leonor Rivera, Jos√© Rizal University, joserizal.phCoates, Austin. \\"Leonor Rivera\\", Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr, Oxford University Press (Hong Kong), pp. 52‚Äì54, 60, 84, 124, 134‚Äì136, 143, 169, 185‚Äì188, 258. The news of Leonor Rivera's marriage to Kipping devastated Rizal. His European friends kept almost everything he gave them, including doodlings on pieces of paper. In the home of a Spanish liberal, Pedro Ortiga y P√©rez, he left an impression that was to be remembered by his daughter, Consuelo. In her diary, she wrote of a day Rizal spent there and regaled them with his wit, social graces, and sleight-of-hand tricks. In London, during his research on Antonio de Morga's writings, he became a regular guest in the home of Reinhold Rost of the British Museum who referred to him as \\"a gem of a man.\\" The family of Karl Ullmer, pastor of Wilhelmsfeld, and the Blumentritts saved even buttonholes and napkins with sketches and notes.

After frequent visits, Rizal and Bracken fell in love with each other. They applied to marry but, because of Rizal's reputation from his writings and political stance, the local priest Father Obach would only hold the ceremony if Rizal could get permission from the Bishop of Cebu. He was unable to obtain an ecclesiastical marriage because he would not return to Catholicism.Fadul 2008, p. 21. After accompanying her father to Manila on her return to Hong Kong, and before heading back to Dapitan to live with Rizal, Josephine introduced herself to members of Rizal's family in Manila. His mother suggested a civil marriage, which she believed to be a lesser sacrament but less sinful to Rizal's conscience than making any sort of political retraction in order to gain permission from the Bishop.Craig 1914, p. 215. Rizal and Josephine lived as husband and wife in a common-law marriage in Talisay in Dapitan. The couple had a son who lived only for a few hours; Rizal named him after his father Francisco.Fadul 2008, p. 38. In Brussels and Spain (1890‚Äì92) In 1890, Rizal, 29, left Paris for Brussels as he was preparing for the publication of his annotations of Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas (1609). He lived in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters, Catherina and Suzanna, who had a niece Suzanna (\\"Thil\\"), age 16. Historian Gregorio F. Zaide states that Rizal had \\"his romance with Suzanne Jacoby, 45, the petite niece of his landladies.\\" Belgian Pros Slachmuylders, however, believed that Rizal had a romance with the 17-year-old niece, Suzanna Thil, as his other liaisons were all with young women.Cuizon, Ahmed (June 21, 2008). \\"Rizal‚Äôs affair with 'la petite Suzanne'\\" , Inquirer/Cebu Daily, Retrieved on September 20, 2012. He found records clarifying their names and ages. Rizal's Brussels stay was short-lived; he moved to Madrid, giving the young Suzanna a box of chocolates. She wrote to him in French: \\"After your departure, I did not take the chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of your parting. Don‚Äôt delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my shoes for running to the mailbox to see if there is a letter from you. There will never be any home in which you are so loved as in that in Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back‚Ä¶\\" In 2007, Slachmuylders' group arranged for an historical marker honoring Rizal to be placed at the house. He published Dimanche des Rameaux (Palm Sunday), a socio-political essay, in Berlin on 30 November 1886. He discussed the significance of Palm Sunday in socio-political terms: \\"This entry [of Jesus into Jerusalem] decided the fate of the jealous priests, the Pharisees, of all those who believed themselves the only ones who had the right to speak in the name of God, of those who would not admit the truths said by others because they have not been said by them. That triumph, those hosannas, all those flowers, those olive branches, were not for Jesus alone; they were the songs of the victory of the new law, they were the canticles celebrating the dignification of man, the liberty of man, the first mortal blow directed against despotism and slavery\\". Shortly its publication, Rizal was summoned by the German police who suspected him of being a French spy.Ambeth Ocampo, Rizal without the Overcoat (Manila: Anvil Publishing Co., 1990) . Retrieved January 10, 2007. The content of Rizal's writings changed considerably in his two most famous novels, Noli Me T√°ngere, published in Berlin in 1887, and El Filibusterismo, published in Ghent in 1891. For the latter, he used funds borrowed from his friends. These writings angered both the Spanish colonial elite and many educated Filipinos due to their symbolism. They are critical of Spanish friars and the power of the Church. Rizal's friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austria-Hungary-born professor and historian, wrote that the novel's characters were drawn from real life and that every episode can be repeated on any day in the Philippines. Blumentritt was the grandson of the Imperial Treasurer at Vienna in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and a staunch defender of the Catholic faith. This did not dissuade him from writing the preface of El filibusterismo after he had translated Noli Me T√°ngere into German. As Blumentritt had warned, these books resulted in Rizal's being prosecuted as the inciter of revolution. He was eventually tried by the military, convicted and executed. Teaching the natives where they stood brought about an adverse reaction, as the Philippine Revolution of 1896 took off virulently thereafter. Leaders of the reform movement in Spain. Left to right: Rizal, del Pilar, and Ponce (c. 1890). As leader of the reform movement of Filipino students in Spain, Rizal contributed essays, allegories, poems, and editorials to the Spanish newspaper La Solidaridad in Barcelona (in this case Rizal used a pen name, \\"Dimasalang\\", \\"Laong Laan\\" and \\"May Pagasa\\"). The core of his writings centers on liberal and progressive ideas of individual rights and freedom; specifically, rights for the Filipino people. He shared the same sentiments with members of the movement: that the Philippines is battling, in Rizal's own words, \\"a double-faced Goliath\\"‚Äîcorrupt friars and bad government. His commentaries reiterate the following agenda: *That the Philippines be made a province of Spain (The Philippines was a province of New Spain ‚Äì now Mexico, administered from Mexico city from 1565 to 1821. From 1821 to 1898 it was administered directly from Spain.) *Representation in the Cortes *Filipino priests instead of Spanish friars ‚Äì Augustinians, Dominicans, and Franciscans ‚Äì in parishes and remote sitios *Freedom of assembly and speech *Equal rights before the law (for both Filipino and Spanish plaintiffs) The colonial authorities in the Philippines did not favor these reforms. Such Spanish intellectuals as Morayta, Unamuno, Pi y Margall, and others did endorse them. Wenceslao Retana, a political commentator in Spain, had slighted Rizal by writing an insulting article in La Epoca, a newspaper in Madrid. He implied that the family and friends of Rizal were evicted from their lands in Calamba for not having paid their due rents. The incident (when Rizal was ten) stemmed from an accusation that Rizal's mother, Teodora, tried to poison the wife of a cousin, but she said she was trying to help. With the approval of the Church prelates, and without a hearing, she was ordered to prison in Santa Cruz in 1871. She was made to walk the ten miles (16 km) from Calamba. She was released after two-and-a-half years of appeals to the highest court. In 1887, Rizal wrote a petition on behalf of the tenants of Calamba, and later that year led them to speak out against the friars' attempts to raise rent. They initiated a litigation which resulted in the Dominicans' evicting them from their homes, including the Rizal family. General Valeriano Weyler had the buildings on the farm torn down. Upon reading the article, Rizal sent a representative to challenge Retana to a duel. Retana published a public apology and later became one of Rizal's biggest admirers, writing Rizal's most important biography, Vida y Escritos del Jos√© Rizal.Retana, Wenceslao.

Return to Philippines (1892‚Äì96) =Exile in Dapitan= Bust of Padre Guerrico in clay, by Rizal Rizal's pencil sketch of Blumentritt Upon his return to Manila in 1892, he formed a civic movement called La Liga Filipina. The league advocated these moderate social reforms through legal means, but was disbanded by the governor. At that time, he had already been declared an enemy of the state by the Spanish authorities because of the publication of his novel. Rizal was implicated in the activities of the nascent rebellion and in July 1892, was deported to Dapitan in the province of Zamboanga, a peninsula of Mindanao.\\"Appendix II: Decree Banishing Rizal. Governor-General Eulogio Despujol, Manila, July 7, 1892.\\" In Miscellaneous Correspondence of Dr. Jos√© Rizal / translated by Encarnacion Alzona. (Manila: National Historical Institute.) There he built a school, a hospital and a water supply system, and taught and engaged in farming and horticulture. Abaca, then the vital raw material for cordage and which Rizal and his students planted in the thousands, was a memorial. The boys' school, which taught in Spanish, and included English as a foreign language (considered a prescient if unusual option then) was conceived by Rizal and antedated Gordonstoun with its aims of inculcating resourcefulness and self-sufficiency in young men. They would later enjoy successful lives as farmers and honest government officials. One, a Muslim, became a datu, and another, Jos√© Aseniero, who was with Rizal throughout the life of the school, became Governor of Zamboanga. In Dapitan, the Jesuits mounted a great effort to secure his return to the fold led by Fray Francisco de Paula S√°nchez, his former professor, who failed in his mission. The task was resumed by Fray Pastells, a prominent member of the Order. In a letter to Pastells, Rizal sails close to the deism familiar to us today.Raul J.

Those four years of his exile coincided with the development of the Philippine Revolution from inception and to its final breakout, which, from the viewpoint of the court which was to try him, suggested his complicity in it. He condemned the uprising, although all the members of the Katipunan had made him their honorary president and had used his name as a cry for war, unity, and liberty. He is known to making the resolution of bearing personal sacrifice instead of the incoming revolution, believing that a peaceful stand is the best way to avoid further suffering in the country and loss of Filipino lives. In Rizal's own words, \\"I consider myself happy for being able to suffer a little for a cause which I believe to be sacred [...]. I believe further that in any undertaking, the more one suffers for it, the surer its success. If this be fanaticism may God pardon me, but my poor judgment does not see it as such.\\"Rizal, Dapitan, September 1, 1892. In Raul J. Bonoan, The Rizal-Pastells Correspondence. Manila: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1994, 86s. In Dapitan, Rizal wrote \\"Haec Est Sibylla Cumana\\", a parlor-game for his students, with questions and answers for which a wooden top was used. In 2004, Jean Paul Verstraeten traced this book and the wooden top, as well as Rizal's personal watch, spoon and salter. =Arrest and trial= By 1896, the rebellion fomented by the Katipunan, a militant secret society, had become a full-blown revolution, proving to be a nationwide uprising. Rizal had earlier volunteered his services as a doctor in Cuba and was given leave by Governor-General Ram√≥n Blanco to serve in Cuba to minister to victims of yellow fever. Rizal and Josephine left Dapitan on August 1, 1896, with letter of recommendation from Blanco. Rizal was arrested en route to Cuba via Spain and was imprisoned in Barcelona on October 6, 1896. He was sent back the same day to Manila to stand trial as he was implicated in the revolution through his association with members of the Katipunan. During the entire passage, he was unchained, no Spaniard laid a hand on him, and had many opportunities to escape but refused to do so. While imprisoned in Fort Santiago, he issued a manifesto disavowing the current revolution in its present state and declaring that the education of Filipinos and their achievement of a national identity were prerequisites to freedom. Rizal was tried before a court-martial for rebellion, sedition and conspiracy, and was convicted on all three charges and sentenced to death. Blanco, who was sympathetic to Rizal, had been forced out of office. The friars, led by then- Archbishop of Manila Bernardino Nozaleda had 'intercalated' Camilo de Polavieja in his stead as the new Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines after pressuring Queen-Regent Maria Cristina of Spain, thus sealing Rizal's fate. Execution Bagumbayan Moments before his execution on December 30, 1896 by a squad of Filipino soldiers of the Spanish Army, a backup force of regular Spanish Army troops stood ready to shoot the executioners should they fail to obey orders. The Spanish Army Surgeon General requested to take his pulse: it was normal. Aware of this the sergeant commanding the backup force hushed his men to silence when they began raising \\"vivas\\" with the highly partisan crowd of Peninsular and Mestizo Spaniards. His last words were those of Jesus Christ: \\"consummatum est\\" ‚Äì \\"it is finished.\\"Austin Coates, Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr (London: Oxford University Press, 1968) He was secretly buried in Pac√≤ Cemetery in Manila with no identification on his grave. His sister Narcisa toured all possible gravesites and found freshly turned earth at the cemetery with guards posted at the gate. Assuming this could be the most likely spot, there never having been any ground burials, she made a gift to the caretaker to mark the site \\"RPJ\\", Rizal's initials in reverse. His undated poem Mi √∫ltimo adi√≥s, believed to have been written a few days before his execution, was hidden in an alcohol stove, which was later handed to his family with his few remaining possessions, including the final letters and his last bequests.Alvarez, S.V., 1992, Recalling the Revolution, Madison: Center for Southeast Asia Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, During their visit, Rizal reminded his sisters in English, \\"There is something inside it\\", referring to the alcohol stove given by the Pardo de Taveras which was to be returned after his execution, thereby emphasizing the importance of the poem. This instruction was followed by another, \\"Look in my shoes\\", in which another item was secreted. Exhumation of his remains in August 1898, under American rule, revealed that he had been uncoffined, his burial was not on sanctified ground granted to the 'confessed' faithful, and whatever was in his shoes had disintegrated. He is now buried in the Rizal Monument in Manila. In his letter to his family he wrote: \\"Treat our aged parents as you would wish to be treated...Love them greatly in memory of me...December 30, 1896.\\" He gave his family instructions for his burial: \\"Bury me in the ground. Place a stone and a cross over it. My name, the date of my birth and of my death. Nothing more. If later you wish to surround my grave with a fence, you can do it. No anniversaries.\\"\\"Letters Between Rizal and his Family, #223\\". The Life and Writings of Jos√© Rizal. Retrieved on September 29, 2012 In his final letter, to Blumentritt ‚Äì Tomorrow at 7, I shall be shot; but I am innocent of the crime of rebellion. I am going to die with a tranquil conscience. Rizal is believed to be the first Filipino revolutionary whose death is attributed entirely to his work as a writer; and through dissent and civil disobedience enabled him to successfully destroy Spain's moral primacy to rule. He also bequeathed a book personally bound by him in Dapitan to his 'best and dearest friend'. When Blumentritt received it in his hometown of Litomƒõ≈ôice (Leitmeritz), he broke down and wept. Works and writings Rizal wrote mostly in Spanish, the lingua franca of the Spanish East Indies, though some of his letters (for example Sa Mga Kababaihang Taga Malolos) were written in Tagalog. His works have since been translated into a number of languages including Tagalog and English. =Novels and essays= *\\"El amor patrio\\", 1882 essay *\\"Toast to Juan Luna and Felix Hidalgo\\", 1884 speech given at Restaurante Ingles, Madrid *Noli Me T√°ngere, 1887 novel (literally Latin for 'touch me not', from John 20:17) *Alin Mang Lahi (\\"Whate'er the Race\\"), a Kundiman attributed to Dr. Jos√© Rizal *\\"Sa Mga Kababaihang Taga-Malolos\\" (To the Young Women of Malolos), 1889 letter *Annotations to Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, 1889 *\\"Filipinas dentro de cien a√±os\\" (The Philippines a Century Hence), 1889‚Äì90 essay *\\"Sobre la indolencia de los filipinos\\" (The Indolence of Filipinos), 1890 essay *\\"Como se gobiernan las Filipinas\\" (Governing the Philippine islands), 1890 essay *El filibusterismo, 1891 novel; sequel to Noli Me T√°ngere *Una visita del Se√±or a Filipinas, also known as Friars and Filipinos, 14-page unfinished novel written in 1889 *Memorias de un Gallo, 2-page unfinished satire *Makamisa, unfinished Tagalog- language novel written in 1892 The Triumph of Science over Death, by Rizal =Poetry= *\\"Felicitaci√≥n\\" (1874/75) *\\"El embarque\\" (The Embarkation, 1875) *\\"Por la educaci√≥n recibe lustre la patria\\" (1876) *\\"Un recuerdo √° mi pueblo\\" (1876) *\\"Al ni√±o Jes√∫s\\" (c. 1876) *\\"A la juventud filipina\\" (To the Philippine Youth, 1879) *\\"¬°Me piden versos!\\" (1882) *\\"Canto de Mar√≠a Clara\\" (from Noli Me T√°ngere, 1887) *\\"Himno al trabajo\\" (Dalit sa Paggawa, 1888) *\\"Kundiman\\" (disputed, 1889) - also attributed to Pedro Paterno *\\"A mi musa\\" (To My Muse, 1890) *\\"El canto del viajero\\" (1892‚Äì96) *\\"Mi retiro\\" (1895) *\\"Mi √∫ltimo adi√≥s\\" (1896) *\\"Mi primera inspiracion\\" (disputed) - also attributed to Antonio Lopez, Rizal's nephew =Plays= *El Consejo de los Dioses (The Council of Gods) *Junto al Pasig (Along the Pasig)Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons *San Euistaquio, M√°rtyr (Saint Eustache, the martyr) =Other works= Rizal also tried his hand at painting and sculpture. His most famous sculptural work was \\"The Triumph of Science over Death\\", a clay sculpture of a naked young woman with overflowing hair, standing on a skull while bearing a torch held high. The woman symbolized the ignorance of humankind during the Dark Ages, while the torch she bore symbolized the enlightenment science brings over the whole world. He sent the sculpture as a gift to his dear friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, together with another one named \\"The Triumph of Death over Life\\". The woman is shown trampling the skull, a symbol of death, to signify the victory the humankind achieved by conquering the bane of death through their scientific advancements. The original sculpture is now displayed at the Rizal Shrine Museum at Fort Santiago in Intramuros, Manila. A large replica, made of concrete, stands in front of Fernando Calder√≥n Hall, the building which houses the College of Medicine of the University of the Philippines Manila along Pedro Gil Street in Ermita, Manila. Reactions after death An engraving of the execution of Filipino insurgents at Bagumbayan (now Luneta) Historical marker of Jos√© Rizal's execution site =Retraction controversy= Several historians report that Rizal retracted his anti-Catholic ideas through a document which stated: \\"I retract with all my heart whatever in my words, writings, publications and conduct have been contrary to my character as a son of the Catholic Church.\\" However, there are doubts of its authenticity given that there is no certificate of Rizal's Catholic marriage to Josephine Bracken.Ricardo Roque Pascual, Jos√© Rizal Beyond the Grave (Manila: P. Ayuda & Co., 1962) Also there is an allegation that the retraction document was a forgery.Ildefonso T. Runes and Mameto R. Buenafe, The Forgery of the Rizal \\"Retraction\\" and Josephine's \\"Autobiography\\" (Manila: BR Book Col, 1962). After analyzing six major documents of Rizal, Ricardo Pascual concluded that the retraction document, said to have been discovered in 1935, was not in Rizal's handwriting. Senator Rafael Palma, a former President of the University of the Philippines and a prominent Mason, argued that a retraction is not in keeping with Rizal's character and mature beliefs. He called the retraction story a \\"pious fraud.\\"Rafael Palma, Pride of the Malay Race (New York: Prentice Hall, 1949) Others who deny the retraction are Frank Laubach, a Protestant minister; Austin Coates, a British writer; and Ricardo Manapat, director of the National Archives. Those who affirm the authenticity of Rizal's retraction are prominent Philippine historians such as Nick Joaquin, Nicolas Zafra of UP Le√≥n Mar√≠a Guerrero III, Gregorio Zaide, Guillermo G√≥mez Rivera, Ambeth Ocampo, John Schumacher,Schumacher, John. \\"The Making of a Nation: Essays on Nineteenth-Century Nationalism\\". Antonio Molina,Molina, Antonio M. (1998). \\"Yo, Jos√© Rizal\\". Ediciones de Cultura Hisp√°nica, Madrid. Paul Dumol\\"Uncovering Controversial Facts about Jos√© Rizal\\" (mariaronabeltran.com) and Austin Craig. They take the retraction document as authentic, having been judged as such by a foremost expert on the writings of Rizal, Teodoro Kalaw (a 33rd degree Mason) and \\"handwriting experts...known and recognized in our courts of justice\\", H. Otley Beyer and Dr. Jos√© I. Del Rosario, both of UP. Historians also refer to 11 eyewitnesses when Rizal wrote his retraction, signed a Catholic prayer book, and recited Catholic prayers, and the multitude who saw him kiss the crucifix before his execution. A great grand nephew of Rizal, Fr. Marciano Guzman, cites that Rizal's 4 confessions were certified by 5 eyewitnesses, 10 qualified witnesses, 7 newspapers, and 12 historians and writers including Aglipayan bishops, Masons and anti-clericals. One witness was the head of the Spanish Supreme Court at the time of his notarized declaration and was highly esteemed by Rizal for his integrity. Because of what he sees as the strength these direct evidence have in the light of the historical method, in contrast with merely circumstantial evidence, UP professor emeritus of history Nicolas Zafra called the retraction \\"a plain unadorned fact of history.\\" Guzm√°n attributes the denial of retraction to \\"the blatant disbelief and stubbornness\\" of some Masons. To explain the retraction Guzman said that the factors are the long discussion and debate which appealed to reason and logic that he had with Fr. Balaguer, the visits of his mentors and friends from the Ateneo, and the grace of God due the numerous prayers of religious communities. Supporters see in the retraction Rizal's \\"moral courage...to recognize his mistakes,\\" his reversion to the \\"true faith\\", and thus his \\"unfading glory,\\" and a return to the \\"ideals of his fathers\\" which \\"did not diminish his stature as a great patriot; on the contrary, it increased that stature to greatness.\\"(1950-01-06). \\"Joint Statement of the Catholic Hierarchy of the Philippines on the Book 'The Pride of the Malay Race'\\".

On the other hand, senator Jose Diokno stated, \\"Surely whether Rizal died as a Catholic or an apostate adds or detracts nothing from his greatness as a Filipino... Catholic or Mason, Rizal is still Rizal ‚Äì the hero who courted death 'to prove to those who deny our patriotism that we know how to die for our duty and our beliefs'.\\"Garcia, Ricardo P. (1964). \\"The Great Debate: The Rizal Retraction ‚Äì Preface\\". R.P. Garcia Publishing Co., Quezon City. =\\"Mi √∫ltimo adi√≥s\\"= The poem is more aptly titled \\"Adi√≥s, Patria Adorada\\" (literally \\"Farewell, Beloved Fatherland\\"), by virtue of logic and literary tradition, the words coming from the first line of the poem itself. It first appeared in print not in Manila but in Hong Kong in 1897, when a copy of the poem and an accompanying photograph came to J. P. Braga who decided to publish it in a monthly journal he edited. There was a delay when Braga, who greatly admired Rizal, wanted a good facsimile of the photograph and sent it to be engraved in London, a process taking well over two months. It finally appeared under \\"Mi √∫ltimo pensamiento,\\" a title he supplied and by which it was known for a few years. Thus, the Jesuit Balaguer's anonymous account of the retraction and the marriage to Josephine was published in Barcelona before word of the poem's existence had reached him and he could revise what he had written. His account was too elaborate for Rizal to have had time to write \\"Adi√≥s.\\" Six years after his death, when the Philippine Organic Act of 1902 was being debated in the United States Congress, Representative Henry Cooper of Wisconsin rendered an English translation of Rizal's valedictory poem capped by the peroration, \\"Under what clime or what skies has tyranny claimed a nobler victim?\\"Esteban de Ocampo, \\"Why is Rizal the Greatest Filipino Hero?\\" National Historical Institute. Subsequently, the US Congress passed the bill into law, which is now known as the Philippine Organic Act of 1902. This was a major breakthrough for a U.S. Congress that had yet to grant the equal rights to African Americans guaranteed to them in the U.S. Constitution and at a time the Chinese Exclusion Act was still in effect. It created the Philippine legislature, appointed two Filipino delegates to the U.S. Congress, extended the U.S. Bill of Rights to Filipinos and laid the foundation for an autonomous government. The colony was on its way to independence. The United States passed the Jones Law that made the legislature fully autonomous until 1916 but did not recognize Philippine independence until the Treaty of Manila in 1946‚Äîfifty years after Rizal's death. This same poem, which has inspired independence activists across the region and beyond, was recited (in its Indonesian translation by Rosihan Anwar) by Indonesian soldiers of independence before going into battle. =Later life of Bracken= Josephine Bracken, whom Rizal addressed as his wife on his last day,Craig 1914, p. 241. promptly joined the revolutionary forces in Cavite province, making her way through thicket and mud across enemy lines, and helped reloading spent cartridges at the arsenal in Imus under the revolutionary General Pantale√≥n Garc√≠a. Imus came under threat of recapture that the operation was moved, with Bracken, to Maragondon, the mountain redoubt in Cavite.Fadul 2008, p. 18. She witnessed the Tejeros Convention prior to returning to Manila and was summoned by the Governor-General, but owing to her stepfather's American citizenship she could not be forcibly deported. She left voluntarily returning to Hong Kong. She later married another Filipino, Vicente Abad, a mestizo acting as agent for the Tabacalera firm in the Philippines. She died of tuberculosis in Hong Kong on March 15, 1902, and was buried at the Happy Valley Cemetery. She was immortalized by Rizal in the last stanza of Mi Ultimo Adios: \\"Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend, my joy...\\". =Polavieja and Blanco= Polavieja faced condemnation by his countrymen after his return to Spain. While visiting Girona, in Catalonia, circulars were distributed among the crowd bearing Rizal's last verses, his portrait, and the charge that Polavieja was responsible for the loss of the Philippines to Spain.Craig 1914, pp. 259‚Äì260. Ramon Blanco later presented his sash and sword to the Rizal family as an apology. Criticism and controversies Attempts to debunk legends surrounding Rizal, and the tug of war between free thinker and Catholic, have kept his legacy controversial. Rizal Shrine in Calamba City, Laguna, the ancestral house and birthplace of Jos√© Rizal, is now a museum housing Rizal memorabilia. Jos√© Rizal's original grave at Paco Park in Manila. Slightly renovated and date repainted in English. =National hero status= The confusion over Rizal's real stance on the Philippine Revolution leads to the sometimes bitter question of his ranking as the nation's premier hero. But then again, according to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza, and Filipino historian Ambeth Ocampo, there is no Filipino historical figure, including Rizal, that was officially declared as national hero through law or executive order. Although, there were laws and proclamations honoring Filipino heroes. Made national hero by colonial Americans Some suggest that Jose Rizal was made a legislated national hero by the American forces occupying the Philippines. In 1901, the American Governor General William Howard Taft suggested that the U.S. sponsored Philippine Commission name Rizal a national hero for Filipinos. Jose Rizal was an ideal candidate, favourable to the American occupiers since he was dead, and non-violent, a favourable quality which, if emulated by Filipinos, would not threaten the American rule or change the status quo of the occupiers of the Philippine islands. Rizal did not advocate independence for the Philippines either. Subsequently, the US-sponsored commission passed Act No. 346 which set the anniversary of Rizal's death as a ‚Äúday of observance.‚Äù Renato Constantino writes Rizal is a \\"United States-sponsored hero\\" who was promoted as the greatest Filipino hero during the American colonial period of the Philippines ‚Äì after Aguinaldo lost the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The United States promoted Rizal, who represented peaceful political advocacy (in fact, repudiation of violent means in general) instead of more radical figures whose ideas could inspire resistance against American rule. Rizal was selected over Andr√©s Bonifacio who was viewed \\"too radical\\" and Apolinario Mabini who was considered \\"unregenerate.\\"Constantino, Renato (1980) [1970], \\"Veneration without Understanding, Dissent and Counter- consciousness\\", pp. 125‚Äì145. Malaya Books, Quezon City . Made national hero by Emilio Aguinaldo On the other hand, numerous sources quote that it was General Emilio Aguinaldo, and not the second Philippine Commission, who first recognized December 30 as \\"national day of mourning in memory of Rizal and other victims of Spanish tyranny. As per them, the first celebration of Rizal Day was held in Manila on December 30, 1898, under the sponsorship of the Club Filipino. The veracity of both claims seems to be justified and hence difficult to ascertain. However, most historians agree that a majority of Filipinos were unaware of Rizal during his lifetime, as he was a member of the richer elite classes (he was born in an affluent family, had lived abroad for nearly as long as he had lived in the Philippines) and wrote primarily in an elite language (at that time, Tagalog and Cebuano were the languages of the masses) about ideals as lofty as freedom (the masses were more concerned about day to day issues like earning money and making a living, something which has not changed much today). Teodoro Agoncillo opines that the Philippine national hero, unlike those of other countries, is not \\"the leader of its liberation forces\\". He gives the opinion that Andr√©s Bonifacio not replace Rizal as national hero, like some have suggested, but that be honored alongside him.Agoncillo, Teodoro (1990) [1960], \\"History of the Filipino People (8th ed.)\\".

Retrieved on September 29, 2012. The historian Rafael Palma, contends that the revolution of Bonifacio is a consequence wrought by the writings of Rizal and that although the Bonifacio's revolver produced an immediate outcome, the pen of Rizal generated a more lasting achievement.Rafael Palma (1949). \\"Pride of the Malay Race\\", p. 367. Prentice Hall, New York. =Critiques of books= Others present him as a man of contradictions. Miguel de Unamuno in \\"Rizal: the Tagalog Hamlet\\", said of him, ‚Äúa soul that dreads the revolution although deep down desires it. He pivots between fear and hope, between faith and despair.‚ÄùMiguel de Unamuno, \\"The Tagalog Hamlet\\" in Rizal: Contrary Essays, edited by D. Feria and P. Daroy (Manila: National Book Store, 1968). His critics assert this character flaw is translated into his two novels where he opposes violence in Noli and appears to advocate it in Fili, contrasting Ibarra's idealism to Simoun's cynicism. His defenders insist this ambivalence is trounced when Simoun is struck down in the sequel's final chapters, reaffirming the author's resolute stance, Pure and spotless must the victim be if the sacrifice is to be acceptable.Jos√© Rizal, El Filibusterismo (Ghent: 1891) chap.39, translated by Andrea Tablan and Salud Enriquez (Manila: Marian Publishing House, 2001) . (online text at Project Gutenberg) Many thinkers tend to find the characters of Mar√≠a Clara and Ibarra (Noli Me T√°ngere) poor role models, Mar√≠a Clara being too frail, and young Ibarra being too accepting of circumstances, rather than being courageous and bold. In El Filibusterismo, Rizal had Father Florentino say: ‚Äú...our liberty will (not) be secured at the sword's point...we must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it. And when a people reaches that height God will provide a weapon, the idols will be shattered, tyranny will crumble like a house of cards and liberty will shine out like the first dawn.‚Äù Rizal's attitude to the Philippine Revolution is also debated, not only based on his own writings, but also due to the varying eyewitness accounts of P√≠o Valenzuela, a doctor who in 1895 had consulted Rizal in Dapitan on behalf of Bonifacio and the Katipunan. =Role in the Philippine revolution= Upon the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896, Valenzuela surrendered to the Spanish authorities and testified in military court that Rizal had strongly condemned an armed struggle for independence when Valenzuela asked for his support. Rizal had even refused him entry to his house. Bonifacio, in turn, had openly denounced him as a coward for his refusal. However, years later, Valenzuela testified that Rizal had been favorable to an uprising as long as the Filipinos were well-prepared, and well-supplied with arms. Rizal had suggested that the Katipunan get wealthy and influential Filipino members of society on their side, or at least ensure they would stay neutral. Rizal had even suggested his friend Antonio Luna to lead the revolutionary forces since he had studied military science. In the event that the Katipunan was discovered prematurely, they should fight rather than allow themselves to be killed. Valenzuela said to historian Teodoro Agoncillo that he had lied to the Spanish military authorities about Rizal's true stance toward a revolution in an attempt to exculpate him.Agoncillo, Teodoro. The Revolt of the Masses. Before his execution, Rizal wrote a proclamation denouncing the revolution. But as noted by historian Floro Quibuyen, his final poem Mi ultimo adios contains a stanza which equates his coming execution and the rebels then dying in battle as fundamentally the same, as both are dying for their country.Quibuyen, A Nation Aborted: Rizal, American Hegemony, And Philippine Nationalism Legacy and remembrance Rizal was a contemporary of Gandhi, Tagore and Sun Yat Sen who also advocated liberty through peaceful means rather than by violent revolution. Coinciding with the appearance of those other leaders, Rizal from an early age had been enunciating in poems, tracts and plays, ideas all his own of modern nationhood as a practical possibility in Asia. In the Noli he stated that if European civilization had nothing better to offer, colonialism in Asia was doomed. Government poster from the 1950s Though popularly mentioned, especially on blogs, there is no evidence to suggest that Gandhi or Nehru may have corresponded with Rizal, neither have they mentioned him in any of their memoirs or letters. But it was documented by Rizal's biographer, Austin Coates who interviewed Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi that Rizal was mentioned, specifically in Nehru's prison letters to his daughter Indira. As a political figure, Jos√© Rizal was the founder of La Liga Filipina, a civic organization that subsequently gave birth to the Katipunan led by Andr√©s Bonifacio,, a secret society which would start the Philippine Revolution against Spain that eventually laid the foundation of the First Philippine Republic under Emilio Aguinaldo. He was a proponent of achieving Philippine self-government peacefully through institutional reform rather than through violent revolution, and would only support \\"violent means\\" as a last resort. Rizal believed that the only justification for national liberation and self- government was the restoration of the dignity of the people, saying \\"Why independence, if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow?\\" However, through careful examination of his works and statements, including Mi Ultimo Adios, Rizal reveals himself as a revolutionary. His image as the Tagalog Christ also intensified early reverence to him. Rizal, through his reading of Morga and other western historians, knew of the genial image of Spain's early relations with his people.Jos√© Rizal, \\"Indolence of the Filipino\\". Retrieved on January 10, 2007. In his writings, he showed the disparity between the early colonialists and those of his day, with the latter's injustices giving rise to Gomburza and the Philippine Revolution of 1896. The English biographer, Austin Coates, and writer, Benedict Anderson, believe that Rizal gave the Philippine revolution a genuinely national character; and that Rizal's patriotism and his standing as one of Asia's first intellectuals have inspired others of the importance of a national identity to nation-building. The Belgian researcher Jean Paul \\"JP\\" Verstraeten authored several books about Jose Rizal: Rizal in Belgium and France, Jose Rizal's Europe, Growing up like Rizal (published by the National Historical Institute and in teacher's programs all over the Philippines), Reminiscences and Travels of Jose Rizal and Jose Rizal \\"Pearl of Unselfishness\\".

He then able to collect a number of species of various classes: insects, butterflies, amphibians, reptiles, shells, snakes and plants. Rizal sent many specimens of animals, insects, and plants for identification to the (Anthropological and Ethnographical Museum of Dresden), Dresden Museum of Ethnology. It was not in his interest to receive any monetary payment; all he wanted were scientific books, magazines and surgical instruments which he needed and used in Dapitan. During his exile, Rizal also secretly sent several specimens of flying dragons to Europe. He believed that they were a new species. The German zoologist Benno Wandolleck named them Draco rizali after Rizal. However, it has since been discovered that the species had already been described by the Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1885 as Draco guentheri. There are three species named after Rizal: *Draco rizali ‚Äì a small lizard, known as a flying dragon *Apogania rizali ‚Äì a very rare kind of beetle with five horns *Rhacophorus rizali ‚Äì a peculiar frog species.

In the 10th FAMAS Awards, he was honored in the Best Story category for Gerardo de Le√≥n's adaptation of his book Noli Me T√°ngere. The recognition was repeated the following year with his movie version of El Filibusterismo, making him the only person to win back-to-back FAMAS Awards posthumously. Both novels were translated into opera by the composer-librettist Felipe Padilla de Le√≥n: Noli me tangere in 1957 and El filibusterismo in 1970; and his 1939 overture, Mariang Makiling, was inspired by Rizal's tale of the same name. Ang Luha at Lualhati ni Jeronima is a film inspired by the third chapter of Rizal's El filibusterismo. =Biographical films/TV series= *Portrayed by Eddie del Mar in the 1956 film, Ang Buhay at Pag-ibig ni Dr. Jose Rizal *Portrayed by Albert Martinez in the 1997 film, Rizal sa Dapitan *Portrayed by Dominic Guinto and Cesar Montano in the 1998 biographical film, Jos√© Rizal *Portrayed by Joel Torre in the 1999 mockumentary film, Bayaning 3rd World *Portrayed by Nasser in the 2013 TV series, Katipunan *Portrayed by Jhiz Deocareza and Alden Richards in the 2014 TV series, Ilustrado. *Portrayed by Jericho Rosales in the 2014 film, Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo *Portrayed by Tony Labrusca in the 2019 iWant original series, Ang Babae sa Septic Tank 3: The Untold Story of Josephine Bracken =Other= *Rizal appeared in the 1999 video game Medal of Honor as a secret character in multiplayer, alongside other historical figures such as William Shakespeare and Winston Churchill.

They are partly who migrated to India and their descendants and mostly refugees from Sri Lanka because of the concluded Sri Lankan Civil War. In general socio economically they are living below poverty line, except few people who settled in India during early times, rich businessmen, and professionals. In Tamil Nadu they are also known as Ceylon Tamils or Jaffna Tamils. History =Early arrivals= During 19th century and early 20th century some Sri Lankan Tamils especially from Jaffna migrated or settled in India for various reasons such as education, employment in the British Indian government, business and other reasons. Among them were Hensman family, who migrated to Chennai from Jaffna during late 19th century. =1960s= In 1948, immediately after the country's independence, a controversial law labelled the Ceylon Citizenship Act was passed in the Sri Lankan parliament which deliberately discriminated against the Tamils of South Indian origin, whose ancestors had settled in the country in the 19th and 20th centuries. This act made it virtually impossible for them to obtain citizenship and over 700,000 Tamils (consisting of up to 11% of the country's total population) were made stateless. In 1964, a pact was signed between Bandaranaike and the then Indian Prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri to repatriate much of the population of the stateless Tamils. Over the next 30 years, successive Sri Lankan governments were actively engaged in deporting over 300,000 Tamils back to India. It wasn't until 2003, after a state- sponsored pogrom against Tamils and a full-scale civil war, that Indian Tamils were granted citizenship but by this time, their population had dwindled to just 5% of the country's population. Tamils repatriated to India were assimilated with location population after taking Indian Citizenships, except a few pockets in Tamil Nadu, where they are still called as Ceylon Tamils. Most of the Tamils, who were repatriated, settled in various parts of Tamil Nadu, while a few hundred families have settled in Punalur taluk of Kollam district in Kerala, and in Sulya and Puttur taluks of Dakshina Kannada district in Karnataka where a majority of them work in tea and rubber plantations. =1980s= Following the events of the Black July riots, and later the outbreak of the Sri Lankan Civil War, tens of thousands Sri Lankan Tamil refugees arrived in Tamil Nadu in four waves. The first wave on 24 July 1983, after Black July, to the 29 July 1987 up until the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, 134,053 Sri Lankan Tamils arrived in India. The first repatriation took place after the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987 and between 24 December 1987 and 31 August 1989, 25,585 refugees and non-camp Sri Lankan nationals returned to Sri Lanka. The second wave began with the start of Eelam War II after 25 August 1989, where 122,000 Sri Lankan Tamils came to Tamil Nadu. On 20 January 1992, after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi 54,188 refugees were voluntarily repatriated to Sri Lanka, until March 1995. Eelam War III commenced in April 1995 starting the third wave or refugees. By 12 April 2002, nearly 23,356 refugees had come to Tamil Nadu. The flow of refugees had stopped in 2002 because of the cease fire agreement. Demographics Tamils distribution in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka Sri Lankan Tamils in India number in the hundreds of thousands, mostly in the state of Tamil Nadu, the closest state to Sri Lanka and the easiest to get to. There is also a considerable amount in the state of Kerala with around 700 refugee families. There are also a number of Sri Lankan Tamils in the eastern regions of Orissa, Karnataka and Pondicherry. Highest number of Sri Lankan Tamil families living in KK Nagar, Thuvakudi in Trichirapalli, Neelankarai, Valasaravakkam in Chennai, Nagercoil in Kanniyakumari, R.S puram, Valparai in Coimbatore. Refugees The Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in Tamil Nadu have three different kinds of shelter. The first is the camp refugees or those who took shelter in camps mostly located in the rural areas. They were sent from the Mandapam transit camp to different locations. The second group is non-camp refugees are those living in tented house with relatives and friends without any assistance from the government. Nearly fifty thousand refugees lived outside camps; most of them are staying in big cities. The third group consisted of those who supposedly posed security threats since they were involved in subversive activities in Sri Lanka. They were sent to special camps where they had to live under constant surveillance. These special camps came into existence in 1991. =The camps= Rajapalayam refugee camp Vembakkottai village, Virudhunagar When the first wave of refugees entered India in 1983, they were divided into three groups. Besides the camp and non- camp refugees, there were the militants in special camps. The Government of Tamil Nadu had to welcome the refugees in the emergency situation. The Indian government did not like to send the refugees to other states because of the language barriers. India's continued refusal to sign protocols and also the ban on NGOs prevent any international help from reaching the refugees. There are nearly 80,000 refugees 132 camps in Tamil Nadu and one in Orissa. All refugee camps are registered. This entitles them to government assistance- cash, shelter, health facilities, clothing and provision of essential items. The refugees from Sri Lanka have been the recipients of one of the most advanced systems of education in the world, but since 1991, this privilege has been withdrawn. Refugees also have strict restrictions on their freedom of movement and are treated with some degree of suspicion by the Indian government. It is due to the assassination of former Indian Prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 by a suspected member of the LTTE. After that some refugee camps were moved away from coastal areas to isolated interior regions of Tamil Nadu state so as to prevent contact amongst the refugees belonging to different camps. Refugees also have strict restrictions on their freedom of movement and are treated as third grade citizens. If anyone disobeys the rules, they may have their monthly stipend and rations cut off as punishment. As India has not signed the international convention for refugees, the plight of the Sri Lankan refugees in India is not brought to the scrutiny of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and no other major human rights organisation has taken note of the suffering of the Tamils languishing in the \\"special camps\\" in India. Militant refugees Militant leadership has always been elitist and there is a clear line of distinction between them and the mass of refugees. The leadership drew its support and recruited its forces from the refugee camps. These camps no longer exist. They were all dosed down after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, but their legacy continues to haunt the refugees. Non-camp refugees These are the refugees who do not receive financial assistance from the government. They are mostly rich businessmen and professionals. Most of the Sri Lankan Tamils lives in the pockets of Chennai, Trichy and Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, Trivandrum, Punalur in Kerala. Recent developments Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Mr.M.Karunanidhi assured that the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in and outside the camps would be granted Indian citizenship soon. Spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has backed Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi‚Äôs call to give Indian citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India. Prominent people * V.

Jean Calvin addressed on this occasion a letter to Roussel, mostly condemnatory, in which he said : Calling to mind the \\"former piety\\" of Roussel, \\"which I [Calvin] formerly admired, and which was for me an example of extreme worth\\", he called Roussel Calvin ended his letter with a condemnation of Roussel's new position : The former Oloron Cathedral, now St Mary's Church. G√©rard Roussel did not cease to be bishop of Oloron ; however, he served as advisor to Marguerite of Navarre and then to her husband, king Henry II of Navarre. On his advice, measures quite similar to some aspects of the Protestant Reformation were introduced, such as preaching in vernacular rather than Latin, but without formally breaking away from catholicism. In much the same spirit, and to establish a reference for the priests of the kingdom of Navarre, he wrote the Familiar Exposition of the Creed, of the Law and of the Sunday Prayer (Famili√®re exposition du symbole, de la loi et de l'oraison dominicale) in which he explained these fundamental texts in a light that could be seen as Protestant, especially close to the idea of justification by faith; it should however be noted that this trend of interpretation existed within Christianity before the Protestant Reformation, and was still held by some Catholic bishops and theologians. Furthermore, Farel did not attack, nor did he defend, the Catholic Church. However, such a stance was by now suspect at best, and in 1550 the Sorbonne, at that time Paris' university of theology and a major orthodoxy watchdog in the kingdom of France, condemned Roussel's work as \\"pernicious for Christiendom [...] reeking of heresy and in part obviously heretic\\". Thus, condemned by representatives of both the catholic orthodoxy and the calvinist orthodoxy, Roussel indeed illustrated these men \\"between Rome and Geneva\\" studied by Thierry Wanegffelen. He died in the same year 1550. He had a brother, Antoine Roussel.

It received its UK cinema release in 2010. Directed and produced by David L. Williams Beyond the Pole was shot on floating sea ice off the coast of Greenland, and stars an acclaimed cast of actors and comedians including: Stephen Mangan, Rhys Thomas, Mark Benton, Alexander Skarsgard and Helen Baxendale. Described by Variety magazine as a cross between The Office and Touching the Void, the film follows the trials and tribulations of the world's first Carbon Neutral, Vegetarian, Organic expedition to the North Pole. Plot Uptight Mark (Mangan) and his good natured friend and follower Brian (Thomas) hope to save the planet from global warming (and maybe get into the Guinness Book of Records) by setting out on the world's first Carbon Neutral, Vegetarian, Organic expedition to the North Pole. Unfortunately they have no experience whatsoever and after shooting their cameraman after a misunderstanding, soon find themselves in a life and death race against a cocky gay (and Olympic) Norwegian team led by Alexander Skarsg√•rd. Providing logistical support from the UK HQ (a caravan on a hill with big aerials) are Brian's wife, Sandra, and Mark's second best friend, Graham, a keen CB radio enthusiast. The documentary director, played by Helen Baxendale, does her best to make sure no one actually dies during the making of the documentary, but is way out of her depth.

Margarete Dessoff established the organization in 1930 as the union of two choirs she directed, the Adesdi chorus and the A Cappella Singers, whence the plural Choirs. Today, the plural connotes Dessoff's various ensembles, which range from the large Dessoff Symphonic Choir, which appears with major orchestras, to the smaller Dessoff Chamber Choir, which performs in more intimate settings.From http://www.dessoff.org The performance of new, unusual, or rarely heard works is a central facet of Dessoff's mission. Under Mme. Dessoff's baton, the Dessoff Choirs gave many premieres, including the American premiere of Arnold Sch√∂nberg's Friede auf Erden, the first American performance of Orazio Vecchi's L'Amfiparnaso, and the New York premiere of Bach's cantata Christ Lag in Todesbanden. Dessoff's second conductor, Paul Boepple, continued to champion early music, and when he retired after 32 years as musical director, early music had seen its modern renaissance, one in which Dessoff had played a significant role. In 1951, the Dessoff Choirs performed with the New York Wind Ensemble at a special Peabody Mason Concert series commemorating the Paris Bi-Millennial year.Boston Herald, 16-May-1951, Rudolph Elie, \\"Fanny Mason Concert\\" During Mr. Boepple's tenure, the Choirs released 13 recordings, and his editions were published by Theodore Presser as the Dessoff Choir Series. Recent history From 2005 through 2010, James Bagwell served as the musical director of Dessoff. Under his direction, Dessoff performed several large works not often heard, including Kurt Weill's Berliner Requiem, Paul Hindemith's Apparebit repentina dies, and William Bolcom's The Mask. In addition, Mr. Bagwell expanded Dessoff's repertoire with regard to American music, including in the choir's concerts Sacred Harp music and American music from the 18th and 21st centuries. Dessoff's May, 2009, concert, which included works by Charles Ives and his teacher Horatio Parker, was recorded live and released on CD and by mp3 download in December, 2009. In September, 2009, Mr. Bagwell was named musical director of the Collegiate Chorale. In June, 2009, the Dessoff Symphonic Choir joined the New York Philharmonic and the New York Choral Artists for seven performances of two programs (Britten's War Requiem and Mahler's Symphony No. 8) marking Lorin Maazel's final concerts as music director of the Philharmonic. Coincidentally, Dessoff also shared the stage at these concerts with its previous music director, Kent Tritle, the Philharmonic's organist. In November, 2009, the Dessoff Chamber Choir performed songs from The Kinks Choral Collection with Ray Davies on the Late Show with David Letterman and at two Town Hall performances. In May 2010, Christopher Shepard became the seventh music director of The Dessoff Choirs.

It services UWSP students, faculty, and citizens of the city. Background The UWSP LRC was built in 1970, and an addition to the building was built in 1986, which increased the usable square feet from 60,000 to 133,000. The library's lobby was remodeled in 2002 and there have been multiple changes throughout the library since that time. In 2002 the last renovation was completed to the library, in which the Museum of Natural History was expanded, the reference room was remodeled, a staircase was built between the first and second floor, and a new classroom was added. In 2006 the Food for Thought Caf√© was added to the after hours area on the first floor. The UWSP LRC provides many services to students and public patrons, including: Tutoring and Learning Center, Center for Academic Excellence and Student Engagement, Assistive Technology, Wisconsin Center for Environmental Education (WCEE), Peace Institute, Food for Thought Caf√©, Natural History Museum and selected IT (Information Technology) services. The LRC has a diverse collection, which includes, but is not limited to: books, journals, archives, special collections, government documents, reference materials, media, manuscripts, realia, microfilm/fiche, scores, and maps. The library currently houses a collection of 2,014,546 titles and volumes. This collection can be found among the six above ground floors. The library is open 104 hours a week during the fall and spring semesters, and has extensive library hours for the summer. The library is also a depository for government documents, both state and national. For a virtual tour of the library, visit the following webpage: UWSP LRC Virtual Tour =City= The UWSP LRC is located in the city of Stevens Point. Stevens Point is located in central Wisconsin, in Portage County, midway between Milwaukee and Minneapolis; on the Wisconsin River. This city has a population of 25,000, with a surrounding area population of 62,000. The city covers 16.8 square miles. Stevens Point is frequently ranked in ‚ÄúThe Top 100 Places to Live‚Äù by Relocate America. =University= The University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point is a four-year public university that is part of the UW system. UWSP was founded in 1894 as a Teacher's College and now has over 48 majors and 78 minors for undergraduates. UWSP has 12 graduate programs and one doctorate program, in cooperation with The University of Wisconsin, Madison. UWSP employs over 400 faculty and teaching academic and staff. The student to faculty ratio is 22:1. Governance The UWSP LRC's Mission ties into the mission and governance of its university and the state university system. The University of Wisconsin System Mission is as follows: The following values are listed as being core to UWSP's mission: *Student-centered environment *Critical thinking, creativity, and lifelong learning *Professional preparation *Community involvement and outreach *Ecological stewardship The LRC's Mission ties into these mission statements: This mission statement was written in 1987 and is still used today. UWSP's mission and the mission of the UW System is all about providing a liberal education and preparing students for a changing world through education and research. The library's mission statement is to \\"enhance\\" these two missions with the help of the library's resources and faculty. The three mission statements merge, each with their own goals, but each enhancing the other. Their common goal is always the student. =Staff organizational structure= This organizational chart shows all librarians as having equal status and equal power. The organization chart has a \\"flat structure\\" and all librarians who are not classified or academic staff have faculty status. Faculty librarians in the LRC have to have both an MLS master's degree and a subject area master's degree to be considered for tenure. Despite the flat structure of the organization chart, it does show certain classes of librarians. At the top of the chart is the director and underneath is the faculty. Beneath the faculty are the academic staff followed by the classified staff and then the limited term employees. Academic staff, however, have no status over classified staff. Classified staff and academic staff are all supervised by the faculty in one form or another. Strategic planning Strategic planning is important to not only evaluate the current state of the library and find its strengths and weaknesses, but to build on what the library has and develop new goals for the future. More information can be gathered through here: UWSP LRC Strategic Planning Kathy Davis (current library director), is the head of strategic planning for the UWSP LRC. However, many librarians from various departments are also listed on the strategic planning documents as aiding in the planning and being a part of the strategic planning committee. The areas that the strategic planning focuses on are: *Technology *Collections *Outreach/Collaboration *Facilities *Services *Assessment *Library Leadership/Organization: The first item on the library's time line is the Environmental Scan. The environmental scan focuses on all of the areas the strategic plan focuses on. The environmental scan will evaluate and survey these areas and give those who are creating the strategic plan a place to start. The environmental scan can find areas that the library is lacking in or areas that should be focused on in the strategic planning. Self studies also function in this manner, but are more detailed and provide an outside look into the library. In the past two years, the LRC did a self study to find the library's strengths and weaknesses so that information could be applied to the strategic planning. An outside group of library directors came in and contributed their expert evaluations of the study done by the librarians and library staff. Their comments and recommendations were used to help shape the strategic planning. The goals of the strategic planning are as follows: *Develop, advance and support innovative collection development initiatives and strategies. *Create a dynamic service culture responsive to the changing needs of our users. *Improve access to information resources through the creative use of technology. *Encourage and facilitate lifelong learning through the development of instructional programs and services that emphasize problem solving, critical thinking, and investigative skills. *Foster engagement and collaboration with partners from the campus, the UW System, the local community and beyond. *Create a forward thinking, dynamic organization that is responsive and flexible. *Enhance the library space, based upon users‚Äô needs, to be the hub of learning and scholarship on campus. *Improve the library's effectiveness through systematic, ongoing outcome-based assessment. Fiscal planning and budget The total university budget equals $119,389,089, with $2,471,900 going to the LRC's budget: =Diversity= The LRC receives diversity training through the university's Equity and Affirmative Action Office (EAA). Currently, Mai Vang, Assistant to the chancellor, runs this office. =EOA= The LRC is an equal opportunity employer. Collection development Every year, each academic department on campus has assigned funds for purchasing books. A faculty librarian is a liaison between the departments and the library. Each faculty librarian assists the department in picking out and purchasing books for the year. The librarians will usually work with a department they're familiar with or a subject they studied (grad or undergrad) in college. There are some general guidelines for the development of the LRC's collection: *Appropriateness for the undergraduate and/or graduate programs at the University of Wisconsin- Stevens Point as stated in the missions statement. Materials that go beyond the academic curricula but meet the cultural, career, recreational and information needs of the campus community are also given consideration. *Possibility of use for one or more courses. *Building on identified strength of the existing collection in a particular subject area. *Filling identified gaps or weaknesses in the existing collection. *Permanence of the material. *Currency and timeliness of the material. *Expected usage: for occasional needs, interlibrary loan may be used as a viable alternative to ownership. *Appropriateness of chosen format (printed, digital, audio, visual) for the subject matter. *Cost of the material. *Critical reviews of the material. With purchasing new books also comes weeding out books from the collection to make room for the new. Evaluation for possible removal from the collection includes the following criteria: *Age of titles in relation to subject matter. *Duplication (multiple copies which are no longer needed). *Physical condition. *Use (past circulation record). *Authoritativeness. *Curricular value. *Superseded editing *Title is not 'last copy' in University of Wisconsin System library collections. Special collections The LRC houses some unique collections and most of them can be found on the 6th floor of the building in the government documents area. Native American (NA) Collection: This collection features many one-of-a-kind documents and books related to Native American tribes in Wisconsin. This collection is housed on the 6th floor and maintained by the government documents staff. Assassination Collection: This collection was created by David Wrone, in cooperation with the library staff. Dr. Wrone is an emeritus History professor at UWSP. This collection focuses on the Kennedy assassination documents, and it is unique in its organization. Rare Books: This collection is housed on the 6th floor and maintained by the government documents staff and assisted by professors in the History department. =Associated departments= WCEE: The Wisconsin Center for Environmental Education (WCEE) is a department in the library that houses books on K-12 environmental education. It assists in the development, dissemination, implementation and evaluation of teacher and student K-12 Environmental Education programs. UWSP is recognized throughout the state for having these resources. The WCEE is unique, with its own interlibrary Loan department and system of checking out books. The Center is housed on the 3rd floor and has its own staff. You can find more information on the WCEE here: The Wisconsin Center for Environmental Education WIPCS: The Wisconsin Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies (WIPCS) on the second floor of the library is the headquarters of the institute, which ‚Äúis a unique and vital consortium of private and public colleges and universities dedicated to enriching academic and public discourse on issues of peace and conflict.‚Äù The LRC hosts the WIPCS office headquarters, its website, and entire collection. Information Literacy and Bibliographic Instruction The LRC, like many libraries, has an actual library resource course taught by faculty librarians. At UWSP this course is called Library Resources 101, and it is specifically for students on campus. =Information Literacy= The course is designed to instruct students on how to use and benefit from the library's resources. There are numerous sections, which are offered each academic semester, and occasionally during the summer terms. This is a one credit elective course. It can be taken online or in person at the library. =Bibliographic Instruction (BI)= Throughout the fall, spring, and summer semesters, informal BI sessions are taught in the LRC. They are taught by faculty librarians on an \\"on demand basis.\\" Public services =Community patrons= Community patrons are allowed to use the LRC, but are restricted to certain areas and are instructed to follow specific rules. *If you live in Portage County, you can access our collection through the Portage County Public Library's catalog. *You will need to obtain a Portage County Public Library card (if you do not already have one) to borrow materials from the University Library. The PCPL card can also be used to request University Library items to be delivered to one of the PCPL locations. Non-university borrowers may check out stack's books for four weeks. They are allowed one renewal of the book for an additional four weeks. =Visitors to the area= *If you are visiting the University Library and are neither a resident of Portage County nor a UW- System card holder, you will need to get a Guest Card if you wish to check out resources. Guest Cards are available at the Main Circulation desk located on the Library's first floor. You must be eighteen years of age and present a valid driver's license or state identification card. Student and faculty services =Loan periods= Undergraduates may check out stacks books for four weeks. They are allowed one renewal of the book for an additional four weeks. Graduate students may also check out books for four weeks, however, they are allowed unlimited renewals if there is no hold on the material they wish to renew. =Faculty= Faculty are allowed to check out books for an entire term and are allowed renewals after that time period.

Leprosy control in Korea under Japanese occupation There were about 15,000-20,000 leprosy patients chiefly in the southern parts of Korean Peninsula. There were 3 sanatoriums run by foreigners at the time of annexation (1910). In 1916, the Japanese Government established a hospital in Sorok Island and hospitalized 100 patients. In 1933, Suho became the director and started to establish a big sanatorium. He himself worked with the planning, buying of construction materials and construction works. He forced the patients to work in the construction. He also made a statue of himself in the island and forced the patients to worship the statue.

The UK Albums Chart is a music chart compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling artist albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2005, the chart has been based on the sales of both physical and digital albums, on the condition that the album was available in both formats. In 2007, the rules were changed so that legal downloads of all albums, irrespective of whether a physical copy was available, were eligible to chart. Between 2000 and 2009, more than 100 albums sold more than 1 million copies in the United Kingdom. At the end of the decade, a retrospective chart was compiled by the Official Charts Company to determine the best-selling artist album of this ten-year period. The title was won by James Blunt, with his debut album Back to Bedlam, released in 2004. The album sold 3.19 million copies, finishing ahead of Dido's album No Angel, which sold 3.05 million copies. Dido featured twice in the top 10 best-sellers, with Life for Rent being the seventh best-seller of the decade. Amy Winehouse (3), Leona Lewis (4) and David Gray (5) were the other solo-artists to feature. The Beatles' compilation album 1 was the highest entry by a group in the chart at number 6; Coldplay (8), Keane (9) and Scissor Sisters (10) made up the rest of the top ten. Robbie Williams had the most albums on the list with five entries. BBC Radio 1 announced the chart in a programme, presented by DJ Nihal, on 28 December 2009. The list of the best- selling albums of the decade in the United Kingdom was also announced in a series of three shows between 29 and 31 December 2009. As it was broadcast during the last week of December, the chart did not include sales from the final week of the year. An updated chart, including sales up to 31 December 2009 and containing some minor changes from the chart broadcast on Radio 1, was published in the UK trade magazine Music Week in the issue dated 30 January 2010. The list of the best-selling compilation albums of the decade in the UK Compilation Chart was dominated by the Now That's What I Call Music! series of albums. The best-selling compilation album of the 2000s was Now 47 with 1,371,324 copies sold, ahead of Now 50 with 1,367,380 copies. The best- selling soundtrack album of the decade was Mamma Mia! The Movie Soundtrack, with a total of 1,320,357 to the end of 2009. Best-selling albums Amy Winehouse had the third best-selling album of the decade with Back to Black, which later became the UK's best-selling album of the 21st century (only to later be overtaken by Adele's 21). Robbie Williams had the most entries in the top 100 best-selling albums chart with five. Swing When You're Winning charted at number 17, followed by Greatest Hits (19), Sing When You're Winning (20), Escapology (22) and Intensive Care (55). Coldplay had four entries in the chart: A Rush of Blood to the Head (8), X&Y; (12), Parachutes (13) and Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (90). Eminem had three albums on the list. The Marshall Mathers LP was the 16th best-selling album, while The Eminem Show (61) and Curtain Call: The Hits (89) also appeared. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" !scope=col !scope=col Title !scope=col Artist !scope=col Peak position !scope=col Year of release !scope=col Sales -

Summary The documentary opens showing how Ponijao comes into the world in a modest hut after her mother rubs some red pigment all over her pregnancy-swollen belly. Hattie, on the other hand, arrives in a Western birthing center surrounded by medical equipment and technicians. Another scene shows Bayar being born and tightly swaddled in a hospital, before heading off with his parents and a sibling on a motorcycle to the rural area where the family lives. Other highlights include Mari's tantrum when she is frustrated with a toy, Hattie getting bored during an organized play session, Bayar taking a bath while a goat comes to drink from the same water, and Ponijao fighting with a sibling when they are playing on the ground. The documentary shows the contrasts of the four cultures without using any form of narration, leaving it to the viewers to interpret the film. Reception Babies received generally positive reviews. 69% of ninety-one reviews on the site Rotten Tomatoes favored the film. The site's consensus is that \\"Babies is a joyous celebration of humankind that's loaded with adorable images, but it lacks insight and depth.\\" The film received a score of sixty- three on Metacritic.

Hicks (August 18, 1933 ‚Äì August 25, 2013) was an African-American journalist, activist, editor, and music educator. He died in New York. Life Born in Boston, Hicks wrote for the Boston Chronicle while still in high school. He graduated from Drake University. After writing for the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper, he moved to New York City. In 1960, he founded and chaired the On Guard Committee for Freedom. A Black nationalist literary organization in the Lower East Side. Its members included Nannie and Walter Bowe, Harold Cruse, Amiri Baraka, Tom Dent, Rosa Guy, Joe Johnson, Archie Shepp, Walter Bowe, and Sarah Wright, among others. On Guard participated in protests one being the protest at the United Nations of the American-sponsored Bay of Pigs Cuban invasion and was active in support of the Congolese liberation leader Patrice Lumumba. The organization viewed the liberation of Africa as part of the struggle for Black liberation in the United States. On Guard went on to publish their own newspaper with Hicks as the editor. In typical male chauvinist fashion, Sarah E. Wright was by-passed and her contribution as founder ignored. Hicks was executive director of the Monroe Defense Committee in support of Robert F. Williams, and was active in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He was one of the founders of Umbra Magazine, with poet and writer Tom Dent. Hicks was also a member of the Harlem Writers Guild, and active in the Black Arts Movement, where he is considered to have been one of the primary players.\\"Making an impact as a responsible global citizen\\", The Times‚ÄìDelphic, April 23, 2012. As a freelance writer, his articles appeared in Freedomways, New Challenge, New York Age. He worked as an instructor at Brooklyn College, Richmond College (now known as College of Staten Island) and City College of New York.
